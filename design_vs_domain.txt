DOMAIN MODELS
		During the analysis phase of a software engineering project, 
		domain models are developed as descriptions of a domain problem  
		that are not dependent on any particular solution.

		They are solution-independent, sometimes known as “computation-independent,” 
		in the sense that they are not concerned with making any system design decisions 
		or with other computational concerns.

DESIGN MODELS
		During the design phase, a platform-independent design model is first 
		produced on the basis of the domain model.

		This platform-independent design model serves as a generic computational
		solution to the software engineering challenge that has been presented

		The same domain model has the ability to be utilised to build many 
		(even drastically different) design models that each reflect a distinct
		set of design options


DIFFERENCE
		In design model you have to specify the type of properties and methods etc,
		while in domain model you only have to write them without anything additional
		(just like in real world)
		
		quindi per riassumere i domain models sono descrittivi degli elementi che troviamo 
		nel sistema e di quali relazioni intercorrono tra essi
		
		mentre i design models basandosi sulle descrizioni fornite dai domain models formulano 
		delle soluzioni ai problemi che ci imponiamo di risolvere nello strutturare il sistema 
		senza pero usare un linguaggio che vincola l'implementazione del sistema stesso(ad esempio 
		non usiamo "jsoup" da java, ma piu genericamente "html parser")
