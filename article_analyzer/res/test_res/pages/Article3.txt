Met
plan
to
stop
mental
health
response
will
leave
thousands
‘without
support’

Health
groups
raise
alarm
after
Sir
Mark
Rowley
says
he
will
order
officers
not
to
attend
999
calls
about
mental
health
incidents
Thousands
of
people
in
a
mental
health
crisis
will
be
“left
without
support”
under
worrying
and
inappropriate
police
plans
to
“walk
away”
from
emergency
incidents,

health
chiefs
have
said.
In
a
letter
seen
by
the
Guardian,
the
Metropolitan
police
comissioner,
Sir
Mark
Rowley,
said
that
from
September

he
would
order
the
force’s
police
officers
not
to
attend
thousands
of
999
calls
about
mental
health
incidents.
The
move
by
Scotland
Yard,
which
employs
nearly
a
quarter
of
all
officers
in
England
and
Wales,
follows
the
rollout
of
a
similar
policy
in
Humberside.
The
change
would
help
free
up
resources
to
focus
on
solving
crime,
Rowley
said.
But
health
chiefs
have
raised
the
alarm
about
the
plans,
suggesting
that
vulnerable
people
would
be
“left
in
limbo”
and
put
at
risk
of
harm.
They
also
pointed
out
that
only
the
police
could
publicly
section
people
in
a
mental
health
crisis.
Rowley
has
given
health
and
social
care
services
a
deadline
of
31
August
before
launching
the
ban,
which
will
be
waived
only
if
a
threat
to
life
is
feared.
His
letter
to
the
Met’s
health
and
social
care
partners
was
sent
on
24
May,
giving
them
just
three
months
to
plan
for
the
change.
Dr
Adrian
James,
the
president
of
the
Royal
College
of
Psychiatrists,
called
the
sudden
move
“unhelpful”
and
raised
concerns
about
the
“resources
that
will
be
necessary
to
plug
those
gaps”.
“We
don’t
have
those
resources,”
he
said.
“We
also
have
a
workforce
crisis
in
the
health
service.
We
can’t
just
pluck
new
members
of
staff
from
nowhere.”
Sarah
Hughes,
the
chief
executive
of
Mind,
said
there
was
not
enough
capacity
in
the
NHS
to
replace
the
work
currently
carried
out
by
police
officers,

and
raised
concerns
about
the
timing
of
the
plan.
She
also
rejected
suggestions
that
999
mental
health
incidents
should
not
be
a
core
part
of
policing.
“Any
changes
to
supporting
people
in
a
mental
health
crisis
need
to
be
thought
through
carefully
and
collectively
so
that
no
one
is
left
without
support.
She
added:
“It
is
right
to
say
that
when
people
are
in
a
mental
health
crisis,
they
are
often
at
their
most
vulnerable,
so
really
need
the
right
support.

It
is
also
right
to
say
that
mental
health
is
core
police
business,
for
example,
only
the
police
can
publicly
section
people
in
mental
health
crisis.”
Andy
Bell,
the
chief
executive
of
the
Centre
for
Mental
Health,
said:
“It’s
a
worrying
sign
of
the
rising
levels
of
need
for
mental
health
crisis
care
that
the
Metropolitan
police
are
threatening
not
to
respond
to
emergency
calls.
“It’s
right
to
expect
that
health
and
social
services
should
be
there
for
people
in
a
mental
health
crisis,”
he
told
the
Guardian.
“But
they
are
struggling
to
keep
up
with
rising
demand
for
urgent
care
after
years
of
austerity,
especially
in
social
services.”
Brian
Dow,
the
deputy
chief
executive
of
Rethink
Mental
Illness,
said
it
was
“not
appropriate”
for
the
Met
to
have
“simply
imposed
an
artificial
deadline
and
threatened
to
walk
away”.
The
risk
was
“that
people
in
crisis
are
left
in
limbo
between
two
struggling
public
services”,
he
added.
“Individuals
in
mental
health
crisis
need
urgent
access
to
the
right
kind
of
treatment
and
support
to
help
them
through
the
emergency,
and
on
occasion
this
will
involve
the
police
when
they
pose
a
risk
to
themselves
or
others
…
“The
solution
lies
in
the
police,
mental
health
services,
the
voluntary
sector
and
the
government
getting
around
the
table
and
figuring
out
the
answer,
with
the
government
addressing
the
very
significant
funding
gap
that
exists.”
The
Met
plan
was
“potentially
alarming”
and
risked
creating
a
“vacuum”,
said
Zoe
Billingham,
a
former
inspector
of
constabulary.
Speaking
to
BBC
Radio
4’s
Today
programme,
she
said
there
was
“simply
no
other
agency
to
call”
other
than
the
police
for
people
in
crisis,
adding:
“There
isn’t
another
agency
to
step
in
and
fill
the
vacuum.”
A
spokesperson
for
the
NHS
in
London
told
the
Guardian
it
would
continue
to
work
with
the
