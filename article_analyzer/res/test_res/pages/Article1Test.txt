‘I’ve
been
too
scared
to
go
to
work’:
my
life
as
a
builder
in
badly
behaved
Britain

I
get
all
sorts
of
awkward
customers,
many
of
whom
look
for
any
excuse
not
to
pay.
But
it’s
the
overly
friendly
ones
you
have
to
worry
about
I
have
been
a
builder
since
I
was
a
teenager.
I
have
also
worked
as
a
fisher
and
a
tree
surgeon,
but
I
always
return
to
building,
because
it’s
the
one
thing
I
think
I’m
good
at.
We
get
all
sorts
of
awkward
customers
–
especially
after
a
job
has
been
completed.
Once,
I
was
called
at
5am:
a
towel
rail
was
hanging
45
degrees
off
the
wall.
When
I
arrived
at
the
property,
the
husband
looked
terribly
sheepish
and
the
wife
said:
“It
just
fell
off.”
She
took
the
kids
to
school
while
the
husband
said:
“OK,
what
do
we
need
to
fix
it?”
I
bolted
it
back
on,
but
when
the
wife
returned
she
said:
“We’re
not
paying.
It
was
clearly
your
mistake.”
I
imagine
the
husband
had
tripped
over
a
kid’s
toy,
or
something,
and
ripped
it
off
the
wall.
On
another
occasion,
I
had
been
called
to
fix
a
roof
that
required
re-slating.
It
took
a
couple
of
days.
After
I
had
finished
the
job,
I
got
a
call
from
the
client,
who
said
the
slates
were
falling
off.
When
I
went
back,
there
were
all
these
ladders
–
clearly,
they
had
been
up
to
have
a
look
at
the
roof,
not
trusting
that
I
had
completed
the
job
properly.

They
must
have
been
wobbling
around
and
broken
some
of
the
slates,
which
had
fallen
off.
They
insisted
no
one
had
been
up
there.

It
took
me
another
two
or
three
hours
to
fix
it
–
unpaid,
again,
because
supposedly
it
was
my
fault.
There
has
always
been
bad
behaviour
to
contend
with
in
this
job.
When
I
started
as
a
teenager,
I
was
working
with
a
friend,
whose
father
was
also
a
builder,

and
we
got
too
scared
to
go
to
work.
The
customer
–
a
woman
in
her
40s
–
was
wearing
less
and
less
clothing
each
day
we
turned
up.
She
kept
saying:

“Have
you
got
a
girlfriend?”
I
was
still
at
sixth
form
college
and
terrified,
so
we
bailed
on
the
job.
I
also
know
a
painter
who
went
to
work
for
a
different
woman
and
found
her
lying
on
the
bed,
expectantly.
He
said
he
just
shut
the
bedroom
door
and
started
painting.

Half
an
hour
later,
she
appeared,
fully
clothed,
and
said:
“Would
you
like
a
cup
of
tea?”
like
nothing
had
happened.
The
pandemic
didn’t
really
change
things.
There
haven’t
been
enough
people
in
the
trade
for
a
decade.
Both
my
sons
are
now
at
university;
when
they
were
growing
up,

I
had
thought
they
might
help
me,
but
they
earned
more
working
as
baristas
than
I
could
afford
to
pay
them.
I
get
all
my
work
through
word
of
mouth.
First-person
referrals
mean
I
can’t
mess
up
–
but
neither
can
the
customer.
My
whole
ethos
is:
I
don’t
care
how
long
it
takes
or
how
much
it
costs,
you
get
what
you
want.
People
ring
up
saying:
“Another
builder
has
gone
badly
wrong.
Can
you
take
over?”
It’s
always
because
they
went
with
the
cheapest
quote.
Often,
they
have
been
quoted
less
than
the
cost
of
the
raw
materials,
so
no
wonder
it
went
wrong.
You
get
what
you
pay
for.
