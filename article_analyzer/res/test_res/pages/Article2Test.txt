Russia-Ukraine
war
at
a
glance:
what
we
know
on
day
460
of
the
invasion
At
least
one
person
hospitalised
after
daytime
missile
attack
on
Kyiv;
Ukraine
claims
to
have
shot
down
37
missiles
and
29
drones
overnight

At
least
one
person
has
been
hospitalised
after
a
wave
of
explosions
were
heard
in
Kyiv
during
Monday
morning.
Mayor
Vitali
Kitschko
said
that
the
person
had
been
in
the
Podilskyi
district
in
the
north
of
the
city.
The
local
authority
reported
that
the
roof
of
a
two-story
building
caught
fire
in
the
district
as
a
result
of
falling
debris,
but
that
the
fire
was
contained.

“The
enemy
used
missiles
of
a
ballistic
trajectory
–
preliminarily
Iskanders.
There
is
a
possibility
that
S-300
and
S-400
missiles
were
also
used,

”
air
force
spokesperson
Yuri
Ihnat
told
Ukrainian
TV.
Ukraine
reported
that
Russia
launched
up
to
40
cruise
missiles
and
about
35
drones
overnight:
air
defence
claimed
to
have
shot
down
37
missiles
and
29
“Shahed”drones.
An
unspecified
military
target
in
the
western
Khmelnytskyi
region
was
struck,
with
the
regional
governor
reporting
that
“five
aircraft
were
disabled”
and
that
a
fire
had
broken
out
in
a
fuel
warehouse.
In
Odesa,
fragments
of
a
downed
kamikaze
drone
hit
the
port
infrastructure
causing
a
fire,
and
rockets
and
drones
were
shot
down
over
Lviv,
Kirovohrad,
Poltava
and
Mykolaiv
regions.
Serhii
Popko,
the
head
of
Kyiv’s
military
administration
said
Russia
was
trying
to
exhaust
the
country’s
air
defences
with
the
increased
attacks,
adding
“the
enemy
is
trying
to
keep
the
civilian
population
in
deep
psychological
tension”.
Mayor
Klitschko
added:
“Another
difficult
night
for
the
capital.
But,
thanks
to
the
professionalism
of
our
defenders,
as
a
result
of
the
air
attack
of
the
barbarians
in
Kyiv,
there
was
no
damage
or
destruction
of
infrastructural
and
other
objects.
The
Kyiv
city
administration
has
posted
to
Telegram
to
state
that
“during
the
daytime
shelling
of
the
capital,
more
than
41,000
people
were
in
the
underground”
today,
and
that
overnight
“more
than
9,000
citizens
took
refuge
in
subway
stations,
including
1,120
children”.
It
claimed
“this
is
the
largest
number
of
people
who
stayed
at
the
stations
at
night
during
the
current
month”.
Wagner
boss
Yevgheny
Prigozhin
“appears
to
have
again
indirectly
undermined
Russian
president
Vladimir
Putin’s
authority
and
regime”,
the
Institute
for
the
Study
of
War
(ISW)
has
written
in
its
latest
analysis
of
the
conflict.
The
US-based
think
tank
bases
its
assertion
on
the
response
given
by
Prigozhin
to
a
journalist
asking
about
Russian
state
media’s
ban
on
any
discussion
of
Wagner.
Prigozhin
said
that
officials
could
have
benefited
from
their
historic
ability
to
censor
information
if
Russia
had
not
declared
war
on
Ukraine.
He
then
shifted
to
addressing
a
single,
unnamed
official:
“If
you
are
starting
a
war,
please
have
character,
will,
and
steel
balls
-
and
only
then
you
will
be
able
to
achieve
something.”
The
adviser
to
the
head
of
the
office
of
Ukraine’s
president,
Mykhailo
Podolyak,
has
suggested
that
any
peace
settlement
acceptable
to
Ukraine
would
include
not
only
a
restoration
of
the
country’s
sovereign
borders,
but
a
demilitarised
zone
extending
between
100km
and
120km
into
Russia.
The
foreign
ministers
of
Sweden
and
Turkey
will
meet
“soon”
to
discuss
Stockholm’s
delayed
bid
to
join
Nato,
the
Swedish
foreign
ministry
said
on
Monday.
Foreign
investors
who
left
Russia
after
selling
their
businesses
there
between
March
2022
and
March
2023
withdrew
about
$36
billion
from
the
country,
the
state
RIA
news
agency,
citing
analysis
of
data
from
the
Central
Bank.
The
death
toll
from
a
Russian
missile
attack
on
a
medical
facility
in
Dnipro
on
Friday
has
risen
from
two
to
four
people,
according
to
the
region’s
governor.
Russian
attacks
near
the
eastern
city
of
Bakhmut,
the
scene
of
heavy
fighting
in
recent
months,
abated
slightly
over
the
weekend,
according
to
a
spokesperson
for
the
Ukrainian
military.
Thousands
of
children
have
been
kidnapped
and
taken
to
Russia
since
Moscow’s
full-scale
invasion
of
Ukraine
in
February
last
year.
According
to
the
Ukrainian
government,
16,226
children
have
been
deported
to
Russia,
of
whom
10,513
have
been
located,
and
more
than
300
have
returned.
Some
fear
the
numbers
of
missing
could
be
an
underestimate.
Children
apparently
from
occupied
Ukraine
were
paraded
at
a
pro-Putin
rally
in
Moscow
in
February.

Belarusian
leader
Alexander
Lukashenko
has
said
that
if
any
other
country
wants
to
join
a
Russia-Belarus
union
there
could
be
“nuclear
weapons
for
everyone”.
Russia
moved
ahead
last
week
with
a
plan
to
deploy
tactical
nuclear
weapons
in
Belarus,
in
the
Kremlin’s
first
deployment
of
such
warheads
outside
Russia
since

the

Russia’s
interior
ministry
has
put
US
senator
Lindsey
Graham
on
a
wanted
list,
Russian
news
agency
Tass
has
reported.
The
Russian
ambassador
to
the
UK,
Andrei
Kelin,
told
the
BBC
that
the
west’s
supplying
of
weapons
to
Ukraine
risked
escalating
the
conflict
to
levels
not
yet
seen.

Russia
had
“enormous
resources
and
we
haven’t
just
started
yet
to
act
very
seriously”,
he
said.
Russia
said
its
air
defence
systems
destroyed
several
drones
as
they
approached
the
Ilsky
oil
refinery
in
the
Krasnodar
region
near
the
Black
Sea
on
Sunday.

“Several
unmanned
aerial
vehicles
(UAVs)
tried
to
approach
the
territory
of
the
Ilsky
oil
refinery
in
the
Krasnodar
Krai,”
the
region’s
emergency
officials

said
on
the
Telegram
messaging
channel.
“All
of
them
were
neutralized,
the
infrastructure
of
the
plant
was
not
damaged.”
It
was

possible
to
verify
the
report.
South

has
appointed
a
panel
to
investigate
US
allegations
that
a
Russian
ship
collected
weapons
from
a
naval
base
near
Cape
Town
last
year,
the
presidency
said
in
a
statement.
The
allegations
have
caused
a
diplomatic
row
between
the
US,
South
Africa
and
Russia
and
called
into
question
South
Africa’s
non-aligned
position
on
the
Ukraine
conflict.
