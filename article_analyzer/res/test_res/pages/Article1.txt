customers
many

whom
look
for
any
excuse

But

the
overly
friendly
ones
you
have

worry
about

have
been

builder
since

was

teenager

have
also
worked

fisher
and

tree
surgeon
but

always
return

building
because

the
one
thing

think

good

get
all
sorts

awkward
customers
especially
after

job
has
been
completed
Once

was
called

towel
rail
was
hanging

degrees
off
the
wall
When

arrived

the
property
the
husband
looked
terribly
sheepish
and
the
wife
said

just
fell
off
She
took
the
kids

school
while
the
husband
said

what

need

fix

bolted

back

but
when
the
wife
returned
she
said

not
paying

was
clearly
your
mistake

imagine
the
husband
had
tripped
over

kid

toy

something
and
ripped

off
the
wall

another

After

from
the
client
who
said
the
slates
were
falling
off
When

went
back
there
were
all
these
ladders
clearly
they
had
been

have

look

the
roof
not
trusting
that

had
completed
the
job
properly
They
must
have
been
wobbling
around
and
broken
some

the
slates
which
had
fallen
off
They
insisted

one
had
been

there


took

another
two

three
hours

fix

unpaid

There

always
been
bad
behaviour

job
When

started

teenager

and

got
too
scared

The
customer

was
wearing
less
and
less
clothing
each
day

She
kept
saying

and
found
her
lying

bed
expectantly

said

just

door
and
started
painting

Half

hour
later
she
appeared
fully
clothed
and
said
Would
you
like

cup

tea
like
nothing
had
happened
The
pandemic
didn

really
change
things
There
haven

been
enough
people

the
trade
for

decade
Both

sons
are
now

university
when
they
were
growing



had
thought
they
might
help

but
they
earned
more
working

baristas
than

could
afford

pay
them

get
all

work
through
word

mouth
First-person
referrals
mean

can

mess


but
neither
can
the
customer

whole
ethos


don

care
how
long

takes

how
much

costs
you
get
what
you
want
People
ring

saying
Another
builder
has
gone
badly
wrong
Can
you
take
over

always
because
they
went
with
the
cheapest
quote
Often
they
have
been
quoted
less
than
the
cost

the
raw
materials


wonder

went
wrong
You
get
what
you
pay
for
