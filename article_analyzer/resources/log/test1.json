The building at 740 Park Avenue has been home to John D Rockefeller Jr, Blackstone founder Stephen Schwarzman, David Koch of the Koch brothers and Donald Trump’s treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin. An apartment in the building currently on the market is going for $27.5m. Umbrellas up, outside the building, the lawmakers promised to fight to ensure the wealthy in New York are fairly taxed. “A little rain is not going to stop us and neither are decades of trickle-down economics,” said Jabari Brisport, a state senator. Lawmakers across seven states, including New York, are working together to introduce higher taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations in their respective legislatures. Along with New York, legislators from California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland and Washington have been working on bills that would increase taxes for the wealthy living in their states. Many of the new proposals include taxes on the overall wealth of the rich, not just on their annual income. In 2021, ProPublica released a report based off a trove of tax documents from the wealthy that showed how the rich avoid paying income tax. It showed that in some years, the wealthiest billionaires sometimes avoided income tax altogether by holding and adding to their wealth through stock and property ownership, which are taxed at lower rates than income. Joe Biden introduced a 20% “wealth tax” at the federal level, which would apply toward an individual “total income”, including growth in their assets like stocks, when proposing his budget last spring. But with Republicans showing no interest in wealth taxes, progressives are hoping that taxes on the super wealthy can happen at the state level. In New York, progressive lawmakers are looking to pass the Invest in New York package, which will include a slate of tax reforms on extreme wealth. The tax reform includes adding new tax brackets for the highest earners, higher corporate taxes for the wealthiest companies and wealth taxes on capital gains, including unrealized capital gains, and inheritance. Over a dozen state senators have signed on to the proposal. “We are tired of subsidizing billionaires here in New York. For a long time, we see how they underpay employees at work and then at home, the workers who help them are also unpaid,” said state senator Jessica Ramos, who is proposing a tax on unrealized capital gains. “When that happens, we end up having to step up with services to help those families make ends meet.” State senator Gustavo Rivera, who is proposing higher taxes on long-term capital gains, said the lawmakers are unconcerned about the wealthy leaving New York, a point often brought up by opponents of a wealth tax. “This notion that they will leave is not true. It does not happen. They live here, they have Broadway, they have restaurants, they have culture, they have Central Park. They’re not going to move,” Rivera said. Activists and lawmakers at Thursday’s rally called on the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, to work with them to pass higher wealth taxes. Hochul last month said she did not think raising taxes “makes sense” after the state passed tax cuts, primarily aimed at the middle class, last year. “I don’t believe that raising taxes, at a time when we just cut taxes, makes sense,” she said in December. “We are not going to turn around and say last year we lowered your taxes, now we are raising them. So, I don’t foresee that.” Thursday’s rally and the unveiling of the wealth taxes across the blue states coincided with Wednesday’s release of a letter from 205 members of the global super-rich elite who called on governments around the world to “tax us, the ultra rich, now”. The letter signers, including Abigail Disney and actor Mark Ruffalo, urged lawmakers to “tackle extreme wealth” via taxes. “Defending democracy and building cooperation requires action to build fairer economies to build fairer economies right now – it is not a problem that can be left for our children to fix,” the letter said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/06/australias-first-nuclear-submarines-should-be-built-in-the-us-andrew-hastie-says","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-05T14:00:45Z","webTitle":"Australia’s first nuclear submarines should be built in the US, Andrew Hastie says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/06/australias-first-nuclear-submarines-should-be-built-in-the-us-andrew-hastie-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/06/australias-first-nuclear-submarines-should-be-built-in-the-us-andrew-hastie-says","fields":{"bodyText":"Australia should strike a deal with the US to have the first of its nuclear-powered submarines built in Connecticut as “there’s too much risk in doing it on our own”, the shadow defence minister, Andrew Hastie, has declared. Speaking before senior Australian ministers meet their counterparts in the US this week, Hastie said Australia should seek one or two Virginia-class submarines off the US production line by the end of 2030. Hastie did not deny this may require Australia to subsidise the expansion of the US’s already-crowded production line, but said the strategic circumstances meant there was no time to waste. Authoritarian powers were “on the move” and it would take too long to start the flagship Aukus project with Australian domestic production, he said. “Too long, too long – and there’s too much risk in doing it on our own,” Hastie said. “We need to get a boat in the water, or two boats in the water, and at the same time be building the capacity here.” The opposition leader and former defence minister, Peter Dutton, has previously floated the idea of buying the first submarines from the US, but Hastie’s new comments strengthen those calls at a critical time. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Aukus will be at the top of the agenda when the defence minister, Richard Marles, and foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, hold annual talks with their US counterparts, Lloyd Austin and Antony Blinken, in Washington DC this week. Marles is also expected to join the US ambassador to Australia, Caroline Kennedy, on a visit to the site in Connecticut that builds nuclear submarines. Hastie called for “increased diplomatic engagement with the United States, not just across the legislature, but also through the bureaucracy”. “The US has been making nuclear subs for a long time, so this isn’t new to them. It is special to us – and you’ve really got to make sure our presence is known in Washington DC.” Hastie said it would make “total sense to get a boat or two off the production line into the water” this decade but this should not delay work to train Australian submarine crews and develop base facilities. “Simultaneously we should be building our industrial base as well, searching for talent at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels for people who will be part of this nation-building industry,” he said. Hastie cited the former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd’s warnings that China was on track “to take action against Taiwan from sometime in the late 2020s or in 2030s”. Hastie said Australia needed options during this “Rudd window” including new missiles and unmanned platforms such as drones. “We need hard power, which gives us a deterrent against a would-be adversary. That means we need to be able to reach out and ring someone’s bell at distance and demonstrate risk in picking a fight with Australia,” he said. “I think that’s what Aukus will deliver when we get our nuclear submarines, but we also need to look at other strike capabilities, whether they be unmanned or manned platforms, both subsurface and surface.” Hastie said he was open minded about options that may be suggested by the defence strategic review conducted the former Australian defence force chief Angus Houston and the former Labor defence minister Stephen Smith. “We want to work constructively with the government,” Hastie said. “Our mission is the same as theirs and that is to have a strong Australia that’s capable of resisting an aggressor.” Hastie said the war in Ukraine proved Australia also needed to strengthen its supply lines: “As a trading nation with the vast majority of our imports coming across the seas, we need to think about how we’re building our fuel stocks, our pharmaceutical stocks, and other essentials.” Australia, the US and the UK have set a March deadline for decisions on how Canberra’s plans for at least eight nuclear-powered powered submarines can be achieved. Any push for an offshore build, at least for the first couple of submarines, could be politically contentious in South Australia. The Labor premier of South Australia, Peter Malinauskas, has said it would “not be acceptable” for his state to miss out on promised submarine manufacturing jobs. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, is due to attend a meeting of the Aukus defence ministers in Washington DC later this week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jul/03/poor-households-face-having-to-help-foot-bill-for-building-sizewell-c","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-03T15:15:54Z","webTitle":"Poor households face having to help foot bill for building Sizewell C","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/03/poor-households-face-having-to-help-foot-bill-for-building-sizewell-c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jul/03/poor-households-face-having-to-help-foot-bill-for-building-sizewell-c","fields":{"bodyText":"The UK government has been criticised for exposing low-income households to the cost of building the Sizewell C nuclear power plant while letting factories “off the hook” as a crucial planning decision is due this week. If given the green light, the government hopes to use a regulated asset base (RAB) funding model to finance the project, which is being proposed by the French energy firm EDF. RAB reduces the risk to investors, who will receive regular payments before the project begins generating power. However, it also means customers pay for the construction costs through higher energy bills. A consultation on using the RAB model is due to close next month and shows operators in energy-intensive industries would be exempt but households receiving universal credit would have to pay. In the consultation, officials said the exemption for electricity-intensive users – such as factories – would avoid the risk of putting them at a “significant competitive disadvantage” when operating in international markets as they may have to add the costs to the price of their products. MPs had suggested electricity suppliers should be prevented from recovering the costs of their RAB payment obligations from consumers who are on universal credit. However, officials rejected this idea, saying such a measure could “disincentivise suppliers from engaging in commercially beneficial practices” such as payment plans and loyalty benefits to attract customers. They also argued other vulnerable consumers not claiming universal credit could also be affected by the move. The Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, said: “When energy bills are skyrocketing right in the middle of a cost of living scandal, the last thing that people can afford is the ballooning cost of embryonic nuclear white elephants like Sizewell C. “Not only are these projects extremely expensive to build in the first place, with Hinkley Point C now at £26bn without having generated a single watt of energy, the RAB business model passes that enormous upfront cost directly on to the consumer. While giant companies are spared with generous exemptions, the very worst-off in society will be footing the bill. Nuclear is too slow, too expensive and the wrong priority.” The 3.2 gigawatt plant at Sizewell in Suffolk could be capable of generating electricity for 6m homes and is part of a project to approve a nuclear reactor each year by 2030. Alison Downes, of the Stop Sizewell C campaign, said: “Taxes of any kind hit the poorest hardest and this nuclear tax is no exception. Multimillion-pound businesses will be let off the hook if they use a lot of energy but a family on universal credit struggling to afford its heating bills will have to cough up to pay for an unwanted nuclear power station.” The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said the government considerd it very important to support low-income households but believed that “support for vulnerable groups would be best tackled holistically” by looking at the factors driving up energy bills. BEIS has estimated that Sizewell C would add an extra £1 a month to household bills to aid construction costs. But research by the University of Greenwich business school seen by the Guardian shows the average monthly cost could reach £2.12. In January, the government earmarked £100m to advance Sizewell C to the next stage of negotiations, and help the project attract further private investment. In May, it pushed back the deadline for a decision on a “development consent order” for Sizewell C from 25 May to 8 July. Ministers have tasked Barclays to lead a search for investors to back the project alongside the government and EDF, which each plan to take a 20% stake. That structure would force out CGN, the state-backed Chineses nuclear specialist that has a 20% stake in Sizewell C venture. According to the Mail on Sunday, the British Gas owner, Centrica, is considering taking a stake. CGN has partnered with EDF on the Hinkley Point C in Somerset – which has been delayed and is over budget – but ministers want to avoid further Chinese involvement amid worsening relations between the UK and China."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/28/how-the-climate-crisis-is-threatening-power-supply-stability","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-28T05:00:21Z","webTitle":"How the climate crisis is threatening power supply stability","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/28/how-the-climate-crisis-is-threatening-power-supply-stability","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/28/how-the-climate-crisis-is-threatening-power-supply-stability","fields":{"bodyText":"Weather forecasting has become an important factor in keeping the lights on. It also enables producers of power to match their output to times of peak demand and so command the highest prices, boosting profits. However, climate change is making the whole process much more difficult. Extreme weather events – high winds, heatwaves, freezing rain, and loss of glaciers and snow pack mean once reliable sources of power can fail. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says 87% of global electricity comes from nuclear, hydro and thermal fossil fuel plants that rely on water for cooling, and up to a third of these are in high water stress areas. Predicting droughts, stream flows and water availability is therefore vital for maintaining supply. For solar and wind, where water is less of an issue, predicting wind strength and sunshine hours is key. In countries with highly variable weather, such as the UK, this is still a work in progress, although improving all the time. Partly, these problems can be mitigated by giant batteries and well-tried technologies, such as pump storage, where water is pumped back uphill at night for hydro-power production at peak times. But even without Russia cutting gas flows to Europe, keeping power supplies stable in a changing climate is an increasing challenge everywhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/sep/23/putins-nuclear-threat-shows-a-desperate-man-out-of-options","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-23T07:00:28Z","webTitle":"Putin’s nuclear threat shows a desperate man out of options | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/23/putins-nuclear-threat-shows-a-desperate-man-out-of-options","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/23/putins-nuclear-threat-shows-a-desperate-man-out-of-options","fields":{"bodyText":"Vladimir Putin is ready to use a nuclear weapon in his ongoing attempt to conquer Ukraine. Or so says Vladimir Putin. The reason is that his conquest has been justly defeated so far and he sees no other way forward. The prospect of such an escalation is appalling. A line would be crossed. Nuclear-armed powers round the world would regard it as a licence. It might not be the end of the world, but it might just be the beginning of the end. For all the cheerleading of western politicians over Putin’s humiliation, it is crucial to emphasise how disciplined has been the west’s support for Kyiv. Yes, Nato took a gamble in advancing its borders eastwards after 1991, George Kennan’s “most fateful error of the post-cold war era”. It taunted Russia’s paranoia and risked the emergence of a belligerent patriot, which is what happened in the case of Putin. But at no point has the west taken up arms against Russia, even when Russia successively attacked and “repatriated” areas of neighbouring Georgia, Chechnya and even Ukraine. Moscow’s spring invasion of Ukraine was on a wholly different scale from the 2014 intrusion into Donbas. It was so blatant and brutal that outside military support for Kyiv was as much humanitarian as strategic. But from the start, Nato did nothing to substantiate Moscow’s lie that the west had taken up arms against Russian territory. There were to be no long-range missiles, no bombers or western troops fighting on the ground. Only with economic sanctions did the west lend plausibility to Putin’s claim that it was attacking Russia itself. Putin has done his nation much harm. He has revealed his army as a Potemkin farce, his generals as incompetent sycophants. Many of his people, proud Russians long supportive of his bombast, are now openly hostile to his mobilisation. Polls show that a quarter to a half of Russians oppose the war. Only the spectacular discomfort caused to the west by Moscow’s retaliatory gas sanctions has afforded the Kremlin some respite. Otherwise Putin is bereft of options. Like many a commander forced into retreat, he is tormented by the choice of escalation or abject defeat. During the cold war, Europe’s civilians were taught how to respond to a potential thermonuclear exchange. The horror of “mutual assured destruction” was so ingrained it fed through into great-power diplomacy and created an infrastructure of back channels and accident aversion. The merest hint of danger, as during the Cuban crisis in 1962 and a radar malfunction in 1983, brought a swift return to sanity. There is no reason – or should be no reason – to see the present crisis as a return to the cold war and nuclear confrontation. Great powers are not in existential contention. Even Putin is threatening only tactical nuclear weapons. Given the weakness of his forces on the ground, it is hard to see what gain such weapons would bring him in what is a conventional infantry war over territory. They would be a gesture, and one that would surely lose him support both at home and abroad among his putative admirers in China and India. As for a nuclear “response” from the west, it would serve no tactical purpose and merely open the gates to escalation. We are told that if Putin was to fall, even “harder-line” figures within his circle would replace him. Russia is like all regimes under sanctions. Besieged elites drive opponents and moderates underground or into exile. They become entrenched and ever less vulnerable to diplomacy and economic pressure. Yet all wars must end. Russia’s in Ukraine has been going on for eight years and has increasingly taken on the colours of a proxy conflict of west against east. Therein lies the danger of Putin’s escalation. Western aid has enabled Ukraine to drive Russia’s troops back towards the 2014 frontiers. Ukraine and the west have been united in defying a brutal and authoritarian regime, and have been largely successful. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, now risks that unity by stating that he wants ever more western aid to drive Russia out of all of Ukraine, including Crimea. While his cause remains just, there must come a point when a war to conquer all of Ukraine becomes one of where to draw a line of armistice, as with Russia’s infringements of its neighbours’ sovereignty in Chechnya, Georgia, Crimea and Donbas. At some point, perhaps after one more forceful Ukrainian drive eastwards, there must come a different effort, to encourage the parties to agree a peace. Recent deals on wheat exports and prisoner exchanges show there are channels in place. That will mean a new challenge. The world of compromises, plebiscites, borders and guarantees may be less dramatic than that of guns, bombs, tanks and drums. But it has to be the world of the future. It has to presage the rebuilding of Ukraine. There is no conceivable interest in reviving the horrors of nuclear conflict between east and west just because one Russian ruler took leave of his senses.

The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said details would be announced soon. “What we’ll be doing in the coming weeks is outlining how we want to invest in the green jobs of the future, to bring bills down, to create a more sustainable energy supply,” he told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show. “We’ll be outlining that in a significant mission in the coming weeks, and we’ll be announcing more details then. “We know we’ve got to move to more renewable sources of energy. It’s important for our climate change commitments, but it’s also the way in which we can bring energy bills down for consumers. This isn’t about shutting down what’s going on now. We will manage those sustainably.” The proposals, which the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is expected to set out formally on a visit to Scotland next month, will involve not just a ban on new North Sea oil and gas licences, but a pledge that any borrowing for investment should be limited to green schemes. A party source said: “We are against the granting of new licences for oil and gas in the North Sea. They will do nothing to cut bills as the Tories have acknowledged; they undermine our energy security and would drive a coach and horse through our climate targets. “But Labour would continue to use existing oil and gas wells over the coming decades and manage them sustainably as we transform the UK into a clean energy superpower.” This will not stop drilling on projects that have already been approved, with the exception of the Rosebank and Cambo schemes, which Labour has said previously it would block. Asked if this would leave the country overreliant on wind power, Ashworth said: “It’s a mischaracterisation to say our policies all depend on wind. Yes, we need to invest in wind. We need to invest in tidal; we need to invest in nuclear. “We need more sustainable sources of energy supply in order to bring the bills down for consumers and actually create jobs in this green transition.” The aim, he said, should be for the UK to become a world leader in the green energy transition, and would create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, said Labour’s plans amounted to an “ideological vendetta against British energy independence” that would risk jobs and help Russia in using energy supplies as a weapon. The proposal is the latest in a series of Labour pledges over a move towards a greener economy, much of it pushed by Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change secretary. In 2021, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced the party would invest £28bn a year in climate crisis-related measures, covering not just green energy but also areas such as home insulation, active travel and flood defences. At last year’s Labour conference, Starmer said Labour would set up a publicly owned energy company run on clean UK power, to be known as Great British Energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/dec/02/labour-stays-on-course-for-power-with-chester-byelection-victory","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-02T09:54:51Z","webTitle":"Labour stays on course for power with Chester byelection victory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/dec/02/labour-stays-on-course-for-power-with-chester-byelection-victory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/dec/02/labour-stays-on-course-for-power-with-chester-byelection-victory","fields":{"bodyText":"For several months, nervous Labour MPs have looked at the national polls and asked themselves whether their commanding leads can really be trusted. On Thursday night, voters in Chester gave them, at least for now, an answer: yes. Thursday’s thumping byelection victory, with Labour winning its highest ever majority in the seat in a 14-point vote swing, suggests the party would win a comfortable majority if a general election were held today. It provides further evidence Labour is rebuilding support in the so-called red wall of northern seats, many of which it lost at the last election. Sir John Curtice, a professor of politics at Strathclyde University, told the BBC on Friday morning the result suggested the opposition party was heading for a “favourable” majority. “This is consistent with the claim that a) Labour are in a stronger position than they’ve ever been in the last 12 years; and b) the performance is consistent with what happened last time we had the defeat of a Conservative government,” he said. One Labour source said: “This is a phenomenal result for us, a landslide, bigger even than 1997 [when the party won 53% of the vote]. These are the kinds of seats we need to be winning if we are to show we are on course for a general election victory.” The seat is not the marginal it once was. In 2015, Labour won by just 93 votes, but the party won sizeable majorities at the two elections since. Nevertheless, the party went into the byelection against a difficult backdrop. The vote was called after Chris Matheson resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations. Labour officials said, however, that the controversy had not been a big issue on the doorstep, where voters were keener to talk about the economy, as well as more local issues such as Chester high street. Samantha Dixon, the new Labour MP, said during her acceptance speech that she had been greeted on the doorstep by one voter who was wrapped in blankets after her energy bills rose by hundreds of pounds. For the Conservatives, the result gives some tentative signs that the electorate is not as hostile to the party as it was in the final days of Liz Truss’s premiership, when Labour enjoyed national poll leads of more than 30 points. But if the party hoped Rishi Sunak’s leadership might help restore the voter coalition that propelled it to election victory in 2019, there is little sign of that. Andy Carter, the Tory MP for Warrington South, told the Telegraph on Thursday night: “We are mid-term in what has been an incredibly challenging parliamentary term on the back of Covid, a war in Ukraine where prices have shot up.” He added: “We’ve got two years until the next general election … I think [Rishi Sunak] has been in the job for five weeks doing a great job tackling inflation.” If Sunak wanted more time to be able to prove himself to voters, he will not get it. The parties will contest two more byelections in north-west England in the coming weeks. The first will be in Stretford and Urmston on 15 December, and the second on an unconfirmed date in West Lancashire. Some Conservative MPs believe, however, that the result in Chester shows the situation is unsalvageable for the new prime minister. Sir Charles Walker, the MP for Broxbourne, told Times Radio on Friday: “It’s almost impossible to see us coming back from this.” He added that the best Sunak could hope for at the next election would be to “win maybe 220 seats and form a viable opposition”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/19/life-in-occupied-ukrainian-nuclear-city-enerhodar-zaporizhzhia-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T12:08:17Z","webTitle":"‘Crazy things are happening’: life in occupied Ukrainian nuclear city ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/life-in-occupied-ukrainian-nuclear-city-enerhodar-zaporizhzhia-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/19/life-in-occupied-ukrainian-nuclear-city-enerhodar-zaporizhzhia-power-station","fields":{"bodyText":"I dedicated my life to nuclear power and have always been proud to be part of it. For many people like me, the Zaporizhzhia plant is our pride and destiny. There are six powerful units, about half of the capacity of all Ukrainian nuclear plants and a quarter of the country’s entire energy sector. Before the war, 11,000 people worked here. More than 50,000 people live in Enerhodar. We have been living under occupation for almost six months. It’s like a double occupation – the city and the nuclear plant have been captured. Our faith is constantly being tested. Ten days ago, we were sure that the city and the inhabitants would not suffer. But there are already wounded from the shelling at the station. There are already victims in the city. The station and the city are almost a single whole, because these are places where people work and live. The station continues its struggle for existence. It is full of Russian military vehicles and soldiers. Only two power units are in operation, not at full capacity. Salaries are being paid. Many employees work remotely. In the nuclear industry, we investigate any deviation in the operation of equipment or a mistake of personnel. Corrective actions have to be taken after that. Now such crazy things are happening at the station, such as the delivery of military equipment to the turbine halls of power units, damage to equipment as a result of shelling the station’s territory, and even, according to some information, the mining of the building. There were reports of people being kidnapped, including station workers. It’s hard to describe the feeling when you read about the kidnapping of a person you know personally. The situation changed dramatically 10 days ago, when the Russians began firing at the station and the outskirts of the city. They hit a high-voltage line, buildings on the station territory, and the spent nuclear fuel storage. The city was left without electricity for several hours. Since then, every day and every night we hear the roar of artillery salvos. Sometimes the Russians drive their artillery so close that it sounds like shooting in a neighbouring yard. Window glasses tremble. It feels like the whole house is shaking. Even those who do not believe in God pray for their salvation. Sometimes it happens in the middle of night. An ordinary person cannot distinguish the sounds of an artillery salvo and a shell burst. Therefore, every time it seems that this is an explosion and the next projectile will hit your house. We know that they are hitting the opposite bank of the Dnieper – the cities of Nikopol and Marganets. A few seconds after the first salvo, an alert is activated in Telegram channels – get to a shelter! Someone is trying to save people day and night. In the morning we read how many houses were destroyed and how many people were killed and injured. For many years these cities perceived our nuclear plant as a source of mortal danger. Now real death is flying from us to them. We can only commiserate with them. Enerhodar is a young city. We love and are proud of it. Now it seems to be seriously ill. Kindergartens and schools were closed immediately after the invasion. Although boys play basketball every day on the playground in front of the school, children’s voices on the street are heard less and less. This is a city of disappearing children. The occupying authorities, which I, fortunately, do not encounter, force people to write prices in hryvnias and rubles. I do not understand where the rubles come from here, except for those that were distributed to some pensioners. Maybe it’s an important part of their reports to Moscow. There is cold and hot water and electricity in the city. In this regard, we have always been under protection of the nuclear plant. Instead of three mobile operators, a Russian “no name” one appeared, using local equipment. Several internet providers have been restored but the traffic passes through Russia, with all Russian internet bans and limitations. Doctors at the hospital are receiving salaries but, as far as I know, there are huge problems with medicines. It is better not to get sick at this time. Here we also have the Zaporizhzhia thermal power plant, the largest in Ukraine. It was shut down due to damage to the railway bridge and the impossibility of delivering coal. All billboards in the city are used for Russian propaganda – covered in quotes from Putin and phrases about one people – Russian and Ukrainian. Before that, portraits of Soviet generals from the second world war and heroes of the Soviet Union hung there. People pass by indifferently. Russian flags hang over the city hall and elsewhere, although faded ones. People are leaving the city. I often notice that someone from my apartment block has not been seen for a long time. In any case, everyone is trying to send children and wives to the unoccupied territory or abroad. Two days ago, my neighbour could not stand it and evacuated his children. You can struggle against your own fear but it is impossible to fight fear in the eyes of your children. It is possible to exit the city, but just a week ago, at the checkpoint in Vasilievka, where the line of demarcation runs, there was a queue of thousands of cars from various occupied regions and people stood there for several days. Men stay. Most of them perceive work at the nuclear plant as their duty. Nuclear power workers in Ukraine are legally exempt from conscription, so it’s like their military service. But all the same, staff members are leaving, including operational ones. Despite everything, we continue to believe that all this will end soon. As long as we believe, the station continues to work, and the city continues to live."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/22/thursday-briefing-vladimir-putin-russia-nuclear-war-threat-truss-biden","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-22T05:36:23Z","webTitle":"Thursday briefing: How to make sense of Putin’s nuclear threats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/22/thursday-briefing-vladimir-putin-russia-nuclear-war-threat-truss-biden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/22/thursday-briefing-vladimir-putin-russia-nuclear-war-threat-truss-biden","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning. Threats of nuclear war from Vladimir Putin are never likely to go unnoticed, and the Russian president’s speech yesterday is all over the front pages of British newspapers this morning. Putin said that “when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal” and added “It’s not a bluff”. That led to condemnations from both Joe Biden and Liz Truss at the United Nations general assembly, with Truss saying at 2am UK time that the Russian president’s “bogus claims” were simply about “trying to justify his catastrophic failures”. But there were other aspects of Putin’s speech that could turn out to be more consequential, from the suggestion that occupied Ukraine will soon be part of Russia to an announcement that hundreds of thousands of reservists will now be called up to the military. So how should we view Putin’s threats and the west’s response – and what impact will new military service obligations have in Russia? For today’s newsletter, I asked the Guardian’s foreign correspondent Peter Beaumont and world affairs editor Julian Borger to explain how they’re thinking about the answers to those questions. That’s after the rest of the headlines.

In depth: ‘You can see how this could turn out to be his Vietnam’ *** Why did Putin make this speech yesterday? Ukrainian officials have been expecting an escalation for some time, said Peter Beaumont. “Even when I was last in Ukraine a couple of months ago, they thought it was on the cards.” But with winter approaching – and with it the prospect of a forced pause in aggressive operations – alongside disastrous recent news for Russia in Kharkiv, where Ukraine has rapidly taken back control of about 6,000 sq km, it finally came. News of the mobilisation of military reservists and references to nuclear weapons can hardly be read as good news for Ukraine or its allies – but it does suggest “an awareness that actually the Kremlin can’t keep pretending things are going well in the ‘special operation’,” Peter said. As Keir Giles, a fellow of the Chatham House Russia and Eurasia programme, wrote in the Guardian yesterday: “The speech is a further recognition that Russia has been unable to win on the battlefield – so, to defeat Ukraine, it has to win elsewhere.” *** What does Putin want to achieve? While the most obviously alarming feature of Putin’s speech was his reference to nuclear weapons, it has to be understood through a subtler aspect of what he said: references to Russian “territorial integrity” and a new emphasis on attempts to frame his invasion as a defensive operation. The speech coincided with an announcement that four Russian-occupied regions will hold referendums this weekend on joining the Russian Federation – widely viewed as a sham pretext for annexation. “You cannot separate the two,” Peter said. “By claiming he is fighting a defensive war, Putin is trying to set the stage for annexing these regions, ‘freezing’ the conflict, and then declaring that they are now part of Russia and under the nuclear umbrella.” That is unlikely to persuade Ukraine to simply give up. “After all, they’ve already attacked Crimea, which is annexed Russia territory,” Peter said. Instead, “Putin wants the more cautious nations in the western coalition to think: ‘Are we going to be made to go too far?’ But I’m not sure that’s going to work. So far it appears to have just reinforced the view that this is a rogue regime.” *** How did Biden and Truss respond to the nuclear threat? Initially, at least, it doesn’t look as if saying “it’s not a bluff” has been as slam-dunk a proof of authenticity as Putin appears to have hoped. “It is a consequential thing, to talk about a nuclear attack, and you should never treat it as absurd,” said Peter. “But on balance you do have to think about it as a bluff, whatever he says. I don’t have that view of Putin as mad: he has acknowledged before that nuclear war is unthinkable and unfightable. And the Kremlin knows that any kind of nuclear escalation” – like exploding a warhead over the Black Sea – “would mean that the rest of the world, including China, saw this conflict in the west’s terms, not Russia’s terms.” That’s the context for Liz Truss’s and Joe Biden’s speeches at the United Nations general assembly, which acknowledged the gravity of Putin’s speech – but also insisted that his nuclear threats would not cause any rift. Truss accused Putin of “doubling down” but accused him of “sabre-rattling threats” and concluded: “This will not work.” Biden said Putin’s “overt nuclear threats against Europe” showed “a reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the non-proliferation regime.” “It’s a delicate balance,” said Julian Borger, the Guardian’s world affairs editor, speaking after Truss’ speech this morning. “And those were the briefings from the US – that we’re not going to be deterred, but we can see the dynamics of escalation and we’re not going to overplay our hand. The thinking is that they need to continue to lay down their own lines for what is acceptable and what is not, and ignore Putin’s – not to reward him for his sabre-rattling.” In practice, what that means is maintaining that an attack on Russian territory by Ukraine would not have western support – but that Putin’s attempt to define parts of Ukraine as Russian via sham referendums will not be accepted. *** How will it be received in Russia? While nuclear threats are bound to preoccupy western audiences, the announcement of a partial mobilisation is likely to have more impact at home. Bringing a new 300,000 troops into the conflict might sound ominous, but “it doesn’t actually make a huge amount of sense”, said Peter. “The most useful part is ensuring that contracted soldiers who had been planning to leave the military after six months stay in the campaign. And there’s a view that you can use these mobilised forces to take on jobs that combat soldiers are doing, and sharpen your capability on the frontlines. But it seems pretty fanciful to think they can easily absorb this many troops.” Ed Arnold, of the thinktank Rusi, tells Dan Sabbagh in this piece that “operationally, this won’t make any difference this year and probably not into next year ... the infrastructure isn’t there in terms of equipping that level of force at the moment.” Meanwhile, Peter said, the announcement “immediately creates a class of people whose view of the war is suddenly a lot more personal than it was before”. That is not likely to lead to outright rebellion, Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Moscow Center says in this piece by Pjotr Sauer about the domestic reaction. “Russia’s repressed society will accept this obediently,” he said. “They will deal with the issue in their own practical way, avoiding the draft however they can.” But in the hours after Putin’s speech, more than 1,300 people had been arrested during anti-war protests in dozens of cities, according to the independent OVD-Info protest monitoring group. Another immediate index of that impact: direct flights to countries allowing Russians visa-free entry were sold-out on Wednesday morning, while searches for phrases like “how to break your arm” and “how to avoid the draft” rocketed. In this piece, Andrew Roth hears from some of the dismayed Russians who could be affected by the draft, one of whom says: “I’d rather leave than fight in this war.” “I don’t like predicting things,” Peter said. “So this is only a possibility. But when you think of 300,000 troops being recruited who would plainly rather be doing anything else, you can see how this could turn out to be his Vietnam.” What else we’ve been reading Zoe Williams compellingly lays out the case for marriage sabbaticals.

The new UK prime minister, who addressed the UN in New York hours after a virtual speech by the Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged world leaders not to “let up” on dealing with Putin despite domestic concerns about soaring energy prices. “For the first time in the history of this assembly we are meeting during a large-scale war of aggression in Europe,” she said. “And authoritarian states are undermining stability and security around the world. Geopolitics is entering a new era – one that requires those who believe in the founding principles of the United Nations to stand up and be counted.” She said of the Russian president’s speech: “This morning we have seen Putin trying to justify his catastrophic failures. He is doubling down by sending even more reservists to a terrible fate. He is desperately trying to claim the mantle of democracy for a regime without human rights or freedoms. And he is making yet more bogus claims and sabre-rattling threats. This will not work.” Truss also used her address to highlight the continuing struggle, with economic security at its heart, between democracies and autocracies. “Unless democratic societies deliver on the economy and security our citizens expect, we will fall behind,” she said. “We need to keep improving and renewing what we do for the new era, demonstrating that democracy delivers.” The British prime minister also vowed to “sustain or increase our military support to Ukraine, for as long as it takes”. Earlier, in a joint statement with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, Truss added that the Russian military mobilisation, with 300,000 reservists to be called up as the Kremlin attempts to regain ground in the face of a counterattack by Ukraine’s forces, was “a statement of weakness”. The foreign secretary, James Cleverly, will face his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov at a meeting of the UN security council on Thursday, where he will set out how Russian forces continue to violate international law, and expose how Moscow plans to fix the results of sham referendums in occupied territories. He is expected to say: “We can and must make clear to President Putin that his attacks on the sovereign will of the Ukrainian people – so clearly expressed as they fight for their homes – must stop. His assaults on the UN charter and international norms that protect us will not be tolerated and he must withdraw from Ukraine to enable a return to regional and global stability.” As foreign secretary, Truss travelled to Moscow to meet Lavrov in February, just weeks before the invasion of Ukraine, but relations were icy with Russia’s top diplomat describing the talks as a conversation of “the mute with the deaf”, as she warned Moscow of tough sanctions in the event of an attack on Ukraine. British officials are treating Putin’s threat of using nuclear weapons very seriously, both in terms of defence, but also as another example of Russia flouting international agreements. Yet they are ruling out engaging in a battle of words with the Russian president, who they believe is under growing pressure at home after attempting to mobilise reservists who have been trying to get to airports across Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/22/sizewell-c-may-cost-double-government-estimates-and-take-five-years-longer-to-build","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-22T09:56:46Z","webTitle":"Sizewell C ‘may cost double government estimates and take five years longer to build’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/22/sizewell-c-may-cost-double-government-estimates-and-take-five-years-longer-to-build","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/22/sizewell-c-may-cost-double-government-estimates-and-take-five-years-longer-to-build","fields":{"bodyText":"The proposed Sizewell C nuclear power station could cost UK taxpayers more than double government estimates and take an extra five years to build, according to research. Ministers will decide in July whether to approve the development of the Suffolk power station proposed by the French developer EDF. The business department has estimated that the government-backed scheme will add an extra £1 a month to household bills to aid construction costs. But research by the University of Greenwich Business School seen by the Guardian shows the average monthly cost could reach £2.12, or £25.40 a year. At its costliest point, the build could cost taxpayers nearly £4 a month. That represents the study’s gloomiest forecast, which predicts construction would take 17 years and cost £43.8bn. The project had been expected to cost £20bn and take 10-12 years to build. Stephen Thomas, a professor at Greenwich Business School, said the average forecast put the cost at £35bn over 15 years, or £2.3bn a year. The figures could further inflame the debate over the cost and time of building power stations after Boris Johnson last month set a target of building a new nuclear station every year. EDF admitted last week that Hinkley Point C, the power station it is developing in Somerset, would cost an extra £3bn, taking it to up to £26bn. The already delayed project will take an extra year, and is expected to begin generating electricity in June 2027. EDF had originally planned for it be operational by Christmas 2017. The French firm said consumers would not be hit by the extra costs at Hinkley Point C, which will be taken on by EDF and China’s CGN, its junior partner in the project. However, at Sizewell C the government has already committed £100m to the project and plans to use a regulated asset base (RAB) funding model. RAB funding gives investors a set return during the construction phase of a project, reducing their risk and making an asset more attractive to outside investors. However, it shifts the risk of delays and extra costs on to taxpayers. The government argues that the RAB model could reduce the project cost of a nuclear power station by more than £30bn over its 60-year lifespan. The model was used in the construction of Heathrow Terminal 5 and the Thames Tideway super-sewer. A final decision on plans for Sizewell C was recently pushed back from 25 May to 8 July. The site is located north of EDF’s existing Sizewell B plant. Campaigners argue that the development would be costly and threatens the local environment. The prospect of extra costs comes as consumers face soaring bills amid the energy crisis. The government has been urged to intervene with annual bills forecast to balloon to nearly £3,000 from October. Johnson has thrown his weight behind nuclear power as a green option to boost Britain’s energy security in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and as he targets net zero emissions by 2050. Thomas said: “It may not seem a huge amount extra on bills but several of these projects will overlap, meaning consumers paying even more for a long time. If costs are even higher than expected, it could become a real burden.” A spokesperson for Sizewell C said: “The RAB model is a tried and tested financing arrangement, which has already been used to raise funds for more than £160bn of UK infrastructure. Applied to Sizewell C, it will bring the cost of finance down and deliver significant savings to consumers.” A government spokesperson said: “We firmly stand by our assessment that a large-scale project funded under our Nuclear Act would add at most a few pounds a year to typical household energy bills during the early stages of construction, and on average about £1 a month during the full construction phase of the project.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/jun/06/lord-deben-backs-labours-plan-to-halt-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-drilling","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-06T05:00:02Z","webTitle":"Lord Deben backs Labour’s plan to halt new North Sea oil and gas drilling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/06/lord-deben-backs-labours-plan-to-halt-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-drilling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/jun/06/lord-deben-backs-labours-plan-to-halt-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-drilling","fields":{"bodyText":"The UK’s most senior climate adviser has strongly endorsed Labour’s vow to halt new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea, and slammed the government for failing to show leadership on the issue. John Gummer, who as Lord Deben chairs the statutory committee on climate change, told the Guardian he approved of Labour’s commitment. “I welcome this policy, I am absolutely in favour and it is the right thing to do,” he said. “I’m sorry this is not a common view to all parties,” he added. Gummer, a former Conservative environment secretary in the 1990s, blasted ministers who have attacked Labour’s proposals. He pointed out that the government’s support for new oil and gas exploration ran counter to its stance at international climate negotiations, now taking place in Bonn. “I don’t understand how the government can ask other people not to produce more oil [while supporting new oil and gas licences in the North Sea]. That’s exactly what they are doing now – asking other people not to do what they’re doing,” he said. Labour has come under fire over its stance on the North Sea, from the government as well as its own supporters. Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, used social media to lambast Keir Starmer, charging him with committing to higher energy bills. The GMB union also attacked Starmer after he last week reaffirmed a commitment made earlier this year to halt the drilling of new oil and gas wells in the North Sea. Gary Smith, leader of the GMB Union, claimed it was “naive” and would cost jobs. But Starmer has strongly defended his decision, which along with commitments to green jobs, new nuclear power and renewable energy will form the centrepiece of a policy statement to be made in Scotland later this month. Gummer told the Guardian that leaders across the political spectrum should follow Labour’s lead. “This should be the common view of all parties,” he said. He said it was “nonsense” to claim that new oil and gas fields would reduce energy bills. “These are new oilfields that will not come on stream for another 10 or 20 years. And when they do, the oil and gas will be sold to the highest bidder. So it will not reduce prices in the UK. The only way you could make them reduce bills here would be to nationalise them.” He said fears over jobs at risk in the North Sea were also unfounded. He said the UK should continue to produce gas from existing fields in the short term, but future jobs would be in green industries. “I’m in favour of producing more gas now, we need it owing to what Putin has done, but we are not talking about that – we are talking about new oilfields that would not come on stream for many years,” he said. “There are vast numbers of jobs to be had in offshore and onshore wind, in solar PV, which are all much cheaper than using oil. The jobs are all there in green industries – these are new jobs, the oil jobs are old jobs. Trade unions should be supporting new job creation.” Gummer said he also favoured building new nuclear power stations, which Starmer has also pledged to support. Before his ennoblement as Lord Deben, Gummer was a long-serving Conservative MP and former environment secretary and minister, under Margaret Thatcher and John Major. He is due to leave his CCC post later this month, and a successor has not yet been named. International negotiations are taking place in Bonn this week and next over how to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. But the government would not confirm to the Guardian whether any ministers will attend. Gummer said a halt to new oil and gas exploration was essential to keep the global climate livable. “Climate change will mean we will not be able to live as we do now, in the very near future. It’s urgent, it has to be dealt with, and we cannot ignore it,” he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “In line with our net zero 2050 commitment, we will not shy away from awarding new licences where they are justified, and where they can benefit Britain. While our plans to power up Britain include significant investment in new renewable and nuclear projects, the transition to non-fossil forms of energy cannot happen overnight and even when we’re net zero, we will still need some oil and gas, as recognised by the independent CCC.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jan/04/nsw-coal-power-stations-set-to-receive-500m-in-price-cap-compensation","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-04T01:42:39Z","webTitle":"NSW coal power stations set to receive $500m in price-cap compensation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/04/nsw-coal-power-stations-set-to-receive-500m-in-price-cap-compensation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jan/04/nsw-coal-power-stations-set-to-receive-500m-in-price-cap-compensation","fields":{"bodyText":"Coal power stations in New South Wales are set to receive $500m in price-cap compensation, according to state government sources, further fuelling fears payouts are nearing $1bn. The compensation figure for NSW’s power producers comes on top of an estimate of up to $450m for Queensland’s Gladstone plant, a figure the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, disputed in December before the state’s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, appeared to contradict him. In December the Albanese government legislated a temporary price cap of $12 a gigajoule for gas and $125 a tonne for coal, as part of a package including $1.5bn in electricity price relief to save households about $230 on their power bills. To encourage continued supply, where coal power producers have actual costs exceeding the $125 price cap – such as pre-existing supply contracts for more expensive coal – the federal and state governments agreed to provide them a rebate. On Wednesday the Australian reported, and Guardian Australia has confirmed, that according to NSW government sources the figure for that state’s coal power producers will be about $500m. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Recipients would include Australia’s biggest generator, the Origin-owned Eraring power station to Newcastle’s south, along with coal stations at Bayswater, Liddell, Mount Piper and Vales Point B. A spokesperson for the federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, said “details of the financial assistance are currently being finalised with the NSW government”. The spokesperson said rebates were only offered where pre-existing contracts for coal are above $125 a tonne or in the “very rare circumstances in which reasonable cost of production exceeds $125 a tonne”. “These actions are necessary to shield Australian households and businesses from the worst of the energy price spikes and ensure power prices are as low as possible.” Last month a Queensland government source told Guardian Australia the $450m payout figure for Rio Tinto and its Gladstone power station partners would be “in the ballpark”, although state generators returning in May should limit compensation to six months. The $450m price tag prompted a backlash from the Greens, with their leader, Adam Bandt, saying “not a single dollar of public money” should go to coal and gas corporations, and from the independent senator David Pocock, who said it “raises serious concerns about the total amount of compensation to be paid”. “The briefings and information I received suggested that any compensation under this plan to bring much-needed energy price relief for households and small businesses would be minimal and confined to a small number of generators,” Pocock said. Asked about the reported Gladstone payout, Albanese said: “No, those reports are just that, they are reports … We expect that [for Gladstone] it will be nothing like the sort of figures that I’ve seen in the newspaper.” But Palaszczuk appeared to confirm the figure was possible as a maximum, responding “yes, we did know” compensation for Gladstone could be “up to $450m”. “All of that was worked out when we reached the agreement we reached,” she told reporters. Federal government sources last month said they still expected the total price of compensation to be between $500m and $1bn, figures Guardian Australia reported in mid-December based on a Treasury briefing that included estimates of $250m for NSW producers. The rate of compensation is being determined by a reconciliation of electricity producers’ actual costs with the $125 cap, made more difficult by the fact costs can vary with a combination of coal at a pre-contracted price or from the spot market."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-453-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T14:01:37Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 453 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-453-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-453-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Fighting has broken out along the Russian border with Ukraine after self-described Russian partisan forces launched a cross-border raid and claimed to have overrun a border settlement for the first time in the war. The Freedom of Russia Legion, which describes itself as an anti-Kremlin militia seeking to overthrow the Kremlin and liberate Russia from Vladimir Putin, claimed to have crossed the border and overrun the settlement of Kozinka, while sending units into the town of Grayvoron in Russia’s Belgorod region. Any capture of territory in Belgorod has not been independently confirmed by journalists on the ground. The militia has mostly existed on social media and it is not known to have participated in any major battles during the war. But both Russia and Ukrainian officials have confirmed fighting at the border and social media video has shown armoured vehicles appearing to overrun a Russian border post near Grayvoron. The Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said that Russian forces have begun demining operations in Bakhmut. Tass quotes him appearing on the Rossiya-24 TV channel and saying: “There is a preliminary demining of the city. It is important for us to carry out a complete, thorough demining. This is a very painstaking and difficult work, given the scale of the hostilities that took place there.” In another report, Tass quotes a source from the local Russian-imposed officials saying that “a few dozen more residents” remained in Bakhmut, but that “perhaps, the figure will change as the basements of houses are examined”. The source said that the “evacuation” of civilians continues. Ukrainian troops are still advancing on the flanks of the devastated city, although the “intensity” of their movement has decreased and Russia is bringing in more forces, Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Monday. She said that Ukraine had a small foothold inside the city itself, again denying Russia’s assertion that it has established full control over Bakhmut. Russian president Vladimir Putin congratulated Wagner and Russian regular forces on “the completion of the operation to liberate Artemovsk [the city’s Soviet-era name]” after Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin posed among the wreckage, and said his mercenary group controlled the entire city at the weekend. It has not been possible for journalists to verify the battlefield situation in the city for months. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been reconnected to the electricity grid after it was switched to standby and emergency power supply generators were used. Russia-installed local official in the Moscow-controlled part of the region Vladimir Rogov said the plant was “completely” disconnected from external power supply after Ukraine disconnected a power line it controls, Reuters reports. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine, but Anatoliy Kurtev, Zaporizhzhia city council’s secretary in Ukraine, said that work was ongoing since early Monday to restore power to the city. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has said the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) “cannot continue”. The Washington Post is reporting that the UN nuclear watchdog is pushing for a last-minute agreement to safeguard Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant ahead of any counteroffensive. At least eight people were wounded and scores of buildings were damaged in a Russian air attack on Dnipropetrovsk region. “The Russian invaders attacked military and infrastructure facilities of the eastern outpost of Ukraine – the city of Dnipro,” Ukraine’s air force said on the Telegram messaging service. “The attack was carried out by 16 different types of missiles and 20 Shahed-136/131 strike drones,” the air force said, adding that air defences brought down 20 Russian drones and four cruise missiles. At least one person was injured, and images from the city show destruction of emergency services equipment in what appears to have been a strike on a fire station. Russia’s ambassador to the US appears to have warned Washington that any strike on Crimea could be considered a strike on Russian territory by Nato after US president Joe Biden said he would support training for Ukrainian pilots on US F-16 fighter jets. In remarks published on the embassy’s Telegram channel, Anatoly Antonov wrote: “I would like to warn representatives of the administration against thoughtless judgments on Crimea, especially in terms of ‘blessing’ the Kyiv regime for air attacks on the peninsula. Let me remind you that strikes on this territory are considered by us as an attack on any other region of the Russian Federation. It is important that the United States is fully aware of the Russian response.” Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of president of Ukraine, has said “Crimea is an indisputable and inseparable part of Ukraine. It was, it is and it will be. The liberation of Crimea using any military force and means is the only rational way to stop ‘Russian aggressions’ and bring the world back to international law. It is Ukraine’s direct obligation and necessity today” The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region has claimed on Telegram that an explosive device dropped from an unmanned aerial vehicle in Novaya Tavolzhanka, without causing any injuries. The governor of Russia’s Bryansk region has claimed this morning that Ukraine has shelled a village. The EU’s top diplomat will propose further sanctions against Russia, following a promise by G7 leaders to intensify western restrictions on Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said he hoped to soon present “concrete proposals to implement the decision of the G7 on new kinds of sanctions against Russia”. Zelenskiy secured fresh military aid from the US during a day of frantic diplomatic activity at the G7 summit at the weekend. US president Joe Biden announced military assistance worth up to $375m (£300m) to Kyiv, telling Zelenskiy the US was doing everything possible to strengthen Ukraine’s defence. The package includes ammunition, artillery, armoured vehicles and training. Biden told a press conference that he had received a “flat assurance” from Zelenskiy that he would not use western-provided F-16 fighter jets to go into Russian territory. Biden said F-16 warplanes could, however, be used “wherever Russian troops are within Ukraine and the area”. Biden told G7 leaders that Washington supports joint allied training programs for Ukrainian pilots on F-16s warplanes, although Kyiv has not won specific, public commitments for delivery of the fighter jets. In a G7 speech, Zelenskiy said Kyiv’s plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine was “an obvious expression of rationality”, and sought support for his “peace formula”. He thanked western leaders for achieving “a level of cooperation which ensures that democracy, international law, and freedom are respected”, but questioned: “Is this enough?” Zelenskiy played down the fact he did not meet Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on the sidelines of the summit, saying it was likely because of scheduling. Lula has said Zelenskiy and Putin bear equal responsibility for the war and accused western powers of encouraging the conflict. Berlin police have opened an investigation into the suspected poisoning of two Russian journalists visiting the city for a conference last month organised by the Russian Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The probe comes after Russian investigative media group Agentsvo wrote that the two women had reported symptoms that pointed to possible poisoning around the time of the event at the end of April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/jan/15/natalie-murray-beale-conductor-prepared-cate-blanchett-for-tar","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-15T12:00:13Z","webTitle":"Power behind the baton: the conductor who prepared Cate Blanchett for Tár ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/15/natalie-murray-beale-conductor-prepared-cate-blanchett-for-tar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/jan/15/natalie-murray-beale-conductor-prepared-cate-blanchett-for-tar","fields":{"bodyText":"Cate Blanchett’s new film role as an imposing orchestral conductor is earning her a shot at another top acting award. But it has already given the Oscar-winner the skills to lead a real orchestra through a score. The actor, who plays fictional American conductor Lydia Tár in the film, Tár, mastered the complexities of the job by training with Natalie Murray Beale, an established star in the field who lives in London and who spent weeks coaching Blanchett for the part. Murray Beale, the hidden force behind the powerful performance, supervised the orchestral scenes after guiding Blanchett during rehearsals. “Cate can conduct now, if she wants,” Murray Beale told the Observer. “She is very musical, sings beautifully and now she has the tools to conduct. I suggested she learn the musical lines of the pieces by heart, rather than learning the score or copying another performance.” Murray Beale, 46, conducts opera, concerts and film scores and, like Blanchett, is Australian. “We developed her own style, but she’s an actress who changes all the time and we didn’t want it to be fixed, since at that level of conducting there is no strict, standard way to do it. A top orchestra is virtuosic, so you don’t need to do all the basics; you can express yourself more. We looked a lot at the physical aspects, ensuring she would not be too reverent of the conductor’s podium, because after all it’s just her workplace.” Some early audiences have protested about director Todd Field’s portrayal of a manipulative and selfish woman in a rare position of authority, but the musicianship and the examination of toxic power have convinced many who work in classical music. “I’m delighted that colleagues say it is authentic,” said Murray Beale. “We went into great detail on the psychology of conducting. These abusive behaviours do still exist. There are not many places where a boss has such power. A conductor is a gatekeeper. I have witnessed anger in rehearsal and even a tussle between conductor and musician. It’s a highly competitive field.” As a young conservatoire student in Australia, Murray Beale herself was affected. “I experienced inappropriate behaviour from a teacher, which I reported. And yet the person concerned was protected. It’s very difficult for institutions because they don’t want things to reflect badly on them.” The conductor believes “the old boys’ club” has been broken down “to some extent”. “There is much more diversity now and the musicians have much more voice. That is a significant, positive change.” Field’s decision to cast a woman in the role of an abusive “maestro”, she argues, allows audiences to see the problem “with fresh eyes”. Whatever cinemagoers decide about the treatment of the subject, Murray Beale adds, there is an overriding value to showing a woman as a highly skilled, admired musician. “It’s very easy for people to have a strong personal reaction to this film, but for me the lack of visibility for female conductors is the real problem. So it was exciting to realise this film will be seen all over the world, particularly in places where women are never shown in such authoritative roles.” One of the hardest elements of conducting is the task of absorbing all the musical material, but for Blanchett, Murray Beale suspects, the most difficult moment was her first encounter with the full orchestra in Dresden, Germany, where the film was largely shot. “Because of the lockdowns we hadn’t had much practice with that. Luckily, we were able to have some rehearsals. I said to Cate, ‘Just don’t be apologetic,’ and she developed a fantastic rapport. Whenever the musicians were drained and fatigued, she was able to flip the atmosphere by making them laugh.” And Murray Beale soon detected a helpful, unexpected parallel between the plot of the film and the musical work of a conductor. “You need to create a lot of tension as a conductor, building up the sense in a concert piece that at some point it all has to break. I think this screenplay, and particularly the way the film has been edited, are just like that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/04/power-struggles-companies-winter-blackouts-uk-generators","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-04T13:40:56Z","webTitle":"Power struggles: UK companies gear up for winter blackouts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/04/power-struggles-companies-winter-blackouts-uk-generators","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/04/power-struggles-companies-winter-blackouts-uk-generators","fields":{"bodyText":"In nearly 40 years as a shopkeeper, James Daunt has had to deal with power cuts many times. “Sometimes there’s a flood or a huge JCB digger has gone through your power supply,” says the founder of Daunt Books, and managing director of Waterstones. “You might run the power from the guy next door, or sometimes you’re literally going round with a torch collecting books for customers in the gloom.” But this winter could present a very different challenge. If gas supplies run too low, the government has crisis plans for a series of rolling three-hour power cuts, with regions of the UK taking it in turn to go dark. This week, the Guardian revealed that officials have also dusted down Programme Yarrow, which would kick in if there were a complete nationwide blackout. It involves prioritising food, water and shelter for the young and for older people, and examines how to communicate with the public. Only hospitals, oil refineries and certain other critical services would be protected. One of the last big power cuts, in August 2019, hit a million customers’ electricity supplies, and caused chaos for rail, road and air commuters. Shop tills froze, IT systems crashed and factories shut down. Thousands of bosses across the country are working out how to prepare their businesses for the worst-case scenarios. In retail, ensuring that stores can still trade is prioritised. Waterstones’ till systems are backed up with uninterruptible power supply (UPS) units, which can work offline. “When the power comes back, all the money flows through,” says Daunt. “The UPS units cannot provide enough power for adequate lighting but you carry on in the gloom – customers are very tolerant of it.” At other shops without these backups, transactions become near impossible in an increasingly cashless economy. As the threatened three-hour blackouts are designed to be evenly spread across the country, Daunt believes that it could be “swings and roundabouts” for his 300 stores nationwide, depending on where and when the cuts fall. For supermarkets – with huge supply chains, chillers and lighting requirements – energy is a huge resource. Sainsbury’s this week said it can control ventilation and lighting in stores and can be “very agile” in responding to issues, although it is not stocking up on generators for each store. Waitrose says the “vast majority of our main buildings have secondary power supplies”. Iceland’s boss, Richard Walker, says the retailer is “in the process of mapping out our future energy requirements” and is installing solar panels at its shops and warehouses. He concedes, however, that nationwide blackouts would make it difficult to keep shops open. In the City, where lost trading time could cost millions of pounds, catastrophe protocols are being studied. Banks in London may use locations beyond the Square Mile, mainly in Essex and Surrey, which were called upon in the pandemic. JPMorgan has said it has contingency plans for all its locations, and can even move staff between offices in different countries. The trade body UK Finance says firms are “making sure their ducks are in a row” and studying precedents in markets such as South Africa, where power cuts are commonplace. Typically, City firms have at least 72 hours of backup generator power, as well as on-site engineers. Industries where being efficient with time is crucial are particularly exposed to power cuts. A senior newspaper executive says it has a “Mary Celeste-style” empty office far from its central London newsroom to ensure it can continue to publish in an emergency on tight deadlines. The site has capacity for about 30 core editors and production staff. “The office is meant to be used in the case of some form of disaster. It has a backup generator, which is tested regularly,” he says. “Improvements in technology allowing people to work from home have made it slightly less important – the key is to have remote access to your core system and protect your server.” Home working will be reliant on robust telecoms, but this is an industry used to outages, typically caused by problems such as storms, and falling trees hitting overhead lines. BT operates 6,000 UK exchanges, each of which has a backup generator. Simon Lowth, BT’s chief financial officer, said this week it has held talks with the government about potentially using the generators for wider public use “to help cope with demand at peaks”. Its ubiquitous green cabinets, seen on Britain’s street corners, which provide broadband connections, have four hours of backup power. The British Gas owner Centrica advises businesses that, rather than protect an entire site from electricity loss at huge cost, they should prioritise essential systems. Certain industries simply cannot function in darkness: blackouts in the West End in 2016 forced performances to be scrapped at some of the country’s best known venues. Some consumers have begun contingency planning. Demand for airfryers, electric blankets and energy monitors had already soared as shoppers sought to cut bills. Now, Google Trends data shows a sharp increase in searches for portable power packs and torches. The slightly apocalyptic scenario has also piqued the interest of survivalists, or “preppers”, who proactively prepare for emergencies. A Reddit discussion among preppers on the prospect of UK blackouts shows users encouraging each other to buy bio-ethanol fires, USB-powered electric blankets, dry pre-packaged meals, water filters and plumbing supplies in case pipes freeze. One senior energy executive says: “The more remote your house is, or the more essential a service your business provides, the more robust your plans for power loss should be.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2023/may/12/landlords-to-be-given-more-powers-to-evict-tenants-for-antisocial-behaviour","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-12T05:00:45Z","webTitle":"Landlords to be given more powers to evict tenants for antisocial behaviour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/12/landlords-to-be-given-more-powers-to-evict-tenants-for-antisocial-behaviour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/may/12/landlords-to-be-given-more-powers-to-evict-tenants-for-antisocial-behaviour","fields":{"bodyText":"Landlords in England will be able to evict tenants for antisocial behaviour more easily as part of a wider package of reforms to the rental market, after heavy lobbying by industry organisations and Conservative backbenchers. Michael Gove will use the renters’ reform bill, which could be introduced to the Commons as soon as next week, to strengthen landlords’ rights when it comes to dealing with alleged antisocial behaviour. The move is designed both to reduce antisocial behaviour and to allay landlords’ concerns as the housing secretary also prepares to bring an end to “no-fault” evictions. But charities warn it could also harm victims of domestic abuse, who are often accused mistakenly by neighbours of antisocial behaviour because of the violence happening within their homes. Deidre Cartwright, the senior housing manager at Standing Together Against Domestic Abuse, said: “We welcome the fact that no-fault eviction is ending. But the worry is that by expanding the grounds for landlords to evict people for antisocial behaviour, the government is creating a back door for landlords who otherwise would have used the no-fault route.” A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “We will bring forward legislation very shortly, which will include a ban on no-fault evictions, so that all tenants have greater security in their homes and are empowered to challenge poor conditions.” The centrepiece of the bill will be a ban on property owners evicting tenants without showing any fault on the tenants’ part, something some landlords do as a way to put up rents before a contract ends. The ban fulfils a manifesto commitment the Conservatives made in 2019 and is part of a push by Gove to refocus Tory housing policy on renters and leaseholders in part to win back young urban voters who have deserted the party in their millions. He is already having to water down parts of that move, however. The Guardian revealed on Wednesday he had been forced to drop plans to end leaseholds altogether after Downing Street warned it could not be accomplished before the election. In recent weeks, Gove has also come under heavy pressure to change the rental proposals as well, with Tory MPs and landlord organisations calling for the bill to give landlords more rights. In recent weeks ministers have met MPs on the Property Research Group, a group of Tory MPs formed to fight against property tax, but which also contains several landlords. The group was set up by Kevin Hollinrake, a business minister who co-founded Hunters estate agents and owns five properties from which he collects rent. They have also been lobbied by the National Residential Landlords Association, which has campaigned for greater landlord rights in a number of areas, including antisocial behaviour. Ben Beadle, the chief executive of the NRLA, said: “We want to see an announcement that gives responsible landlords the confidence that they can evict tenants for things such as rent arrears or antisocial behaviour.” Government sources say Gove has agreed that it should be easier for landlords to evict tenants on antisocial behaviour grounds, though they deny this is as a result of the lobbying he has come under. One said: “The idea this is a sop to landlords is absurd.” Many of the proposals that will be included in the bill when it is introduced to the Commons featured in Rishi Sunak’s antisocial behaviour action plan, which the prime minister published earlier this year. They include expanding the definition of antisocial behaviour to include “any behaviour capable of causing nuisance or annoyance”, and making it easier for landlords to prove such behaviour in court. Some are concerned, however, that the measures could tilt the balance of power too far towards landlords. Natalie Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover, said: “We will need to see the detail of these proposals, but we do not want to see landlords being able to claim that tenants are being antisocial simply because they make complaints about them or their properties.” The concerns around domestic abuse, meanwhile, stem from the fact that domestic abuse victims are four times more likely to have antisocial behaviour complaints made against them, often because neighbours simply misunderstand what is happening inside a household."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/25/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-disconnected-ukraine-grid-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-25T18:26:41Z","webTitle":"Shelling temporarily disconnects Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from Ukraine grid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/25/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-disconnected-ukraine-grid-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/25/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-disconnected-ukraine-grid-russia","fields":{"bodyText":"Fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Thursday, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation, the country’s nuclear power firm, Energoatom, has said. There have been growing international concerns about safety at Europe’s largest nuclear plant. It has been occupied by Russian forces since the start of the war, and they are now using it to house military vehicles and equipment. The White House called on Russia to agree to a demilitarised zone around the plant, after the US president, Joe Biden, spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Biden congratulated him on the country’s 31st Independence Day, celebrated on Wednesday, which was also the six-month mark since Russia invaded. “I know it is a bittersweet anniversary, but I made it clear that the United States would continue to support Ukraine and its people as they fight to defend their sovereignty,” Biden tweeted after the phone call. Negotiations are under way for the UN’s nuclear watchdog to visit the site, and Ukraine’s top nuclear official told the Guardian that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors could arrive by the end of the month. Until then, continued fighting puts the plant, and potentially much of Europe, at risk. A nuclear accident could spread radiation far across the continent. The plant was disconnected twice from the Ukrainian grid on Thursday after a blaze at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plant affected the fourth and last connection into the plant’s reactors. Three other lines had already been taken out during the war. “The actions of the invaders caused a complete disconnection of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid – for the first time in the history of the plant,” Energoatom said on Thursday. The severing of that connection briefly caused a blackout in the Zaporizhzhia region, said Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-appointed governor for the area. Power has now been restored. Disconnecting the plant from the grid is dangerous because it raises the risk of catastrophic failure of the electricity-run cooling systems for its reactors and spent fuel rods. During the outage, the plant still received supplies of electricity from one remaining backup line connected to the nearby conventional power plant, Energoatom said. There were three of these lines before the war, but two have been cut. If all external connections go down, it must rely on diesel-fuelled generators for power. If they break down, engineers only have 90 minutes to stave off dangerous overheating. Zelenskiy claimed late on Thursday that the world narrowly avoided a radiation accident. “If the diesel generators had not turned on … if our station staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would have already been forced to overcome the consequences of a radiation accident,” he said in an evening address. “Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster.” He called on the IAEA and other world bodies to act much faster to force Russian troops to leave the territory of the station. The head of Energoatom’s told the Guardian on Wednesday that Russian engineers had drawn up a blueprint to permanently disconnect the plant from the national grid and connect it to the Russian power network instead. Petro Kotin said the plan was ostensibly aimed at maintaining power supply to the plant if all connections to Ukraine were cut off by fighting, as they were on Thursday. But Ukraine fears Russia may deliberately cut the lines. The latest crisis at the plant, which has previously been threatened by fires, came as the death toll from a Russian rocket attack on a railway station and village in south-central Dnipropetrovsk region rose to 25. The three rocket strikes also injured 31, according to Ukraine’s authorities. The area was hit on Independence Day – an anniversary overshadowed by US warnings that Russia may be planning to “step up” attacks. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had successfully hit a military train, killing 200 Ukrainian soldiers. It said the train was set to deliver arms to the frontline in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. It is impossible to corroborate the claims. Ukraine’s authorities do not regularly share information about their military losses. At least some of the victims appear to have been civilians. Pictures and footage of the aftermath aired by Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne showed at least one destroyed house in the village and extensive damage elsewhere. Those interviewed by Suspilne said fellow villagers had died. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s presidential office, said two children, aged six and 11, were killed, the latter when their house was destroyed. Zelenskiy said five people were killed while sitting in a car. Tetyana Kvitnytska, the deputy director of health at the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration, said four children were among the injured, three of whom were in a serious condition. She said there were shrapnel wounds, burns and fractures. Only two pictures have been released so far of the railway carriages that were hit, which appear burnt out and flattened in places. Tymoshenko said five passenger carriages caught fire and a utility building at the railway station had been hit. The EU’s foreign affairs representative, Josep Borrell, wrote on Twitter: “The EU strongly condemns another terrible Russian attack on the civilian population in Chaplyny on Ukraine’s independence day. Those responsible for Russian missile terror will be held accountable.” Russian and Ukrainian forces have reached a relative stalemate in recent months, partly after the west supplied new long-range missiles that have hampered Russia’s supply lines and ability to continue with its offensives. Ukraine says it also does not have the weapons it needs to launch a decisive counteroffensive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/feb/05/billionaire-investor-kretinsky-and-trader-vitol-eye-fortune-in-british-power-plant-subsidies","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-05T16:00:25Z","webTitle":"Billionaire investor Křetínský and trader Vitol eye fortune in British power plant subsidies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/05/billionaire-investor-kretinsky-and-trader-vitol-eye-fortune-in-british-power-plant-subsidies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/feb/05/billionaire-investor-kretinsky-and-trader-vitol-eye-fortune-in-british-power-plant-subsidies","fields":{"bodyText":"The billionaire West Ham United investor Daniel Křetínský and Swiss commodities giant Vitol are among bidders hoping to land hundreds of millions of pounds in subsidies to keep the lights on in Great Britain. National Grid’s electricity system operator is preparing to announce successful bidders in a “capacity market” auction this month for 2026. The annual auction will set a subsidy price to pay owners of power stations and battery storage facilities to cover the cost of being on standby in case of any rapid need for extra electricity. The costs are covered through consumer bills. Existing plants are awarded one-year deals, with new-builds given 15-year contracts to guarantee covering investment costs. Analysis of the public register before the auction shows that 69 new-build gas-fired plants have been proposed for 15-year contracts. Gas accounted for 38% of generation last year – a three-year high as the single largest source of power. The prospect of more fossil-fuel-powered plants may anger green campaigners and those urging the government to move faster in supporting renewables projects. The auction comes as the energy regulator Ofgem draws up proposals to prevent backup generators from raking in “excessive” profits as part of their licence conditions. Energy industry profits are under intense scrutiny amid high consumer bills. Shell caused outrage after unveiling record profits last week, while BP is expected to post fourth-quarter underlying profits of about $5bn on Tuesday. Křetínský, known as the Czech Sphinx for his aversion to publicity, has come to prominence in Britain after taking stakes in Royal Mail, West Ham United FC and the supermarket chain Sainsbury’s. The tycoon’s UK energy assets include the Langage and South Humber Bank gas plants and Lynemouth biomass plant in Northumberland. Křetínský’s EP UK Investments is bidding for 15-year contracts to guarantee supply from three new-build gas units at Eggborough. The North Yorkshire project’s backers argue there is an “urgent need” to replace electricity generation lost from retiring coal and nuclear plants in the UK. EP UK also hopes to land one-year contracts at Langage and South Humber Bank. VPI – owned by Vitol, which has posted rising profits during the energy crisis – wants to secure 15-year contracts to let it build two new gas-fired units at Damhead Creek in Kent. VPI is also bidding for one-year contracts for plants at Immingham in north Lincolnshire, Damhead Creek in Kent, Shoreham outside Brighton, and Rye House in Hertfordshire. Rye House drew scrutiny after it submitted the 20 highest winter bids for power on 12 December, setting new records as National Grid paid out £27m to keep the lights on during cold, still conditions. InterGen, which received an estimated £12.6m on 12 December, is also bidding, for one-year contracts for its sites at Spalding, Rocksavage and Coryton. EP UK’s proposed new-build units at Eggborough could be worth more than £840m in subsidy payments over 15 years while VPI’s plans at Damhead Creek could bring in more than £750m, according to Aurora Energy Research. EP UK’s existing units are expected to be worth more than £64m a year, while Vitol’s trio of plants may account for more than £54m, based on last year’s prices – and prices are expected to rise in this month’s auction, in part due to inflation. Other applications include a Drax project in south Wales and a series of projects in the south-east proposed by Statera Energy. Marlon Dey, head of research for UK and Ireland at Aurora, said: “Gas remains essential for security of supply today, and keeping the lights on during a period of low wind and solar power. There is still a long way to go in order to scale up renewable power to reduce our dependency on gas further. “If gas-fired peaking plants are used sparingly, they will have an important role to play and are not necessarily incompatible with net zero – depending how much they are used.” The government hopes to secure 42GW to 45GW of capacity in the auction on 21 February. Existing plant owners plan to submit bids for 39 gigawatts worth of power, meaning new-build plants must provide 3-6GW – enough to power 2.5m to 5m homes. Last year’s auction set a price of £30.59 per kW hour to secure 42GW of power, at a cost of £2.1bn over 15 years. Separately, National Grid said on Sunday it had asked owner Uniper to put a unit at its coal-fired power plant at Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire on standby in case it is needed on Tuesday during a period of low wind."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-latest-updates-putin-zelenskiy","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-06T17:03:55Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war ‘about to enter new phase’ as Russian forces gather in the south, UK intelligence warns – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-latest-updates-putin-zelenskiy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-latest-updates-putin-zelenskiy","fields":{"bodyText":"The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) expressed concerns about the shelling the previous day at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, saying the action showed the risk of a nuclear disaster, Reuters reports. “I’m extremely concerned by the shelling yesterday at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster that could threaten public health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond,” director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement. He added that military action jeopardising the safety and security of the Zaporizhzhia plant “is completely unacceptable and must be avoided at all costs”. “Any military firepower directed at or from the facility would amount to playing with fire, with potentially catastrophic consequences.” Ukraine’s Prosecutor General’s office said it had started criminal proceedings against what it said was rocket and artillery shelling by the Russian military of Zaporizhzhia power plant on Friday. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s State Security Service (SBU) detained two men it accused of being Russian intelligence agents responsible for identifying targets for Russian missile strikes that wrecked shipbulding infrastructure in the southern port city of Mykolaiv, the agency said. The two men “collected and transmitted intelligence to the enemy about important infrastructure facilities, fuel depots, the deployment and movement of personnel and equipment of (Ukraine’s) Armed Forces,” the SBU said in a post on messaging app Telegram. As a result, the SBU said several shipbuilding enterprises and fuel depots were damaged or destroyed. The agency said both men were now being held in custody. It did not say when the infrastructure was hit. The head of Amnesty International’s Ukraine office has quit the human rights body in a disagreement after the group accused Ukraine’s armed forces of endangering civilians by basing troops in residential areas during the Russian invasion. Amnesty made the comments in a report published on Thursday that drew fierce criticism from the Ukrainian government, Reuters reports. Amnesty’s Ukraine head Oksana Pokalchuk said on Facebook late on Friday that she was resigning as she opposed the report’s publication, and now understood that she could not get it changed or removed. Pokalchuk said the human rights group unwittingly “created material that sounded like support for Russian narratives of the invasion. In an effort to protect civilians, this study became a tool of Russian propaganda”. “It pains me to admit it, but we disagreed with the leadership of Amnesty International on values. That’s why I decided to leave the organization.” Asked about Pokalchuk’s resignation, an Amnesty spokesperson quoted Agnes Callamard, the organisation’s secretary general, as saying: *Oksana has been a valued member of Amnesty staff, and has led the Amnesty International Ukraine office for seven years with many significant human rights successes.” “We are sorry to hear that she is leaving the organization, but we respect her decision and wish her well. Ukrainian officials say they take every possible measure to evacuate civilians from front-line areas. Russia denies targeting civilians in what it describes as a “special military operation” in Ukraine. North Macedonia has agreed to supply tanks and planes to Ukraine, Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said. It was previously reported that North Macedonia would supply Soviet-era tanks but there was no mention of aircraft deliveries. Podolyak said: “Many nations are showing more courage today than half of the G20. “Like North Macedonia, giving Ukraine a (supportive) shoulder in the form of tanks and planes.” It’s 4pm in London and 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s a summary of the latest developments in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The EU has condemned Russia’s actions regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The plant has been described as being “a serious risk” by Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company, Energoatom. Inside Olenivka, the notorious detention centre outside Donetsk, dozens of Ukrainian soldiers have been burned to death while many others face torture under a regime of “absolute evil”, Anna Vorosheva, a 45-year-old Ukrainian entrepreneur who spent time in the jail, has told the Observer. Russia is amassing troops in the south of Ukraine but the purpose of the build-up is not yet clear, UK intelligence has warned. The Ministry of Defence says Russian forces could be preparing for a new assault or merely anticipating a counter-offensive from Ukraine. Meta, formerly Facebook, have removed a network of Instagram accounts operated by a troll farm in St. Petersburg, Russia. 45 Facebook accounts and 1,037 Instagram accounts were removed and the report found that around $1,400 had been spent in rubles to pay for ads on Facebook and Instagram. Overnight Russian shelling in the Dnipropetrovsk oblast injured three people and destroyed residential buildings, including a kindergarten and a children’s art centre, according to reports from the Kyiv Independent. Pro-Russian forces in the Russian-occupied cities of the Luhansk region of Ukraine are using humanitarian aid to lure residents to provide personal data to partake in a referendum on joining Russia. The EU has condemned Russia’s actions regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Josep Borrell Fontelles, the high respresentative of the EU for foreign affairs and security policy and vice-president of the EU Commission, tweeted: “This is a serious and irresponsible breach of nuclear safety rules and another example of Russia’s disregard for international norms”, and called for Russian forces occupying the plant to give open access to the International Atomic Energy Agency. The plant has been described as being ““a serious risk” by Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company, Energoatom. Inside Olenivka, the notorious detention centre outside Donetsk, dozens of Ukrainian soldiers have been burned to death while many others face torture under a regime of “absolute evil”, Anna Vorosheva, a 45-year-old Ukrainian entrepreneur who spent time in the jail, has told the Observer. Vorosheva said she had no doubt Russia “cynically and deliberately” murdered Ukrainian prisoners of war after fighters were blown up on 29 July in a mysterious and devastating explosion. Moscow claims Ukraine killed them with a US-made precision-guided Himars rocket, but satellite images and independent analysis suggest they were obliterated by a powerful bomb detonated from inside the building. “Russia didn’t want them to stay alive. I’m sure some of those ‘killed’ in the explosion were already corpses. It was a convenient way of accounting for the fact they had been tortured to death,” Vorosheva said. The Ukrainian governor of Luhansk province, Serhiy Haidai, has posted a photo on his Telegram channel which appears to show the head of a Ukrainian prisoner of war stuck on a pole outside a house in the eastern Ukrainian city of Popasna, which was captured by Russian forces in May and is close to the current frontline in the Donbas. The Guardian has not confirmed the authenticity of the photo. Geolocation tools suggest it is genuine and was taken in late July, not far from the centre of Popasna. The photo is the latest in a string of apparent atrocities committed by Russian forces since the invasion started in February. Pro-Russian forces in the Russian-occupied cities of the Luhansk region of Ukraine are using humanitarian aid to lure residents to provide personal data to partake in a referendum on joining Russia, Sergei Gaidai, the head of Luhansk military administration has reported on his Telegram channel. The post suggests that campaigning and data collecting is being carried out at events which are being offered to provide support and humanitarian aid to residents of the occupied areas. “Under the guise of providing food or construction materials, the occupying power and the collaborating public movement organise meetings with the population of the recently captured territories of the region,” Gaidai said in the post. According to Gaidai the Russian forces “lure out personal data, urge people to go to the so-called referendum” while “forcing people to exchange their will for food or drinking water”. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify this information. Here are some of the latest images from photographers on the ground in Ukraine: Concerns are growing for the safety of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after an attack by Russian anti-aircraft missiles on 5 August. At the plant, which was severely damaged according to a report on the Telegram account of Energoatom, the Ukrainian state nuclear operator, emergency protection measures have been activated and one of the three working power units was turned off. The post reported the plant remains in the control of the Russian military but added that “Ukrainian staff of the station continue to work and make every effort to ensure nuclear and radiation safety”. The plant, which is the largest in Europe and the third largest in the world, generates energy for Ukraine and has been controlled by the Russian military since 4 March when Russian troops captured Energodar, the city where the plant is located. Hello, it’s 11.15am in London and 1.15pm in Kyiv. Here’s a summary of the latest developments in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia is amassing troops in the south of Ukraine but the purpose of the build-up is not yet clear, UK intelligence has warned. The Ministry of Defence says Russian forces could be preparing for a new assault or merely anticipating a counter-offensive from Ukraine.

A European Union plan to cut gas use and help Germany wean itself off dependency on Russia will come into effect early next week, the bloc’s presidency said on Friday. Last week, EU member states agreed to reduce their use of gas by 15% over the winter, with exceptions for some countries and despite opposition from Hungary. A leading Russian hypersonics expert has been arrested on suspicion of treason, the state-controlled Tass news agency reported on Friday. Andrei Shiplyuk heads the hypersonics laboratory at the Novosibirsk Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, according to the institute’s website, and has in recent years coordinated research to support the development of hypersonic missile systems, Reuters reports. Overnight Russian shelling in the Dnipropetrovsk oblast injured three people and destroyed residential buildings, including a kindergarten and a children’s art centre, according to reports from the Kyiv Independent. Meta, formerly Facebook, has removed a network of Instagram accounts operated by a troll farm in St Petersburg, Russia, according to its newest report into global threats, the Kyiv Independent reports. The accounts, which aimed to create a perception of online support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, posted pro-Russian comments on content shared by social media influencers and media. The physical troll farm was operating out of an office building in St Petersburg, which had 10 days previously prior advertised job postings for “spammers, commenters, content analysts, designers and programmers” focused on the social media platforms, YouTube, Telegram and TikTok. The accounts were targeting politicians, journalists, actors, celebrities and commercial brands from around the world that were vocal in their support for Ukraine. 45 Facebook accounts and 1,037 Instagram accounts were removed and the report found that around $1,400 had been spent in rubles to pay for ads on Facebook and Instagram. Overnight Russian shelling in the Dnipropetrovsk oblast injured three people and destroyed residential buildings, including a kindergarten and a children’s art centre, according to reports from the Kyiv Independent. The attacks left several thousand people without power or water, as gas and water pipelines and the electricity network were compromised. Oksana Pokalchuk, the head of Amnesty International’s office in Ukraine, has resigned from her role following a report published by the human rights organisation which accused the Ukrainian military of breaching international humanitarian law. The report, which has been criticised by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as well as western diplomats, including the British and US ambassadors to Ukraine, accused the Ukrainian military of putting civilians at risk by positioning themselves in residential areas such as empty schools or civilian buildings, meaning Russia will target urban areas risking civilian lives in the crossfire. Announcing her resignation via Facebook, Pokalchuk said she held meetings with Amnesty International to discuss what they were going to publish but said that her input was “deleted” and replaced with what the organisation published in its report on Thursday. “If you don’t live in a country invaded by invaders and are tearing it to pieces, you probably don’t understand what it’s like to condemn an army of defenders. And there are no words in any language that can convey this to someone who has not felt this pain,” Pokalchuk said. The report has since been used by Kremlin-directed Russian media as a way to evidence their false claims that Russian forces are only going after military targets in Ukraine. Despite ongoing criticism, Amnesty International said that while it condemned Russia’s invasion, the report’s findings were based on evidence gathered during extensive investigations and that it would report Ukrainian violations when it observed them. Here are some of the latest images from photographers on the ground in Ukraine: We’ve got more from the UK’s MoD. On what Ukraine’s troops are focusing on, it adds: Ukrainian forces are focusing their targeting on bridges, ammunition depots, and rail links with growing frequency in Ukraine’s southern regions. Including the strategically important railroad spur that links Kherson to Russian-occupied Crimea, almost certainly using a combination of block, damage, degrade, deny, destroy, and disrupt effects to try to affect Russia’s ability to logistically resupply. The MoD then adds it believes the war is about to enter a “new phase”. Russia’s war on Ukraine is about to enter a new phase, with the heaviest fighting shifting to a roughly 350km frontline stretching south-west from near Zaporizhzhia to Kherson, paralleling the Dnieper River. As we just mentioned, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has revealed there is a significant build-up of Russian forces in southern Ukraine. However, the MoD said it was unclear whether these additional forces were for a new assault on Ukrainian territory or in anticipation for a Ukrainian counteroffensive. It reported: Long convoys of Russian military trucks, tanks, towed artillery, and other weapons continue to move away from Ukraine’s Donbas region and are headed south-west. Equipment was also reported to be moving from Russian-occupied Melitopol, Berdiansk, Mariupol and from mainland Russia via the Kerch Bridge into Crimea. Battalion tactical groups (BTG), which comprise between 800 and 1,000 troops, have been deployed to Crimea and would almost certainly be used to support Russian troops in the Kherson region. On 02 August 2022, a new BTG had been deployed to Crimea and BTGs are also being re-deployed from Eastern Grouping of Forces. These will highly likely be sent into the Kherson region in the coming days. Good morning, it’s approaching 7.30am in London and 9.30am in Kyiv. Here’s a summary of the latest developments in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia is amassing troops in the south of Ukraine but the purpose of the build-up is not yet clear, UK intelligence has warned. The Ministry of Defence says Russian forces could be preparing for a new assault or merely anticipating a counter-offensive from Ukraine Ukraine has accused Russian forces of strikes near a nuclear reactor at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia power plant in the country’s south-east. Energoatom, the state-run operator of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, said in a statement: “Three strikes were recorded on the site of the plant, near one of the power blocks where the nuclear reactor is located.” Russia’s defence ministry accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the plant, saying a leak of radiation had been avoided only by luck. A European Union plan to cut gas use and help Germany wean itself off dependency on Russia will come into effect early next week, the bloc’s presidency said on Friday.

Vladimir Putin has met Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for talks that were expected to focus on Russia’s war in Ukraine and that are being rumoured to include Kremlin efforts to circumvent western sanctions. The Russian president welcomed Erdoğan to Sochi, a resort city on the Black Sea, by thanking the Turkish president for help in securing an international deal that resumed grain exports from Ukraine that had been disrupted by the Kremlin war machine – as well as Russian foodstuffs and fertilisers – to world markets. They agreed to boost cooperation in the transport, agriculture, finance and construction industries, they said in a joint statement after a four-hour meeting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/dec/22/thousands-left-without-power-in-victoria-as-huge-storm-sweeps-state","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-22T16:32:00Z","webTitle":"Thousands left without power in Victoria as huge storm sweeps state","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/22/thousands-left-without-power-in-victoria-as-huge-storm-sweeps-state","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/dec/22/thousands-left-without-power-in-victoria-as-huge-storm-sweeps-state","fields":{"bodyText":"Thousands of Victorians have been left without power and Melbourne airport has been forced to ground flights as a major storm front swept across the state’s south. There was also extreme weather on the way for parts of the Northern Territory and West Australian coasts on Friday as a tropical low deepened over the Timor Sea. More than 5,500 households and customers were experiencing power outages in Victoria as of 8.30pm on Thursday, many in Melbourne’s western suburbs. The Bureau of Meteorology issued a severe thunderstorm warning for large parts of the state from Echuca in the north to Geelong in the south amid the downpour. The weather event first hit the Geelong, Port Phillip and the Bellarine peninsula regions on Thursday afternoon, moving east to north-east as the night progressed. Melbourne airport was lashed with the heaviest initial downpour, recording 40mm of rain in the 20 minutes to 5.30pm, resulting in the delays of a number of inbound and outbound flights. Hail up to 3cm in diameter was reported in Geelong around the same time, while Tatura recorded 26mm of rain in the 30 minutes to 7pm. A spokesperson for Melbourne airport said all aerodrome operations were temporarily suspended on Thursday due to the risk of lightning, which resulted in the grounded flights. “Now that the storm has passed, ground staff have resumed operations and are working to safely get passengers to their destinations,” they said. “This afternoon’s storm has resulted in a significant number of water leaks across Melbourne airport’s terminals and we are currently cleaning up the impacted areas. “The safety of passengers and staff is our top priority. We apologise to passengers for the inconvenience.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Areas impacted later on Thursday evening included metropolitan Melbourne and the regional cities of Shepparton, Seymour, Ballarat, Geelong, Wangaratta, Traralgon and Bairnsdale. Parts of Craigieburn were already experiencing flooding and building damage as the storm moved through Melbourne, the Victoria Emergency website confirmed. “A low pressure trough is combining with a moist and unstable atmosphere to produce showers and thunderstorms across much of Victoria,” the BoM said. “Heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding, damaging winds and large hailstones are likely.” Victoria’s State Emergency Service (SES) warned Victorians to avoid travel if possible amid dangerous conditions and, if on the road, to look out for hazards including flood water and fallen trees. It said recent storms may make trees unstable and likelier to fall amid windy or wet conditions. A flood warning remained in place for the state’s Murray and Edward rivers, with prolonged flooding continuing at Euston, Mildura, Wentworth, Moulamein, Barham, Wakool Junction and Boundary Bend. The Murray wasn’t expected to fall below a minor flood level in Victoria until early January as water moves into South Australia’s catchments. Conditions have eased in the Mallee district, leading to the cancellation of a severe thunderstorm warning. The BoM said the tropical low across northern Australia may develop into a tropical cyclone on Friday morning before crossing the coast near the Western Australia-NT border. It declared a warning zone from Dundee Beach in the NT to Kalumburu in WA including Wadeye, Kununurra and Wyndham, but not including Kalumburu. Senior meteorologist Rebecca Patrick told the ABC the system would weaken when it passed over land but regardless of its intensity “it will remain as a deep depression and still bring heavy rainfall”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/apr/24/bbc-singers-lso-review-music-and-words-of-power-as-rattle-protests-vandalism-of-uks-musical-life","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-24T12:05:47Z","webTitle":"BBC Singers/LSO review – music, and words, of power as Rattle protests vandalism of UK’s musical life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/24/bbc-singers-lso-review-music-and-words-of-power-as-rattle-protests-vandalism-of-uks-musical-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/apr/24/bbc-singers-lso-review-music-and-words-of-power-as-rattle-protests-vandalism-of-uks-musical-life","fields":{"bodyText":"Mahler’s Seventh Symphony was originally intended as the sole work in this evening’s concert. Such, however, was the outrage over the threat to so many of the UK’s classical music ensembles and companies that the LSO invited the now reprieved BBC Singers to perform Poulenc’s Figure humaine as well, as a gesture of solidarity. Speaking after the interval, Simon Rattle protested how “the Arts Council’s swingeing cuts in November” and “the proposed vandalism by the BBC” have affected the musical life of this country, angrily inveighing the “political ignorance of what this artform entails” and the “stubborn pride in that ignorance” on the part of those who have wreaked such havoc. Poulenc’s piece itself carries enormous symbolic resonance. Written in secret under Nazi occupation in 1943-44, and an iconic Resistance work, it sets texts by Paul Éluard for two a cappella six-part choruses. Poulenc initially intended it for French choirs after the Liberation, but given the complexity of its vocal writing, he eventually allocated it to the BBC Singers (known at the time as the BBC Chorus), who gave the first performance in March 1945. Hearing them sing it is a reminder both of their greatness as an ensemble, and of their centrality as interpreters in musical history. It was done with fierce intelligence and great conviction. Rattle gave the music space for dissonances and detail to register without fracturing tensions or momentum, and the emotional trajectory from quiet anger to the tremendous closing demand for freedom was exactingly and thrillingly plotted. Mahler’s Seventh was often superb, too. The opening movement was a rollercoaster ride, a thing of jolts, contrasts, mood swings and moments of beauty. Rattle’s attention to detail in Mahler emerged in the central nocturnes and scherzo, swivelling between retro Romantic nostalgia and fragmentary anticipations of the worlds of Schoenberg and Berg: the second Nachtmusik sounded particularly gorgeous here. The bucolic finale can so often seem at a tangent from the rest of the work and did so here, despite the energy Rattle brought to it. The playing was virtuosic in its brilliance throughout."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jun/09/russian-armed-forces-infighting-yevgeny-prigozhin","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-09T05:00:51Z","webTitle":"As Russia’s armed forces fight among themselves, it’s hard to know who’s in control | Samantha de Bendern","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/09/russian-armed-forces-infighting-yevgeny-prigozhin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/09/russian-armed-forces-infighting-yevgeny-prigozhin","fields":{"bodyText":"Coming just a day before the world’s media became submerged in the tragic aftermath of the explosion of the Kakhovka dam in Russian-controlled Ukraine, Yevgeny Prigozhin’s latest invective against the Russian army on 5 June slipped under the radar. It was his most explosive yet. Dressed in a khaki sweatshirt and trousers, in the middle of a forest in a Wagner training camp, Prigozhin, the commander of an army of contract fighters known as the Wagner group, accuses the Russian army of lying about events in the Belgorod region – where anti-Putin Russian partisans have been conducting cross-border raids from Ukraine since late May – and warns of the risk of civil war. He calls for the Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu to be put on trial for facilitating “the genocide of the Russian population” by being totally unprepared for the war in Ukraine, and more than once suggests that Shoigu and other senior military command should be shot. Prigozhin also claims that inhabitants of the Belgorod region have been writing to him, suggesting a Chile-type solution. “Chile means Pinochet,” explains Prigozhin. “… The Russian elite in a stadium surrounded by armed men with machine guns.” Prigozhin even plays the nuclear card, initially saying that it would be counterproductive to use it now and that “the button should have been pressed earlier … even though it would have been the act of a fucked-up psychopath”. Later in the interview he suggests that Russians would be capable of using a nuclear weapon on their own territory. This comes with the comforting caveat that he’s unsure how well nuclear weapons would work if they are as badly maintained as the rest of Russia’s weaponry. Thе hour-long interview follows Prigozhin’s tour of Russian cities during which he spoke of the need to open a “second front”, in the information sphere, to tell the population the truth about what is happening on the front lines and recommended the creation of a territorial army specifically to protect Russia. Even though he denies having any political ambitions, all these elements together look very much like a politician preparing either for an electoral campaign or an armed coup. The question remains whether Prigozhin is controlled by the Kremlin, or is a loose cannon posing a serious threat to the regime. Since in Russia nothing is ever as it seems, this either/or question is probably far too simple. Some things however seem clearer than others. Prigozhin would not be able to travel around Russia holding court without support and protection at the highest level. Moreover, as he vilifies what he calls the corrupt elites and calls with impunity for them to be executed, Russia’s most famous anti-corruption campaigner, Alexei Navalny, is rotting away in a penal colony and faces a potential 30-year prison sentence. Those with protection in the right places can say what they want. After taking Bakhmut, Prigozhin decided to withdraw his forces, leaving the regular Russian army to hold the city. Was he allowed to do this in the knowledge that Russia’s grip on Bakhmut was threatened by the Ukrainian armed forces who have regained control of parts of the surrounding countryside? If in the coming weeks the Russians lose the city, the regular army will be blamed, and Prigozhin’s Bakhmut victory will be intact. Again, this points to patronage at the highest level allowing him to save face. By suggesting the creation of a territorial defence and opening what he calls his second Wagner front domestically, Prigozhin appears to be positioning himself to play a mix of policing, security and information/propaganda roles inside Russia. This is vastly different from being a proxy foreign policy tool and private army operating abroad, particularly considering that Wagner, like most other private military companies (apart from those created to protect critical infrastructure), is still officially illegal. Without high-up support it seems hard to imagine how long this ambition will go unchallenged. Another thing that is becoming clearer is intra-Russian chaos and animosity, if not outright armed conflict. In the last week, Wagner forces detained an officer of the Russian federal army whom they accused of mining their retreat and shooting at them while drunk; anti-Putin Russian partisans captured Russian regular forces and invited the governor of the Belgorod region to negotiate their freedom; and a high-ranking Chechen fighter openly criticised Yevgeny Prigozhin, highlighting the rivalry between the Chechen forces and Wagner. Without counting the mounting jealousies between the growing number of Russian private armies, the above describes at least four factions of armed Russians (including one fighting on the Ukrainian side) in conflict with each other. If one accepts that Prigozhin is protected by the Kremlin, to what extent does the Kremlin actually mean Putin? So far Prigozhin has refrained from direct attacks on the president and has even said that he respects him. However, by mocking Russia’s nuclear decision-making and capabilities in his recent harangue, he appears to be undermining the very concept of Russia’s nuclear deterrent. It is hard not to see this as a criticism of Putin who is the ultimate arbiter of nuclear use. Double, triple bluff? Prigozhin’s latest rant looks more and more like the tip of an iceberg that betrays growing fractures inside Russia’s top power structure. In a country that cannot even defend a small sliver of its border from incursions and allows drones to hit the centre of power, it is difficult to imagine a master in the Kremlin who has the absolute control, foresight and planning capacity necessary to manage all this chaos and pull Prigozhin’s puppet strings. In February 2022, two days before the invasion of Ukraine, senior members of Russia’s security council cowered in submission before a seemingly omnipotent Putin. As the war grinds on, these same men may be the ones planning to take control from a president who seems increasingly divorced from the realities of the front line. They will need a scapegoat for the disastrous “special military operation”. With his frequent diatribes against the regular army, Prigozhin is handing them the heads of the Russian armed forces on a plate. Perhaps he is also promising to be their front man and guarantor of immunity as he helps navigate the chaos to come. Whether or not this includes Putin is anyone’s guess.

A recent cover essay of the Spectator struck a similar note, claiming a “new woke elite” is now “destined to rule over an increasingly divided and embittered society”. Pieces in the Sun, Mail and the Times raised the same alarm. The diagnosis is clear: don’t be fooled by the Conservatives’ long residence in No 10 – a cabal of middle-class liberals, out of step with the public and covertly led by Gary Lineker, is really ruling Britain. It’s hard not to feel like we’ve been here before. Wasn’t the Tories’ triumph over the European Union supposed to free Britain from the grip of unelected elites, once and for all? Alas, no sooner did the Conservatives slay one set of out-of-touch rulers than another one arose in their place – the bureaucrats in Brussels have morphed seamlessly into a new progressive aristocracy, comprising everyone from civil servants to junior doctors to the judiciary, opposing the Conservatives’ singular right to rule over Britain unopposed. Yet again, the Conservatives are the ones who represent “real” Britain, while their opponents are anti-democratic and unpatriotic, deploying all kinds of nefarious means to obstruct the people’s will. Psychologists have a word for this phenomenon: projection – the process by which someone displaces their own negative traits or insecurities on to someone else. The Conservatives have long excelled in using projection as a political weapon. While it is their party that defends the interests of bosses, property owners and those with inherited wealth, they claim Labour is driven by elite self-interest. While they happily take donations from oligarchs, it’s the left that is under the sway of foreign powers. The Tories love nothing more than to reign over Westminster and Fleet Street while raging against what Margaret Thatcher called the enemy within. Such narratives have been pushed by the party and its supporters ever since the Labour party came into existence. “The British Labour party, as it impudently calls itself, is not British at all,” the Mail declared in November 1923, as its proprietor impudently cosied up to Benito Mussolini on the continent. And they have been endlessly useful. Not only does the persistence of an “enemy within” or “new elite” exonerate the Tories’ failures in government – implying that actually existing Conservatism has never been tried and so justifying the seizure of more power – but it also implausibly places the wealthy Tory elite and the proverbial “man on the street” on the same side, jointly opposed to this undemocratic foe. Ever since the dawn of Britain’s democracy, Conservatives have had to find extravagant ways to make this outlandish positioning convincing. For a long time, empire and monarchy gave them the unifying cause they craved. With the globe beneath Britain’s paw, even those at the bottom of the hierarchy at home could be encouraged to look down on all others abroad: to be born English, the famous saying went, was to have won first prize in the lottery of life, whether you were a butler or a baron. But after the second world war and the dissolution of empire, the Tories needed a new way to distort and disguise Britain’s divides. They found it at Britain’s borders. “It is possible that Tory attitudes on immigration will strike a working-class response and replace the old-style imperialism,” the influential Conservative MP John Biffen wrote in 1965. Enoch Powell delivered his “rivers of blood” speech three years later. They never looked back. In Powell’s reconfiguration of post-imperial Britain, the world was no longer beneath Britain’s paw but instead queueing at the gates, desperate to be let in. This narrative, advanced by his disciple Thatcher and sustained by every Tory leader since, has proved similarly empowering, and even more useful: it offers the Conservatives not only a way of appealing across classes, but an alibi for the miserable state of the country’s public services and economy. If Britain is no longer great, it is because it is too generous, spreading its greatness so thinly that the nation’s “native” citizens suffer for it. Any leftwing or liberal defence of immigration can be held up as proof of treachery: whose side are they on? But despite their patriotic odes to the British people, the Conservatives remain a fundamentally elitist and anti-democratic force. They are wedded to an unrepresentative political system that allows the party to frame fine-margin victories – often involving the votes of little more than a quarter of the electorate – as towering majorities. Just as austerity deliberately eroded local democracy, curtailing the power of opposition-led councils to improve people’s lives, the Tories’ latest move to push through voter ID under a fictitious threat of voter fraud – a measure that is likely to disfranchise millions of people, most of them less well-off – represents yet another move to disempower the public. It is a naked articulation of the Conservatives’ method: muzzle Britain in the name of protecting it, shoring up their own power. The result is confounding: a ruling class that refuses to take any responsibility for ruling, an elite that enriches its chums while calling their opponents self-serving, a vandal that imagines itself the victim. As long ago as 1871, the novelist Anthony Trollope saw this duplicity as a feature of the Conservative mind. “They feel among themselves that everything that is being done is bad – even though that everything is done by their own party,” he wrote in the novel The Eustace Diamonds. “To have been always in the right and yet always on the losing side … A huge, living, daily increasing grievance that does one no palpable harm, is the happiest possession that a man can have.” More than 150 years later, Trollope’s words have an eerie resonance. Conservatives feel that everything that is being done is bad, even though almost all of it is done by them. They lament the state of the nation even as they lead it. Last week’s local election results suggest the public’s patience may be fading. But while the Tories may mourn Britain’s decline, so long as they remain in power, they seem happy in their unhappiness, confident that there will always be someone else to blame, someone else to suffer the consequences.

She recalls standing on stage at her north Wales convent school reciting a poem and “in that moment feeling transported to another realm of existence. I remember thinking: ‘I prefer it here.’ The reality is that I still feel that way. As much as I love my life, I do prefer to be in the realm of the imagination. It is the place where I am my truest self.” Scanlan, who is 61, is installed in a meeting room at her publicist’s office in Soho, London. It has been a long morning of interviews, but if she is tired of talking she is too nice to show it; her default setting is sunny and self-effacing. She is here to discuss The Light in the Hall, a psychological thriller set in Carmarthenshire which has been shot in English and Welsh (Scanlan learned her lines with the help of her Welsh-speaking niece). She plays Sharon, whose teenage daughter, Ela, was murdered 18 years ago. A local gardener, Joe Pritchard (Game of Thrones’ Iwan Rheon) was convicted of the crime, but never revealed why he did it or what he did with the body. When he is released on parole, Sharon determines to find out what happened to her child. Researching the role, Scanlan read a series of victim personal statements in murder cases, where relatives of the dead explain how the crime has affected them. “They are the most gut-punching pieces of writing I think I’ve ever read,” she says. “This isn’t dialogue from a TV drama or a novel. This is people’s lives. They are there as a voice for the lost life, and the continual loss of life that is played out within a family when a person is killed.” The series delves deep into the notion of truth and how it can become warped when a crime is committed. Scanlan has first-hand experience of this, having witnessed the assault of a male friend in a pub when she was a student. A man passing their table had knocked his pint to the floor, seemingly on purpose, and a fight ensued. Her friend was so badly beaten that he had to go to hospital, and Scanlan made a police statement. A few months later, she was called to give evidence in court. “I was sitting outside waiting to be called in and there was a bloke sitting beside me who was the weediest-looking guy imaginable,” she says. “I thought he was one of the solicitor’s team. But then our representative came out and asked if I wanted to re-read the statement I had made on the night of the crime. So I read it and there, in my own words, was a perfect description of the man who had been sitting beside me.” Scanlan lets out a horrified laugh. “So, in the gap between the guy punching my friend and me being hauled into court to give evidence, I had reimagined this bloke as fucking Arnold Schwarzenegger!” In court, Scanlan learned more about the perpetrator and found herself feeling sympathy for him: he had a young family and had recently lost his job. “I mean, the incident shouldn’t have happened,” she says, “but I had made so many internal judgments about the perpetrators of crime, and I had mapped that on to the reality we were now looking at. So, in playing Sharon, this question of how we judge perpetrators of crime, and what contexts and mitigation there may be, was strong in my mind.” The Light in the Hall is Scanlan’s first major role since winning a Bafta for best leading actress in After Love, Aleem Khan’s film which cast her as a widow from Dover who discovers her late husband, a ferry captain, had a secret family in Calais. The film critic Mark Kermode described her performance as “a masterclass in the dramatic power of understatement”. On picking up her award, Scanlan said: “Some stories have surprise endings, don’t they?” “Well, I really had surprised myself,” she says now. “For a start, I had never imagined playing a leading role. But I also started acting very late – I didn’t perform professionally until I was 35 – so I’ve always had this sense of running to catch up. If someone said to me now that they were thinking of becoming an actor in their mid-30s, I’d probably say: ‘That boat may well have sailed.’” Since her breakout role as Terri, the put-upon civil servant in The Thick of It, Scanlan has rarely wanted for work: she has played a ward sister in the hospital sitcom Getting On (which she also co-wrote); an exasperated detective in Paul Abbott’s No Offence; a mother superior in Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat’s Dracula; and a cheerful farmer’s wife in The Larkins. Still, she has lost count of the projects she has been involved with that never got off the ground or simply failed to capture viewers’ imaginations. “There’s a lot of snakes and ladders in this game. You do something wonderful and then – bam! – it’s cancelled. So in that sense, the surprise of getting a Bafta was real. Here I was standing on stage as a leading lady being honoured by my peers. I still think to myself: ‘Did that really happen?’” It was, famously, a doctor who persuaded Scanlan to pursue acting. Prior to that, she had worked at Leicester’s De Montfort University and, later, at the Arts Council. At 29, she was signed off work following a bout of depression and extreme fatigue. The doctor in question asked her whether she had ever wanted to do anything else with her life. When she said she had wanted to act, he told her: “If you don’t do this, you will be ill for the rest of your life.” His words were “like an arrow going straight into my sternum. I didn’t doubt him at all.” Scanlan describes her early childhood as “idyllic”: she grew up in rural Cheshire “surrounded by animals and no people” and spent most of her time outdoors. “That time spent finding fairy rings, jumping over rivers, being stung by nettles 100 times a day; I think my inner self was forged in that landscape.” When she was 13, her parents bought a hotel in Ruthin, north Wales. Throughout her teens, she worked every job going: cleaner, waitress, bartender, receptionist. “Hotels are much like theatres in that everyone is playing a role,” she says. “I would stand behind the bar polishing glasses and eavesdropping on people’s lives. I found them totally absorbing and I learned so much about people, which clearly fed into what I do now.” And what of her career now, as a Bafta-winning actor? No Offence writer Abbott said recently that Scanlan was “about to go ballistic. We’ll see her disappearing off into Netflix and Hollywood now.” She looks thoughtful when I mention this. “It’s a strangely stratified world, our industry, and awards mean you get on new lists. I have always put excellence and creativity first, and I’ve been lucky enough that around 80% of what I’ve done has been really good. But now I’m in this luxurious position of being considered a leading actor, and that is tremendously exciting.” It is different, she adds, when you have a supporting part, which means “you’re just in and out [on set]. What comes with a leading role is that sense of responsibility for the whole. You’re there with the crew from beginning to end, and there’s something about that that suits me.” While sitting in a taxi early this morning, Scanlan found herself idly thinking about the kind of roles she hasn’t yet done, but would like to. “I have always played people who are under the radar,” she reflects. “I get packaged as quite ordinary. So I would really like to harness my power. I don’t think I’ve played many characters with real welly. I feel like there is this rageful power [in me] that could be quite compelling that hasn’t been unleashed. But now I think I’m ready.” The Light In the Hall is on Channel 4 from 4 January at 9pm and streams on All 4."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/21/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-funding-approved-despite-tory-split","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T14:38:35Z","webTitle":"Sizewell C nuclear plant funding approved despite Tory split","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/21/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-funding-approved-despite-tory-split","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/21/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-funding-approved-despite-tory-split","fields":{"bodyText":"Boris Johnson has approved funding for a new nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk in the final weeks of his premiership, but some of Liz Truss’s senior allies are split over the decision. The prime minister and the chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, approved financing for the construction of two new reactors known as Sizewell C, enabling private funding of about £20-30bn to be raised. However, Simon Clarke, another key Truss ally and a Treasury minister, warned in a letter leaked to the Sunday Times that the decision could limit Truss’s economic vision. In the letter, he said the costs of Sizewell C were “sufficient to materially affect spending and fiscal choices for an incoming government, especially in the context of wider pressures on the public finances”. In an article for the Mail on Sunday, Kwasi Kwarteng stressed the need to “crack on with more nuclear power stations” in order to increase Britain’s energy security. He gave development consent for Sizewell C in July, but negotiations over the government’s investment decision had been ongoing. A Whitehall source said Boris Johnson had taken the decision to press ahead with Sizewell several weeks ago. However, he dismissed the idea that the move would tie the hands of the next prime minister, following reports that the Truss campaign was worried that it was irreversible. “In the next few weeks, we will announce a government investment decision on Sizewell C where the government formally commits to the project’s financing. It allows the project to raise private capital in the markets. But it’s only at the point of the final investment decision in early 2023 that the government would formalise any equity share.” Johnson’s decision over Sizewell was challenged by a campaign to stop the nuclear reactor being built. A spokesperson for the campaign, Stop Sizewell C, said: “Whatever way you look at it, this is a very dodgy decision. Has it been made by a lame duck PM who is not supposed to tie the hands of his successor, or was it in fact made before Sizewell C was granted planning consent, lending serious weight to our conviction that this was a prejudiced, political decision? “Our next prime minister should call Sizewell C in. There are so many better ways to spend billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money than on a project that won’t light a single lightbulb for at least a decade.” Truss has not stated a clear position on Sizewell C, but hinted last year at concerns about the involvement of China’s state-owned energy company, CGN, as part of a consortium providing funding for the preparatory work at the nuclear plant. She told the Telegraph at the time: “I think it’s very important that we don’t become strategically dependent and I think it’s important that we make sure that we’re working, particularly in areas of critical national infrastructure, with reliable partners.” EDF, the French state energy firm, worked with CGN on the first phase of the project for a new nuclear power station to sit alongside Sizewell B, which is operational, and Sizewell A, which is being decommissioned. The UK government is keen to ease CGN out, however, over concerns about Chinese involvement in sensitive assets. Johnson’s government has already put up £100m of funding this year to support the development of Sizewell C."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2022/sep/16/why-future-sea-levels-matter-to-suffolks-sizewell-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-16T05:00:08Z","webTitle":"Why future sea levels matter to Suffolk’s Sizewell nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/sep/16/why-future-sea-levels-matter-to-suffolks-sizewell-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2022/sep/16/why-future-sea-levels-matter-to-suffolks-sizewell-nuclear-plant","fields":{"bodyText":"The caution of scientists, reinforced by accusations scaremongering from the well-funded fossil fuel lobby, has meant computer estimates of sea level rise in official forecasts have been low. Scientists mostly only counted the rise of the oceans because of expansion of warmer water then added on melting glaciers in the Alps and other temperate regions. Originally ice caps in Greenland and Antarctica were excluded, in case increased snow fall in winter was greater than the ice melt in summer. Real time measurements of ice lost in polar regions has changed that. Coastal inundation in places such as East Anglia, Florida, and the Nile and Mekong deltas is expected to be far worse and quicker than previously predicted. Food supplies are threatened. The melting is also irreversible. This makes Boris Johnson’s last act as prime minister to back a giant nuclear power plant on a low lying coast at Sizewell in Suffolk look a gamble. The builders, EDF, say there is no danger because the twin reactors will be built on a concrete raft seven metres above mean sea level, with a further surrounding wall to protect the nuclear island. But this concrete monolith will need to withstand sea level rise and storm surges for up to 200 years to protect future generations from its radioactive content."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/28/elizabeth-leonskaja-review-passion-power-and-purpose","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-28T14:20:58Z","webTitle":"Elizabeth Leonskaja review – passion, power and purpose","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/28/elizabeth-leonskaja-review-passion-power-and-purpose","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/aug/28/elizabeth-leonskaja-review-passion-power-and-purpose","fields":{"bodyText":"Pianist Elisabeth Leonskaja will shortly be playing at the Beethoven festival in Bonn, the composer’s birthplace, so it was something of a coup for the Machynlleth festival to have secured her for the same programme, namely the last three of his 32 sonatas, the triptych that constitutes a pinnacle of the repertoire. Machynlleth can claim to have been the ancient capital of Wales and, such was the calibre of this particular evening, the town certainly felt like a cultural capital. Leonskaja’s opening gesture was an indication of her seriousness of purpose, lifting the redundant music desk away from the instrument, placing it on the floor, disdaining the flutter of amused applause and, without further ado, launching into the E major sonata Op 109, immediately capturing its idiosyncratic balance between light pastoral flow and slow declamatory passion. The minor mode Prestissimo was almost martial in its fierceness, the perfect foil for the warm serenity of the theme and variations finale, albeit laced with fugal feist. The Tabernacle – formerly a chapel, yet with a surprising intimacy – has a fine acoustic and, in the A flat major sonata Op 110, Leonskaja again instinctively used it to her advantage, and to Beethoven’s, with a palette of tone-colours from gently muted to vibrant, and a similarly commanding dynamic range. Clarity of delineation and ease in every phrase allowed the structure to unfold organically. In the final sonata in C minor, Op 111, there were moments which seemed to be the summation of all the earlier C minor masterpieces, forceful yet also achieving a transcendent majesty. Leonskaja’s ability to produce the most powerful sound and allow it to resonate fully suggested an artist fully conscious of the privilege of giving aural expression to what the stone-deaf Beethoven had heard only in his extraordinary imagination. With barely a minute’s pause between sonatas Leonskaja was like a climber intent on pursuing her summit – this was not a leisurely affair, nor was it absolutely immaculate. That mattered not a jot. Here was innate pianism, with musical sensibilities and a daring honed by a lifetime of experience. She was cheered to the rafters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2023/feb/20/macbook-pro-m2-pro-review-apples-best-laptop-gets-more-power-and-battery-life","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-20T07:00:30Z","webTitle":"MacBook Pro M2 Pro review: Apple’s best laptop gets more power and battery life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/20/macbook-pro-m2-pro-review-apples-best-laptop-gets-more-power-and-battery-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/feb/20/macbook-pro-m2-pro-review-apples-best-laptop-gets-more-power-and-battery-life","fields":{"bodyText":"Apple’s M2 Pro chip upgrade for the MacBook Pro boosts performance and battery life in an already extremely capable machine – but it comes with a sizable price increase, making it particularly expensive outside the US. The starting price is £2,149 ($1,999/A$3,199), which is £250 (A$200) more than its predecessor despite being the same price in the US, which is partly down to weak currency rates. It is not as if the 2021 model was cheap, but pushing beyond the £2,000 mark for the new version significantly raises the barrier to entry. The outside of the machine remains untouched, with the winning combination of a brilliant fast, sharp and super-bright screen, class-leading keyboard and trackpad, a reasonable selection of ports and a premium look and feel befitting of its price. It was excellent in 2021 and remains so today. It runs macOS 13.2 Ventura like all recent Macs, including its desktop stablemate, the Mac mini. It generally runs similarly to previous versions and not too different to Windows, but has useful screen-sharing and proximity features, allowing you to use a recent iPad as a second screen or control it remotely. You can use an iPhone as a wireless webcam, which works really well but is less necessary because the FaceTime HD camera on the MacBook Pro is pretty good already. Specifications Screen: 14.2in mini LED (3024x1964; 254 ppi) ProMotion (120Hz) Processor: Apple M2 Pro or M2 Max RAM: 16, 32, 64 or 96GB Storage: 512GB, 1, 2, 4 or 8TB SSD Operating system: macOS 13.2 Ventura Camera: 1080p FaceTime HD camera Connectivity: wifi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, 3x USB 4/Thunderbolt 4, HDMI 2.1, SD card, headphones Dimensions: 221.2 x 312.6 x 15.5mm Weight: 1.6kg M2 Pro is faster and more efficient The new M2 Pro chip offers decent performance gains on the already very fast M1 Pro chips, with up to 14% improvement in CPU speed and up to 22% faster graphics in tests. That puts it alongside some of the best Intel and AMD laptop chips, but at considerably lower power consumption. The M2 Max chip is also available for those who need more graphics or power for specialist applications. Fitted with the M2 Pro, the laptop lasted about 10% longer on battery than its predecessor in my testing, managing more than 15 hours of light work such as word processing or browsing and about 12 hours of more demanding tasks such as editing batches of large images in Affinity Photo. That’s thoroughly impressive, outlasting all rivals by some margin. The battery reaches a full charge in just under 90 minutes, hitting 50% in about 30 minutes using Apple’s included 96W USB-C charger and MagSafe cable, but it can also charge via any of the USB ports. Sustainability The MacBook Pro is made of 30% recycled materials, including aluminium, rare earth elements, tin, gold and plastic. Apple breaks down the computer’s environmental impact in its report. The computer is generally repairable and has repair manuals available, and the battery can be replaced for £245 by Apple. Repair specialists iFixit praised the machine’s more repairable design but criticised Apple’s use of software locks on replacement parts. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Price The 14in MacBook Pro starts at £2,149 ($1,999/A$3,199) for an M2 Pro chip with 10-core CPU and 16-core GPU, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. Models with the 12-core CPU/19-core GPU M2 Pro cost from £2,499, while M2 Max models start at £3,149. The 16in MacBook Pro starts at £2,699 ($2,499/A$3,999). It is not possible to upgrade the RAM or storage after purchase. For comparison, the MacBook Air M2 starts at £1,249, while Windows laptops roughly equivalent to the new machines, such as the Dell XPS 15, cost about £1,950, the Razer Blade 14 is about £2,100 and Microsoft’s Surface Laptop Studio costs from £1,449. Verdict The 14in MacBook Pro is a truly excellent laptop with serious power and longer battery life than any of its competitors. Many of its parts are best in class and put together in a very easy to live with package. But it comes at a very high cost, and one that may be prohibitive even to those looking for a pro-grade workhorse – £2,149 buys an awful lot of machine elsewhere. Certainly for Apple consumers, it makes the £1,249 M2 MacBook Air all the more enticing at £900 less than the entry-level Pro, though still not exactly cheap. For those who need a Mac but don’t need the power and ports, there aren’t that many corners cut for the Air. Still, it is encouraging to see Apple continue to make progress with its own chips in increasing performance and energy efficiency hand in hand. Longer battery life is always welcome. Pros: powerful, very long battery life, fantastic miniLED ProMotion screen, plenty of ports and SD card slot, brilliant speakers, Touch ID, great keyboard and trackpad, MagSafe, 14in is a great size. Cons: no USB-A, no Face ID, no Centre Stage camera, RAM or SSD can not be upgraded after purchase, no Boot Camp/Windows support, very expensive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/04/scholz-china-germany-visit-lets-work-together-says-xi","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-04T16:05:32Z","webTitle":"China and Germany condemn Russian threat to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/04/scholz-china-germany-visit-lets-work-together-says-xi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/04/scholz-china-germany-visit-lets-work-together-says-xi","fields":{"bodyText":"Xi Jinping and Olaf Scholz have condemned Russia’s threat to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, with both leaders expressing their desire for the conflict to end. The Chinese president stressed the need for greater cooperation between China and Germany in what he referred to as “times of change and turmoil”, and said both leaders “jointly oppose the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons,” although he stopped short of criticising Russia or calling for the withdrawal of Russian troops. The German chancellor said Russia was in danger of “crossing a line” in the international community if it used atomic weapons, in what was the first meeting with his Chinese counterpart. Scholz’s inaugural one-day visit on Friday was the first by a leader of a G7 nation to China in three years, and was viewed as testing the waters of relations between Beijing and the west after years of mounting tensions, analysts say. Observers said Scholz’s visit was being viewed in China as a welcome development as the country’s leadership looks to consolidate its relations with the outside world after years of isolation during the pandemic. For his part, Scholz was looking to achieve greater market access at a time when the German economy is struggling with inflation and an imminent recession, largely fuelled by the energy crisis. Scholz defended his decision to travel to China with a group of industrial representatives, which has been viewed with controversy at home, telling journalists: “It is good and right that I am in Beijing today.” He said in time of crisis, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, bilateral meetings were all the more important. In a meeting with China’s outgoing premier, Li Keqiang, Scholz said he had urged Xi to use China’s influence as a permanent member of the UN security council on Russia to bring an end to the invasion of Ukraine. “I told president Xi that it is important for China to exercise its influence on Russia,” he said. During their meeting, which was held in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Xi said that as large nations with influence, China and Germany should work together all the more during “times of change and turmoil” for the sake of world peace, according to the state broadcaster CCTV. “As long as the principles of mutual respect, seeking common ground while reserving differences, exchanges and mutual learning, and win-win cooperation are upheld, the general direction of bilateral relations will not be deviated, and the pace of progress will be stable,” Xi was quoted as saying by CCTV. “At present, the international situation is complex and changeable. As influential powers, China and Germany should work together in times of change and chaos to make more contributions to world peace and development.” Over lunch Scholz told Xi it was important both leaders were meeting in person during tense times, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine creating problems for the rules-based global order, according to a Reuters reporter accompanying Scholz’s delegation. At a news conference after his meeting with Li, Scholz said he had raised the issue of Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory over which it will not exclude using weapons in order to bring it under its control. “Like the US and other countries, we are pursuing a one-China policy,” he said. “But I have made equally clear that any change in Taiwan’s status quo must be peaceful or by mutual consent.” The two leaders also discussed Europe-China relations, the climate crisis and global hunger, as well as how to develop China-Germany economic ties, which Scholz said had “become more difficult for German companies recently” because of China sealing off access to many of its market sectors. Li nominally has responsibility over China’s economy. According to German media who accompanied him, Scholz indirectly admonished China over its failures to protect minorities in China. He told Xi that human rights were universal, especially the rights of minorities and pledged to “want to remain in discussion” with China about the situation in the province of Xinjiang, which is allegedly home to hundreds of interment camps in which more than 1 million Uyghurs are believed to be held. China’s strict zero-Covid policy and growing tensions with the west have made it unfeasible for leaders of major western powers to visit China. Xi himself has only just resumed foreign trips. Scholz’s visit is probably a welcome development for China’s leadership, which will be looking to shore up relations with the outside world after the conclusion of the 20th party congress, where Xi consolidated his status as the core of the ruling Communist party. In the run-up to the visit, there had been criticism from within the EU and the German government coalition, mainly from the Green party and the Liberals.

Unveiling details of the proposed law, Shapps said ministers would consult during the progress of the bill on what minimum services levels would be required for fire, ambulance and transport services, including rail. The measures, which could lead to striking staff being sacked, will also affect health, education, border security and nuclear decommissioning. In these areas, Shapps said, the hope was to reach agreed minimum service levels “that mean that we don’t have to use that power in the bill”. Again, these were not set out. Explanatory notes for the bill, published after Shapps spoke, gave no details for what level of minimum services would be required. Under the law, the business secretary would be given the powers “to make regulations providing for levels of service where there are strikes in relevant services”. Employers must consult with unions on what this means in practice before a strike, the bill states. It also confirms that staff who breach minimum service levels will lose employment protections and could be sacked. Despite the government’s insistence that the planned law, which will apply to England, Scotland and Wales but not Northern Ireland, is not an attack on the right to strike, unions have labelled it as heavy-handed and likely to exacerbate industrial disputes rather than limit their impact. Mick Lynch, the general secretary of the RMT rail union, called the bill “an attack on human rights and civil liberties which we will oppose in the courts, parliament and the workplace”. Sharon Graham, the leader of Unite, called it “another dangerous gimmick from a government that should be negotiating to resolve the current crisis they have caused”. Introducing the as yet unpublished bill in the Commons, Shapps singled out unions representing ambulance crews, who strike again on Wednesday, for not setting out national minimum service levels. “While we absolutely believe in the right to strike, we’re duty bound to protect the lives and the livelihoods of the British people,” Shapps said. The new ambulance strike “will result in patchy emergency care for the British people – and this cannot continue”, he said. Shapps added: “We do not want to use this legislation. But we must ensure the safety of the British public.” The Unison trade union has rejected Shapps’ characterisation of arrangements for the ambulance strike as meaning there would not be sufficient coverage as “a lie”. Ambulance staff will stagger their industrial action over the course of the day to cover gaps, with none walking out for more than 12 hours and many doing so for no more than six hours. Responding in the Commons for Labour, the party’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, described the bill as a distraction from the wider problems of staff shortages and low pay that have prompted strikes in so many public areas. Rayner said that one of her constituents died recently while waiting for an ambulance: “That was not on a strike day. That is because of the disastrous chaos we have in the system under this Conservative government. His government offers no solution because they have caused the problem.” Shapps “knows the NHS cannot find the nurses that they need to work on the wards”, Rayner said. “He knows the trains don’t run even on non-strike days, such is the shortage of staff. So how can he seriously think that sacking thousands of key workers won’t just plunge our public services further into crisis?” The legislation showed, Rayner said, “a government that is out of ideas, out of time, and fast running out of sticking plasters; a government that is playing politics with nurses’ and teachers’ lives because they can’t stomach the cooperation and negotiation that’s needed. “We need negotiation, not legislation. So when is the minister going to do his job?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/03/what-happened-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-this-week-catch-up-with-the-must-read-news-and-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-02T18:00:05Z","webTitle":"What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week?

Kyiv says the attempt to retake ground is already under way but Russia has dismissed its prospects of success. Nataliya Humenyuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, announced on Monday that an offensive in Kherson – the only regional capital Russia has been able to secure since the war began – had begun. Oleksiy Arestovych, a senior adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukrainian troops had begun attacking Russian defences along the frontline and claimed they had broken through in several places. However two Ukrainian fighters on the frontlines in Kherson, who have oversight of events, described to Isobel Koshiw a situation that differed from the Ukrainian officials’ statements. According to them, fighting is taking place in Kherson region, but it is not the major counteroffensive being touted by Kyiv. Kherson has huge symbolic and practical significance and if Ukraine can entirely cut off enemy forces on the western bank of the Dnieper, they will have a realistic prospect of success, Archie Bland explains. Kyiv also needs to show that it can do more than resist the Russian advance; it can seize the initiative – thus shoring up the morale of its own population ahead of a grim winter and at the same time maintaining the support of western leaders. UN team leads mission to Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant A team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine on Thursday amid calls from Zelenskiy and the international community to demilitarise and safeguard the site from potential radiation disaster. “We are going to a war zone,” IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi, said ahead of the visit he described as a “technical mission” to prevent a nuclear accident at Europe’s largest atomic plant, Isobel Koshiw reported from Kyiv. In the days leading up to the visit, Ukraine accused Russia of deliberately shelling corridors along the pre-agreed route to deny the IAEA inspectors safe passage to the plant. Just hours before the team was due to cross from Ukrainian into Russian-held territory, the nearby city of Enerhodar came under fire, Jon Henley reported. A defiant Grossi told reporters: “We are not going anywhere. The IAEA is now there, it is at the plant and it is not moving – it’s going to stay there.” The nuclear chief confirmed after returning to Ukrainian-held territory that a group of IAEA experts had stayed behind at the plant and would provide an impartial, neutral and technically sound assessment of the situation. “It is obvious that the plant and physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times,” he added. “I worried, I worry and I will continue to be worried about the plant until we have a situation which is more stable, which is more predictable.” Children return to Ukrainian school trashed by occupying Russian forces Children and teachers gathered on the grass outside School No 2 in Borodianka on Thursday morning for the first day of the academic year, Isobel Koshiw writes from the town once occupied by Russian forces just north of Kyiv. There were speeches and a recital of the Ukrainian national anthem, and as is traditional the girls wore white scrunchies in their hair, the boys white shirts. They brought flowers to give to their teachers. But there will be no lessons in the classrooms of School No 2 this year. The invading soldiers used the school as a base and then trashed it as they left. Where enough students opted for in-person teaching and the schools are fit for use, school administrations have been preparing for the new academic year by outfitting basements as shelters and training teachers on what to do in case of an attack. All children who attend in person are told to carry an emergency bag with a change of clothes, any medicine they may need, a note from their parents and, for the younger children, a favourite toy. Putin: trapped and desperate Russia’s president is trapped and desperate. Will his friends in the west rescue him, Simon Tisdall asks. Putin keeps understandably schtum about his “special military operation”. But indefinite stalemate is not what he expected and an endless military quagmire is not a scenario he can afford. Slow-burn western sanctions corrode his economy and his military’s manpower and materiel are steadily depleted. So what are his options? As pressure on him grows to produce a breakthrough, Putin may well decide his best option is to raise the cost of the war to Ukraine’s backers in the context of rising anxiety over Europe’s energy and cost of living crises, largely caused by the invasion and Kremlin cuts to gas supplies. Mikhail Gorbachev, Soviet leader who ended cold war, dies aged 91 Meanwhile in Russia, Andrew Roth and Luke Harding reported the death of Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader whose reforms led to the unlooked for break-up of his own country, and to the demise of communism across central and eastern Europe. Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, died in Moscow aged 91 after a “difficult and protracted illness”, Russian news agencies cited hospital officials as saying on Tuesday. He will be associated with his attempts to modernise and to improve the Soviet Union, a process that he ultimately lost control of, leading to the country’s collapse. In his last years, Gorbachev was a paradoxical figure. Abroad, he was viewed as the hero of the cold war, whose actions – or lack of them – ushered in a freer world. In Russia he was largely reviled and unloved, an unperson at best, a traitor at worst, Pjotr Sauer explains. The Kremlin appeared unsure how to mark Gorbachev’s death this week, issuing a statement saying Putin would not attend the funeral or the public farewell ceremony, in what will be seen as an extraordinary snub by the Russian president. However Putin did visit the open coffin of the former Soviet leader on Thursday morning, leaving flowers at the mourning hall of Moscow’s central clinical hospital.

On Thursday the opposition leader, Chris Minns, will announce that the party will re-commit to establishing the “great koala national park” on the NSW north coast, which could see an area of about 300,000 hectares of key habitat for the native species protected from logging. The park, which Labor has promised in the past two state elections, is likely to anger the timber and logging industry, which has previously claimed it would cost the state thousands of jobs. Other estimates claim the park would add about $1bn to the state’s economy over 15 years. Labor has sought to head off criticism by promising an initial $80m to first carry out consultation and an independent economic assessment of the park’s “impact on local jobs and communities”. Environment groups have long called for the park, which would be created by linking about 140,000 hectares of existing national parks with about 170,000 hectares of state forest. The land is estimated to be home to about 20% of the state’s wild koala population. Labor said it won’t commit to the size of the park immediately – nor the potential cost of compensation for the logging industry as a result of the transfer of state forest land – but will use “expert scientific advice” to guide its establishment. In February last year Australia’s koala population was officially listed as endangered, a step environmental groups said came after a decade-long failure to address habitat destruction since the animal was first listed as threatened in 2012. In 2020, a NSW parliamentary inquiry found the species would be extinct in the state by 2050 unless governments took urgent action to protect its habitat. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Minns said he wanted to turn the animal’s “grim trajectory around”. “I don’t accept that one of our most loved and iconic native species could become extinct here in just 28 years’ time,” he said. “By protecting the places these koalas live, and by working closely with all stakeholders, we can ensure we bring these incredible creatures back from the brink.” Labor will hope the announcement also shifts attention to the government’s record on the animal. The Coalition faced an existential threat in 2020 when former deputy premier John Barilaro threatened to move the Nationals to the crossbench over a land clearing bill. That conflict threatened to rear itself again in November last year, when the Nationals proposed new legislation that would strip councils of their powers to regulate native forestry operations on private land. The bill was quickly dropped after a revolt from moderate Liberal party MPs. The animosity resulting from the battle over land clearing within the Coalition led former MP Catherine Cusack to publish text messages from former premier Gladys Berejiklian which she said showed a “deal” had been done with the Nationals to allow for weaker land clearing laws. “After 12 years, six environment ministers, the weakening of environmental protections and koala wars between the Liberals and Nationals, koalas are now listed as endangered,” Labor’s environment spokesperson Penny Sharpe said. On Thursday Labor will also announce that it will transfer ownership of a series of wildlife corridors in Woronora Heights in Sydney’s south from Sydney Water to the National Parks and Wildlife Services. The water authority caused local outrage in 2021 when it presented plans to subdivide the land for development despite evidence it contained koala habitat. Those plans were shelved late last year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/18/what-are-european-countries-doing-to-cut-power-consumption","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-18T04:30:42Z","webTitle":"What are European countries doing to cut power consumption?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/18/what-are-european-countries-doing-to-cut-power-consumption","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/18/what-are-european-countries-doing-to-cut-power-consumption","fields":{"bodyText":"Paris is switching off the Eiffel Tower lights an hour early, Milan has turned off public fountains, and Hanover is offering gym users cold rather than hot showers in an effort to combat potential energy shortages this winter. At the same time, the public are being encouraged to do their bit by avoiding using household appliances between 4pm and 7pm, stock up on blankets and slow down their driving. One global retail chain is encouraging staff to change their behaviours: to use stairs instead of lifts, to use energy-saving apps at home, and unplug devices rather than leaving them on standby. The UK, by contrast, has blocked a £15m campaign encouraging the public to conserve energy, with the government arguing that the country is “not a nanny state”. But across Europe, governments and municipal authorities have responded to calls to reduce power consumption and reach an EU target of shaving 15% off energy consumption by next March. All member states are reducing heating in public buildings by one degree to 19C, but some have gone further. France The Eiffel Tower lights are being turned off more than an hour early, shaving 4% off energy costs as the city responds to the government call to reduce fuel usage. The government has also launched a major communication campaign, “Every gesture counts”, encouraging individuals and industry to do their bit. Luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, which owns more than 500 stores including brands such as Christian Dior, Givenchy and Tiffany, and supermarket chains LeClerc and Carrefour are turning the lights off in their shops three hours early. Workers are also being encouraged into “new energy consumption behaviours” such as using stairs instead of lifts, not using printers, and unplugging computers and electric cars. At home, people are being asked to keep the heating at 19C or lower in living rooms and kitchens (17C in bedrooms), drop boiler temperatures to 55C, use energy-intensive appliances such as dishwashers and washing machines during off-peak hours, and turn standby mode on devices including TVs and wifi routers off when not being used. Households that do so will be rewarded with a “sobriety bonus” (details to be announced), as will commuters who join a car pool. Public building managers have been told to switch to LED bulbs, turn off hot water boilers unless they are essential, and not heat offices above 19C. Sports complexes must lower their heating by two degrees and public swimming pools their water temperature by one degree, while street lights and signage will be dialled down in intensity, switched on for shorter periods, and where possible switched off altogether between 1am and 6am. Companies and public sector employers have been instructed to organise home working so that their premises can be closed altogether for three or four days at a time, and people with cars provided by public sector employers must limit their speed. Owners of private buildings are encouraged to reduce thermostats to 19C while occupied and lower them further to 16C overnight and 8C if they are not occupied for more than two days, as on bank holiday weekends. Ukraine Ukraine is not just fighting a war against Russia, but an energy crisis in one of the coldest countries in Europe. While the EU drops its thermostats to 19C, Ukraine’s authorities are talking about reducing central heating in building to four degrees lower than normal, between 17C and 18C. People have been advised to stock up on blankets and warm clothes for when outdoor temperatures fall to and below the -10C winter average. Spain Under a government decree, temperatures can be set no higher than 19C in public buildings. The new rules do not apply to households, but people are being encouraged to follow suit. Shops must also switch off window display lighting from 10pm and any air-conditioned or heated premises must have an automatic door-closing mechanism installed to avoid energy waste. Spain, which is not as dependent on Russian energy supplies as many other EU countries, has agreed to a 7%-8% reduction in gas use in solidarity with other EU countries. The measures will remain in place until November next year. Belgium Staff have been told not to grumble after the thermostat at the EU council of ministers HQ and Europa building, the site of EU summits, was reduced to 19C. “Compensating for the lower thermostat setting by bringing in individual electrical heaters is obviously out of the question,” says an internal memo that advises staff to “consider coming to work with an extra sweater” and not hesitate to wear it because “energy matters more than our traditional dress code”. The Europa lantern – the internal oval-shaped structure in the Council HQ known as the space egg – will be turned off, while the vast atrium will be switched to a chilly 14C. MEPs have also reopened their longstanding campaign against the European parliament’s monthly commute to Strasbourg. The German Christian Democrat MEP Peter Liese has called on parliamentary authorities to abandon the Strasbourg trip until April, because “if we ask everyone to save energy, it is not responsible to heat two buildings and make unnecessary trips”. Ireland A “reduce your use” government campaign is urging the public to use cookers, tumbledryers, washing machines and kettles efficiently and, where possible, outside peak hours of 4pm to 7pm. The government of the car-dependent country is also asking motorists to drive more slowly, maintain tyre pressure, and drive smoothly to conserve energy consumption. It is also encouraging them to switch one journey a week to walking, cycling or public transport. Ireland delayed switching on heating at the Dáil. In September several members of parliament complained about the cold, but the staff who run the complex said they wished to set an example. In an email, managers said the heating would not be turned on until 3 October at the earliest. After four days of setting an example, the heating was switched on. Germany Public monuments, including the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, public buildings and advertising billboards can only be illuminated between 4pm and 10 pm, except during cultural festivals. An annual light show festival in Berlin went ahead this week, but the organisers said they had managed to reduce the consumption of electricity by 75% compared with last year. Heating in corridors in public buildings will be switched off. The maximum temperature in public administration offices is 19C. There is no binding maximum temperature for homes, but privately owned swimming pools must no longer be heated with electricity or gas unless “urgently necessary for therapeutic use or to avoid damages to the pool technology”. Temperatures at public pools have also been lowered. Some municipalities have gone further and turned off instant hot water. Hanover said hot water would not be available for handwashing or showers in public buildings, swimming pool showers, sport halls and gyms. Italy Operation Thermostat this spring already led to a number of energy-saving measures, including the switching-off of public fountains. The Italian government is asking homeowners to turn central heating down by 1C and to turn it off for an extra hour every day. It is also encouraging people to take shorter showers, to use dishwashers and washing machines only when fully loaded, and not to leave home appliances on standby. Netherlands The Dutch government is advising households and business on measures to cut consumption, including turning down heating by 1C."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/jan/28/toy-trends-2023-lego-traitors-board-game","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-28T11:00:18Z","webTitle":"Toy trends for 2023:  from Lego flower power to Traitors the board game","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/28/toy-trends-2023-lego-traitors-board-game","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/28/toy-trends-2023-lego-traitors-board-game","fields":{"bodyText":"With its character parades featuring Paddington Bear, Paw Patrol and Pikachu, the annual UK toy industry beano has a carnival atmosphere but is actually a serious business as retail buyers select the sets, dolls and games we will play with in 2023. Toy sales slumped by more than £100m last year, according to figures released to coincide with this week’s British Toy and Hobby Association (BTHA) fair in London, meaning the buyers there were desperate to identify the next big toy or trend for kids and, increasingly, the kidults who buy £1bn worth of toys for themselves. Melissa Symonds, an analyst at the market researcher NPD, says toy sales were hit by the cost of living crisis. Total sales fell back 3% to £3.6bn while the number of products sold dropped 6% as parents shunned cheaper impulse buys. There was also no escape from inflation, with the average selling price up 3% to £10.54. “We’re not expecting huge growth this year because the economy is still uncertain,” Symonds says. “People are still going to be price-conscious … but will still want to distract themselves or their kids. That is something toys has over other categories – there is always an element of joy.” Kidults rule In 2022 the sweet spot was the kidult (buyers aged 12 and over) market, which is still growing and now equates to almost 30% of UK toy sales. After rediscovering childhood passions during lockdown, adults are opting to spend on Lego and collectible toys rather than nights out. The maker of plastic bricks continues to target this group with new sets and themes such as the Botanical Collection, which, with sets such as a £45 dried flower centrepiece, analysts say is aimed at women. Playmobil is also tapping into nostalgia for childhood favourites, with sets devoted to Asterix and the 80s TV favourite Magnum, PI. The latter, due out in April, includes a Ferrari 308 GTS Quattrovalvole and a figure complete with Hawaiian shirt and Tom Selleck’s trademark moustache. Disney is 100 Despite the grim picture for toy town as a whole, in 2022 sales of licensed toys were actually up 5.5% thanks to spin-offs from classics such as Star Wars and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. These kinds of toys make up almost a third of sales, and analysts are predicting another “good year” because of the welter of merchandise – from dolls, cuddly toys and Lego to even a Rubik’s Cube – celebrating characters and films from the Disney archive as it turns 100. This year’s Barbie film is also set to provide a shot in the arm for Mattel’s veteran doll brand, which is enjoying a renaissance. Old favourites return Sesame Street, Paddington Bear and Wallace and Gromit … there were lots of familiar names on the list of 25 “hero” toys of the year produced by the BTHA for the event. A £35 cuddly singing Elmo to help preschoolers crack potty training garnered a lot of attention, while for 80s kids the £20 Care Bear provides a blast from the past. Honey, I shrunk the toys The micro toy trend manages to sate collectors and small budgets at the same time. Analysts point to the Bitty Pop! toy range, which debuted at the London show. It offers tiny versions of the popular Funko Pop! figures, and the first wave features characters from Harry Potter and, of course, Disney. The Bitty Pop! figures will go sale in the summer in a four-pack costing £13. Plush (soft) toys are huge While other toys were left on the shelf in 2022, sales of plush toys jumped 29%. They are expected to be popular this year too because of Squishmallows, the cuddly toy brand that is huge on TikTok. Are you a ‘faithful’? Britons rediscovered board games during the coronavirus pandemic and have kept on playing, with murder mystery and escape room games growing in popularity. With millions hooked on the BBC’s recent hit show The Traitors, the board game is expected to be one of the biggest toys of the year, with predictions we will all be hosting Traitors nights come Christmas. The game, costing £30, is due out in the autumn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/24/when-you-hear-the-four-minute-warning-whatever-happened-to-britains-nuclear-bunkers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-24T10:00:25Z","webTitle":"‘When you hear the four-minute warning’ … Whatever happened to Britain’s nuclear bunkers?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/24/when-you-hear-the-four-minute-warning-whatever-happened-to-britains-nuclear-bunkers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/24/when-you-hear-the-four-minute-warning-whatever-happened-to-britains-nuclear-bunkers","fields":{"bodyText":"Michael Parrish has a “wedding guest list” of people he will allow into his three-level, 125ft (38 metre)-deep concrete bunker in the event of a nuclear attack. Situated below an inconspicuous bungalow in Brentwood, Essex, the Kelvedon Hatch bunker was built on Parrish’s grandfather’s land in the 1950s and maintained as secret regional government headquarters throughout the cold war. After it was decommissioned in 1992, the Parrishes bought back the bunker – for more than 20 years, it has been a tourist attraction and a sleepover location for Boy Scouts. Today, it is also potentially a lifeline. “We have our own water, we have our own electricity, we have our own toilets, because one day I may need it,” says Parrish, 75, wearing a burgundy jumper with the words “secret nuclear bunker” embroidered in yellow on the left breast. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, 15 people have inquired about hiring a space in the bunker in the event of nuclear war, but Parrish wants to charge £500,000 a head (a bargain, he says, if you spend 10 to 20 years down there avoiding nuclear fallout). Who will he bring in for free? “What it amounts to is a wedding list: you have your family, you have your sister. Do you have your sister’s boyfriend? Probably. Do you have his parents? No,” Parrish says. He has light brown eyes, coiffed grey hair and a serious mouth that betrays no hint of a joke. The last 20 or so spaces in Parrish’s bunker, he says, will be reserved for “young, 25-year-olds – of either sex, before you think I’ve got this all wrong. Because you’ve got to think of the world.” Once upon a time, not all that long ago, operational nuclear bunkers were dotted up and down Britain, from sprawling complexes like Parrish’s to underground “monitoring posts”, which were less than five metres long and were used by the Royal Observer Corps (ROC) during the cold war. What has happened to all of these subterranean safe havens? In an age of renewed nuclear threat, what is the bunker status quo? How many have been maintained and how many have fallen into disrepair? More pressingly, what chance do you and I stand of getting in? With help-yourself audio guides and an honesty box ticketing system, it is easy to feel like the last woman alive in Parrish’s bunker. When I visit in early November, I initially don’t see another soul (unless you count the waxworks – a toothsome Maggie Thatcher sits behind real radio controls). It’s an eerie time capsule with a musty tang in the air. You might technically be able to survive for years down here, but would you want to? “My wife is quite adamant that she wouldn’t,” Parrish says. In Cheshire and in St Andrews, two other former secret nuclear bunkers have also become visitor attractions. In Wiltshire, billions of pounds of wine is stored by a private company in a former MoD bunker, while an old command centre in Essex has been converted into luxury flats. The Kingsway telephone exchange, a second world war air-raid shelter and cold war communications facility built under the tube in London, is still owned by BT, which tried to sell it in 2008. A spokesperson said the building is not operational and is not being used for anything, not even storage. More than 1,500 ROC monitoring posts were built across the country from the mid-1950s. Designed to house three people, these mini-shelters were places where volunteers could measure nuclear fallout and broadcast messages to the public after an attack. Many of these bunkers have fallen into disrepair, but some have been bought by members of the public – in March, a bunker on sale in Norfolk for £25,000 received 200 inquiries in three days. Russ McLean, owner of the listings website Unique Property Bulletin – which features numerous shelters for sale – says: “Sadly we have seen a significant uptick in the demand for nuclear bunkers,” since Russia invaded Ukraine. But Luke Bennett, associate professor of natural and built environments at Sheffield Hallam University, describes these bunkers as “tiny underground sheds” and says they are difficult to renovate into appealing spaces. “You wouldn’t really want to sleep in a cold, dank, windowless, underground shed.” He says these buildings are mostly bought by “bunker hunter” hobbyists (one in Perthshire was briefly converted into a holiday home, but guests had to do without electricity or running water). “There aren’t really any facilities in the UK that are ripe for reactivating,” says Bennett, whose former work as a lawyer saw him selling off old government bunkers. Beyond the ROC’s “underground sheds”, Bennett estimates that there were no more than 50 regional government bunkers in the UK. In 2021, he traced the afterlife of four that had been built in the late 80s and found that only one – in Ballymena in Northern Ireland – would be somewhat usable in event of a modern attack. “The nuclear bunkers constructed in the cold-war era have fallen pretty much into ruin,” he says. “Even the most recently built ones are pretty much beyond use now because they’ve had their life support equipment stripped out or they haven’t been maintained over the years.” Bennett believes most people would be surprised to learn how few shelters the government built during the cold war. While countries across the globe constructed shelters after the detonation of the first nuclear weapon in 1945, some invested in infrastructure more than others. A programme of “bunkerisation” in Albania between the 1960s and 80s led to the construction of more than 750,000 military bunkers. In 1976, Switzerland completed the largest civilian fallout shelter in the world, the Sonnenberg tunnel, which could house 20,000 people. Since 1963, Switzerland has been constitutionally obliged to provide shelter space for every citizen, meaning that, by law, apartment blocks must be fitted with shelters. Today, the country has more bunker spaces than it does residents: its population of 8.6 million can access 365,000 shelters that have room for nearly 9 million people. In the US, iconic black and yellow shelter signs sprung up around the country after the second world war, signposting where citizens could shelter during a nuclear attack. In 1955, the Federal Civil Defense Administration instructed people to construct fallout shelters in their own homes and gardens, and there were more than 200,000 private shelters in the country by 1965. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin allegedly has a hi-tech bunker in Siberia complete with an energy substation that could power a small city. It is rumoured that wealthy Russians are buying and building nuclear bunkers, while in October, what appeared to be a leaked document showed an order for a bomb shelter-turned-car park to be cleared out and brought up to scratch. The country purportedly has just under 17,000 bomb shelters. By contrast, “the UK never really had a big, sincere commitment to spending a lot of money on building voluminous underground facilities that large numbers of people could sit out a nuclear war in,” Bennett says. The ROC’s 1,500 shelters were built from 1956 onwards, but they were only designed to house Royal Observer Corps volunteers, not regular civilians. Although new shelters are undoubtedly being constructed, this is on a need-to-know basis, so it is difficult to gauge the extent of recent bunker building. Of course, the country’s VIPs would always have a place to stay. While it is unclear who exactly will go where to survive nuclear Armageddon, the civil defence historian Nathan Hazlehurst says: “Key members of central government, the military and royal family will have access to bunkers, along with those staff needed to run the country post-attack.” Hazlehurst, who works as an emergency preparedness manager in the NHS, says the MoD has maintained “a number” of bunkers across the country, although naturally information about them is top secret. Some snippets of information have leaked out. An underground bunker at RAF Boulmer, in Northumberland, was renovated in 2002. A journalist gained access to an RAF bunker in Buckinghamshire in 2015 and described it as “a functional and complex building”. The government’s permanent joint headquarters in Northwood, north-west London, has its own bunker that is permanently staffed by security. Below Whitehall is the £126.3m defence crisis management centre known as Pindar, which is believed to be connected to Downing Street via tunnels. David Moore is a London-based photographer who was permitted access to an underground government crisis command centre in the early 00s. Many have speculated that his resulting photograph collection, 2008’s The Last Things, depicts Pindar, though he is not at liberty to say. “It’s quite a surreal environment in some ways and ordinary in others,” Moore says. Among other things, his photographs depict a concrete entrance way with a small, green “To bomb shelter area” sign pointing down some stairs; an emergency briefing room that – bar a lectern – could be any other office; a document shredder; a green-screened broadcast studio; giant red metal doors; and some art and ornaments that were seemingly placed to make the whole thing feel more homely. “It’s a very functional space which is difficult to navigate and was at the time sparsely populated,” Moore says. He says “everything was sort of humming” on standby. At various points on his visit, Moore says, the air quality was “not so great” (incidentally, most of the complex had no smell, though some areas near generators smelled “industrial”). “The thing about the space is even when you’re in it, you don’t know specifically what it’s for,” Moore says. Others who have gained access to special and secret spaces are members of exploration society Subterranea Britannica. In the 1950s the government built an alternative seat of power in Corsham, Wiltshire, but the so-called Burlington bunker, or central government war headquarters, was decommissioned in 2004. In 2013, Martin Dixon, a 40-year member of Subterranea Britannica, was allowed to visit. (The MoD still manages much of the underground space, but for security and health and safety reasons, the public are no longer allowed access.) “It wasn’t in tremendous condition, it really wasn’t maintained,” says Dixon, 67, who has visited more than 1,000 human-made underground spaces. At Corsham, he was able to see ventilation systems, standby generators and a telephone exchange. “I think because the cold war never happened it isn’t as chilling as visiting sites that were active during the second world war,” Dixon says. “A parachute that hasn’t been used is a parachute, whereas one that saved someone’s life somehow acquires a greater poignancy.” It remains to be seen whether Corsham will earn that poignancy in the coming years. In March, a senior adviser to the Cabinet Office told the i newspaper that the UK is “totally unprepared” to advise the public about nuclear attacks; the government website currently says that a new “emergency alerts” system is expected to launch in autumn 2022. Hazlehurst says that if threats become more tangible, then there needs to be greater education of the public, although he does not believe the government should build any more bunkers. “Though having infrastructure is important, it should only form a small part of the whole. Having trained personnel and coherent, workable plans across the country is more important,” he says. He adds that the pandemic has prompted some form of preparation: local authorities took on roles – “such as food distribution, body storage, and liaison with health and uniformed services” – that would be similar in the event of nuclear war. “Covid and other incidents have shown the real value of letting local authorities coordinate the response locally with central assistance,” Hazlehurst says. Does that mean nuclear survival is yet another postcode lottery? Hazlehurst says some councils have teams of emergency planners while others leave emergency planning to staff with additional roles. If you don’t live near a former bunker – and don’t have £500,000 spare to bunk with Parrish – then your best bet after a nuclear explosion is to stay inside and if possible get down to a basement, he says. Perhaps – somewhat damningly – the smartest thing you can do to prepare for a nuclear war right now is make friends with someone like Parrish – good friends, that is, the kind he would invite to his wedding. Still, you might have time on your side. “One of the first school groups we had, 20-odd years ago, one of the little kids described it as an upside down Norman castle,” Parrish says of his Kelvedon Hatch bunker. “And I thought that was absolutely right: it’s not going to fall down. It’s 10ft-thick reinforced walls, there’s no rot. It’s going to be here in a thousand years’ time.” If Parrish does manage to survive a nuclear attack, he jokes – although, actually, it’s hard to tell if he is joking – he may emerge from his bunker as king of Essex."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/dec/14/price-of-gas-and-power-falls-in-uk-as-continental-energy-eases-supply-pressures","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-14T16:06:11Z","webTitle":"Britons save £3m by using power-hungry appliances at quieter times","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/dec/14/price-of-gas-and-power-falls-in-uk-as-continental-energy-eases-supply-pressures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/dec/14/price-of-gas-and-power-falls-in-uk-as-continental-energy-eases-supply-pressures","fields":{"bodyText":"Britons have saved almost £3m by using tumble dryers and other power-hungry devices at quieter times, under a scheme that aims to reduce the strain on electricity networks, National Grid has said. The electricity system operator (ESO) launched an initiative last month to incentivise consumers and businesses to reduce their energy use, by running appliances such as washing machines, dishwashers and tumble dryers before or after particular designated periods when demand was expected to be heavy. National Grid said on Wednesday the “demand flexibility service” had delivered more than 780 megawatt (MW) hours of demand reduction, and £2.8m in savings over five test periods since the scheme launched last month. More than 1m households and firms had signed up to participate, it said. Customers are normally given 24 hours notice to shift their power usage from a peak period – typically 4pm to 7pm. Savings are passed on via energy suppliers to customers who have signed up. Craig Dyke, the head of national control at the ESO, said: “Delivering the first of the demand flexibility service test events is a major milestone in the evolution of consumer flexibility in the UK. This service successfully proves that consumers up and down the country are standing by to get involved in flexibility solutions.” Separately, gas and power prices fell on Wednesday in signs that the strain on the UK and Europe’s energy supplies was easing despite the icy weather. A marked increase in nuclear output from power stations in France and hydroelectric power in southern Europe has lifted pressure on electricity supplies across northern Europe. The UK price for gas for delivery on Thursday fell 4% at 332p a therm, while month-ahead prices were down 5.6% at 322p a therm. The price of power, which reached a record £675 a megawatt-hour on the Epex Spot SE exchange this week, fell to £353 in a volatile market. Power prices for delivery on Thursday fell nearly 7% in Germany and about 5% in France. Power prices had soared as the freezing weather forced Britons to increase their heating use, pushing up demand for energy despite high bills. The cold weather combined with a period of low wind, reducing the production of Britain’s windfarms to close to zero. Emergency power units at Drax in North Yorkshire were put on standby on Monday but ultimately not used. Live data from ESOon Wednesday showed wind accounting for 27% of electricity generation, behind gas with 47% and ahead of nuclear at 13%. Separately, French nuclear output has ramped up in recent days and is expected to improve through the week as four more nuclear reactors, which were out of action for maintenance, are due to return. There have been concerns over power shortages this winter in the UK and Europe amid the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, the improving weather and resilience of the system so far has brought some encouragement. Analysts at RBC investment bank said: “Despite this grim scenario for the week, we could see that the electricity system is coping relatively well with the situation, albeit power prices suffered a significant increase. “Despite the increase in gas demand on cold weather and low wind resource, we could see how gas storage levels are doing better even this week on any single day v the same day last year.” The rise in prices will have increased the cost of the government’s energy price guarantee scheme, which aims to cushion the blow of rising wholesale costs. The energy regulator is pushing for a cap on how much power stations can charge National Grid for backup electricity. Ofgem wants to tighten rules to prevent “excessive” profits and intends to publish proposals early next year, the Daily Telegraph reports. The Grid spent more than £27m paying power stations to crank up supplies at short notice on Monday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/dec/14/thousands-still-without-power-in-shetland-as-cold-blast-bites-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-14T09:59:52Z","webTitle":"2,800 still without power in Shetland as cold blast bites UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/14/thousands-still-without-power-in-shetland-as-cold-blast-bites-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/dec/14/thousands-still-without-power-in-shetland-as-cold-blast-bites-uk","fields":{"bodyText":"Thousands have been without power in Shetland for a second night as Britain’s infrastructure continues to struggle with sub-zero temperatures. The Met Office has extended a yellow warning for snow and ice to Friday in northern Scotland and north-east England. The Scottish government declared a major incident on Tuesday after heavy snow left thousands of homes in Shetland without power on Monday evening. About 2,800 still have no electricity, and engineers described the “concentrated and explosive weather event” as the worst they had seen since Christmas 1995. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) was working to restore supply but it was not expected to be fully restored until the end of the week. More engineers were due to arrive in Shetland on the ferry from Aberdeen on Wednesday to help restore power. An SSEN spokesperson, Graeme Keddie, said: “Firstly, I’d like to apologise to those customers still without power and reassure them that we are making every effort to get to them.” He told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland that the company had reconnected 1,000 homes on Tuesday and continued to make progress. “We’ve got 15 additional line crews coming over on this morning’s freight ferry and more by helicopter, so that will make a real difference to restoration efforts,” he said. “This has been a very concentrated and explosive weather event on Shetland which was far more severe than forecast. The local teams have said this is the worst they’ve seen since 1995 over the Christmas period.” Snow and ice have been causing disruption on the roads since the start of the week. The RAC breakdown service recorded its busiest day on record on Monday, going to the assistance of about 12,000 drivers. Braemar in Aberdeenshire was the coldest place in the UK for the second night in a row on Tuesday, recording a temperature of -17.3C. The Met Office said on Twitter: “It will be another cold start this Wednesday morning with warnings for snow, ice and strong winds active across the UK.” The Met Office spokesperson Becky White said: “There will be a risk of ice across the country over the next few days, but particularly tonight.” Commenting on the latest yellow warning in northern Scotland and north-east England, White said some areas could see up to 10cm of fresh snow on higher ground, with 1-4cm at lower levels. In Sheffield, engineers reported that they still had just over 100 households left to reconnect to gas on Tuesday evening. Nearly 2,000 homes in the city lost supplies 11 days earlier when a burst water main filled the local gas network with more than a million litres of water. Snow and ice warnings were in place in the south-west of England until 10am on Wednesday. The region could see as much as 10cm of snow on higher ground such as Dartmoor and Exmoor. Ice warnings were also in place in for eastern England and northern parts of Northern Ireland, including Belfast, until midday on Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/10/winter-power-cuts-in-uk-less-likely-says-national-grid-boss","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-10T10:56:31Z","webTitle":"Winter power cuts in UK unlikely, says National Grid boss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/10/winter-power-cuts-in-uk-less-likely-says-national-grid-boss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/10/winter-power-cuts-in-uk-less-likely-says-national-grid-boss","fields":{"bodyText":"National Grid expects there to be “sufficient generation” to avoid rolling power cuts this winter, with Britain’s supplies boosted by the return of a crucial electricity link to France that was hit by fire. The power networks owner said last month that Britain should be able to meet its energy needs this winter but could experience rolling power cuts in a worst-case scenario if Russia cut off gas supplies into Europe. Its chief executive, John Pettigrew, said on Thursday that the outlook had not changed, and the mild weather so far this winter was a positive for the energy picture. “What we have seen is pretty mild weather, which has led the Europeans to probably put more gas into storage than they originally anticipated. My understanding is the storage in Europe now is pretty much full,” he said. Last year the Sellindge converter station in Kent was forced to shut down a high-voltage cable that brings electricity from France after a huge fire. Half of its 2,000 gigawatt (GW) capacity was knocked out by the fire. Pettigrew said 500 megawatts would be restored this month and the remaining 500MW in December. “So by the time we get to the peak of the winter, the full 2GW will be available from the French interconnector, which I’m delighted about,” he said. National Grid reported a 50% rise in operating profits to £2.24bn in the six months to 30 September, buoyed up by extra revenues from its acquisition of the network operator Western Power Distribution. Its earnings were also boosted by a “strong performance” in its New York and New England business, plus the insurance proceeds from the Sellindge fire. Pettigrew stressed that the company did not produce or sell energy and was not recording the windfall profits of some oil and gas producers. Rishi Sunak and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, are reportedly considering extending the windfall tax on those firms and curbing the revenues of electricity generators. Pettigrew said he understood Sunak and Hunt’s focus on tax and spending “to balance the UK plc books” but said: “What we need is a stable policy regime, a stable regulatory regime and a stable financial regime.” National Grid increased its investment target to £40bn by 2026, up from a previous goal of £30bn to £35bn. The firm said £29bn of this would be in “the decarbonisation of energy networks”. “Connecting renewables and decarbonisation is an absolute focus. That’s a huge investment programme, £1m an hour, every single hour of every single day, 365 days a year,” he said. “Connecting clean energy at scale and pace will bring down energy bills for customers and increase energy security.” Pettigrew said the “vast majority” of suppliers in the UK had now signed up to a scheme launched last week to incentivise households to shift their power usage outside peak times this winter. The Guardian reported last week that E.ON, EDF and the British Gas owner, Centrica, had said they planned to participate in the scheme, which was first piloted by Octopus Energy. “We’re really pleased with the take-up. It will continue to grow as we move through the winter,” Pettigrew said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/08/russia-ukraine-war-un-secretary-general-calls-for-inspectors-to-be-allowed-access-to-nuclear-plant-as-russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-08T17:59:23Z","webTitle":"World Bank announces additional $4.5bn in Ukraine aid – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/08/russia-ukraine-war-un-secretary-general-calls-for-inspectors-to-be-allowed-access-to-nuclear-plant-as-russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/08/russia-ukraine-war-un-secretary-general-calls-for-inspectors-to-be-allowed-access-to-nuclear-plant-as-russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-live","fields":{"bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is 9pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s top stories: The United States will provide an additional $4.5 billion (£3.7 bn) to Ukraine’s government, bringing its total budgetary support since Russia’s February invasion to $8.5 billion (£7 bn), the US Agency for International Development has announced. The funding, coordinated with the US Treasury Department through the World Bank, will go to the Ukraine government in tranches, beginning with a $3 billion (£2.5 bn) disbursement in August, USAid, the Agency for International Development, said. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has accused Ukraine of taking “Europe hostage” over the situation at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The plant is occupied by Russian forces, and each side has claimed the other has caused damage to the complex by shelling it. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been seeking to inspect it. Zakharova said: “The leaders of the United Nations and the IAEA, over and over again, do not dare to directly name the source of the threat. They are demonstrating their unwillingness to point the finger at Kyiv.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new international sanctions on Moscow for “nuclear terror”. The UN nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to all military action near the plant after it was hit by shelling on Saturday night, causing one of the reactors to shut down and creating a “very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station is operating normally according to reports from Yevgeniy Balitsky, head of the Russian-installed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom called for the plant to be made a military-free zone, and said there should be a team of peacekeepers present at the site. Ukraine conducted long-range strikes on Russian troop bases and two key bridges across the Dnieper River overnight. The strikes hit the only two crossings Russia has to the pocket of southern Ukrainian territory it has occupied on the western bank of the river, said Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command. “The results are rather respectable, hits on the Antonivskyi and Kakhovskyi bridges,” she said on television. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the pro-Russian administration imposed on occupied Kherson told Interfax “The equipment of the builders who are repairing the Antonivskiy Bridge burned down, there are no critical damages. But the opening of the bridge is slightly delayed.” A Ukrainian court has sentenced a Russian soldier to 10 years in jail after finding him guilty of violating the laws and customs of war by firing a tank at a multi-story apartment block, an interior ministry official said. Ukraine has received its first three Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft systems from Germany and will use them to defend important infrastructure facilities, the southern military command has said. The Russian-installed head of southern Ukraine’s occupied Zaporizhzhia region signed on Monday a decree providing for a referendum on joining Russia. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the Ukraine live blog for today. I’ll be back tomorrow morning. Thanks for following along. The Pentagon has unveiled the latest billion dollar slice of US military aid to Ukraine. The main items are more ammunition for the 16 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) the US has sent, as well as new missiles for the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS), a thousand Javelin anti-tank missiles, and hundreds of Swedish made AT4 shoulder launched anti-tank systems. Colin Kahl, the Pentagon policy chief, noted it was the 18th drawdown on US military stocks sent to Ukraine, making a total of $9.8bn in security assistance so far under the Biden administration. “This is the largest single drawdown of US arms and equipment utilizing this authority to date,” Kahl said. “The package provides a significant amount of additional ammunition, weapons and equipment, the types of which the Ukrainian people are using so effectively to defend their country.” Kahl said the rockets (Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems or GMLRS) the US has been sending to Ukraine to fire from the Himars mobile launch vehicles, are “having a very profound effect”. “This is a 200 pound warhead. It’s kind of the equivalent of an airstrike, frankly, a precision guided airstrike,” he said. “These are GPS-guided munitions. They’ve been very effective in hitting things that previously the Ukrainians had difficulty hitting reliably - so command-and-control nodes, sustainment and logistics hubs, key radar systems and other things. And what it’s done is it’s made it more difficult for the Russians to move forces around the battlefield. “They’ve had to move certain assets back away from the Himars. It slowed them down. It’s made it harder for them to resupply other forces. So I think it’s having real operational effects.” He estimated Russian casualties as 70,000 to 80,000 dead and wounded. The US will provide an additional $4.5bn (£3.7bn) to Ukraine’s government, bringing its total budgetary support since Russia’s February invasion to $8.5bn (£7bn), the US Agency for International Development has announced. The funding, coordinated with the US Treasury Department through the World Bank, will go to the Ukraine government in tranches, beginning with a $3bn (£2.5 bn) disbursement in August, USAid, the Agency for International Development, said. Reuters reported: It follows previous transfers of $1.7bn in July and $1.3bn in June, USAid said. Washington has also provided billions of dollars in military support, and plans a new $1bn weapons package shortly. The U.S. funds are to help the Ukrainian government maintain essential functions, including social and financial assistance for the growing poor population, children with disabilities, and millions of internally displaced persons, as the war drags on. Ukrainian officials estimate the country faces a $5bn-a-month fiscal shortfall - or 2.5% of pre-war gross domestic product - due to the cost of the war and declining tax revenues. Economists say that will swell Ukraine’s annual deficit to 25% of GDP, compared with 3.5% before the conflict. The World Bank estimates that 55% of Ukrainians will be living in poverty by the end of 2023 as a result of the war and the large numbers of displaced persons, compared with 2.5% before the start of the war. Ukraine has arrested two people working for Russian intelligence services who planned to kill the Ukrainian defence minister and the head of the country’s military intelligence agency, Ukraine’s domestic security service said on Monday. The Security Service of Ukraine foiled the plot by the Russian GRU military intelligence agency to use a sabotage group to carry out three murders including that of a prominent Ukrainian activist, the agency said. The assertions could not be independently verified by Reuters and there was no immediate reaction to the Ukraine statement from Moscow or Russian state-run media. The suspects, one a resident of the eastern Luhansk region held by Russia-backed separatists and the other a resident of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, were promised up to $150,000 (£124,000) by Russian handlers for the murder of each of their targets, the SBU said. The man from Luhansk region entered Ukraine from Belarus and was detained in the city of Kovel in north-west Ukraine along with the Kyiv resident, the statement said. The Russian-installed head of the occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region signed a decree on Monday providing for a referendum on joining Russia, in the latest sign that Moscow is moving ahead with its plans to annex seized Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has ruled out any peace talks with Russia if the country proceeds with referendums in the occupied areas. Yevgeny Balitskyi, the head of the pro-Russia administration in the region, announced the decision to kickstart the process during a pro-Moscow forum entitled “We are with Russia” organised in Melitopol, the largest city controlled by Russia in Zaporizhzhia. “I am signing the order for the central election committee to start the preparations for holding a referendum on the reunification of the Zaporizhzhia region with the Russian Federation,” he said. Roughly two-thirds of Zaporizhzhia is under Russian occupation, part of a swathe of southern Ukraine that Moscow captured early in the war, including most of the neighbouring Kherson region, where Russian officials have also discussed plans for a referendum. Workers at the nuclear complex are “working under the barrels of Russian guns”, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN nuclear watchdog said on Monday, calling for an international mission to the plant this month. Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk said Russian forces want to cause electricity blackouts in southern Ukraine by shelling the Zaporizhzhia complex, adding that damage to the facility from Russian attacks means any radiation could not be detected. Tsymbaliuk spoke in Vienna as international alarm over artillery attacks on the Zaporizhzhia plant grew, with Kyiv warning of the risk of a Chernobyl-style catastrophe and appealing for the area to be made a demilitarised zone, Reuters reported. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has accused Ukraine of taking “Europe hostage” over the situation at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The plant is occupied by Russian forces, and each side has claimed the other has caused damage to the complex by shelling it. The International Atomic Energy Agency has been seeking to inspect it. Zakharova said: “The leaders of the United Nations and the IAEA, over and over again, do not dare to directly name the source of the threat. They are demonstrating their unwillingness to point the finger at Kyiv.” Reuters reported that she went on to say: “They are taking the whole of Europe hostage and are not against setting fire to it for the sake of their Nazi idols.” Ukraine’s atomic energy agency Energoatom is quoting Dmytro Lubinets, the country’s human rights ombudsman, on its official Telegram channel. It says: The Russian Federation continues acts of nuclear terrorism in relation to Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (NPP) facilities and its personnel. According to the information of the Main Directorate of Intelligence, the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP is currently mined, and individual employees of the station are subject to torture and enforced disappearance, and they receive threats. This poses a threat to the lives of employees and prevents the normal operation of the facility. As the commissioner for human rights of the parliament of Ukraine, I first of all declare the flagrant threat posed by the presence of the Russian military in Zaporizhzhia NPP not only for tens of millions of Ukrainians, but also for the whole world. The destructive consequences of nuclear terrorism and the spread of radioactivity do not ‘respect’ state borders, and radioactive emissions spread uncontrollably, the consequences of radioactive pollution remain for decades. Once again, I call on the secretary general of the UN, the IAEA and the entire world community to take all possible measures to send a security mission to the Zaporizhzhia NPP, to completely demilitarise the territory of the NPP, and to provide security guarantees to the employees of the nuclear plant and residents of the city. Reuters is carrying an opposing line from the Russian side. It quotes Russia’s foreign ministry as saying western nations are unwilling to point the finger of blame for the alleged shelling of the plant at Ukrainian forces, and that while Russia sees the IAEA’s request to inspect Zaporizhzhia, Kyiv has an interest in not allowing the inspection to take place. Ukraine has previously objected to the idea that the IAEA would visit Zaporizhzhia, as they fear it would lend legitimacy and normalise Russia’s occupation of the facility and the territory that surrounds it. For their part, if Ukraine’s claims that staff are being mistreated there are true, then Russia also has a vested interest in avoiding an inspection that might reveal this. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said if Russia were allowed to bully Ukraine, to invade and take territory without being opposed, then it would be “open season” around the world. The US’s top diplomat was speaking at a news conference alongside South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, as part of a visit that will also take him to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. “If we allow a big country to bully a smaller one, to simply invade it and take its territory, then it’s going to be open season, not just in Europe but around the world,” Blinken said. Reuters reported that Blinken said the US felt it was important to stand up to Russia because its aggression against Ukraine threatened the foundational principles of the international system. Pandor said no one in South Africa supported the war in Ukraine but that the prescripts of international law were not being applied evenly. “We should be equally concerned at what is happening to the people of Palestine, as we are with what is happening to the people of Ukraine,” she said. South Africa abstained from a United Nations vote denouncing the invasion of Ukraine, and like other African countries has resisted calls to condemn Russia. Ivan Fedorov, Ukraine’s elected mayor of Melitopol, has had harsh words on Telegram this afternoon following news that pro-Russian forces in Zaporizhzhia are moving towards holding a referendum to join the Russian Federation. Fedorov, who was forced into exile early in the war, writes: The collaborators decided to make another propaganda picture for the Russian mass media. They brought a crowd from other temporarily occupied territories of the Zaporizhzhia region to Melitopol – 700 people, because even that many cannot be recruited among the local population – and held a ‘forum’ in the city’s palace of culture. Yevhen Balytskyi, the Gauleiter of the Zaporizhzhia region, who at one time failed miserably in the local elections, gaining less than 10%, conducted the coven. It is difficult to guess what plans will appear in the head of this mentally ill local tsar and Kremlin henchman of tomorrow. In any case, his ‘orders’ have no legal significance. The RIA Novosti news agency reported earlier that Balytskyi signed the order for a referendum at a forum entitled “We are together with Russia”. It quotes Vladimir Rogov, a member of the main council of the regional administration imposed by pro-Russian secessionists saying on the radio: We are preparing 100 percent. Everything is working out. We will have a voting format that is quite understandable to people. We will not conduct any experiments. A Ukrainian court has sentenced a Russian soldier to 10 years in jail on Monday after finding him guilty of violating the laws and customs of war by firing a tank at a multistorey apartment block, an interior ministry official said. Reuters reports the court in Chernihiv, north-east Ukraine, found Mikhail Kulikov, guilty of hitting the residential building on 26 February, two days after Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine began. Kulikov, who was capture while fighting, pleaded guilty and sought a more lenient punishment because he said he had been following orders, the Ukrainian general prosecutor’s office said. The residential block was not a military target or being used for military purposes, it said. Russia has repeatedly denied that its forces deliberately target civilians. This is Martin Belam picking up the live blog again for an hour. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Russia is ready to facilitate a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the RIA Novosti news agency quoted Moscow’s permanent representative to the nuclear watchdog as saying on Monday. Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the plant, Europe’s largest nuclear facility, in recent days, Reuters reported. Natalia Kompaniets spends her days running over a dilemma with her daughter as they sit in their temporary new home, a simply furnished room on the first floor of an unmarked building, in a nondescript suburb of Budapest. “Every day we think, should we go back or not? There’s a battle in our souls,” said Kompaniets, a 51-year-old who left the town of Obukhiv outside Kyiv in early March along with her daughter and young granddaughter. Here, as well as elsewhere in Hungary, Poland and other countries neighbouring Ukraine, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees – mostly women, children and elderly people – are weighing up similar questions. If they are from a relatively safe part of Ukraine, is it time to return? Should they wait for the war to end? And how long would that mean waiting? Russian forces want to cause electricity blackouts in southern Ukraine by shelling its Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex, the Ukrainian ambassador to the global nuclear watchdog has said, calling for an international mission to the plant this month. “We will use all possible channels of diplomacy to bring the IAEA and UN closer to conducting this mission,” Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk, the ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters in Vienna. “We really need it urgently, as soon as possible, I would say not later than the end of this month,” he added. Ukraine has received its first three German Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft systems and will use them to defend important infrastructure facilities, the southern military command has said. The air defence systems, which are operated by three-person crews and can hit targets at up to two and half miles, are one of various pieces of western military kit being supplied to Ukraine to help it fend off the Russian invasion, Reuters reported. The Russian-installed head of southern Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region has signed a decree providing for a referendum on joining Russia, the RIA Novosti news agency reported on Monday. It comes as Russia’s defence ministry said that Ukraine had shelled the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, the biggest in Europe, on 7 August, damaging high-voltage power lines and forcing the plant to reduce its output. In its daily military briefing, the defence ministry said Ukraine had shelled the power station at around 12.40pm (9.40am GMT) from positions near the town of Marhanets, Reuters reported. The shelling damaged a high-voltage power line supplying electricity to the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions – parts of which are under Russian control – in southern Ukraine, the ministry said. A power surge also occurred as a result of the shelling, Moscow said, triggering a safety system that cut off the power supply, it added. German chancellor Olaf Scholz does not consider support for Russia sanctions to be waning even with energy bills expected to surge further, a government spokesperson said on Monday. “We face difficult months ahead,” the spokesperson said, adding: “But it is clear that we stand firmly on the side of Ukraine and we stand behind the sanctions that we agreed together with the European Union and the international community”. Speaking at a regular news conference in Berlin, the spokesperson also ruled out approval for the shelved Nord Stream 2 pipeline, Reuters reported. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed its forces shot down 19 US-made Himars missiles across eastern and southern Ukraine, and destroyed Himars vehicles near the Ukrainian town of Kramatorsk. Reuters was unable to verify the reports. More on this claim as it comes. The Kremlin said on Monday there was no basis for a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents at the moment. In response to a question about Turkish president Tayyip Erdoğan’s offers to broker peace talks, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call that Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy could meet only after negotiators from both sides had “done their homework”. Negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv have been stalled for months, with each side blaming the other for a lack of progress, Reuters reported. “The Ukrainian delegation has gone off the radar, there is no negotiation process now,” Peskov said on Monday. “As for a meeting between presidents Putin and Zelenskiy, it is possible only after all the homework has been done by the delegations. This is missing, so there are no necessary prerequisites for the meeting,” he added. Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for renewed shelling of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, the Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new international sanctions on Moscow for “nuclear terror”. The UN nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to all military action near the plant after it was hit by shelling on Saturday night, causing one of the reactors to shut down and creating a “very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station is operating normally according to reports from Yevgeniy Balitsky, head of the Russian-installed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom called for the plant to be made a military-free zone, and said there should be a team of peacekeepers present at the site. Ukraine conducted long-range strikes on Russian troop bases and two key bridges across the Dnieper River overnight. The strikes hit the only two crossings Russia has to the pocket of southern Ukrainian territory it has occupied on the western bank of the river, said Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command. “The results are rather respectable, hits on the Antonivskyi and Kakhovskyi bridges,” she said on television. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the pro-Russian administration imposed on occupied Kherson told Interfax: “The equipment of the builders who are repairing the Antonivskiy bridge burned down, there are no critical damages. But the opening of the bridge is slightly delayed.” Four ships carrying Ukrainian foodstuffs sailed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Sunday. Pope Francis welcomed the departure of the ships carrying grain from Ukrainian Black Sea ports saying this could be a model for dialogue to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. Two more grain-carrying ships have sailed from Ukraine’s Black sea ports on Monday, and the Polarnet, carrying 12,000 tons of Ukrainian corn, has arrived in Turkey. Russia is strengthening its positions and numbers on Ukraine’s southern front to ready itself for a Ukrainian counteroffensive and is likely to be preparing the ground to attack, according to British and Ukrainian military authorities. “Russian troops are almost certainly amassing in the south, either waiting for a Ukrainian counteroffensive or preparing to attack. Long convoys of Russian military trucks, tanks, artillery and other things continue to move from the Donbas to the south-west,” the UK’s defence ministry said. Russian shelling was recorded on Saturday in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern frontlines, according to the Ukrainian military. It also said Russian forces attempted to conduct assault in six different areas in the eastern Donetsk region, all of which failed to gain any territory and were held back by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine is investigating almost 26,000 suspected war crime cases committed since Russia’s invasion in February and has charged 135 people, its chief war crimes prosecutor told Reuters. Of those charged, approximately 15 are in Ukrainian custody and the remaining 120 remain at large. Zelenskiy said on Sunday that there could be no talks with Russia if it proceeds with referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine on joining Russia. Russian forces now hold large areas of territory in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region and in southern areas, where officials have raised the possibility of holding referendums. Finland has registered a record number of asylum seekers following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, beating a previous high set during the 2015 migrant crisis. Human rights group Amnesty International apologised for the “distress and anger” caused by a report that accused Ukraine of endangering civilians. The apology comes after Amnesty’s Ukraine head Oksana Pokalchuk said that she was resigning as she opposed the report’s publication, saying the human rights group unwittingly “created material that sounded like support for Russian narratives of the invasion”. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom called this morning for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to be made a military-free zone, and said there should be a team of peacekeepers present at the site. Reuters reports he made the comments on television after Ukraine and Russia accused each of shelling the nuclear power plant – Europe’s biggest – which lies in Russian-occupied southern Ukraine. At the same time, Energoatom has posted on its official Telegram channel accusing Russia of mining the plant. It claims to be quoting “the head of the radiation, chemical and biological defence forces of the Russian Federation, major general Valeriy Vasyliev”, accusing him of saying: “We have planted mines in all the important facilities of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. And we do not hide this from the enemy. We warned them. The enemy knows that the plant will be either Russian – or no one’s.” AFP reports Finland has registered a record number of asylum seekers following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, beating a previous high set during the 2015 migrant crisis. “By 4 August, those fleeing Ukraine due to the Russian military attack had submitted 35,074 applications for temporary protection,” the Finnish immigration service said in a statement. More than 37,000 people are currently registered in the reception system, “which is more than ever before”. “One third of those fleeing Ukraine are children,” the immigration service said. The latest figures from UNHCR, the UN’s refugee agency, show that over 6.3 million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded across Europe. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station is operating normally according to reports from Yevgeniy Balitsky, the head of the Russian-installed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. Reuters reports he told Interfax: “We have information from the military and representatives of Russia’s Rosatom, who are here, just watching the situation. We have information from them that everything is operating in normal mode.” Ukraine conducted long-range strikes on Russian troop bases and two key bridges across the Dnieper River overnight, Ukrainian officials have said. The strikes hit the only two crossings Russia has to the pocket of southern Ukrainian territory it has occupied on the western bank of the river, said Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command. “The results are rather respectable, hits on the Antonivskyi and Kakhovskyi bridges,” Reuters reports she said on television. The claims have not been independently verified, but earlier Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the pro-Russian administration imposed on occupied Kherson, told the Interfax news agency that the Antonivskyi bridge had been struck again. Here is a selection of images that have been sent to us today over the newswires from Sloviansk, in Ukraine’s Donetsk region. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, appears to have confirmed on Telegram that at least one person has been killed in a strike this morning, posting “Unfortunately, as a result of the morning shelling, one person died, another one was injured. Information is being updated. Emergency medical personnel are on site.” In the last few minutes the mayor of Kharkiv, Ihor Terekhov has posted to Telegram to say: Now Pavlovo Pole is being shelled already in the morning … minutes ago there was an explosion. There is definitely no military infrastructure in this peaceful and densely populated area. I ask everyone to be in shelters – the shelling can be repeated. Here is an image that has been sent to us from Turkey of the ship Polarnet arriving at Derince port. It is carrying 12,000 tons of Ukrainian corn. Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of Kharkiv, has said that two people were killed in shelling on the region in the last 24 hours. He claimed that overnight the roof of the administrative building in Kharkiv’s Kyiv district had caught fire due to the shelling. His message ended: As you can see, the Russians, because of their lack of success at the front, are striking peaceful towns and villages in the region. But we are stronger than their pathetic attempts to intimidate us. Victory is ours! In the last few minutes he has issued a broad warning to citizens in Kharkiv, posting to Telegram to say: “Residents of Kharkiv and the region, stay in shelters as much as possible. The Russian occupiers strike Kharkiv. Do not leave safe places.” In his daily status update, Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has cautioned residents about the information sources they use, saying overnight rumours had been spread about a failure of the air alert system. He wrote on Telegram: On 8 August, at 2.57am, one of the Telegram channels spread information that there was an air alert in Lviv, but due to technical reasons, the city and phone applications did not turn on the notification. This information is not true! There was no threat. Follow and trust only official sources of information. The claim has not been independently verified. Elsewhere in his daily update, Kozytskyi said there had been one genuine air alert overnight, but that “the danger did not materialise”, and that 270 people arrived in his region on two evacuation trains from the east of the country. Seven hundred and 68 people departed from the Lviv oblast to Przemyśl in Poland on four trains. My colleague Shaun Walker recently wrote a lengthy profile of Dmitry Medvedev on the former Russian leader’s journey from liberal to anti-western hawk. Medvedev has given an interview to Tass, which it has published this morning, which contains plenty of Medvedev’s anti-western rhetoric. The interview is timed to coincide with the anniversary of Russia’s assault on Georgia in 2008. which took place when he was in power. In today’s interview, Medvedev says: The criminal policy of the United States is being aggressively pursued in Ukraine. True, with much more active support from the European Union, which has finally lost its independence. The goal is the same – to destroy Russia. This is the root cause of the extremely aggressive, Russophobic geopolitical process initiated by the west. Our answer is tough, but carefully thought out. If there is an opportunity to resolve the problem peacefully, at the negotiating table, this should be done. But when there is no way out, you have to react by force. Unfortunately, both in Georgia and Ukraine, the authorities of these countries left Russia no choice, disrupting the processes of political settlement of these conflicts. And we deliberately went for military intervention. As far as Nato is concerned, its relentless desire to expand along Russia’s borders, like a cancerous tumour, has become a global problem. It makes all reasonable people sick. You can read the full Medvedev interview with Tass here. Read Shaun Walker’s profile of Medvedev here: ‘I hate them’: Dmitry Medvedev’s journey from liberal to anti-western hawk The self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic, an entity recognised as legitimate and official by only three UN member states, has issued a briefing for the day in which they say in the last 24 hours they have killed “up to 53 personnel” from Ukrainian forces, and destroyed four armoured personnel carriers and “seven units of special vehicles”. The announcement on Telegram also claims that as a result of shelling by Ukrainian forces on the city of Alchevsk in occupied Luhansk, one civilian was killed and 19 people were injured, including five children. They claim that 13 apartment buildings, four kindergartens and a school were damaged. They claim that “peaceful life is being restored in the territories of the Luhansk People’s Republic liberated from Ukrainian nationalists” and cite more than five hectares being cleared of explosive devices. They also claim to be delivering humanitarian aid. None of the claims have been independently verified. A key Russian-held bridge into the occupied southern city of Kherson has been hit again overnight by Ukrainian forces, according to reports from the Russian-imposed administration there. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the pro-Russian administration imposed on occupied Kherson, told the Interfax news agency: The blow was struck on the Antonivskiy bridge. The equipment of the builders who are repairing the bridge burned down, there are no critical damages. But the opening of the bridge is slightly delayed. Ukrainian forces have repeatedly targeted the bridge with high-precision weapons as it is one of only two permanent re-supply routes over the Dnieper River, linking the occupied city with the rest of Kherson region and down to annexed Crimea in the south. The claims have not been independently verified. Ivan Fedorov, Ukraine’s elected mayor of Melitopol, has posted to Telegram overnight about the situation in the occupied city, which he is in exile from. He told his supporters on Telegram: Today, high-precision Himars missiles fired at the points of temporary deployment of the occupying forces at industrial sites in various districts of the city of Melitopol. Last week, the occupiers redeployed a significant part of air defence from Melitopol to Kherson. Tonight is the most effective and shows that the existing enemy air defence units are no longer able to resist Himars. The weakening of the air defence system creates the necessary prerequisites for a successful counteroffensive in the direction of Melitopol. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog for the next few hours. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Two more grain carrying ships have sailed from Ukraine’s Black sea ports, Reuters reports. The Sacura, which departed from Yuzni, is carrying 11,000 tonnes of soybeans to Italy, while the Arizona, which left Chernomorsk, is carrying 48,458 tonnes of corn to Iskenderun in southern Turkey. It is highly likely Russia is deploying anti-personnel mines to protect and deter freedom of movement along its defensive lines in Donetsk and Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. The PFM-1 and PFM-1S mines, also known as “butterfly mines”, have the potential to inflict widespread casualties amongst both the military and the local civilian population. The ministry calls the PFM-1 mines “deeply controversial and indiscriminate weapons”, pointing to the devastating impact the mines had in the Soviet-Afghan war where they allegedly maimed a number of children who mistook them for toys. Battle for Donbas Russian forces are trying to gain full control of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region as it stepped up attacks north and north-west of Donetsk city on Sunday, Reuters reports The Russians attacked Ukrainian positions near the heavily fortified settlements of Piski and Avdiivka, as well as shelling other locations in the Donetsk region, according to Ukraine’s military. In addition to tightening its grip over the Donbas, Russia is entrenching its position in southern Ukraine, where it has gathered troops in a bid to prevent a potential counter-offensive near Kherson. Hello, it’s Jordyn Beazley back with you on the Guardian’s live blog as we cover all the latest developments from Ukraine. UN secretary general António Guterres has called for international inspectors to be given access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant after Ukraine and Russia traded accusations over the shelling of Europe’s largest atomic plant at the weekend. “Any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,” Guterres told a news conference in Japan on Monday, two days after attending the Hiroshima peace memorial ceremony to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the world’s first atomic bombing. Here’s a summary of the main points you might have missed: Russia is strengthening its positions and numbers on Ukraine’s southern front to ready itself for a Ukrainian counteroffensive and is likely to be preparing the ground to attack, according to British and Ukrainian military authorities. Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for renewed shelling of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, the Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new international sanctions on Moscow for “nuclear terror”. Russian shelling was recorded on Saturday in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern frontlines, according to the Ukrainian military.

But how dangerous is the situation and what is likely to happen next? Why is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant important? The plant, built in the Soviet era, is the largest nuclear reactor in Europe. Its six pressurised water reactors (of which at least two are currently operating) are important to Kyiv as they can produce power for up to 4m homes. Situated on the south bank of the Dnieper river at Enerhodar, south-west of the city of Zaporizhzhia itself, the plant occupies an extremely important strategic position both for Russian and Ukrainian forces, who have been contesting control of the site since early in the war. The presence of the water-cooled reactors, as well as a spent fuel storage facility, on the large and sprawling site has led Russia to use it as a so called “sheltered” artillery park, using the facilities to fire on Ukrainian positions in the belief that Ukraine would not fire back and risk a nuclear accident. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has accused the Russians of using the plant as a “nuclear shield” saying: “Of course the Ukrainians cannot fire back lest there be a terrible accident involving the nuclear plant.” That has allowed Russia to target areas like the city of Nikopol across the river which has come under heavy shelling in recent weeks. Why is there renewed concern? There are two issues fuelling a deepening anxiety over the situation at the plant, which is under Russian control but uses Ukrainian staff. International nuclear safety officials have become concerned over the lack of spare parts, access for routine maintenance of the reactors and lack of contact with staff all of which have been disrupted by the ongoing conflict. A second issue is grad missile fire around the plant at the weekend, with Russians and Ukrainians pointing the finger over responsibility. According to Energoatom – the Ukrainian nuclear authority – the impacts were close to the spent fuel storage area with the operator claiming Russian troops “aimed specifically” at the containers despite the presence of Russian troops at the site. However, it is worth noting that Ukrainian officials at times have somewhat overstated claims about nuclear risks posed by the conflict both at Chornobyl and Zaporizhzhia – so for now it is not clear how dangerous this weekend’s incident was in and of itself. While Ukraine’s objective – to see the plant treated as a demilitarised area – is an entirely prudent call it would also serve a military objective by denying Russian forces the use of a plant from which they can shell with relative impunity. A final dimension is a claim by Ukrainian intelligence – reported in Ukrainian media outlets – that Russia has mined facilities, quoting the head of the radiation, chemical and biological defence troops of the Russian armed forces, Maj Gen Valery Vasiliev, who now commands the Zaporizhzhia garrison, saying: “There will be either Russian land or a scorched desert.” However, a major and deliberate detonation in Zaporizhzhia would threaten southern Russia as well as Ukraine with nuclear contamination, so it is important to distinguish between “nuclear blackmail” and a serious threat that would have repercussions for Russia itself. So how dangerous is shelling around the plant? The reactors are designed to withstand substantial impact – think of a civilian airliner crashing into them – protected with steel and reinforced concrete as well as fire protection systems, although a strike from a substantial missile might be more problematic. The buildings housing the spent fuel, however, are not built with a similar level of protection, meaning that a release of spent fuel material is probably a greater risk from fighting than a catastrophic breach of a reactor, although more limited. The reality is that the situation at the plant in terms of safety operations is probably the most serious issue, as a deteriorating safety regime caused by the conflict has been exacerbated by a risk of a strike. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, described the ongoing crisis of safety oversight as a dire threat to public health and the environment in Ukraine, and far beyond its borders, describing the situation as “completely out of control.” “You have a catalogue of things that should never be happening in any nuclear facility,” he said. While Grossi has suggested a mission to the plant, ironically Ukraine has been blocking the initiative, with Energoatom arguing as recently as June that any visit would legitimise Russia’s presence there."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/27/biden-trump-missile-nuclear-posture-review","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-27T16:41:16Z","webTitle":"Biden to scrap Trump missile project but critics attack US ‘nuclear overkill’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/27/biden-trump-missile-nuclear-posture-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/27/biden-trump-missile-nuclear-posture-review","fields":{"bodyText":"The Biden administration has confirmed it will cancel a submarine-launched nuclear cruise missile programme begun by Donald Trump, as part of its review of nuclear policy. The administration will also retire a gravity bomb, the B83-1, from its arsenal as part of its Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), but arms control advocates argued the changes from the Trump era did not go far enough. The administration is retaining another weapon variant introduced by Trump, a low-yield warhead called the W76-2, intended to deter an adversary like Russia using a low-yield weapon. The Democratic party manifesto in 2020 had called the W76-2 “unnecessary, wasteful, and indefensible”. The Biden NPR said that the “fundamental role of nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear attack on the United States, our allies, and partners”. That declaratory policy stops sort of saying deterring nuclear attack is the sole purpose of the arsenal, which is what Biden promised in his election campaign. Instead, the NPR says that the US could strike back against “a narrow range of other high consequence, strategic-level attacks”. Jon Wolfsthal, who was special assistant to Barack Obama on arms control and nonproliferation issues, expressed disappointment in the Biden NPR. “The world is a dangerous place and our allies and we still rely on nuclear deterrence but this document ignores the role the US can play to make nukes less usable, less likely,” Wolfsthal said on Twitter. The policy document points to arms control agreements as offering “the most effective, durable and responsible path to achieving a key goal: reducing the role of nuclear weapons in US strategy.” It undertakes to uphold the last remaining arms control agreement with Russia, the New Start treaty, and negotiate a successor agreement when it expires in 2026, but it adds: “negotiation requires a willing partner operating in good faith”. The NPR points out that as well as strategic weapons subject to the limits of New Start, Russia has an active stockpile of up to 2,000 non-strategic, or tactical, warheads, of the sort Vladimir Putin and his officials have hinted could be used against Ukraine. The US only has a few hundred tactical weapons. “Similarly, Russia is pursuing several novel nuclear-capable systems designed to hold the US homeland or allies and partners at risk, some of which are also not accountable under New Start,” the NPR said. The document repeats an earlier US estimate that China will have 1,000 deliverable warheads by the end of the decade, so that by the 2030s the US “will, for the first time in its history, face two major nuclear powers as strategic competitors and potential adversaries.” Introducing the National Defence Strategy, in which the NPR is a part, the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, described China as America’s “pacing challenge” while Russia was an “immediate and sharp threat” which “could not systemically challenge the US over the long term”. The NPR leaves open the possibility that the US might have to increase its arsenal as a result of the dual threat from China and Russia, saying that “as the security environment evolves, it may be necessary to consider nuclear strategy and force adjustments to assure our ability to achieve deterrence.” In response to the NPR, Jessica Sleight, partner for policy at Global Zero, a disarmament advocacy group, said: “Contrary to President Biden’s stated intentions to reduce the role of nuclear weapons, this Nuclear Posture Review continues decades of nuclear overkill, doubles down on needless weapons programs, and fails to advance overdue reforms to policy and posture that would make the United States, its allies, and the world safer.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/20/unite-union-rampant-profiteering-ofgem-cap-power-distributors-profits-sharon-graham","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-20T17:18:46Z","webTitle":"‘Rampant profiteering’: Unite asks Ofgem to cap power distributors’ profits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/20/unite-union-rampant-profiteering-ofgem-cap-power-distributors-profits-sharon-graham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/20/unite-union-rampant-profiteering-ofgem-cap-power-distributors-profits-sharon-graham","fields":{"bodyText":"The companies responsible for bringing electricity to UK homes have been accused of “rampant profiteering” by a leading union that is calling for the energy regulator to cap their earnings. Sharon Graham, general secretary of Unite, has written to Ofgem to ask it to clamp down on “excessive” profits generated by regional electricity distribution network operators (DNOs), which raked in £15.8bn in profits last year and have paid out £3.6bn in dividends between 2017 and 2021. In the letter to Ofgem, which has been seen by the Guardian, Graham said the six operators have “been holding the public to ransom for too much and for too long” and called for a recent consultation on the amount they could charge energy suppliers, and ultimately consumers, to be reopened. Graham wants Ofgem, which has been condemned for its handling of the energy crisis, to revise its policies to tighten the controls on DNOs. “It is time to set a clear cap on profits to help give consumers confidence that their energy bills are fair and not simply a vehicle for profiteering energy network owners,” she said. Research by Common Wealth, a thinktank, shows that DNOs have higher profit margins than any other sector in the UK, and expects operators to register profit margins of more than 50% in 2022. The thinktank argues that consumers are paying for privatised monopolies to reward their investors. The government has curbed profits on North Sea oil and gas producers and introduced a levy on “excess returns” made by electricity generators including windfarms and nuclear power plants. However, the profits of DNOs – which carry the energy but do not sell it – have not been on the political agenda. Their earnings have not been inflated by high wholesale gas prices, but charges to consumers through network costs have been rising. Ofgem sets price controls on the monopolies’ revenues for five-year periods to ensure that companies run efficient networks and are incentivised to invest in improving them. In 2019, the regulator conceded that the cost to consumers of transmission were “higher than they needed to be” and that profit margins were “towards the higher end of our expectations”. Average households paid £214.35 for gas and electricity distribution in 2021, it said. The current network price controls period ends this April, with the next five-year period beginning after that. Ofgem is due to make its final determinations on the pricing on 30 November after a consultation with the industry, which began before the energy crisis. In her letter to Ofgem’s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, Graham asked for the regulator to reopen the consultation. As part of her call for an earnings cap, she cited the profits of UK Power Networks (UKPN), which distributes power to 8.3m homes and businesses across London, the east and south-east of England. Common Wealth analysis shows the company has made £2.4bn in profits over the past four years. The UK’s largest electricity distributor, which is owned by CK Hutchison, the Hong Kong-based holding company that also owns the port of Felixstowe, has paid out £1bn in dividends to shareholders over the same period. CK bought UKPN for £5.5bn in 2010 and a £15bn sale of the DNO to a consortium collapsed in the summer amid concerns over the price. In the past four years, Northern Powergrid, which has 3.9 million customers in north-east England and Yorkshire, made £1bn in profit, and Electricity North West made £323m, handing out £212m to shareholders. Northern Powergrid did not pay a dividend during the period, but did in 2015 (£100m) and in 2017 (£50m). In her letter, Graham said: “Ofgem is a regulator that doesn’t regulate. Time for that to change. How long must the public pay for profiteering from the likes of UK Power Networks? It’s time to pull the plug on the energy profiteers.” A spokesperson for UKPN said its cost to the customer was £98 on average, “one of the lowest of any UK electricity distributor and falling as a percentage of the overall electricity bill by a proposed 15% in real terms over the period 2023-28”. The company has invested £6.4bn over 11 years in networks, it said. Ofgem said: “We do not believe that it would be in consumers’ interests to delay the implementation of the price control.” A spokesperson for Energy Networks Association, which represents energy network operators, claimed that Unite’s figures were “misleading” and that investment returns were an accurate reflection of profitability. “The network companies are allowed, by Ofgem, to earn around 5% on their investments and the figures being suggested do not reflect the costs associated with these essential investments,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/15/chinese-congress-expected-to-cement-power-of-xi-jinping","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-15T14:11:39Z","webTitle":"Chinese congress expected to cement power of Xi Jinping","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/15/chinese-congress-expected-to-cement-power-of-xi-jinping","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/15/chinese-congress-expected-to-cement-power-of-xi-jinping","fields":{"bodyText":"The highest level meeting of China’s ruling Communist party this week is likely to include constitutional changes to further cement the power of the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, party officials have confirmed. Xi is expected to regain his position as leader of the CCP and its military commission at the week-long conference, setting the stage for retaining the presidency next year, after abolishing term limits in 2018. The 20th party congress will begin on Sunday morning with a major speech by Xi, espousing the party’s achievements over the past five-year term, and outlining its plans for the next. Days of closed-door meetings and the formalisation of official reshuffles will follow, before the members of the all-powerful politburo standing committee are revealed next weekend. At a press conference in Beijing, the party spokesperson Sun Yeli told reporters revisions of the party’s governing constitution were on the agenda. Sun did not provide specifics but said amendments were necessary to enshrine new “major theoretical views and major strategic ideas” introduced during the congress. Amendments are widely expected to enshrine the “two establishes”, a party political term for new doctrines cementing Xi as the “core” of the CCP and his ideas as the party’s underpinning ideology. Sun said it had been common practice for the party to make amendments to its constitution to “recognise innovations in theory and revolutions in practice”. During a pre-vetted Q&amp;A session, Sun also indicated China’s increasingly contentious Covid policy of “dynamic zero” was to remain for now. He said as much as the world yearned for the pandemic to end, the reality was the virus still existed, and China’s government would continue to “put people and people’s lives front and centre” in its response. The dynamic zero covid policy – which has resulted in sudden lockdowns and movement restrictions being imposed on buildings, neighbourhoods, or entire cities – was “a science-based approach … with minimum costs for the society and in the shortest possible time”. He said this policy had “worked the best for our country”. In the press conference, one of the few public events of the congress, Sun sidestepped questions about China’s economic troubles and whether the era of “high-speed growth” had come to an end. He said it was “an important yardstick but not the only one”; China had entered a new era, away from high-speed growth and towards high-quality development. On US relations, Sun appeared to take a somewhat conciliatory tone. The two countries’ relationship has plummeted in recent years, with trade wars, diplomatic spats and the imposition of sanctions, as well as hostilities over China’s human rights abuses and crackdowns on Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong, and its growing aggression in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait. Sun said: “We take the view that China and the US have more common interests than differences. We don’t provoke, nor do we flinch from facing up to trouble.” However, he said “no one can hold back the historic force of China’s national rejuvenation”, a reference to Xi’s commitment to annexing Taiwan – a democracy which the CCP claims is a Chinese province and has sworn to “unify”. The CCP has repeatedly said it will use force to take Taiwan if necessary, most recently in a white paper released last month. Sun said force was a last resort to be taken “under compelling circumstances” and that peaceful unification was the CCP’s “first choice”. “We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with utmost sincerity and effort, and create vast space for peaceful reunification,” he said. “We don’t renounce the use of force … This is to guard against external interference and a small handful of Taiwan independence elements and their separatist moves. By no means does this target our fellow Chinese in Taiwan.” Senior Chinese officials have recently increased their rhetoric over Taiwan, warning of “re-education” of citizens post-invasion, and punishment for independence advocates. Consistent opinion polling in Taiwan shows a growing majority reject the prospect of Chinese rule."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/apr/28/conservatives-devolution-scotland-rishi-sunak-glasgow-conference","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-28T14:16:29Z","webTitle":"Conservatives will not devolve more powers to Scotland, Rishi Sunak says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/28/conservatives-devolution-scotland-rishi-sunak-glasgow-conference","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/apr/28/conservatives-devolution-scotland-rishi-sunak-glasgow-conference","fields":{"bodyText":"Rishi Sunak has ruled out any further devolution of powers for Scotland after telling Conservative activists that Holyrood should be “held to account” more for underusing its existing powers. The prime minister claimed Holyrood already had significant powers, including over income tax rates, telling delegates at the Scottish Conservatives’ annual conference in Glasgow there was therefore no case for adding to them. “Scotland already is the most powerful devolved assembly anywhere in the world,” he said during a question-and-answer session chaired by Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader. “The SNP and the Scottish government doesn’t even use the powers they already have, so we shouldn’t start talking about any more. What we need to do is hold them to account.” His remarks suggest there will be an intense contest between Labour and the Conservatives over Scotland’s powers at the next general election, which could further divide the anti-independence vote in Scotland. Keir Starmer, the UK Labour leader, has committed his party to sweeping changes in Britain’s political structures, including abolishing the House of Lords, and as-yet-unspecified new powers for Holyrood. He also supports Holyrood’s higher taxes for higher earners – a policy the Tories oppose. As well as reform-minded unionists, Labour hopes to attract pro-independence voters who may see enhanced devolution as a compromise solution now that the prospects of a second independence referendum have greatly subsided after Nicola Sturgeon’s resignation, the SNP’s ill-tempered succession battle and the crisis with the police investigation into SNP finances. In his conference speech later on Friday, Ross abandoned a previous proposal that Tory voters in SNP-Labour and SNP-Liberal Democrat marginals should consider voting tactically by backing the best-placed unionist party instead of automatically voting Tory. That proposal, which Ross made in an interview with the Daily Telegraph this month, was quickly shot down by No 10. Sunak’s remarks and his short speech earlier to delegates were overshadowed by a heated row involving No 10 officials and Scottish political journalists after Downing Street tried to restrict access to a briefing with Sunak to six handpicked newspapers. A large group of reporters, who were accredited to cover the conference and were also members of the Scottish Parliamentary Journalists’ Association, sidestepped party officials and entered the briefing room, followed by television crews. The dispute follows a previous clash between Westminster lobby correspondents and No 10 officials who tried to restrict access to briefings with Boris Johnson to handpicked media outlets. After a protracted and at times fractious standoff in Glasgow, during which No 10 insisted that reporters and TV crews who had not been invited had to leave, and then threatened to cancel the briefing, it took place an hour late with every newspaper reporter present. In his conference-floor appearance, Sunak also said the UK government had the right to sidestep the Scottish parliament by directly funding initiatives at local level in policy areas devolved to Holyrood, as part of its levelling up agenda. The Tories argue that Scotland has two governments – at Holyrood and at Westminster – and that was “really healthy”, Sunak said, adding that it was well-received by Scottish councils and local communities. “We know that in the same way that Westminster doesn’t always know best, it’s not the case that in Scotland the SNP and the Holyrood government always know best,” he said. “We don’t have to just hand everything over to the Scottish government. I think that’s real devolution, or devolution in action at a very local level.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/30/net-zero-strategy-shows-uk-will-miss-2030-emissions-cuts-target","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-30T16:55:46Z","webTitle":"Net zero strategy shows UK will miss 2030 emissions cuts target ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/30/net-zero-strategy-shows-uk-will-miss-2030-emissions-cuts-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/30/net-zero-strategy-shows-uk-will-miss-2030-emissions-cuts-target","fields":{"bodyText":"The UK government has said it is still on track to meet its international climate commitments under the Paris agreement, as analysis of its energy plans suggested more drastic policies would be needed to make the required carbon cuts. Ministers announced the UK’s revamped net zero strategy on Thursday, with a raft of documents exceeding 1,000 pages, setting out policies on sectors from biomass to solar power, and from electric vehicles to nuclear reactors. It came as Rishi Sunak headed to Oxfordshire to visit a development facility for nuclear fusion, accompanied by Grant Shapps, the energy and net zero secretary. The prime minister said: “People should be really proud of the UK’s track record on all of this. If you look at it, we’ve decarbonised faster than any other major economy. Our carbon emissions have been reduced by over 40%, much more than all the other countries that we compete with.” Shapps later told Sky News: “We all know that electricity can be a big way to decarbonise, but we also know these are big changes. So this is not a sort of rip-out-your-boiler moment. This is a transition over a period of time to get to homes which are heated in a different way and also insulated much better.” The government’s analysis, however, shows that its new policies will meet only 92% of the emissions cuts required and, without further changes, the target will be missed. At the heart of its strategy is the UK’s legally binding requirement to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and its commitment under the Paris agreement to a plan – called a nationally determined contribution, or NDC – to cut emissions by 68% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. The 2030 pledge, boasted of as “world-leading” in the run-up to the Cop26 summit in Glasgow in 2021, is vital to get the UK on track to meet the long-term goal, and will be closely scrutinised by other governments. Within the dense pages of analysis and recommendations, the official assessment of the NDC stood out: “We have quantified emissions savings to deliver 88 megatonnes or 92% of the NDC. We are confident that the delivery of emissions savings by unquantified policies detailed in this package will largely close this gap and the government will bring forward further measures to ensure [it] will meet its international commitments if required.” However, Chris Venables, the head of politics at Green Alliance thinktank, said: “Our analysis shows that even that 92% is a very generous reading. It is hard to celebrate an announcement that says itself it’s not enough. The bottom line is that this plan doesn’t plot a route to net zero. There are only so many times we can claim climate leadership while falling short of our own targets.” Ed Miliband, the shadow climate and net zero secretary, told MPs: “A target for less than seven years’ time, and they [the government] are miles off … all of the policies, all of the hot air, don’t meet the target they promised on the world stage.” A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero told the Guardian: “We remain committed to delivering our international commitments, including the 2030 NDC under the Paris agreement which we fully expect to meet. We are on track to deliver our carbon budgets, creating jobs and investment across the UK while reducing emissions. Our carbon budget delivery plan is a dynamic long-term plan for a transition that will take place over the next 15 years, setting us on course to reach net zero by 2050.” A few of the winners … Electric vehicles Car manufacturers must ensure a proportion of their sales are of electric vehicles – 22% of cars and 10% of vans by 2024 – under a zero emissions vehicle mandate, though campaigners said the proportion had been set too low. About £800m in capital funding is being made available for electric vehicles, and there will be a boost to EV charging infrastructure. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) Much of the government’s strategy for continuing with fossil fuel development – with decisions on potential new oil and gas fields imminent – rests on the deployment of technology to capture and store carbon dioxide in geological formations under the North Sea. The government shortlisted eight projects to move ahead in its funding scheme, including one backed by oil giant BP, and expects to make £20bn of investment available over 20 years in CCS. Hydrogen and nuclear The government named 20 new hydrogen projects that are on track to receive a share of £240m, to help the development of a fuel the government sees as central to the UK’s low-carbon future. It comes despite doubts among experts over some of its applications – particularly in home heating – and some of its sources, as fossil fuel companies are looking to hydrogen to allow them to continue drilling. Great British Nuclear will be a new organisation intended to come forward with small nuclear projects that the government believes will be key to its aim of generating a quarter of the UK’s electricity from nuclear by 2050. And some of the gaps and the losers … Onshore wind The government dashed hopes that its new strategy might lift the ban on onshore windfarms in England. The lack of action has frustrated leading academics and green groups because onshore windfarms could begin powering the grid far sooner than nuclear reactors, and would help to reduce energy bills. Dr Daniel Quiggin, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, said onshore wind could bring greater real emissions reductions than removing emissions from the air via carbon capture technology. Grid connections While the government hopes to boost renewable power generation, and nuclear energy, there was little detail on how to solve one of the most pressing problems for the UK’s ageing electricity network. New windfarms and other sources of power, and the battery storage facilities needed to smooth out the intermittency of renewable power, can wait years for the grid connections they need, partly owing to the difficulty of getting planning permission and partly to a lack of grid capacity. Andy Willis, the founder of Kona Energy, said: “Without significant grid connection reform, the vast potential of clean energy development will linger, trapped behind red tape and bureaucratic delays.” Farming There was little reference to agriculture, even though farming and food prices are highly sensitive to energy costs and agriculture is one of the biggest single sources of UK emissions. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was involved in the Whitehall discussions around Thursday’s announcements, but a key land use strategy is not due until the end of June. Then, both the future of farming emissions and the potential for growing trees and restoring landscapes to store carbon – and offset the UK’s remaining emissions by 2050 – will be addressed. Biomass There was drama on the stock market on Thursday as shares in Drax, which operates the UK’s biggest power station burning biomass, fell early on after the government appeared to reject its plea for increased subsidies for a project to capture and store the carbon dioxide from its wood burning. But Drax quickly pointed out that the main decisions on subsidies will follow later, by the end of June, when a biomass strategy is promised. The market confusion arose, the company claimed, because the government had separated its process for supporting hydrogen, gas and CCS projects from its consideration of biomass subsidies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/nov/17/power-failure-by-william-d-cohan-review-pulling-the-plug","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-17T11:00:47Z","webTitle":"Power Failure by William D Cohan review – pulling the plug","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/17/power-failure-by-william-d-cohan-review-pulling-the-plug","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/nov/17/power-failure-by-william-d-cohan-review-pulling-the-plug","fields":{"bodyText":"The executive suite of General Electric’s Connecticut headquarters was known as “carpet land”. Persian rugs and dense wool carpet covered every floor, creating an atmosphere of hushed probity. For almost a century, GE had stamped its curling blue logo on just about everything, from wind turbines to submarine detectors, fridges, televisions, toasters and lightbulbs. The office was a monument to the baronial power of its CEO. Jeff Immelt, the final chief to occupy this floor, enjoyed the use of a shoeshine station, a pantry and dining room. His two assistants also had their own private bathroom. When Immelt travelled by private jet, as he often did, a second, empty jet would often trail behind him in case of mechanical failures on the first plane. At its peak, GE was an industrial empire worth almost $600bn. When Immelt became CEO in 2001, he inherited one of the most valuable companies in the world. It was so trustworthy that it had a triple-A credit score, the same rating given to government debt. Fast forward two decades and that huge company is about to disappear. In November 2021, General Electric announced it would be broken up into smaller fragments. Over the previous few years its number of employees had fallen by more than half. The founder of GE, Thomas Edison, was credited with inventing the lightbulb. By the 2000s, the company had started sourcing its lightbulbs from Chinese contractors and branding them as GE products. In 2020, GE sold off its lighting business for good. William D Cohan’s new book, Power Failure, is a digressive history of what went wrong behind closed doors. Cohan, a business writer and former investment banker, covers almost a century of imperial expansion and errors of judgment. He focuses on the insular politics of the boardroom and the machinations of its executives, rarely pausing to consider the transformation that GE’s products or corporate culture wreaked on the wider world. Instead, Power Failure hinges on two antagonists: the late Jack Welch, the heedless, tyrannical chief executive who was said to advocate firing 10% of his workforce every year, and his successor Immelt, an obstinate sales manager who, as one of Cohan’s sources puts it, was merely “masquerading as a CEO”. Welch, the restless only son of working-class Irish-American parents, became CEO of GE a few months after Ronald Reagan became president. He was a qualified chemist, but his fortunes rose when he learned the art of financial engineering. Welch transformed GE Credit, a programme launched at the height of the Great Depression that allowed customers to buy appliances and pay for them later, into a financial powerhouse. Under his leadership, the company used its stellar credit rating to borrow cheaply in unsecured markets and lend this money to borrowers at higher interest rates, pocketing the difference. Welch often remarked how effortless it was: “I thought it was easier than bending metal,” he told Cohan, who worked for GE’s financial arm for two years when he was still in his 20s. “It was a home run.” He turned GE into a company that made money from money. Welch displayed a zealous concern for earnings targets (the Financial Times once called him the “number whisperer”). Often, he would reduce overheads by simply firing people (he fired more than 100,000 staff in his first few years as CEO), or by outsourcing GE’s work to other companies in countries with lower labour costs. But there was another, more contentious source of his uncanny ability to produce ever-increasing growth. The Wall Street Journal accused GE of engaging in “earnings management”, the practice of smoothing out gains and losses in order to produce the illusion of steadily rising profits on a balance sheet (accusations that Welch vehemently denied). In any case, he had created a company whose value was like a skyscraper built on sand, prone to crumbing as soon as the landscape beneath it shifted. Soon, the profits from GE Capital far outstripped those made from inventing things, or producing X-ray machines and jet propulsion engines. Immelt tried to stem the company’s reliance on financial speculation, but he ended up by inviting the enemy in. In 2015, Trian Partners, an asset management firm known for shaking up underperforming companies, became a top investor. Billionaire co-founder Nelson Peltz, who voted for Trump in 2016, was relentless in his pursuit of shareholder value, so it was perhaps inevitable that the firm would demand changes – including Immelt’s head. GE now has a new CEO, Larry Culp, who works closely with Peltz (neither spoke with Cohan for the book). Last year, Culp finally “pulled the plug on the company”. At more than 700 pages, Power Failure asks a lot of its reader. Halfway through, a blurry feeling settled over me as the narrative thread was unwound by detours about where particular executives went to university or whom they married. Cohan quotes at length from interviews with Welch, whose anecdotes feel a little too neat, as if you’re listening to a faded power broker recount their best stories across a bar. The rise and fall of GE is explained as the product of individual men and their mercurial decisions, yet its fate has a wider significance. It ought to be a warning: cost-cutting, outsourcing and financial speculation produce a warped model of value that is liable to collapse. • Power Failure: The Rise and Fall of an American Icon by William D Cohan is published by Penguin (£35).

Mutual inspections had been suspended as a health precaution since the start of the Covid pandemic, but a foreign ministry statement on Monday added another reason Russia is unwilling to restart them. It argued that US sanctions imposed because of the invasion of Ukraine stopped Russian inspectors travelling to the US. “There are no similar obstacles to the arrival of American inspectors in Russia,” the statement said. “The Russian foreign ministry raised this issue with the relevant countries, but did not receive an answer.” The US state department did not immediately respond to the claim that the sanctions created an imbalance when it came to nuclear weapons inspections. A spokesperson said: “The United States is committed to implementation of the New Start Treaty, but we keep discussions between the parties concerning treaty implementation confidential.” The treaty, which limits each country’s deployed strategic warheads to 1,550, and imposes limits on delivery systems, was extended for five years in February 2021. It is the last remaining arms control treaty in effect between the US and Russia, and its inspection and verification clauses are widely seen as vital in building mutual confidence and preventing nuclear miscalculation. “At a time when US and Russian relations are tense, anything that undermines stability and nuclear predictability is a concern,” said Jon Wolfsthal, who was senior director for arms control and nonproliferation in the Obama administration’s national security council. “However, we continue to exchange large volumes of information with Russia about their nuclear weapons. The hope is that this is just a political road bump and not a major new obstacle to stability.” While inspections have stalled, Russian nuclear forces have maintained another key part of the New Start agreement, notifications to the US on any movements or changes in status of its nuclear arsenal. “They’ve been stepping up notifications. It’s remarkable,” Rose Gottemoeller, former Nato deputy secretary general and under secretary of state for arms control and international security, said. “Notifications come in to something called the National and Nuclear Risk Reduction Centre, which is a centre headquartered in the department of state. They told me one day in May they got 18 notifications. They’ve never seen that number of notifications before,” Gottemoeller, now a lecturer at Stanford University, added. “So it seems like the Russians, at least the Russian nuclear forces, have been intent on trying to continue implementation for mutual predictability and confidence.” Inspections are important way of checking whether a country’s notifications on its nuclear weapons are accurate, but Pavel Podvig, a Geneva-based independent analyst on Russian nuclear forces, said they are not the only one. “First, the volume of notifications is sufficiently large so you should be able to detect serious discrepancies,” Podvig, who is also a senior researcher at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research, said. “Then, there are always national technical means – they cannot see everything, of course, but serious discrepancies will be detected … So, I wouldn’t say that all is lost for arms control, even though, of course, it’s a rather unfortunate decision on Russia’s part.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-429-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-28T18:11:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 429 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-429-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-429-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine’s forces are concluding their preparations for a long-expected spring counteroffensive against invading Russian troops, the country’s defence minister has said, and are, broadly speaking, ready. Oleksii Reznikov told an online briefing on Friday: “As soon as there is God’s will, the weather and a decision by commanders, we will do it.” He gave no date for when the counteroffensive would start but said: “Globally speaking, we are to a high percentage ready. Kyiv has been preparing a counterattack for several months aimed at repelling Russian forces from the east and south. The death toll from a Russian missile strike that hit a nine-storey block of flats in Uman, central Ukraine, has risen to 19, including two 10-year-old children, the regional governor, Igor Taburets, and other local officials have said. The announcement brings the total number of people killed in the wave of pre-dawn strikes to at least 21. Russian missiles also hit a home in the central city of Dnipro, where the city’s mayor, Borys Filatov, said a young woman and a three-year-old child had been killed. Vladimir Putin on Friday said Russia needed to act quickly and as a “cohesive team” to counter the west’s “economic aggression”, adding Moscow would expand ties with countries in Eurasia, Africa and Latin America. Russia’s economy has faced multiple challenges this year, including a weaker rouble, lower energy revenues and further isolation as western countries continue to impose an array of sanctions over its war in Ukraine. A leaked internal review commissioned by Amnesty International is said to have concluded there were significant shortcomings in a controversial report prepared by the rights group that accused Ukraine of illegally endangering citizens by placing armed forces in civilian areas. The report, issued last August, prompted widespread anger in Ukraine, leading to an apology from Amnesty and a promise of a review by external experts of what went wrong. Among those who condemned the report was Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who accused Amnesty of “shift[ing] the responsibility from the aggressor to the victim”. A Ukrainian journalist, who formerly worked for the BBC, has been killed fighting on the frontline. Oleksandr Bondarenko volunteered for Ukraine’s territorial defence after Russia invaded the country in February 2022. He later became part of the military. Details of how he was killed in action are not yet known, BBC News reports. Bondarenko, known as Sasha or Sashko, worked from 2007 to 2011 at the BBC’s Ukrainian service, broadcasting from Kyiv. His colleagues paid tribute to the “extraordinary” and “heroic” reporter and news presenter. The UK has signed a £1.9bn deal with Poland to provide the eastern European nation with a British-designed air defence system. Some 22 Polish air defence batteries will be equipped with Common Anti-Air Modular Missiles (CAMMs) and launchers as part of the arrangement. It expands on pre-existing defence ties with Poland, where CAMMs are already deployed with the British army following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia has informed the UN’s nuclear watchdog that equipment spotted at Ukraine‘s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), which Russia controls, will be used to fix a power transmission line that leads to Russian-held territory, the watchdog said on Friday. The planned restoration of the downed power line could heighten Ukrainian fears that Russia is preparing to connect Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, to the power grid of territory that it controls. A small number of International Atomic Energy Agency officials are present at the ZNPP, which is operated by Ukrainian staff working under the orders of Russian forces and the Russian nuclear company Rosatom. A UN committee said on Friday it was deeply concerned about human rights violations by Russian forces and private military companies in Ukraine, including enforced disappearances, torture, rape and extrajudicial executions, Reuters reports. In its findings on Russia, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called on the Russian authorities to investigate allegations of human rights violations committed during the invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree giving people living in parts of Ukraine that are under Moscow’s control a route to Russian citizenship – but also means those who decline it, or do not legalise their status, potentially face deportation. Reuters reports that the decree, which covers Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, the four regions Russia has claimed and partially controls, sets out ways that Ukrainian citizens living there – or those holding passports issued by Russia-backed breakaway republics – can start the process of becoming Russian citizens or legalise their status. Spain’s foreign ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador over a video shared on the embassy’s social media accounts that falsely portrayed Spanish troops fighting in Ukraine. Agence France-Presse cited Spanish media as saying the video, which has now been taken down, showed what the embassy claimed were Spanish soldiers on the battlefield, set against a clip of Spain’s defence minister, Margarita Robles, saying Spanish troops would never fight in Ukraine. Reports were emerging that the Russian colonel general Mikhail Mizintsev, known as the “butcher of Mariupol”, has been removed as deputy defence minister in charge of logistics and supplies. Reuters cites a military blogger, Alexander Sladkov, and the news website RBC as saying Mizintsev, who orchestrated the siege of the devastated city of Mariupol last year, was no longer in the role he was appointed to last September. The Kremlin has said Russian military units that have fought in Ukraine will be represented in a parade in Moscow on 9 May to mark the anniversary of the Soviet victory in the second world war, Reuters reports. The holiday is one of the most important in the Russian calendar, usually featuring a huge show of military hardware on Red Square and a speech from President Vladimir Putin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/17/iran-breaching-nuclear-deal-by-providing-russia-with-armed-drones-says-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-17T13:59:01Z","webTitle":"Iran breaching nuclear deal by providing Russia with armed drones, says UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/17/iran-breaching-nuclear-deal-by-providing-russia-with-armed-drones-says-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/17/iran-breaching-nuclear-deal-by-providing-russia-with-armed-drones-says-uk","fields":{"bodyText":"Britain has joined France in viewing the Iranian supply of armed drones to Russia for devastating use in Ukraine as a breach of Iran’s obligations under the 2015 nuclear deal. The joint view comes as EU foreign affairs ministers slapped human rights sanctions on the Iranian morality police over their handling of street protests and treatment of women. The drone strikes continued in Ukraine on Monday, killing three more people, according to the mayor of Kyiv. Despite the French-British belief that Iran is breaching the UN security council resolution that endorsed the nuclear deal by supplying the drones, there is no immediate plan to refer the issue to the UN, but diplomatic sources said the issue was live. A spokesperson for the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said Iran’s supply of drones to Russia constituted a breach of UN security council resolution 2231, which was unanimously adopted six days after the nuclear deal was signed in Vienna, and called on UN member states to refrain “from actions that undermine implementation of commitments”. “The UK has condemned Iran’s decision to supply drones and training to Russia. Iran supplying drones is inconsistent with UN security council resolution 2231 and is further evidence of the role Iran plays in undermining global security,” the spokesperson said. “The UK will continue to work with our partners to hold Iran to account for its destabilising behaviour around the world.” The French foreign ministry spokesperson last week revealed Paris had noted “a great deal of information that reports the use of Iranian drones by the Russian armed forces in Ukraine, in bombardments that were aimed at civilian targets”. Although a ban on Iranian arms exports expired in 2020, the nuclear deal signed in 2015, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPoA), retains a ban on any activity related to ballistic missiles until 2023. France and the UK say Iran, in supplying drones, is in breach of obligations under parts of the JCPoA and the missile technology control regime that limits the proliferation of missiles. The west has the ability to “snapback” on some sanctions if it asserts Iran is breaching the JCPoA. More practically it is inconceivable that the west will resume negotiations about renewing the nuclear deal so long as there is clear evidence that Iran is supplying arms to help Russia defeat Ukraine. The talks are effectively on hold until after the US midterm elections, even though Iran is continuing to expand its use of more sophisticated centrifuges. The Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Naser Kanani, in his weekly press conference again denied Iran was supplying drones to Russia, challenging claims by the US, Ukraine and many arms specialists that Iranian-manufactured Shahed-136 drones were in clear use. He said: “Iran has repeatedly declared that it is not a party to the war between Russia and Ukraine. Iran has not exported any weapons to any of the warring parties. As we have said many times, Iran’s foreign policy is based on opposing war, and regarding the war in Ukraine, we are also against war, and we are trying to end the military approach in this field.” The Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, has in the recent past spoken of a new military pact with Russia, but not referred to a specific deal on drone exports. Iranian journalists have repeatedly challenged the foreign ministry about its denials. The US warned on Monday that it would take action against companies and nations working with Iran’s drone program, describing the deepening alliance between Moscow and Tehran as “a profound threat”. “Anyone doing business with Iran that could have any link to UAVs or ballistic missile developments or the flow of arms from Iran to Russia should be very careful and do their due diligence – the US will not hesitate to use sanctions or take actions against perpetrators,” said a State Department spokesperson. Oleksiy Kuleba, the head of the Kyiv military administration, said last week that explosions at a military base 75km south of the city, wounding one, had been carried out by these drones. The highly effective “kamikaze” drones have been used with great effect, and are seen as a cheap alternative to missiles. EU foreign ministers imposed sanctions on 11 Iranian security officers and four entities including the morality police on Monday in response to the crackdown on protests triggered by the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurd. The EU list goes further than the recently announced British and US sanctions, but still stops short of the systematic attack on Iranian regime supporters and family members in Europe that is being sought by some Iranians. In common with Washington, the EU sanctioned Iran’s morality police and two of its key figures, Mohammad Rostami and Haj Ahmad Mirzaei. In addition, the EU designates the Iranian Law Enforcement Forces (LEF), as well as a number of its local chiefs, for their role in the repression of the protests. The EU also listed Issa Zarepour, the Iranian minister of information and communications technology, for his responsibility over the internet shutdown. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps cyber-defence command was also the subject of sanctions. Anoosheh Ashoori, one of the former British-Iranian dual nationals released from Evin prison after nearly five years in detention, said the west needed to go much further in enforcing sanctions. “There is no point imposing sanctions only on the morality police that are not going to come to Europe. But there are a large number of children and relatives of the regime that, like the Russian oligarchs, like living the high life here and have assets here. “Britain cannot have dealings with a regime that kills children and detains people for the amount of hair they show. This regime is brutal and has no red lines. Britain will be asked when this regime falls whether it was on the right side of history.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/feb/02/bristol-is-ready-to-give-us-power-greens-hopeful-of-win-in-pivotal-byelection","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-02T06:00:53Z","webTitle":"‘Bristol is ready to give us power’: Greens hopeful of win in pivotal byelection","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/02/bristol-is-ready-to-give-us-power-greens-hopeful-of-win-in-pivotal-byelection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/feb/02/bristol-is-ready-to-give-us-power-greens-hopeful-of-win-in-pivotal-byelection","fields":{"bodyText":"The issues that have been raised on the doorstep during the campaign have tended to be local ones – from concerns over new housing developments to the state of the pavements and plans to increase fees paid by people who live on boats in the harbour. But a council byelection taking place at Bristol city council on Thursday may have national implications should the Green party manage to pinch the ward from the Lib Dems. If the Greens do win – and they lost last time to the Lib Dems by only 26 votes – they would become the biggest party on Bristol city council, which they say would be a significant shift and one they believe would put them in pole position to eventually win power at city hall and a parliamentary seat at the next general election. “It does feel like an important moment,” said Carla Denyer, the co-leader of the Green party in England and Wales and herself a Bristol city councillor, speaking while out on the campaign trail in the ward, Hotwells and Harbourside. “For a start, it would be part of the trend of the Greens making gains here. The Greens are already the joint biggest group on Bristol city council with 24 councillors, the same as Labour. We know there’s a massive appetite for Green politics in Bristol.” Bristol is traditionally thought of as a Labour city but the Greens drew level, at least as far as the number of councillors was concerned, in May 2021. It means they already have more councillors in Bristol than in any other local authority. However, it did not lead to access to the levers of power as Bristol has a Labour directly elected mayor, Marvin Rees, and he resisted calls for Greens to be given cabinet posts. “He could have chosen to have a cross-party cabinet – he opted to have a 100% Labour cabinet,” said Denyer. She does not expect much to change immediately if the Greens win on Thursday. “I’m not holding my breath that he will hand over the keys of the city.” But major changes are afoot with the city voting last year to scrap the mayoral role, returning to a committee system from 2024. How this will work is being hammered out but a win at this byelection, followed by strong showings at the next council elections in May 2024, will help the Green cause. “I do think the direction of travel demonstrated by Green results in the last few elections shows Bristol is ready to give Greens power,” said Denyer. “There’s a change of the guard in the air.” Denyer is also the Green’s MP candidate for Bristol West. In the 2019 general election she came second, nearly doubling the Greens’ previous vote share. Of the 20 councillors in Bristol West, 16 are Greens and winning in Hotwells and Harbourside would make it 17. “It would a boost to our chances of winning the Bristol West seat,” said Denyer. She was out with the candidate for Hotwells and Harbourside, Patrick McAllister, who works locally in legal services, trying to persuade a few last “undecideds” that Green was the way to go. McAllister said he was determined to secure a fairer, greener future for his ward and the city. “People talk about those local issues – the housing developments, the boat charges and so on, but also about things like council tax going up and how they afford it at a time of a cost of living crisis.” The campaign has not been without controversies. The scandal of flammable cladding affects many residents in the ward, including the Labour candidate, Eileen Means, who has said resolving the issue will be her top priority. The Lib Dem’s Hotwells candidate, Stephen Williams, a former UK government junior minister in the Cameron-Clegg coalition, has accused the Greens of trying to “smear” him during the campaign by suggesting he could have done more to address fire safety issues when he was in power. “It shows how desperate they are.” Williams, who was Bristol West MP from 2005 to 2015 and has previously served as a city councillor, claimed the Greens had not really focused on important local issues during the campaign, such as plans to build hundreds of new harbourside homes and a controversial road scheme. “Almost the entire focus of their campaign has been: ‘Give us another councillor, then we’ll be really big’ and they’ve hardly been talking about local issues. There are 50 things they could have campaigned on. I’m puzzled. Ironically, they’ve been producing an avalanche of leaflets, a forest of them.” Thecandidates for the byelection are: Stephen Williams (Lib Dem), Patrick McAllister (Green), Eileen Means (Labour), Eliana Barbosa (Conservative), Martin Booth (Independent)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/dec/09/power-tools-are-scary-so-its-handheld-pruners-for-my-hedges","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-09T11:00:39Z","webTitle":"Power tools are scary so it’s handheld pruners for my hedges | Alys Fowler","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/09/power-tools-are-scary-so-its-handheld-pruners-for-my-hedges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/09/power-tools-are-scary-so-its-handheld-pruners-for-my-hedges","fields":{"bodyText":"I am drowning in prunings, tripping over the stuff every time I try to hang out the washing, and still I have yet to make even a dent in the hedge. If I were a different person I would either get someone else to do it, or at least buy myself the mother of all hedge trimmers and make light work of it all. But I am not that person. I am one who has a deep, and perhaps deeply un-lesbian, distrust of power tools. I just don’t like how fast they go. Thus, my only option is to spend the winter going at it bit by bit, by hand, until one day we can all see the light through the tangle of branches. I already own a Wolf-Garten multi-change tool with a telescopic handle that can reach up to three metres. I’ve got two heads for it: the adjustable anvil tree lopper that cuts through branches up to 40mm in diameter as if they are made of butter; and the professional pruning saw, which rips through anything big with such ease it is slightly terrifying. I can’t recommend these tools highly enough if you’ve got tall things to prune and no space or budget for a serious tripod ladder. You can also, if you have massive hands, take the pruning saw off and use it as a hand saw. If you don’t, I recommend the Silky Natanoko pruning saw from Japan, partly because its handle is smaller and made of rubber. This is a fixed-blade saw with coarse teeth, perfect for fresh wood. Like all Japanese saws, it cuts on the pull, which means it’s less effort, but you must make sure it doesn’t bend as you cut, otherwise it is liable to snap. If this does happen, at least you can replace the blades and, more importantly, you can sharpen them too. It’s an investment, at more than £60, but should last a lifetime if looked after well. If that’s too much, a Z pruning saw with coarse serrations is a very reasonable second choice, costing just over £20. On top of that you’ll need some loppers. I’ve tried many in my time and think most telescopic sorts are just not tough enough. Bypass loppers are great for smaller stuff (under 300mm diameter), but for bigger branches you need to buy the sturdiest anvil loppers you can find, such as a pair of Bulldog compound anvil lopping shears. Then put on a good podcast and get chopping. And all those prunings? Make a deadhedge (a hedge-like collection of pruned branches) or just an artful pile with the bigger stuff, and let it slowly rot back. Dead wood is hugely important to beetles and other insects. The small stuff will rot quickly enough in the compost if it is added fresh."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/11/uk-coal-burning-power-plant-to-stay-open-two-years-longer-than-planned","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-11T23:16:57Z","webTitle":"UK coal-burning power facility to stay open two years longer than planned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/11/uk-coal-burning-power-plant-to-stay-open-two-years-longer-than-planned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/11/uk-coal-burning-power-plant-to-stay-open-two-years-longer-than-planned","fields":{"bodyText":"Part of a Nottinghamshire coal-burning power plant will stay open for two years beyond its planned closure date after a call from ministers prompted by the UK’s energy crisis. Ratcliffe-on-Soar had initially been pencilled in to shut in 2022, but last year said it would have an initial extension until 31 March 2023. The planned closure forms part of the government’s attempt to remove coal from Britain’s energy generation to cut carbon emissions. One of the four units at Ratcliffe-on-Soar was due to shut in September 2022, but it will now close in line with three other units at the station in September 2024. Coal-fired plants provided more than 40% of Britain’s electricity a decade ago, but that figure had fallen to 1.5% by last year. Ministers have set a goal for Britain to stop using coal altogether. However, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 led to countries boycotting Russian gas. Emergency contracts were drawn up between energy suppliers and National Grid to keep stations open as back-up options. So far none of the coal-fire powered stations asked to stay online this winter as a precaution have been asked to supply power, the Daily Telegraph reports. The power station and its distinctive eight concrete cooling towers can be seen next to the Midland mainline railway line between London and Leeds. The news comes as Britain generated a record amount of electricity from wind turbines on Tuesday. National Grid data showed that 21.6GW of electricity was supplied by wind early in the evening, about 50% of the power needed across Britain at 6pm and 6.30pm. This is a time of day where demand is traditionally high, as people return from work or start to prepare evening meals. It is the second time in two weeks that the wind record has been broken in Britain, after a previous best was set on 30 December. The German energy giant Uniper, which owns the Nottinghamshire plant, said: “As requested by the government, Uniper is now looking at whether we can make the unit available to run under standard market arrangements until the September 2024 coal phase-out date. “We have prequalified the unit to take part in the capacity market T-1 auction for 2023/24 [an auction for back-up power]. This means further investment to extend the life of the unit. The power station is set to close at the end of September 2024.” A government spokesman said: “The UK has a secure and diverse energy system, and we remain confident in our security of supply. “Working closely with Ofgem, National Grid Gas and other key industry organisations, we continuously monitor our energy supply and ensure we are ready for a range of scenarios. “In line with our net zero target, the government is planning to phase out unabated coal-fired power generation by the end of 2024.” • This article was amended on 12 January and 13 January 2023 to clarify in the text and headline that three of the four units at Ratcliffe-on-Soar were already due to remain open until 2024."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/25/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-183-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-25T17:41:18Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 183 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/25/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-183-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/25/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-183-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station was temporarily taken off the Ukrainian power grid. The plant in eastern Ukraine is under Russian occupation and was disconnected from the national power supply for several hours before a last remaining line supplying electricity that cools the reactors was reconnected. Disconnecting the plant raises the risk of catastrophic failure of cooling systems for its reactors and spent fuel rods, which run on electricity. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to increase the size of Russia’s armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million, Reuters has cited the Russian state-owned news agency Ria as saying. The figure, which includes a 137,000 increase in the number of military personnel to 1.15 million, will come into effect on 1 January. The death toll from Russia’s rocket strike on a Ukrainian train station has risen to 25 people. Russian forces attacked a train in the village of Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk oblast on Wednesday. Four trains caught fire and the deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, reported on Telegram that two children were killed in the attack. Russia has since confirmed it was behind the attack. Russia’s defence ministry confirmed its forces struck the railway station, prompting condemnation from the US and the EU. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the attack “fits a pattern of atrocities” while the EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, said those responsible would be held to account. The UN’s human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, has called on Vladimir Putin to stop the war in Ukraine and its “unimaginably terrifying” impact on civilians. Bachelet spoke about the six months since the Russian leader ordered his troops into Ukraine during a speech marking the end of her term as the UN’s high commissioner for human rights. The mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, has said a building allegedly used by Russian-backed officials in the region has been “blown up”. Fedorov, who is not in the city, posted a video on Telegram reportedly showing damage to the building, which he said was being used to plan a “pseudo-referendum” by Russia-backed authorities on whether the region should join Russia. The head of the Kyiv regional military administration said Russia launched a rocket attack on the region’s Vyshgorod district north of the city centre early on Thursday morning. Oleksiy Kuleba said there were so far no casualties or damage to residential buildings or infrastructure facilities. Ukraine’s armed forces said “several” explosions were heard at about 3am. The US president, Joe Biden, was set to speak to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, after the announcement of a further $3bn (£2.5bn) in US military aid for Ukraine. John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the national security council, said the phone call would also provide the Ukrainian president with an update on US arms shipments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/26/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-ukraine-russia-europe-radiation-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-26T01:28:06Z","webTitle":"Nuclear plant came close to ‘radiation disaster’, says Zelenskiy, amid calls for urgent UN visit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/26/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-ukraine-russia-europe-radiation-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/26/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-ukraine-russia-europe-radiation-disaster","fields":{"bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the world narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster” as the last regular line supplying electricity to Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was restored hours after being cut by shelling. The Ukranian president said officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear watchdog, must be given urgent access to the site. Zelenskiy blamed shelling on Thursday by Russia’s military for fires in the ash pits of a nearby coal power station that disconnected the reactor complex, Europe’s largest such facility, from the power grid. He said back-up diesel generators ensured power supply and kept the plant safe. “If our station staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would have already been forced to overcome the consequences of a radiation accident,” he said in an evening address. “Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster.” IAEA officials should be given access to the site within days, he said, “before the occupiers take the situation to the point of no return”. Negotiations are under way for the UN’s nuclear watchdog to visit the site, and Ukraine’s top nuclear official told the Guardian that IAEA inspectors could arrive by the end of the month. Until then, continued fighting puts the plant, and potentially much of Europe, at risk. A nuclear accident could spread radiation far across the continent. Ukrainian state nuclear company Energoatom said Thursday’s incident represented the plant’s first complete disconnection in its nearly 40 years of operation. Electricity is used for cooling and safety systems. Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February, captured the plant in March and has controlled it since, although Ukrainian technicians still operate it. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling the site, fuelling fears of a nuclear disaster. The White House called on Russia to agree to a demilitarised zone around the plant, after Joe Biden spoke to Zelenskiy on Thursday. The US state department also cautioned Russia against redirecting energy from the site. “The electricity that it produces rightly belongs to Ukraine and any attempt to disconnect the plant from the Ukrainian power grid and redirect to occupied areas is unacceptable,” spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters. “No country should turn a nuclear power plant into an active war zone and we oppose any Russian efforts to weaponise or divert energy from the plant.” The IAEA said Ukraine had informed it the plant temporarily lost connection, “further underlining the urgent need for an IAEA expert mission to travel to the facility”. “We can’t afford to lose any more time. I’m determined to personally lead an IAEA mission to the plant in the next few days,” the organisation’s director general, Rafael Grossi, said. Writing on Telegram, Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in the occupied town of Enerhodar near the plant, said satellite photos showed the local forest in flames. He said towns in the area lost power for several hours on Thursday. “This was caused by the disconnection of power lines from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station as a result of provocations by Zelenskiy’s fighters,” Rogov claimed. “The disconnection itself was triggered by a fire and short circuit on the power lines.” Nuclear experts have warned of the risk of damage to the plant’s spent nuclear fuel pools or its reactors. Cuts in the power needed to cool the pools could cause a disastrous meltdown. There have been growing international concerns about safety at Europe’s largest nuclear plant. It has been occupied by Russian forces since the start of the war, and they are now using it to house military vehicles and equipment. The complex supplied more than 20% of Ukraine’s electricity needs and its loss would pile new strain on the government. The head of Energoatom’s told the Guardian on Wednesday that Russian engineers had drawn up a blueprint to permanently disconnect the plant from the national grid and connect it to the Russian power network instead. Petro Kotin said the plan was ostensibly aimed at maintaining power supply to the plant if all connections to Ukraine were cut off by fighting, as they were on Thursday. But Ukraine fears Russia may deliberately cut the lines. Russian and Ukrainian forces have reached a relative stalemate in recent months, partly after the west supplied new long-range missiles that have hampered Russia’s supply lines and ability to continue with its offensives. Ukraine says it also does not have the weapons it needs to launch a decisive counteroffensive.

Thanks to modern legislation on child sexual abuse, 55 years on some of the issues raised in this case are no longer risks; but many dangers remain in the television and film sector today. I have worked in the industry for almost as long as an intimacy coordinator can have, given that the role officially originated in 2017. In that time, I’ve choreographed a wide range of intimate scenes – from sci-fi orgies to medieval childbirth. I’ve worked with child actors (who are defined in the UK as those under school leaving age) in scenes where consent and boundaries are needed, for example where children are cuddled or kissed by adult actors playing their parents. Ensuring informed consent when working with an underaged actor is morally ambiguous at best, but there are some hard lines. Child actors cannot legally consent for themselves, nor can they legally perform nude on camera, especially not in a sexual context. Hussey and Whiting were 15 and 16, respectively, when they were filmed naked in Zeffirelli’s classic, ages that would exclude them from the same situation today. A child actor may be made aware of the full context of a scene or they may not be – depending on their age, parent/guardian’s guidance, and the recommendations of a child psychologist. Consent of a parent/guardian is always required, but depending on the age and maturity of a young actor, they may have a limited ability to understand what they are being asked to do, or the potential consequences of their performance living on in perpetuity. Even for adult actors who consent to onscreen nudity or simulated sex, there are complications. How can we be fully confident any actor won’t feel differently about their performance a day, a week or even 50 years down the line? The short answer: there are no guarantees. Part of the intimacy coordinator’s role is to help mitigate this risk as much as possible – not only to protect the actor, but to protect the production’s liability as well. Establishing clear, transparent communication around intimate content early in production is paramount. Ideally, an intimacy coordinator is brought on prior to the casting process, helping ensure that any actor accepting a role with scripted intimacy is doing so from a place of informed consent from the very start. However, I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve been hired to aid in a casting process this way. In the case of Hussey and Whiting, it appears that in early conversations they were assured that they would not have to perform nude. Later in the shoot, Zeffirelli reportedly changed his mind. Here is where fraught dynamics embedded in the industry continue to permeate and create risk. Often, a director or producer will emphasise that they’ve spoken with an actor who is “fine” or “totally chill” about intimate content, but when the actor has the opportunity to speak with me, they may express significantly different comfort levels. Even with the best of intentions or the most trusting working relationship, the implicit power held by someone well-connected with reverential status who is perceived as a gatekeeper to a notoriously impenetrable industry – and who may have hiring and firing power over an actor who has probably jumped through countless hoops just to get in the room – is undeniable.The most frequent mishandlings of intimacy by productions seem to arise when time pressures and last-minute changes come into play. The job of a producer is to make a project achievable, however they can. The entire production team is composed of creative problem solvers, masters of the quick pivot. However, when these last-minute changes affect the timing or content of an intimate scene, this time pressure is suddenly transferred to an actor and their boundaries. Often it is presented as though there is no other option, no possible solution besides a change to the intimate scene. Productions can make this feel like a monolithic pressure for an actor – or even an intimacy coordinator – to push back on. Despite huge strides made in our understanding of consent, trauma and power since the Weinstein scandal and rise of #MeToo, the TV and film industry remains reluctant to change in some key ways. Many professionals still fail to see why the risks of psychological injury on set deserve the same attention as the risks of physical injury. For actors, who rely on their emotional capacity to do their jobs, a psychological trauma on set can be career-ending (see Last Tango in Paris for a harrowing example). We are going to have to learn to not only change the way we think and talk about consent, but consider what compromises we are willing to make to ensure it is maintained. In the US, Screen Actors Guild contracts are governed by a 48-hour rule: any changes to the content or scope of an intimate scene need to be submitted to an actor’s agent at least 48 hours in advance of filming. This is not yet a legal requirement in the UK, though it is generally considered best practice. I look forward to best practice becoming typical practice. Even with improved legislation, Hollywood has a power problem, and cases like Hussey and Whiting’s remind us that this is nothing new. Unfortunately, it is not, yet, entirely old either. The solution is not only for productions to hire specialists like intimacy coordinators (and access coordinators, and wellbeing coordinators), but to listen and consistently implement their expertise, instead of enlisting them solely as a tick-box exercise. As an industry we need to demonstrate our true willingness to upend some of the longstanding traditions of unhealthy working environments once affectionately written off as “showbiz, baby!”.

In addition to Botatouille, which BuzzFeed describes as, “the first AI-powered culinary companion” that suggests recipes based on factors like what you already have in your refrigerator, there’s also a chatbot feature that allows people to ask culinary questions while they cook, according to a press release from the company. Botatouille, which doesn’t appear to be inspired by the Disney movie about the cartoon rat-chef, is part of a slew of AI-generated content like games and quizzes that BuzzFeed hopes will drive users back to their platform as the brand shut down its award-winning news division earlier this month. BuzzFeed, chief executive Jonah Peretti told investors on 11 May, will “focus on making the internet more fun”. “Readers are sick of all the negative news in their social media feeds,” Peretti told investors. “They will increasingly want social media platforms to provide an escape where they can find entertainment, joy and fun.” BuzzFeed had already told employees in January it had used AI to ‘enhance’ its content and quizzes. Peretti announced the end of BuzzFeed News last month, a move that came after several rounds of deep cuts. The division had won a Pulitzer prize in 2021 for an investigation into China’s mass detention of Muslims. Peretti cited a range of challenges, including the pandemic, declining stock market, a slowdown in digital advertising and changing audience habits. The move was met with deep disappointment from the company’s staff, sharp criticisms of Peretti’s leadership with managing the company and arguments that the layoffs were another example of corporate leadership’s devaluation of workers and eagerness to embrace AI as a replacement for humans. Other news sites that boomed during the 2010s, including Vice and Insider have also struggled as audiences and advertisers moved away from social media and towards video services such as YouTube and TikTok. Insider – formerly known as Business Insider – also announced it was making substantial job cuts the same week that Peretti announced the layoffs at BuzzFeed. After a wave of layoffs and cancelation of its flagship news program, on 15 May Vice filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/jun/09/rishi-sunak-ai-summit-what-is-its-aim-and-is-it-really-necessary","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-09T12:51:10Z","webTitle":"Rishi Sunak’s AI summit: what is its aim, and is it really necessary?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/09/rishi-sunak-ai-summit-what-is-its-aim-and-is-it-really-necessary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/jun/09/rishi-sunak-ai-summit-what-is-its-aim-and-is-it-really-necessary","fields":{"bodyText":"Rishi Sunak has announced that the UK will host a global summit on safety in artificial intelligence in the autumn, as fears grow that the technology’s rapid advancement could spin out of control. Safety concerns are mounting after breakthroughs in generative AI, which can produce convincing text, images and even voice on command, with tech executives such as Elon Musk among the figures expressing alarm. Here is a look at what the summit might achieve. What is the aim of the summit? The prime minister has changed his tone on AI in recent weeks. Having been overwhelmingly optimistic about the opportunities it creates, he has begun to talk about its “existential risks”. Sunak is trying to position the UK as the natural hub for efforts to regulate the industry on a global scale, one that can provide a bridge between the US and China, and to offer an alternative to what some consider to be the EU’s heavy-handed approach. Described as the “first major global summit on AI safety”, the government says it will consider the risks the technology poses and discuss how they can be mitigated through “internationally coordinated action”. Is internationally coordinated action needed? Industry professionals harbour concerns about AI and have issued warnings about the dangers it poses. Elon Musk was one of more than 50,000 signatories to a letter in March that called for an immediate pause in the development of “giant” AIs, alongside the creation of “robust AI governance systems”. Concern about a possible existential threat from a system that human intervention cannot control by human intervention is not universal though. Many in the tech industry argue that the focus should be more immediate, for instance by focusing on the potential for generative AI, which can provide plausible imitations of text, images and voice that could produce destabilising disinformation during elections. What would a global framework look like? The UN-brokered treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, which came into force in 1970, is an example of a global attempt to mitigate an existential threat. The treaty, to which 191 states are signatories, commits those that have nuclear weapon states to not helping those who do not acquire or build them. The International Atomic Energy Agency oversees compliance through inspections. The treaty also promotes the spread of peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The letter calling for a six-month pause in AI development offers an insight into what might go into such a framework. It calls for dedicated regulatory authorities, public funding for safety research, and oversight and tracking of powerful systems. Would a nuclear arms-style framework succeed with AI? As with nuclear weapons, the technology that such a framework would seek to contain is already out there and proliferating. The chatbot phenomenon ChatGPT reached 100 million users within two months of its launch and a now-famous fake image of the pope wearing a Balenciaga jacket has underlined the power of generative AI to deceive. One of Google’s engineers warned last month that the company could lose out to open-source AI technology. Such developers release their work for anyone to use, improve or adapt as they see fit, making it difficult for a framework to curb the use of open-source models. China is likely to be excluded from the UK summit, which will be open to technology companies and “like-minded countries”. This indicates that an international framework to place guardrails around AI development will not have the participation of a global tech and AI powerhouse. What is happening in AI regulation already? The EU has made significant strides in the area and is proposing legislation that will be seen a pacesetter for AI regulation, confirming the bloc’s status as a leading tech regulator. The UK’s AI white paper sets out a set of principles to which the industry should adhere, but offers little in the way of concrete rules to govern it. Ministers disappointed some experts by resisting the idea of creating a new regulator to focus exclusively on AI. The G7 has agreed to create an intergovernmental forum called the “Hiroshima AI process” to debate issues around fast-growing tools."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/nov/28/nationwides-rules-unable-use-power-of-attorney","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-28T07:00:19Z","webTitle":" Nationwide’s rules left me unable to use my power of attorney","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/nov/28/nationwides-rules-unable-use-power-of-attorney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/nov/28/nationwides-rules-unable-use-power-of-attorney","fields":{"bodyText":"My mother has dementia and now lives in a care home, so I have a power of attorney (POA) to manage her finances.

This is my mother’s money and we need it to pay for her care in the medium term. At first, Nationwide would not speak to me or answer my letters and emails because they said I needed to register the POA with their specialist team. However, they could not do this because the account is closed and there are no others in her name. My mother’s post is redirected to my address and I need to know if a cheque was issued by Nationwide and, if it was, what has happened to it. My mother can’t sort this out herself. But like many organisations, Nationwide is difficult to deal with. They don’t answer letters and emails, take ages to answer the phone and do not publish useful information on their website. I have raised a formal complaint but can you help? JT, Cockermouth You found yourself in a catch-22 situation because you could not register your POA with Nationwide as your mother’s only account with it had been closed. The matter was complicated by the building society’s use of your mother’s old address and the mysterious disappearance of the cheque in the post. Nationwide says: “Unfortunately, the power of attorney and address changes weren’t actioned alongside the Isa maturity instructions. This meant that when the cheque didn’t arrive, our member’s daughter was unable to speak to us to resolve the matter. We have now cancelled the original cheque and sent the funds directly to the daughter’s account. We have also contacted her to apologise that her experience fell below our usual high standards and have offered her £200 compensation, which she has accepted.” You are relieved that this problem is resolved but point out that your mother is one of many whose affairs are being managed by a relative and complain that Nationwide failed to engage with you.

The US billionaire and philanthropist told the Lowy Institute on Monday that while malaria still killed more children – 400,000 a year – the climate crisis was “worth investing in massively because it will get worse and worse over time”. There was “no chance” of limiting warming to the Paris climate goal of 1.5C compared with pre-industrial levels, and it was “very unlikely” it could be kept to 2C, Gates said. “The key is to minimise the warming as much as possible,” he said. “At this point, to stay below 2.5C would be pretty fantastic. I do think that’s possible.” Gates remains among the world’s richest people, despite having donated $US35bn ($50bn) to mid-2022, with his former wife, Melinda Gates, and pledging another $US20bn. Asked about the policies of the government led by Anthony Albanese, whom Gates met over the weekend, the Microsoft founder said it was “great to have Australia on board on climate” after the country had been an “outlier until quite recently”. The country was “very blessed” with renewable energy resources and the minerals needed for a transition away from carbon. “Australia is rare in that the opportunities exceed what you have to give up,” he said. Gates said his investment in the Perth-based firm Rumin8, announced on Monday, was his 103rd foray into climate start-ups, from energy and aircraft to steel. Rumin8 aims to reduce methane emissions from cattle. Nuclear fission and fusion were both “very, very promising” energy sources not dependent on the weather for generation, he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Still, he said the government’s approach to wait 15 years for proof that the technology of small modular reactors was safe and cheap and the waste can be handled “was a very good attitude”. “I don’t know whether it will succeed,” he said. “I’ve put billions of dollars into [nuclear technology], so I must think there’s some chance.” “Even if nuclear succeeds, we’re still going to need 60-70% renewables,” Gates said. “I think the world is underinvested in those [nuclear] innovations because they could make a huge difference.” On other issues, Gates said there were still “huge factors pushing for global trade”, even with a “fear of dependency on China”. These include the cross-border need for copper, lithium and cobalt “as part of the green energy revolution”. “It is sad that we’re evolving into a world where [there’s] the willingness, certainly of the US, to be independent of things from China,” he said. “It will create significant inefficiencies if globalisation goes into reverse.” Still, Gates said he was hopeful that major advances were still possible to tackle many health and other issues. “We will cure obesity, we will cure cancer, we will eradicate polio,” he said. “I’m still very optimistic that it will be much better to be born 20, 40, 60 years from now than [at] any time in the past.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/17/it-cant-be-left-to-the-market-the-closure-of-the-liddell-power-station-and-the-uncertainty-of-the-future","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-17T01:00:25Z","webTitle":"‘It can’t be left to the market’: the closure of Liddell power station and uncertainty of the future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/17/it-cant-be-left-to-the-market-the-closure-of-the-liddell-power-station-and-the-uncertainty-of-the-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/17/it-cant-be-left-to-the-market-the-closure-of-the-liddell-power-station-and-the-uncertainty-of-the-future","fields":{"bodyText":"When AGL Energy was in a tangle with the Turnbull government over the future of its Liddell power station in 2017, it drew up an extensive scheme listing how it would replace the coal-fired plant with equivalent generation capacity. The Generation Plan proposed a mix of renewable energy, gas-peaking plants and battery storage, some of which would be on or near Liddell’s site in the New South Wales Hunter Valley. Its sister coal-fired power station, Bayswater, would also get an upgrade. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup AGL’s then chief executive, Andy Vesey, estimated the capital investment would total almost $1.4bn, with the new assets operating for as long as 30 years. By contrast, extending Liddell’s life beyond its planned 2022 closure would cost $920m and only add five years to a plant then almost 50 years old. As events transpired, the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and Vesey both got rolled on the same day, 24 August 2018. “They lost their PM over energy and we lost a CEO,” one AGL insider says. With Liddell finally shutting on 28 April, business leaders and local officials are hopeful alternative generation projects and manufacturing will eventually fill the site even if few of AGL’s proposed ventures have progressed. “There was initially a level of ‘this is going to be a bit of a shock to the system’,” says Danny Eather, president of Business Singleton, which represents about 180 local businesses. “Liddell is really beyond its lifespan as a facility, and I think there’s a general acceptance within the community that this is what had to happen.” Mike Kelly, president of the Muswellbrook Chamber of Commerce and Industry, further up the Hunter Valley, says it’s still unclear what will replace Liddell. “Despite the early notice [of Liddell’s demise], driven by government policy, there is still a lot of uncertainty and cynicism,” Kelly says. “You wouldn’t turn off the town water supply to your house if you were planning to put in big tanks next year,” he says. “And you wouldn’t turn off the grid main supply if you’re planning to put solar panels and wind turbines on your property in the next year or two or five.” Authorities, though, are confident Liddell’s shutdown won’t disrupt the power grid. The Australian Energy Market Operator forecasts the state “will maintain a reliable power supply”, says Penny Sharpe, the state’s new energy minister. “Liddell is now more than 50 years old. It’s been unreliable for many years, and not operating at its rated capacity,” Sharpe says. “In 2022, Liddell made around 1,260 megawatts available, a fraction of its 2,000MW rated capacity, and generated only around 7,000 gigawatt-hours across the year.” Vesey’s successor at AGL, Brett Redman, became much more cautious about the rush to invest in new renewables. Plans for a gas-peaker plant near Goulburn and one in the lower Hunter were scrapped altogether, while investments in new batteries and pumped hydro plants at Liddell or nearby have taken longer than expected, insiders say. Management wanted “no additional risk” for coal generation, one of them says. “What was happening in the background was that the business was haemorrhaging cash.” Also disrupting AGL’s intentions were interventions in the market by the Turnbull and then Morrison governments, not least Snowy Hydro’s giant Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project and then its Kurri Kurri gas plant in NSW. These threw the whole Generation Plan “out of the window”, they say. Markus Brokhof, AGL’s chief operating officer, is keen to see people move on from that earlier plan. “Forget about this, it is history,” he said during a recent visit to Liddell. Brokhof is proud Bayswater has been able to absorb 100 of Liddell’s 140 staff, meaning AGL kept its promise there would be no forced redundancies. The rest will retire or leave the industry. Bayswater’s crew of 460 will swell to 560, with contractors and sub-contractors being cut to make way for the newcomers. AGL aims to make a final investment decision on a 500MW battery for Liddell “probably in the second half of this year”, Brokhof says. A second battery of the same size may be a future option for a site near the Tomago aluminium smelter, AGL’s biggest customer, also in the Hunter region. A 250MW pumped hydro project about 11km from Liddell that would use a deep coalmine void created by Japan’s Idemitsu Corporation remains at the feasibility study stage. “We are exploring double that [size],” Brokhof says. Hydrogen production is another option for a post-Liddell future. AGL last year expanded a feasibility study involving Andrew Forrest’s Fortescue Future Industries and other partners to explore development of a green hydrogen and ammonia production facility. Luring other manufacturers to a site well-served with high voltage transmission, roads and railway is another aim of AGL’s. Agriculture may even feature, Brokhof says. A mining engineer by training, Brokhof hails from Dusseldorf, part of the Ruhr region of Germany that has been navigating a transition off mining and heavy industry for decades. “There are thousands of templates” about how to help communities adjust, he said, while walking near Lake Liddell. “Australia is not an island. It’s a bit annoying.” Another insider says locals should expect news of a “big deal” later this year about other companies willing to bring investments. AGL’s Liddell-Bayswater site, bought from the state government for $1.5bn in 2014, covers 10,000 hectares and also about 40% of the high-security water rights in the Hunter. The water licences, linked to the power stations, are among the largest in Australia and roughly equal the total water available to farms and mines in the valley. However, the area’s transition away from fossil fuels may need to speed up, particularly if Bayswater’s closure is brought forward and the mines start to shut. “The latest is 2033,” Brokhof says, referring to the shutdown timing of the 2,640MW plant. The end of a relatively low-cost coal contract in 2028, however, could challenge Bayswater’s economics before then. A reduced operation, such as retaining just one or more of the four units, may be the result, people familiar with the plant say. Steve Reynolds, mayor of Muswellbrook, worries the community won’t be ready for what is coming. “We’re in for a turbulent time, there’s no doubt, with the transformation that is going to happen across this region,” Reynolds says. “We really need that person from the state government, specifically, that’s going to assist us because there’s so many different departments that are siloed under environmental minister, the mining regulator [and so on],” he says. “If we miss this boat, it will be the generations to come that will pay for their failures.” Michele O’Neil, the Australian Council of Trade Unions president, says a national energy transition authority is required to improve coordination. “This is something we should have done at least a decade ago and we’ve left many communities without the support needed,” she says. Such a body could help diversify the economy “and create good secure long-term jobs well before closures happen”, O’Neil says. “It can’t just be left up to the market”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/dec/19/the-winner-is-qatar-project-hard-football-power-world-cup-2022","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-19T20:00:27Z","webTitle":"The winner is … Qatar: curtain comes down on Project Hard Football Power | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/19/the-winner-is-qatar-project-hard-football-power-world-cup-2022","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/dec/19/the-winner-is-qatar-project-hard-football-power-world-cup-2022","fields":{"bodyText":"“And the winner is … Qatar!” It all began with those words, read out in a tone of strangled gaiety by Sepp Blatter on stage at Fifa house. Twelve years on Qatar 2022 has now concluded with the same phrase hanging in the air. Project Hard Football Power is complete. And it really could not have gone any better, a micromanaged power play, from the pharaonic-scale nation-building project, to the painted backdrop sets, to the regional visibility that helped see Qatar through the blockade years, to the chance at the death to parade Lionel Messi around the winners’ enclosure like a beaming Guy Fawkes dummy. The winner is ... Qatar! There were layers to that moment of ignition back in December 2010. Blatter’s strange tone spoke to the fact that he also knew he was reading out his own redundancy note, that Qatar’s victory indicated he, Blatter, had lost control of the show. Standing there stiff as a board, Blatter nudged Jérôme Valcke, who looked as if he was about to cry, and ordered him to smile. On the back of that moment the house of Blatter would fall, the regime of the more opaque and unknowable Gianni Infantino would rise. And that stage of the cycle is now done. The most costly, carbon-heavy, bloodstained, corruption-shadowed event in the history of global sport is a wrap. But what does it mean? And what next? Qatar 2022 also signalled the end of a few other things. For starters, the end of the pretence, and it was always a pretence, that there is any kind of innocence about Fifa’s World Cup; that this is anything other than a marauding city state, out there circling the globe looking for the next compliant and complicit host to share in its gluttony. Qatar has transformed football: you also hear this a lot. In reality Qatar has simply supercharged what was already there, presented us with football’s standard corruption and hypocrisy stripped of artifice and gleamingly unapologetic. Qatar didn’t invent this world, didn’t invent migrant labour, didn’t invent global capitalism. It is simply the most zealous of late adopters, selling brutal carbon-fed hyper-capitalism back to the world in its final form, like the Beatles taking rock and roll to America. On a more micro level the end of this World Cup is also the end of a generation of great players, perhaps even an end to the age of the modern-day individualist, a lineage that runs though Ronaldinho to Messi. Football is more compressed, more systems-led, more controlled than ever. It seems possible the highest stage may never again see a baggy, strolling 35-year-old conjurer of patterns. Similarly Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Luka Modric, Karim Benzema, Robert Lewandowski, goodnight ladies, sweet ladies, good night. And for now, as the comedown starts to bite, there are probably three things worth saying about Qatar 2022. First, the football was excellent. The action on the pitch was luminous, packed with drama and topped with the greatest World Cup final ever staged. There is no meaning to this, no moral to be drawn. The World Cup was good because football is good. This is why Qatar paid $220bn to borrow its light. It is why Fifa will rake in $7bn revenue from the show. This thing is supernaturally resilient, no matter how hard we may try to bend it out of shape. There has been a lot of talk about the breadth and reach of this World Cup, the idea of new powers, a new world order. It is a good propaganda line for the organisers and host broadcasters. In reality eight of the last 16, five of the last eight, two of the final four were European nations. We did get Morocco and the thrill of a first African semi-finalist but even this is more complex. This was also a diaspora triumph, a triumph of expert management and fine domestic facilities, combined with multiculturalism. Seven starting players were products of European club academies and European childhoods, gelled into place with a Moroccan sense of togetherness that seemed to offer a model of how to live these many identities. This story is more nuanced, more interesting than simple parping regionalism. Otherwise the entertainment was derived from dramatic finishes and in-game tension as much as high quality. Take away Messi and there were no really exceptional teams outside France and Argentina. England, Croatia and Morocco were the second rank here. This is some pretty functional football. But they produced great games, plenty of goals, good refereeing and a welcome absence of red cards. Fernando Santos single-handedly saved football by dropping Ronaldo and playing a 21-year-old who scored a hat-trick, one of the great managerial flexes of all time. Croatia were a captivating bunch of super-smart dinosaurs. Brazil did Brazil. And it was all a good job too because a bad World Cup on the pitch might just have fatally wounded the whole idea of international football given the backdrop to this thing. Otherwise Messi wrote the story of Qatar 2022 and did so while manifesting the key paradox of Big Football. Here is a player whose talent expresses freedom, beauty, love, imagination, uplifting human qualities. Messi is basically a sporting unicorn – and a highly unusual unicorn, the kind of unicorn even other unicorns look at and say: ‘That unicorn, he’s a bit special.’ Often the word “player” can feel like a ludicrous anachronism. Play is fun, joy, gratuitous things. Modern football, meanwhile, is a suffocating matrix, all constriction and physicality. Somehow Messi, the greatest footballer of the age, is also a player. At the same time his professional existence is still lived out as a tool of despotic regimes, pegged out around the commoditised global game. Messi is the face of Qatar’s propaganda World Cup. Messi is Saudi Arabia’s tourism ambassador. It is almost an act of unintended rebellion to be all these things and to perform the way he does, the rebel heart to Argentinian football expressed not through any conscious act of will, not through guns and cops and drugs, but through a way of playing, the whisper of a free spirit. Aside from all this, we still have the death. Not to mention suffering, corruption and grotesque monarchical vanity. So many things at this World Cup have seemed to be screaming in horror, from the open mouths of the gleaming stadium roofs, to the frightening cartoon avatars of the Bein Sports graphics, to the mind-numbing universal public address system. The stage was haunted by ghosts. The People’s World Cup was also the dead people’s World Cup. We can argue over the final tally, which is also part of the horror, the lack of care, death as part of life, in the words of the dear old Supreme Delivery Committee. But this has been football as an accessory of the overclass world, football as VVIP product. There are other costs. An otherworldly chill settled over Lusail Iconic Stadium an hour before kick-off in the World Cup final. Rain? Guilt? No, this was the giant-scale air-conditioning, brainchild of Qatar’s famous “Dr Cool”, whose indirect carbon footprint must be one of the most terrifyingly vast on earth. Hopefully Dr Cool also recycles and rides a bike. But we all pay for this in the end. Otherwise this was also a World Cup of illusion and fakery, football in the age of populism and post-truth. Concerns about a lack of care by the hosts have been routinely dismissed with useful, dead-end moral relativism; even described, absurdly, as racism (reality: few things are as racist as a structurally racist state carelessly harming migrant workers). Fifa introduced the idea of “unnatural lost time” at this World Cup and Qatar 2022 has often felt like this, from the artful fakery of Stadium 974, which pretended to be an ecological triumph, to the strange dance of the conscience-laundering armbands, presumably long since burnt on the Al-Wakrah docks like the 1970 squad’s van full of corned beef; to the malleable quality of Infantino who believes in revisiting European oppression from 3,000 years ago, but maintains he can’t be held responsible for what happened at Fifa five years before he became president. Feeling dizzy yet? And this is the final thing worth saying about Qatar 2022, which in the end is simply a mirror to the world. Qatar is not an aberration. Qatar is the way the world works, presented to you with brutal, unapologetic clarity. Other nations may have checks and balances, trades unions, democracy, free speech, ways of mitigating the brutality of rule by an overclass. Doha may also have wilfully neglected its duty of care to migrant workers, explicitly targeting nations suffering most from climate change to build its World Cup, because desperate people are cheap people. This does not have to happen. But in the end the real question about migrant workers is why are migrant workers so poor they are willing to do this, and who benefits from that world? Qatar 2022 may be a bloodstained thing but it is also a light and a lens, a crib-sheet on how the world works. Not to mention its superheated carbon centre. Qatar is the power source. Qatar is the winner: this was not an aberration, but a prophecy. A final note on what might happen next, beyond the US, Mexico and Canada in 2026 and our newly opened book on the morality of World Cup hosts. It was interesting that Michel Platini declined Emmanuel Macron’s invitation to attend the World Cup final. Platini is said to be unwilling to meet Infantino and his circle, whom he sees as malevolent architects of his own downfall. There is genuine enmity here. Platini is also free now of criminal charges. Infantino, newly re-elected, cosying up to world leaders, looks bulletproof. But if anyone knows anything about the things no one knows about, it is perhaps Platini, who doesn’t seem to be done just yet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"fashion/2023/jan/20/cate-blanchett-tar-costumes-power-chic-crescendo","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-20T13:00:38Z","webTitle":"Piano forte: Cate Blanchett’s Tár costumes set power chic crescendo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jan/20/cate-blanchett-tar-costumes-power-chic-crescendo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2023/jan/20/cate-blanchett-tar-costumes-power-chic-crescendo","fields":{"bodyText":"It’s the zeitgeist film that has split opinion. Critically adored, awards contender and praised by Martin Scorsese. On the other hand, slated by the prominent conductor Marin Alsop for being “anti-women” and scoffed at as patronising by younger audiences for belittling cancel culture. But there’s one area in which everybody agrees that Tár, Todd Field’s epic about the reputational downfall of a fictional maestro, excels: the clothes. Lydia Tár (Cate Blanchett) embodies the power-lesbian ideal. Crisp, pale blue button-downs. A cashmere sweater slung over her shoulders when curled up in her gigantic, book-lined brutalist apartment. She marches down the streets of Charlottenburg in a luxe, virgin wool coat with padded shoulders, a silk shirt underneath. Clean lines and sharp silhouettes dominate. It’s the kind of aspirational wardrobe that has made people of all genders swoon – and generated fashion world approval. It was not a reaction that costumer designer, Bina Daigeler – who has worked with Blanchett before on the TV series Mrs America – expected. Usually, her aim is that “nobody should notice the clothes, although they are part of the language of the film … it was a big surprise to me”. But Daigeler knew from her first read of Field’s script that Tár’s sartorial choices were – as with all of us, but perhaps especially in Tár’s case with her self-mythologising – key to her character. Daigeler approached the task with the same level of research as she would a period film. The main theme was clear: power dressing. “I think we all do this – when we need to project strength, we dress in a certain way. [Lydia] Tár is a lot about power and strength.” In response to Alsop’s criticism, Blanchett has said Tár was “not a film about gender but about power”; but her silhouette is often a masculine one. Tár is a wealthy woman. Daigeler mentions Margaret Howell, Max Mara and Dries van Noten, among other high-end labels featured. Studio Nicholson and Lemaire supplied many of the staple pieces. The film’s budget was just $35m, which sometimes proved challenging, with Blanchett at one point joking that they had spent most of it on the Diana coat from The Row (which retails at around £3,000). Tár carries the iconic Hermes Birkin (from £7,000), and, for a woman who talks of controlling time, wears a Rolex (approximately £4,000) with the face turned inwards. Daigeler created an entire wardrobe for Tár, as though she were a real person. Some things were specified by Field in the script – Tár’s baseball cap when travelling incognito. Others were Blanchett’s ideas during fittings: the shirts worn over turtlenecks, for instance, a styling trick seen also at the recent Brioni presentation, one of the most luxe brands in the world. As well as haute designers, Daigeler brought in vintage blouses from stores in Berlin and New York, and a lot of custom pieces: “It was a complete mixture”. Tones were mostly muted to reflect Tár’s severe nature and to “match the grey Berlin skies”. It is also about lifestyle – there is little chance for Tár’s beige and pastel Oxford shirts and knitwear to pick up dirt when doing the school run in her electric Porsche and flying first class. Most important to perfect was Tár’s high-collared penguin tuxedo when conducting. They looked to the Austrian maestro Herbert von Karajan, and mostly other past male conductors, for inspiration. “I realised also when I watched Cate in rehearsal [conducting], that it was very important for her to be able to move. But also to have strength in the core. So I made these high-waisted pants to support her,” says Daigeler. There is an extended scene in which Tár visits the tailors and is measured up. As Tár’s world unravels, her put-together look becomes somewhat less put together. Tár is never going to wear jogging bottoms, Daigeler points out, but the outfits become looser, the collars less pressed. The sweaters hang untucked (all in the film are Margaret Howell, which cost about £300). Even trainers and a leather jacket make an appearance. It is about as shabby as the assiduous Tár allows. Given how nice the clothes are, I ask Daigeler if she took any pieces home. She didn’t. For her, “once a job is done it’s done” – but Blanchett did. “There was a very nice Dries van Noten suit which I have seen her in a few times since.” Is there anything accessible for Tár fans who might not have quite the income of a globally famous cultural icon? Try the New York Rangers baseball cap. Yours for £16.50. • This article was amended on 23 January 2023. Tár drives an electric Porsche in the film, not a Tesla."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2022/nov/26/england-south-africa-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-26T19:59:12Z","webTitle":"South Africa’s power game condemns England and Jones to another defeat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/26/england-south-africa-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/nov/26/england-south-africa-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-match-report","fields":{"bodyText":"No great escape this time, just cold hard reality. England have no divine right to beat the world champions every time they face them in London but as this contest drifted to its inevitable conclusion there were distinct echoes of the 2019 Rugby World Cup final in Yokohama. England were not good enough then and they were similarly outplayed here. South Africa, at the end of a tough old year, fully deserved their first victory over England on this ground since 2014. Their forwards were as flinty as ever but their game-splitting try was a beauty, starting life in the visitors’ own 22 and ending with wing Kurt-Lee Arendse diving into the right corner some 80 metres away. The Springboks have been looking to expand their horizons slightly and here was further proof they have the players to do so. But whither England? Their autumn has been a curious mix of elation and exasperation but it has concluded with boos from the stands and many of the same old questions unanswered. Their calendar year return for 2022 also now makes for pretty uncomfortable reading. P12 W5 D1 L6 is statistically their worst return since 2008. The theory is that England should be judged purely on the World Cup and everything else is mere froth on the pricy Twickenham cappuccino. Which is fine if they go on and lift the Webb Ellis Cup next year. But, for whatever reason, this is a team that only seems to start playing when it has absolutely nothing to lose. Without the 60th-minute red card shown to South Africa’s Thomas du Toit, the final scoreline might have been even more lop-sided. Considering South Africa have also been beaten by both Ireland and France in recent weeks, it leaves Eddie Jones with much to ponder. If the idea is to blast past South Africa’s ‘Bomb Squad’ in the second half, the starters need to give them some kind of platform. A penny, too, for the thoughts of Rassie Erasmus, banned from matchday duties for his social media posts about referees. How he would have loved to have been on the field at the end, lapping up a result that will sooth a lot of green and gold angst. In terms of power and dynamism England’s pack finished a distant second even after Du Toit’s departure and, as a direct result, there was little cohesion behind the scrum either. From the moment Freddie Steward dropped a routine early high ball and his captain Owen Farrell tugged two of his first three penalties wide it felt like a hard day’s night from a home perspective. The Springboks were significantly more alert from early on. A smart variation to the front of the lineout almost yielded a try for Siya Kolisi only for the visiting skipper to be held up over the line, and England were soon spending an ominous amount of time in their own half. Manu Tuilagi, on his 50th England appearance, had a couple of early rumbles but was otherwise mostly a spectator. Tactically the Boks were also spot on. Midfield space was so scarce initially that it made complete sense for the quietly impressive Damian Willemse to slip back into the pocket and drop a goal to make it 6-3. England, by contrast, stuck to a playbook that was bearing little fruit. Marcus Smith kept launching predictable high balls and, with just over half an hour gone, the Springboks burst into counterattacking life. Willemse nipped away from Steward, linked nicely with Faf de Klerk and Willie le Roux and the nippy Arendse scooted away for his seventh try in as many Tests. Twickenham, the only disco in the world where drum and bass interchanges with Jerusalem, fell quiet. When De Klerk chipped over another penalty to make it 14-3 just before the interval it also left England with another second half mountain to climb. To be well behind at half-time to strong southern hemisphere opposition is unfortunate. To do so twice in eight days, as Oscar Wilde might have concluded, felt like carelessness. Inside two minutes of the restart England’s task became even harder courtesy of Willemse’s second drop goal, this time from 40 metres. It revived memories of Jannie de Beer’s fusillade of drop goals in the quarter-finals of the 1999 World Cup and prompted a midfield dust up between the increasingly upbeat South African forwards and their frustrated opposite numbers. By now things were threatening to unravel completely for the reshuffled hosts. With Tom Curry in the sin bin, the giant Eben Etzebeth crashed over for his side’s second try and De Klerk’s conversion and subsequent penalty made it 27-6. Despite Henry Slade’s 72nd minute consolation score there was to be no All Black-style resurrection. So add up England’s November efforts and what do you have? The angst against Argentina, the jaunt against Japan, the near miss against New Zealand and now this blitz to the Boks. Nine months remain until next year’s World Cup but the English public are not currently expecting much. Jones has rotated his starting XV to little obvious effect and other nations have England’s number. For a team with lofty ambitions in 2023, a solitary win over a below-par Japan from four autumn Tests is simply not good enough."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/20/ukraine-plans-power-cuts-after-russian-strikes-on-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-20T18:16:40Z","webTitle":"Ukraine plans power cuts after Russian strikes on plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/20/ukraine-plans-power-cuts-after-russian-strikes-on-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/20/ukraine-plans-power-cuts-after-russian-strikes-on-plants","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine has introduced an emergency schedule of power cuts to help stabilise the country’s energy supply, which has been badly damaged by more than 300 Russian drone and missile attacks over the past 10 days as the weather turns cooler. The country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said people needed to be “especially conscious of electricity consumption” from 7am and avoid using unnecessary appliances as he warned of local “stabilisation blackouts”. Three energy facilities were destroyed by Russia on Wednesday, the president said, with a further strike reported in the region of the southern city of Kryvyi Rih overnight amid growing official alarm over the impact of the Russian campaign. In video remarks to an EU summit on Thursday, Zelenskiy said Russia hoped to provoke a new wave of migration to European countries. “Russian terror against our energy facilities is aimed at creating as many problems with electricity and heat as possible for Ukraine this autumn and winter, so that more Ukrainians go to European countries,” he said. In response, he said, allied nations should provide more anti-aircraft systems and impose additional sanctions on Iran, which produces some of the drones Moscow is using. Kyiv and other parts of the country had enjoyed an unseasonably warm spell in mid-October, but on Thursday the weather was markedly cooler. The capital’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, announced the start of the “heating season”, where municipal boilers are turned on to heat apartment blocks. Earlier this week the president said 30% of Ukraine’s power plants had been destroyed in eight days, prompting pleas from the country for air defence systems from the west, which appeared to have been caught by surprise. There have been more than 300 strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities since 10 October, when the Russian campaign started, said Herman Halushchenko, Ukraine’s energy minister. To help cope, the government was seeking a 20% reduction in energy use. Some strikes have caused relatively minor damage, which engineers have been able to repair, but government insiders have acknowledged the destruction of some facilities is significant and could take more than a year to repair. A Russian airstrike hit a major thermal power station in the city of Burshtyn, in western Ukraine, on Wednesday. It caused “quite serious” damage, the governor of the Ivano-Frankivsk region, Svitlana Onyshchuk, said on Ukrainian television. Ukraine’s electricity transmission company, Ukrenergo, warned local blackouts of up to four hours may take place around the country at times between 7am and 10pm, because the energy system had suffered an “attack of the enemy greater than in eight months of war”. The public were told to charge phones and other batteries overnight, while street lighting would be limited in cities. All regions of the country would be affected, said Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the presidential office. The whole north-east region of Sumy, which borders Russia, said it would go the entire day without electric transport, street lighting and water, from 7am to 11pm. A wave of drone strikes hit Kyiv on Monday morning in the district around the airport, killing five when a residential building was hit, but on Wednesday further attacks aimed at the capital were successfully intercepted. The president said 10 Iranian-made drones were destroyed in the Kyiv area that day – and a total of 233 had been shot down during all of October, although the figures cannot be independently verified. The relatively cheap drones are frequently inaccurate, causing civilian casualties, as they explode near power plants around the country. Iran denies supplying the drones to Russia, while Moscow has claimed the Shahed-136 drones, rebranded as Geran-2, are made locally. But experts say there is little doubt about the origin of the drones, which have a distinctive delta wing shape – and that position was boosted by a slip on Russian television. Ruslan Pukhov, from the Moscow-based thinktank Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, asked journalists before a television interview not to question him on the origin of the drones, unaware that he was live on air. “We all know that they are Iranian-made, but authorities haven’t acknowledged that,” he said. The German chancellor said Russia was using energy and hunger as weapons. “Scorched earth tactics will not help Russia win the war. They will only strengthen the unity and resolve of Ukraine and its partners,” Olaf Scholz told the German parliament. But the former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said Scholz had forgotten the lessons of history, referring to the second world war: “The German chancellor has clearly forgotten the Nazi past of his country and the 30 million Soviet people who were killed or died of hunger and cold during the war.” British intelligence said comments made by Russia’s principal commander, Gen Sergei Surovikin, on Tuesday that “a difficult situation has emerged” in the Kherson area meant it was likely the Kremlin was “seriously considering a major withdrawal of their forces” from west of the Dnieper River. Their position “looks shaky”, Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, later told MPs. Ukrainian troops are trying to advance on the city and are believed to be making progress, although their efforts are shrouded in operational secrecy. Oleksiy Hromov, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian general staff, said Russia may leave only newly conscripted troops west of the river as it tries to evacuate up to 20,000 more-experienced soldiers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/04/ilya-yashin-kremlin-critic-speaks-out-from-russian-prison-putin-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-04T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"‘Putin has gone mad from power’: Kremlin critic Ilya Yashin speaks out from Russian prison","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/04/ilya-yashin-kremlin-critic-speaks-out-from-russian-prison-putin-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/04/ilya-yashin-kremlin-critic-speaks-out-from-russian-prison-putin-ukraine","fields":{"bodyText":"Writing from a cell in a Russian jail known as the Bear, Ilya Yashin remained as defiant as ever. In neat, blue-ink lettering, the opposition politician was able to express himself candidly despite his incarceration. Removing Vladimir Putin from power, he wrote, was a prerequisite to “avoiding the risks of a new world war”. “As long as Putin retains power, war, or at least the threat of war, will be permanent,” Yashin said in written answers to questions from the Guardian, delivered by his lawyers this week. “This man has gone mad from unlimited power and impunity, he has become a slave to his maniacal ambitions.” Yashin was sentenced last year to eight and a half years in prison for a broadcast on his popular YouTube channel in which he accused the Russian army of a massacre of civilians in Bucha. It may take regime change before Yashin, 39, tastes freedom again. Some Russians have taken to coining the jail terms handed down to activists and dissidents as PPZh, an acronym for “while Putin is alive”. In Yashin’s case, he admits that his release date is “difficult to predict”. “Obviously, I will have a chance to get out of prison if the government changes in Russia,” he said. But this is “not a question of today or tomorrow. It is clear that Putin’s goodwill cannot be counted on. He hates people who have publicly opposed military aggression in Ukraine and considers them enemies.” Long before Yashin’s arrest last summer, he knew he was in danger. Police had told a girlfriend he was a “step away from prison”, while a lawyer had told him bluntly that “if I did not leave Russia in the coming days, I would end up behind bars”, he said. Friends and family spoke to him about emigrating. “But none of my family manipulated me with a feeling of guilt and urged me to run away,” he said. “And I am very grateful for that.” Yashin appears at peace with his decision to follow the arduous path of a modern Russian dissident. A veteran of the protest scene that turned out on Bolotnaya Square alongside Alexei Navalny and Boris Nemtsov in 2011, he has evolved from a whiz-kid of the Russian opposition to something like its grizzled wartime conscience. And he seems hellbent – through his own example now – to prove there is a solid bedrock of Russians who oppose the war against Ukraine. “Why did I refuse to emigrate?” he wrote. “Because from the first day of the fighting, I understood that an anti-war voice should be speaking in Russia. It should speak as loudly as possible under the circumstances. Putin has done everything to silence the opponents of the attack on Ukraine. He intimidated Russians, he established military censorship, forced his critics abroad under threat of arrest. The Kremlin did its best to create the illusion of mass, total support for military aggression in Russian society. And I live here and I know that there is no total support, that many are against the war.” It is a thesis to which Yashin will return as he descends deeper into Russia’s vast network of holding cells, jails and prisons. He has already been moved five times in the past eight months, including a trip to Udmurtia, more than 600 miles from Moscow. In the Bear, his fellow prisoners include generals, deputy ministers, wealthy businessmen and a few political prisoners. But his cellmates were all arrested on drug charges. “Strangely enough, I very rarely meet sincere supporters of the war and Putin’s aggressive policy behind bars,” he wrote. “People here don’t really trust the Russian state at all, have faced injustice and are offended by the authorities.” Those imprisoned for “economic” crimes are more likely to be vocal opponents of the war, he wrote, including businessmen, lawyers and other professionals. “The rhetoric of such prisoners is usually very radical: they have seen the system from the inside, know how rotten and corroded it is by corruption, consider themselves victims of this system.” But there are others ready to go to fight despite rumours, Yashin said, of overwhelming losses and outrage that prisoners are being used as cannon fodder. As a rule, he said, they are either the very poor or the very desperate, those who have been given long prison terms for serious crimes and see war as “their only chance to gain freedom”. On a prison train to Udmurtia, he said, he met a 48-year-old man serving a 20-year sentence for murder and robberies. He compared his decision to enlist as a mercenary to playing Russian roulette. “The stake in this game is life and freedom,” he said. “Moreover, with whom to fight and whom to kill, it does not matter to him … It’s like an animal instinct: just to break out of the cage, just to survive, just to get the sentence overturned.” What were sometimes called the “vegetarian” years of Putin’s rule, the days before political assassinations, mass crackdowns and full-scale invasions, are over. Russia’s democratic opposition is deep in the weeds. Navalny, its most prominent figure, was nearly poisoned to death and has been sentenced to more than a decade in prison. Yashin, for his part, suggested that with “empty hands” Russia’s opposition would be powerless to enact change from within. “There will be no opposition under Putin’s regime,” he wrote. “For the formation of a normal democratic system, its dismantling is required.” Asked what the west could do to help, he said he thought it could “send a clear signal to the Russian people that it does not consider them an enemy”. Russians needed an alternative to Putin’s imperialism, which brought death and poverty, isolation, corruption, arbitrariness, he added. “It would be a big mistake if the rhetoric and sanctions policy of the west degenerate into Russophobia.” Remarks like these have put Yashin at odds with some of Ukraine’s most ardent supporters abroad. They have said millions of Russians are to blame just as much as Putin for the war. Yashin has always argued the opposite, that “our society has also become a victim of Putin”. “Don’t get me wrong, I don’t idealise my people,” he wrote. “Yes, unfortunately we have allowed this criminal power into the Kremlin. People believed the propaganda, allowed themselves to be manipulated, did not control officials and security forces. All this is our responsibility. But this does not mean that the Russian people deserve to be defamed.” In prison, Yashin said, he devotes his time to reading, answering letters from supporters and journalists, and recording his observations for a book. He makes small sketches that “are not very skilled from an artistic point of view but reflect the atmosphere of Russian captivity”. Yashin has called the killing of Nemtsov in 2015 one of the two worst nights of his life. The other was Putin’s announcement of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Asked whether he thought his own life was at risk, he replied: “It is difficult to talk about this topic. After Nemtsov’s shooting at the Kremlin walls, Navalny’s poisoning, mass killings in Ukraine, you can expect anything from this government. “But, to be honest, I try not to think about it. Just to keep from going crazy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/08/ukraine-nuclear-plant-attack-suicidal-un-chief-zaporizhzhia-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-08T16:32:00Z","webTitle":"Attack on Ukraine nuclear plant ‘suicidal’, says UN chief as he urges access to site","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/08/ukraine-nuclear-plant-attack-suicidal-un-chief-zaporizhzhia-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/08/ukraine-nuclear-plant-attack-suicidal-un-chief-zaporizhzhia-russia","fields":{"bodyText":"The UN secretary general has called for international inspectors to be given access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant after Ukraine and Russia traded accusations over the shelling of Europe’s largest atomic plant at the weekend. “Any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,” António Guterres told a news conference in Japan on Monday, two days after attending the Hiroshima peace memorial ceremony to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the world’s first atomic bombing. Guterres said the International Atomic Energy Agency needed access to the plant. “We fully support the IAEA in all their efforts in relation to create the conditions of stabilisation of the plant,” he said. Ukraine said renewed Russian shelling on Saturday had damaged three radiation sensors and hurt a worker at the Zaporizhzhia power plant, the second hit in consecutive days on the site. Ukraine’s ambassador to the IAEA, Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk, echoed the call for international inspectors and said Russian forces were attempting to cause electricity blackouts in southern Ukraine by shelling the plant, which was captured by Russian forces in early March but is still run by Ukrainian technicians. He said Zaporizhzhia staff were “working under the barrels of Russian guns”. Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom, said the creation of a demilitarised zone around the site and the presence of peacekeepers “would resolve this problem”. He warned of the danger of shells hitting containers of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel. If two or more containers were to be broken, “it is impossible to assess the scale” of the resulting disaster. “Such insane actions could leave to the situation spiralling out of control and it will be a Fukushima or Chornobyl,” Kotin said. In a televised address on Sunday the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russia of waging “nuclear terror” that warranted more international sanctions, this time on Moscow’s nuclear sector. “There is no such nation in the world that could feel safe when a terrorist state fires at a nuclear plant,” Zelenskiy said. Russian-installed authorities in the area said Ukrainian forces hit the site with a multiple rocket launcher, damaging administrative buildings and an area near a storage facility. The Russian embassy in Washington also released a statement itemising the damage. “Ukrainian nationalists launched an artillery strike on the territory of the specified object on 5 August. Two high-voltage power lines and a water pipeline were damaged as a result of the shelling. Only thanks to the effective and timely actions of the Russian military in covering the nuclear power facility, its critical infrastructure was not affected,” the embassy said. The head of Zaporizhzhia’s occupying authorities, Evgeniy Balitskyi, said Ukrainian forces were to blame and had “decided to put the whole of Europe on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe” by shelling the plant. Ukraine says Russia has turned the plant into a military base, making it extremely hard to target the Russian troops and equipment inside. According to the New York Times, Russia has been using the plant as cover from which to fire on Ukrainian forces since mid-July. The Washington-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessed on 3 August that Russian forces were likely to be using the power plant to “play on western fears of a nuclear disaster in Ukraine in an effort to degrade western will to provide military support to a Ukrainian counteroffensive”. The ISW further said that Russia was “effectively using the plant as a nuclear shield to prevent Ukrainian strikes on Russian forces and equipment”. It has not been possible to independently determine which side was responsible for the attack on the power station. The IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, warned on Saturday that the latest attack “underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. In other developments on Monday: The Russian-installed leader of the Zaporizhzhia region signed a decree allowing for a referendum on joining Russia to take place. The Russian state news agency Ria Novosti reported that the declaration was signed at a conference of 700 regional officials where all present unanimously raised their hands in support of the referendum. In his video address on Sunday night Zelenskiy warned about “pseudo referendums” in the occupied south of Ukraine. He told Russia that choosing that path would close down “any possibility of negotiations with Ukraine and the free world”. Ukrainian forces again shelled Antonivskyi Bridge in the Russian-controlled city of Kherson, damaging construction equipment and delaying its reopening, Interfax news agency quoted a local Russian-appointed official as saying. Two more ships, carrying corn and soya beans, departed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports, Turkey and Ukraine said, taking the total to 10 since the first ship sailed last week under a deal with Russia to unblock Ukrainian grain exports. The United Nations and Turkey brokered the agreement last month after warnings the halt in grain shipments caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could lead to severe food shortages and even outbreaks of famine in parts of the world. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said if Russia were allowed to bully Ukraine, invade and take its territory, “then it’s going to be open season, not just in Europe but around the world”. One of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies has claimed the west wants to destroy Russia. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president, who is now the virulently anti-western deputy head of the country’s security council, was speaking to the news agency Tass on the 14th anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Georgia. He linked the wars in Georgia and Ukraine as “one conspiracy aimed against Russia”.

Speaking on a visit to Washington, Rau said the alliance was in the process of delivering that message to Moscow. The Russian military debacle in Ukraine, where its forces are being pushed back in the east of the country, has increased concerns that a desperate Vladimir Putin could resort to using a nuclear weapon, possibly a lower-yield tactical warhead, in a bid to shock Ukraine into halting its resistance to his invasion. “To the best of our knowledge, Putin is threatening to use tactical nuclear weapons on Ukrainian soil, not to attack Nato, which means that Nato should respond in a conventional way,” Rau told the NBC News program Meet the Press NOW. “But the response should be devastating. And I suppose this is the clear message that the Nato alliance is sending to Russia right now.” The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, warned on Sunday that any nuclear use by the Kremlin would have “catastrophic consequences for Russia”, which had been “spelled out” in private conversations with Russian officials. The Russian military has expanded conscription with the official aim of sending 300,000 more soldiers into Ukraine, though there are reports the real goal is considerably more. The mobilisation has triggered unrest and an exodus across Russia’s borders, particularly of draft-age men. “Obviously, President Putin is losing the war in Ukraine,” Rau said. “So his reaction to it is to launch mobilisation. But the mobilisation doesn’t seem to help him win the war.” The Polish foreign minister said Ukraine’s armed forces had already defeated Russia’s professional soldiers, so the new conscripts who were “poorly trained and poorly equipped” were unlikely to change the course of the war. Rau said that if the mobilisation did lead to a breakthrough, it would be in Russian public opinion. “So far, the war was popular, at least for the majority of the Russian population, up to 80%,” he said. “And now, every Russian family will have to take their own position towards the war, knowing that their loved ones can be sent there and they can be killed there.” During his trip to Washington, Rau is not meeting any members of the Biden administration, but will see congressional leaders, Sullivan’s predecessor as national security adviser, John Bolton, and will visit a new museum in the US capital dedicated to the victims of communism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/05/georgia-brian-kemp-bill-remove-local-prosecutors","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-05T21:16:43Z","webTitle":"Georgia governor signs bill that allows removal of district attorneys ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/05/georgia-brian-kemp-bill-remove-local-prosecutors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/05/georgia-brian-kemp-bill-remove-local-prosecutors","fields":{"bodyText":"Georgia’s governor, Brian Kemp, signed a bill on Friday that makes it possible to oust elected district attorneys from office if they are believed to not be adequately enforcing the law. It’s a move that is seen a thinly veiled power grab to push out Democratic prosecutors, include some who said they would not prosecute abortion-related crimes. The new law sets up a statewide Prosecuting Attorneys Statewide Qualifications Commission with the power to investigate complaints against district attorneys and remove them if they have sufficient cause. The law outlines a series of offenses for which a prosecutor can be removed, including “willful and persistent failure” to carry out their duties and categorically refusing to prosecute crimes they are required by law to pursue. “I am not gonna stand idly by as rogue or incompetent prosecutors refuse to uphold the law,” Kemp said at an event before he signed the bill on Friday in Savannah. “Today we are sending a message that we will not forfeit public safety for prosecutors who let criminals off the hook.” The measure comes as Fani Willis, a Democrat serving as the Fulton county district attorney, investigates Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. A special purpose grand jury has already recommended indictments in the matter and Willis has said if there are charges, they would be announced this summer. Willis has criticized the measure as “racist”, noting earlier this year that Republicans were pushing the measure after the number of minority district attorneys increased from five to 14 in 2020. ““I’m tired and I’m just going to call it how I see it,” she said. “I, quite frankly, think the legislation is racist. I don’t know what other thing to call it,” she told a senate panel earlier this year, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The eight-person commission will consist of a five-member committee that can investigate district attorneys and a three-member hearing panel. The commissioners’ terms will formally begin in July 2024, the same month complaints can start to be filed. The commission’s members would be appointed by the governor, lieutenant governor and legislature in Georgia, which are all Republican-led. The new law is widely believed to target Deborah Gonzalez, a Democrat who was elected the prosecutor in Athens-Clarke and Oconee counties in 2020. Gonzalez has adopted a number of criminal justice reforms, including not charging for simple possession of marijuana. She was also one of several district attorneys in Georgia who announced last year that she would not prosecute abortion-related crimes. “This is not an oversight bill. It’s an overstep on the part of the legislature to undermine the voice and vote of the people who elected us as DAs based on our approach and what they felt they wanted, in terms of the way that justice should be done in their community. This just takes all of that away,” Gonzalez told Bolts, an online newsmagazine. Houston Gaines, a state lawmaker from Athens who supports the bill, said the point of it “is to restore public safety in places where you have rogue district attorneys who simply are not doing their job”, according to the Associated Press. The bill comes as Republicans elsewhere have moved to remove elected progressive prosecutors from office. In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis suspended Andrew Warren, a Democrat, after Warren said he would not enforce crimes around abortion and gender therapy. In St. Louis, Republicans were moving to oust Kim Gardner, the circuit attorney for St Louis county, before she announced she was resigning on Thursday. Georgia lawmakers also previously passed a measure that allowed for a takeover of local election boards for poor performance. A panel reviewing the elections operations in Fulton county, the most populous in the state, recommended not taking over the board earlier this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/dec/05/hakeem-jeffries-rise-to-power-change-him","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-05T10:00:39Z","webTitle":"Will the ‘cool, calm, collected’ Hakeem Jeffries change when in power?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/05/hakeem-jeffries-rise-to-power-change-him","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/dec/05/hakeem-jeffries-rise-to-power-change-him","fields":{"bodyText":"Democratic congressman Hakeem Jeffries first emerged in the mid-2000s as a former corporate lawyer homegrown from central Brooklyn. With his focus on criminal justice reform and housing affordability, he was seen as a progressive of the moment who took on the existing Democratic machine in New York. Now, as the newly elected successor to House speaker Nancy Pelosi, Jeffries has graduated from state politics to the national stage with the opportunity to make an impression on American politics for years to come. Last week Jeffries, 52, became the first Black leader of either party in Congress. Under the incoming Congress, Jeffries will be House minority leader, making him the most powerful Democrat in the House. His ascension, paired with the departures of longtime and elderly Democratic leaders like Pelosi, Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn, signals a shift for Democrats toward a younger, more diverse generation of leaders that will undoubtedly face tension with a new Republican House majority on the horizon. But will Jeffries change? Some political historians argue that Jeffries’ rise fits into a pattern of Black lawmakers who, as they climb the party leadership ranks, become more moderate, raising questions as to how Jeffries will navigate the post differently from his predecessor, Nancy Pelosi. Katherine Tate, a political science professor at Brown University and author of several books including Concordance: Black Lawmaking in the US Congress from Carter to Obama, said it was “wise to elevate younger members right now” to energize young voters but questioned whether Jeffries would accomplish anything “radical or significant off the bat”. She noted that Jeffries will have to navigate competing ideologies not just within his own party, but with a seriously fractured Republican party controlling the House in the next Congress. Faced with his own party’s divisions – including a highly visible progressive wing influenced by fellow New Yorker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her “Squad” – and the chaos of the Republican party’s emboldened extremists, the next two years are likely to be messy. Jeffries “is not going to have his own agenda. He’s going to shepherd other people’s agendas through”, Tate said. Congressman Ritchie Torres, who represents the south Bronx, told the Guardian that Jeffries’ rise reflected the strength of his ability to work as an insider and outsider. He described the fellow New York Democrat as “highly cerebral” and “cool, calm, and collected” – capable of talking about the intricacies of policy while quoting Biggie Smalls during former president Donald Trump’s impeachment proceedings. Torres expected, under Jeffries’ leadership, the Democratic party would be more committed to issues of racial equity, ensuring people of color a seat at the table, even as Jeffries manages and responds to the ideological forces within his party. Jennifer Garcia, an assistant professor of politics at Oberlin College, agreed, noting that Jeffries’ platform can be an empowering force for not just lawmakers of color but also voters. “Racial identity does matter and because of that, he will behave in a distinct way than past speakers,” said Garcia, who is writing a book on how Black Congress members use legislation to advance policy priorities for Black Americans. Torres said Jeffries is also “willing to reach across the aisle in the service of progressive change”, pointing to his colleague’s efforts in negotiating the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which passed in the House but failed to make movement in the Senate. “He knows how to build coalition and consensus over the caucus, and he’s the best communicator in the House Democratic caucus,” he said. Analysis by Voteview, a database of congressional votes from the University of California, Los Angeles’ political science department, shows that Jeffries, a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and of the Congressional Black Caucus, has a more moderate voting record than some older, more liberal Black legislators such as congresswomen Barbara Lee and Maxine Waters. Still, according to Voteview, his voting record remains more liberal than 85% of the Democratic party. Torres resisted any idea that Black lawmakers become more moderate as they rose in the ranks, pointing to Black leaders like Elijah Cummings, John Lewis and Jim Clyburn, who is expected to let go of his long-held position as the number three Democrat. “These people are not only progressive but they are also effective at advancing progressive agenda, which Hakeem has done,” he said, adding: “Neither the new guard nor the old guard are a monolith. The House Democratic caucus is by and large unified around a progressive agenda.” Tate said Jeffries came up at a time when the Democratic party was more open to Black leaders, enabling him to develop the mindset of working across the party and compromising rather than working outside the party. Garcia cautioned that the Voteview numbers were imperfect because they focused on roll call votes on legislation that makes it through hurdles to a vote. “Regardless of race and gender, as you rise in the ranks of party leadership, there’s adapting you have to do to attain that power,” Garcia said. *** Lupe Todd-Medina, a longtime adviser who worked on Jeffries’ campaigns, described Jeffries as a loving parent with a strong work ethic, and also spoke of his ability to work across the aisle. Jeffries, who has been described as “Brooklyn’s Barack Obama”, grew up in Crown Heights, now a rapidly changing neighborhood in Brooklyn, at the height of the crack cocaine epidemic and escalating crime in New York City. One of the few Black attorneys at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Jeffries was part of a class of eventual Black power brokers in the mid-2000s – alongside New York attorney general Letitia James, state senator Kevin Parker, and now Mayor Eric Adams – who were then considered young progressives out of central Brooklyn. “Those guys were not waiting for their turn,” Todd-Medina said. “It brought a liveliness and rebirth to local politics.” As a member of the New York state assembly, Jeffries worked with then-state senator Eric Adams to pass legislation to force the New York police department to stop adding the names of everyone who was stopped and frisked to a database used in criminal investigations. In 2018, six years after he was elected to Congress, Jeffries, despite opposition from fellow Democrats, worked with the Trump administration to write and pass the First Step Act, a federal prison reform bill. “He’s pragmatic. There’s nothing wrong with being pragmatic. There’s no purity test in being that,” Medina said. “You have to be realistic and work across the aisle and he’s always been one to know how to maneuver that well.” When Black lawmakers first entered a segregated Congress in the 1950s, their policy priorities were ignored by the Democratic establishment, Garcia and Tate said. Adam Clayton Powell Jr, a Black pastor who represented Harlem in the House from 1945 to 1971, was outspoken about how the Democratic establishment silenced him. He would introduce what was known as the Powell amendment to legislation to effectively stop federal funding toward initiatives that perpetuated segregation, Garcia said. “The Democratic party of the time won’t take up his agenda item. He continues to add it to everything he can. He can’t go through the traditional structure, he had to be a disruptor. People got pissed at him,” Garcia said. “They had to agitate to make themselves the force to be listened to or else they were easily ignored.” During the Reagan era, as more Black lawmakers ascended to political power, they were concerned Democrats were moving “too far to the right”. During the Clinton administration in the mid-1990s, when Republicans took control of the House, “this put pressure on Blacks to be more unified for the party,” Tate said. Today’s Democratic party is more liberal and diverse than before, and Jeffries’ ascension to House leader, along with Massachusetts congresswoman Katherine Clark and California congressman Pete Aguilar, reflected a significant generational shift in leadership ahead of a Republican-controlled House for women and people of color. “We will have to collaborate with Republicans to pass legislation for the good of the country and at the same time, we have to resist the worst of the Republican congress. There’s no contradiction to the two goals,” Torres said. “We will collaborate with Republicans when it benefits the country and we will resist Republicans when Republicans seek to do harm to the country.” In this atmosphere, Garcia said Jeffries’ impending leadership is “clearly a positive step and important symbolically to empower Black and brown communities”, adding: “I’m optimistic that there’s something about him that will take the responsibilities differently than past legislators.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/08/canada-aukus-defence-pact","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-08T18:16:17Z","webTitle":"Canada hopes to join Aukus defence pact, says report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/08/canada-aukus-defence-pact","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/08/canada-aukus-defence-pact","fields":{"bodyText":"Canada’s defence minister has said the country is “highly interested” working closer on defence technology with Australia, Britain and the US, after reports that the country wants to join the Aukus defence pact. The Globe and Mail reported on Monday that Canada was making efforts to join the group, amid fears that the country could be excluded from valuable intelligence and technology sharing between a smaller circle of nations. Both the foreign affairs ministry and Privy Council are working to have Canada included, the Globe reported. Asked whether Canada had made a formal application to join the deal, defence minister, Anita Anand, told reporters: “Canada is highly interested in furthering cooperation on AI, quantum computing and other advanced technologies with a defence nexus with our closest allies.” Anand said: “Our ties with our Five Eyes allies are strong, and indeed we remain interested in furthering cooperation in AI and other innovation efforts with our allies.” The Aukus agreement was seen as an effort by the three signatory nations to build up a greater presence in the Indo-Pacific region, and included an agreement to supply nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. At the time, officials in Ottawa downplayed the deal’s relevance to Canada. “This is a deal for nuclear submarines, which Canada is not currently or any time soon in the market for. Australia is,” Justin Trudeau told reporters at the time. But Canada’s exclusion from the alliance was seen as something of a snub for the country, and the prime minister faced sharp domestic criticism over Canada’s exclusion, with his Conservative rival suggesting the prime minister was “not taken seriously by our friends and allies around the world”. Canada has since announced its own Indo-Pacific strategy, to “promote and defend” its national interests in a region where nations are jockeying for influence and power. Thomas Juneau, an associate professor in the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Ottawa, said: “There was a lot of hand wringing in Canada at the time, as there always is when we’re not part of something. But Canada does not want nuclear submarines. We don’t have the money for nuclear submarines at this point.” Canada already shares intelligence with Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States and New Zealand – an agreement known as the Five Eyes. But in the months since Aukus was formed, a number of working groups have formed to deal with emerging and disruptive technologies, said Juneau, who is working on a paper about the future of Canada’s relations with Aukus with Stephanie Carvin, an associate professor of international relations at Carleton University. Juneau said it was “definitely in Canada’s interest” to try to be in those working groups, though it is unclear how closely they will be tied to the nuclear submarine technology dimension. “The door is not shut for Canada to be involved, but Canada will have to show what it can bring to the table,” he said, adding Canada has emerged as a leader in artificial and signals intelligence. But amid growing criticism that the governing Liberals have neglected defence and intelligence investments, Canada faces stiff competition to gain access to the group as other nations, such as Japan and South Korea, also make a case for inclusion. “We’re not going to be brought into these groups, just because we’re a traditional ally,” said Juneau. “We’re going to be brought into these groups, because we can make the case that we have something to contribute, which in some cases, is a case that we can make.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/feb/27/what-is-the-stormont-brake-restore-power-sharing-northern-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-27T17:19:35Z","webTitle":"What is the Stormont brake and will it help restore power sharing in Northern Ireland?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/27/what-is-the-stormont-brake-restore-power-sharing-northern-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/feb/27/what-is-the-stormont-brake-restore-power-sharing-northern-ireland","fields":{"bodyText":"The most interesting part of the press conference between the UK prime minister and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, was probably what Rishi Sunak said about the deal including a “Stormont brake”, which will allow the Northern Ireland assembly to stop new EU single market rules from applying in the region. He said the agreement “safeguards sovereignty” for Northern Ireland as a result. It had been reported that the agreement – known as the Windsor framework – would give the Northern Ireland assembly a right to be consulted on new single market rules; but this goes further, because the assembly would be able to block new rules applying in Northern Ireland. Sunak said: The only EU law that applies in Northern Ireland under the framework is the minimum necessary to avoid a hard border with Ireland and allow Northern Ireland business to continue accessing the EU market. But I know many people in Northern Ireland are worried about being subject to changes in EU goods law. To address that, today’s agreement introduces a new Stormont brake. Many have called for Stormont to have a say over these laws, but the Stormont brake goes further and means that Stormont can in fact stop them from applying in Northern Ireland. This will establish a clear process for which the democratically elected assembly can pull an emergency brake for changes to EU goods rules that would have significant and lasting effects on everyday lives. If the brake is pulled, the UK government will have a veto. This feature of the deal – assuming Sunak has described it accurately, and that critics do not find a catch when they get to inspect the small print of the deal – will make it hard for the DUP to oppose the deal. That is because, for the brake to apply, power sharing at Stormont would have to be restored. That would require the DUP to allow the assembly to start sitting (by backing the election of a speaker) and to lift its boycott on participating in the power-sharing executive. The DUP has said it will only do this if it gets a deal it finds acceptable. If the DUP were to continue to boycott the executive, the “Stormont brake” would not apply. And the alternative would not be no protocol; it would be Northern Ireland still being in the single market but not having the veto as described by Sunak. Unlike the DUP, Sinn Féin is not ideologically opposed to Northern Ireland being subject to EU laws. Its main political goal is for Irish reunification, which would probably involve Northern Ireland fully rejoining the EU. Sinn Féin has broadly welcomed the deal. Mary Lou McDonald, its president, said: “We are now at a turning point and that is good news for business and wider society. People in the north want and deserve certainty and stability. The economic possibilities the protocol opens up must be seized to benefit people in the north.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/02/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-power-plant-physical-integrity-violated-un-nuclear-chief-says","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-02T20:32:32Z","webTitle":"Physical integrity of Zaporizhzhia plant ‘violated’, says UN nuclear chief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/02/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-power-plant-physical-integrity-violated-un-nuclear-chief-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/02/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-power-plant-physical-integrity-violated-un-nuclear-chief-says","fields":{"bodyText":"The “physical integrity” of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in south-eastern Ukraine has been “violated”, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said, as Ukraine’s authorities accused Russia of misleading the inspection mission. After leading a team of inspectors to the Russian-occupied plant, the biggest nuclear power station in Europe, Rafael Grossi said that two IAEA experts would stay on permanently to provide constant monitoring and an uninterrupted flow of information to IAEA headquarters in Vienna. Grossi hoped the agency’s presence would help “stabilise” the situation there, after recent instances of shelling of the plant. But he said he remained very concerned about safety. “It is obvious that the plant and physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times,” Grossi told reporters. “Irrespective of the kinetic power of whatever you are throwing at the plant, it’s unacceptable under any safety and security criteria.” He said his other two main concerns were the external power supply which had been interrupted recently triggering the emergency diesel generators to switch on to keep cooling and other systems going, and the condition of the staff. Once back in Vienna, Grossi said it was “admirable” that Ukrainian technical staff were continuing to work to keep the plant going (two of the six reactors are still functioning) and maintaining professional relations with their Russian counterparts, but he added: “There is a latent tension there because of the obvious reasons of the war.” Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, Energoatom, had claimed that the IAEA was not shown certain areas of the site, and instead had witnessed a staged “show”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russia of intimidating residents in the nearby town of Enerhodar to lie to the IAEA representatives about events at the plant and “sign things”. Grossi insisted he and his team had seen “everything I request to see”, but he conceded he was not able to talk to any of the Russian soldiers who have commandeered the plant’s crisis centre as their headquarters. “The military presence there did not approach us in any way and were not available when I asked for a couple of occasions to talk to one of them,” he said. The IAEA chief said an alternative crisis centre has been set up but added that he will be requesting the military to hand back the purpose built facility they are occupying. Grossi left six of his staff behind at the site, but four of them will leave next week, leaving two IAEA experts there permanently. The IAEA is there to stay for as long as it is needed. We are not leaving. We’re not going anywhere,” Grossi said. “For those who may have intentions on the plant, knowing that international inspectors are there, witnessing and informing immediately what is happening, has an inherently very important stabilising effect.” Ukraine and Russia have traded blame over attacks on and near the plant, with Ukraine claiming they are false-flag operations carried out by Russia. Zelenskiy also voiced concerns over Ukrainian and international journalists not being allowed to travel with the delegation, as previously agreed. He said the occupying forces did not allow the journalists to cross the frontlines. “Unfortunately, IAEA representatives did not protect representatives of independent media,” said Zelenskiy, who said only Russian propagandists were present. Zelenskiy said the key thing for Ukraine and the international community was the demilitarisation of the plant. He said it was “bad that we have not yet heard the appropriate calls [for demilitarisation] from the IAEA”. Russian state media have published videos of Russian officials from Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear agency, giving the mission a tour of the plant. Grossi said his agency would complete a full report on the visit by early next week and he would brief the UN security council on the visit next Tuesday. The Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, told Ukraine’s 1+1 television channel that “it is important for us that the station must be under national control, meaning that the station must be returned to the control of Ukraine”. Grossi said the security situation was “pretty difficult” during his visit. “There were moments where fire was obvious, heavy machine gun, artillery, mortars two or three times – we were very concerned.” But he said the mission received “splendid support from the UN security team”. “I think we showed that the international community is there, could be there and we will be continuing this,” Grossi said. Zaporizhzhia, has faced repeated shelling in recent weeks, with Kyiv and Moscow blaming each other for the attacks, raising concerns of a possible disaster. On Thursday, a dawn shelling attack on the area forced one of the plant’s six reactors to shut down. On Friday afternoon the electricity supply to a reactor was reconnected after it was cut for the second time in 10 days because of shelling, according to Energoatom. The plant needs electricity for its cooling and security systems. In the event all supply lines are cut, the plant’s workers would have 90 minutes to avoid dangerous overheating. In a video address late on Thursday, Zelenskiy reiterated his frequent calls that all troops be removed from the plant. “The main thing that must happen is the demilitarisation of the station’s territory,” he said. “Demilitarisation and full control of Ukrainian nuclear workers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/dec/26/washington-state-energy-station-attacked-christmas-day","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-26T16:16:11Z","webTitle":"More than 14,000 in Washington state lose power after energy station attacked","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/26/washington-state-energy-station-attacked-christmas-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/dec/26/washington-state-energy-station-attacked-christmas-day","fields":{"bodyText":"More than 14,000 people suffered power outages in Washington state on Christmas Day following burglaries and a series of vandalisms at different power stations. The Pierce county sheriff said in two statements that no suspects had yet been identified for the incidents. The Christmas Day outages add to an alarming and increasing list of similar incidents in the US. There were six attacks across power stations in Oregon and Washington earlier this month, following a similar attack on a power grid in North Carolina at the beginning of December. In the attack in North Carolina, assailants shot gunfire into two stations, with some claiming that it was done in order to halt a local drag show. While there are no suspects in the string of attacks, there are concerns that at least some of these assaults are carried out by extremists, motivated by online conspiracy theories and pursuing a far-right agenda. The most recent incident in Washington unfolded on Christmas evening with a fire on the premises of Puget Sound Energy substation following a burglary. “The suspect(s) gained access to the fenced area and vandalized the equipment which caused the fire,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement on Sunday. Early on Christmas morning, around 2.30am, an energy utility company Puget Sound Energy experienced a power outage “where the fenced area was broken into and the equipment vandalized”, said another statement from the sheriff’s office. At about 5.30am, a break-in and vandalism in a Tacoma Public Utilities facility about 10 miles away, led to a power outage. Following that, just a couple of miles away, there was a “forced entry” at a substation where nothing was stolen. Tacoma Public Utilities said in a statement on Sunday that the issue was much more severe than they had initially thought. “Unfortunately, the impacts to our system from today’s deliberate damage are more severe in some places than initial testing indicated,” they said on Sunday evening in an update in a live feed on Facebook. Sgt Darren Moss of Pierce county sheriff’s department has said it was likely the incidents are related. “There’s a good possibility they are related, we are going to be investigating to see if this was coordinated by a specific group or people,” he told news station KING 5, “but at this time all we know is that we have burglaries where the power was purposefully knocked out.” Of those affected, more than 7,000 customers were out of power before the sun was up on Christmas morning, KING 5 reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/apr/24/the-elephant-artworks-interrogating-korean-life-when-we-get-rid-of-the-power-structure-what-will-we-see","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-23T15:00:43Z","webTitle":"The elephant artworks interrogating Korean life: ‘When we get rid of the power structure, what will we see?’ ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/24/the-elephant-artworks-interrogating-korean-life-when-we-get-rid-of-the-power-structure-what-will-we-see","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/24/the-elephant-artworks-interrogating-korean-life-when-we-get-rid-of-the-power-structure-what-will-we-see","fields":{"bodyText":"It’s a strange sight at an art exhibition. While people mill around, respectfully observing works from a distance, some walk towards a white sculpture with their arms outstretched. Then they put their hands directly on to it: the cardinal art sin. But this artwork doesn’t just invite touch – it depends on it. Wool and fabric cover a 3m x 3m, 500kg iron skeleton. The figure looks at once familiar and alien: its large ears and thick legs are instantly recognisable but there is no tail, trunk or face. Touching the elephant, something stirs. On display at the 14th Gwangju Biennale, the South Korean artist Oum Jeongsoon’s Elephant Without Trunk is the inaugural winner of the art show’s $100,000 Park Seo-Bo art prize. It’s the latest instalment in her ongoing project, Another Way of Seeing, which draws from experiences of difference to suggest new modes of understanding the world. “In my art career, I usually deal with the topic of what it means to see,” Oum says from Kote, an art space in Seoul’s bustling Insa-dong district. It’s days after the prize announcement, and the artist, who was born in the central province of Chungju in 1961, speaks mostly through an interpreter, Ho Bin Kim. “It was a natural process for me to also question what it means to not see.” Oum launched Another Way of Seeing in 1996, beginning as an art teacher for blind school students before starting her own workshops. Since 2008, she has been fascinated by elephants, after reading about the first elephant to arrive on the Korean peninsula via Indonesia 600 years ago as a gift from Japan. After the creature trampled a government official who mocked its appearance, it was exiled to the southern Jangdo Island. There’s a loneliness in this story that comes across in Oum’s works. Her award-winning piece, she says, “represents the current situation of minorities in Korea … I’m looking at the similarities between oppressed groups and the elephant, who was going around as a stranger”. Oum’s first elephant workshop took place at Gwangju’s Uchi Park zoo, giving the biennale prize additional significance. The blind students touched the elephants and shared what they felt through art. A workshop in Chiang Mai, Thailand, with disabled or ill elephants, offered a new depth. “We spent four days in the sanctuary, cleaning the animals’ poop and eating together. During that time, not only did they touch, but they also had the ability to hear and smell,” Oum says. “Because both the animals and the students had a disability, when the students were asked to create a narrative, they could really sympathise with the elephants and create products that are phenomenal.” Oum’s works inspired by these workshops have included paintings and mixed media, depicting elephants at various stages of their journeys. Commissioned for the Gwangju Biennale, Elephant Without Trunk includes three related works – some older that have been newly covered in wool. The trunk’s absence forces a new perspective of a familiar form. “When we visualise an elephant, the first thing we think about is its nose,” Oum says. “It represents power and hierarchy, and I wanted to make a connection to our society: when we get rid of the power structure, what will we see?” The work’s tactility invites the audience to experience the animal through different senses. I’m awash in childlike wonder as I feel the wool beneath my fingers, closing my eyes to immerse myself fully. “When you touch the wool, you get an immediate sense of something inside of you,” Oum says. Of course, works are usually not to be touched for preservation’s sake. Was there concern about degradation? “When I made this piece, I assumed that there would be damages,” Oum says. “I was quite surprised to see some damage already happening but I was also happy, because it means that a lot of people came to see my work.” The artwork will require regular maintenance as it continues its life at the biennale. Winning the Park Seo-Bo prize – named after one of Korea’s preeminent contemporary artists – is a boon for Oum after a long career that has gone largely unrecognised. “It was a cheer for what I have done for quite some time,” she says. “Community art involving non-artists is quite a new form of art and, in the eyes of a very conventional field in Korea, it has been underestimated. “Winning this prize gave me assurance, because many very well-established judges were involved. One [piece of] feedback from the judges was that it was visually satisfying, as well as portraying our current society and era very well.” The prize money will allow the artist to further investigate the possibilities of her dual projects. “What it means to see is a very fundamental question that artists have been asking for ages,” she says. “Because it doesn’t have a clear answer, I can use it as a pivot point to explore many other fields. As a person who works with images, asking these questions is what drives me to continue.” Oum and Kim laugh, before the interpreter turns to me: “She said that if I know the answer, please don’t tell.” The 14th Gwangju Biennale, Soft and Weak Like Water, is on at the Gwangju Biennale Exhibition Hall and various sites throughout the city until 9 July Guardian Australia travelled to South Korea courtesy of the Gwangju Biennale"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/sep/20/queens-stirring-funeral-shows-the-power-of-pageantry","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-20T17:02:41Z","webTitle":"Queen’s stirring funeral shows the power of pageantry  | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/20/queens-stirring-funeral-shows-the-power-of-pageantry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/sep/20/queens-stirring-funeral-shows-the-power-of-pageantry","fields":{"bodyText":"No country other than the UK could put on such a spectacle (Queen Elizabeth II: from public pomp to a private family farewell, 19 September). Not a single person out of step. Trumpets, drums, bagpipes, all heralding the end of an era. Cannons firing, bells ringing, Big Ben chiming, choirboys singing. Row upon row of servicemen and servicewomen, faces etched in solemn regard. Columns of guardsmen, helmets gleaming, plumes wafting, bearskins bobbing. Line after line passes soberly by – a river of scarlet and gold in an ocean of black. The crowds bear witness to it all, a nation joined as one in solidarity for a queen the like of which we will never see again. Unforgettable. Jon Goldney Gawler, South Australia • I am on vacation from the US in the UK. While not normally a royal follower, I decided that I had to do the British thing and watch the Queen’s funeral. It was impressive. I am glad I live in a world that still has pageantry. I am glad I live in a world that can still have things that serve no practical purpose, such as kings and queens, and soldiers who have swords on their belts, fur on their hats, and move like trained dancers. I hope that there will always be room in this world for soldiers who aren’t carrying guns. Emily Anne Lyons Annandale, New Jersey, US • Charlotte Higgins (It was a gilded royal funeral, an event that will only heighten our self-delusion, 20 September) pretty much said what I feel, and the historical details she added – about the disastrous funeral of George IV, for example – were fascinating. Let us hope that there will be far fewer feathers the next time. I was particularly impressed by her careful use of the word “fulsome” to describe the BBC’s commentary. A shame she felt that she had to add the words “and mawkish” after it in order not to be misunderstood. Michael Bulley Chalon-sur-Saône, France • If Charlotte Higgins was reminded of RSC productions of Shakespeare’s history plays, the image may have been reinforced by the BBC camera picking out the portrait of one king in the abbey: Richard II. John Pelling Coddenham, Suffolk • The mood of gritty realism that describes life in modern Britain (unemployment, food bank visits, unplanned pregnancies) was briefly punctured in Ambridge on Monday when a funeral was briefly mentioned in The Archers, after the actual event had taken place in a parallel unreal world. At least the whole of the BBC did not succumb to royal overkill. John Petrie Leeds • How do you explain to granddaughters aged 10 and eight why not a single girl chorister was included in the three choirs represented at the Queen’s obsequies? There was one woman among the altos at St George’s chapel in Windsor, presumably brought in to beef up that line a bit. Girls sing the treble line just as beautifully as boys do, and it is high time we scrapped this ridiculous Anglican cathedral tradition, as they have already done at a few cathedrals. Tully Potter Tonbridge, Kent • Farewell to the Queen. The funeral was emotional; it made us proud of our country. It also felt like the last hurrah of the British empire. The last hurrah of a former world power. Hubert Schmitz Brighton, East Sussex • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Kim, who last month said the North’s transformation into a nuclear power was “irreversible,” said the drills were “an obvious warning and clear demonstration” to the country’s enemies. The regime’s short-range tactical nuclear missiles would be unable to reach its nemesis – the US – but could theoretically be used against the South and Japan. In a report carried on Monday, the state news agency KCNA said that Kim had ordered the test launches in response to large-scale navy drills by South Korean and US forces. Tokyo and Washington recently resumed the exercises, including the deployment of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier the USS Ronald Reagan to waters off the east coast of South Korea – a move that infuriated Pyongyang, where the drills are seen as a rehearsal for an invasion. In response, North Korea “decided to organise military drills under the simulation of an actual war,” KCNA reported. Army units involved in “the operation of tactical nukes, staged military drills from 25 September to 9 October in order to check and assess the war deterrent and nuclear counterattack capability of the country,” the report said, confirming that Kim had personally directed the exercises. Official photographs showed Kim at all of the missile launches and exercises, giving orders and posing with smiling soldiers. “They’re pursuing a tactical nuclear weapon for sure,” said US-based security analyst Ankit Panda. “I suspect they’ll gradually nuclearise many of their new short-range missiles, including the manoeuvring missiles.” The fact that North Korea has described all seven of its recent missile launches as being linked to “tactical nuclear operations units” is significant, he added, since the inventory includes everything from short-range and intermediate-range ballistic missiles, to a new short-range missile designed to be launched from a submarine. Kim, who has presided over dramatic improvements in missile and nuclear development despite years of UN sanctions, has long wanted to acquire tactical nuclear weapons – smaller, lighter weapons designed for battlefield use – and made it a top priority at a key party congress in January 2021. Last month, North Korea revised its nuclear laws to enable it to conduct preemptive nuclear strikes, including in response to conventional attacks. Kim guided exercises by the country’s nuclear tactical operation units over the past two weeks, involving ballistic missiles with mock nuclear warheads, KCNA said, adding that they were meant to deliver a strong deterrent message. “The effectiveness and practical combat capability of our nuclear combat force were fully demonstrated as it stands completely ready to hit and destroy targets at any time from any location,” KCNA quoted Kim as saying. “Even though the enemy continues to talk about dialogue and negotiations, we do not have anything to talk about nor do we feel the need to do so.” The various tests simulated targeting military command facilities, striking main ports, and neutralising airports in the South. Tactical nuclear weapons South Korean and US officials say there are signs North Korea could soon detonate a new nuclear device in underground tunnels at its Punggye-ri nuclear test site, which was officially closed in 2018. Analysts say putting small warheads on short-range missiles could represent a dangerous change in the way North Korea deploys and plans to use nuclear weapons. On 4 October, the North test-fired a ballistic missile farther than ever before, flying what it said was a new intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japan for the first time since 2017. Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said North Korea had “multiple motivations” for publicising the launches. “Kim Jong-un’s public appearance after a month-long absence provides a patriotic headline to mark (Monday’s) founding anniversary of the ruling Workers’ party,” Easley said. “Pyongyang has been concerned about military exercises by the US, South Korea and Japan, so to strengthen its self-proclaimed deterrent, it is making explicit the nuclear threat behind its recent missile launches,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/dec/27/the-rings-of-power-to-conversations-with-friends-2022s-tv-letdowns","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-27T11:00:20Z","webTitle":"The Rings of Power to Conversations With Friends: 2022’s TV letdowns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/27/the-rings-of-power-to-conversations-with-friends-2022s-tv-letdowns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/27/the-rings-of-power-to-conversations-with-friends-2022s-tv-letdowns","fields":{"bodyText":"Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story Oof, this $300m Netflix deal is not going well. Ryan Murphy – once renowned as the very Midas of soapy, campy television – has had a stock market crash this year on a par with the streaming giant’s own plummet. (Who’s working on the Venn diagram?) Murphy would once make hit after hit that hooked us without fail. This year, his output has gone from the outright tedious to the truly sickening. The worst offender was Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, which despite being grisly, nauseating and fetishistic about a serial killer who ate some of his victims, rode high in the Netflix charts for weeks on end. The other Murphian show that nearly made the cut here was The Watcher, which starred Jennifer Coolidge but was ultimately a duff thriller about a typewriter. Let’s hope Murphy’s next series of Feud – in which Truman Capote makes delicious rifts in New York high society – makes up for all this awfulness. The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power Given the horrific racism that swirled around this show’s casting of non-white actors, as well as the glorious stand that Lord of the Rings stars past and present took against it, it’s not easy to say unkind things about this fantasy drama. But the fact remains that the show was a masterclass in mediocrity. Visually, it was stunning – but it needed to be, given that its reported billion dollar production budget supposedly made it the most expensive TV show ever created. However, its storylines were glacially tedious, its acting – with the exception of Morfydd Clark’s Galadriel – comically po-faced, and in the maddeningly twee harfoots and their Oirish accents, it created a set of characters that were like Jar Jar Binks for a new milennium – if Jar Jar Binks had been so offensively stereotypical he was borderline xenophobic. Given the amount of money this burned through for a show that launched during a cost of living crisis, it’s tempting to ask whether this series was the worst value TV ever created – and hard not to respond with a resounding “yes”. Conversations With Friends After the huge success of Normal People, this adaptation of Sally Rooney’s debut novel should have also been a hit. As the story of an affair unravelled, all the Rooneyisms were there: tightly packed dialogue, observations on class, growth and identity, a lot of longing stares, and endless space for intimacy. But what it lacked was a screen couple worth investing in – Nick and Frances were drips, and you had to sit through what felt like 27 hours to get to the real relationship of the story (Frances and Bobbi). Brilliant book; absolute snoozefest of a series. Chivalry With comedy giants Steve Coogan and Sarah Solemani at the helm, and guest stars including Sienna Miller, Lolly Adefope and Wanda Sykes, this should have been a searing swipe at Hollywood in the #MeToo era. As Coogan’s character – a top producer terrified of being cancelled – meets the indie director (Solemani) he’s enlisted to help with his problematic new film, the sex scene they work on initially made it look as though we were in for a nuanced series with some sharp gags, which was never too on-the-nose. But it quickly drifted off and became confused about what it was, with the comedy faltering as the show went on. And the romcom-style ending was just bewildering – at no point were you rooting for them to get together. For a project that could have said so much about the state of things, it’s hard to remember what was said in it at all. Ten Percent In a world that seems to be populated by a new streaming service every few weeks, there should be no end of thrilling new stories to binge watch at will. So it was a curious and misguided decision by the ravine-deep pocketed Prime Video to commission an entirely pointless remake of the French hit Call My Agent. That show – about a bunch of chic, zingy agents to the stars – steadily became a word-of-mouth smash, snaring more A-listers to play their clients by the day. In the end, Juliette Binoche and Sigourney Weaver were banging the door down to be “represented” by the Agence Samuel Kerr. So why did Prime bother to make a lazy reproduction that was essentially a shot-for-shot knock-off? Even having the likes of John Morton of W1A fame as the writer didn’t lend this its own witty or satirical voice. Some of the British stars were worth a watch (Dominic West, in particular). But fans of the original knew exactly what we were letting ourselves in for – a British cast bringing a rehashed storyline absolutely no je ne sais quoi. Peaky Blinders There was much to love about this last season, from the tense opening barfight to the finale shootout with the IRA, which was so disorientingly murky and gas-filled it felt otherworldly. But it struggled to ever quite get going, with the first five episodes dragging their feet in a way that began to frustrate. No season of a show as good as this will ever be genuinely bad TV, but compared to previous outings, it lacked zing – not exactly what you’d expect for a series that was meant to be Tommy Shelby’s televisual swansong. In the end, the final scenes stopped short of offering any solid explanation for this being the end of the gang leader’s small-screen journey, serving only as setup for the forthcoming film. Not quite the definitive farewell we hoped for. The Witchfinder Given the stellar roster of comic talent involved in this sitcom, you’d expect it to be topping lists of the year’s best shows. Tim Key starred as a hapless witchfinder taking suspected witch Daisy May Cooper to trial, in a script written by the Gibbon brothers, the brains behind Alan Partridge’s renaissance. Despite seemingly every minor part being filled by a comic luminary – Ghosts’ Kiell Smith-Bynoe as hired muscle here, Julian Barratt as a fellow witchfinder there – it lacked the solid gags its pedigree demanded. No question that the stars shone in their roles, but it struggled to ever make you genuinely laugh. Midwich Cuckoos You’re usually on to a good thing when Keeley Hawes is involved. That said, last year’s Finding Alice was awful, as was this year’s Crossfire, and this adaptation of John Wyndham’s 1957 sci-fi book completes her terrible TV trifecta (although Hawes’s turn as psychotherapist Dr Susannah Zellaby is probably the only good thing about it). As Hawes embarked on her mission to get to the bottom of what all the freaky children of Midwich are up to, the parents’ glacial realisation that they’d spawned little creeps was borderline comical – given their terrifyingly stony stares and 1970s haircuts. The acting was mostly bad, the budget felt very low and the story offered nothing new in the context of women’s reproductive rights in 2022, which – as the women all become pregnant at once without realising – felt like a wasted opportunity. Killing Eve This adaptation of the Villanelle novels has long been on the slide, but this series reached new lows. A far cry from the days when Phoebe Waller-Bridge was involved and it was one of TV’s finest shows, its plot was increasingly nonsensical, it inexplicably lacked the fabulous couture outfits it was once feted for and it wrapped up with an ending containing such a disappointingly anti-LGBTQ trope that the author of the original books felt compelled to write a whole article disclaiming it. What a shame. Pistol National treasure Danny Boyle directs the iconic tale of Sex Pistols, as depicted in guitarist Steve Jones’s moving and funny autobiography: a guarantee of success, you might think. But this six-part Disney+ adaptation fell flat, with cartoonish characters that made the show feel like pantomime. What should have been absolutely spectacular TV instead felt tonally odd – and it never quite landed its attempt to bridge nihilism and sentimentality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/dec/14/over-100-engineers-work-to-restore-power-to-thousands-of-shetland-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-14T13:00:41Z","webTitle":"Over 100 engineers work to restore power to thousands of Shetland homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/14/over-100-engineers-work-to-restore-power-to-thousands-of-shetland-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/dec/14/over-100-engineers-work-to-restore-power-to-thousands-of-shetland-homes","fields":{"bodyText":"More than 100 engineers are being sent to Shetland after heavy snowstorms cut power to thousands of homes, many of which face being without electricity until the end of this week. A major incident has been declared, with householders urged to remain at home after heavy loads of ice and snow brought down electricity lines to nearly 4,000 homes earlier this week. With 2,800 homes still without power, Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said 15 emergency crews had arrived by ferry at Lerwick early on Wednesday morning, with emergency generators being used in some places. The power company said other crews would arrive from mainland Scotland and Orkney during the day and into Thursday by plane, ferry and helicopter, taking the number of extra engineers sent to Shetland to 125. Graeme Keddie, SSEN’s director of corporate affairs, told BBC Radio Scotland: “This has been a very concentrated and explosive weather event on Shetland, which has been far worse than expected. Local crews say it is the worst they have seen it since 1995.” The storm brought down parts of Shetland’s main 33kV electricity network cutting power to homes on Voe, Whalsay, Brae, Yell and West Mainland. SSEN has deployed a helicopter to help survey the damage. Customers in West Mainland are likely to be without power until the weekend. The crime writer Ann Cleeves issued an appeal for help after losing a laptop in the storm containing half of her new novel. She had searched for the “scruffy” Hewlett Packard device in Mareel arts centre and the public library in Lerwick without success. Cleeves, the author of the Shetland series of crime novels, tweeted: All of the islands’ schools remained closed, with Sumburgh airport, the main airport for Shetland, closed overnight by further snow. Leisure centres were also shut. Emma Macdonald, the leader of Shetland Islands council, told the BBC the weather was unusual. A car journey that should normally take 25 minutes took her five hours during Monday’s storm. “The community is very resilient, as an island we have to be, and we have seen a lot of community support, everyone pulling together to do what they can,” she said. “There is a lot of snow, a lot of wet snow and it is sticking on the lines which is the issue. It is very unprecedented, I don’t think it can be blamed on the electricity company.” SSEN said it would fund emergency accommodation costs for vulnerable households on its priority services register and pay up to £30 a day to cover hot food costs for those able to travel to areas with power. The islands had a serious communications outage for several days in October, when two undersea cables were cut, leaving many islanders without mobile, computer and landline telephone services. Fishing trawlers are thought to have snagged the cables, which connected Shetland to mainland Scotland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"food/2022/may/22/majestic-regains-its-power-as-it-goes-back-to-its-roots","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-22T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"Majestic regains its power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/may/22/majestic-regains-its-power-as-it-goes-back-to-its-roots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/may/22/majestic-regains-its-power-as-it-goes-back-to-its-roots","fields":{"bodyText":"Casal de Ventozela Vinho Verde, Portugal 2021 (£9.99, or £7.99 as part of a mixed case of six bottles, majestic.co.uk) With many of its traditional competitors having departed to the great High Street in the sky, and the rest no more than shadows of their former selves, Majestic is now comfortably the UK’s biggest bricks and mortar specialist wine retailer, with more than 200 stores. Since its acquisition by the American Fortress Investment Group in 2019, the retailer, which seemed to be struggling to survive in the last of its days as part of the Naked Wines set-up, has been having a bit of a revival, helped, as so many wine retailers were, by the pandemic boom in at-home wine drinking. Tasting a selection of its current range earlier this month, it occurred to me that the current Majestic has remembered its original raison d’être: offering a much better, more varied range than the supermarkets at similar (if you buy by the mixed case) prices. Case in point: this textbook, snappy, subtly spritzy Vinho Verde dry white. Domaine des Herbauges Luminescence Brut, Loire, France NV (£15.99, or £12.99 as part of a mixed case of six bottles, majestic.co.uk) Other good-value whites in the Majestic range include a pair of offbeat choices with at least one foot in northern Spain. Agricola Fuster Dardell Organic White 2020 (£10.99, or £8.99 as part of a mixed six) is a good example of the fleshy, stone-fruited wines made from garnacha blanca (plus, in this case, viognier) from the improving Catalan wine region, Terra Alta. Alois Lageder Terra Alpina Organic Bianco 2021 (£14.99, or £10.99 as part of a mixed six), meanwhile, is the fruit of a curious project by winemakers Clemens and Helena Lageder from Italy’s far northern Alto-Adige region: a gently rippling, floral blend of organic grapes from their own vineyards, with others sourced from Hungary and the Pyrenees. The retailer is also good at finding well-priced character-filled sparkling wine, not least Domaine des Herbauges’ Atlantic-influenced Loire fizz, with its saline brightness and refreshing clarity and zip. Emiliana Vigno Organic Carignan, Maule, Chile 2016 (£19.99, or £14.99 as part of a mixed case of six bottles, majestic.co.uk) Staying with sparkling, Majestic has two bottles from one of the best-value Champagne houses in the business: the elegantly racy, subtlest-of-pinks Devaux Oeil De Perdrix Rosé Champagne NV (£27.99, or £24.99 as part of a mixed six) and the richly savoury Devaux Blanc de Noirs Champagne NV (£29.99, or £25.99 as part of a mixed six). For bargain reds, Jean Chatelier Les Davaines Gamay 2021 is a brisk, crunchy, sappy berries-and-currants chillable summer red from the Coteaux-du-Lyonnais vineyards betwixt Beaujolais and the Rhône (£8.99, or £6.99 as part of a mixed six), while, at the other end of the flavour and textural spectrum, Polvanera Organic Primitivo 2020 from Puglia in southern Italy (£10.99, or £8.99 as part of a mixed six) is full of luscious fleshy plum and fig, dark cherry and baking spice.

She somehow selected the wrong address from a drop-down menu, inputting ours instead. We have been paying our gas bills by direct debit as usual but started getting bills to an unknown person so sent them back thinking they had the wrong address. Having finally opened the most recent one last week, we were shocked to discover the company has gone to court for nonpayment and is about to break down our door and install a new meter. We have been on the phone for the past three days but keep getting passed from department to department, with no one willing, or able, to halt this. We don’t owe this company any money. Please, please help. SS, London This is a great example of why you should always open letters sent to your address, even if you have never heard of the person named. Clearly this was in no way your fault – but it could have been dealt with much earlier had you opened the mail. Equally, this was not of Scottish Power’s making. The supplier to which your neighbour was trying to switch, Entice Energy, later collapsed and Scottish Power inherited its customers and debts. However, the company could have acted better and halted proceedings after you got in touch. Telling you, as it did, that there was nothing that could be done to stop the warrant from being carried out was cavalier, to say the least. Fortunately, after I contacted the firm, someone in the press office was able to halt the action at the 11th hour, and your front door remains intact. Had we not got involved, and had the meter change gone ahead, it would have been an expensive nightmare to sort out. Scottish Power has apologised for the “distress and frustration you experienced due to the previous supplier’s failures”. It says: “We will remove all debt and late payment fees from the account, as well as making a payment to their account as a gesture of goodwill.” You are just hugely relieved, and, I suspect, will be opening any future letters that turn up.

It’s a series of fearless moments that centre on intersectional feminism and reclamation of power, underpinned by a soundtrack of clattering drums and jagged, dissonant guitars. The result is a record that is equally vulnerable, triumphant and cathartic. “I’m just the dumb bitch that left the party with you,” vocalist Róisín Nic Ghearailt sing-speaks on spicky opener Asking for It, which unflinchingly tackles rape culture. As the track builds, the guitars become thick and gluey and Ghearailt’s voice rises to a roar: “My whole life won’t be defined by you.” It’s the heaviest track on an album where most of the songs build from bare bones, the instrumentation disjointed and primal, allowing a message of self-acceptance to dominate. Bisexual Anxiety and Femme push back against “the black and white space of monosexuality” – you can hear Ghearailt’s eyes rolling as she sings: “I should have cut my hair off when I knew I was queer / It would have made it easier on everyone here.” Closing track Period Sex provides a lusty, heavy-breathing highlight, Ghearailt savouring the refrain of “I want to make a mess” with coquettish, gleeful defiance as a kaleidoscopic guitar ebbs and flows.

Construction is set to begin in 2024. The project will employ as many as 2,000 people during construction and 250 once operational in a state where the coal industry has been shedding jobs. Kemmerer, one of four cities in the running to host the project, is home to 2,600 people and is located about 130 miles (210 km) north-east of Salt Lake City. If it’s as reliable as conventional nuclear power, the 345-megawatt plant would produce enough climate-friendly power to serve about 250,000 homes. The announcement came days after world leaders met at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and chairman of TerraPower, in June announced plans for the Wyoming project along with officials from Rocky Mountain Power, Joe Biden’s administration and the state of Wyoming, which produces about 40% of the nation’s coal. “We think Natrium will be a gamechanger for the energy industry,” Gates said at the project’s launch in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Proponents of the project, which will feature a sodium-cooled fast reactor and molten salt energy storage, say it would perform better, be safer and cost less than traditional nuclear power. “Natrium will be that next improvement on safety. Importantly it won’t rely on outside sources of power, pumps and extra equipment to help the plant recover in the event of an emergency,” said Levesque, referring to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster caused by a tsunami that knocked out emergency generators. The high heat-transfer properties of sodium will allow the Natrium plant to be air-cooled. That will enable the plant to be quickly shut down in case of an emergency, and the absence of emergency generators and pumps will save on costs, Levesque said. Others are skeptical about the benefits of sodium compared with water for cooling as in conventional nuclear plants. “The use of liquid sodium has many problems. It’s a very volatile material that can catch fire if it’s exposed to air or water,” said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety with the Union of Concerned Scientists science advocacy non-profit. Countries including the US have experimented with sodium-cooled fast reactors for decades but only Russia has fielded such a reactor on a large, power-producing scale, Lyman said. “Honestly I don’t understand the motivation,” Lyman said. “There are some people who are just strong advocates for it and they’ve sort of won the day here by convincing Bill Gates that this is a good technology to pursue.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/14/australias-nuclear-waste-is-growing-as-battle-over-dump-site-heats-up","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-13T23:30:21Z","webTitle":"Australia’s nuclear waste is growing as battle over dump site heats up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/14/australias-nuclear-waste-is-growing-as-battle-over-dump-site-heats-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/14/australias-nuclear-waste-is-growing-as-battle-over-dump-site-heats-up","fields":{"bodyText":"Australia is accumulating more intermediate-level nuclear waste than previously thought, a new inventory has found, as the battle over a nuclear waste dump heats up. After 40 years of different governments talking about a national nuclear waste facility, the Morrison government chose a site near the town of Kimba in South Australia. But the local Barngarla people are united against the plan, and have vowed to keep fighting to stop it happening. The federal resources minister, Madeleine King, said the waste “cannot continue to build up” and she would continue to work with the Barngarla people to protect the cultural heritage of the site and deliver economic benefit to the traditional custodians. Opponents of the site hope the new Labor government will be more likely to abandon the plan, but King said the government was committed to “progressing the facility”. Most of Australia’s nuclear waste is low-level waste (LLW), which tends to be items such as paper and gloves from laboratories that emit small amounts of radioactivity. The rest, intermediate-level waste (ILW), comes from the production of nuclear medicine – which is used, for example, in imaging, scanning and radiotherapy. It emits more radiation, breaks down more slowly and needs stricter shielding measures. The Australian Radioactive Waste Agency (Arwa) recently updated its inventory of waste, to inform the development of the Kimba facility. It found there was 2,061 cubic metres of intermediate-level waste in 2021, compared to 1,771 cubic metres in 2018. And it projects 4,377 cubic metres in the next 50 years, compared to 3,734 cubic metres projected in 2018. Arwa notes that more waste categories and holders were included in 2021, increasing the current levels of waste, and that estimates for future years were revised. Currently waste is stored in more than 100 places around the nation, but most of it is held at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto) facilities in Lucas Heights, Sydney. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Australian Conservation Foundation and others argue that Ansto should be expanded to become the national storage site. The chief executive of Arwa, Sam Usher, wrote in the report that Kimba would be used to dispose of Australia’s LLW, and to hold ILW temporarily while a permanent solution was found. “To ensure the facility has capacity to house Australia’s current and future waste holdings, Arwa has undertaken extensive work to provide an updated national inventory of radioactive waste,” he wrote. The Kimba site was announced after an Australian Electoral Commission ballot found the majority of the people in the council area were in favour. However, that ballot did not include Aboriginal people who count the area as part of their traditional lands. The Barngarla Determination Aboriginal Corporation chair, Jason Bilney, said his people were never consulted, and they are unanimously opposed. “We were excluded,” he said. “Unanimously, we do not want it on our country. “We’ll keep fighting this.” Bilney said his people were organising a rally in Port Augusta on Saturday to remind people what is happening. He said his concern was that the site would start accepting waste from outside Australia. He also said it made more sense for the Lucas Heights facility to expand into waste storage, because the proposed Kimba site was only meant to be temporary storage for ILW anyway, with a permanent site yet to be determined. “Why would you keep kicking the can down the road?” he said. There was an ongoing court process with Barngarla people fighting for access to government documents, and King said she would not “pre-empt” the outcome of that. She said nuclear medicine, which most Australians benefit from at some point, produced radioactive waste. “We need to be responsible for the waste we create, and this includes developing permanent disposal solutions,” she said. “I will continue to work with the Barngarla people and the local community – those for and against the proposal – as we move forward. “While there is no native title on the site, the government is committed to progressing the facility in a way that protects cultural heritage and delivers economic benefit to the traditional custodians.” The site is freehold, but on the traditional lands of the Barngarla. Dave Sweeney, the ACF’s nuclear free campaigner, said there was room at Lucas Heights, and pointed to $60m awarded to Ansto in 2021 to expand its storage. “That’s approved,” he said. “It’s been through the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (Arpansa).” “Arpansa has said that it’s consistent with international best practice and that means that material can be safely stored there for decades to come. So they’ve got the capacity, they’re actually growing the capacity.” The South Australian Labor premier, Peter Malinauskas, supports the Barngarla people, and says he will try to influence the federal Labor government."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/dec/23/us-weather-bomb-cyclone-us-christmas-latest","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-23T22:03:01Z","webTitle":"‘Once in a generation’ freeze for Christmas as bomb cyclone hits US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/23/us-weather-bomb-cyclone-us-christmas-latest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/dec/23/us-weather-bomb-cyclone-us-christmas-latest","fields":{"bodyText":"The winter storm that forecasters dubbed Elliott intensified into a bomb cyclone near the Great Lakes on Friday, bringing high winds and blizzard conditions from the Northern Plains to western and upstate New York, along with life-threatening flooding, flash-freezing and travel chaos as it went. Airline cancellations topped 5,700 flights, with tens of thousands of holiday travellers grounded in airports with limited expectations of making further progress. Travel on the roads was disrupted due snowy weather or crashes and authorities in parts of Indiana, Michigan, New York and Ohio urged motorists to avoid nonessential travel. Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN the US aviation system “is operating under enormous strain”. About 10% of US flights were canceled on Thursday, Buttigieg said. The storm, estimated to be 2,000 miles wide, has produced driving snow and plummeting temperatures, knocking out power from Texas to Maine. Officials ordered cars off the roads as US forecasters warned of “potentially crippling impacts across central and eastern” parts of the country. The arrival of the arctic blast produced widespread disruption to utilities, with more than 1.5m households estimated to be without power. At the White House, after Joe Biden was briefed on Elliott, the president said: “This is not like a snow day when you were a kid. This is serious stuff.” About 200 million people in the 48 contiguous states were under extreme weather alerts, said forecaster Bob Oravec of the National Weather Service (NWS). An advisory warned that the powerful cold front would engulf the eastern US tonight “with widespread dangerous cold expected to continue across much of the eastern two-thirds of the US into the holiday weekend”. “Rapid temperature drops, sometimes 50 or more degrees colder than the previous day,” Oravec told the Associated Press. “It’s a pretty powerful system.” The precipitous drop in temperatures was accompanied by high winds. A 79-mph gust was recorded in downtown Buffalo, New York, where snow fall produced a rare “zero visibilty” observation at the airport. “There are some people in Buffalo saying this is one of the worst storms they’ve ever seen,” said the city’s mayor, Byron W Brown. “Buffalo is used to dealing with normal snowfall. We are dealing with it fine, but certainly it is a very challenging storm”. In Ohio, what was described as a “mass casualty incident” was declared on Interstate 75 after more than 100 vehicles piled up in the conditions. The police department in Memphis, Tennessee, said a man found on Union Avenue on Friday had died from exposure to the frosty weather. Forecasters had said the scale of the weather pattern was nearly unprecedented in its scope, exposing than 200 million people – about 60% of the US population – to some sort of winter advisory or warning. The weather service’s map “depicts one of the greatest extents of winter weather warnings and advisories ever,” forecasters said. Tens of thousands of homes have been left without power, and governors in at least 13 states have drawn up emergency response plans, including National Guard deployments, for the holiday weekend, with heavy snow and ice creating treacherous road conditions and some drivers stranded. Temperatures in Colorado on Thursday dipped to a record-breaking low of -9F (-22.7C) from 42F (5.5C), while Cheyenne, Wyoming, recorded its greatest one-hour temperature drop, plunging from 43F to 3F in the space of 30 minutes. The NWS said temperatures of -50F to -70F were possible over the weekend in some parts of the US, warning that even in big metropolitan areas such as Des Moines, Iowa, frostbite could become a significant danger. Ahead of one of the busiest travel periods of the year, the American Automobile Association (AAA) said more than 112 million people planned to travel 50 miles (80 km) or more from home between 23 December and 2 January. Even though fleets of snow plows and salt trucks have been deployed across the US, driving was extremely dangerous and even deadly. Kansas City police spokesperson Donna Drake said a minivan driver died Thursday after losing control on icy streets and overturning into a creek. In Kentucky three people died on the roads, Governor Andy Beshear announced on Friday morning. Beshear added that the state’s National Guard was delivering blankets to the Kentucky state police to distribute to stranded drivers on Interstate 71 and escorting some to shelters. New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul , declared an emergency, saying the threat of flooding and ice jams blocking rivers would “wreak a lot of havoc in our community”. The Ohio governor, Mike DeWine, called it “a unique and dangerous situation”. In Georgia, where temperatures in the north were forecast to hit 10F (-12C), with subzero wind chills, the governor Brian Kemp said the state was “expecting weather we haven’t seen in a decade or more”. More than half of the so-called lower 48 states, from Washington state to Florida, are under winter weather alerts, including wind chill advisories affecting about 135 million people, said Ashton Robinson Cook of the weather service’s prediction centre. The NWS has described the storm as “once in a generation” weather event, saying more than 100 daily cold temperature records could be equalled or broken over the coming days. Florida is projected to experience its coldest Christmas in 30 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/apr/16/the-observer-view-on-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-16T05:31:01Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on North Korea: only China can put a stop to Kim Jong-un’s latest round of nuclear sabre-rattling | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/16/the-observer-view-on-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/16/the-observer-view-on-north-korea","fields":{"bodyText":"North Korea’s scary test launch of a newly developed, solid-fuel, nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile caused a brief panic on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido last week. It also added a note of urgency to today’s meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Japan’s hot-spring resort of Karuizawa, where the Pyongyang regime’s escalating threats will be high on the agenda. Even so, the key to the North Korea conundrum may lie hundreds of miles away, in Beijing. Two questions will dominate G7 deliberations. Why is Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s dictator, deliberately ratcheting up tensions with South Korea, Japan and the US, their ultimate protector? And what can the allies do in response? Hailing the launch, the latest in more than 100 tests since last year, Kim gave an insight into his paranoid thinking. The new missile would “reinforce our nuclear counter-attack” and induce “the enemy to give up its idle strategy”, he said. Until then, he promised only “endless fear”. North Korea repeatedly condemns joint US and South Korean military exercises, which it depicts as preparation for invasion. Inter-Korean dialogue has broken down since the election last year of South Korea’s conservative president, Yoon Suk-yeol. A bungled attempt at rapprochement by former US president Donald Trump came to nothing. Meanwhile, Yoon revealed recently that Washington and Seoul were stepping up nuclear war planning. Whether Kim feels genuinely threatened – North and South Korea are still technically in a state of war – or is exploiting fear of attack to better control North Korea’s people is a moot point. Yet he has many other reasons to feel insecure. His brutal regime, founded in 1948 by his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, lacks legitimacy at home and is isolated abroad. Punitive UN sanctions have stunted development. Desperation to have them lifted may be driving Kim’s aggressive actions. Recent reports that North Korea is again facing famine conditions point to hidden weakness. In January, the US-based monitoring project, 38 North, said food insecurity was at its worst since the Arduous March famines in the 1990s, which killed an estimated one million people. It is also unclear how badly the country has been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, though the toll is probably far worse than officially admitted. While such matters are shrouded in secrecy, it is also suggested that Kim, whose health is often questioned, is grappling with an in-house succession crisis. Speculation surrounds the recent public appearances of his previously unseen daughter, Kim Ju-ae, who is thought to be about 10. How her suddenly elevated status sits with her auntie, Kim’s high-flying, tough-talking younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, is anyone’s guess. To his other problems, it seems, beleaguered Kim must add trouble at home. What can G7 ministers do to curb North Korean bellicosity? Not much, probably. Additional, unilateral sanctions by individual states may be the only option, since China, backed by Russia, has blocked tougher, collective action by the UN security council. And it is to China that the world should now look to apply effective pressure. Kim is no puppet, but he is uniquely beholden to Beijing. Unchecked nuclear proliferation – and nuclear war – are not in China’s interest. President Xi Jinping wants to place China at the helm of a new world order. He recently brokered a “peace deal” between long-time foes, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Yet here is another entrenched problem, much closer to home. If Xi is serious about global leadership, he should demonstrate it by ending the standoff on the Korean peninsula."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2022/nov/03/north-korea-nuclear-attack-us-kim-regime-lloyd-austin","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-03T18:40:25Z","webTitle":"Nuclear attack on US or allies would end Kim regime, says defense secretary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/03/north-korea-nuclear-attack-us-kim-regime-lloyd-austin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/nov/03/north-korea-nuclear-attack-us-kim-regime-lloyd-austin","fields":{"bodyText":"The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said on Thursday any nuclear attack on the US or its allies by North Korea would “result in the end of the Kim regime”. Kim Jong-un’s government in Pyongyang has in recent days mounted a number of missile tests. The South Korean military said a test of an intercontinental ballistic missile on Thursday may have ended in failure. Japan called the launch “outrageous and absolutely intolerable”. According to a joint communique released by the US Department of Defense, during his meeting with the South Korean defense minister, Lee Jong-sup, Austin said: “Any nuclear attack against the United States or its allies and partners, including the use of non-strategic nuclear weapons, is unacceptable and will result in the end of the Kim regime.” Similar language was included in the US National Defense Strategy, which was released last week. That document said, in part: “Our strategy for North Korea recognises the threat posed by its nuclear, chemical, missile and conventional capabilities, and in particular the need to make clear to the Kim regime the dire consequences should it use nuclear weapons … there is no scenario in which the Kim regime could employ nuclear weapons and survive.” Austin, a retired US army general and the first African American secretary of defense, spoke to reporters at the Pentagon alongside Lee. “Minister Lee and I had an outstanding discussion today,” Austin said. “We talked about how the DPRK [North Korea] has continued provocations and destabilising actions, and at this time of heightened tension, our alliance is ironclad. “The United States remains fully committed to the defense [of South Korea]. Our extended deterrence commitment is firm and includes a full range of our nuclear and conventional and missile defense capabilities.” He said the two countries planned to return to large-scale military exercises on the peninsula. The Biden administration has taken such steps after four years in which Donald Trump placed unprecedented stress on relations between Seoul and Washington, saying he wanted South Korea to pay for US military assistance in place since the Korean war of 1950-53. Trump, whose cavalier treatment of matters of nuclear policy has been extensively reported, met repeatedly with Kim, staging high-profile summits that produced little tangible benefit. At the Pentagon, Austin said the US was “committed to building on on [the Biden administration’s] efforts to strengthen integrated deterrence and to ensure that this alliance continues to bolster security and stability on the Korean peninsula and throughout the Indo-Pacific”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/aug/30/wanted-a-new-energy-contract-for-renewables-and-nuclear-projects","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-30T19:25:58Z","webTitle":"Wanted: a new energy contract for renewables and nuclear projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/aug/30/wanted-a-new-energy-contract-for-renewables-and-nuclear-projects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/aug/30/wanted-a-new-energy-contract-for-renewables-and-nuclear-projects","fields":{"bodyText":"Rishi Sunak, when he was still chancellor and was coming round to the idea of a windfall tax, noticed a key point about today’s energy market. Not all the corporate winners in the UK from soaraway wholesale gas prices are producing hydrocarbons in the North Sea. Some are generating power from nuclear power stations, solar projects, windfarms and biomass and are enjoying the same high wholesale prices. Those generators are benefiting from old-style contracts based on “renewables obligation certificates” (ROCs) and suchlike, rather than contracts-for-difference (CfD) arrangements that have been the main way of incentivising capacity in recent years. Under CfDs, excess revenues over the agreed “strike” price flow to the Treasury. That is not the case with ROCs, thus some spectacular improvements in corporate fortunes; the share price of biomass-heavy Drax is up two-thirds in the past 12 months, for instance. In the event, Sunak confined his “energy profits levy” to oil and gas producers. It seems the Treasury was deterred by the complexities in the generation market, which was understandable up to a point. Much of the power is sold under long-term contracts, rather than at “spot” prices, and intermediaries sub-divide output many times. It is hard to get a firm grasp on where, precisely, windfall gains arise. Here, though, is a proposal that cuts through some of the complexity. Encourage those generators with juicy old-style contracts to enter an auction to switch themselves on to CfD arrangements, suggests the consultancy Cornwall Insight. If they all did so, and if the price of power came out at £162 per megawatt hour – still high by historical standards but a lot less than the current month-ahead price of £435 – the resulting savings could be enormous. About £44.4bn over six months, it calculates (and the UK Energy Research Centre has been pushing the idea for months). By way of incentive to companies to sign up, Cornwall says the new contracts could extend beyond the span of the old ones. In effect, the generators would get more certainty (and still a very nice price) over revenues in two or three years’ time in exchange for selling at sub-market lower prices today. Arm-twisting would also be in order, one could add: current returns are way beyond the original financiers’ wildest dreams. At one level, Cornwall’s proposed reform is a technical tweak, but it gets to the heart of an infuriating aspect of the current electricity market set-up: the fact that wholesale gas prices dictate all power prices, thereby creating today’s bonanza profits for some renewable and nuclear projects whose fixed costs have barely changed. Sunak had a crack at the problem and didn’t get far. If the potential gain over the winter could really be £44.4bn, ministers should take another look urgently. Letting HBOS bosses off hook a second time was a cop out Last Friday may already feel like ancient history but let’s not forget the financial regulators’ timid verdict on events from much longer ago. The Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority told us at the end of last week that their six-year investigation result in no sanction being imposed on the banking bosses who steered HBOS on to the rocks in 2008. Younger readers may need to be reminded that the catastrophe at HBOS was as bad as the one at the Royal Bank of Scotland. HBOS was meant to have a simple business model – one that didn’t rely on the racy world of investment banking – but managed to wreck itself via old-fashioned reckless lending. The bank was bailed out with £20bn of public money as it was shoved into the arms of its foolish rescuer, Lloyds TSB. The formal investigation in 2015 was scathing about dim-witted regulators at the old Financial Services Authority, but was clear on this point: “Ultimate responsibility for the failure of HBOS rests with its board.” That was why the PRA and the FCA were prodded by the Treasury select committee into re-examining the decision not to look at sanctions against senior HBOS managers – assumed to mean the two HBOS chief executives of the era, James Crosby and Andy Hornby, plus a handful of others. Now, for the second time, the result is “no further action”. It is unsatisfactory, to put it mildly. Yes, the rules around personal “culpability” were different in the old days. And, yes, Crosby and Hornby become unemployable for practical purposes in senior roles within the financial services industry (the latter these days is chief executive at the owner of Wagamama). But, come on, blaming the board as a collective while sparing individuals from censure is a cop-out. Public faith in the regulatory system has just fallen another notch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/jan/21/tv-tonight-chuck-ds-fantastic-series-about-the-world-changing-power-of-hip-hop","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-21T06:00:18Z","webTitle":"TV tonight: Chuck D’s fantastic series about the world-changing power of hip hop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/21/tv-tonight-chuck-ds-fantastic-series-about-the-world-changing-power-of-hip-hop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/21/tv-tonight-chuck-ds-fantastic-series-about-the-world-changing-power-of-hip-hop","fields":{"bodyText":"Fight the Power: How Hip Hop Changed the World Saturday, 9pm, BBC Two Public Enemy’s Chuck D leads this fantastic four-part documentary telling the history of hip-hop.

Turner was taking pictures of passersby and Ivan stopped to ask him about them. Something about Ivan intrigued Turner. “He gave the impression of being homeless,” he suggests, “but also he clearly looked after himself.” Turner took Ivan’s picture and over the year or two that followed the pair would see each other quite often. Turner got to fill in some of Ivan’s story: he lived alone – dividing his time between a flat outside town and in a caravan on a scrap of land he had bought – and suffered from a form of psychosis that meant he was plagued by voices in his head. But he was also relentlessly positive, a friendly face to many in the town. At the beginning of lockdown, Turner’s marriage had just broken down and he found himself visiting and photographing Ivan more often. “I realised what I was doing in my portraits of Ivan was channelling memories of the vulnerabilities of my own difficult childhood into Ivan’s life as a vulnerable adult,” Turner says. The set-ups of the photographs and captions started to merge their histories – particularly their shared issues with religion – to ask questions about mental health and human connection. Turner calls his pictures “The Divided Self”. He half-imagines the series might go on until both he and Ivan “are pensioners sitting on a bench somewhere”. “Place is important to Ivan,” Turner says. “The picture with Foggy [the sheep] is typical. When he got his caravan he bought four sheep to live on the land. When he was away he asked some neighbouring travellers to look after the sheep on the understanding that they would keep them away from the ram. They clearly failed. There are now about 12 sheep on Ivan’s land.” The picture comes with a quote from the book of Isaiah: “He tends his flock like a shepherd: He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart.” See more of Greg Turner’s photography on his website"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/dec/19/cricket-pakistan-england-third-test-day-three-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-19T13:04:37Z","webTitle":"Rehan Ahmed makes history as England power towards clean sweep in Pakistan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/19/cricket-pakistan-england-third-test-day-three-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/dec/19/cricket-pakistan-england-third-test-day-three-report","fields":{"bodyText":"On a tour of Pakistan that has thrown up an abundance of magical moments for England’s rejuvenated Test team, it may well be that the sight of Rehan Ahmed dropping to the dusty soil of Karachi to offer a prayer of thanks topped the lot. Aged 18 years and 128 days, Ahmed had just broken the record held by Australia’s Pat Cummins as the youngest men’s Test cricketer to claim a five-wicket haul on debut. Better still, 48 hours on from hailing the best day of his life, he had set his team on course for what would be a first series clean sweep in Pakistan. Ahmed’s magical figures of five for 48 from 14.5 overs – secured aged 68 days younger than Cummins’s stunning arrival in Johannesburg 11 years ago – led to Pakistan being rolled for 216 all out, setting England a target of 167 in seven sessions. The tourists wanted it done in one, raiding a frankly bewildering 112 for two from 17 overs in the gloaming, leaving only 55 more to whittle off on day four. Amid this bid for glory before sunset Ahmed even emerged as the first official “nighthawk” of the new era at No 3 – apologies, Stuart Broad – and carted his first ball off Abrar Ahmed down the ground for four. A second, wristier boundary followed before he was bowled for 10. No matter. Through Zak Crawley’s run-a-ball 41 and Ben Duckett’s unbeaten 38-ball 50, history was within touching distance. As Ahmed scribbled his numbers in gold pen on the honours board after stumps, scarcely able to compute them as he did so, it was another example of the Midas touch that has prevailed since Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum became captain and head coach respectively. A talent such as Ahmed, performing the hardest job in cricket, could scarcely have wished for two better leaders under whom to start. Despite two wickets on day one Stokes held Ahmed back until well into the afternoon. A three-wicket burst from Jack Leach first thing had made way for nearly three hours of steadfast resistance from Saud Shakeel and Babar Azam and at 164 for three – a lead of 114 runs – Pakistan were looking ominous. Stokes tried to barge through the door with an eight-over spell of heft in the heat and grew agitated with it, his shy at the stumps allowing Babar to bring up a typically glossy half-century via overthrows. But in the space of 17 deliveries Ahmed picked the lock instead, prising out both set men, plus Mohammad Rizwan, to make it 177 for six and expose Pakistan’s rather brittle lower order. Babar’s demise during Ahmed’s second over was galling for a captain surely hearing the whispers about his future, rocking back and slapping a long-hop to Ollie Pope at midwicket on 54. But there was little doubt about the quality of the follow-up, Ahmed finding the edge of Rizwan’s defensive push on seven with a dipping, downright purring leg-break that Ben Foakes neatly pouched. The googly is Ahmed’s most potent weapon through its greater bounce and once the latest of these had removed Shakeel for 53 via a top-edged sweep, the hosts had that sinking feeling once more. Joe Root soon had the largely anonymous Faheem Ashraf caught at slip after tea off a loose drive, while Mark Wood simply beat Nauman Ali for pace to end a gutsier 15 lbw. All that was left was for Ahmed to shut down the innings, Mohammad Wasim Jr undone slogging another wrong’un and Agha Salman sweeping to short fine leg. With his Pakistan-born father, Naeem, welling up in the stands, Ahmed’s immediate sajdah in celebration was truly special. Not for the first time Leach had seen the headlines pilfered by the young debutant and yet his contribution – figures of three for 72 from 26 overs – was hugely significant. Leach had set things in motion in the morning, claiming the first of three victims in six balls when Shan Masood attempted a reverse sweep on 24 and under-edged on to leg stump. Out strode Azhar Ali for his final Test innings before retirement. The 37-year-old is a player whose service to Pakistan has been immense, not just through 7,000-plus Test runs and 19 centuries but as one of the central pillars of the team that spent 10 years in exile yet rose to No 1 in the rankings in 2016. What followed, however, with his wife and children watching on in the sparse stands, was heartbreaking. Attempting to dance down to Leach’s fourth ball, Azhar instead yorked himself as a dipping delivery broke back on to the stumps. As England offered handshakes, and teammates formed a guard of honour at the boundary’s edge, Azhar wiped a tear from his eye. Bowled for a duck was no way to sign off, even if consolation could perhaps be found through Don Bradman’s famous exit stage left. In the next over Leach struck again, Abdullah Shafique out lbw in identical fashion to the first innings to leave the hosts 54 for three – a lead of just four. But though Shakeel survived the hat-trick ball amid a cage of vultures, and formed one half of a battling 110-run fightback alongside Babar, there was simply no escaping the sense of destiny that appears to be following Ahmed and this England team."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2023/jan/12/danny-beales-interview-labour-candidate-boris-johnson-seat-uxbridge-and-south-ruislip","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-12T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"A bellwether seat? Labour candidate sees beating Boris Johnson as key to power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/12/danny-beales-interview-labour-candidate-boris-johnson-seat-uxbridge-and-south-ruislip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/jan/12/danny-beales-interview-labour-candidate-boris-johnson-seat-uxbridge-and-south-ruislip","fields":{"bodyText":"Labour’s candidate to take on Boris Johnson as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip says the party may have to win the seat for the first time to gain power at the next election. Danny Beales, 34, a councillor and charity worker who grew up in the area, admits he will have to work “exceptionally hard” to overturn Johnson’s 7,210 majority. Since being selected as candidate for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Beales is convinced Labour can gain from local exasperation at the checkered record of the former prime minister. “I think it will be a bellwether seat – it is exactly the sort of seat Labour needs to win to deliver a Labour government. The issues in Uxbridge and South Ruislip are also the key issues nationally – on the doorstep people say they feel poorer.” Labour’s hopes of toppling the then prime minister at the 2019 general election proved wildly overoptimistic, as Johnson increased his majority by more than 2,000 votes in an outer London constituency that has been Tory since it was formed in 2010. But according to analysis in the New Statesman by the co-founder of the polling group Britain Elects, the seat is now winnable for Labour. Beales says: “I always take polls with a pinch of salt, but it’s good motivation for activists to feel we should really be going for the win.” At 34, he is too young to remember much about Labour’s landslide victory in the 1997 general election, but says his family and friends talk about the “Michael Portillo moment” when the then defence secretary lost to Labour’s Stephen Twigg in another outer London constituency, Enfield Southgate. “Potentially, there could be a ‘Boris Johnson moment’,” says Beales, “but my interest in standing isn’t about headlines, it’s because I think the area deserves a Labour MP and we desperately need a Labour government.” But he will also be targeting Johnson personally. “People deserve a full-time MP, I’ve heard so many times from people of all political persuasions that they don’t get a response from Boris’s office, and that he only turns up once a year.” Beales, who is Camden council’s regeneration chief, says: “The basic job of being a representative, is that you’re available, accessible, and responsive.” As the son of a single mother, Beales taunted his future opponent in his selection victory speech, reminding the audience that Johnson once dismissed children of single parents as “ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate”. It was a proud moment for his watching mother, says Beales, adding: “I couldn’t be more proud of my upbringing. It’s people like my mum and grandparents that make places like Uxbridge and South Ruislip, not people like Boris Johnson.” The selection of Beales, who is regarded as a Keir Starmer loyalist and once backed Liz Kendall as party leader, was criticised by some on the left as a stitch-up. The local selection panel was disbanded on a seemingly flimsy pretext and the process passed to Labour London, the regional party that overwhelmingly backed Beales. Asked why the panel was disbanded, Beales began to answer by saying: “I am not aware.” He was then interrupted by his smart watch, which in a computerised voice said: “I don’t know what you mean by ‘I am not aware’.” Seemingly corrected, Beales says: “I am aware that the selection committee was disbanded, I’ve never been told exactly why.” Unruffled, he adds: “Members were given a vote. I don’t know how much of a stitch-up that can be.” Beales describes himself as a “pragmatic socialist”, and says he is keen to focus away from internal Labour politics and towards the community he needs to win over. As a child he was made homeless in Uxbridge when his mother lost her job. He says the experience gave him an insight into the cost of living pressures facing voters now. Beales is head of policy and campaigns at the National Aids Trust and a proud member of the LGBT community. He expects his political opponents will try to use his sexuality to try to gain support in a socially conservative area. “Maybe the Conservatives will use it to distract from their failings in office and the failing of the incumbent to be a decent full-time MP,” says Beales. “But knocking on doors, I know people like my grandparents are worried about the cost of heating and housing. They’re worried about the ability of their kids to stay in the borough to get jobs to be afford the weekly shop. They’re not worried about LGBT people.” His grandparents, like 56% of people in the area, voted to leave the EU and have voted Conservative in the past. They moved out of the area recently but said they would vote for him if they could. Beales now needs to convince thousands of other former Tory voters. “It’s potentially going to be a two-year-long hard slog of a campaign. The challenge is turn frustration and desire for change into a positive choice for Labour,” he says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/18/un-chief-presidents-zelenskiy-erdogan-talks-ukraine-grain-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T19:07:20Z","webTitle":"Russia to stage ‘provocation’ at nuclear plant, warns Ukrainian military","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/un-chief-presidents-zelenskiy-erdogan-talks-ukraine-grain-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/18/un-chief-presidents-zelenskiy-erdogan-talks-ukraine-grain-nuclear-plant","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine’s military intelligence has warned that Russian forces may be preparing to stage a “provocation” at a nuclear power plant they control, as the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces and equipment from the site. Guterres, on his second visit to Ukraine since the Russian invasion, joined the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, for meetings and then a press conference in the western city of Lviv. “We are worried. We don’t want another Chernobyl,” Erdoğan said. It was the first visit to Ukraine by Turkey’s leader, who has been a key intermediary in negotiations with Russia. Zelenskiy said he agreed with Guterres on a framework for a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog to inspect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. It was taken over by Russian forces in March but is still being run by Ukrainians. The UN chief called on Russian forces to leave with their military equipment, amid fears that fighting around the site could lead to a deadly disaster. Moscow and Kyiv have traded accusations of shelling the site. “The facility must not be used as part of any military operation. Instead, agreement is urgently needed to re-establish Zaporizhzhia’s purely civilian infrastructure and to ensure the safety of the area,” Guterres said. Video footage shared online by a New York Times reporter showed at least five apparently military trucks parked inside the plant’s engine room near the turbo generator. In the hours before the international summit in western Ukraine, Russia announced it had deployed warplanes armed with hypersonic missiles to its Kaliningrad region, an enclave on the Baltic Sea that borders the EU and Nato members Poland and Lithuania. The commander of its Black Sea fleet has also been replaced, the Russian RIA news agency said, in one of the most high-profile military sackings since the invasion. It came after a series of humiliations for the fleet, including the sinking of its flagship Moskva cruiser and an attack on a key airbase in Crimea. Inside Ukraine, Russian forces stepped up attacks on Kharkiv, the country’s second largest city, ahead of the summit in Lviv. In attacks overnight and early on Thursday morning, at least 11 people were killed and more than 40 injured and a residential block was destroyed. Ukraine’s defence intelligence agency said it was concerned that Russia had plans to stage an incident at the plant on Friday, and had information that staff with Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company had left the site. Russian state media had already accused Ukraine of planning a “provocation” at the plant to coincide with the UN leader’s trip, raising fears that Russia’s military could be planning a “false-flag attack”. When Guterres travelled to Kyiv in April, Moscow carried out an airstrike on the city. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, said Ukraine must “prepare for all scenarios”, during a drill for emergency workers in Zaporizhzhia. On Wednesday, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, warned Russia’s seizure of the plant had “raised the risk of a nuclear accident or incident” and accused Moscow of being “reckless” by using the area as a staging platform to launch artillery attacks on Ukrainian forces. Russia said it may shut down the plant, claiming backup support systems had been damaged in strikes. Igor Kirillov, the head of the radioactive, chemical and biological defence force, said if there was an accident at the site, radioactive material would cover Poland, Germany and Slovenia. Ukraine’s hydrometeorological institute also warned of contamination spreading across Europe, a BBC journalist reported. Two issues are causing deepening anxiety about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant. International nuclear safety officials have become concerned over the lack of spare parts, access for routine maintenance of the reactors, and contact with staff, all of which have been disrupted by the conflict. A second issue is shelling around the plant. According to Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear authority, the impacts from Grad missiles earlier this month were close to the spent fuel storage area, with the plant’s operator claiming Russian troops “aimed specifically” at the containers, despite the Russian military’s presence at the site. Russia accuses Ukraine of carrying out the shelling. On Friday, Guterres will travel to the Black Sea port of Odesa, a crucial gateway for Ukrainian grain to reach the rest of the world. He will then continue to Turkey to visit the Joint Coordination Centre, the body tasked with overseeing the accord. Ukraine’s fields feed hundreds of millions of people worldwide, so the abrupt halt to shipments has pushed up global grain prices at a time when famine is already threatening east Africa. The UN last month brokered an agreement to let shipments restart. So far, 24 ships have left Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, a monitoring group said. Kyiv has a backlog of 18m tonnes of grain from last year’s harvest, even as it starts bringing in the 2022 crop. It hopes to soon raise exports to 3m tonnes a month, easing world prices and clearing storage space for new grain. It will be six months on 24 August since the start of the invasion – which Russia calls a “special military operation” – and several UN security council members, including the US, Britain, the Republic of Ireland and Norway, have called for a meeting on that date. Kyiv is expected to launch a counteroffensive in southern Ukraine in the coming weeks and has carried out spectacular attacks deep inside Russian-held territory, including on an airbase in Crimea. But despite shipments of western weapons and ammunition, Ukraine is still struggling against heavy Russian artillery bombardment along the eastern front. The Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said in a video on Wednesday that the war had reached a “strategic deadlock”. “Russian forces have achieved only minimal advances, and in some cases we have advanced, since last month,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2022/oct/23/power-cycle-could-tracking-periods-help-female-athletes-break-records","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-23T08:00:32Z","webTitle":"Power cycle: could tracking periods help female athletes break records?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/oct/23/power-cycle-could-tracking-periods-help-female-athletes-break-records","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/oct/23/power-cycle-could-tracking-periods-help-female-athletes-break-records","fields":{"bodyText":"It should have been a show of British sporting dominance when Dina Asher-Smith and Daryll Neita made it to the 100-metre final of the European Championships in August. Then, unexpectedly, Asher-Smith pulled up and Neita was not quick enough for the gold, both because of cramps. Later, Asher-Smith revealed hers to be a symptom of her period and shared her frustration at its impact on her sport. If it were a men’s issue, she argued, it would have been fixed by now. It is a feeling shared by many fellow athletes and coaches, including Chelsea FC’s manager, Emma Hayes. “Once a month for potentially up to around five days, many female players have an event that can cause significant distress and impact heavily on their performance,” she wrote in the Telegraph earlier this year. “Athletes deserve a greater understanding of the array of symptoms that can crop up.” That demand is increasingly being heard. Sports science companies have begun offering consultancy packages to help athletes “work proactively” with their cycles to stay on top, and their approach has already found disciples: the coach of the US women’s football team partly attributes their 2019 World Cup win to it. Sports institutes in several European countries have also started projects to equip their athletes with similar strategies ahead of the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. But even if periods are given more attention in sport, what can anyone actually offer athletes struggling with their periods? In a field still full of unknowns, some researchers believe that understanding the menstrual cycle will not just free athletes from symptoms, but take them to new, record-breaking heights. *** For an athlete with bad period symptoms, the menstrual cycle’s fluctuating hormones and monthly bleeding are not just a fleeting annoyance. As the Chinese swimmer Fu Yuanhui found at the 2016 Rio Olympics when she failed to make the podium because of period fatigue, it can be the difference between winning a medal and going home empty-handed. Considering such high stakes and the fact that women’s participation in elite sport has soared – the Olympics included only 20% women in 1976 but reached gender parity for the first time at Tokyo 2020 – it is no surprise that the demand for solutions to period problems in sport has increased accordingly. At the same time, it is “absolutely true” that research is lacking, says Kathryn Ackerman, a sports medicine physician and endocrinologist at Boston Children’s Hospital in Massachusetts. “This is something that I and my international colleagues who study women’s health and female athletes have been saying for a long time.” Women only make up 39% of participants in sports science studies, according to a study in 2014. Kirsty Elliott-Sale, professor of female endocrinology and exercise physiology at Manchester Metropolitan University, says there is research but often “it is not high-quality”. This has resulted in trends with only patchy evidence taking off, such as training or eating according to a prediction of what phase of their cycle the athlete is in. “[Speaking as] somebody who’s been researching the field for 25 years,” says Elliott-Sale, “there isn’t research evidence to support that.” But in the world of elite sport, some argue that bulletproof evidence matters less than in academia. Jessica Piasecki, a researcher of female physiology at Nottingham Trent University and the fastest female British marathon runner bar Paula Radcliffe, says that athletes want to find what works for them, not necessarily what produces a statistically significant result. “If they perceptually feel that their performance is better, then that’s great,” she says. There is a long history of doing things within elite sport that is not fully scientifically evidenced. Ice baths as a recovery technique, for example, are controversial, she says, “but loads of athletes use it because it makes their legs feel better.” One popular intervention is anti-inflammatory food. During the menstrual cycle, inflammation in the body increases at different points, and since some studies have linked such inflammation to unwelcome symptoms, the logic goes that athletes can counter their symptoms by consuming foods thought to reduce inflammation, such as turmeric, tart cherry juice and ginger, at the right time. The sports science company Orreco subscribes to this idea. Orreco has its athlete clients track their periods and symptoms with an app, and then it uses the data to formulate advice on nutrition, says one of its sports and exercise physiologists, Esther Goldsmith. According to her, this approach has helped many athletes, including players from the England women’s football team. “One of their players was really, really suffering,” she says. “We basically threw the kitchen sink at her.” Six months after implementing changes to her nutrition and lifestyle, the player’s symptoms were apparently gone. Goldsmith appreciates that the evidence is “limited and sometimes contradictory”. For example, in 2016, a review concluded that while there is some evidence that ginger can lessen period pain, it also highlighted that studies on the topic were few, small and often imperfect. But, she says, “we can’t just sit back and say, ‘No sorry, we can’t intervene because the research isn’t there.’” *** Faced with navigating such a complicated maze to deal with periods, some opt for hormonal birth control. On the pill, bleeding can be avoided altogether by skipping the usual break, and even without skipping it, the monthly bleeding will not be an actual period because the pill has blocked ovulation. This means that while athletes are on hormonal birth control, they will not have periods. That can be problematic, says Nicky Keay, a sports endocrinologist and physician. Birth control “is every woman’s choice”, she says, but in her forthcoming book, Hormones, Health and Human Potential, she details how hormonal contraception can mask the sudden loss of periods, a strong indication of the condition known as relative energy deficiency in sport (Red-S), the result of training too much and eating too little. As a driven athlete, the balance is easy to get wrong. Pippa Woolven, a recently retired runner for Great Britain, says she developed Red-S when she got a sport scholarship to the US and was keen to progress. “I increased my training load and started to experience more and more pressures surrounding body image, diet, nutrition,” she says. This did translate to quicker run times until things went awry. She felt ill and fatigued most of the time. “It became quite difficult to function as a human being, let alone an athlete.” Because she was on the pill for contraceptive reasons, she did not realise that she had stopped getting her period. The danger with Red-S is that it can affect long-term bone health, says Ackerman. When the body has an energy deficit and the menstrual cycle is suppressed, it disrupts oestrogen, which is important for maintaining bones. If athletes get Red-S in their early youth when they should be building bone density, “they’ll be at much higher risk of stress fractures, low bone density and osteoporosis,” says Ackerman. The same is true for boys and men. Their testosterone levels might fall, and as testosterone is converted to oestrogen in the body, their bone health also suffers. And like periods, Red-S symptoms for men can also feel too intimate to discuss openly. “One of the signs of Red-S in a male athlete is that they have decreased libido and they don’t get normal morning erections,” Ackerman says. “We need to normalise it and not sexualise it, but just talk about these things as signs.” It was only when Woolven got in touch with Keay that she found her way to recovery. Now, she heads up the charity Project Red-S to spread awareness. Understanding that periods are markers of health that athletes should monitor before they do permanent damage to themselves is critical, she says. In a way, it is similar to concussions in rugby. Athletes enter the sport without knowing the full extent of the risk to their health, she says. *** There are some who believe the menstrual cycle could be even more than a health marker. Ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics, France’s National Institute of Sport, Expertise, and Performance (Insep) has taken an interest in the possibility that working in sync with the menstrual cycle’s hormone fluctuations could lead to gains in performance – and more medals. “We are approaching human limits of performance,” says Juliana Antero, who is heading up the Insep project Empowe’her (Exploring Menstrual Periods of Women Athletes to Escalate Ranking). In 2015, she was involved in a study that examined 3,263 world records across disciplines such as the 400-metre sprint and the triple jump, and found a consistent decrease in both the frequency and degree of improvement in new world records since the 1990s. The data revealed occasional step changes, such as the 2008 to 2009 introduction of polyurethane swimsuits, and Antero believes that understanding the menstrual cycle could provide another bump. There could be a perfect hormone level for breaking world records. And it is easy to see how, as new hormone-testing technology becomes available, athletes might better understand relationships between their hormones and their performance, and plan accordingly. The English Institute of Sport is trialling hormone saliva tests in collaboration with the company Mint Diagnostics, hoping to provide track-side results in minutes, for symptom treatment and, down the line, for performance gains. Elliott-Sale is intrigued by this idea, but remains sceptical. “I do think [tracking and managing symptoms] will make a difference for some sportswomen,” she says. If Asher-Smith’s calf cramp could have been avoided, she might have had a go at gold. But for athletes who are not greatly affected already, she believes the potential gains will be marginal. “I don’t personally think it is going to change the face of women’s sport.” She says we have to remember that many sportswomen manage perfectly well or might not even have cycles. “If I was that elite sportswoman who was underachieving because of my cycle, I’d be screaming from the rooftop ‘help me, help me’.” But, she says, “will it change a whole team, a whole squad, a nation, all sportswomen? Probably not.” Antero’s work shows that we currently know of few consistent effects of the menstrual cycle on performance, but she believes this will soon change. The menstrual cycle is incredibly individual and because the hormone levels are not consistent for each participant, trials struggle to pick anything up. But if we track the cycle of the individual, we could untangle how it affects them both negatively and positively, says Antero. “I believe we can enhance female-athlete performance.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/10/project-to-build-navy-frigates-in-adelaide-faces-significant-cost-blowouts-report-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-10T07:09:53Z","webTitle":"Project to build navy frigates in Adelaide faces ‘significant’ cost blowouts, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/10/project-to-build-navy-frigates-in-adelaide-faces-significant-cost-blowouts-report-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/10/project-to-build-navy-frigates-in-adelaide-faces-significant-cost-blowouts-report-says","fields":{"bodyText":"A $45bn naval shipbuilding project faces “significant” cost blowouts after defence officials failed to properly consider “value for money”, according to a new audit report. Wednesday’s report criticises the initial stages of the program to build nine new Hunter-class frigates for the Royal Australian Navy – a process that occurred during the former Coalition government’s time in office. The report’s release coincided with the Labor government introducing new legislation to pave the way for another complex and expensive shipbuilding project: acquiring nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus pact. The Australian National Audit Office (Anao) found that the Department of Defence’s management of the Hunter class procurement had been only “partly effective”. “Defence’s procurement process and related advisory processes lacked a value for money focus, and key records, including the rationale for the procurement approach, were not retained,” the report tabled in parliament said. “Contract expenditure to date has not been effective in delivering on project milestones, and the project is experiencing an 18-month delay and additional costs due in large part to design immaturity.” The report said the design issues had driven up the cost to Defence by $423m so far. But it added: “At January 2023 the project was forecast to exceed the whole of project budget approved by government by a significant amount.” The Turnbull government announced in June 2018 that the Hunter class frigates would be designed by the British company BAE Systems and built at the Osborne shipyard in Adelaide. The then government said it had made the decision after “a rigorous and comprehensive competitive evaluation process” that had also considered options from Italy’s Fincantieri and Spain’s Navantia. But the Anao found the advice provided to the government was “not complete”, because Defence had failed to make clear that a value-for-money assessment had not been conducted. Defence recommended the BAE option “based primarily on anti-submarine warfare capability”, but some documents surrounding the process were not retained, the report said. The contract management plan was established only three and a half years after the contract was executed. Responding to the Anao report, the Department of Defence agreed to two recommendations to improve its processes, but disputed the findings. “Defence demonstrably considered value for money throughout the procurement process,” the department said. But the defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, said the Anao report “demonstrates yet again the bungling and mismanagement of critical defence projects by the former Coalition government”. The Greens’ defence spokesperson, David Shoebridge, said the “scathing” report placed “even more question marks around the capacity of Defence to deliver” the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine project. A spokesperson for BAE Systems said: “The Hunter program continues to make strong progress and we have begun building the first schedule protection block – which will be used in the first ship. We remain committed to building nine anti-submarine warfare frigates for the Royal Australian Navy.” The Hunter class frigate program is under fresh scrutiny because the Albanese government has ordered a new review of the navy’s surface fleet needs. The retired US navy Vice-Admiral William Hilarides – who has long been a source of advice to successive Australian governments on naval matters – is one of three people appointed to conduct the review over the next few months. The others are the former Department of Finance secretary Rosemary Huxtable and retired Royal Australian Navy Vice-Admiral Stuart Mayer. They will consider whether any changes are needed to the navy’s surface fleet plans in light of the decision to acquire nuclear-powered submarines. On Wednesday the government introduced a bill to clarify that the existing ban on civil nuclear power in Australia does not prevent “conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines”. The submarine program is expected to cost between $268bn and $368bn over the period from now to the mid-2050s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/sep/21/first-thing-putin-threatens-nuclear-retaliation-in-escalation-of-ukraine-war","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-21T09:26:36Z","webTitle":"Putin threatens nuclear retaliation in escalation of Ukraine war | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/21/first-thing-putin-threatens-nuclear-retaliation-in-escalation-of-ukraine-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/sep/21/first-thing-putin-threatens-nuclear-retaliation-in-escalation-of-ukraine-war","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning. Vladimir Putin has announced a partial mobilisation in Russia in a significant escalation that places the country’s people and economy on a wartime footing. The president also threatened nuclear retaliation, saying Russia had “lots of weapons” to reply to what he called western threats on its territory and added that he was not bluffing. In a highly anticipated televised address, Putin said the “partial mobilisation” was a direct response to the dangers posed by the west that “wants to destroy our country” and claimed the west had tried to “turn Ukraine’s people into cannon fodder”. “Military service will apply only to citizens who are currently in the reserve, especially those who have served in the armed forces, have certain military professions and relevant experience,” he said. What has happened since? Shortly after Putin’s announcement, the country’s defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, said 300,000 Russians would be called up as part of the mobilisation, which would apply to “those with previous military experience”. What has sparked this? The Russian leader’s televised address to the country came a day after Russian-controlled regions in Ukraine announced plans to hold votes on becoming part of Russia. This could set the stage for Moscow to escalate the war after Ukrainian successes. Writer E Jean Carroll to file new lawsuit after accusing Trump of rape E Jean Carroll, the writer who accused Donald Trump of raping her more than two decades ago, plans to file a new lawsuit against the former US president. In a letter made public on Tuesday, a lawyer for former Elle magazine columnist said she planned to sue Trump for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress under New York state’s Adult Survivors Act. That law, recently signed by the governor, Kathy Hochul, gives adult accusers a one-year window to bring civil claims over alleged sexual misconduct regardless of how long ago it occurred. Trump has denied raping Carroll and accused her of concocting the claim to sell her book. Carroll’s lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, said her client planned to sue Trump on 24 November, when the state law would take effect, and that the claims and Carroll’s existing defamation case against Trump could be tried together in February 2023. What does Carroll say happened? Carroll has accused Trump of raping her in the dressing room of the Manhattan department store Bergdorf Goodman in the 1990s. She sued him in 2019 while he was serving his presidency, saying he slandered her by denying the allegation. What has Trump said about it? The former president said she was “totally lying” and was “not my type”, among other remarks. Revealed: the ‘shocking’ levels of toxic lead in Chicago tap water One in 20 tap water tests performed for thousands of Chicago residents found lead, a neurotoxin, at or above US government limits, according to a Guardian analysis of City of Chicago data. One-third had more lead than is permitted in bottled water. This means that of the 24,000 tests, approximately 1,000 homes had lead exceeding federal standards. Experts and locals say these results raise broader concerns because there are an estimated 400,000 lead pipes supplying water to homes in the city, and the vast majority were not tested as part of the program. Moreover, they say the city is not moving fast enough to eliminate the potential danger. The Guardian worked with the water engineer Elin Betanzo – who helped uncover the Flint water crisis that resulted in many, mostly Black residents being poisoned by lead in the Michigan city – to review the results of water tests conducted for Chicago residents between 2016 and 2021. Chicago authorities have not released an analysis of the results. What impact can lead have on people’s health? Once in the blood, lead can cross the blood-brain barrier and affect the nervous system. It has been linked to lower IQ levels, behavioral disorders and worsening performance in reading and math. In adults, low levels of lead are associated with kidney problems and increasing blood pressure, which can contribute to a host of cardiac effects. Minnesota schemers allegedly swindle $250m in largest pandemic fraud Forty-seven people have been charged in what US authorities say is the largest case yet of “pandemic fraud”, accusing the defendants of a “brazen” scheme to swindle millions from a program intended for low-income children and using it to “enrich themselves”. Those charged are accused of creating companies that claimed to providing food to tens of thousands of children across Minnesota, then sought reimbursement for those meals through the US Department of Agriculture’s food nutrition programs. Prosecutors say few meals were served, and the defendants used the money to buy luxury cars, property and jewelry. Authorities say a total of $250m was stolen from the federal program. “This $250m is the floor,” Andrew Luger, the US attorney for Minnesota, said at a news conference. How did they carry out the fraud? Luger said the government was billed for more than 125m fake meals, with some defendants making up names for children by using an online random name generator. Many of the companies that claimed to be serving food were sponsored by a non-profit called Feeding Our Future, which submitted the companies’ claims for reimbursement.

Compared with ants, that is a mediocre milestone. Researchers have made the most thorough assessment to date of the global population of ants and the estimated total is a mind-blowing 20 quadrillion of them, or approximately 2.5 million for every human. It should come as little surprise considering how ubiquitous these busy and social insects are, and the fact they have thrived since the age of dinosaurs, with the oldest-known ant fossil dating back about 100m years to the Cretaceous period. Don’t miss this: the true crime podcasts that changed their subjects’ lives On Monday, a Baltimore judge vacated the conviction of Adnan Syed, who spent 23 years behind bars for a crime he claims he did not commit. Eight years ago, the journalist Sarah Koenig made Syed the focus of her This American Life spinoff podcast Serial, in the process making Syed an unlikely celebrity and catapulting the world into what would be known as the “golden age of podcasting”. Serial was the first podcast to go mega-viral, reaching 1m downloads per episode just four weeks after its release. Here is a look at what Serial has wrought – the good, the bad, the shamelessly sensationalist – in the years since. … or this: California’s historic Little Arabia finally recognized Last month, after more than 20 years of community advocacy, the Anaheim city council formally designated a section of the city as Little Arabia, making it the first officially recognized Arab American enclave in the US.

But for many residents and businessowners, the designation means something deeper. “With the designation, you feel like you’re part of America, your community is represented,” said Nizar Milbes, a community activist. Climate check: UN chief calls for windfall tax on fossil fuel companies Countries should impose windfall taxes on fossil fuel companies and divert the money to vulnerable nations suffering worsening losses from the climate crisis, the UN secretary general has urged. António Guterres said “polluters must pay” for the escalating damage caused by heatwaves, floods and other climate impacts, adding that it was “high time to put fossil fuel producers, investors and enablers on notice”. Guterres’s appeal came in his most urgent, and bleakest, speech to date on the state of the planet. “Our world is in big trouble,” he said.

World leaders have called for the Zaporizhzhia site to be demilitarised after footage emerged of Russian army vehicles inside the plant, and have previously warned Russia against cutting it off from the Ukrainian grid and connecting it up to the Russian power network. But Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, told the Guardian in an interview that Russian engineers had already drawn up a blueprint for a switch on the grounds of emergency planning should fighting sever remaining power connections. “They presented [the plan] to [workers at] the plant, and the plant [workers] presented it to us. The precondition for this plan was heavy damage of all lines which connect Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Ukrainian system,” Kotin said in an interview on Ukraine’s independence day on Wednesday, with the country mostly locked down because of the threat of Russian attacks. He fears that Russia’s military is now targeting those connections to make the emergency scenario a reality. Both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the site. “They just started doing that, they starting all the shelling, just to take out these lines,” Kotin said. Other threats to nuclear security at the plant include vehicles packed so tightly into turbine halls that firefighters would struggle to access them if a fire broke out, and a campaign of terror against workers who have chosen to stay at the frontline plant. One was beaten to death, and another so severely injured that he needed three months to recover. More than 200 have been detained, Kotin said. The plant’s electricity connections are already in a critical situation, with three of the four main lines connecting it to Ukraine’s grid broken during the war, and two of the three back-up lines connecting it to a conventional power plant also down, he said. The Russian plan to disconnect it entirely would raise the risk of a catastrophic failure by leaving it dependent on a single source of electricity to cool the reactors. “You cannot just switch from one system to another immediately, you have to … shut down everything on one side, and then you start to switch on another side,” he said. During a shift between grid systems, the plant would be reliant only on a back-up diesel-powered generator, with no further options should that fail. After only 90 minutes without power the reactors would reach a dangerous temperature. “During this disconnection, the plant won’t be connected to any power supply and that is the reason for the danger,” he said. “If you fail to provide cooling … for one hour and a half, then you will have melting already.” Russia seized control of the Zaporizhzhia plant in March but it is still run by Ukrainian workers. There has been increasing alarm about Russian management of the site in recent weeks, and pressure on Moscow to allow UN inspectors to visit. Kotin said inspectors from the UN’s nuclear watchdog could be at the plant within one or two weeks to check on security, after progress in negotiations with Russia about a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Kotin is also concerned about the fire risk from vehicles packed into the turbine halls, which sit next to the two reactors still in operation. There are 14 trucks in one hall, and at least six in another, sources at the plant have told him. “In case there is a fire in the turbine hall you don’t even have a possibility to put it out or mitigate the consequences of this fire, because your fire brigades cannot get in, because any entry is blocked by the trucks, which are just packed in there,” he said. Any blaze could then potentially spread towards the reactor buildings, where a fire would have disastrous implications far beyond the immediate region. “This situation is very dangerous not only for the plant, for Ukraine, but also for the whole world because you never can say what the weather would be like and what the wind direction [would be].” Many other military vehicles are lined up under overpasses, built to house pipes and walkways between reactor and turbine complexes, Kotin said, perhaps to provide protection from drones. He praised about 9,000 workers who are still on duty at the plant, from a prewar workforce of about 11,000. Many evacuated their families but stayed at their posts because of the need for a skilled team to operate it. Modernisations to Ukraine’s nuclear plants in the wake of the Chornobyl disaster means that although the plant was built to Soviet specifications, Russian engineers don’t have the skills to operate it. “Actually, for us they are heroes, just doing their job in such unbelievable conditions,” said Kotin, who knows the plant, and its workers well because he spent most of his career there. He arrived as a young graduate and rose to become general manager. Rockets have also landed within two dozen metres of 174 spent fuel containers housed at the plant, which would be more vulnerable to weapons than the reactors, which are built to withstand the impact of a passenger jet. “It will probably withstand two explosions of maybe two missiles on one container and after that, it will be broken,” he said. “Actually we had a rocket came in just 10, 20 metres just from the site [where the containers are stored].” However, Kotin said that he hoped nuclear inspectors would be able to visit the Zaporizhzhia plant within “one, maybe two weeks”. “There is progress in negotiations … there is only modalities of the mission to finally agree between parties, and after that they will go. And actually I’ve seen some plans that they are to go at the end of the month.” He said he also had confidence that Ukrainian workers who have sacrificed so much for the plant would be able to keep it safe. “In any case, we won’t allow Russians to bring the world to the nuclear catastrophe and we will do everything just to return the plant to under our full control and operate it safely reliably, like it always been.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/jan/08/california-storms-thousands-without-power","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-08T16:41:34Z","webTitle":"Thousands without power in California as it braces for next onslaught of storms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/08/california-storms-thousands-without-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/jan/08/california-storms-thousands-without-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Torrential downpours and damaging winds left hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses without power in California early on Sunday as the area braced for the next onslaught of severe weather. More than 560,000 homes were reported to be still without power in California as of early Sunday, according to data from PowerOutage.us. At least six people have died in the severe weather since New Year’s weekend, including a toddler killed by a fallen redwood tree crushing a mobile home in northern California. Forecasters have meanwhile warned yet another “atmospheric river” of dense, moist tropical air will clobber California on Monday with rain and mountain snow. That weather is just the first of five approaching atmospheric rivers – a stream of storms that will continue until about 19 January – arrived in the state this weekend. An NWS weather alert on Saturday warned that the cumulative effect of successive heavy rain storms since late December could bring rivers to record high levels and cause flooding across much of central California. The heavy recent rains have had a huge impact on the state and caused rivers and streams to overflow, sent floods down street and highways, and submerged vehicles, homes, and businesses. The storms have also whipped waves to historic heights along the California coast. Drought-hit California had been on track for another dry winter until the stacked atmospheric rivers came into play.

The numbers involved are not impressive; as things stand, only 14 German tanks will get a fresh lick of paint with Ukrainian military markings. Still, his decision has removed a significant obstacle to Ukraine’s rearmament. Finland, Poland, Portugal and the Netherlands have already announced that they will transfer some of their Leopards and Norway and Spain are not far behind. The Leopard tank contingent could, therefore, end up being quite substantial, providing Ukraine with the ability to flush out Russian troops from their dugouts, thereby injecting much-needed mobility into a war of attrition that currently allows Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to kill civilians and pulverise Ukraine’s economic infrastructure systematically and primarily with impunity. Nato governments are relieved that Scholz has finally made the right choice, albeit only after trying everything else. The United States and Europe are “fully, thoroughly, totally united”, President Joe Biden joyfully claimed after the German tank decision became known. And reports from Berlin indicate that, far from being apologetic about his dithering, Scholz believes that he has acquitted himself well. He kept his Social Democratic party united on a profoundly controversial question. He also persuaded the Americans to supply their tanks alongside Germany’s. Sadly, much of this positive narrative is wishful thinking, for it ignores both the abrupt collapse of Germany’s influence in Europe and the continent’s profound strategic transformation because of the Ukraine war. The decision to supply Ukraine with tanks amounts to a significant deepening of western military involvement in the conflict; Ukraine’s western backers have agreed to take a higher risk because they concluded – correctly – that allowing Putin’s war of attrition to continue is far riskier. But this is just the first in many further escalatory steps that Nato governments are certain to face in the coming months, regardless of how the war develops. If the inevitable Russian spring offensive against Ukraine proves more successful than currently feared, demands will grow for the supply of fighter jets to Ukraine’s armed forces. So will suggestions of an even more direct Nato involvement in defending Ukraine’s skies. Today, that’s unthinkable. But then, supplying western tanks was also taboo until recently. Conversely, if the anticipated Ukrainian offensive does better than Nato military planners anticipate, the question of the liberation of occupied Crimea – with the expected fleeing of hundreds of thousands of Russian settlers from the peninsula – will arise. And so would the risk that the Putin regime will resort to a nuclear escalation in order to stave off total humiliation and collapse. Scholz’s propensity to take every strategic decision far too late and only under duress has already seriously damaged European security. But it could be catastrophic to the critical choices facing Nato in the months ahead. The chancellor has done little to explain to ordinary Germans what the impending delivery of tanks means for his country’s engagement or how he views the next steps in the war. Unsurprisingly, his public opinion remains divided, with “half of Germans sitting in the tank and the other half seeking to jump out”, as the Russian-born writer Wladimir Kaminer aptly put it. The only proposition Germans now accept is that Scholz lacks leadership qualities; the latest opinion polls indicate that only a quarter of voters consider him a strong leader. So, far from being transformative, Germany’s tank decision offers no reassurance that the future strategic choices of Europe’s most significant and wealthiest nation will be reached with the speed or the determination that will be increasingly necessary. Nor is there a serious appreciation in Berlin of how much Germany will need to adapt to the fundamental changes that have taken place in Europe because of the Ukraine carnage. The continent’s strategic centre of gravity has shifted decisively from its western tip, where Germany and France used to decide matters, and towards central and eastern Europe. Throughout the Ukraine war, pressure from countries such as the Baltic states and Poland forced Berlin into making a choice. These nations have gained moral authority because they were far more lucid and realistic about the danger of an imperial Russia and are also exercising a more direct and practical influence over the continent’s decision-making. This means that some of the old dreams about promoting a “European strategic autonomy” distinct from the US are redundant; Scholz indirectly acknowledged Europe’s dependence on the US last week by demanding that American tanks accompany German ones into Ukraine. It also means that Franco-German plans to uphold a clear distinction between countries in or out of institutions such as the European Union and Nato must be abandoned. Britain remains a critical player in European security, notwithstanding Brexit. Despite the absence of any formal security connection with the EU, its reputation, footprint and influence in the conduct of the Ukraine war are far more extensive than that of either France or Germany. And, conversely, no future stability and security for Ukraine are feasible without that country becoming – in substance, if not in form – a member of both the EU and Nato. Germany’s real task is to acknowledge this fundamental European transformation. Instead, Scholz still seems to believe that, as he recently put it, if Russia withdraws its troops from Ukraine, “we can come back to a peace order that worked and make it safe again”. This is utter nonsense. Germany will reassert its European importance when the guns eventually fall silent and the world looks to Berlin’s deep pockets to help with Ukraine’s reconstruction. But Germany will struggle to influence the reshaping of Europe’s security map. • Dr Jonathan Eyal is associate director, strategic research partnerships, Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This was an extraordinary evening from Rachlin, the London Philharmonic and Klaus Mäkelä, the 27-year-old Finn already lined up to be the Concertgebouw’s next chief conductor. Shostakovich’s Violin Concerto No 1 is a long and gruelling play for a violinist but one that Rachlin seemed visibly to be enjoying even halfway through the finale. His deliberate, careful phrasing at the very beginning set the tone for a performance in which nothing was thrown away, not even in the most frenzied episodes, which Mäkelä drove hard and fast. In the long lines of the final movement Rachlin’s violin continued to sing out even as the orchestral sound swelled behind him; by the end he seemed unvanquishable. Something invincible courses through Thomas Larcher’s Symphony No 2 as well: is it the sea, fear, or the will to live? This 2016 work, subtitled Kenotaph, is a searing commemoration of the thousands of refugees who had drowned in the Mediterranean. It’s a dazzling piece of writing that manages to evoke terror with its sounds of heavy sea swell and panic with its jangling tintinnabulations, but is also almost playful in its light-handed way with references and with timbre – a fleeting touch of Bach, a wheezy accordion, rasping percussion that seems periodically to leach the pitch from the rest of the orchestra. Its scope is Mahlerian, and it sounded like a masterpiece here, Mäkelä drawing a performance of huge assurance from the LPO. Following the Larcher with the Adagio from Mahler’s 10th Symphony felt absolutely appropriate – and yet Mäkelä’s assertive approach, emphasising the angularity of its melodies, didn’t quite let it achieve transcendence. It was still moving, though, and the fact that even this piece could feel anticlimactic in context just speaks of the impact of what we had already heard."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/05/germany-to-delay-phase-out-of-nuclear-plants-to-shore-up-energy-security","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-05T17:05:03Z","webTitle":"Germany to delay phase-out of nuclear plants to shore up energy security ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/05/germany-to-delay-phase-out-of-nuclear-plants-to-shore-up-energy-security","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/05/germany-to-delay-phase-out-of-nuclear-plants-to-shore-up-energy-security","fields":{"bodyText":"Germany is to temporarily halt the phasing-out of two nuclear power plants in an effort to shore up energy security after Russia cut supplies of gas to Europe’s largest economy. The economy minister, Robert Habeck, announced on Monday that the power plants, Neckarwestheim in Baden Württemberg and Isar 2 in Bavaria, are to be kept running longer than planned in order to be used as an emergency reserve until the middle of next year. Habeck said that after a stress test carried out with four grid operators, considered worst-case scenarios, they had come to the conclusion that “hourly crisis-like situations in the electricity supply system during winter 22/23, while very unlikely, cannot be fully ruled out”. He insisted that Germany had “very high supply security” and that the two nuclear plants should remain “on standby until mid-April 2023, in order, if necessary, to provide an additional contribution to the electricity grid in southern Germany”. The nuclear power plants would be available for operation, and fully staffed, but only on standby and would not produce electricity unless it was deemed necessary. He insisted that Germany would continue to stick by its plans – regulated by law – to withdraw from nuclear power. The plants were due to be mothballed by the end of December, the last of Germany’s nuclear power plants to cease working, after a dramatic 2011 decision by Angela Merkel, the then chancellor, in reaction to the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan. The extraordinary upending of energy markets since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February has however led to a dramatic rethink. Power bills across the continent have been soaring in light of dwindling supplies, putting households and businesses under extreme pressure as winter approaches. The sense of urgency increased when Russia failed to turn on the fifth and last functioning turbine on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline which had carried gas from Russia via the Baltic Sea to Germany. Moscow cited faults on the line, which it said were linked to the sanctions imposed on it. Discussions on extending the lifetime of the plants have triggered a heated debate in Germany, where nuclear power has been a source of controversy for decades. An announcement by Habeck, a leading figure in the anti-nuclear Green party, on restarting the plants would once have been unthinkable, but the party has come under increasing pressure, especially from its coalition partner, the pro-business FDP, to pause the phase-out. Many in the FDP hope that today’s announcement may lead to a complete rethink on the phase-out policy, arguing that nuclear power would help Germany achieve its zero-carbon emission goals sooner, as well as helping to secure long-term energy security. The Green party has rejected this position. “In the winter, our towns and cities will in part be darker because of the fact we have to save electricity. In this situation we should not forgo safer and climate-friendly ways of producing electricity such as nuclear power. This requires more than just extending their operation,” said finance minister Christian Lindner, who is head of the FDP. Already Germany had been forced to restart mothballed coal-fired power plants, considered the most environmentally damaging source of fuel, which Habeck has stressed was a temporary and painful but necessary measure. So far polls show that the majority of Germans are understanding of the need to at least temporarily revert to nuclear power, given the urgency of the situation, even if they don’t like it. Habeck has also been trying to fill Germany’s gas storage facilities, using supplies from Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. Despite Russia’s total switch-off, storage levels stood at just under 86% on Monday. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, said on Monday that the failure to resume supplies from Nord Stream 1 after the impromptu maintenance work was owing to “problems with pumping gas [that] arose due to sanctions that were imposed against our country”. Extending the lifetime of the plants is, though, not expected to boost Germany’s energy supplies by much. Habeck has said they make up just 2% of Germany’s electricity output. He had repeatedly ruled out resurrecting the plants, while chancellor Olaf Scholz had said it “could make sense”. Scholz unveiled a new series of inflation relief measures on Sunday, amounting to 65bn euros and encompassing everything from a rise in child support to assistance in housing benefit to cover high energy bills. Groups and political parties of the far left and far right have pledged an autumn of protests against higher living costs, the first of which is due to kick off in the eastern city of Leipzig on Monday evening."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/jan/27/lionel-messi-guardian-top-100-premier-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-27T10:09:10Z","webTitle":"Lionel Messi leaves top 100 field in wake but Premier League also shows power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/27/lionel-messi-guardian-top-100-premier-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/jan/27/lionel-messi-guardian-top-100-premier-league","fields":{"bodyText":"It is sometimes easy to forget that Lionel Messi retired from international football in 2016. Argentina had just lost in the Copa América to Chile, a fourth final defeat in nine years, and Messi had missed a penalty in the shootout. “For me, the national team is over,” he said. “I’ve done all I can. It hurts not to be a champion.” Luckily for Messi, and Argentinian football fans, he changed his mind two months later, in time for the 2018 World Cup qualifiers. The tournament in Russia did not bring the success he or his country had hoped for but three years later it all fell into place for the captain with victory in the Copa América. That win ensured he had his international trophy, but it also meant the pressure had been lifted. Messi was playing for Argentina with a smile again. That lifted the player and his teammates to new heights and it culminated in La Albiceleste winning the 2022 World Cup. The win in Qatar naturally had a huge impact on the voting for the Guardian’s top 100 footballers and it is not outlandish to think that Kylian Mbappé would have finished as the No 1 had France won the shootout against Argentina. But they did not and Messi ended up as the clear winner in our vote with 76% (156 out of 206 judges) of our panel picking him as their No 1. It is a stark contrast to last year’s winner, Robert Lewandowski, who was top of 53% of the judges’ lists. It is a decade since we did our first list and Messi has never been out of our top three, staying remarkably consistent and popular with the judges. The only time he fell out of the top two was in 2018 when Luka Modric usurped him and Cristiano Ronaldo, with the Portuguese in second. The Argentina coach, Lionel Scaloni, is obviously biased but when asked in Qatar whether Messi was the best player ever he said: “Sometimes as Argentinians it of course looks like we say that just because we are Argentinian. Maybe it’s selfish [but] I don’t have any doubt saying that: he is the best in history.” Messi failed to inspire Paris St-Germain to win the Champions League and that is reflected in the standings of which side have the most players on our list. Manchester City stay top despite, like PSG, falling to the comeback machine that was Real Madrid. Madrid are second with 11 players in the top 100, including Rodrygo for the first time, and have four of the top 10: Karim Benzema, Modric, Vinícius Júnior and Thibaut Courtois, who was outstanding in that final win against Liverpool in Paris. Bayern Munich have the fourth-most players on the list despite going out to Villarreal in the Champions League quarter-finals and despite Germany having a disappointing World Cup. Their highest-ranked player is Sadio Mané, who joined from Liverpool in the summer. PSG still suffer from having a top heavy team, with Messi, Mbappé and Neymar in the top 15 but the only teammates to join them on the top 100 being Achraf Hakimi and Marquinhos. Brazil have the most players on our list with 14. Some of the biggest stars are joined further down the list by players such as Gabriel Barbosa, Bruno Guimarães, Fabinho and Thiago Silva. It shows that the rankings are not solely based on the World Cup, despite the timing of the tournament, which meant the deadline for votes was a few weeks after the final. France are also ahead of Argentina with veterans such as Antoine Griezmann and Olivier Giroud, who is 30th after helping Milan to the Serie A title and having a good World Cup, making the top 100 alongside younger players such as Christopher Nkunku and Aurélien Tchouaméni. The strongest league, according to our panel at least, is the behemoth that is the Premier League. It is continuing to grow – albeit only by one player compared with 2021 – and has 43 representatives, with La Liga, Serie A and the Bundesliga staying at the same number as the previous list. It is worth noting that although we have a 35-year-old winner and the same winner as 10 years ago, there is an abundance of young, talented players coming through. It is clear to see that Mbappé is a likely future winner but there are younger players than the 24-year-old on the list who are upwardly mobile. Erling Haaland and Vinícius are 22 and in the top 10, while Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, Jamal Musiala, Bukayo Saka, Pedri, Gavi and Tchouaméni are set to improve their positions. Nothing lasts for ever, they say, and that will be true of Messi being the Guardian’s No 1, but for now he is holding off the youngsters. Let’s see what 2023 brings."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2023/apr/17/google-chief-ai-harmful-sundar-pichai","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-17T10:43:58Z","webTitle":"Google chief warns AI could be harmful if deployed wrongly","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/17/google-chief-ai-harmful-sundar-pichai","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/apr/17/google-chief-ai-harmful-sundar-pichai","fields":{"bodyText":"Google’s chief executive has said concerns about artificial intelligence keep him awake at night and that the technology can be “very harmful” if deployed wrongly. Sundar Pichai also called for a global regulatory framework for AI similar to the treaties used to regulate nuclear arms use, as he warned that the competition to produce advances in the technology could lead to concerns about safety being pushed aside. In an interview on CBS’s 60 minutes programme, Pichai said the negative side to AI gave him restless nights. “It can be very harmful if deployed wrongly and we don’t have all the answers there yet – and the technology is moving fast. So does that keep me up at night? Absolutely,” he said. Google’s parent, Alphabet, owns the UK-based AI company DeepMind and has launched an AI-powered chatbot, Bard, in response to ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by the US tech firm OpenAI, which has become a phenomenon since its release in November. Pichai said governments would need to figure out global frameworks for regulating AI as it developed. Last month, thousands of artificial intelligence experts, researchers and backers – including the Twitter owner Elon Musk – signed a letter calling for a pause in the creation of “giant” AIs for at least six months, amid concerns that development of the technology could get out of control. Asked if nuclear arms-style frameworks could be needed, Pichai said: “We would need that.” The AI technology behind ChatGPT and Bard, known as a Large Language Model, is trained on a vast trove of data taken from the internet and is able to produce plausible responses to prompts from users in a range of formats, from poems to academic essays and software coding. The image-generating equivalent, in systems such as Dall-E and Midjourney, has also triggered a mixture of astonishment and alarm by producing realistic images such as the pope sporting a puffer jacket. Pichai added that AI could cause harm through its ability to produce disinformation. “It will be possible with AI to create, you know, a video easily. Where it could be Scott [Pelley, the CBS interviewer] saying something, or me saying something, and we never said that. And it could look accurate. But you know, on a societal scale, you know, it can cause a lot of harm.” The Google chief added that the version of its AI technology now available to the public, via the Bard chatbot, was safe. He added that Gooogle was being responsible by holding back more advanced versions of Bard for testing. Pichai’s comments came as the New York Times reported on Sunday that Google was building a new AI-powered search engine in response to Microsoft’s rival service Bing, which has been integrated with the chatbot technology behind ChatGPT. Pichai admitted that Google did not fully understand how its AI technology produced certain responses. “There is an aspect of this which we call, all of us in the field call it as a ‘black box’. You know, you don’t fully understand. And you can’t quite tell why it said this, or why it got wrong.” Asked by the CBS journalist Scott Pelley why Google had released Bard publicly when he didn’t fully understand how it worked, Pichai replied: “Let me put it this way. I don’t think we fully understand how a human mind works either.” Pichai admitted that society did not appear to be ready for rapid advances in AI. He said there “seems to be a mismatch” between the pace at which society thinks and adapts to change compared with the pace at which AI was evolving. However, he added that at least people have become alert to its potential dangers more quickly. “Compared to any other technology, I’ve seen more people worried about it earlier in its life cycle. So I feel optimistic,” he said. Pichai said the economic impact of AI would be significant because it would impact everything. He added: “This is going to impact every product across every company and so that’s why I think it’s a very, very profound technology.” Using a medical example, Pichai said in five to 10 years a radiologist could be working with an AI assistant to help prioritise cases. He added that “knowledge workers” such as writers, accountants, architects and software engineers would be affected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/oct/11/russia-use-nuclear-weapons-gchq-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-11T08:59:00Z","webTitle":"No signs Russia is preparing to use nuclear weapon, says GCHQ boss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/oct/11/russia-use-nuclear-weapons-gchq-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/oct/11/russia-use-nuclear-weapons-gchq-putin","fields":{"bodyText":"The head of GCHQ has said the UK spy agency has not seen any indicators that Russia is preparing to use a tactical nuclear weapon in or around Ukraine despite recent bellicose statements from Vladimir Putin. Jeremy Fleming, speaking on Tuesday morning, said it was one of GCHQ’s tasks to monitor whether the Kremlin was taking any of the preliminary steps needed before a tactical weapon was being made ready. “The way in which the Russian military machine and President Putin are conducting this war, they are staying within the doctrine that we understand for their use, including for nuclear weapons,” Fleming said. But he added that there was no sign that Russia was engaged in any technical preparatory steps: “I would hope that we would see indicators if they started to go down that path,” the spy chief said in a BBC interview. So-called tactical nuclear weapons – which can have a destructive power about six times greater than the Hiroshima bomb – are assembled by pairing a nuclear warhead with a conventional missile with a shorter-range. They are different from the long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are controlled by Russia, the US and other nuclear powers and can be deployed rapidly for the purpose of striking against each other in an uncontrolled war. Experts say it takes time to move such warheads out of storage and it should be possible for a spy agency such as GCHQ or its US counterpart, the NSA, to monitor such movements. “It’s a visible process,” said Pavel Podvig, a Russian nuclear expert and senior research fellow at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research. “If it’s really rushed you are talking about hours. It will be visible and be made visible.” Last month Putin said he would use “all available means” to defend Russian territory, including parts of Ukraine that he had unilaterally sought to annex – and argued the atomic bombs dropped in 1945 by the US “created a precedent”. That prompted the US president, Joe Biden, to warn last week that the world was closer to Armageddon than at any time since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 – although aides said subsequently his comments were not based on fresh intelligence or information. Fleming’s remarks preceded a speech he is due to give on Tuesday afternoon, in which he will accuse Putin of making strategic errors in his pursuit of the war in Ukraine, partly because there are so few restraints on his leadership. Russian soldiers are running out of supplies and munitions and initial gains made by Moscow are being reversed, Fleming is expected to add in the rare public address. “Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machine spouted, it is clear that Ukraine’s courageous action on the battlefield and in cyberspace is turning the tide,” Fleming will say. Focusing on the Russian president directly, Fleming is expected to say that “with little effective internal challenge, his decision-making has proved flawed” and that he has engaged in “a high-stakes strategy that is leading to strategic errors in judgment”. On Monday, Moscow launched a wave of missile strikes aimed at Kyiv and other urban centres, killing at least 11 people, which Putin said was in response to the weekend bombing of the bridge connecting occupied Crimea to Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/dec/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-us-denounces-putins-loose-talk-on-nuclear-weapons-zelenskiy-reports-fierce-fighting-in-bakhmut","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-08T18:45:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kyiv ‘working with UN to demilitarise Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-us-denounces-putins-loose-talk-on-nuclear-weapons-zelenskiy-reports-fierce-fighting-in-bakhmut","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/dec/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-us-denounces-putins-loose-talk-on-nuclear-weapons-zelenskiy-reports-fierce-fighting-in-bakhmut","fields":{"bodyText":"It’s coming up to 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue attacking Ukrainian energy systems despite global criticism of strikes that have left millions without electricity and water at the start of winter. The Russian leader presented the strikes as a response to a blast on Moscow’s bridge to annexed Crimea and other attacks, accusing Kyiv of blowing up power lines from the Kursk nuclear power plant and not supplying water to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Russia is still set on seizing parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that Putin claimed as his own, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. He added that the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine, which Russia annexed in 2014, was vulnerable to attacks by Ukrainian forces, after officials there said they had shot down a drone near a key naval base. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said his government was working with the UN’s nuclear watchdog agency to create a safety zone around the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Kyiv remained “in close contact” with Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), he said at a joint press conference with his Slovak counterpart, Rastislav Káčer, in Kyiv. Russia has claimed that its proposed safety zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is to “stop Ukrainian shelling”. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, also said the US’s withdrawal from a treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles was a “destructive” act that created a vacuum and stoked additional security risks. Russian shelling of a town in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine has left one person dead and two injured, according to the region’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. At least 12 houses were destroyed by the shelling in the town of Toretsk, he said in a Telegram post. About 10,000 Ukrainian service personnel and roughly the same number of Ukrainian civilians are believed to be being held in Russian detention facilities, according to a Ukrainian official. Oleksandr Kononenko, who oversees human rights in the security and defence sector on behalf of Ukraine’s parliament, said the civilians were being detained illegally as prisoners of war because of their alleged association with the Ukrainian army or state. Explosions have been reported at Berdiansk airbase in the Zaporizhzhia region. Three large explosions were heard, as well as smaller ones, near the city on the coast of the Sea of Azov. Russian forces have fired more than 1,000 rockets and missiles at Ukraine’s power grid, which is still working despite taking major damage, a senior official said. Volodymyr Kudrytsky, the chief executive of the grid operator Ukrenergo, also told a meeting arranged by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that his officials were scouring the world for the complex equipment needed for repairs. Ukraine has introduced new emergency power cuts as it tried to repair energy infrastructure damaged in Russian airstrikes, which the national grid operator said had caused significant supply shortages. The grid operator Ukrenergo said the situation was complicated by the weather, with western regions facing frost, rain, snow and strong winds that were causing wires to ice over, but the most difficult situation was in eastern areas, where fighting has been fiercest. Russian troops are reportedly taking part in tactical exercises in Belarus, according to the Russian defence ministry. Video clips posted by the ministry showed Russian soldiers in snow gear training near tanks in a winter landscape, firing weapons including artillery. Russia freed the jailed US basketball star Brittney Griner on Thursday in a high-level prisoner exchange for the notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout, who had been held in a US prison for 12 years. Joe Biden, who had made Griner’s release a top priority after she spent almost 10 months in jail on drugs charges, said in an address from the White House that he had spoken with Griner and found her “in good spirits”. The mother of Viktor Bout has thanked Vladimir Putin for her son’s release as part of a swap with the US. Bout, nicknamed the “Merchant of Death”, is a former Soviet lieutenant colonel whom the US justice department once described as one of the world’s most prolific arms dealers. Russian state media reported that he had arrived back in the country. Biden expressed regret that the deal did not include Paul Whelan, an American jailed since December 2018 on espionage charges that his family and the US government say are baseless. An anonymous US official told CNN that leaving Whelan out of the deal had been “a difficult decision” but “it was a choice to get Brittney or nothing”. The EU plans to tighten up sanctions on Russia’s military and industrial complex, pro-Kremlin media and Russian nationalist groups fighting in Ukraine, according to leaked papers. A total of eight individuals are facing personal sanctions, including Russian officials said to be involved in the illegal transfer and adoption of Ukrainian children in Russia, as well as the leaders of rightwing nationalist groups. Pope Francis broke down and wept as he prayed for peace in Ukraine during a traditional Christmas visit to the Spanish Steps in Rome. Reuters reports that Francis had to stop speaking and was unable to continue for about 30 seconds, and his head trembled. He later tweeted that “peace is possible; disarmament is possible”. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine, including of the village of Posad-Pokrovske, in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region. The notorious arms dealer, Viktor Bout, has arrived back in Russia after his release from US detention in a prisoner swap with Brittney Griner, Russian state media reported. The White House has said the grant of clemency for Bout, nicknamed the “Merchant of Death”, was not approved until today. Russian shelling of a town in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine has left one person dead and two injured, according to the region’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. At least 12 houses were destroyed by the shelling in the town of Toretsk, he said in a Telegram post. Kyrylenko wrote: 1 person was killed, 2 more were wounded in artillery shelling of Toretsk. Shells hit a private sector, destroying and damaging at least 12 houses. The Russians are again cynically shelling civilians — they are continuing their terror tactics. The mother of the notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout has thanked Vladimir Putin for her son’s release as part of a swap with the US. Bout, nicknamed the “Merchant of Death”, is a former Soviet lieutenant colonel whom the US justice department once described as one of the world’s most prolific arms dealers. He was serving a 25-year sentence for conspiring to sell tens of millions of dollars worth of weapons that US officials said were to be used against Americans. He was released from US detention in a prisoner swap for the American basketball star Brittney Griner. He is expected to arrive in Moscow shortly. The release happened “thanks to our president”, Raisa Bout said in televised remarks reported by AFP. She said: I am so grateful. A low maternal bow to the Russian foreign ministry with Lavrov Sergei Viktorovich at its helm. She said she was also grateful to “kind people” in the US, adding: “You cannot say that all of them are evil.” Russia’s human rights commissioner, Tatiana Moskalkova, described Bout as a “wonderful man who has become a victim of American insinuations”. The US basketball star Brittney Griner has been released from a Russian jail and is on her way back to the US, President Joe Biden said. The Russian foreign ministry said it had traded Griner for Viktor Bout, a notorious arms dealer who had been held in a US prison for 12 years. The swap took place at an airport in Abu Dhabi, Russian news agencies reported. Griner, 32, a two-time Olympic gold medallist, was arrested on 17 February. Talks to secure her release were complicated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February and the subsequent souring of ties between Washington and Moscow. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said his government was working with the UN’s nuclear watchdog agency to create a safety zone around the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Kyiv remained “in close contact” with Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), he said at a joint press conference with his Slovak counterpart, Rastislav Káčer, in Kyiv. Kuleba said: Of course, we are all interested in ensuring that all nuclear power plants, not only the Zaporizhzhia NPP, are safe. This is extremely difficult to achieve without stopping Russian missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine, but we are moving forward step by with mutual understanding with the IAEA. There is a rule in diplomacy that nothing is agreed upon until everything is agreed. Ukraine’s state nuclear energy firm Energoatom earlier today repeated Kyiv’s claims that Russia was using the site as a de facto weapons depot. Energoatom said Russia had brought multiple rocket launchers to the site and stationed them near the plant’s power unit No 6. It went on to claim that Russian forces planned to use them to launch attacks against Ukrainian positions and bridges on the western bank of the Dnipro River. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has come under repeated shelling since Moscow seized it shortly after launching its invasion in February, prompting the IAEA to call for a demilitarised safety zone around the plant. Earlier, we reported that Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue attacking Ukraine’s energy grid and presented the strikes as a response to the explosion on Moscow’s bridge to annexed Crimea in October. “Yes, we do that,” Putin said of the strikes on the Ukraine grid. “But who started it?” Here’s a clip of Putin speaking while attending a military awards ceremony in the Kremlin today: Pope Francis broke down and wept as he prayed for peace in Ukraine during a traditional Christmas visit to the Spanish Steps in Rome. The pope’s voice began to tremble as he mentioned the suffering of Ukrainians. He said: I would have liked to have brought you the thanks of the Ukrainian people … Reuters reports that Francis had to stop speaking and was unable to continue for about 30 seconds, and his head trembled. The crowd, which included the mayor of Rome, Roberto Gualtieri, applauded when they realised he was unable to talk and saw him crying. When he resumed the prayer, his voice was cracking. He continued: …the Ukrainian people for the peace we have so long asked the Lord. Instead I must present you with the pleas of children, elderly, mothers and fathers and the young people of that martyred land, that is suffering so much. He later tweeted that “peace is possible; disarmament is possible”. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue attacking Ukrainian energy systems despite global criticism of strikes that have left millions without electricity and water at the start of winter.

Good afternoon from London. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, I’ll be bringing you all the latest global developments on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. The commodities trading firm Trafigura is to hand more than $1.7bn to its top traders and shareholders after the energy crisis, fuelled by the war in Ukraine, led to a surge in profits. Trafigura, one of the world’s largest specialist commodity traders, posted a record $7bn net profit in its last financial year, more than the previous four years combined, after making gains from the market volatility caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Its chief financial officer, Christophe Salmon, hailed an “exceptionally strong year” as profits more than doubled and revenues grew to $318.5bn in the year to 30 September, up from $231.3bn a year earlier. The $1.71bn payout to its 1,100 shareholders, including top employees, equates to about $1.56m a head if shared equally. That’s an increase of about 35% compared with 2021’s dividend of $1.12bn to about 1,000 top traders and investors. Oil and gas companies, as well as some electricity generators, have faced windfall taxes as a result of the gains made since the invasion. However, politicians have not moved to curb the profits of commodity traders. Strong trading performances have boosted multinationals including the British oil firms BP and Shell. Read the full story here: Speaking earlier, Joe Biden said Russia was treating the case of the detained American Paul Whelan “differently” but that the US “will never give up” on securing his release. Biden said: Sadly and for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul’s case differently than Brittney’s. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul’s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up. The Biden administration has offered Moscow multiple options to secure Whelan, a US official told journalists today. From the Washington Post’s John Hudson: And from Nick Schifrin from PBS: Explosions have been heard at Berdiansk airbase in the Zaporizhzhia region. Three large explosions were heard, as well as smaller ones, near the city on the coast of the Sea of Azov. Emergency services have been reported as making their way to the scene. No casualties have been reported. Russia has used the 35th anniversary of the historic signing of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) to criticise the US for withdrawing from the agreement in 2019. At the time, the then US president Donald Trump gave his reason for doing so as “developing our own military response options,” to Russia’s missiles. Nato allies later backed the US by issuing a statement attributing responsibility for the treaty’s demise to Russia. When the treaty was signed in 1987, the agreement between the US and the Soviet Union to reduce their nuclear arsenals was hailed by some commentators as a significant step towards a non-nuclear world. This is how the Guardian reported the historic event. Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue attacking Ukrainian energy systems despite global criticism of strikes that have left millions without electricity and water at the start of winter. “There’s a lot of noise about our strikes on the energy infrastructure of a neighbouring country. Yes, we do that. But who started it?” Putin said at an awards ceremony in the Kremlin, according to Agence France-Presse, adding that the criticism would “not interfere with our combat missions”. He presented the strikes as a response to a blast on Moscow’s bridge to annexed Crimea and other attacks, accusing Kyiv of blowing up power lines from the Kursk nuclear power plant and not supplying water to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. “Not supplying water to a city of more than a million people is an act of genocide,” Putin said. He accused the west of “complete silence” on this and of bias against Russia. “As soon as we move and do something in response, there is uproar and clamour spreading through the whole universe,” he said. Russia has faced claims that its attacks on Ukraine’s energy systems and infrastructure amount to war crimes. The EU plans to tighten up sanctions on Russia’s military and industrial complex, pro-Kremlin media and Russian nationalist groups fighting in Ukraine, according to leaked papers. The EU’s ninth set of restrictive measures on Russia since February’s invasion of Ukraine seek to close gaps in previous rounds, with further sanctions on 169 entities “which might contribute to the technological enhancement of Russia’s defence and security sector”, according to a draft text seen by the Guardian. These companies will face restrictions on their ability to buy from Europe so-called dual-use goods – civilian products that can be turned to military purposes. Previous EU sanctions have already imposed sweeping bans on hi-tech equipment, but this package adds items that were missed off the list such as generators, toy drones, laptops, cameras and lenses. According to a separate paper, four pro-Kremlin TV companies will lose their licence to broadcast in the EU, including NTV, Rossiya 1, Pervyi Kanal and REN TV, home to some of Russia’s high-profile talkshows featuring strident pro-war commentators. A total of eight individuals are facing personal sanctions, meaning a travel ban and freeze on any assets held in the EU, including Russian officials said to be involved in the illegal transfer and adoption of Ukrainian children in Russia, as well as the leaders of rightwing nationalist groups. In a largely symbolic move, six entities will see any EU assets frozen, including nationalist groups such as the Russian Imperial Legion, the Russian Imperial Movement and Taskforce Rusich. Unlike previous rounds of sanctions, the cost for EU countries is relatively small. Some ideas, such as a ban on the once lucrative trade in Russian diamonds, are conspicuous by their absence. The measures now have to be agreed by all 27 member states before coming into force. Speaking at the White House, Joe Biden formally announced the release of Brittney Griner from detention in Russia and pledged to continue working to bring home another American jailed in the country. “Moments ago, standing together with her wife, Cherelle, in the Oval Office, I spoke with Brittney Griner,” Biden said. She’s safe, she’s on a plane, she’s on her way home after months of being unjustly detained in Russia, held under intolerable circumstances. Brittney will soon be back in the arms of her loved ones, and she should have been there all along. He thanked officials in his administration who had worked for her release, as well as the United Arab Emirates, “because that’s where she landed”. The president said “the past few months have been hell” for Griner, her family and her teammates. He also mentioned the case of Paul Whelan, another American, whose release from Russia he said he was working on. “We’ve not forgotten about Paul Whelan, who’s been unjustly detained in Russia for years.” For live developments on the release of Griner, do follow our US politics live blog with my colleague Chris Stein: Around 10,000 Ukrainian service personnel and roughly the same number of Ukrainian civilians are believed to be being held in Russian detention facilities, according to Oleksandr Kononenko, who oversees human rights in the security and defence sector on behalf of Ukraine’s parliament. Konenenko said the civilians were being detained illegally as prisoners of war because of their alleged association with the Ukrainian army or state. Kononenko said: These are the total number of confirmed people who are classed as ‘missing under special circumstances’, we do not have the exact figures. Russia has not given the International Committee for the Red Cross access [to the information]. Though the ICRC has not been given full access, it has been able to visit some Ukrainian prisoners. On Thursday, the ICRC made a rare announcement that it had visited one Russian facility and that it planned to visit another this week. “ICRC teams are reaching out to families of prisoners of war to share updates from their loved ones. Most updates are short notes of love and personal news,” read the ICRC statement. In July, Oleh Kotenko, who is in charge of wartime missing people within the Ukrainian ministry for the occupied territories, put the total number of Ukrainian service personnel believed to be held by Russia at significantly less – 7,200. Kotenko said that although Ukraine had not heard from some of those reported missing, they were believed to be alive and in captivity. After Ukraine pushed Russian forces out of parts of Kharkiv and Kherson region, it has announced several prisoner swaps. The regularity of the swaps probably indicate that Ukraine detained Russian prisoners during their offensives. The former US marine Paul Whelan is still in Russian custody, his lawyer said, after news that Brittney Griner was released in a prisoner swap with the Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. Dialogue on a possible prisoner swap for Whelan is ongoing, his lawyer said. Whelan was convicted by a Russian court in 2020 on espionage charges and sentenced to 16 years in a Russian high-security prison. He denied the charges. Joe Biden has tweeted that he has spoken to Brittney Griner, following the announcement that she has been released from Russian detention. In a tweet, he posted pictures of him meeting with Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, at the White House. The US basketball star Brittney Griner has been released from Russian detention in a prisoner swap for the convicted Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout, US officials have confirmed. Griner was sentenced to nine years behind bars in Russia after being convicted on drug charges. A two-time Olympic gold medallist and champion, she was arrested on 17 February, a week before Russia sent troops into Ukraine, at a Moscow airport while in possession of vape cartridges containing cannabis oil, which is banned in Russia. Bout, known as “the merchant of death”, was one of the world’s most wanted men before his 2008 arrest on multiple charges related to arms trafficking. For almost two decades, he was one of the world’s most notorious arms dealers, selling weaponry to rogue states, rebel groups and murderous warlords in Africa, Asia and South America. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. The Kremlin has said the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine, which Russia annexed in 2014, was vulnerable to attacks by Ukrainian forces after officials there said they had shot down a drone near a key naval base. The Moscow-installed governor of Sevastopol, the largest city in annexed Crimea, said this morning that Russia’s fleet shot down a Ukrainian drone over the Black Sea. Speaking to reporters during his regular briefing, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: There are certainly risks because the Ukrainian side continues its policy of organising terrorist attacks. But, on the other hand, information we get indicates that effective countermeasures are being taken. His comments came after President Vladimir Putin recently made a visit to the Kerch bridge, the key link between annexed Crimea and mainland Russia which was partially destroyed by an explosion in October. The Russian-installed head of occupied Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said last month that he had ordered “fortification works to ensure the safety of Crimeans” to be built on the peninsula after recent attacks. Speaking during his briefing with reporters today, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia is still set on seizing parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that President Vladimir Putin claimed as his own. The Russian leader announced he had annexed four Ukrainian regions – Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk – after holding fake referendums in order to claim a mandate for his territorial claims. However Moscow does not have full control of any of the four provinces of Ukraine it says it annexed, and Peskov appeared to set a limit on the Ukrainian territory that Russia now sought to claim. Asked whether Russia planned to incorporate any more territories beyond the four regions, he replied: There is no question of that. At least, there have been no statements in this regard. But there is nevertheless a lot of work ahead to liberate the territories; in a number of new regions of the Russian Federation there are occupied territories that have to be liberated. I mean part of the Donetsk Republic, as well as what became part of the Russian Federation, and then was re-occupied by Ukrainian troops. My colleague Peter Beaumont is in Donbas, eastern Ukraine, amid worsening wintry conditions. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, has called on Russia to answer for “atrocities” committed by its forces in Ukraine. Thomas-Greenfield was responding to a report by the UN’s human rights office, published yesterday, that found that at least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks after President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights documented summary executions and attacks in dozens of towns across three regions, and warned the actual number of victims in the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions was likely to be much higher. The report covered the beginning of Moscow’s invasion on 24 February until early April, and gathered evidence from 102 towns and villages in Ukraine. It said: The acts in question were committed by Russian armed forces in control of these areas and led to the deaths of 441 civilians (341 men, 72 women, 20 boys and 8 girls). Many of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report said. Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in what it calls a “special military operation”. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said the US’s withdrawal from a treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles was a “destructive” act that created a vacuum and stoked additional security risks. The 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty had kept nuclear missiles off European soil for more than three decades, but the treaty expired in 2019 after the US and Russia failed to agree on how to keep it alive. Speaking on the 35th anniversary of the signing of the treaty by the US president, Ronald Reagan, and Soviet general secretary, Mikhail Gorbachev, Zakharova said: The INF treaty had an indefinite life and was able to provide predictable restraint in the missile sphere for many years to come. Russia has claimed that its proposed safety zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was to “stop Ukrainian shelling”. A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, made the comments this morning, according to Reuters. Both sides have accused each other of shelling the plant, which is Europe’s biggest nuclear power station. There are fears the attacks could cause a nuclear accident. Russia seized it shortly after its invasion in February. The International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog has called for a demilitarised safety zone around the plant. The Red Cross has visited Ukrainian and Russian prisoners of war in the past week, and it hopes that inspections can become more frequent. Since the Russian invasion the Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has seen hundreds of prisoners on both sides of the conflict. However its president, Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, said access had been “sporadic”. “My expectation is that these visits lead to more regular access to all prisoners of war,” the statement cited Spoljaric Egger as saying, according to Reuters. “While the recent visits are important progress, the ICRC must be granted unimpeded access to see all prisoners of war repeatedly and in private, wherever they are held.” The ICRC carried out a two-day visit to Ukrainian PoWs this week, according to Reuters. It also visited Russian PoWs last week. The UN human rights office said in November that its monitors had not been allowed access to Ukrainian prisoners held by Russia. Ukraine has introduced new emergency power cuts as it tried to repair energy infrastructure damaged in Russian airstrikes, which the national grid operator said had caused significant supply shortages. Russia targeted power facilities across Ukraine in the latest big wave of attacks on Monday, at a time of the year when energy consumption usually rises as temperatures plunge. “As of 11:00 on 8 December, because of damage caused by missile strikes to power plants and the high-voltage network, the system has a significant shortage of electricity,” the grid operator Ukrenergo said. It said the situation was complicated by the weather, with western regions facing frost, rain, snow and strong winds that were causing wires to ice over, Reuters reports, but the most difficult situation was in eastern areas, where fighting has been fiercest. “In all regions, there is a lack of energy – up to a third of what is needed,” said Oleksandr Starukh, the governor of the Zaporizhzhia region in south-eastern Ukraine. Monday’s attacks began as emergency blackouts were due to end, with previous damage repaired. DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private power producer, said there were now emergency power cuts in the capital Kyiv and the Kyiv region, in the southern region of Odesa and in Dnipro, central Ukraine. Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February, has increased attacks on energy facilities in recent weeks, saying strikes on vital infrastructure are militarily legitimate. Ukraine says attacks intended to cause civilian misery are a war crime. The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has produced a paper after Vladimir Putin’s meeting with the Russian presidential council on Wednesday where he said the war in Ukraine could be a “lengthy process”. Putin struck an imperialist tone. He compared himself to Peter the Great by noting that Russia controls the Sea of Azov, which the Russian tsar also fought for. The ISW said Putin seemed unwilling to go for a temporary break in fighting to regroup, as the Nato secretary general had suggested the Kremlin may look to do. “The Russian military is continuing offensive operations around Bakhmut and is – so far -denying itself the operational pause that would be consistent with best military practice. “Putin’s current fixation with continuing offensive operations around Bakhmut and elsewhere is contributing to Ukraine’s ability to maintain the military initiative in other parts of the theater. Ukraine’s continued operational successes depend on Ukrainian forces’ ability to continue successive operations through the winter of 2022-2023 without interruption,” the paper said. The report’s authors added that there appeared to be friction in the Belarusian military over Russian attempts to pressure them into joining the war. “[The] ISW continues to assess that Belarus is highly unlikely to enter the war in Ukraine due to domestic factors that constrain Lukashenko’s willingness to do so.” Our world affairs editor, Julian Borger, is in Zaporizhzhia, from where he has filed this dispatch as fighting intensifies in southern Kherson. The people of Nova Kakhovka on the east bank of the Dnipro River had grown accustomed to constant shelling, but in recent days they have been hearing machine gun fire as the war draws closer to what could be its next major battlefield. Despite predictions that the conflict would slow down in the winter months, civilians arriving in Zaporizhzhia through the last open crossing point on the frontlines say the fighting is escalating in southern Kherson region as Ukrainian forces seek to keep the Russians on the retreat towards Crimea and beyond. “It has been machine guns lately, not artillery,” said Anna, a 78-year-old from Nova Khakovka after arriving at a police checkpoint in Zaporizhzhia. “The windows were shaking, the house was shaking. We were afraid that everything could collapse at any moment.” Read more: Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said Moscow would keep to its moratorium on deploying intermediate-range nuclear forces in Europe, as long as the US did not deploy such weapons in Europe or Asia. “The moratorium is still in place, but if such weapons are deployed by the United States on European or Asian territory, our approach cannot remain unchanged,” Ryabkov told the Rossiya 24 news channel according to Reuters. He made similar comments a year ago. The UK Ministry of Defence has published its daily update on the situation in Ukraine according to its intelligence sources. It said Russia had an “almost continuous trench system” for a 60km (37 miles) stretch between Svatove in Luhansk oblast and the Russian border. The MoD added, however, that the depth of the defence remained “unclear”. Svatove is a small city to the north of Luhansk city. The region has been occupied since Russia’s initial invasion in 2014. The MoD said Russia’s 1st Guards Tank Army is partially deployed near Svatove but the “supposedly elite” group took heavy casualties earlier in the war, including in the retreat from Kharkiv in September 2022. “It has now been partially reinforced with mobilised reservists, although remaining well below its authorised strength of over 25,000 personnel,” the update added. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said Europe lacked “critical defence capabilities” at the annual conference of the European Defence Agency on Thursday. Addressing attendees he said it made Europe vulnerable to “higher-level threats”. His comment echoes a recent remark by the Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, who said “Europe isn’t strong enough” without the US. Here is the clip: As Christmas approaches, Ukrainian authorities are taking extra steps to try to create a festive feeling despite the conflict. In Kharkiv, which was occupied by Russian troops earlier this year, a tree has been erected in a subway to protect it from artillery or missiles. Russian forces are trying to use locals in Zaporizhzhia to fight for their army to replace Russian personnel who have been killed. The general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said in the Russian-occupied region, the authorities have issued summonses to men of conscription age in Melitopol. “The Russian occupiers plan to mobilise local residents in order to replenish current losses,” the update said. The Ukrainian army has killed another 340 Russian troops in the last 24 hours. More than 93,000 Russian personnel have been killed since 24 February, a post on Facebook by the general staff of the armed forces said. Battles on 8 December also led to the loss of two Russian battle tanks, two armoured combat vehicles and two artillery systems. A further two drones, which have been used to attack Ukraine’s infrastructure and residential areas, were shot down. These are figures provided by the Ukrainian side, which have not been verified by the Guardian. Russia’s published statistics show much lower numbers of losses. • The original key event headline on this blog entry has been corrected to make clear it was 93,000 Russian troops Ukraine is claiming have been killed. A Ukrainian pilot who shot down two missiles and five drones before ejecting from his plane has been awarded the Hero of Ukraine, the order of the Gold Star. Maj Vadym Voroshylov carried out the operation over the Vinnytsia oblast on 12 October, before ejecting from his jet after it had been damaged. A photo of him has been circulated on the internet in Ukraine this week, as he took a photo of himself bloodied but defiant afterwards, giving a thumbs-up to the camera. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy approved a government decree on Monday giving him the honour, in recognition of his service. Before I hand you over to my colleague, Harry Taylor, here are some of the latest snaps to come out of Ukraine today. The number of oil tankers waiting in the Black Sea to cross Istanbul’s Bosphorus strait on the way to the Mediterranean rose by five to 16 on Thursday, a shipping agency said, according to a Reuters report. Talks are continuing between western and Turkish officials on steps to resolve the tanker queues after new restrictions were rolled out aimed at Russian oil exports. The G7 group of countries, the European Union and Australia agreed to bar shipping service providers like insurers from helping export Russian oil unless it is sold at an enforced low price, or cap, to deprive Moscow of wartime revenue. But a separate Turkish measure in force since the start of the month has caused a logjam, requiring vessels to provide proof they have insurance covering the duration of their transit through the Bosphorus strait or when calling at Turkish ports. The Tribeca shipping agency named five new tankers longer than 200m waiting north of the Bosphorus strait to cross southbound towards the Mediterranean Sea, in addition to the 11 named a day earlier. It said no ships were scheduled to cross. At the Dardanelles strait further south, nine tankers were waiting to cross southbound, down from 12 a day earlier, the agency said. Three tankers were scheduled to pass through that strait on Thursday, two en route from Tuapse in Russia to Fujairah in the UAE and one en route from Tuzla in Turkey to Sidi Kerir in Egypt. Russian troops are reportedly taking part in tactical exercises in Belarus, according to the Russian defence ministry. Belarus has said it will not enter the war in Ukraine, but President Alexander Lukashenko has in the past ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near the Ukrainian border, citing threats from Kyiv and the west. In a statement cited by Reuters, Russia’s defence ministry said: Servicemen of the Western Military District ... continue intensive combat training on the ranges of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus … Combat training events are held during both daylight and at night. Servicemen are shooting from all types of small arms, as well as from mortars; they hone their skills in driving combat vehicles, pass psychological obstacle courses, study tactical medicine and other disciplines.” Video clips posted by the ministry showed Russian soldiers in snow gear training near tanks in a winter landscape, firing weapons including artillery. Ukraine used domestically-modified Soviet drones to strike Russian bases hundreds of miles from its border, according to a recent Politico report. The drones reportedly struck two military airbases in Russia killing three Russian service members and damaging two airplanes earlier this week. The drones used in the attack, according to two people familiar with the operation who spoke with Politico on the condition of anonymity, were modified Tu-141 surveillance aircraft left over from the Soviet era. “The key success factor was a surprise. Russia just did not expect anything of this sort,” said one of the individuals, who works with the Ukrainian government. “Now they will be prepared.” Ukraine has for months requested long-range missiles and drones from its western allies, but have so far been refused. Russian forces have fired more than 1,000 rockets and missiles at Ukraine’s power grid, which is still working despite taking major damage, Interfax Ukraine news agency cited a senior official as saying on Wednesday. Volodymyr Kudrytsky, chief executive of the Ukrenergo grid operator, also told a meeting arranged by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) that his officials were scouring the world for the complex equipment needed for repairs. Eight recent waves of Russian air strikes on critical infrastructure have seriously damaged the grid and led to emergency and planned outages across the country. Interfax Ukraine cited Kudrytsky as saying: These attacks represent the biggest blow to a power grid that humanity has ever seen. More than 1,000 shells and rockets were fired at electrical facilities and lines, including substations.” Ukraine now has a serious shortage of generating capacity, even though consumption is down between 25% and 30% compared to the pre-war period. The system is still working, it is integrated, not broken or disconnected,” Kudrytsky said. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy later said Ukraine was increasing the electricity supply every day but noted problems in Kyiv and several other regions. “We should not forget ... that it is impossible to restore 100% of the energy system, as it was before the beginning of the Russian energy terror,” he said in an evening video address. “Time is needed. That is why scheduled blackouts continue in most of the cities and districts,” he continued. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy provided a battleground update in his latest national address on Wednesday evening. Regarding the Donetsk region, Bakhmut districts and other hottest spots. A very fierce confrontation is ongoing there, every metre counts.” Zelenskiy also noted Russian forces made a “brutal, absolutely deliberate strike” on Kurakhove, also in the Donetsk region. The strike reportedly killed ten people. Today [Wednesday] the Russian army carried out a very brutal, absolutely deliberate strike at Kurakhove. Precisely at civilians. At ordinary people. At the market, elevator, gas station, bus station, residential building. The list of the dead so far includes ten people, there are many wounded.” The US has denounced “loose talk” on nuclear weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin mused on rising risks of nuclear war but said Moscow would not strike first. Putin hinted that “such a threat is rising” during a Kremlin meeting on Wednesday but assured that “Russia will under no circumstances use them first”. US State Department spokesman Ned Price, asked about Putin’s remarks, declined to reply directly but said: We think any loose talk of nuclear weapons is absolutely irresponsible.” Price said that nuclear powers around the world since the Cold War, including China, India, the United States and Russia itself, have been clear that “a nuclear war is something that must never be fought and can never be won.” We think any other rhetoric – whether it is nuclear saber-rattling or even raising the spectre of the use of tactical nuclear weapons – is something that is irresponsible,” Price said. It is dangerous, and it goes against the spirit of that statement that has been at the core of the nuclear non-proliferation regime since the Cold War.” US officials have voiced fear that Russia could use nuclear weapons if it feels routed on the battlefield and could plant a fictitious story to justify its actions. Putin dedicated some of his remarks on Wednesday to questions about the potential for nuclear war, which he said was growing more likely due to the conflict with the west. This threat is increasing, I can’t deny it,” Putin said in response to a question, adding that Russia would not use those weapons first. We have not gone crazy, we are aware of what nuclear weapons are. We have these means, and they are more advanced and more modern than those of any other nuclear country. As of today, this is an obvious fact. We are not going to wave these weapons around like a razor, running around the world, but of course we act with the understanding that they exist.” Vladimir Putin has admitted Russia’s war in Ukraine could turn into a “long-term process” as he sought to defend an invasion in which Russian troops have been forced to retreat and even airbases deep inside Russia have come under attack. Speaking to members of his personal human rights council on Wednesday, Putin claimed that Russia would not use nuclear weapons first in any conflict, denied that Russian troops were deserting en masse from the field of battle, and claimed he would not need to mobilise more troops, a process that has caused considerable upheaval in Russia. As for the slow process of the special military operation, then, of course, it can be a long-term process,” Putin said. But then you mentioned that new territories had appeared. This is such a significant result for Russia … The Azov Sea has become an internal Russian sea. Even Peter I had fought for access to the Azov Sea.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy reported “very fierce” fighting in the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut where Russian troops continue to strike the eastern Donetsk region. The US on Wednesday denounced “loose talk” on nuclear weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin mused on rising risks of nuclear war but said Moscow would not strike first. For any updates or feedback you wish to share, please feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter. If you have just joined us, here are all the latest developments: Russian shelling killed 10 people and wounded many others in the town of Kurakhove in eastern Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Kyiv’s mayor Vitali Klitschko warned of an “apocalypse” scenario for the city this winter if Russian airstrikes on infrastructure continue. Russia has fired more than 1,000 rockets and missiles at Ukraine’s power grid, Interfax Ukraine news agency said. President Vladimir Putin has said that Russia’s war in Ukraine could turn into a “long-term process”. Speaking to members of his personal human rights council on Wednesday, Putin sought to defend an invasion in which Russian troops have been forced to retreat and even airbases deep inside Russia have come under attack. Putin also claimed that Russia would not use nuclear weapons first in any conflict and denied that Russian troops were deserting en-mass from the field of battle. He claimed that the Russian military would not need to mobilise more troops, a process that has caused considerable upheaval in Russia. The risk of nuclear weapons being used in the Ukraine conflict has lessened thanks to international pressure on Russia, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in an interview published Thursday. “One thing has changed for the time being: Russia has stopped threatening to use nuclear weapons. In response to the international community marking a red line,” Scholz said in the interview with Germany’s Funke media group. Talks between Russia and the United States on securing an exchange of high-profile prisoners are making only sporadic progress, a top Russian diplomat said in comments published on Thursday. The two countries have been examining ways of conducting an exchange to enable jailed Americans Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan to go free. Moscow has made it known it would like convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout to be included in any deal. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Russia is attempting to “freeze” the fighting in Ukraine over the winter to prepare its forces for a renewed assault early next year. Stoltenberg urged Nato allies to continue sending weapons to Kyiv over the winter, adding that the conditions for a peaceful settlement to the war are “not there now”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said 31 “suspicious packages” had been sent to Ukrainian missions in 15 countries. In the past week, Ukraine says its embassies and consultants across Europe have received “bloody” packages, some containing animal eyes, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. A road accident in the temporarily occupied eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk has left 16 people dead and several injured, according to a Russian-backed official and state media. The accident involved a minibus and a truck, whose passengers included soldiers, and took place between Torez and Shakhtarsk, emergency services told the Russian state-owned news agency Tass. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, has called on the country’s western allies to boycott Russian culture. Writing in the Guardian, Tkachenko argues that a halt to performances of the music of Tchaikovsky and other Russian composers until the end of the war would be “pausing the performance of his works until Russia ceases its bloody invasion”. The European Commission has proposed a ninth package of sanctions on Russia, including adding almost 200 additional individuals and entities on the sanctions list. In a statement, the head of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, accused Russia of “deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure” and of continuing to “bring deaths and devastation to Ukraine”. The US has made clear to Ukraine its “concerns” about any escalation of the war with Russia, the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said. Kirby said the principle behind the war in Ukraine was one of sovereignty, and “unlike the Russians, we respect Ukrainian sovereignty”. Kirby’s comments came after Kyiv appeared to launch a pre-emptive strike on bombers on two Russian airbases far from the frontlines earlier this week. The Kremlin has said a US military aid spending bill providing $800m to Ukraine approved by lawmakers on Tuesday was “provocation towards our country”. The Fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, authorises the additional spending for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, an increase of $500m over President Joe Biden’s request earlier this year. Britain has ordered “several thousand” NLAW anti-tank weapons to replace the 7,000 donated to Ukraine in the past year. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said the NLAWs played “a decisive role” in pushing back the Russian invasion, but Labour has complained that the deal took nearly 10 months to sign and the replacements will take three years to make. BP should donate its “wartime profits” in Russia to the reconstruction of Ukraine or ministers should impose a special windfall tax on the oil company to force it to do so, British MPs have told parliament. The British oil supermajor has a 19.75% stake in Rosneft, one of the Kremlin’s most important oil assets and signalled its intent to exit Russia nine months ago, after Russia invaded Ukraine. At least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks of the war in Ukraine, according to a report by the UN’s human rights office. Many of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report by the Office of the high commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said. An Orthodox priest accused of leaking information on Ukrainian defence positions to Russia has been sentenced to 12 years in prison, according to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office. The priest from Lysychansk, in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, had been informing the Russians about the positions of Ukrainian troops since April, it said in a statement on Telegram."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/feb/07/energy-dashboard-how-electricity-generated-great-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-07T12:00:45Z","webTitle":"Energy mix: how is electricity generated in Great Britain?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/07/energy-dashboard-how-electricity-generated-great-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/feb/07/energy-dashboard-how-electricity-generated-great-britain","fields":{"bodyText":"Great Britain has one of the most diverse ranges of electricity generation in Europe, with everything from windfarms off the coast of Scotland to a nuclear power station in Suffolk tasked with keeping the lights on. The increasing reliance on renewable energy sources, as part of the country’s green ambitions, also means there can be rapid shifts in the main source of electricity generation. On windy days, most electricity generation comes from onshore and offshore windfarms. When conditions are cold and still, gas-fired power stations known as peaking plants are called into action. The electricity system in Great Britain relies on a combination of “baseload” power – from stable generators such as nuclear and biomass plants – and “intermittent” sources, such as wind and solar farms that need the right weather conditions to feed energy into the grid. National Grid also imports energy from overseas, through subsea cables known as interconnectors that link to France, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. They allow companies to trade excess power, such as renewable energy created by the sun, wind and water, between different countries. By 2030 it is hoped that 90% of the energy imported by interconnectors will be from zero carbon energy sources. The technology behind Great Britain’s power generation has evolved significantly over the last century. The first integrated national grid in the world was formed in 1935 linking seven regions of the UK. In the aftermath of industrialisation, coal provided the vast majority of power, before oil began to play an increasingly important part in the 1950s. In 1956, the world’s first commercial nuclear reactor, Calder Hall 1 at Windscale (later Sellafield), was opened by Queen Elizabeth II. Coal use fell significantly in the 1990s while the use of combined cycle gas turbines grew. Now a combination of gas, wind, nuclear and biomass provide the bulk of Great Britain’s energy, with smaller sources such as solar and hydroelectric power also used. From October 2024, coal will no longer be used to generate electricity. Methodology The charts visualise Great Britain’s electricity generation data. Northern Ireland has a separate energy market from the rest of the UK and is not included in the figures. Energy generation data is fetched from the Balancing Mechanism Reporting Service public feed, provided by Elexon – which runs the wholesale energy market – and is updated every five minutes. Elexon’s data does not include embedded energy, which is unmetered and therefore invisible to Great Britain’s National Grid. Embedded energy comprises all solar energy and wind energy generated from non-metered turbines. To account for these figures we use embedded energy estimates from the National Grid electricity system operator, which are published every 30 minutes. Import figures refer to the net flow of electricity from the interconnectors with Europe and with Northern Ireland. A positive value represents import into the GB transmission system, while a negative value represents an export. Hydro figures combine renewable run-of-the-river hydropower and pumped storage. Biomass figures include Elexon’s “other” category, which comprises coal-to-biomass conversions and biomass combined heat and power plants. The Guardian does not make any attempt to fix potential mistakes in the data feeds; all figures should be taken as indicative."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-bakhmut-remains-epicentre-of-combat-ukraine-says-brazils-lula-upset-not-to-meet-zelenskiy-at-g7","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T17:56:34Z","webTitle":"Bakhmut at ‘epicentre’ of combat, Kyiv says; Putin aware of claim ‘saboteurs’ attempted to enter Belgorod – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-bakhmut-remains-epicentre-of-combat-ukraine-says-brazils-lula-upset-not-to-meet-zelenskiy-at-g7","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-bakhmut-remains-epicentre-of-combat-ukraine-says-brazils-lula-upset-not-to-meet-zelenskiy-at-g7","fields":{"bodyText":"The blog has now wrapped for up today. Below is a round-up of today’s events. Anti-Kremlin militia claims to have overrun Russian border settlement in Belgorod. Fighting broke out along the Russian border with Ukraine after self-described Russian partisan forces launching a cross-border raid, claiming to have overrun a border settlement for the first time in the war. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been reconnected to the power grid after it was switched to standby and emergency power supply generators. Russia-installed local official in the Moscow-controlled part of the region Vladimir Rogov said the plant was “completely” disconnected from external power supply after Ukraine disconnected a power line it controls. 12 northern European countries met to discuss stepping up deterrence and security on Nato’s eastern flank and strengthening Ukraine’s defences. Defence ministers from the Northern Group met in Poland on Monday where talks described as “very good” by the Polish defence minister were focused on coordinating ways of providing security to countries in the group. Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer both reaffirmed their support for Ukraine in the UK’s House of Commons this afternoon. The Labour leader also noted that Labour “[welcomes] the decision by our partners on F-16 fighter jets” and said “whichever party is in power in the UK, there will be no letup in Britain’s resolve. We will continue to support Ukraine’s military and its people in its quest for freedom, peace and justice.” The Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said that Russian forces have begun demining operations in Bakhmut. Tass quotes him appearing on the Rossiya-24 TV channel and saying: “There is a preliminary demining of the city. It is important for us to carry out a complete, thorough demining. This is a very painstaking and difficult work, given the scale of the hostilities that took place there.” In another report, Tass quotes a source from the local Russian-imposed officials saying that “a few dozen more residents” remained in Bakhmut, but that “perhaps, the figure will change as the basements of houses are examined”. The source said that the “evacuation” of civilians continues. Ukrainian troops are still advancing on the flanks of the devastated city, although the “intensity” of their movement has decreased and Russia is bringing in more forces, Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Monday. She said that Ukraine had a small foothold inside the city itself, again denying Russia’s assertion that it has established full control over Bakhmut. Russian President Vladimir Putin had congratulated Wagner and Russian regular forces on “the completion of the operation to liberate Artemovsk [the city’s Soviet-era name]” after Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin posed among the wreckage, and said his mercenary group controlled the entire city at the weekend. It has not been possible for journalists to verify the battlefield situation in the city for months. At least eight people were wounded and scores of buildings were damaged in a Russian air attack on Dnipropetrovsk region. “The Russian invaders attacked military and infrastructure facilities of the eastern outpost of Ukraine – the city of Dnipro,” Ukraine’s air force said on the Telegram messaging service. “The attack was carried out by 16 different types of missiles and 20 Shahed-136/131 strike drones,” the air force said, adding that air defences brought down 20 Russian drones and four cruise missiles. At least one person was injured, and images from the city show destruction of emergency services equipment in what appears to have been a strike on a fire station. Russia’s ambassador to the US appears to have warned Washington that any strike on Crimea could be considered a strike on Russian territory by Nato after the US president, Joe Biden, said he would support training for Ukrainian pilots on US F-16 fighter jets. In remarks published on the embassy’s Telegram channel, Anatoly Antonov wrote: “I would like to warn representatives of the administration against thoughtless judgments on Crimea, especially in terms of ‘blessing’ the Kyiv regime for air attacks on the peninsula. Let me remind you that strikes on this territory are considered by us as an attack on any other region of the Russian Federation. It is important that the United States is fully aware of the Russian response.” The EU’s top diplomat will propose further sanctions against Russia, following a promise by G7 leaders to intensify western restrictions on Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said he hoped to soon present “concrete proposals to implement the decision of the G7 on new kinds of sanctions against Russia”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, has tweeted out his nightly address where he claims Ukraine’s air defence systems have shot down “25 out of 25” Russian drones between Sunday night and Monday morning. The Associated Press reports that defence ministers and senior officials from 12 northern European countries met in Poland on Monday to talk about stepping up deterrence and security on Nato’s eastern flank and strengthening Ukraine’s defences. They gathered near Warsaw as part of the Northern Group, a platform for developing security initiatives for Nato and European Union members. Members of the Northern Group include Britain, Germany, Poland and Finland. After the meeting, Poland’s defence minister, Mariusz Błaszczak, said the “very good” talks were focused on coordinating ways of providing security to countries in the group. He underscored good cooperation with Britain and Sweden, saying the two countries have similar views on threats coming from Russia as it wages war on Ukraine. “We are looking for joint solutions to ensure security,” Błaszczak said. He said Poland’s efforts to obtain early warning planes from Sweden were moving forward. Officials also discussed preparations for the July Nato summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, and Poland’s proposals for it, Błaszczak said. That summit is expected to gauge prospects for Ukraine’s membership. There have been eight injuries and no deaths as a result of the shelling in the Graivoronsky district in Belgorod, Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor for the region, has said during a live broadcast on the Russian social media network VKontakte. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the Belgorod governor, has introduced emergency counter-terrorism mesasures, according to this message on Telegram: “In order to ensure the safety of citizens in the Belgorod region, the legal regime of the counter-terrorist operation has been introduced today, which establishes special measures and temporary restrictions. “Starting with the verification of documents proving their identity and ending with the suspension of the activities of hazardous industries and organisations that use explosive, radioactive, chemically and biologically hazardous substances.” Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer have both reaffirmed their support for Ukraine in the UK’s House of Commons this afternoon. Starmer said: “As I told President Zelenskiy when I met him in Kyiv, whichever party is in power in the UK, there will be no letup in Britain’s resolve. We will continue to support Ukraine’s military and its people in its quest for freedom, peace and justice.” He also noted that Labour “[welcomes] the decision by our partners on F-16 fighter jets”. Starmer also urged the prime minister to proscribe the Wagner group as terrorists and “to ensure Britain’s sanctions are not just in place, but enforced”. Speaking beforehand, Sunak said: “When Putin launched his war he gambled that our resolve would falter, but he was wrong then and he is wrong now. “Russia’s military is failing on the battlefield; their economy is failing at home as we tighten the stranglehold on sanctions; and the image of the G7 leaders standing shoulder to shoulder with President Zelenskiy in Hiroshima sent a powerful message to the world: we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.” “Putin should know that we are not going anywhere.” The Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya has accused the country’s president, Alexander Lukashenko, of personally ordering the illegal transfer of Ukrainian orphans and suggested he may be guilty of war crimes. Tsikhanouskaya, who lives in exile in Lithuania, said “ample evidence” had been gathered indicating the “direct involvement” of Lukashenko and his regime in the deportation of Ukrainian children from territories occupied by Russia to Belarus. “Alexander Lukashenko personally ordered the transfers of orphans to Belarus and facilitated their arrival by financial and organisational support,” states a report Tsikhanouskaya sent to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and EU foreign ministers. Tsikhanouskaya’s team estimates that at least 2,150 children will have been brought to Belarus by the end of this month. Some have been sent to the Dubrava camp in the Minsk region, which is said to be run by Belaruskali, a state-owned potash company and major source of revenue for the Lukashenko regime. The charge sheet against Lukashenko and Belaruskali comes amid growing pressure on the EU to tighten up sanctions against Belarus. The EU has already imposed sanctions on Belarus, including Belaruskali, both for its role in supporting the Russian invasion and the brutal crackdown on protesters after the 2020 elections. However, an extension of the sanctions has been held up for months over the question of whether Belaruskali should be granted an exemption in the name of food security. The European Commission had proposed an exemption for Belaruskali in a belief it would ease global food shortages. Lithuania, backed by Poland, Estonia and Hungary, is refusing to sign off sanctions if an exemption for Belaruskali is included. Vilnius argues that the market is adapting to provide alternatives to Belarusian potash. “It’s our duty not to fall into the trap of Russian propaganda. No lack of fertilisers [and] sanctions against Russia doesn’t cause food insecurity,” the Lithuanian foreign ministry tweeted on Monday. Andrew Roth, the Guardian’s Moscow correspondent, has this roundup of what we know so far about the incident on Belgorod: Fighting has broken out along the Russian border with Ukraine after self-described Russian partisan forces launched a cross-border raid and claimed to have overrun a border settlement for the first time in the war. The Freedom of Russia Legion, which describes itself as an anti-Kremlin militia seeking to overthrow the Kremlin and liberate Russia from Vladimir Putin, claimed to have crossed the border and overrun the settlement of Kozinka, while sending units into the town of Grayvoron in Russia’s Belgorod region. Any capture of territory has not been independently confirmed by journalists on the ground. The militia has mostly existed on social media and it is not known to have participated in any major battles during the war. But both Russia and Ukrainian officials have confirmed fighting at the border and social media video has shown armoured vehicles appearing to overrun a Russian border post near Grayvoron. “We are the same Russians as you,” said a statement put out by the group on social media. “We are distinguished only by the fact that we no longer wanted to justify the actions of criminals in power and took up arms to defend our and your freedom. But today it’s time for everyone to take responsibility for their future. It’s time to put an end to the Kremlin’s dictatorship.” Other video posted to social media showed a Russian Mi-8 helicopter trailing flares over the town of Kozinka and videos of smoke rising from the settlement with the sounds of emergency sirens clearly audible. The governor of the Belgorod region confirmed an attack on Monday, writing that “sabotage and reconnaissance group of the armed forces of Ukraine have entered the territory of the Grayvoron district. The armed forces of the Russian Federation, together with the border service, Rosgvardiya and the FSB, are taking the necessary measures to eliminate the enemy.” Ukraine has disavowed connection to the Russian partisan fighters, saying that they act independently and are not subject to military control. The head of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, has posted another update to Telegram about the outbreak of fighting inside Russia. He wrote: There are three more victims in Grayvoron – two men and one woman with shrapnel wounds, they are in the hospital in a state of moderate severity. All necessary medical assistance is provided. The shells also damaged three private residential buildings, as a result of which they caught fire. There is also a hit on the administration building. In the village of Zamostye, a shell hit a kindergarten, causing it to catch fire. There is also an injured woman with a hand wound, assistance was provided on the spot. Damage information is being updated. Here is what Russian state-owned media Tass is reporting as what it knows about events in Belgorod: The head of the Belgorod region Vyacheslav Gladkov reported about the penetration of Ukrainian saboteurs into the Grayvoron district. He clarified that the Russian military, border guards, as well as employees of the National Guard and the FSB are taking “the necessary measures to eliminate the enemy.” Prior to this, the governor reported two victims of shelling in the village of Glotovo, Graivoronsky district. According to him, a woman with mine-explosive wounds was taken to intensive care in a serious condition, the man’s condition is assessed as moderate. Later, the Kremlin confirmed that a Ukrainian sabotage group tried to break into the Belgorod region, now it is being squeezed out of Russian territory and destroyed. There are enough forces and means on the spot to fight saboteurs, Dmitry Peskov, press secretary of the president of the Russian Federation, told reporters. He clarified that Putin was informed about the incident. Peskov said that the purpose of the sabotage was “to divert attention from the Bakhmut direction, to minimize the political effect of the loss. Christopher Miller, covering the conflict for the FT, has suggested on Twitter that “Ukrainian incursions into poorly defended Russian settlements along the border could be part of the counteroffensive strategy to keep the Kremlin off balance.” The situation in Belgorod region remains unclear. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, has published on its Telegram channel what it says is a message from the Freedom of Russia Legion. They claim to be participating in an attack inside the Russian Federation’s borders. Suspilne writes: “The situation is difficult” in the Belgorod region, the press service of the Freedom of Russia Legion informed us. They said that the Legion and Russian Volunteer Corps are creating a demilitarized zone on the border with the Russian Federation, from where the Russian army will not be able to fire at Ukraine. According to them, they will continue to “move towards the liberation of all of Russia.” The Kremlin has claimed that Ukraine is behind the incursion. Ukrainian officials have denied this. The Washington Post is reporting that the UN nuclear watchdog is pushing for a last-minute agreement to safeguard Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant ahead of any counteroffensive. The report comes after the plant lost external power today for the seventh time during the conflict. The Post says that the plan being pushed by the director general of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, has five main points: According to two diplomats familiar with the negotiations, Grossi’s plan includes five principles: a ban on stationing heavy military equipment and military personnel at the plant; a ban on firing from and toward the plant, including a ban on attacking the personnel at the site; protection of all safety and security systems at the plant; protection of all external power lines; and monitoring of compliance of the above-mentioned principles. The Post notes that this appears to be less ambitious than Grossi’s previous proposal of a protection zone around the plant. The plant has been under Russian occupation since the earliest days of the war, and the Russian Federation has claimed to annex the Zaporizhzhia region, despite not fully controlling the territory. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of president of Ukraine, has distanced Ukraine from events in Belgorod, where there are reports of an armed incursion into Russian territory. He wrote on Twitter: The only driving political force in a totalitarian country of tightened screws is always an armed guerrilla movement. Ukraine is watching the events in the Belgorod region of Russia with interest and studying the situation, but it has nothing to do with it. As you know, tanks are sold at any Russian military store, and underground guerrilla groups are composed of Russian citizens. The Kremlin has accused Ukraine of staging an incursion to distract from the Russian claim to have seized full control of Bakhmut at the weekend. Here are some pictures of the destruction caused overnight by what Ukraine claims were Russian strikes in Dnipro city in south-eastern Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian army, Russian forces targeted the Dnipro with 16 missiles and 20 attack drones. The Russian state-owned Tass news agency has reported on its Telegram feed that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has been informed about what is claimed to be an attempt to infiltrate the Belgorod region by Ukrainian forces. Citing Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, it posted: The ministry of defence, the FSB and the border service reported to Putin about an attempt by Ukrainian saboteurs to break into the Belgorod region, Peskov said. The purpose of the Ukrainian sabotage in the Belgorod region is to divert attention from the situation in the Bakhmut direction, he noted. Russian forces are working to squeeze out the Ukrainian saboteur group from the territory of the Russian Federation and destroy it. There are enough forces and means, the press secretary of the president of the Russian Federation added. Reuters reports that Ukraine’s military intelligence service has blamed an armed operation in Belgorod on Russian citizens belonging to two paramilitary groups, Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske said. It quoted military intelligence spokesperson Andriy Yusov as saying the Freedom of Russia Legion and Russian Volunteer Corps were responsible for the operation. Tass identified the territory of the Graivoronsky district as the location for the incident. None of the claims have been independently verified. Reuters reports that Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Russia’s Belgorod region, claimed on Monday that a Ukrainian army “sabotage group” had entered Russian territory in the Graivoron district, which borders Ukraine. On Telegram, Gladkov claimed the Russian army and security forces were taking measures to fight off the incursion. “A sabotage and reconnaissance group of the armed forces of Ukraine has entered the territory of the Graivoronsky district. The Russian armed forces, together with the border service, the Russian guard and the FSB, are taking the necessary measures to eliminate the enemy. I will report the details,” he said. Reuters reports that Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the private Russian army Wagner, repeated his vow to pull his troops out of Bakhmut in three days, and hand over the defence of the newly captured city to regular troops. “On the western edges, defensive positions have been set up, and so Wagner will be leaving Artyomovsk between 25 May and 1 June,” he said, using the Soviet-era name for Bakhmut. “If the Defence Ministry’s own forces aren’t enough, then we have thousands of generals – we just need to put together a battalion of generals, give them all guns, and it’ll all be fine.” Prigozhin has been a vocal critic of the army and defence establishment support that his Wagner mercenaries have received. Moscow’s defence ministry acknowledged that some Russian troops fell back outside Bakhmut last week, but has denied Prigozhin’s repeated assertion that the flanks were crumbling, or that the military had withheld ammunition from Wagner. Energoatom, Ukraine’s state-owned enterprise for the nation’s nuclear power plants, has released a statement on the restoration of power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Ukrainian experts restored the operation of the Dniprovsk 750 kV high-voltage power transmission line, from which the temporarily occupied ZNPP supplies its own needs. The risk of a nuclear and radiation accident is minimised, the situation is stable. We will remind you that on the morning of 22 May, at 5.26am, this line was disconnected as a result of Russian shelling. Since it is the last one that powers the ZNPP, all backup diesel generators are automatically turned on. As a result, the station experienced a blackout for the seventh time since the beginning of the occupation. Earlier one of the Russian-installed leaders of the partially occupied Zaporizhzhia region claimed it had been Ukraine who had disconnected the power plant. The claims have not been independently verified. Lars Løkke Rasmussen, the Danish foreign minister says his nation remains open to the idea of giving F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, but no firm position has been arrived at. Rasmussen said: “It doesn’t make sense to train someone to fly a plane if you’ve decided in advance that they can never, ever be allowed to fly the plane. On the other hand, you cannot conclude from this that we have made a decision to donate aircraft.” This follows on from comments earlier this morning where Rasmussen said his nation would like to host a summit in July about finding peace between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence appeared to gave a pictorial response to the proposed peace summit, tweeting a picture of a fighter jet superimposed over a peace symbol, with the caption “Ukraine’s Peace Formula” • This post was amended on 22 May 2023. An earlier version mistakenly identified Rasmussen as the Dutch foreign minister. The Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said that Russian forces have begun demining operations in Bakhmut. Tass quotes him appearing on the Rossiya-24 TV channel and saying: “There is a preliminary demining of the city. It is important for us to carry out a complete, thorough demining. This is a very painstaking and difficult work, given the scale of the hostilities that took place there.” In another report, Tass quotes a source from the local Russian-imposed officials saying that “a few dozen more residents” remained in Bakhmut, but that “perhaps, the figure will change as the basements of houses are examined”. The source said that the “evacuation” of civilians continues. Ukrainian troops are still advancing on the flanks of the devastated city, although the “intensity” of their movement has decreased and Russia is bringing in more forces, Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Monday. She said that Ukraine had a small foothold inside the city itself, again denying Russia’s assertion that it has established full control over Bakhmut. Russian President Vladimir Putin had congratulated Wagner and Russian regular forces on “the completion of the operation to liberate Artemovsk [the city’s Soviet-era name]” after Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin posed among the wreckage, and said his mercenary group controlled the entire city at the weekend. It has not been possible for journalists to verify the battlefield situation in the city for months. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been reconnected to the power grid after it was switched to standby and emergency power supply generators. Russia-installed local official in the Moscow-controlled part of the region Vladimir Rogov said the plant was “completely” disconnected from external power supply after Ukraine disconnected a power line it controls. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has said the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) “cannot continue”. At least eight people were wounded and scores of buildings were damaged in a Russian air attack on Dnipropetrovsk region. “The Russian invaders attacked military and infrastructure facilities of the eastern outpost of Ukraine – the city of Dnipro,” Ukraine’s air force said on the Telegram messaging service. “The attack was carried out by 16 different types of missiles and 20 Shahed-136/131 strike drones,” the air force said, adding that air defences brought down 20 Russian drones and four cruise missiles.

Let me remind you that strikes on this territory are considered by us as an attack on any other region of the Russian Federation. It is important that the United States is fully aware of the Russian response.” Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of president of Ukraine, has said “Crimea is an indisputable and inseparable part of Ukraine. It was, it is and it will be. The liberation of Crimea using any military force and means is the only rational way to stop ‘Russian aggressions’ and bring the world back to international law. It is Ukraine’s direct obligation and necessity today” The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region has claimed on Telegram that an explosive device dropped from an unmanned aerial vehicle in Novaya Tavolzhanka, without causing any injuries. The governor of Russia’s Bryansk region has claimed this morning that Ukraine has shelled a village. The EU’s top diplomat will propose further sanctions against Russia, following a promise by G7 leaders to intensify western restrictions on Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said he hoped to soon present “concrete proposals to implement the decision of the G7 on new kinds of sanctions against Russia”. Citing Kharkiv’s regional governor, Oleh Synyehubov, Suspilne is reporting that two women have been hospitalised after shelling on Kupiansk. It reports “private houses and civil infrastructure were damaged in the city”. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that the external power supply to Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) has been restored, after an earlier outage forced the plant to rely on emergency diesel generators. It posted to Telegram: Energy workers have restored the power transmission line that feeds the ZNPP. The station is switching to power from the Ukrainian energy system, Ukrenergo reported. Finland’s state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum said on Monday it had terminated a contract to buy natural gas from Gazprom Export via pipelines from Russia. Reuters reports Gazprom ceased pipeline-based natural gas deliveries to Gasum in May 2022 in a dispute over payments, and the two sides had been in talks to resolve the matter. Gazprom demanded that European countries pay for Russian gas supplies in roubles because of sanctions imposed over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, which Finland refused to do. Reuters reports Denmark’s foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen has said his nation would like to host a summit in July about how to find peace between Ukraine and Russia, citing the Ritzau news agency. The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region has claimed on Telegram that an explosive device dropped from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in Novaya Tavolzhanka. Vyacheslav Gladkov posted: In Novaya Tavolzhanka, an explosive device was dropped from a drone next to a private residential building. There were no casualties or damage. The UAV itself fell 100 metres from residential buildings. Explosives and operational services are working on the spot. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukrainian troops are still advancing on the flanks of the devastated city of Bakhmut, although the “intensity” of their movement has decreased and Russia is bringing in more forces, Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Monday. Reuters reports she said, in televised comments, that Ukraine had a small foothold inside the city itself, again denying Russia’s assertion that it has established full control over Bakhmut. The claims have not been independently verified. The Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said that Russian forces have begun demining operations in Bakhmut. Tass quotes him appearing on the Rossiya-24 TV channel and saying: There is a preliminary demining of the city. It is important for us to carry out a complete, thorough demining. This is a very painstaking and difficult work, given the scale of the hostilities that took place there. In another report, Tass quotes a source from the local Russian-imposed officials saying that “a few dozen more residents” remained in Bakhmut, but that “perhaps, the figure will change as the basements of houses are examined”. The source said that the “evacuation” of civilians continues. Russian sources refer to Bakhmut by its Soviet-era name Artemovsk. Jennifer Rankin reports from Brussels for the Guardian: The EU’s top diplomat will propose further sanctions against Russia, following a promise by G7 leaders to intensify western restrictions on Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said he hoped to soon present “concrete proposals to implement the decision of the G7 on new kinds of sanctions against Russia”. Meeting in Hiroshima over the weekend, leaders of the west’s seven largest economies, plus the heads of the European Commission and Council, pledged to “starve Russia of G7 technology, industrial equipment and services that support its war machine”. Significantly, they also promised to reduce reliance on civil nuclear goods from Russia and to restrict the trade in diamonds mined, processed or produced in Russia. Nuclear power and diamonds have increasingly been seen as no-go areas for EU sanctions, because of objections from Hungary and Belgium respectively. Hungary, which has signed a contract with Rosatom to build nuclear reactors, has repeatedly threatened to veto any nuclear sanctions, while Belgium, home to one of the world’s largest diamond trading hubs, has used more subtle diplomacy to get the precious stones off EU sanctions lists. The Belgian government argues that an international agreement to stop Russian stones being traded elsewhere in the world is necessary, rather than unilateral EU action. Borrell did not mention any specific sector in his comments. The promise to implement the G7 text comes as EU27 member states continue to spar over the current sanctions proposals, largely aimed at clamping down on companies and countries that help Moscow dodge western measures. Sweden’s foreign minister, Tobias Billström, said talks were well under way and he was confident of an eventual agreement, despite Hungary’s threats to block the latest proposals. Earlier we reported remarks published on the Russian embassy in Washington’s Telegram channel by ambassador Anatoly Antonov, in which he appeared to draw a separate line between attacks on Crimea and attacks on the four regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation claimed to annex last year. He said: I would like to warn representatives of the administration against thoughtless judgments on Crimea, especially in terms of “blessing” the Kyiv regime for air attacks on the peninsula. Let me remind you that strikes on this territory are considered by us as an attack on any other region of the Russian Federation. It is important that the United States is fully aware of the Russian response. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of president of Ukraine, appears to have retorted to that this morning in a tweet, saying: Crimea is an indisputable and inseparable part of Ukraine. It was, it is and it will be. The liberation of Crimea using any military force and means is the only rational way to stop “Russian aggressions” and bring the world back to international law. It is Ukraine’s direct obligation and necessity today … The governor of Russia’s Bryansk region has claimed this morning that Ukraine has shelled a village. In a message on Telegram, Alexander Bogomaz said: The armed forces of Ukraine fired mortars at the village of Khoromnoe in the Klimovsky district. There were no casualties. As a result of the shelling, one household and an outbuilding caught fire. Operational and emergency services are on site. Bryansk region is to the north of Ukraine, and shares its borders with Ukraine and Belarus. The claims have not been independently verified. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has said the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) “cannot continue”. In a tweet, he wrote: Ukraine’s ZNPP this morning lost all external electricity for seventh time during conflict, forcing it to rely on emergency diesel generators for power; nuclear safety situation at the plant extremely vulnerable. We must agree to protect plant now; this situation cannot continue. The Kyiv Post is carrying a video clip which it claims shows damage to one of the fire stations in Dnipro which appears to have been targeted in an overnight attack. Oliver Carroll, foreign correspondent at the Economist, has tweeted one of the images released from the scene, observing “Russia may have targeted emergency services in missile attacks on Dnipro last night. Local authorities reporting massive damage in one of the stations - more than 20 vehicles destroyed.” Other images released by officials in Ukraine show several views of the damage. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians or civilian infrastructure since it began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The former commander of joint forces command Richard Barrons has been on Sky News in the UK, and he was asked what difference sending F-16 planes could make to Ukraine’s war effort. He told viewers: It is a very complex fourth generation aircraft will give Ukraine a decisive advantage over the Russian air force and indeed, over Russian ground forces if they get to the right threshold of capability, and have the family of ammunition that make the aircraft so effective. It would turn the battle in the skies in favour of Ukraine when Ukraine has enough of aircraft, enough competence with it and enough of the family of missiles that make it effective. There’s not much wrong with [the Ukrainian air force], it is certainly full of spirit. But it’s aircraft are mostly Russian aircraft, and therefore well known to the Russians. So they’ve not been able to throw the Russian air force out of the skies, and they’ve relied very heavily on their ground air defences. F-16s will give them the ability to take Ukraine air power over Russian forces in Ukraine. That will be a gamechanger. However, Barrons stressed it was not a short-term project. We should recognise that F-16s will take about 18 months to become combat effective in Ukraine. So what this signals is an expectation on the part of the G7 and others and President Zelenskiy that whatever the outcome of the offensive they’re about to mount, this war will go on into next year. Here is an update on the situation overnight in the Dnipropetrovsk region, where Ukraine says at least eight people were wounded and scores of buildings were damaged in a Russian air attack. “The Russian invaders attacked military and infrastructure facilities of the eastern outpost of Ukraine – the city of Dnipro,” Ukraine’s air force said on the Telegram messaging service. “The attack was carried out by 16 different types of missiles and 20 Shahed-136/131 strike drones,” the air force said, adding that air defences brought down 20 Russian drones and four cruise missiles. At least one man was wounded in the attack on Dnipro city and seven people were injured on an attack on Synelnykivskyi district of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Reuters reports the governor, Serhiy Lysak, said on Telegram. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com A picture is worth a thousand words and the images from the G7 summit in Hiroshima this weekend were a good example of that. Volodymyr Zelenskiy was pictured at the centre of a “family portrait” with G7 leaders at the weekend, symbolising their support for the Ukrainian president. Just less than 10 years ago the G7 was the G8 – when Russia was a member of the group and president Vladimir Putin attended summits. Moscow was kicked out in 2014 after the invasion of Crimea. Other pictures showed Zelenskiy being hugged by French president Emmanuel Macron, US president Joe Biden with his arm around him, and sharing smiles and handshakes with other leaders including Canada’s Justin Trudeau and the UK’s Rishi Sunak. More on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, with Ukraine’s state-owned power generating company Energoatom confirming that it has experienced a power outage. “Yes, we have the seventh blackout since the start of the [Russian] occupation,” Energoatom told Reuters. Yuriy Malashko, the governor of the Zaporizhzhia region in Ukraine, said there was a fire at one of the facilities in Zaporizhzhia city due to an overload in the power system. “Problems with electricity supply that arose in the city of Zaporizhzhia are not related to shelling,” Malashko said on the Telegram messaging app. Russia’s ambassador to the US appears to have warned Washington that any strike on Crimea could be considered a strike on Russian territory by Nato after US president Joe Biden said he would support training for Ukrainian pilots on US F-16 fighter jets. In remarks published on the embassy’s Telegram channel, Anatoly Antonov wrote: So far Washington is opposing us … by proxy. However, every specialist knows that there is no infrastructure for the use of F-16s in Ukraine, and the required number of pilots and maintenance personnel is not there either. What would happen if American fighters take off from Nato airfields, operated by foreign ‘volunteers’? I would like to warn representatives of the administration against thoughtless judgments on Crimea, especially in terms of “blessing” the Kiev regime for air attacks on the peninsula. Let me remind you that strikes on this territory are considered by us as an attack on any other region of the Russian Federation. It is important that the United States is fully aware of the Russian response. Volodymyr Zelenskiy stole the show at the G7 summit, Patrick Wintour writes in his analysis of the weekend, with Zelenskiy’s whirlwind round of diplomacy the culmination of a Ukrainian realisation that for months they have been talking to wrong people. Yes, it is essential to keep lines constantly open to Ukraine’s invested allies in the west, reaping the rewards such as Joe Biden’s decision finally to lift his veto on Ukrainian pilots training to fly US-made F-16 fighter aircraft, but the identification of the west with Ukraine’s cause is almost complete. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, ended her remarks by saying “Slava Ukrajni – Glory to Europe”. But Ukraine for months has known it is not telling its story clearly enough to the phalanx of 40 or so nonaligned states that have abstained at successive UN general assembly votes on the war. India, Brazil, China and as many as 20 African states have sat on the sidelines in the key votes. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been switched to standby and emergency power supply generators, a Russia-installed local official in the Moscow-controlled part of the region says.. Vladimir Rogov said the plant was “completely” disconnected from external power supply after Ukraine disconnected a power line it controls, Reuters reports. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine, but Anatoliy Kurtev, Zaporizhzhia city council’s secretary in Ukraine, said that work was ongoing since early Monday to restore power to the city. “(The power) partially disappeared in Zaporizhzhia due to an emergency situation at one of the energy facilities,” Kurtev said on the Telegram messaging app. Explosions were heard in the city of Dnipro overnight as well as in Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv, with a nationwide air raid alert activated at 3.48am, according to the Kyiv Independent. The city of Odesa was also reportedly hit by Russian combat drones late on Sunday. In a Telegram post, the governor of Dnipro, Serhiy Lysak, said: “Thanks to the defence forces, we withstood the attack.” He later said 15 drones and four cruise missiles had been shot down over the region, while eight people had been injured, including three taken to hospital. Dozens of vehicles were destroyed or damaged as well as nine apartment buildings, several private homes, shops, a kindergarten and administrative buildings, he said. Ukraine’s armed forces have sent a series of photos from Bakhmut, which show some of the extent of the city’s destruction. At the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, “I’ll tell you openly: photographs of ruined Hiroshima absolutely remind me of Bakhmut and other similar settlements. Nothing left alive, all the buildings ruined.” Fighting is continuing in Bakhmut, Ukraine’s armed forces have said in their morning update after Russia claimed to have completed the “liberation” of the eastern city over the weekend. Confusion has reigned as Ukrainian officials rejected the claims. “[In Bakhmut] the enemy continues to lead offensive actions. Fighting for the city of Bakhmut continues,” the armed forces said, adding that over the past day Russian forces had “unsuccessfully tried to recover lost positions south of the [nearby] settlement of Ivanivske”. Russia had also carried out air strikes on Bakhmut. It has been impossible to verify the conflicting statements over the devastated city, which has assumed symbolic importance as a measure of which side has the resilience to prevail in the war overall. Here’s our full report on the back-and-forth by Peter Beaumont and Julian Borger: Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has said he is “upset” that he and Volodymyr Zelenskiy did not meet at the G7 summit, adding his Ukrainian counterpart seemed uninterested in negotiating peace with Russia. AFP reports: Zelenskiy, who emerged from the summit in Hiroshima with fresh diplomatic support and pledges of more military aid, had sought a one-on-one meeting with Lula, who has faced accusations of being soft on Russia over its invasion. Both leaders said scheduling conflicts had prevented them from meeting – which Zelenskiy quipped had likely left his Brazilian counterpart “disappointed”. “I wasn’t disappointed. I was upset, because I’d like to meet him and discuss the matter,” Lula told a news conference before heading home from Japan. But “Zelenskiy is a grown-up. He knows what he’s doing,” he added. Lula said his team had scheduled a meeting with Zelenskiy for Sunday afternoon. But the Ukrainian leader ran late, and his own agenda was full after that, he said. Lula said he did not see a point in meeting Zelenskiy now, saying neither he nor Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to want peace. “For now, they’re both convinced they’re going to win the war,” he said. Lula is pushing for peace talks and has proposed Brazil as a mediator, along with other “neutral” countries, including China and Indonesia. But the veteran leftist faced criticism last month when he accused the United States of “encouraging” the war. After the White House accused him of “parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda”, Lula toned down his rhetoric, saying Brazil condemned Russia’s invasion. But he renewed his criticism Monday. US president Joe Biden, he said, is sending the message that “Putin has to surrender and pay for everything he wrecked”. “That message isn’t helping,” he said. Hello, welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Helen Livingstone and I’ll be bringing you the latest. Bakhmut and the nearby Donetsk city of Marinka remain the “epicentre” of the conflict, Ukraine’s armed forces have said in their morning update, a day after Russia claimed it had completed its “liberation” of the ruined city. “[In Bakhmut] the enemy continues to lead offensive actions. Fighting for the city of Bakhmut continues,” the armed forces said, adding that over the past day Russia had “unsuccessfully tried to recover lost positions south of the [nearby] settlement of Ivanivske”. Confusion has reigned over the situation in Bakhmut after the Russian claim, which cannot be verified independently. Ukrainian officials said they still had a foothold in the city and were encircling it, while Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said at a G7 summit in Hiroshima on Sunday: “Bakhmut is not occupied by Russian Federation as of today. There are no two or three interpretations of this.” Here are other recent developments: Zelenskiy secured fresh military aid from the US during a day of frantic diplomatic activity at the G7 summit. US president Joe Biden announced military assistance worth up to $375m (£300m) to Kyiv, telling Zelenskiy the US was doing everything possible to strengthen Ukraine’s defence. The package includes ammunition, artillery, armoured vehicles and training. Biden told a press conference that he had received a “flat assurance” from Zelenskiy that he would not use western-provided F-16 fighter jets to go into Russian territory. Biden said F-16 warplanes could, however, be used “wherever Russian troops are within Ukraine and the area”. Biden told G7 leaders that Washington supports joint allied training programs for Ukrainian pilots on F-16s warplanes, although Kyiv has not won specific, public commitments for delivery of the fighter jets. In a G7 speech, Zelenskiy said Kyiv’s plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine was “an obvious expression of rationality”, and sought support for his “peace formula”. He thanked western leaders for achieving “a level of cooperation which ensures that democracy, international law, and freedom are respected”, but questioned: “Is this enough?” Zelenskiy played down the fact he did not meet Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on the sidelines of the summit, saying it was likely because of scheduling. Lula has said Zelenskiy and Putin bear equal responsibility for the war and accused western powers of encouraging the conflict. Russia’s foreign ministry dismissed the G7 summit in Japan as a “politicised” event which it said had pumped out anti-Russian and anti-Chinese statements. In a statement posted on Telegram, the Russian foreign ministry said the G7 had “irreversibly deteriorated” and that the forum had become “an ‘incubator’ where, under the leadership of the Anglo-Saxons, destructive initiatives that undermine global stability are prepared”. Berlin police have opened an investigation into the suspected poisoning of two Russian journalists visiting the city for a conference last month organised by the Russian Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The probe comes after Russian investigative media group Agentsvo wrote that the two women had reported symptoms that pointed to possible poisoning around the time of the event at the end of April. The head of Russia’s Security Council Nikolai Patrushev will hold talks on Monday with Chen Wenqing, member of the Chinese Communist party’s politburo who oversees police, legal affairs and intelligence, the Russian RIA state news reported. Patrushev, a former chief of the FSB internal security service, is widely seen as one of the most hawkish members of Putin’s inner circle."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/may/30/risk-of-extinction-by-ai-should-be-global-priority-say-tech-experts","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-30T17:10:36Z","webTitle":"Risk of extinction by AI should be global priority, say experts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/30/risk-of-extinction-by-ai-should-be-global-priority-say-tech-experts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/may/30/risk-of-extinction-by-ai-should-be-global-priority-say-tech-experts","fields":{"bodyText":"A group of leading technology experts from across the world have warned that artificial intelligence technology should be considered a societal risk and prioritised in the same class as pandemics and nuclear wars. The statement, signed by hundreds of executives and academics, was released by the Center for AI Safety on Tuesday amid growing concerns over regulation and risks the technology posed to humanity. “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war,” the statement said. Signatories included the chief executives of Google’s DeepMind, the ChatGPT developer OpenAI, and the AI startup Anthropic. Global leaders and industry experts – such as the leaders of OpenAI – have made calls for regulation of the technology owing to existential fears it could significantly affect job markets, harm the health of millions and weaponise disinformation, discrimination and impersonation. This month the man often touted as the godfather of AI – Geoffrey Hinton, also a signatory – quit Google citing its “existential risk”. The risk was echoed and acknowledged by No 10 last week for the first time – a swift change of tack within government that came two months after publishing an AI white paper industry figures have warned is already out of date. While the letter published on Tuesday is not the first, it is potentially the most impactful given its wider range of signatories and its core existential concern, according to Michael Osborne, a professor in machine learning at the University of Oxford and co-founder of Mind Foundry. “It really is remarkable that so many people signed up to this letter,” he said. “That does show that there is a growing realisation among those of us working in AI that existential risks are a real concern.” AI’s potential to exacerbate existing existential risks such as engineered pandemics and military arms races are concerns that led Osborne to sign the public letter, along with AI’s novel existential threats. Calls to curb threats follow the success of ChatGPT, which launched in November. The language model has been widely adopted by millions of people and rapidly advanced beyond predictions by those best informed in the industry. Osborne said: “Because we don’t understand AI very well there is a prospect that it might play a role as a kind of new competing organism on the planet, so a sort of invasive species that we’ve designed that might play some devastating role in our survival as a species.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/06/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-blowing-up-nova-kakhovka-dam-near-kherson","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-06T21:10:10Z","webTitle":"Thousands flee homes as collapse of dam is blamed on Russian forces","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/06/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-blowing-up-nova-kakhovka-dam-near-kherson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/06/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-blowing-up-nova-kakhovka-dam-near-kherson","fields":{"bodyText":"Thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes and an ecological disaster has been unleashed on southern Ukraine by the collapse of a major hydroelectric dam on the Dnipro River, which Kyiv said was blown up by Russia in a desperate attempt to ward off a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, declared the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam an “environmental bomb of mass destruction” and said only liberating the entire country could guarantee against new “terrorist” acts. He blamed Russian occupying forces, which have had control of the dam and the adjacent town since last year’s full-scale invasion. “It is physically impossible to blow it up somehow from the outside, by shelling. It was mined by the Russian occupiers. And they blew it up,” Zelenskiy tweeted. “This is the largest man-made environmental disaster in Europe in decades.” Satellite images of the dam in the days leading up to the collapse showed it was in a worsening state. A picture from Monday this week showed part of the roadway along the top missing and apparent damage to at least one sluice gate below. CNN reported that analysis of other, lower-resolution imagery suggested the damage had occurred between 1 and 2 June. On Tuesday, damage turned to catastrophic failure. Aerial footage showed the dam missing a broad mid-section with the reservoir behind, which had been at record levels, pouring over it and roaring downstream. Towns along its path were inundated, complete houses could be seen floating away in the waters, while pets and wild animals scrambled to survive. The governor of the Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said about 16,000 people were in the “critical zone” on the Ukrainian-controlled right bank of the river. He said people were being evacuated and would be taken by bus to Kherson city and then by train to Mykolaiv and other Ukrainian cities, including Khmelnytskyi, Odesa, Kropyvnytskyi and Kyiv. In Kherson city, the water level rose over 3 metres over the course of Tuesday, and by mid afternoon was still rising by 6cm to 8cm every half hour in low-lying areas, according to hydrologist Larysa Musian, who was taking depth measurements on a Kherson street corner. Relief workers on the right bank of the river had to work under fire. “The biggest difficulty right now is not the water. It’s the Russians on the other side of the river who are shelling us now with artillery,” said Andrew Negrych, who was coordinating relief efforts for a US charity, Global Empowerment Mission. In Nova Kakhovka, all the animals except ducks and geese drowned, according to the animal welfare organisation Uanimals. “We tried hard to preserve the zoo during the occupation and now it no longer exists,” the group quoted the zoo management as saying. The disaster will have damaging effects that could last for generations, from the immediate potential for loss of life to the thousands of people forced to abandon their homes and farms. It is expected to have a catastrophic effect on the ecology of the region and will sweep mines from the banks of the Dnipro into villages and farmland downstream. It also robs Ukraine of long-term capacity for generating hydroelectric power. The loss of the upstream reservoir threatens water supplies to the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions and Crimea, and has long-term implications for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant 120 miles (200km) upstream. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian presidential administration, said the hydroelectric plant and dam had been blown up at 2.50am local time (0050 BST) on Tuesday. “Both constructions are located in the temporary Russian-occupied territories,” Yermak told the Guardian. “Neither shelling nor any other external influence was capable of destroying the structures. The explosion came from within.” The Ukrainian hydroelectric power corporation said the dam had been destroyed by a bomb placed in one of the turbine halls on top of it. The dam collapse happened on the second day of Ukrainian offensive operations likely to mark the early stages of a mass counteroffensive. It could affect any Ukrainian plans for an amphibious assault across the river. “The purpose is obvious: to create insurmountable obstacles on the way of the advancing [Ukrainian army] … to slow down the fair final of the war,” the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter. Rishi Sunak said if Russia was responsible for the destruction of the dam in Ukraine, it would be a “new low” for Moscow in the invasion. Speaking to reporters on board his official plane to Washington last night, the UK prime minister said: “If it is intentional it would represent the largest attack on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine since the start of the war.” The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said he had no independent information about the circumstances of the collapse but added: “One thing is clear: this is another devastating consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.” Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, and Janez Lenarčič, European commissioner for crisis management, issued a joint statement warning the attack could be a war crime. “It represents a new dimension of Russian atrocities and may constitute a violation of international law, notably international humanitarian law,” they said. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said at a televised town hall meeting: “By all accounts, this is aggression by the Russian side to stop the Ukrainian offensive, to defend its own country. This shows that this is a new dimension.” Local Russian authorities in the city of Nova Kakhovka initially denied anything had happened to the dam, then blamed the collapse on Ukrainian shelling. The Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed official from the Kherson emergency services as saying the dam had collapsed from structural weakness under water pressure. Zelenskiy called an emergency meeting of his national security council on Tuesday. “Russian terrorists,” Zelenskiy said on Twitter. “The destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant dam only confirms for the whole world that they must be expelled from every corner of Ukrainian land. “Not a single metre should be left to them, because they use every metre for terror. It’s only Ukraine’s victory that will return security. And this victory will come. The terrorists will not be able to stop Ukraine with water, missiles or anything else.” Prokudin posted a video to Telegram in which he said that as a result of the damage to the dam, “water will reach a critical level in five hours” and that evacuations had begun. Russia’s state-run news agency Tass cited emergency services saying 80 settlements could be affected. A Russian military blogger, Rybar, said 11 out of 28 spans in the dam were destroyed after explosions at 2am, though this could not immediately be verified. Another blogger said there were no reported missile attacks on the dam before the breach, while videos circulated on Russian channels were said to be of civilians evacuating. Vladimir Leontiev, the head of the Russian-occupied administration of Nova Kakhovka city, on the southern bank of the Dnipro, initially denied the dam had been blown up, according to the Ria Novosti news agency, but he was later reported to confirm there was “damage” and blamed it on shelling. Interfax quoted an unnamed representative from regional emergency services as saying the collapse was the result of a catastrophic structural failure. “The dam could not stand it: one support collapsed, and flooding began,” the representative said, adding that there were no attacks on the hydroelectric power station overnight. Last month, it was reported that water levels in the reservoir had reached a 30-year high as the Russian occupiers had kept relatively few sluice gates open, according to experts. David Helms, a former US air force and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meteorologist who has monitored the dam, said on Twitter: “The Russians allowed the reservoir to fill to record levels; if the dam failed ‘naturally’, it certainly failed due to six weeks of over-topping and stress on the structure.” The areas most under threat from flooding are the islands along the course of the Dnipro downstream of Nova Kakhovka and much of the Russian-held left bank in southern Kherson. Earlier modelling of such a disaster suggested Kherson city would not bear the brunt, but the harbour, the docklands and an island in the south of the city are likely to be inundated. It is unclear how many people could lose their homes. There could be two further serious side-effects: the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant upstream could lose access to water for cooling as the reservoir drains away, and the water supply to Crimea could also be severely affected. Four of the six reactors at the nuclear plant are completely shut down, and two are on “hot shutdown”, producing a small amount of energy for the plant itself and the neighbouring town. The International Atomic Energy Agency said in a tweet its experts at the plant were monitoring the situation. It said there was “no immediate nuclear safety risk at plant”. A Moscow-backed official in the Zaporizhzhia region was quoted by a Russian news agency as saying there was no “critical danger” to the plant yet. The dam, a Soviet power project, was completed in 1956 and was 30 metres high, holding back a vast reservoir of 18 cubic kilometres of water. It sits about 20 miles (32km) upstream from Ukrainian-held Kherson. Zelenskiy warned last November that Russia was plotting to blow up the two-mile structure and that doing so would cause “a large-scale disaster” affecting people living downstream."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jul/28/the-guardian-view-on-nuclear-warfare-dialogue-or-destruction","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T17:30:34Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on nuclear warfare: dialogue or destruction | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/28/the-guardian-view-on-nuclear-warfare-dialogue-or-destruction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/28/the-guardian-view-on-nuclear-warfare-dialogue-or-destruction","fields":{"bodyText":"When the most senior figure in Britain’s defence and security establishment warns of the increased risk of accidental nuclear war, the rest of us should pay attention. Even today, when security chiefs speak more often in public than they once did, they still ration their pronouncements. So when the UK’s national security adviser, Sir Stephen Lovegrove, speaks in Washington about a breakdown in communications with Russia and China causing an enhanced risk of “rapid escalation to strategic conflict”, as he did this week, those words should be taken very seriously indeed. The increased international danger is starkly obvious. Russia’s deliberate invasion of Ukraine, its use there of hypersonic Kinzhal weapons and its threats of further escalation involving its nuclear arsenal add up to the most destabilising repertoire of state-on-state aggression in modern Europe since 1945. In Asia, China’s increasingly bellicose postures over Taiwan and in the South China Sea, its intensive nuclear missile development programmes and its disdain towards arms control agreements raise the stakes much higher. Iran and North Korea, where Kim Jong-un appears to be preparing the country’s first nuclear test for five years, add further to the current volatility. Sir Stephen warned that what is happening is not a return to the nuclear tensions of the cold war. In those days, he argued, Nato and the Soviet Union by and large understood one another’s military doctrines of deterrence, containment and the avoidance of first nuclear weapon use. That is not the case today. Nuclear doctrine is opaque, and possibly different, in Moscow and Beijing, never mind in Pyongyang. The conditions for instability are therefore greater, either through deliberate acts or miscalculations. Although Sir Stephen did not say so, this environment could trigger a flawed and fateful western response, not just an act of aggression by one of the west’s adversaries. Western faith in dialogue with hostile rivals has been massively damaged by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A similar confrontation with China over Taiwan would shatter confidence still further. But Sir Stephen is right to say that all sides must continue to look for ways of conducting dialogue. Some foundations are better than none at all. For that reason alone, it is helpful that Joe Biden and Xi Jinping were holding their first conversation in many months on Thursday. The expected start of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference in New York next week is potentially another confidence-building development in a crucial area. In spite of all the obvious difficulties, arms control remains an indispensable means of tackling the current volatility. The key role in the west will continue to be played by the United States. But Britain is not currently doing its bit. Boris Johnson prefers to grandstand as a fancy dress war leader. Liz Truss is doing a Margaret Thatcher tribute act in the hope of becoming his successor. Rishi Sunak is afraid of saying anything for fear of the Tory right. This week, though, the Commons defence committee accused the government of being “arrogant and unwilling to learn the lessons” of its defence errors, including in Ukraine, while an Institute for Government report describes the Foreign Office as understaffed, with low morale and expertise on Russia continuing to be downgraded. Sir Stephen Lovegrove’s Washington speech may be a welcome piece of strategic thinking at the heart of government. But the people who most need to get his message are the British ministers for whom he works. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Here’s where we stand: The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has made a second visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine amid an escalation in the fighting around it. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA director general, was shown around the plant by Russian occupying forces and officials, telling reporters: “It is obvious that military activity is increasing in this whole region, so every possible measure and precautions should be taken so that the plant is not attacked. Russia has stopped informing the US about its nuclear activities, including missile test launches, after Moscow suspended its participation in the New Start arms control treaty last month, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said. The White House on Tuesday said the US had told Russia it would cease exchanging some data on its nuclear forces after Moscow’s refusal to do so. Russia began exercises with the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile system and several thousand of troops, its defence ministry said on Wednesday. Vladimir Putin has aimed to make the Yars missile system, which replaced the Topol system, part of Russia’s “invincible weapons” and the mainstay of the ground-based component of its nuclear arsenal. The German government has agreed to send an additional €12bn worth of military support to Ukraine. The Bundestag’s budget committee gave the green light on Wednesday for about €8bn to be spent directly on purchasing weapons and equipment for Ukraine. The other €4bn will go to the German military to replenish stocks. Spain will send six Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine after the Easter holiday, the Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles said on Wednesday. An explosion has been reported near a Russian military airbase in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014, according to footage shared on social media. The Russian-appointed head of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, posted to Telegram that “a UAV [drone] was shot down in the Simferopol region” and that there were “no casualties or damage”. Ukrainian forces have reportedly shelled the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city of Melitopol, south of the Zaporizhzhia region, and Russian media reported on Wednesday that as a result, the city’s power supply had been cut. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March last year, said on the Telegram messaging app that several explosions had gone off in the city. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s mercenary Wagner group, has said the battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut has “practically destroyed” the Ukrainian army but that his forces have also been “badly damaged”. Vladimir Putin has conceded that sanctions imposed on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine could bring about “negative” consequences for the country. Putin, in a televised meeting with the government, insisted Moscow was adapting to the penalties and that unemployment “remains at an all-time low”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Putin is an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything” over the last year of war. “He doesn’t have allies,” Zelenskiy said, adding that it was clear to him that even China was no longer willing to back Russia, despite Xi Jinping’s recent visit to Moscow. Zelenskiy also extended an invitation to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to visit Ukraine. “We are ready to see him here. I want to speak with him.” Zelenskiy said Ukraine needed 20 Patriot batteries to protect against Russian missiles, and even that may not be enough “as no country in the world was attacked with so many ballistic rockets”. He added that a European nation sent another air defence system to Ukraine, but it didn’t work and they “had to change it again and again”. He did not name the country. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has urged Russians not to adopt children who she said were “stolen” from her country during the war and deported to Russia. Vereshchuk, posting to Telegram, said orphans had been “stolen in Ukraine” and allegedly given up for adoption in Russia. Poland has urged the EU to limit the amount of Ukrainian grain entering the bloc’s market, its prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said, amid anger among farmers over the effect of imports on Polish grain prices. Ukraine’s sports ministry has condemned what it said was a partial change of position by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in international competitions as neutrals. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, described the IOC’s decision as “shameful”. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. We’ll be back tomorrow. Thank you for following. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has made a second visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine amid an escalation in the fighting around it. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA director general, was shown around the plant by Russian occupying forces and officials, telling reporters: It is obvious that military activity is increasing in this whole region, so every possible measure and precautions should be taken so that the plant is not attacked. “I think it’s no secret that there is a significant increase in the number of troops in the region, and there is open talk about offensive and counter offensives,” he added. The plant is on the south bank of the Dnieper river, which forms the frontline at a time when Russian forces have attempted to conduct a series of offensives and Ukraine is widely expected to launch a counter-offensive in the coming months. Grossi was accompanying three IAEA inspectors who will replace an outgoing monitoring team and are due to stay at the site for the next two months, the seventh team to take up the rotating role since the agency’s presence was accepted by Kyiv and Moscow. The director general is also in Zaporizhzhia to continue efforts to negotiate protections for the plant, which would require the agreement of Ukrainian and Russian forces not to fire in or out of the area. “There have been different concepts that we have been working on. Initially we were focusing on the possibility of the establishment of a well-determined zone around the plant. Now the concept is evolving and refocusing more on the protection itself and the things that should be avoided,” he said on Wednesday. “It is a work in progress.” Read the full story here: The German government has agreed to send an additional €12bn worth of military support to Ukraine, in a further shift away from its traditional pacifist stance. The Bundestag’s budget committee gave the green light today for about €8bn to be spent directly on purchasing weapons and equipment for Ukraine, approving a request by the German defence ministry and foreign office. The other €4bn will go to the German military to replenish stocks. About €12bn in total will be released related to the Ukraine conflict over the next decade or so. Since the start of the Russian invasion, the German government has made available more than €14.2bn in support for Ukraine, according to the foreign office. In a statement, three lawmakers representing the coalition government on the committee said: With the money, Ukraine can directly buy armaments with the support of the German government. The move represents a “very important step with which we make it clear that we are supporting Ukraine in the long term in its fight against Putin,” said Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius. The agreement will allow supplies including armoured vehicles, tanks, and ammunition to be delivered to Ukraine in the coming years, according to a statement from the minister. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has responded to remarks by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov who earlier today said Russia’s “hybrid war” against “hostile states” will continue “for a long time”. Peskov and Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, are both “wrong: the war can be ended diplomatically”, Podolyak posted to Twitter. He called on Russian forces to immediately withdraw from occupied parts of Ukraine, adding that “a reboot must happen in Moscow for that”. An explosion has been reported near a Russian military airbase in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014, according to footage shared on social media. The Russian-appointed head of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, posted to Telegram that “a UAV [drone] was shot down in the Simferopol region”. He added: It crashed in a field. There were no casualties or damage. It has not been possible to independently verify his claim. A letter from a Russian girl who drew anti-war pictures at school, addressed to her father who has reportedly fled house arrest after being sentenced to two years after being convicted of discrediting the armed force, has been made public. Alexei Moskalyov, a single parent from the town of Yefremov, 150 miles south of Moscow, was detained by police and placed under house arrest at the start of this month. His daughter Masha was moved to a state-run shelter. On Tuesday, a court spokesperson said Moskalyov had fled house arrest overnight and his whereabouts are currently not known. A human rights lawyer, Dmitry Zakhvatov, has since said Moskalyov had been in touch with him and sent him a copy of a letter that Masha had written him from the children’s home. The letter reads: Hi Dad, I really ask you not to get sick and not to worry. Everything is fine with me, I love you very much and know that you’re not guilty of anything. I am always on your side, and everything you do is right. It ends with “I love you” in English, and the words “you are a hero” inside a heart. The family said they had faced pressure from police since last April when Masha, a sixth-grader, refused to participate in a patriotic class at her school and made several drawings showing rockets being fired at a family standing under a Ukrainian flag and another that said “Glory to Ukraine!” School officials at the time summoned the police, who questioned the girl and threatened her father. He was eventually charged with discrediting the armed forces for his social media posts in which he called the Russian regime “terrorists” and described the Russian army as “rapists”. The high-profile case was criticised by Russian human rights groups and led to an online campaign to reunite father and daughter. Russian authorities have put a member of the feminist punk group Pussy Riot on a wanted list for criminal suspects, according to an interior ministry database. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova is on Russia’s federal wanted list, Russian news outlet Mediazona has reported. The entry said Tolokonnikova faces criminal charges, but it did not specify what the charges are. Tolokonnikova left Russia and reportedly lives in the US. She was designated a “foreign agent” by the Russian government in 2021. My colleague Zoe Williams interviewed Tolokonnikova in March last year. Vladimir Putin has conceded that sanctions imposed on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine could bring about “negative” consequences for the country, but insisted Moscow was adapting to the penalties. Putin, in a televised meeting with the government, said: The sanctions imposed against the Russian economy in the medium term could really have a negative impact. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry, has shared the clip: During the meeting, Putin said unemployment in Russia “remains at an all-time low” and that inflation is expected to “drop below 4%” by the end of March after soaring in spring last year. However the “return to a growth trajectory should not make us feel relaxed”, he said. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Tthe UN’s nuclear agency chief, Rafael Grossi, has said the situation is not improving at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant after visiting Zaporizhzhia in an occupied region of Ukraine. While on the Russian-held territory, Grossi told Russian news agencies including Tass that “Obviously, the situation is not improving, on the contrary, hostilities around this territory are intensifying. All possible measures must be taken to protect the station from any attack.” Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s mercenary Wagner group, has said the battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut has “practically destroyed” the Ukrainian army but that his forces have also been “badly damaged”. Russia has stopped informing the US about its nuclear activities, including missile test launches, after Moscow suspended its participation in the New Start arms control treaty last month, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said. The White House on Tuesday said the US had told Russia it would cease exchanging some data on its nuclear forces after Moscow’s refusal to do so. Russia began exercises with the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile system and several thousand of troops, its defence ministry said on Wednesday. Vladimir Putin has aimed to make the Yars missile system, which replaced the Topol system, part of Russia’s “invincible weapons” and the mainstay of the ground-based component of its nuclear arsenal. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Russian president Vladimir Putin is an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything” over the last year of war. “He doesn’t have allies,” Zelenskiy said, adding that it was clear to him that even China was no longer willing to back Russia, despite Xi Jinping’s recent visit to Moscow. Zelenskiy suggested that Putin’s announcement shortly after Xi’s visit that he would move tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, closer to Nato territory, was meant to deflect from the fact that the Chinese leader’s visit did not go well. Putin said the move was a counter to Britain’s decision to provide more depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine. Belarus has pinned the move as being a response to Nato aggression on its borders. Zelenskiy extended an invitation to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to visit Ukraine. “We are ready to see him here. I want to speak with him. I had contact with him before full-scale war. But during all this year, more than one year, I didn’t have,” he said. The Chinese leader invited Vladimir Putin to visit Beijing this year during a meeting in Moscow earlier this month. Zelenskiy said Ukraine needed 20 Patriot batteries to protect against Russian missiles, and even that may not be enough “as no country in the world was attacked with so many ballistic rockets”. He added that a European nation sent another air defence system to Ukraine, but it didn’t work and they “had to change it again and again”. He did not name the country. Ukrainian forces have reportedly shelled the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city of Melitopol, south of the Zaporizhzhia region, and Russian media reported on Wednesday that as a result, the city’s power supply had been cut. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March last year, said on the Telegram messaging app that several explosions had gone off in the city. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has urged Russians not to adopt children who she said were “stolen” from her country during the war and deported to Russia. Vereshchuk, posting to Telegram, said orphans had been “stolen in Ukraine” and allegedly given up for adoption in Russia. Spain will send six Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine after the Easter holiday, the Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles said. Spain will repair another four tanks that will be sent “in the near future”, she added. Russia’s cyberwar on Ukraine largely failed and Moscow is increasingly targeting Kyiv’s European allies, according to US and French analysts. French defence firm Thales said in a report on Wednesday that Russia was hitting Poland, the Nordic and Baltic countries with an arsenal of cyber weapons aiming to sow divisions and promote anti-war messages. Sweden’s foreign ministry on Wednesday summoned Russia’s Stockholm ambassador to complain about a statement on the Russian embassy’s website that said joining Nato made the Nordic nation a “legitimate target”. Poland has urged the EU to limit the amount of Ukrainian grain entering the bloc’s market, its prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said, amid anger among farmers over the effect of imports on Polish grain prices. Ukraine’s sports ministry has condemned what it said was a partial change of position by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in international competitions as neutrals. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, described the IOC’s decision as “shameful”. Good afternoon from London, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest news from the Russia-Ukraine war. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. Poland has urged the EU to limit the amount of Ukrainian grain entering the bloc’s market, its prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said, amid anger among farmers over the effect of imports on Polish grain prices. Morawiecki said he had agreed with the leaders of several countries bordering Ukraine to write to the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, to demand action. Morawiecki, at a news conference, said: We demand the use of all regulatory instruments - quotas, tariffs, which will limit or block the import of Ukrainian grain into Poland. Ukraine, one of the world’s largest grain exporters, has been forced to find alternative shipping routes through Poland and Romania, after its Black Sea ports were blocked following Russia’s invasion. But logistical bottlenecks have meant large quantities of Ukrainian grains, which are cheaper than those produced in the EU, have ended up in central Europen countries, Reuters reports. The influx of Ukrainian grain has damaged prices and sales of local farmers, and caused a major headache for Poland’s ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party in an election year. Here are some images we have received from the news wires of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi visiting Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been held by Russian forces for more than a year. Ukraine’s sports ministry condemned on Wednesday what it said was a partial change of position by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in international competitions as neutrals. “The ministry of youth and sports of Ukraine condemns the partial change of the position of the International Olympic Committee regarding the non-admission of Russian and Belarusian athletes,” Reuters reports the Ukrainian ministry said in a statement. “We have consistently advocated and will continue to insist that under the conditions of the unprecedented unprovoked military aggression of the Russian Federation with the support of the republic of Belarus against Ukraine, which contradicts the principles of the Olympic charter, representatives of aggressor states should not be present at international sports arenas.” Reuters is carrying a quick snap that the Danish energy agency says that the object found near the Nord Stream 2 pipeline does not pose a safety risk, and is an empty maritime smoke buoy, which is used for visual marking. Rafael Grossi, the UN’s nuclear agency chief, has told the media in Russia that the situation is not improving at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant after visiting Zaporizhzhia in an occupied region of Ukraine. While on the Russian-held territory, Grossi told Russian news agencies including Tass that “Obviously, the situation is not improving, on the contrary, hostilities around this territory are intensifying. All possible measures must be taken to protect the station from any attack.” Tass reports that he was shown “objects damaged as a result of shelling by the armed forces of Ukraine”. Russian forces have occupied the plant since March 2022, forcing Ukrainian staff to continue working while under occupation. Russia has claimed that Ukraine has shelled both the station and the nearby residential area of Enerhodar. Ukraine has claimed that shelling has been by Russian forces. Grossi previously visited the site in September 2022. Spain will send six Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine after the Easter holiday, Reuters is reporting the Spanish defence minister, Margarita Robles, as saying. The German-made battle tanks have not been used since the 1990s, Robles told lawmakers, adding that Spain had repaired them and would test their combat readiness before shipping them to support Ukraine’s efforts to fend off Russia’s invasion. Spain will repair another four tanks that will be sent “in the near future”, she added. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s mercenary Wagner group, has said the battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut has “practically destroyed” the Ukrainian army but that his forces have also been “badly damaged”. In an audio message, Prigozhin said: The battle for Bakhmut today has already practically destroyed the Ukrainian army and, unfortunately, it has also badly damaged the Wagner private military company. Asked about Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s promise to defend Bakhmut to the end, CNN reported Prigozhin as saying his forces would win in “the greatest turn in this war and in all modern history”. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has condemned the International Olympic Committee’s recommendation that Russian and Belarusian athletes compete as neutrals, describing the decision as “shameful”. Speaking at a news conference, Morawiecki said Poland would build “a coalition of states to together demand that the IOC withdraw this bad and wrong decision”. Russia has stopped informing the US about its nuclear activities, including missile test launches, after Moscow suspended its participation in the New Start arms control treaty last month, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said. Ryabkov, in remarks carried by Interfax news agency, said: There will be no notifications at all. All notifications, all kinds of notifications, all activities under the treaty will be suspended and will not be conducted regardless of what position the US may take. The 2010 New Start treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms treaty between the US and Russia, limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads each side can deploy. The US and Russia hold nearly 90% of the world’s nuclear warheads between them. Vladimir Putin announced last month that Russia was suspending participation in the treaty, accusing Washington of trying to inflict a “strategic defeat” on Russia in Ukraine. Ryabkov’s remarks reflect a change of course, after the Russian foreign ministry initially said it would continue notifying the US about planned test launches of its ballistic missiles. The White House on Tuesday said the US had told Russia it would cease exchanging some data on its nuclear forces after Moscow’s refusal to do so. A spokesperson for the US national security council said yesterday: Under international law, the United States has the right to respond to Russia’s breaches of the New Start treaty by taking proportionate and reversible countermeasures in order to induce Russia to return to compliance with its obligations. It comes as Russia conducted drills of its strategic missile forces today, deploying mobile launchers in Siberia in a show of the country’s nuclear capability. A Siberian journalist whose news website published content that was critical of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has gone on trial charged with discrediting Moscow’s armed forces, according to a report. Mikhail Afanasyev, one of the best-known journalists in Siberia and chief editor of Novy Fokus in the Russian region of Khakassia, was arrested by security forces in April 2022. His arrest came after the website’s reporting on 11 riot police officers who allegedly refused deployment to Ukraine. He was accused of disseminating “deliberately false information” about the Russian armed forces, an offence that carries a maximum jail sentence of 10 years under a law passed last year. My colleague Andrew Roth reported on Afanasyev’s arrest last April: Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has urged Russians not to adopt children who she said were “stolen” from her country during the war and deported to Russia. Vereshchuk, posting to Telegram, said orphans had been “stolen in Ukraine” and allegedly given up for adoption in Russia. She said: I strongly recommend that Russian citizens do not adopt Ukrainian orphans who were illegally taken out of the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. Nearly 20,000 Ukrainian children are currently considered illegally deported to Russia or Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, according to Ukraine’s ministry of integration of occupied territories. Russia says it has been evacuating people voluntarily from Ukraine, and claims it has brought thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia to protect orphans and children abandoned in the conflict zone. Russia’s defence ministry said in mid-August that 3.5m people had been brought to Russia by then, including more than half a million children. According to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office, 464 children have died so far since the war began in February last year. Police have estimated that 356 are still missing. Writing on her Telegram account today, Vereshchuk added: Once again I remind all Russian so-called ‘adoptive parents’ and ‘guardians’: sooner or later you will have to answer. The international criminal court (ICC) in the Hague issued an arrest warrant earlier this month against President Vladimir Putin and his commissioner for children’s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, accusing them of the war crime of illegally deporting Ukrainian children. More than 220,000 Russian personnel have been killed or injured since its troops invaded Ukraine more than a year ago, Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said, citing the latest US assessment. From Sky News’ Deborah Haynes: Russia’s “confrontation with hostile states” is “going to last for a long time”, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said. My colleague Pjotr Sauer reports: Here’s more from that Associated Press interview with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, where the Ukrainian president extended an invitation to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to visit his country. Zelenskiy, who has not spoken to Xi since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year, said: We are ready to see him here. I want to speak with him. I had contact with him before full-scale war. But during all this year, more than one year, I didn’t have. The Chinese leader invited Vladimir Putin to visit Beijing this year during a meeting in Moscow earlier this month. Asked if Xi would accept Zelenskiy’s invitation, or whether one had been officially extended, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters she had no information to give. She added that Beijing maintains “communication with all parties concerned, including Ukraine”. In response to Zelenskiy’s interview, the Kremlin said it was not up to Moscow to advise the Chinese leader on whether he should visit Ukraine or not. Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, has arrived the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southeastern Ukraine, a spokesperson for the International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed. The IAEA chief is visiting Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since near the beginning of the invasion, to review the situation there, the spokesperson said. They said: At the plant now. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong here taking over the live blog from Martin Belam. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Russian president Vladimir Putin is an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything” over the last year of war. “He doesn’t have allies,” Zelenskiy said, adding that it was clear to him that even China was no longer willing to back Russia, despite Xi Jinping’s recent visit to Moscow.

Ukrainian forces have reportedly shelled the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city of Melitopol, south of the Zaporizhzhia region, and Russian media reported on Wednesday that as a result, the city’s power supply had been cut. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March last year, said on the Telegram messaging app that several explosions had gone off in the city. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that on 28 March five residents of Donetsk – three in Bakhmut and two in Chasiv Yar – were injured. The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, is due to visit the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine on Wednesday, with Russian media outlets reporting he has arrived. He has described the situation there as very dangerous. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation, has restated that Russia intends to achieve all the aims of what it terms its “special military operation”, despite, he said, “the steadily increasing military assistance to Ukraine from the US and other western states.” Russia’s cyberwar on Ukraine largely failed and Moscow is increasingly targeting Kyiv’s European allies, according to US and French analysts. French defence firm Thales said in a report on Wednesday that Russia was hitting Poland, the Nordic and Baltic countries with an arsenal of cyber weapons aiming to sow divisions and promote anti-war messages. Global commodities trader Cargill has told Russia’s agriculture ministry that it will stop exporting Russian grain from the start of the next exporting season, which begins on 1 July, the ministry said on Wednesday. Sweden’s foreign ministry on Wednesday summoned Russia’s Stockholm ambassador to complain about a statement on the Russian embassy’s website that said joining Nato made the Nordic nation a “legitimate target”. Sweden’s admission to Nato faces challenges as Hungary has grievances about criticism it has received from the Nordic state, and bridging this gap will require significant efforts on both sides, the Hungarian government’s spokesperson tweeted on Wednesday. After months of foot-dragging Hungary’s parliament approved a bill on Monday to allow Finland to join Nato but the Swedish bill is still stranded in parliament. Hungary’s foreign minister held telephone talks with the Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, about gas and oil shipments as well as nuclear cooperation, the Hungarian minister said late on Tuesday. In a statement, Péter Szijjártó said Novak had reassured him that despite international sanctions, the Russian party would be able to do maintenance work on the Turkstream pipeline. Russia’s state-owned news agency RIA has reported that the UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi has now arrived at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since very near the beginning of the invasion. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, is reporting that there are power outages in some areas of Kyiv and also Odesa which have been caused by weather conditions, rather than enemy action. It writes: In Kyiv and the region, due to worsening weather conditions, emergency shutdowns of lights were used. Most of them are at the Vyshhorod, Kyiv-Sviatoshyn, and Vasylkiv power stations, DTEK reported. There are also stabilizing power outages in some areas of the capital and the region. In Odesa, seven settlements remain without power due to bad weather. Russia’s embassy in the US has issued a punchy statement overnight in response to what it says are “statements of a number of US administration officials on support for the creation of a special tribunal against Russia”. It writes on its official Telegram channel: Such comments are an outright profanity that has nothing to do with justice. The US continues to demonstrate a complete disregard for the norms of international law in favour of its own geopolitical interests. The outrageous and unfounded accusations of alleged aggression, crimes against humanity and other violations are nothing more than an element of the Russophobic campaign organised by Washington as part of the hybrid war unleashed against us. The US hypocritically and cynically refrains from assessing the criminal acts of the nazis who have settled in Kyiv and have been terrorising civilians for many years. Washington is silent about its own role in the incitement of the Ukrainian conflict. It continues to support [the] Zelenskiy regime through the endless supply of lethal weapons, as a result of which the civilian population continues to die, including children, and kindergartens, schools and hospitals are destroyed. How may Washington speculate on “responsibility for aggression”, when the international community has not yet recovered from the catastrophic consequences of American adventurist interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan, bombing of Yugoslavia and the atrocities in Vietnam? Sweden’s foreign ministry on Wednesday summoned Russia’s Stockholm ambassador to complain about a statement on the Russian embassy’s website that said joining Nato made the Nordic nation a “legitimate target”, Reuters reports, citing news agency TT. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation, has restated that Russia intends to achieve all the aims of what it terms its “special military operation”. State-owned news agency Tass quotes him saying: Despite the steadily increasing military assistance to Ukraine from the US and other western states, all the declared goals of the special military operation will certainly be achieved. We will achieve the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine, ensure the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation and the security of our population. Late last year the Russian Federation claimed to annex four regions of Ukraine after organising widely derided “referendums” in the regions which they partially occupied. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, in a move not widely recognised by the international community. An IAEA spokesperson has confirmed that UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi was on his way to the plant. He said Grossi was in the Zaporizhzhia region, but declined to say where. According to Reuters, he shared a photograph of Grossi standing in body armour by an armoured UN car on the side of a road. Sweden’s admission to Nato faces challenges as Hungary has grievances about criticism it has received from the Nordic state, and bridging this gap will require significant efforts on both sides, the Hungarian government’s spokesperson tweeted on Wednesday, Reuters reports. After months of foot-dragging Hungary’s parliament approved a bill on Monday to allow Finland to join Nato but the Swedish bill is still stranded in parliament. More from that Associated Press interview with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, where Ukraine’s president was unstinting in his criticism of his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Zelenskiy said Putin was an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything” over the last year of war. “He doesn’t have allies,” Zelenskiy said, adding that it was clear to him that even China was no longer willing to back Russia. President Xi Jinping has recently attended a state visit in Moscow, and extended an invitation to Putin to visit Beijing. Zelenskiy suggested that Putin’s announcement shortly after Xi’s visit that he would move tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, closer to Nato territory, was meant to deflect from the fact that the Chinese leader’s visit did not go well. Putin said the move was a counter to Britain’s decision to provide more depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine. Belarus has pinned the move as being a response to Nato aggression on its borders. Despite Putin’s nuclear provocations, and some of the harsh rhetoric that has come from his allies such as Dmitry Medvedev, Zelenskiy told AP he does not believe the Russian leader is prepared to use the bomb. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, offers this news round-up of the latest developments on its official Telegram channel: In the morning, a series of explosions rang out in the temporarily occupied Melitopol in Zaporizhzhia. The lights went out in some areas of the city and settlements. During the day, the Russian army launched 34 airstrikes and artillery strikes on the de-occupied part of Kherson region, three on Kherson. It struck houses, a hospital and a post office. One person is injured. At night, the Ukrainian military destroyed a Russian Su-24M bomber in the direction of Bakhmut, the air force reported. The claims have not been independently verified. Journalists from Associated Press accompanied Volodymyr Zelenskiy on part of his trip this week around frontline regions of Ukraine, and to the border region of Sumy. During that time, Ukraine’s president reiterated requests for more modern weaponry, and also said some elements that had been supplied by the west had not worked. “We have great decisions about Patriots, but we don’t have them for real,” he said, referring to the US-made air defence system that has been promised. Zelenskiy said Ukraine needed 20 Patriot batteries to protect against Russian missiles, and even that may not be enough “as no country in the world was attacked with so many ballistic rockets”. Zelenskiy added that a European nation sent another air defence system to Ukraine, but it didn’t work and they “had to change it again and again”. He did not name the country. Zelenskiy also reiterated his longstanding request for fighter jets, saying: “We still don’t have anything when it comes to modern warplanes.” Poland and Slovakia have decided to give Soviet-era fighter jets to Ukraine, but no western country so far has agreed to provide modern warplanes, through concerns that it might escalate the conflict and provide Ukraine with strike capabilities deep into Russian territory, and that the length of time that it would take to train pilots and provision ground crews makes the delivery in the short-term impractical. Global commodities trader Cargill has told Russia’s agriculture ministry that it will stop exporting Russian grain from the start of the next exporting season, which begins on 1 July, the ministry said on Wednesday. “The cessation of its export activities on the Russian market will not affect the volume of domestic grain shipments abroad. The company’s grain export assets will continue to operate regardless of who manages them,” the agriculture ministry said in a comment to Reuters. A spokesperson for Cargill’s Russian unit declined to comment to the news agency. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that on 28 March five residents of Donetsk – three in Bakhmut and two in Chasiv Yar – were injured due to the war. Hungary’s foreign minister held telephone talks with the Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, about gas and oil shipments as well as nuclear cooperation, the Hungarian minister said late on Tuesday. In a statement, Péter Szijjártó said Novak had reassured him that despite international sanctions, the Russian party would be able to do maintenance work on the Turkstream pipeline. “Thus Hungary’s gas supply will continue without any disruptions,” the statement added. That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan. My colleague Martin Belam will take you through the rest of the day’s news. Russia’s cyberwar on Ukraine largely failed and Moscow is increasingly targeting Kyiv’s European allies, according to US and French analysts. French defence firm Thales said in a report on Wednesday that Russia was hitting Poland, the Nordic and Baltic countries with an arsenal of cyber weapons aiming to sow divisions and promote anti-war messages. Microsoft said in a threat assessment earlier this month that Russian actors had launched attacks in at least 17 European countries in the first six weeks of this year. Thales and Microsoft said Russia’s invasion was accompanied by widespread cyberattacks in Ukraine, but they were repelled. Both firms said Russia shifted focus to other European countries late last year. “In the third quarter of 2022, Europe was dragged into a high-intensity hybrid cyberwar at a turning point in the conflict,” said Pierre-Yves Jolivet, Thales vice president for cyber solutions. Jolivet said countries outside Ukraine were suffering a “massive wave” of DDoS attacks, when a server is flooded with requests that crash the network. These attacks were increasingly carried out by “hacktivist” groups aligned with the Kremlin rather than official groups, and they aimed to sow chaos rather than destroy infrastructure, Thales said. Poland, Latvia and Sweden were among the most affected countries, the Thales report said. Microsoft said in its assessment that attacks this year in Europe were largely aimed at government entities for espionage purposes. Ukrainian forces have reportedly shelled the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city of Melitopol, south of the Zaporizhzhia region, and Russian media reported on Wednesday that as a result, the city’s power supply had been cut. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March last year, said on the Telegram messaging app that several explosions had gone off in the city. Russia’s state TASS news agency, citing Moscow-installed officials in the area, said Ukrainian shelling had damaged the city’s power supply system and knocked out electricity in the city and some nearby villages. TASS also reported that a locomotive depot was destroyed but according to initial information, there were no casualties. The Guardian has not verified these reports independently. The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, is visiting the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine today. He has described the situation there as very dangerous. He said in an interview with Reuters that his work on forging an agreement to protect Europe’s largest nuclear power station was still alive. Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the site. The nuclear facility has lost its external power supply six times since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago, forcing emergency diesel generators to kick in to cool its reactors. Grossi, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the water level in a nearby reservoir controlled by Russian forces was another potential danger. Water supplied by the reservoir is used to cool the reactors. He told Reuters yesterday: If the reservoir level goes down beyond a certain level, then you don’t have water to cool down the reactors, and we have seen especially in January that the levels of the water were going down significantly. They recovered somehow in the past few weeks. He added that there had been increasing military activity in the region without giving details. Grossi said his attempt to broker a deal to protect the plant was still alive, and that he was adjusting the proposals to seek a breakthrough. Russia began exercises with the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile system and several thousand of troops, its defence ministry said on Wednesday, in what is likely to be seen as another attempt by Moscow to show off its nuclear strength, Reuters reports. President Vladimir Putin has aimed to make the Yars missile system, which replaced the Topol system, part of Russia’s “invincible weapons” and the mainstay of the ground-based component of its nuclear arsenal. “In total, more than 3,000 military personnel and about 300 pieces of equipment are involved in the exercises,” the defence ministry said in a statement on Telegram. The drills involve the Strategic Missile Forces comprehensive control checking of the Omsk missile formation together with a command and staff exercise with the Novosibirsk missile formation equipped with the Yars systems. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said in an interview that he he worries the war could be affected by shifting political forces in Washington. In an interview with AP, published a short while ago, Zelenskiy said: “The United States really understands that if they stop helping us, we will not win”. Following its long interview with Ukraine’s leader, AP reports: Zelenskiy is well aware that his country’s success has been in great part due to waves of international military support, particularly from the United States and western Europe. But some in the United States – including Republican Donald Trump, the former American president and current 2024 candidate – have questioned whether Washington should continue to supply Ukraine with billions of dollars in military aid. Trump’s likely Republican rival, the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, also suggested that defending Ukraine in a ‘territorial dispute’ with Russia was not a significant US national security priority. He later walked that statement back after facing criticism from other corners of the GOP. Zelenskiy didn’t mention the names of Trump or any other Republican politicians – figures he might have to deal with if they prevailed in 2024 elections. Welcome back to our continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan bringing you the latest. Our top story this morning: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, says that he he worries the war could be impacted by shifting political forces in Washington. In an interview with AP, published a short while ago, Zelenskiy said: “The United States really understands that if they stop helping us, we will not win”. And Russia began exercises with the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile system and several thousand troops, its defence ministry said on Wednesday, in what is likely to be seen as another attempt by Moscow to show off its nuclear strength. We’ll have more on these stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments. The United States has not seen any indications that Vladimir Putin is getting closer to using tactical nuclear weapons in his war on Ukraine, after the Russian leader said he was moving such weapons into Belarus. Belarus confirmed it would host Russian tactical nuclear weapons, saying the decision was a response to years of western pressure. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said Belarus would face further EU sanctions. Russia said it shot down a US-supplied GLSDB guided smart bomb fired by Ukrainian forces, the first time Moscow has claimed to have intercepted one of the weapons that could double Ukraine’s battlefield firing range. Ukraine’s frontline city of Avdiivka “is being wiped off the face of the Earth” amid intensifying Russian shelling, according to its top local official. Russian forces have been making recent gradual gains on the flanks of Avdiivka, and the Ukrainian military said last week that the city could become a “second Bakhmut”. Russia’s 10th tank regiment has borne the brunt of the assault of Avdiivka and has likely lost a “large portion of its tanks” while attempting to surround the town from the south, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. Ukraine is aiming to exhaust and inflict heavy losses on Russian forces trying to capture the small eastern city of Bakhmut, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces has said. In a video showing him addressing soldiers in what appeared to be a large industrial warehouse, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was continuing to focus on the Bakhmut area after months of battle. Germany’s much-awaited shipment of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks has arrived in Ukraine, the German defence ministry has confirmed. Berlin first promised 14 but increased that to 18 as part of a deal under which several EU states would contribute to a shipment of two Leopard 2 battalions and 31 American-made M1A2 Abrams tanks from the US. The first British Challenger 2 main battle tanks have also arrived in Ukraine and will soon begin combat missions, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said. The UK said in January it would send 14 of the tanks to Ukraine. Reznikov wrote on Twitter that the tanks had “recently arrived in our country” and posted a video that showed him sitting in one of a long line of tanks in an open field, all of them flying Ukraine’s yellow and blue flag. The US supports the creation of a special tribunal to prosecute the crime of aggression against Ukraine, officials have said. The US ambassador-at-large for global criminal justice, Beth Van Schaak said the court might also be located elsewhere in Europe, at least at first, in order “to reinforce Ukraine’s desired European orientation”. A Russian man who was investigated by police after his 12-year-old daughter drew a picture depicting Russian bombing a family in Ukraine has been sentenced to two years in a penal colony, according to a rights group. Alexei Moskalyov has been separated from his daughter Maria since he was placed under house arrest, and she was taken into a state-run shelter last month. Court officials said on Tuesday that the 54-year-old had fled house arrest and his whereabouts were unknown. The International Olympic Committee has recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in international sporting events under a neutral flag. A decision regarding next year’s Olympics in Paris and the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics in 2026 would be taken “at the appropriate time”, it said. Germany’s interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said the committee’s decision was “a slap in the face for all Ukrainian athletes”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/14/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-445-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-14T01:04:46Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 445 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/14/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-445-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/14/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-445-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has landed in Berlin, according to a post on the Ukrainian president’s Twitter feed, as he seeks to shore up support from key allies. “Already in Berlin,” Zelenskiy tweeted shortly after midnight on Sunday, arriving from Italy where he met with Italian officials and Pope Francis. The German government has announced a further €2.7bn of military aid to Ukraine, its biggest such package since the Russian invasion. Russian missiles struck the home town of Ukraine’s Eurovision entry during the song contest. Ternopil, the university home town of electronic music duo Tvorchi, was among the places targeted, according to Dame Melinda Simmons, the British ambassador to Ukraine. Local authorities said the strike had hit warehouses owned by commercial enterprises and a religious organisation, injuring two people. The Russian news outlet Kommersant reported that two Russian fighter jets and two military helicopters had been shot down on Saturday close to the Ukrainian border. Kommersant said on its website that the Su-34 fighter-bomber, Su-35 fighter and two Mi-8 helicopters had made up a raiding party, and had been “shot down almost simultaneously” in an ambush in the Bryansk region, adjoining north-east Ukraine. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will push other global leaders to pledge more support for Ukraine when he attends international summits next week, according to his office. Sunak will travel to Iceland on Tuesday to meet other European leaders attending a Council of Europe summit. South Africa’s presidential security adviser said the country was “actively non-aligned” in Russia’s war against Ukraine, after US allegations it had supplied weapons to Moscow led to a diplomatic crisis. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had spoken to the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and urged him to help implement Kyiv’s peace plan to end the war. Ukrainian forces have regained at least a kilometre of territory in Bakhmut amid a Russian withdrawal that reflects Moscow’s “severe shortage of credible combat units”, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in an intelligence briefing. It said elements of a Russian brigade withdrew “in bad order” from their positions on the southern flank of the eastern Ukrainian city, the scene of the war’s longest battle. Japan has expressed concern about Russian and Chinese military cooperation in Asia and believes the two countries are strengthening their joint exercises. Foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said the security situation in Europe and the Indo-Pacific region was indivisible since the war in Ukraine started and that Russia’s invasion had “shaken the very foundation of the international order”. Russian attacks injured three people in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, the city’s mayor said. The strikes occurred early on Saturday, Oleksandr Sienkevych said on his Telegram channel. Russian forces targeted a factory, also damaging nearby residential buildings, causing fires in three apartments and damaging an educational institution, he said. A 15-year-old girl was among two people killed while 10 more were injured in a Russian shelling attack, Ukraine’s defence ministry said. The eastern city of Kostyantynivka was targeted by Smerch rocket launchers. Russian-installed officials in Luhansk have said missiles fired by Ukrainian forces injured six children and a Russian parliamentarian and damaged two disused factories in the eastern Ukrainian region’s main city, about 100km (60 miles) behind the frontlines. An unidentified object that entered Polish airspace from the direction of Belarus was probably an observation balloon, Poland’s defence ministry said on Saturday. A spokesperson for Poland’s territorial defence force said a search for the object was under way. Police in the Russian city of St Petersburg have created an anti-drone unit after a suspected attack on the Kremlin last week. The unit was launched on Tuesday during the annual second world war Victory Day celebrations on St Petersburg’s Palace Square, the city’s interior ministry said. The UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, plans to present an agreement with Russia and Ukraine on protecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the UN security council this month, indicating a deal is close, four diplomats have said. Grossi has been trying for months to secure an agreement to reduce the risk of a catastrophic accident from shelling at the Russian-occupied nuclear power station, Europe’s biggest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/nov/20/jason-david-frank-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-star-dies","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-20T20:27:29Z","webTitle":"Jason David Frank, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers star, dies at 49","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/20/jason-david-frank-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-star-dies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/20/jason-david-frank-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-star-dies","fields":{"bodyText":"The actor and mixed martial artist Jason David Frank, who starred on the television series Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, has died, his representatives confirmed to the entertain news outlet Geek Ireland. He was 49 years old. Frank attained fame in the early 1990s as the green power ranger, Tommy Oliver, who then becomes the white power ranger on a children’s television show about superheroes who are particularly skilled in martial arts. The show generated spin-off movies, action figures and other toys. A cause of death was not immediately released, though multiple reports indicated Frank died by suicide. Word of Frank’s death prompted Mighty Morphin Power Rangers fans to flood social media with tributes. Walter Emanuel Jones, the actor who played the original black power ranger, wrote on Instagram that he was sad to have lost a member of his “special family”. “Can’t believe it,” Jones’s post added. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was about five teenagers deputized to save Earth from evil – it debuted on Fox in 1993 before becoming a pop-culture phenomenon. Early in the first season, Frank’s character was initially a villain, brainwashed by the evil antagonist Rita Repulsa. But soon after, he was inducted in the group of heroes and became one of the most popular characters on the show and its related titles. A practitioner of martial arts, Frank fought in several mixed martial arts bouts in 2009 and 2010. TMZ first reported Frank’s death and said his second wife, Tammie Frank, filed for divorce from him in August. Frank is survived by four children – one from his marriage with Tammie Frank and three from his first marriage to Shawna Frank.

From contraception to HPV vaccines to the politics of pain relief in childbirth, much of what many of us “know” comes from old wives’ tales, fleeting appointments with GPs or advice from tipsy aunts. For every enlightened pal who lets you know some side-effects your doctor didn’t mention, there is an equally ill-informed Twitter account broadcasting that the morning-after pill leaves you infertile or the pill increases the chances of your child having ADHD. With such sophistry and illusion around the facts, there’s ample space for terrible “wellness” advice, such as blaming cramps on Mercury being in retrograde or Gwyneth Paltrow selling jade eggs to insert into your vagina to “balance hormones”. Snake oil and other potentially harmful alternative treatments can get more traction when the side-effects of progesterone are ill-researched, black women are four times more likely to die during childbirth than their white counterparts and waiting lists for Mirena coils are, as this programme tells us, up to a year long. I remember sitting in the same room as another young mother, each doing our postpartum health centre visits, and hearing the copper coil and the Mirena coil explained to her as exactly the same. As a long-term Mirena coil user, who at one point had periods so agonising my vision would blur, I wanted to scream to her: “One will probably make your periods lighter or disappear and the other will likely make them heavier and more painful!” There are reasons to go with a copper coil, but there are significant differences that are outlined in detail by one of the nurses interviewed by Davina McCall in this documentary. Unlike her, I kept this information to myself and said nothing to the stranger. Now, years later, I can’t help but imagine how justifiably angry she would feel watching Davina McCall’s Pill Revolution. It’s a one-off documentary looking at the current state of contraception in the UK. McCall had a terrible time on the pill herself as a teenager, and having seen one daughter go through something similar while her other daughter was absolutely fine, she investigates just what choices are available to us, why the information about them is so unreliable and why accessing the best options for our physical and mental health is a minefield. McCall talks to medical experts, politicians, researchers and regular people about the consequences of contraception. Even though many of them give hugely helpful information, and McCall goes so far as to be filmed having her own Mirena coil replaced on camera – talking us through the experience including the brief moments of discomfort – there are still glaring holes in the research that she cannot compensate for. McCall’s doctor explains that there is only limited research on the side-effects for some contraceptives – from weight gain to loss of libido to volatile mood swings – as they are regarded as acceptable consequences for women to endure for birth control. The documentary features some heartbreaking testimony from those who started the pill only to be overcome by depression, leaving their relationships and careers in disarray. Others who couldn’t bear it any longer resorted to unreliable fertility tracking apps, which led to unwanted pregnancies. In the middle of a mental health crisis, it’s shocking to hear how little we know about the ramifications of these medications on depression and anxiety when these people can testify to these drugs causing a seismic shift in their mental state. Unlike in Europe, the doctor explains that women in the UK have to work the system if they want to be prescribed anything other than the cheapest contraception (the combined pill microgynon) and to get an alternative, such as a coil, an implant or simply a different pill. While NHS doctors can prescribe the Mirena coil as a treatment for painful periods, they tell McCall that they can’t do it simply because a patient wants effective contraception. These hard-to-swallow truths are ones that Pill Revolution tries to present in as palatable a way as possible. McCall is as charming and smiley as ever, at one point donning a sparkly red gown to create a camp, miniature gameshow within the programme. There are “true or false” rounds about popular contraception myths and a spinning roulette wheel where literal guinea pigs get to “win” the many possible symptoms from taking the pill. But McCall also demonstrates her skill as an interviewer capable of shifting into a more serious mode. When she meets Maria Caulfield, the minister for women’s health strategy, she holds her to account. The minister comes off as defensive and keen to spin the appearance into a showcase of her plan to fund women’s health hubs – where contraception advice and treatments will be available – and assure McCall that £25m has been allocated to make this a reality. McCall responds firmly: “That sounds like a lot of money, but when you’ve cut a billion pounds from health, and lots of that would have been used for sexual and reproductive health, putting £25m back in, it feels like a drop in the ocean.” As she leaves the interview, McCall is noticeably deflated. “It’s one step forward after many steps backwards.” There are some glaring gaps in the narrative. Class, race and disability aren’t really broached when it comes to access and care. Nor does the programme dive into the fact that some of the issues around contraception access are rooted in a desire to suppress women’s sexual freedom. But it is still a powerful documentary that will leave many viewers making more informed decisions about their bodies, saving them from pain – and potentially saving lives as well. And if the woman from the health centre is reading this, I’m sorry I didn’t yell. • Davina McCall’s Pill Revolution was on Channel 4 and is available on More4"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/jun/09/police-watchdog-for-england-and-wales-demands-new-powers-amid-trust-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T23:01:43Z","webTitle":"Police watchdog for England and Wales demands new powers amid trust crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/09/police-watchdog-for-england-and-wales-demands-new-powers-amid-trust-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/jun/09/police-watchdog-for-england-and-wales-demands-new-powers-amid-trust-crisis","fields":{"bodyText":"The head of the police inspectorate in England and Wales has demanded sweeping new powers to compel police forces to tackle what he described as the worst crisis in law and order in living memory. In his first annual assessment as head of His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS), Andy Cooke said there was a limited opportunity to restore public trust in police before it was irreparably damaged. “Public trust in the police hanging by a thread,” Cooke said. He said the crisis in public confidence in the police was partly due to a series of “dreadful scandals” including the murder of Sarah Everard by the serving Metropolitan police officer Wayne Couzens and the 48 rape convictions of David Carrick, another Met officer. Such scandals could have been tackled earlier if the HMICFRS had the power to compel forces to follow its recommendations rather than relying on the current system of voluntary compliance, Cooke said. He expressed frustration at repeated failures of police forces, including the Met, to act on police inspectorate warnings first raised in 2016 over officers abusing their positions with victims for sexual purposes. “In those seven years, we’ve had some truly horrendous acts by police officers,” he said as he launched the report. “I’m not saying that wouldn’t have happened if they’d done our recommendations earlier. But if I could direct around those issues, as opposed to recommending, a lot more would have been done a lot quicker.” He added: “Too often we’ve seen forces failing to act, or not acting quickly enough, to address our recommendations.” Cooke urged the government to introduce legislation to make it a legal requirement for police forces to follow directions from the inspectorate on issues of public safety. His report also demands a role for HMICFRS in the recruitment of chief constables and other senior officers to improve the calibre of police chiefs. He called for “substantial reform” of police vetting and recruitment processes, “including for chief officers”. Cooke said too much police time was being wasted filling gaps left by cuts to public services. He endorsed a plan by the Met to stop attending emergency mental health calls. “So much of policing time has been diverted to other parts of a broken system … it takes time a way from catching criminals,” he said. “Many of these other public services are under financial pressure, too, and can’t meet their own demand. For example, in 2022 the police attended 600,000 incidents relating to mental health … It is not the job for policing to treat mental health.” Cooke, a former chief constable of Merseyside police, a force he joined in 1985, said: “I can’t recall a time when the relationship between the police and public was more strained than it is now.” He complained of a “stark decline” in offences bought to justice, with the charge rate falling by two-thirds since 2015. “The police aren’t helped by a system of policing funding which is not fit for purpose and a criminal justice system which is dysfunctional and defective,” he said. He pointed out that the backlog of crown court cases had reached record levels last October. Cooke said such “widespread systemic failings” also damaged public trust in the police. In a wide-ranging report, Cooke insisted that stop and search was an effective way of deterring crime and showing police visibility on the street. But he said police leaders should explain why it had been disproportionally used against black people. He said: “That doesn’t mean that the police are being racist … There’s also more disproportionality for victims. It is four times more likely as a black man to be murdered than a young white man.” Cooke urged police forces to avoid political campaigns. “It is not their role to champion social change,” he said. “The police need to prioritise the issues that matter most to the public. Forces are failing to get the basics right.” The National Police Chiefs’ Council chair, Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, said the report highlighted the “range of challenges in meeting the needs of communities across the UK” as well as “the dedication of officers, staff and volunteers”. “Policing must continue to do more to earn back the trust and confidence of the public, which we know has been eroded over recent years,” he added. “To do so, we remain focused on preventing crime and disorder, listening to communities’ concerns … and providing consistently high-quality services in responding to emergencies, investigating crime and keeping people safe. “The report also rightly recognises the pressure on the criminal justice system and mental health services and the serious impact this has for society in accessing justice and care.” Suella Braverman, the home secretary, welcomed the report, saying: “I equally share his concern that policing needs strong leaders, a greater focus on the basics and issues that matter most to the public – and to be more visible in communities. “This is why I’ve been calling for common sense policing. With the highest number of police officers than ever before, the police must deliver for victims.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/nov/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-race-to-restore-power-and-water-in-kherson-murdered-civilians-found-zelenskiy-says","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-14T19:00:55Z","webTitle":"Biden and Xi condemn Russian nuclear threats; Zelenskiy visits liberated Kherson – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-race-to-restore-power-and-water-in-kherson-murdered-civilians-found-zelenskiy-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/nov/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-race-to-restore-power-and-water-in-kherson-murdered-civilians-found-zelenskiy-says","fields":{"bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv and Moscow. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made a visit to the newly liberated city of Kherson, where he spoke to troops. “We are moving forward,” he told them. “We are ready for peace, peace for all our country.” He also thanked Nato and other allies for their support in the war against Russia. The US president, Joe Biden, and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, have reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war “should never be fought”, the White House said. Beijing’s readout from the long-awaited meeting in Bali differed slightly and did not mention the pair agreeing on opposing Russia’s threat of using nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war. Biden said Kherson was a significant victory for Ukraine and that he was confident Russia would not occupy Ukraine as it intended. The US president said it was hard to tell at this point what the victory would mean, but that the US would continue to support Ukraine. According to Russian media sources, the Ukrainian army has entered the city of Herois’ke, in the Kinburn peninsula in the southern part of Kherson, after an amphibious operation, as heavy fighting continues across the region. The UN’s general assembly has approved a resolution calling for Russia to be held accountable for its invasion of Ukraine. Russia “must bear the legal consequences of all of its internationally wrongful acts, including making reparation for the injury, including any damage, caused by such acts”, the resolution read. There was confusion after it was reported that Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, had been hospitalised after arriving in Bali for the G20 summit. Foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova dismissed the claim as “the height of fakery” and posted a video of Lavrov sitting reading documents at his hotel. The governor of Bali said that while Lavrov was in good health, he had been in hospital for a checkup. The White House confirmed that the CIA director, William J Burns, was in Ankara in Turkey on Monday to speak with his Russian counterpart. A White House official said Ukraine was briefed in advance about the visit, that Burns was not conducting any kind of negotiations, and was conveying a message on the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons by Russia, and the risks of escalation to strategic stability. Rishi Sunak called Russia a “pariah state” on the eve of the G20 summit in Indonesia. The UK prime minister said he would take every opportunity at the talks to confront Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who is attending in Vladimir Putin’s absence. The US has announced fresh sanctions, targeting a transnational network that has been working to procure technology to support Russia’s war in Ukraine. The latest sanctions target 14 individuals and 28 entities, including family members of the Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov, as well as people that it says worked as financial facilitators in Kerimov’s network. Russia’s foreign ministry has announced it has banned entry to 100 Canadians in the latest in a series of tit-for-tat measures. They include the actor Jim Carrey and the author Margaret Atwood. The EU and its member states have so far provided weapons and military equipment worth a total of at least €8bn (£7bn) to Ukraine, according to the bloc’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. A pro-Russia tank gunner who was accused of firing into residential buildings in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason, according to Ukraine’s state security service (SBU). The pro-Russia militant, nicknamed “Phil”, had fired “at least 20 shots at residential high-rise buildings in Mariupol”, the SBU said in a statement. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thank you for following along. I’ll be back tomorrow. The UN’s general assembly has approved a resolution calling for Russia to be held accountable for its invasion of Ukraine, including by making reparations to Kyiv. The resolution, supported by 94 of the assembly’s 193 members, recognises that Russia must be held accountable for violations of international law in or against Ukraine. Russia “must bear the legal consequences of all of its internationally wrongful acts, including making reparation for the injury, including any damage, caused by such acts”, the resolution reads. Ukraine’s state railway service, Ukrzaliznytsia, has begun repairing damaged rail tracks and infrastructure on the Kherson line, according to the country’s infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov. Family members of a former Russian prison inmate who defected to Ukraine after being recruited by the Kremlin-linked private military group Wagner have expressed “horror” after a gruesome video emerged on Friday that showed him being killed by repeated blows with a sledgehammer. Footage of the killing of Yevgeny Nuzhin was posted over the weekend by the Wagner-linked Telegram channel Grey Zone. In the video, Nuzhin was shown lying down with his head taped to a brick wall as an unidentified man in combat clothing hit him with a sledgehammer. Nuzhin, 55, had been serving a 24-year prison sentence for a murder he committed in 1999, but was freed in July and conscripted into Wagner, a notorious military group run by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a powerful Russian businessman and a close ally of Vladimir Putin. Following his capture by Ukrainian forces in September, Nuzhin gave a series of interviews in the country, in which he said he had joined the Wagner group to get out of prison and that he had quickly hatched a plan to surrender to Ukraine. In the interviews, he also criticised the Russian leadership and expressed his desire to join the Ukrainian forces and fight against Moscow. Ilya Nuzhin, Yevgeny’s son, confirmed to the Guardian on Monday that the man in the video was his father but declined to give further comments, citing “security concerns”. Read the full story here: The EU and its member states have so far provided weapons and military equipment worth a total of at least €8bn (£7bn) to Ukraine, according to the bloc’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with his EU counterparts in Brussels, he said this was about 45% of what the US has supplied to Kyiv. Borrell added that the EU would “continue isolating Russia internationally” and continue imposing “restrictive measures” against Russia’s economy. Rishi Sunak has called Russia a “pariah state” on the eve of his first meeting of the G20 in Indonesia, where he has vowed to confront Moscow’s representative in public and on the sidelines of the summit. The UK prime minister said he would take every opportunity during the summit to confront Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who is attending in Vladimir Putin’s absence, and said that would be not only in the hall itself but at any opportunity if the two came face-to-face. “Russia is becoming a pariah state and he’s [Putin] not there to take responsibility for what he’s doing,” Sunak told reporters on the plane before the meeting in Bali, where he will meet Lavrov for the first time. But I’m going to use the opportunity to put on the record my condemnation of what they’re doing. I will do that in the hall, I will do that if I see him elsewhere, and that’s the right thing to do. Sunak said his opening words at the G20 would be to condemn Putin’s brutal war in Ukraine and said there was no suggestion the Russians were prepared to restart peace negotiations. Read the full story here: Russia’s foreign ministry has announced it has banned entry to 100 Canadians, including the actor Jim Carrey and author Margaret Atwood, in the latest in a series of tit-for-tat measures. In a statement, it said the Canadians added to its sanctions list included officials, business leaders and people involved with “media and financial structures that are directly involved in the formation of an aggressive anti-Russian course”. The list includes Danielle Smith, the premier of the province of Alberta; journalists at the public broadcaster CBC; and several members of the Canada-Ukraine Foundation. The announcement comes after Canada announced a new round of Russia-related sanctions on police officers, investigators, prosecutors and judges. The Russian ministry said it had decided on the new round of sanctions “in response to the practice, implemented by Justin Trudeau’s regime, of imposing sanctions against the Russian leadership, politicians and parliamentarians, business representatives, experts and journalists, cultural figures”. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, has said he is “hopeful” Russia will extend the Black Sea graininitiative. The UN is “working non-stop” to renew the “essential” deal that gives safe passage to Ukrainian grain shipments, Guterres said during a press conference at the G20 summit in Bali. Talks over the last week had delivered “a lot of progress” on the deal, which is set to expire on Saturday, he added. He said: We need urgent action to prevent famine and hunger in a growing number of places around the world. The Black Sea grain initiative, and efforts to ensure Russian food and fertilisers can flow to global markets, are essential to global food security. The US has announced fresh sanctions targeting a transnational network that has been working to procure technology to support Russia’s war in Ukraine. The sanctions target 14 individuals and 28 entities, including family members of the Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov, as well as people that it says worked as financial facilitators in Kerimov’s network. In a statement, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said: The United States will continue to disrupt Russia’s military supply chains and impose high costs on President Putin’s enablers, as well as all those who support Russia’s brutality against its neighbour. The US treasury department also blacklisted Milandr, a Russian microelectronics company that it says is part of Moscow’s military research and development structure. It has also imposed sanctions on major military industrial companies in Russia. The US commerce department has cut off exports of American-made components and US technologies that have been used in some of Russia’s military hardware. It’s 6pm in Kyiv and Moscow. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made a visit to the newly liberated city of Kherson, where he spoke to troops. “We are moving forward,” he told them. “We are ready for peace, peace for all our country.” He also thanked Nato and other allies for their support in the war against Russia. Some people waved Ukrainian flags and others had the flag draped over their shoulders as Zelenskiy addressed the crowd. “I’m really happy, you can tell by the reaction of the people, their reaction is not staged,” said Zelenskiy, who was flanked by heavily armed security guards. “The people were waiting for the Ukrainian army, for our soldiers, for all of us.” The US president, Joe Biden, and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, have reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war “should never be fought”, in a long-awaited meeting in Bali earlier today, the White House said. The pair shook hands in front of the US and Chinese flags before the three-hour meeting on the resort island and “spoke candidly” about a range of issues, including key regional and global challenges, the White House said in a statement. China’s readout from the meeting differed slightly, with the New York Times reporting: “Unlike the White House’s account, the Chinese account did not mention Xi and Biden agreeing on opposing Russia’s threat of using nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war.” In remarks to the media after his meeting with China’s president, Biden said that Kherson was a significant victory for Ukraine. Biden said it was hard to tell at this point what the victory would mean, but that the US would continue to support Ukraine. He said he was confident that Russia would not occupy Ukraine as it intended. According to Russian media sources, the Ukrainian army has entered the city of Herois’ke, in the Kinburn peninsula in the southern part of Kherson, after an amphibious operation, as heavy fighting continues across the region. Zelenskiy accused Russian soldiers of war crimes and killing civilians in Kherson. “Investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes. Bodies of dead civilians and servicemen have been found. The Russian army left behind the same savagery it did in other regions of the country it entered,” he said on Sunday. A pro-Russia tank gunner who was accused of firing into residential buildings in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason, according to Ukraine’s state security service (SBU). The pro-Russia militant, nicknamed “Phil”, had fired “at least 20 shots at residential high-rise buildings in Mariupol”, the SBU said in a statement. There was confusion after it was reported that Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, had been hospitalised after arriving in Bali for the G20 summit. Foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova dismissed the claim as “the height of fakery” and posted a video of Lavrov sitting reading documents at his hotel. In the video, Lavrov says: “This is a kind of game that is not new in politics. Western journalists need to be more truthful – they need to write the truth”. However, the governor of Bali said that while Lavrov was in good health, he had been in hospital for a checkup. The White House confirmed that the CIA director, William J Burns, was in Ankara in Turkey on Monday to speak with his Russian counterpart. A White House official said Ukraine was briefed in advance about the visit, that Burns was not conducting any kind of negotiations, and he was conveying a message on the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons by Russia, and the risks of escalation to strategic stability. The Kremlin has confirmed talks between US and Russian officials took place in Ankara today, Russian state-owned news agency Tass has reported, citing Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Here are some more images from the newly liberated city of Kherson that have been sent to us over the newswires. Zambia has asked Russia to explain how one of its citizens who had been serving a prison sentence in Moscow ended up on the battlefield in Ukraine where he was killed, Zambia’s foreign affairs minister said on Monday, Reuters reports. Stanley Kakubo said in a statement that Russia had notified Zambia about the death in September of the 23-year-old, but did not provide details. The Zambian student was serving a jail sentence at a medium security prison on the outskirts of Moscow after being convicted of contravening Russian law, Kakubo said, without specifying the offence that occurred in April 2020. “The Zambian government has requested the Russian authorities to urgently provide information on the circumstances under which a Zambian citizen, serving a prison sentence in Moscow, could have been recruited to fight in Ukraine,” Kakubo said. It was not clear how the prisoner was recruited and by whom. Reuters could not independently verify the details surrounding his death. Russia’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Canada will provide Ukraine with a further $500m (£425m) in additional military assistance in addition to sanctions on nearly two dozen more Russians, prime minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement on Monday as the G20 summit began. Reuters reports the funding is additional to the $3.4bn Canada has given to Kyiv so far for its defence against Russia’s invasion and will help fund military, surveillance and communications equipment, fuel and medical supplies, the statement said. Monday’s sanctions target 23 Russian individuals “involved in gross and systematic human rights violations against Russian opposition leaders”, including police officers, prosecutors, judges and prison officials, Trudeau’s office said. Chris Buckley at the New York Times is reporting that China’s readout of the meeting between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping differs slightly for the US account. Buckley writes: Unlike the White House’s account, the Chinese account did not mention Xi and Biden agreeing on opposing Russia’s threat of using nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war. According to the Chinese account, Xi said that “China is highly concerned with the current situation in Ukraine”. Xi also said that “a complicated issue does not have a simple solution,” and that “confrontation between major powers must be avoided.” In remarks to the media after his meeting earlier with China’s president, Xi Jinping, the US president, Joe Biden, has said that Kherson is a significant victory for Ukraine. Biden said it is hard to tell at this point what the victory will mean, but that the US will continue to support Ukraine. Reuters reports he said he is confident that Russia will not occupy Ukraine as they intended. The White House has confirmed that the CIA director, William J Burns, is in Ankara in Turkey to speak with his Russian counterpart. Reuters reports that a White House official said Ukraine was briefed in advance about the visit, and that Burns was not conducting any kind of negotiations. A national security council spokesperson told CNN: We have been very open about the fact that we have channels to communicate with Russia on managing risk, especially nuclear risk and risks to strategic stability. As part of this effort, Bill Burns is in Ankara today to meet with his Russian intelligence counterpart. He is not discussing settlement of the war in Ukraine. He is conveying a message on the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons by Russia, and the risks of escalation to strategic stability. He will also raise the cases of unjustly detained US citizens. US president Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war “should never be fought” in a long-awaited meeting in Bali earlier today, the White House said. The pair shook hands in front of the US and Chinese flags ahead of the three-hour meeting on the resort island and “spoke candidly” about a range of issues, including key regional and global challenges, the White House said in a statement. It said: President Biden raised Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine and Russia’s irresponsible threats of nuclear use. President Biden and President Xi reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war should never be fought and can never be won and underscored their opposition to the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. The two leaders held their first face-to-face talks since Biden took office on the sidelines of the G20 summit. The US and China shared the responsibility to show the world that they can “manage our differences, prevent competition from becoming conflict”, Biden said. Britain’s prime minister Rishi Sunak, who is in Bali for the G20 summit, said he would use the opportunity to “unequivocally condemn” Russia’s war in Ukraine. He told broadcasters: I’m going to use this opportunity to unequivocally condemn Russia’s hostile and illegal war in Ukraine. And I know that other allies will as well because it’s right that we highlight what is going on and hold Russia to account for that and I won’t shy away from doing that you accept. Sunak appeared to acknowledge that the G20 was divided on the issue of explicitly condemning Russia’s war in Ukraine: The G20 is a very different forum to the G7 for example. The G7 is a group of like-minded liberal democracies with similar values. The G20, we have to acknowledge, is a different grouping. But that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t be engaged in it. We should make our voices heard and constructively work with people where we can to make a difference for people at home as well. And you saw that recently, when it came to migration, the ability to talk to other countries can have benefits for people at home and that’s what I’m here to deliver. A pro-Russian tank gunner who was accused of firing into residential buildings in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason, according to Ukraine’s state security service (SBU). The pro-Russian militant, nicknamed “Phil”, had fired “at least 20 shots at residential high-rise buildings in Mariupol”, the SBU said in a statement. The statement said: The Security Service of Ukraine collected indisputable evidence of crimes committed by the militant of the ‘DPR’ [Donetsk People’s Republic] terrorist organisation nicknamed ‘Phil’. The evidence allowed the court to imprison him for 12 years. The man was captured by Ukrainian forces near the eastern village of Rivnopil in April after his tank came under attack. He was found guilty of high treason and the “creation of unauthorised armed groups or participation in its activities”, the SBU said. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy spent 30 minutes on Monday morning visiting Kherson, days after Russian troops withdrew. Addressing Ukrainian soldiers in front of the administration building in the main square, Zelenskiy said: We are moving forward. We are ready for peace, peace for all our country. The president sang the Ukrainian national anthem as the country’s blue and yellow flag was hoisted in the southern city. According to Russian media sources, the Ukrainian army has entered the city of Herois’ke, in the Kinburn Peninsula, following an amphibious operation, as heavy fighting continues across the region. On Sunday, there were “unconfirmed reports’’ that Ukrainian forces were about to launch a “small-scale amphibious operation” on the peninsula, in Biloberezhia Sviatoslava national park, which connects to Russian-occupied territory on the eastern side of the Dnipro River. Ukrainian troops are likely to continue consolidating control of the western bank in the coming days. A draft resolution by the UN’s nuclear watchdog, seen by Reuters, calls on Russia to cease all actions against Ukraine’s nuclear facilities including the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The draft of what would be the third resolution by the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) 35-nation board of governors reads: (The board) calls upon the Russian Federation to abandon its baseless claims of ownership of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, to immediately withdraw its military and other personnel from the plant, and to cease all actions against, and at, the plant and any other nuclear facility in Ukraine. The wording of the draft is similar to that of the two previous resolutions passed in March and September. Both resolutions were passed with large majorities, with only Russia and China opposing them. We have just arrived in a small, coastal village, named Kobleve, in the region of Mykolaiv, facing the vast Black Sea. Crimea is “only’” 140km away from here. Just yesterday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy suggested that Crimea, illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014, is an active Ukrainian military target and that, after the liberation of Kherson, the Ukrainians could try to take it back. “We will definitely reach our state border – all sections of the internationally recognised border of Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said. The beach and sea are infested with hundreds of mines placed by both sides in Russia’s war on Ukraine, posing a serious threat to people. The Ukrainian government has banned coastal bathing. Experts agree it will take years to de-mine the Black Sea. The Russian president Vladimir Putin’s aim is to “leave Ukraine cold and dark this winter”, Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. Russia’s withdrawal from Kherson demonstrates the “incredible courage” of Ukraine’s armed forces, the military alliance chief said during a press conference with members of the Dutch government in The Hague. It is up to Ukraine to decide what terms are acceptable for negotiations to bring an end to the war, he said, adding Nato’s role was to support Kyiv. Stoltenberg said: We should not make the mistake of underestimating Russia. The Russian armed forces retain significant capabilities, as well as a large number of troops and Russia has demonstrated the willingness to bear significant losses. They have also shown extreme brutality. He added: The coming months will be difficult. Putin’s aim is to leave Ukraine cold and dark this winter. So we must stay the course. Andriy Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, has shared a video showing the Ukrainian president singing the national anthem as the flag of Ukraine is raised over the city of Kherson. Kirill Stremousov was in the mood for a chat. A political marginal on the fringes of society just six months ago, he was clearly relishing the newfound attention he was receiving as the public face of Russia’s occupation of Ukraine’s Kherson region. “I am on a constant high,” the Moscow-installed official told the Guardian in a phone interview in August. We have won. I am living in a dream. Russia is in Kherson for ever. That “for ever” ended abruptly on Wednesday, when Stremousov, 45, was killed in a car crash as he was speeding away from Kherson. By that time, he was already fully aware that his dream of a Russian Kherson would soon be torn apart as Ukrainian troops were closing in to liberate the city. On Friday evening, in remarkable scenes, crowds of jubilant residents greeted Ukraine’s armed forces as they reached the centre of Kherson. Stremousov’s rise and fall is a story of how one man’s ruthless opportunism and ideological fantasies can play out in a war-torn country. It also serves to demonstrate how thuggish and unsavoury characters thrive in Russia today as the country’s leadership embraces anti-western hysteria. Read the full story here: On Sunday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russian soldiers of war crimes and killing civilians in Kherson. He said: Investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes. Bodies of dead civilians and servicemen have been found. The Russian army left behind the same savagery it did in other regions of the country it entered. After two nights of jubilation after the liberation of their city, on Sunday Kherson residents began to assess the extent of the damage wreaked by eight long months of Russian occupation, with many homes still without electricity and water. A Turkish official has declined to comment on a report that Russian and US delegations were holding talks in the Turkish capital, Ankara. The Russian newspaper Kommersant reported that officials from the two countries were meeting today, citing a source. The paper claimed that Sergei Naryshkin, head of Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence agency, was reportedly part of the Russian delegation. The Kremlin said it could neither confirm nor deny the story. Hello everyone. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments on the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy spent 30 minutes on Monday morning visiting the newly liberated city of Kherson, days after Russian troops withdrew from the city over the River Dnipro to the southern portion of the Kherson region. Addressing troops in front of the administration building in the main square, the president said: “We are moving forward. We are ready for peace, peace for all our country.” Russian forces destroyed key infrastructure in Ukraine’s southern city of Kherson before retreating, Zelenskiy had said in his nightly address. Russia troops “destroyed all the critical infrastructure: communications, water, heat, electricity”, he said. Kherson’s mayor said the humanitarian situation was “severe” because of a lack of water, medicine and bread. Zelenskiy said authorities had dealt with nearly 2,000 mines, tripwires and unexploded shells left by Russian troops. Ukrainians hailed Russia’s retreat from Kherson as Kyiv said it was working to de-mine the strategic southern city and restore power across the region. In the formerly occupied villages of Pravdyne and Snihurivka, outside Kherson, returning locals embraced returning troops and their neighbours, some unable to hold back tears. “Victory, finally!” one said. The head of Kherson’s regional state administration said everything was being done to “return normal life” to the area. Speaking from Kherson city in a video poster to social media, Yaroslav Yanushevych said that while de-mining was carried out, a curfew had been put in place and movement in and out of the city had been limited. Zelenskiy added that 226 settlements in the Kherson region will be restored, encompassing more than 100,000 local residents. Ukraine can “feel the approach of our victory” he added in his latest national address. Zelenskiy accused Russian soldiers of war crimes and killing civilians in Kherson. “Investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes. Bodies of dead civilians and servicemen have been found. The Russian army left behind the same savagery it did in other regions of the country it entered,” he said on Sunday. There was confusion after it was reported that Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov had been hospitalised after arriving in Bali for the G20 summit. Foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova dismissed the claim as “the height of fakery”, and posted a video of Lavrov sitting reading documents at his hotel. In the video, Lavrov says: “This is a kind of game that is not new in politics. Western journalists need to be more truthful – they need to write the truth”. However, the governor of Bali said that while Lavrov was in good health, he had been in hospital for a check-up. The EU’s top diplomat has said Ukraine will decide when to enter talks with Russia, amid growing speculation that western capitals will pressure Kyiv into negotiations. Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, said: “Ukraine will decide what to do. Our duty is to support them.” He was arriving for the monthly meeting of EU foreign ministers, which will be focused on the war in Ukraine. Borrell said the Russian retreat and recapture of Kherson by Ukraine was “very good news” and showed the EU’s strategy of military support was the right one. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back with you later on. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you shortly. Vladimir Putin’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters this morning that the Russian president would not be going to Bali to the G20 summit because “circumstances dictate the priority of the president being in the Russian Federation”, according to a report from the state-owned Tass news agency. The Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, spent 30 minutes on Monday morning visiting the newly liberated city of Kherson, days after Russian troops withdrew from the city over the River Dnipro to the southern portion of the Kherson region. Reuters reports that he addressed troops in front of the administration building in the main square. He said: “We are moving forward. We are ready for peace, peace for all our country.” He thanked Nato and other allies for their support in the war against Russia and said the delivery of high-mobility artillery rocket systems (Himars) from the US had made a big difference to Ukraine’s war effort. Parents with children, some pushing baby strollers, also gathered in the main square in front of the administration building that until recently was occupied by Russian forces. Some people waved Ukrainian flags and others had the flag draped over their shoulders. “I’m really happy, you can tell by the reaction of the people, their reaction is not staged,” said Zelenskiy, who was flanked by heavily armed security guards. “The people were waiting for the Ukrainian army, for our soldiers, for all of us.” He said it was important to visit Kherson to show support for residents who endured about eight months of Russian occupation and to demonstrate to them that “we are really returning, we really raise our flag”. Asked by reporters where Ukrainian forces might advance next, he said: “Not Moscow … We’re not interested in the territories of another country.” Kherson is one of the regions of Ukraine that the Russian Federation has claimed to annex, despite not controlling the territory. On his official Telegram channel, Zelenskiy posted a series of images from the trip, accompanied with the simple messages “Kherson – Ukraine 🇺🇦” and “Our heroes 🇺🇦” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted a series of photographs of his visit to Kherson on his Telegram channel with the simple message “Kherson – Ukraine 🇺🇦” in Ukrainian and English. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has tweeted that the EU is increasing the amount of money it is devoting to supporting food security, saying: “Putin’s war is bringing millions to the brink of starvation.” Here is a short video clip of the Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kherson. The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has just posted a video to her Telegram account that appears to show Sergei Lavrov working at a table outside his hotel suite in Bali and reacting to the news that he is reported to be in hospital. Reuters reports that in the video, Lavrov says: “This is a kind of game that is not new in politics. Western journalists need to be more truthful – they need to write the truth.” However, the governor of Bali has said that Lavrov was in good health, and had been in hospital for a check-up. While there continues to be some confusion about Sergei Lavrov in Bali, it is definite that Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited Kherson, and we have just received some images from his trip. According to Reuters, it is Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova who has dismissed the claim that Sergei Lavrov was hospitalised in Bali. “This, of course, is the height of fakery,” Reuters report her saying. Reuters is reporting that the Russian foreign ministry has dismissed the earlier Associated Press claim that Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov was hospitalised in Bali as “fake news”. More details soon … Russian media including RIA Novosti and Tass are this morning carrying allegations of mistreatment of Russian prisoners of war by their Ukrainian captors. In particular, they are carrying quotes from the press service of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation in which a Russian soldier alleges he was buried alive as part of an interrogation. According to the RIA report, the committee alleges: One of the released soldiers said that the Ukrainian servicemen tied his hands and feet, put a bag over his head and did not take it off for several days. During this time he was beaten. In addition, due to dissatisfaction with the answers to their questions, the nationalists put a gun to his head and threatened to shoot and bury him. “They fulfilled the last threat by throwing the prisoner to the bottom of the trench and covering it with earth. The threat of deprivation of life was so real that only after lying in this position for about five hours did he realise that he would live,” the department noted. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has visited the newly liberated city of Kherson, days after a Russian troop withdrawal from the southern Ukrainian city after months of occupation, a Reuters witness said. “We are moving forward,” he told troops. “We are ready for peace, peace for all our country.” He thanked Nato and other allies for their support in the war against Russia. Associated Press have a quick snap to say that according to Indonesian officials, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov was taken to hospital after arriving for the G20 summit in Bali. More details soon … Reuters has a quick snap that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has visited the newly liberated city of Kherson. More details soon … Viacheslav Chaus, the governor of Chernihiv, has posted to Telegram to say that in the last week de-mining efforts in the region had removed 377 explosive objects. The Chernihiv region is to the north of Kyiv, and was one of the areas Russia attacked in February from Belarus in its failed attempt to capture Ukraine’s capital city. Jennifer Rankin reports for the Guardian from Brussels: The EU’s top diplomat has said Ukraine will decide when to enter talks with Russia, amid growing speculation that western capitals will pressure Kyiv into negotiations. Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, said: “Ukraine will decide what to do. Our duty is to support them.” He was arriving for the monthly meeting of EU foreign ministers, which will be focused on the war in Ukraine. Borrell said the Russian retreat and recapture of Kherson by Ukraine was “very good news” and showed the EU’s strategy of military support was the right one. He claimed that EU military support was greater than some reports suggested, amid growing frustration from EU capitals that the bloc’s efforts are not being recognised vis-a-vis US aid. “I think it’s very important to put the right figures on the table,” Borrell said, promising further details later. EU foreign ministers are set to agree further sanctions against prominent Iranians, in response to the violent crackdown on human rights and will also discuss Teheran’s role in supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine. Borrell said the bloc had no evidence Iran was supplying Russia with missiles, although there is some concern this may be the case. Last month, the EU sanctioned four Iranians involved in supplying lethal drones used by Russia to attack Ukraine. Here are some more images from the newly liberated city of Kherson that have been sent to us over the newswires. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, reports that overnight in the areas of the region controlled by Ukraine, two people were injured, and that one house, seven high-rise buildings, a kindergarten and an administrative building were damaged by shelling from pro-Russian forces. Donetsk is one of the regions of occupied Ukraine that Russia has claimed to annex following a “referendum”, despite not fully controlling the territory. In the FT this morning, Henry Foy and Mercedes Ruehl have a bleak assessment of the likelihood of unity over the war in Ukraine at the G20 summit in Bali this week. They write: “This really is the first G20 to take place after the end of the post-cold war era. You know, this is a new world,” said Charles Kupchan, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think-tank. “We’re back in a global landscape in which there is militarised rivalry between the west and Russia. And that rivalry is now extending to China. And as a consequence, the ability of the G20 to function as a co-operative body is very much called into question.” “I would not want to be the Indonesians in the sense that you really are hosting a meeting that is taking place against the backdrop of a level of ideological and geopolitical division that we haven’t seen since the Berlin Wall came down,” said Kupchan, who was special assistant to former US president Barack Obama. “There will be no agreement on language condemning Russia’s war in Ukraine,” said a senior German official of the G20, echoing downbeat assessments from other western delegations. In closed-door meetings to draft the summit communiqué, China has maintained its strong support for Russia, stymying efforts by western officials to include language condemning the war. Hanna Arhirova is in Kherson for Agence France-Presse, and she has spoken to 73-year-old Yevhen Teliezhenko. He and his wife have been driving around the city, flying their Ukrainian flag and asking the soldiers who liberated them to autograph it. “They were fighting for us. We knew we were not alone,” he said. “Finally freedom!” said 61-year-old Tetiana Hitina, Teliezhenko’s wife. “The city was dead.” Karina Zaikina, 24, said that in the final days before they finished their pullout last week, Russian troops grew increasingly nervous and rumours flew around the city “They were stealing and morally pressuring us,” she said. “It was clear that they were scared because they all walked only in groups.” “I woke up calm today,” she added. “For the first time in many months, I wasn’t scared to go to the city.” The UK’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, interviewed on Sky News, has absolutely ruled out normalising the country’s relationship with Russia during the course of the G20 summit. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. I will be with you for the next few hours. Winter will bring a change in conflict conditions, including fewer offensives and more static defensive frontlines and a greater risk of weapon malfunctions, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. Changes to daylight hours, temperature and weather will present unique challenges for fighting soldiers. A reduction in daylight hours will result in fewer offensives and more static defensive frontlines, the latest British intelligence report suggests. Night vision capability will also be a precious commodity, further exacerbating the unwillingness to fight at night. As temperatures drop, forces lacking in winter weather clothing and accommodation are highly likely to suffer from non-freezing cold injuries, the ministry adds. Additionally, the “golden hour” window in which to save a critically wounded soldier is reduced by approximately half, making the risk of contact with the enemy much greater. An increase in rainfall, wind speed and snowfall will provide additional challenges to the already low morale of Russian forces and also present problems for kit maintenance. Basic drills such as weapon cleaning must be adjusted to the conditions and the risk of weapon malfunctions increase. New Zealand will send a further 66 defence force personnel to the UK to help train Ukrainian soldiers. New Zealand has a team of 120 defence force (NZDF) personnel training Ukrainians in the UK but this deployment was due to end. The deployment will run from 30 November until July 2023, a government statement said. “I am pleased the NZDF infantry can offer the skills and experience for further training. This deployment also provides an opportunity for NZDF personnel to gain valuable experience,” said Peeni Henare, minister of defence, on Monday. The New Zealand government has also said it would extend the NZDF’s existing intelligence contribution, redeploy four NZDF staff to help with the logistics hub in Europe and provide eight people to support those deployed in the region. No NZDF staff will be sent into Ukraine. The government said it will donate NZ$1.85m ($1.13m) to the World Food Programme to help address global food security and NZ$1.85m to the Nato Trust fund. Images of local residents embracing returning Ukrainian soldiers as they celebrated the liberation of towns and villages throughout Kherson have emerged on our newswires today. Many were reunited for the first time since Russian troops occupied the region in southern Ukraine. The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has said the US will impose fresh sanctions on a transnational network of individuals and companies that have been working to procure military technologies for Russia’s war effort in Ukraine. Yellen told reporters on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali the sanctions would target 14 individuals and 28 entities, including financial facilitators, but she declined to provide details on where they were located. She said the announcement was scheduled for later on Monday, according to Reuters. This is part of our larger effort to disrupt Russia’s war effort and deny equipment it needs through sanctions and export controls,” Yellen told reporters. She declined to provide details on which technologies the sanctions would target in an effort to cut off Russian purchases. The US Treasury has sanctioned major military industrial firms in Russia and the Commerce Department has cut off exports of American-made components and US technologies that have been used in some of Russia’s military hardware. A family of four, including an 11-year-old child, has reportedly been killed after the car they were travelling in run over a landmine in the Kherson region. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office, reported the deaths on Sunday evening in a post on his Telegram channel. Tymoshenko said the family hit a landmine in the village of Novoraisk on Sunday, resulting in the fatal explosion. Ukrainian authorities are scrambling to return basic services to those living in Kherson after the retreating Russian army blew up all major infrastructure, leaving residents without electricity and water. Russian troops “destroyed all the critical infrastructure: communications, water, heat, electricity” president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest national address. Kherson’s mayor said the humanitarian situation was “severe” because of a lack of water, medicine and bread while Zelenskiy said authorities were dealing with thousands of mines, tripwires and unexploded shells left by Russian troops. Roman Golovnya, an adviser to the city’s local administration, said: “Russian occupying forces and collaborators did everything possible to make those people who remained in the city suffer as much as possible during these days, weeks and months of waiting.” The head of Kherson’s regional state administration said everything was being done to “return normal life” to the area. Speaking from Kherson city in a video poster to social media, Yaroslav Yanushevych said that while de-mining was carried out, a curfew had been put in place and movement in and out of the city had been limited. Retreating Russian forces reportedly destroyed Kherson city’s communications, electricity, water, heat, a 100-metre-tall TV tower and at least four bridges. Ukrainians also accused Russians of blowing up dozens of schools across the province, further damaging the prospects of children who have already missed nine months of lessons. Zelenskiy added that 226 settlements in the Kherson region will be restored, encompassing more than 100,000 local residents. On Sunday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russian soldiers of war crimes and killing civilians in Kherson. Investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes. Bodies of dead civilians and servicemen have been found. The Russian army left behind the same savagery it did in other regions of the country it entered,” he said. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. Ukrainian authorities are scrambling to de-mine the strategic southern city of Kherson and restore power across the region after the retreating Russian army blew up all major infrastructure, leaving residents without electricity and water. Kherson’s mayor said the humanitarian situation was “severe” because of a lack of water, medicine and bread while Zelenskiy said authorities were dealing with thousands of mines, tripwires and unexploded shells left by Russian troops. Volodymyr Zelenskiy also accused Russian soldiers of war crimes and killing civilians in Kherson. “Investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes. Bodies of dead civilians and servicemen have been found. The Russian army left behind the same savagery it did in other regions of the country it entered,” the Ukrainian president said. For any updates or feedback you wish to share, please feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter. If you have just joined us, here are all the latest developments: Russian forces destroyed key infrastructure in Ukraine’s southern city of Kherson before retreating, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Russia troops “destroyed all the critical infrastructure: communications, water, heat, electricity”, he said in his latest national address. Kherson’s mayor said the humanitarian situation was “severe” because of a lack of water, medicine and bread. Zelenskiy said authorities had dealt with nearly 2,000 mines, tripwires and unexploded shells left by Russian troops. Ukrainians hailed Russia’s retreat from Kherson as Kyiv said it was working to de-mine the strategic southern city and restore power across the region. In the formerly occupied villages of Pravdyne and Snihurivka, outside Kherson, returning locals embraced returning troops and their neighbours, some unable to hold back tears. “Victory, finally!” one said. The head of Kherson’s regional state administration said everything was being done to “return normal life” to the area. Speaking from Kherson city in a video poster to social media, Yaroslav Yanushevych said that while de-mining was carried out, a curfew had been put in place and movement in and out of the city had been limited. Zelenskiy added that 226 settlements in the Kherson region will be restored, encompassing more than 100,000 local residents. Ukraine can “feel the approach of our victory”, he added in his latest national address. Zelenskiy accused Russian soldiers of war crimes and killing civilians in Kherson. “Investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes. Bodies of dead civilians and servicemen have been found. The Russian army left behind the same savagery it did in other regions of the country it entered,” he said on Sunday. Significant new damage to the major Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine, which the Russians attempted to blow up during their withdrawal from nearby Kherson, was seen via satellite imagery from US company Maxar. Ukrainian authorities are trying to assess the damage and it is not clear if the structural integrity of the reservoir is at risk. With a water volume of 18.2 cubic km, the reservoir could flood a huge area, including the city of Kherson, if destroyed. Pro-Moscow forces are putting up a fierce fight in the eastern Donetsk region. “Battles in Donetsk region are just as intense as they have been in previous days,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. “The level of Russian attacks has not declined. And the level of our resilience and courage is at its highest. We will not allow them through our defence.” The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said some sanctions on Russia could remain in place even after any peace agreement with Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal reported. Yellen said that any eventual peace agreement would involve a review of the penalties the US and its allies have imposed on Russia’s economy, according to the Journal. “I suppose in the context of some peace agreement, adjustment of sanctions is possible and could be appropriate,” Yellen said in an interview in Indonesia, where she is attending the G20 summit. Russia’s education minister, Sergey Kravstov, has said that military training will return to Russian schools next September, according to the latest update by the UK’s Ministry of Defence. The programme is supported by Russia’s Ministry of Defence, which states that no less than 140 hours per academic year should be devoted to this training. Ukraine will decide on the timing and contents of any negotiation framework with Russia, according to a readout of a meeting between the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, at the Asean summit in Cambodia in Phnom Penh. Vladimir Putin has spoken to his Iranian counterpart, Ebrahim Raisi, by phone and both leaders placed emphasis on deepening political, trade and economic cooperation, the Kremlin said in a statement on Saturday. The discussion of “a number of topical issues on the bilateral agenda” also including the transport and logistics sector, the Kremlin said. It did not say when the phone call took place and made no mention of Iranian arms supplies to Moscow. Russia said there was no agreement yet to extend a deal allowing Ukraine to export grain via the Black Sea, repeating its insistence on unhindered access to world markets for its own food and fertiliser exports, Reuters reported. Ukraine has used the Cop27 climate talks to address how Russia’s invasion is causing an environmental as well as humanitarian catastrophe, with fossil fuels a key catalyst of the country’s destruction."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/apr/09/toheeb-jimoh-i-look-for-the-good-in-situations-the-power-ted-lasso","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-09T09:00:47Z","webTitle":"‘I look for the good in all situations’: The Power’s Toheeb Jimoh","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/09/toheeb-jimoh-i-look-for-the-good-in-situations-the-power-ted-lasso","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/09/toheeb-jimoh-i-look-for-the-good-in-situations-the-power-ted-lasso","fields":{"bodyText":"If early Lockdown One was dominated, in televisual terms, by Netflix’s weird and amoral documentary Tiger King, then the middle phase belonged to Ted Lasso. When its first episode dropped on Apple TV+ in August 2020, the premise felt familiar and unchallenging. It was a comedy – even sillier, a sports comedy – about an American coach played by the always-likable Jason Sudeikis, who is parachuted in to save a struggling English Premier League football team, AFC Richmond. Cue lots of fish-out-of-water gags, soccer-football misunderstandings and a narrative arc that ultimately sees the perennial underdogs bite back. Ted Lasso was all that, but it emerged that it was a lot more, too. Much like Lasso himself, the show won over doubters with waves of relentless positivity and an underlying message that kindness prevails. “It tricks you with the whole sports comedy part of it, right?” says Toheeb Jimoh, who plays AFC Richmond linchpin Sam Obisanya. “It becomes a way to Trojan horse these really interesting characters and truths about us through the guise of, ‘Oh, it’s just this zany comedy about football and Americans and British people.’ And you can’t look past the fact that we were all locked at home, no one could see their parents or hug each other. It came at a really important time for…” he stops and laughs: “the world! But we couldn’t have known that when we were making it. There was just some universe magic dust sprinkled over it.” Sam, like the show, has also shown unexpected depth. In the first season, he was reserved and insular: a young Nigerian kid in England struggling to find his way on the pitch or off it. But in the second he blossomed, becoming an integral part of Richmond’s success on the pitch, and starting an unlikely but heartwarming relationship with the team’s steely owner Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham). In one episode, he leads a player revolt against Dubai Air, Richmond’s main sponsor, because it is owned by a company that refused to clear up an oil spill in Nigeria. Although he was pretty well unknown when he was cast in Ted Lasso, it quickly became clear to everyone on set that Jimoh was a special talent, according to his co-star Brett Goldstein, who plays the team’s Roy Keane-esque enforcer, Roy Kent. “Working with Toheeb is like what it must have been like working with George Clooney on ER,” Goldstein said last year. “It’s like, you’re doing a good job, but you’re not George Clooney. This guy’s going to be Batman.” Jimoh, a 25-year-old who grew up mostly in Brixton, south London, shakes his head when he re-hears the compliment. He’s not been cast as Batman (yet), but he excelled in the 2020 BBC film Anthony, about a black teenager murdered in a racist attack in 2005, and he is about to star in a new Amazon Prime series, The Power, a supernatural thriller based on Naomi Alderman’s bestselling novel. He pulls out his phone, which has a screensaver of him and Goldstein mugging for a selfie. “Brett needs to stop saying that, because he’s clearly the George Clooney of our show,” says Jimoh. “I’m obsessed with that man. He could be a dickhead, because he’s won two Emmys now, but he’s just the sweetest, kindest guy.” To be fair, Jimoh, who was nominated for an Emmy last year for his performance in the show himself, is very much not a dickhead either: attentive, polite, quick with a disarming smile. He puts at least some of this down to working on Ted Lasso, now in its third season. “Especially in this season, you can see little Teds in all the players and even the management group,” says Jimoh; the effect is compounded by the fact that on the morning we meet, off-duty, he’s wearing a quilted AFC Richmond Barbour jacket, given to the cast during the first season. “The Lasso way is there. Everybody’s taken it. And if I’m ever out and somebody stops me, I can’t not be Sam. They kind of require me to smile and be happy.” So, that’s not what Jimoh is really like then? “No, no, I’m miserable,” he replies, with a stern face. “I’m a miserable, horrible guy.” But he can’t keep it up and starts sniggering. “A lot of the story is that you can be the cynical version of yourself, or you can stay open and look for the good in situations. And I’ve tried to take that on in my life and in my career.” Jimoh has a broad grin now. “I can’t talk about the show without smiling.” Part of the reason that Jimoh has taken to Sam Obisanya, he thinks, is that Sam’s experience mirrors his own. Jimoh was born in the UK, but his parents returned to Nigeria with him when he was one and stayed for six years. That’s when they moved back, this time to Brixton, to a “two-up, two-down” where they still live today. And that was Jimoh’s home too until recently, when he moved into a flat nearby with his brother and cousin. “We don’t have a couch or a dining table,” he says. “Literally, we’re just sat on counter stools and beds, and there’s a TV. That’s it. But really enjoying it… just having to deal with adult stuff. If I don’t do something, it doesn’t get done. Yeah, being an adult sucks.” As the attention has blown up with Ted Lasso, Jimoh credits his family with keeping him grounded, especially his dad: “I could have won 15 Oscars, 17 Baftas, a Grammy and a Golden Globe, and my dad would have just been, ‘Yep, it’s good.’” Jimoh’s older brother, who works in IT, is his main wingman when he is invited to sit in the front rows of fashion shows or go to parties in the Hollywood Hills. “We went to Egypt for a Dior show and I took my brother with me,” recalls Jimoh. “He’s got long hair, plaits, but he took his hair out and had a big afro. And I ran into Naomi Campbell and she thought he was one of the models, I think because he just had a similar look to the rest of them. And she was like, ‘Oh, I wish I could have done a walk in front of the pyramids in Egypt for one of my first shows.’ And I cottoned on and was like, ‘Nah, he’s a computer guy!’ So I fumbled the bag for him with Naomi Campbell.” Jimoh did bits and pieces of acting growing up, but making a career from it seemed like a long shot. He concentrated more on his studies, and was head boy of his secondary, the Norwood School – until he was stripped of the position. “I got caught selling sweets in the playground,” he says. “It was that time when Jamie Oliver was like, ‘You guys can’t have sweets,’ because of sugar and obesity and all that. And the kids, they all wanted sweets. I went to the head teacher and she said: ‘We’re legally not allowed to do that.’ So I just started slinging sweets, bro! Also I needed to pay my way through drama school auditions.” The scandal didn’t hold Jimoh back, and he won a place at the Guildhall School of Music &amp; Drama in London. It was only when he arrived there that he realised how ridiculous his odds had been. “You know, 3,000, 4,000 kids apply to drama school for 26 places,” he says. “And I was dumb enough to think that I could be one of them.” Also, to put it bluntly, Jimoh’s ethnicity didn’t help him. “If you’re talking dark-skinned black boys, I was the only one in my year,” he goes on. “It’s changing now, but back then you would notice a trend of ‘OK, there’s one dark-skinned black kid, there’s one light-skinned girl or one light-skinned boy in a class.’ If I got into a drama school, somebody who looked exactly like me probably wouldn’t get into that same drama school because there’s already one of me.” That Jimoh has gone on to have so much success so quickly, is, he reasons modestly, down to some lucky breaks. “It’s moments like this where you go, ‘This isn’t entirely me, I’m not responsible for this,’” he says. “I’m just being put in great positions and I’m a hard worker and it just clicks. Yeah, I don’t have an answer for that.” The Power, a nine-part series that starts this month, is set to be another big ticket. The show documents a world, not dissimilar to our own, in which women are suddenly able to release electrical jolts from their fingertips. It starts with a handful of teenage girls, but “the power” spreads and soon women become the dominant gender. Jimoh plays Tunde, a Nigerian video journalist, whose reports spread word of the phenomenon. Tunde is the main male protagonist in the show, in a cast that also includes Toni Collette and Moana’s Auli’i Cravalho. The Power was also female-led off-screen, with an all-women writers’ room and female directors. “Especially after Ted Lasso, it was nice to not be surrounded by smelly boys,” says Jimoh. “That show was the most testosterone-fuelled environment. If you want to grow a Y chromosome, come to our rehearsal room. It’s almost the opposite on The Power.” There’s no word yet if there will be a second season of The Power, but don’t be surprised if there is: the first series covers less than half of Alderman’s book. Ted Lasso’s future is less certain: when it launched Sudeikis was adamant that it would be three series and out. Whether that has changed, Jimoh isn’t telling. “Shooting this season, it feels like there’s a closing of sorts,” he says. “Whether that’s closing of chapter one, or whether that’s the closing of the book of Ted Lasso, I don’t know. That’s up to them. But there are avenues, if we wanted to carry on.” For Jimoh, meanwhile, America beckons. “It does seem like my career is drawing me towards there,” he says. But he has other ambitions, closer to home. This summer he will be Romeo in the Almeida Theatre’s hyped production of Romeo and Juliet and ever since drama school he’s been writing a play, loosely autobiographical, called Chameleon Boy. It tells the story of a young man with African roots and the code-switching he has had to effect to find a place in modern Britain. “I’m finding now, as I grow, just where I fit in all of this,” says Jimoh. “But I will say that being a black Brit, a Londoner, a Nigerian – all that stuff doesn’t feel like separate things to me any more. They feel like they’re all merging into this one culture that I share with Dave or Stormzy or Marcus Rashford. We’re all finding this thing where we’re not in-between things. We’re here.” The Power is streaming now on Amazon Prime Stylist Vivian Nwonka; assistant Scott Hobson-Jones; groomer Courtney-Reece Scott using AJ Crimson, Kiehl’s, Fenty Beauty and Mac"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2023/jan/11/call-to-end-forced-installation-of-uk-prepayment-meters-after-millions-suffer-without-power","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-11T22:15:29Z","webTitle":"Call to end forced installation of UK prepayment meters after millions suffer without power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jan/11/call-to-end-forced-installation-of-uk-prepayment-meters-after-millions-suffer-without-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2023/jan/11/call-to-end-forced-installation-of-uk-prepayment-meters-after-millions-suffer-without-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Ministers are being urged to stop the forced installation of prepayment meters after revelations that 3.2 million people – the equivalent of one person every 10 seconds – were left with cold and dark homes last year as they ran out of credit. As energy prices surged this winter, suppliers have stepped up the use of court warrants to force their way into homes to install prepayment meters, with some magistrates approving hundreds of applications at a time. For homes with smart meters, the change can be made remotely without even needing a warrant. An estimated 600,000 people were forced to make the switch away from credit meters after racking up debt with their energy supplier in 2022, compared with 380,000 in 2021, according to a major report by Citizens Advice, which is calling for an immediate ban on the use of court warrants. The charity fears a further 160,000 people could be switched by the end of winter if no further action is taken. “There must be a total ban on energy companies forcing those already at breaking point on to prepayment meters,” said Clare Moriarty, the chief executive of Citizens Advice. “If the energy regulator doesn’t act, the government must intervene.” Campaigners are warning of “disconnection by the back door”, with suppliers protecting their bottom line as consumers faced with cost of living rises struggle to top up and are cut off from heating and power. Prepay meters charge for energy at a higher rate than contracts where the customer pays monthly or by direct debit, and people in debt are often left with no choice but to “self-disconnect”. For many, running out of credit is not a one-off event. More than 2 million people are being disconnected at least once a month, according to the report. A fifth of those on prepay report going without heat or light for at least 24 hours, unable to cook or wash. Citizens Advice said more people sought its help because they couldn’t top up in 2022 than in the previous 10 years combined. The charity has gathered a series of anonymised accounts from Britons battling to keep the lights on, including: Rhiannon, a single parent with a baby who suffers from depression, fell behind on her payments after she separated with her partner. Her landlord allowed her supplier access to fit a prepayment meter. She has resorted to warming baby milk at her GP’s surgery and staying warm in her dad’s car. Rona uses a wheelchair and lives with her daughter who has special educational needs. She is reliant on family to go to the Post Office to top up and was left without heating, lighting or means to make food over Christmas. Alice, a woman with a lung condition who was moved on to a prepayment meter due to debt and couldn’t afford to top up. Her supplier told her she could not be helped again because she had been helped before, but being cut off prevents her charging her breathing machine. Andy, a diabetic who was moved on to a prepayment meter and left without power for a week despite needing to keep his insulin in the fridge. Under the terms of their licence, suppliers are not allowed to move customers on to a prepayment meter if they have an illness or disability which means they would be harmed if their gas or electricity was cut off. Suppliers have also signed up to a commitment to avoid cutting off anyone who is on a pension, disabled, chronically sick or has children over winter. However, there are holes in the safety net. Disabled and vulnerable people already on prepay have been left without energy supplies, risking “physical and emotional harm”. The charity said that over 130,000 homes inhabited by a disabled person or someone with a long-term health condition are being disconnected from their energy supply at least once a week as they cannot afford to top up. The numbers are estimates based on data from the energy regulator, Ofgem, and a representative poll of more than 4,000 adults in December commissioned by the charity. Using an average household size of 2.4 people, researchers estimated 3.2 million individuals across Great Britain live in households that ran out of credit at least once last year. Energy suppliers typically ask customers to move on to a pay-as-you-go prepayment meter if they fall significantly behind on their monthly bills. Where the change cannot be made remotely via smart meter, suppliers or the debt collection agencies acting for them obtain court warrants to enter homes. Data obtained from the Ministry of Justice through a freedom of information request has revealed hundreds of warrants of entry are being signed off in minutes in huge batches at magistrates courts around the country. Citizens Advice said its data showed suppliers were “forcibly installing meters where it isn’t appropriate”. The charity wants a review of all users of prepayment meters with a commitment to replace them with standard credit meters, where customers use the energy first and pay later, to remove the risk of disconnection. MPs have also called for a ban on forced installations. The Scottish National party MP Anne McLaughlin sponsored a private member’s bill that requires companies to allow a grace period before disconnecting customers with prepayment meters who have run out of credit, granting them extended emergency credit for six months. She labelled energy suppliers “morally repugnant”. Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, told the Guardian: “It is evident there is an escalation of people being forced on to prepayment meters where they’re paying more for their energy. If they’re unable to pay, they’re simply self-rationing. “I’m calling on government to get a grip on the situation to enable people to remain on energy contracts with support, and prepay meters need serious redress, if not being ruled out completely, as an option for people in fuel poverty.” Maskell said she had raised the issue with justice minister Mike Freer. Over the Christmas period, Ovo – one of the largest UK energy suppliers – paused the forced installation of prepayment meters. Supporters of the use of prepayment meters note that they allow households to keep a close track of their spending and can prevent much larger debts mounting up. The Citizens Advice study showed that 37% of prepayment customers with a disability or health condition had cut back on food spending to keep the lights on, while 14% used a food bank to maintain supplies. A Government spokesperson said: “The Government expects energy suppliers to do all they can to help customers who are struggling to pay their bills and suppliers can only install prepayment meters without consent to recover debt as a last resort. “The regulator Ofgem requires energy suppliers to offer solutions for customers in, or at risk of, debt or disconnection. This includes offering emergency credit to all pre-payment meter customers and additional support credit to customers in vulnerable circumstances.” If you’ve been affected by the issues in this article, you can get in touch with us here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/17/new-zealand-mp-says-rocket-lab-launches-could-betray-countrys-anti-nuclear-stance","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-17T04:10:49Z","webTitle":"New Zealand MP says Rocket Lab launches could betray country’s anti-nuclear stance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/17/new-zealand-mp-says-rocket-lab-launches-could-betray-countrys-anti-nuclear-stance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/17/new-zealand-mp-says-rocket-lab-launches-could-betray-countrys-anti-nuclear-stance","fields":{"bodyText":"A New Zealand commercial space company, Rocket Lab, has faced new opposition to its activities on behalf of foreign militaries, with one New Zealand Green MP saying its actions could fly in the face of the country’s anti-nuclear stance. The American-New Zealand company, founded by Peter Beck in 2006, provides rockets to deliver payloads into orbit from its launch site on the Māhia Peninsula, in New Zealand’s north. A third of Rocket Lab’s activities have been on behalf of defence and national security agencies. These include launching US and Australian spy satellites, the controversial “Gunsmoke J” satellite, and most recently Nasa’s capstone spacecraft. The company’s contracts with the US have been flagged as concerning by the Māhia community, the Green party, and Rocket Lab Monitor – a watchdog group. In 2019, the New Zealand government banned launch activities that were not in the country’s national interest, or were a breach of both domestic and international laws. The minister for economic and regional development, Stuart Nash, who is also the MP for the area that covers the Māhia Peninsula, has the ability to veto space launches that are not considered to be in the national interest, including payloads that contribute to nuclear weapons programmes or support or enable specific defence, security or intelligence operations contrary to government policy. But the Green party’s security and intelligence spokesperson, Teanau Tuiono warned last week that it is “unclear when the national interest test should be invoked” and that there is no guarantee the satellites will not be used to assist nuclear programmes. “Weaponising space is not in our national interest and goes against our international commitments to ensuring peace in space,” he said. “Launching space satellites from Aotearoa could improve the ability of foreign actors to control a nuclear explosive device,” Tuiono said. “But right now, the government is allowing operators like Rocket Lab to put payloads into space for the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command and the US Space Force.” Tuiono said that this poses a risk to New Zealand’s nuclear-free stance, which was enshrined in law more than 35 years ago and is considered a defining moment in the country’s history. “We risk betraying the anti-nuclear generation and handing our kids a less safe world,” Tuiono said. Rocket Lab has said its launches do not facilitate the command and control of nuclear weapons and, in a statement to the Guardian, said New Zealand has one of the most stringent regulatory systems for space activity in the world. “The Government has been clear that it will not allow a launch from New Zealand if the satellite contributes to nuclear weapons programmes or capabilities”, the statement said. “Rocket Lab supports this clear and robust policy.” “Launching satellites for defence forces does not automatically equate to launching weapons,” they said, adding that New Zealand relies on satellite technology operated by international militaries, including for communications for disaster relief and monitoring the exclusive economic zone. Satellite customers are required to disclose what their mission is to the government, and include the purpose, capabilities and objectives of putting the satellite into space, Rocket Lab said. Watchdog group, Rocket Lab Monitor, has said it’s skeptical that this is a fail-proof system and worries the country’s space agency lacks in-house expertise to assess if satellites are contributing to nuclear weapon programmes. “It all relies on the ‘intent’ of a payload rather than monitoring what it actually ends up being used for,” its spokesperson Sonya Smith said. Smith pointed to Rocket Lab’s 2021 launch of the “Gunsmoke-J” satellite – an experimental satellite that, according to the US army, can “provide tactically actionable targeting data” to “warfighters”, and to which Minister Nash admitted he was “unaware of [its] specific military capabilities”. Last month, the government announced a new aerospace strategy, that includes further financial support for the emerging sector. At the same time, it opened a review to allow the public to give feedback on the future of New Zealand’s space policy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/25/trevor-st-baker-excused-from-making-disclosures-in-court-case-alleging-corporate-misconduct-at-erm-power","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-25T15:00:37Z","webTitle":"Court allows Trevor St Baker to invoke right against self-incrimination in case alleging corporate misconduct against ERM Power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/25/trevor-st-baker-excused-from-making-disclosures-in-court-case-alleging-corporate-misconduct-at-erm-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/25/trevor-st-baker-excused-from-making-disclosures-in-court-case-alleging-corporate-misconduct-at-erm-power","fields":{"bodyText":"The Queensland energy baron Trevor St Baker has invoked his right against self-incrimination in a court case brought by a former executive at ERM Power, who alleges he uncovered “sham transactions” and insider trading. A Queensland supreme court ruling last week found that St Baker and his son, Philip, along with nine other former directors of ERM Power, should be excused from making certain disclosures in the case because doing so would expose them to “a real and appreciable risk of criminal prosecution”. St Baker, a prominent energy investor and a major donor to the Liberal National party, founded his former flagship ERM Power in the 1980s and was the company’s largest shareholder when it was acquired by Shell for $617m in 2019. The next year a former executive at ERM, Kent Quinlan, filed a civil case in the Queensland supreme court, claiming he made whistleblower disclosures about corporate misconduct at the publicly listed company in 2012. Quinlan is suing ERM Power, an associated company and 11 former directors for breach of contract, breach of statutory duty and breach of confidence. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The supreme court decision says Quinlan alleges he investigated two apparent “sham” transactions in 2012 that artificially inflated ERM’s profits. Court documents allege these transactions, including one with the Queensland government power company Stanwell Corporation, “were calculated to artificially enhance ERM’s market value in a way which misled and deceived investors”. It is alleged that Quinlan held a reasonable belief that the transactions were artificial or fictitious, liable to mislead the market and ERM’s shareholders, and were in contravention of the law. Trevor St Baker stepped down as chairman of ERM in 2011, a year before the alleged sham transactions. He remained a director until 2017 and the major shareholder until 2019. He is not personally accused of corporate misconduct in the court filing. Philip St Baker was the managing director and chief executive of ERM from 2006 to 2014. Quinlan alleges Philip St Baker “engaged in insider trading in the purchase of shares by his family share trading account on two occasions”. The St Bakers have been approached for comment via their legal team. Quinlan alleges he was entitled to protections as a whistleblower but had been subject to 25 separate “vindictive stratagems” by ERM and various directors between 2012 and 2020. In a preliminary judgment handed down last week, Justice Sue Brown excused the defendants, including Trevor and Philip St Baker and nine other former directors of ERM, from making certain disclosures. Trevor and Philip St Baker, and the other nine directors, had asked the supreme court to be excused from disclosing certain information and documents in the case on the grounds that “there is a real and appreciable risk of self-incrimination or exposure to penalty if they are not relieved from compliance with the pleading rules”. “According to [Trevor and Philip St Baker] that risk is revealed by the serious allegations made … Mr Quinlan’s own statements, the significant media attention the proceeding has received, and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission’s statements in its enforcement priorities,” the judgment said. “[Trevor and Philip St Baker] also refer to Asic media releases from 2022 which refer to Asic’s interest in taking action in relation to insider trading and market manipulation. “I am satisfied that [Trevor and Philip St Baker] have a real and appreciable risk of criminal prosecution or commencement of civil penalty proceedings which is reasonably held given that Mr Quinlan expressed an intention to lodge a complaint with Asic … the media attention of the proceeding, and Asic’s stated priorities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/jan/03/european-gas-prices-warm-january-weather-uk-heating","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-03T14:04:00Z","webTitle":"Risk of UK winter power cuts fades amid fall in wholesale gas prices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/03/european-gas-prices-warm-january-weather-uk-heating","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jan/03/european-gas-prices-warm-january-weather-uk-heating","fields":{"bodyText":"The likelihood of power cuts in Britain this winter has diminished “significantly” after a sharp fall in the wholesale price of gas. A spell of mild weather in the UK and Europe sent prices tumbling in a respite from the highs that led to soaring energy bills. European prices for delivery in February fell by 4.3% to €73.7 a megawatt hour while UK prices fell by 3.8% to 179p a therm. Recent warmer weather has reduced demand for heating in the UK and the rest of Europe and conditions are expected to remain mild for the next two weeks. The situation has boosted optimism over gas supplies, which have been stretched since Russia reduced gas exports to Europe after its invasion of Ukraine. Last week, prices fell to their lowest levels since before the start of the war in February 2022. European nations had rushed to fill up gas storage facilities amid fears of shortages this winter. They have made good progress, creating optimism among traders and leading to prices easing. Traders also bet that a potential global recession would cut energy demand this year. National Grid warned in October there was an outside possibility of three-hour rolling power cuts if cold weather combined with shortages, caused, for example, by a reduction in the gas supply from Russia. In December, a sudden blast of cold weather combined with low wind speeds to put a strain on Britain’s power systems and led to record power prices. Imported electricity from France and increased output from gas-fired power plants helped plug the gap left by renewables, averting a potential shortage of energy. National Grid has not had to use several of the emergency measures it had put on standby to avert power cuts this winter. Tom Marzec-Manser, the head of gas analytics at energy consultancy ICIS, said: “The risk of another cold snap and gas supplies not meeting demand this winter is now very low. We have done it once as a pan-European group of nations and proved we can withstand one of the coldest Decembers. “We are now that much closer to the end of the winter. The risk of there not being enough gas around this winter has reduced significantly.” Investec oil and gas analyst Nathan Piper said: “I do not think that we are likely to see power cuts come to pass. The situation with gas storage has improved, and we’ve seen electricity imports from France and Norway recently, so the likelihood of those extreme scenarios have eased a bit. However, gas price prices still remain far higher than in the past.” Concerns remain over how Europe will replace Russian gas imports in the coming year, meaning prices are likely to remain high against historical averages. Prices peaked at about 550p a therm in August, far higher than the 50p a therm 10-year average. Over the Christmas period, the Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, indicated that Moscow was prepared to resume gas supplies to Europe through the Yamal-Europe pipeline, which runs across Poland and was shut off last year. If this week’s fall in gas prices gathers pace, it could significantly cut the cost of the UK government’s efforts to cut energy bills. The state is covering the gap between wholesale prices and the energy price cap for suppliers, in an effort to limit typical household bills to about £2,500. The government said in November that it expected its scheme to cut domestic bills to cost £25bn this financial year and a further £13bn in 2023-24. Businesses and other energy consumers, such as schools and charities, are awaiting an update from the government on plans for an extension of a similar non-domestic initiative beyond March. Data from National Grid’s electricity system operator on Tuesday showed that more than half of the power generated in Great Britain was from wind, with gas accounting for 21% and nuclear 17%. In the run-up to Christmas gas-fired power stations made up as much as 60% of the energy mix."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/01/singapore-backs-aukus-and-says-australia-could-play-bigger-role-in-regional-security","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-01T09:20:02Z","webTitle":"Singapore backs Aukus and says Australia could play ‘bigger role’ in regional security","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/01/singapore-backs-aukus-and-says-australia-could-play-bigger-role-in-regional-security","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/01/singapore-backs-aukus-and-says-australia-could-play-bigger-role-in-regional-security","fields":{"bodyText":"Singapore has strongly backed the Aukus defence pact, with ministers saying they trust Australia to play a bigger role in regional security and don’t want south-east Asia to become “an arena for proxy wars”. After talks with Australian counterparts in Canberra on Monday, Singaporean ministers reaffirmed Australia’s nuclear-powered submarines would be welcome to visit once in service. Singapore, in turn, received assurances from the Albanese government that Australia would remain a reliable supplier of gas. Aukus has received a mixed response from members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, with Indonesia and Malaysia the most vocal in expressing concerns that the deal could add to a regional arms race. But Singapore is relatively comfortable with Australia’s multi-decade plans to acquire a fleet of eight nuclear-powered submarines with help from the US and the UK. Singapore’s minister for foreign affairs, Vivian Balakrishnan, said he had “absolutely no reason to doubt Australia’s commitment” to fulfilling its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. “When we say that we believe Australia is a constructive partner, it’s absolutely sincere,” he said. “So even on Aukus … insofar as it contributes constructively to regional security we’re in support of it. We are comfortable with all the three partners within Aukus because with each of them we’ve had long-term relationships and that’s why I think we’re able to work together.” Balakrishnan said Singapore wanted to ensure free access to the contested South China Sea as a right under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea “and not by permission or grace of any power”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup He said if relations between the US and China returned to “an even keel … that would give all of us much relief and a sense of stability”. South-east Asia must not become “an arena for proxy wars”, Balakrishnan added. Monday’s meeting brought together Australia and Singapore’s foreign affairs, defence and trade ministers. It was held a week after the defence strategic review argued the Australian defence force must project military power further from its shores. Singapore’s defence minister, Ng Eng Hen, told reporters after the meeting that he believed Australia could “play a bigger role in our region”. He said Australia was “not just an Indo-Pacifc country, but an Asian country”. “We would welcome Australia’s ships and planes to our bases and ultimately when your submarines are ready we would welcome them to call on our ports.” The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said both countries’ interests were “very aligned” on the importance of the multilateral system and rules. Wong said while they may use a different form of words, both countries agreed on the need for guardrails to manage tensions between the US and China to lower the chance of miscalculation or escalation. The deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, said Australia and Singapore wanted to play their parts in creating “pathways for peace” at a time of “great strategic complexity and significant strategic threat”. Marles also said the Albanese government regarded Singapore’s energy security “as profoundly important in terms of Australia’s national interest”. “We made very clear to our Singaporean counterparts that Australia will continue to be a completely reliable partner in terms of the provision of energy into the Singaporean market and that includes the provision of gas,” Marles said. Last week the Chinese foreign ministry responded to the defence review by urging countries not to “hype up the so-called China threat narrative”. But the issue is not expected to disrupt further efforts to “stabilise” the diplomatic relationship between Australia and China, its biggest trading partner."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/feb/11/can-poker-machine-reform-save-dominic-perrottet-from-polls-suggesting-hell-lose-power-in-nsw","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-10T14:00:01Z","webTitle":"Can poker machine reform save Dominic Perrottet from polls suggesting he’ll lose power in NSW?

In particular, Yabsley has wondered what it says about how voters might respond. “I think it’s a roll of the dice, so to speak, because it does tread on the toes of those for whom gambling – and poker machines – specifically are a form of entertainment. But that being said, I think there is a more broad acceptance in the public now about gambling doing real harm to the community,” he said. As NSW prepares to head to the polls on 25 March, Perrottet’s commitment to cashless gaming has dominated headlines and the oxygen of the nascent campaign. It has put pressure on the opposition Labor party – which has only committed to trialing the technology – and helped the premier craft an image as a leader with the conviction to take on powerful vested interests such as the clubs lobby. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Politics,” he said, when asked this week why no other government in NSW had previously been willing to pursue gambling reform. While Perrottet’s convictions seem sincere, there is also a sense that, as the leader of a party trailing in the polls, dogged by integrity scandals, and asking for a rarely granted fourth term in government, it is also smart politics. As one Labor MP told the Guardian this week: “Perrottet all of a sudden looks like the big, brave integrity politician while we’re the same old shady Labor, yet he’s the one who … [knew about the New York appointment of John] Barilaro … who helped allow a second casino in Sydney. It’s spin. Good spin, but spin.” But will it change any votes? The Coalition is in tricky territory heading into the vote. While some recent polls show Perrottet remains preferred premier, the government has trailed Labor by as much as 56% to 44% on a two-party preferred basis. If such a vote was replicated on election day, Labor would win a majority. Election analysts, though, caution that Labor’s path to victory is not simple. In order to govern in a majority, it would need to win nine seats from the Coalition in the 93-seat chamber. It’s not an impossible task, but would require a uniform swing of about 6%. As election analyst Kevin Bonham told the Guardian: “On paper it’s just a lot of seats for Labor to get a majority. And they’re polling well enough to do it at the moment but not with a lot of room to move.” As always in state elections, western Sydney will be key. Coalition seats on margins of less than 1% include East Hills and Penrith, but Labor is also hopeful in Winston Hills, Riverstone, Parramatta and even Camden (5.4%, 6.2%, 6.2% and 7.4% respectively). “That’s interesting because at recent elections the Liberals have generally held up OK in outer suburbia and are getting crunched in inner suburbia,” Bonham says. “That may not be the case in this campaign because the pokies issue cuts across that. [Perrottet’s cashless gaming card] is appealing more to the socially conscious inner-city voter and maybe it arouses a bit of opposition in more working-class areas.” Ben Raue, an election analyst who runs the Tally Room, said while he thought Labor’s prospects were “quite good”, there was also a large possibility that the vote could end in a hung parliament and a “rickety” government of either persuasion. “There’s a few tranches of seats and if Labor can only pick up that first tranche of about four seats including say East Hills, Penrith, Upper Hunter [0.6%] and Goulburn [3.1%], it’s sort of maximum chaos because both sides are a fair way from a majority and have to haggle with what looks like it will be a very large crossbench,” he said. But with the Coalition already effectively governing in minority, the question is can it do enough to keep hold of those ultra-marginal seats even after 12 years in power. As Bonham says, history certainly isn’t on its side. “It’s rare for a state government to get a fourth term, and this government has almost no room to move,” he said. Kerry Chikarovski, who led the NSW Liberal party while in opposition between 1998 and 2002, said to buck that trend, the government would have to remind voters of its record. “What they will be saying to the community is, yes we may have been here a long time but we’ve been incredibly busy in that time. The massive infrastructure build in those 12 years, the roads, rail, light rail, the schools and hospitals,” she said. Chikarovki also believed Perrottet’s leadership on the pokies issue could prove to be a potent play for the government, and said comments by the now-former ClubsNSW boss Josh Landis about the premier’s faith had helped bring it to the fore. “That made a whole lot of people who might not have been taking much notice, pay attention,” she said. “People have thoughts on what sort of leader they want and if the premier is being criticised as a man of values, a lot of people would say, ‘hold on that’s something I support’.” While the government has been busy redefining itself, Labor under Chris Minns has played a much safer game: seeking to focus on cost-of-living issues with policies such as expanded stamp duty exemptions, and promises to boost funding for health and education. While Labor has been criticised for not offering a more inspiring platform, Raue said that may not matter. “I don’t think they’re really giving people much reason to vote for them but I’m also not sure they need to in a situation where maybe you have just enough to limp over the line,” he said. “You don’t need to give people a reason ultimately if the other side annoys enough people. Minns is presenting as competent and serious, he gives an air of being up to the job.” Chikarovki too thought he’d been impressive as Labor leader, saying his “cautious” strategy had played well during an era that included the pandemic. “Whether being a small target will get him over the line I’m not sure,” she said. Yabsley drew a parallel with the 1988 election which saw the Coalition sweep to power after 12 years of Labor rule. “There are two really clear-cut analogies: one is that we had a leader emerge who was capable of breaking the drought,” he said. “There was a conga line of Liberal leaders before Nick Greiner who had just failed to cut through and I think it’s possibly similar with Chris Minns. He has had a degree of traction [and] been fairly impressive, I think, as a performer.” The other, he said, was the length of time the Coalition has been in power. “It’s just awfully hard, when you’ve been in power that long – had the scandals and the baggage and all of that – to convince people that it isn’t time for a change.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/mar/27/peta-condemns-rings-of-power-producers-after-horse-dies-on-set-of-lord-of-the-rings-spin-off","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-27T03:08:32Z","webTitle":"Peta condemns Rings of Power producers after horse dies on set of Lord of the Rings spin-off","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/27/peta-condemns-rings-of-power-producers-after-horse-dies-on-set-of-lord-of-the-rings-spin-off","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/27/peta-condemns-rings-of-power-producers-after-horse-dies-on-set-of-lord-of-the-rings-spin-off","fields":{"bodyText":"The animal rights group Peta has condemned the use of live animals on set after a horse died during the production of Amazon’s television series The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. The horse had a cardiac arrest on 21 March, while the fantasy spin-off was rehearsing for its second season in the UK. “We are deeply saddened to confirm that a production horse died,” said a spokesperson for Amazon Studios on Sunday morning. “The incident took place in the morning whilst the horse was being exercised prior to rehearsals. “The trainer was not in costume, and filming had yet to commence. Both a veterinarian and a representative of the American Humane Association were present at the time. The independent necropsy has confirmed that the horse died of cardiac failure.” The horse was standing near 20 other horses when its heart stopped, sources told Deadline. More than 30 horses were reportedly on set that day. In a statement released shortly after the news broke, Peta said the show was “exploiting animals” and called for film and television productions to use CGI in place of real creatures. “It seems that living underground with the orcs is par for the course for the producers of The Rings of Power, because they have the option to use CGI, mechanical rigs and other humane methods,” said Peta’s senior vice-president Lisa Lange. “Peta is calling on the show’s creators – and all other producers – to take on a new quest without using any real horses.” All horses used in the second season of The Rings of Power were provided by the Devil’s Horsemen, a supplier of horses and stunt people in the film industry. The company has worked with big-name series including Game of Thrones and The Crown, as well as Hollywood productions such as Justice League and Transformers. The Lord of the Rings franchise has come under fire previously for its treatment of live horses. In 2012 the director Peter Jackson was criticised for the production of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Animal wranglers on set alleged that three horses, as well as other farm animals, had died during production. In a response at the time, Peta launched a petition urging filmgoers to “refuse to see movies” where animals have been harmed. Jackson later denied the claims that any animals had been mistreated, calling them “unsubstantiated”. “The production regrets that Peta has chosen to make such a serious allegation, which has distressed many of the dedicated Kiwis who worked with animals on the film,” Jackson wrote on Facebook. The Rings of Power is a prequel to The Lord of the Rings set in Middle-earth thousands of years before the events of the film series. Its first season, which was filmed in New Zealand, became a blockbuster success for Amazon. The studio claimed it was the “biggest premiere in the history of Prime Video”, drawing 25 million viewers in its first 24 hours."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/05/poland-us-nuclear-wars-russia-putin-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-05T21:46:49Z","webTitle":"Poland suggests hosting US nuclear weapons amid growing fears of Putin’s threats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/05/poland-us-nuclear-wars-russia-putin-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/05/poland-us-nuclear-wars-russia-putin-ukraine","fields":{"bodyText":"Poland says it has asked to have US nuclear weapons based on its territory, amid growing fears that Vladimir Putin could resort to using nuclear arms in Ukraine to stave off a rout of his invading army. The request from the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, is widely seen as symbolic, as moving nuclear warheads closer to Russia would make them more vulnerable and less militarily useful, according to experts. Furthermore, the White House has said it had not received such a request. “We’re not aware of this issue being raised and would refer you to the government of Poland,” a US official said. Duda’s announcement appears to be the latest example of nuclear signalling as the US and its allies seek to deter Putin from the first nuclear use in battle since 1945, while preparing potential responses if deterrence fails that would have maximum punitive impact while containing the risk of escalation to all-out nuclear war. Previous war games conducted by US administrations have shown that is a fine, and fuzzy, line to tread, given the uncertainty over Putin’s state of mind, and his record of giant miscalculations over Ukraine. Duda’s remarks on basing nuclear weapons followed changes in the constitution of neighbouring Belarus that would allow Russian nuclear weapons to be based on its territory. The Polish president said there was “a potential opportunity” for Poland to take part in “nuclear sharing”, by which pilots from the host country are trained to fly missions carrying US nuclear bombs, which are stored on their territory. “We have spoken with American leaders about whether the United States is considering such a possibility. The issue is open,” Duda told Gazeta Polska. Moving US nuclear weapons into Poland could be a violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the Nato-Russia Founding Act in 1997, after the end of the cold war in which Nato stated it had no plan to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of new members. Russia has meanwhile violated its own commitments under the act. Nuclear experts also added it made little strategic sense for Poland or Nato. The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) estimates the US has 100 nuclear weapons left over in Europe in the aftermath of the cold war, spread among the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Turkey. They are all B61 bombs which had been seen as militarily obsolete with no mission in the event of a war with Russia. Arms control experts have long called for them to be removed from Europe. However, they have been modernised as the B61-12, with fins that allow its fall to be guided, which is expected to enter service this year. The bombs have also been designed to be carried by new F-35A Lightning II stealth fighter jets, which would potentially make it part of the active US nuclear arsenal. Hans Kristensen, director of FAS’s nuclear information project, said the B61-12 storage sites in Europe are being upgraded and strengthened. “The reason they’re doing that is to protect that force against what they consider the growing threat from Russia’s conventional missiles, so it would be an extraordinarily strange development if Nato therefore decided to move nuclear weapons closer to the Russian borders,” Kristensen said. Poland has raised the issue at a time when the prospect of nuclear weapons use is higher than at any time since the cold war, and arguably since the Cuban missile crisis 60 years ago this month. Putin has threatened to use all means at his disposal to defend Russian territory at the same time as declaring the annexation of four more Ukrainian regions. He made the declaration as Russian troops were in retreat in the face of a Ukrainian counter-offensive. The White House has warned of “catastrophic consequences” if Putin did resort to using nuclear weapons, but did not specify what those would be. It has said it has warned Russian officials privately, but it is not clear how much more specific those warnings have been. Zbigniew Rau, the Polish foreign minister, said last week the consequences should be non-nuclear but “devastating”. David Petraeus, who was formerly the head of US Central Command and CIA director, said on Sunday that one possible response would be US-led Nato conventional strikes on Russian forces inside Ukraine and even the sinking of Russia’s Black Sea fleet. In reality, Nato is unlikely to be part of any response, as it would require agreement by its 30 members. More likely it would involve Washington and its closest allies like the UK. “There are ongoing discussions and have been for a while about various scenarios and how we might react,” an official in Washington said. US European Command is also doing scenario planning, the official said, adding that “there is no concrete set of actions” planned. The dilemma facing the military planners is how to act in such a way that Putin does not benefit militarily from using a nuclear weapon, but not so forcefully that escalation spins out of control and leads inexorably to nuclear war between Nato and Russia. Much would depend on what Putin did. The Russians could stage a “demonstration” nuclear detonation over the Black Sea, or a high-altitude airburst that generates an electromagnetic pulse that fries the electricity infrastructure of any city below. Those actions, however, would cause international outrage with little if any effect on the course of the war. The use of a nuclear weapon against Ukrainian military targets or a city, with the aim of shocking Kyiv into surrender or acceptance of partial Russian occupation would represent a far greater transgression. The range of responses in that case would include further sanctions, including secondary sanctions targeting anyone or any country buying Russian oil. Stepping up arms supplies to Kyiv, including longer-range missiles and jets the Ukrainians have been demanding, is another option. Actual Nato strikes against Russian military targets in Ukraine, would represent a huge leap, turning the conflict into a war between Russia and Nato, something policymakers have spent nearly 80 years trying to prevent. “The reaction to nuclear use would be just as important as the nuclear use itself,” Mariana Budjeryn, senior research associate at the project on managing the atom at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Centre. “If it does force Ukraine into some kind of settlement and the allies think we’re throwing in the towel on this, then it does show that, hey, nuclear arms really get you what you want,” Budjeryn said. “If nuclear weapons are used, and that only makes everyone a lot more upset and hardens the resolve and somehow stops Russia in its tracks, then it’s a different story.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/06/nova-kakhovka-dam-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ukraines-strategically-important-reservoir","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-06T05:05:10Z","webTitle":"Nova Kakhovka dam: everything you need to know about Ukraine’s strategically important reservoir ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/06/nova-kakhovka-dam-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ukraines-strategically-important-reservoir","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/06/nova-kakhovka-dam-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ukraines-strategically-important-reservoir","fields":{"bodyText":"In the early hours on Tuesday, footage began to emerge of water spilling from the strategically important Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine. The Ukraine army’s southern military command said the dam had been blown up by Russian forces. The local Russian-installed mayor has called it a “terrorist act”. Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River lies about 20 miles (30km) east of the city of Kherson. Its destruction will have a number of significant repercussions for the local area – and for Ukraine’s wider war effort. Why is Nova Kakhovka dam significant? The dam traverses Ukraine’s enormous Dnipro River, holding back a huge reservoir of water. The dam itself is 30 metres tall and hundreds of metres wide. It was built in 1956 as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. The reservoir it contains holds an estimated 18 cubic kilometres of water, about the same volume as the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Bursting the dam could send a wall of water flooding settlements below it, including Kherson, which Ukrainian forces recaptured in late 2022. Soon after Ukraine accused Russia of blowing up the dam, the head of the Kherson region urged residents to evacuate the area warning that “water will reach a critical level in 5 hours”. Water from the reservoir supplies the Crimean peninsula to the south, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, as well as the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, to the north. It also helps power the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant. Its destruction will add to Ukraine’s ongoing energy problems, after Russia spent weeks earlier this year targeting vital infrastructure. It will also be likely to wreck the canal system that irrigates much of southern Ukraine, including Crimea. Has it been threatened before? Since the start of Russia’s war against Ukraine, the Nova Kakhovka dam has been earmarked as a potential target for both its strategic importance – as well as the damage that its destruction would unleash. It was captured by Russia at the start of Moscow’s February 2022 invasion, and has been held by it ever since. In October, as Ukraine was in the midst of reclaiming large parts of occupied Kherson, Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the west to warn Russia not to blow up the dam, warning that it would flood a large area of southern Ukraine. At the time, he claimed that Russian forces had planted explosives inside the dam. Zelenskiy said “destroying the dam would mean a large-scale disaster” and compared such an act to the use of weapons of mass destruction. Ukraine military intelligence said “the scale of the ecological disaster [would] go far beyond the borders of Ukraine and affect the entire Black Sea region”. At the same time, Russia accused Kyiv of rocketing the dam and planning to destroy it. After Ukraine recaptured Kherson in November, images emerged of some significant damage to the dam. Russia had accused Ukraine of shelling the dam in its campaign to recapture Kherson. What has been happening this year? In May, residents in a nearby village reported ongoing flooding which they blamed on Russia’s occupation of Nova Kakhovka. Speaking to the Reuters news agency, locals said the water level had begun to rise in April, sometimes by up to 30cm a day, and had remained elevated since. Ukrainian officials said the rise of the Dnipro’s water level, “as a result of which settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were flooded, is linked to the Russian occupation of the Kakhovka dam”. But they added that they were unable to say what exactly Russian forces were doing at the dam because they did not have access themselves. A Russian energy official said in May that the dam risked being overwhelmed by record-high water levels.

Gantz also revealed a map detailing 10 facilities in Syria allegedly being used to arm Iran and its proxies, including Hezbollah. He said the facilities represented a threat to Israel’s security. Iran for its part claimed it had manufactured a stealth drone that could hit major Israeli cities. At the same time, the UN nuclear inspectorate chief, Rafael Grossi, said it would be extremely hard to restore the knowledge his organisation had lost about Iranian nuclear activities owing to his inspectors and cameras being barred from key sites by Iran. He was speaking at the opening of a board meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, at which he argued Iran was not cooperating with its inquiry into traces of nuclear particles found at three sites prior to 2013, a discovery that suggests Iran may at one point have run a covert nuclear programme. Iran has demanded that the IAEA inquiry be formally halted as part of any agreement to revive the nuclear deal that was signed in 2015 and from which the US withdrew in 2018. Talks on the agreement have ground to a halt. France, Germany and the UK issued a statement over the weekend saying they could offer no more concessions in the revival talks, adding: “Iran’s latest demand raises serious doubts as to Iran’s intentions and commitment to a successful outcome on the talks.” But the three are unlikely to table a fresh censure resolution this week, after the previous IAEA board meeting in June voted to condemn Iran’s lack of cooperation. Iran wants the inquiry formally dropped on the grounds that it is politically inspired by Israel to rake up old issues. But Grossi countered: “This is very straightforward. We found traces of uranium in places that were never declared, that were never supposed to have any nuclear activity, and we are asking questions. Explain to me why this is a political activity.” It is thought the US would prefer to keep a lid on the Iran issue before the midterm elections in November, but one of the most informed thinktanks on the nuclear deal, the International Crisis Group, said in a new report that the situation could spiral out of control. It said there was little space left for Iran to escalate without it being able to make weapons-grade fissile material in days. The US has been steadily increasing sanctions against Iran while Tehran has, according to the IAEA, increased its nuclear stockpile and use of advanced centrifuges. The Crisis Group suggested the two sides should, in an effort to buy time, discuss the possibility of single-measure commitments, such as a deal on the humanitarian release of dual-national detainees, while respecting each other’s red lines to avert nuclear and regional escalation. The Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, is due to travel to New York next week for the UN general assembly, if the US grants him a visa."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/nov/06/the-state-of-prisons-examined-from-inside-and-outside","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-06T18:20:07Z","webTitle":"I was in prison and saw how power can corrupt officers | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/nov/06/the-state-of-prisons-examined-from-inside-and-outside","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/nov/06/the-state-of-prisons-examined-from-inside-and-outside","fields":{"bodyText":"Re the article by Deborah Coles and Jessica Pandian (In Britain, a jail sentence is often a death sentence. What’s going on in our prisons?, 31 October), at the turn of the century I received a ridiculous five-year prison sentence for allegedly allowing heroin into a homeless project that I ran. Local police and some vociferous local residents didn’t like my ideas about expansion of provision. Luckily I am a middle-class woman who was supported by some good people and was released after seven months. I came out with a tumour, but I have survived, so far. Prisons create internal as well as external trauma; this was added to the abuse, neglect and trauma suffered throughout their lives by the vast majority of my fellow inmates, ordinary people who had not had the benefits and support that luckier people have. In fact, I found the nastiest people in the prison to be prison officers who seemed to delight in being able to dominate and abuse their charges. The decent officers I met didn’t survive in the job. They left pretty quickly before they became infected by the deeply ingrained culture, partly caused by the awful conditions within which many of them worked. “Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely,” remarked Lord Acton. Indeed. It’s about time the human race grew up and lived up to its much-used description: humane. Ruth Wyner Cambridge • We must not forget the elderly and those with chronic health conditions in prison. I am aware of a prisoner who was incarcerated at 87, despite the judge being aware that he had cancer and other long-term health problems. It appears that he did not receive the specialist care he needed. His condition deteriorated rapidly and after only three weeks he was admitted to hospital. He and his family spent their last hours together while he was kept under guard. He maintained his innocence throughout and, too late for him, an appeal is at last going to be heard. According to the health and social care committee’s report on prison health in 2018, the standardised mortality rate of prisoners is 50% higher than the general population. The report said: “A prison sentence, we heard strongly, is a deprivation of someone’s liberty: it is not a sentence to poorer health or poorer health and care services.” Tragically, four years later, imprisonment is all too often a death sentence. John Coffin Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex • Fundamentally our prison problems start with politicians in Whitehall taking over the administration of justice, including nationalising magistrates courts. These deal with 97% of all criminal court cases and most go no further. The magistrates courts used to be run by committees responsible to the local magistrates and local government. They were abolished by New Labour and replaced by Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service, which is now responsible to the justice department. The Conservative government made huge reductions in justice department budgets and closed half of the magistrates courts in Wales and England. Prisons are desperately underfunded. Add to that the awful record of the Home Office in dealing with prisons while politicians are forever calling for more miscreants to be banged up. In 20 years as a local magistrate I saw this excessive centralisation at first hand and concluded that while the old system was not perfect, with the dead hand of the Westminster civil service and politicians there will be no real improvement. If we wish to improve our justice system we need to decentralise the police and the courts so that there is local accountability; and there must be a recognition that the cheese-paring of justice in this country is counterproductive.

Some residents expressed anger at being alerted of water safety issues several hours after the outage while others complained about finding out through social media. Officials are testing whether the outage at the facility let bacteria contaminate the local drinking water supply, and results are not immediate. Harris county, the city’s largest county, issued an alert to residents on Sunday night: “A boil water notice has been issued for the City of Houston’s Main Water System (TX1010013). Earlier today, the water pressure dropped below the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s required minimum of 20 PSI [pounds per square inch] during a power outage at the East Water Purification Plant … at 10.30am.” It added: “When it is no longer necessary to boil the water, the public water system officials will notify customers that the water is safe for drinking water or human consumption purposes.” On Monday morning Texas’s environmental quality commission approved the city’s plan to sample water before removing the boil water notice. Houston’s mayor, Sylvester Turner, wrote on Twitter that the earliest the boil water notice could be lifted is on Monday night or in the early hours of Tuesday morning. School was cancelled for some students on Monday, like in the independent school districts of Houston and Aldine, as residents were advised to boil water for at least three minutes before drinking, bathing, brushing their teeth and preparing food. Other school districts in the city told students and parents that school was still in session but that bottled water would be provided. The University of Houston told its students and employees that they “are encouraged to make plans for food and water as menu options will be limited on campus”. It is not the first time the city issued such a warning. In February 2021 a winter storm that swept the state caused its electrical grid to fail, leaving water treatment plants without power and millions of people in the dark. Cities in the state have also issued boil water notices during hurricane season. After Hurricane Harvey devastated their city in 2017, Houstonians narrowly avoided a boil water notice. But other nearby south-east Texas communities suffered when their water systems shut down. Other US cities – including Flint, Michigan; Baltimore; and Jackson, Mississippi – have recently faced water safety issues that left residents without clean drinking water, calling into question the integrity of water system infrastructure in one of the wealthiest nations in the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/06/svengali-review-absorbing-gender-swap-power-play","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-06T14:30:16Z","webTitle":"Svengali review – absorbing gender-swap power play","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/06/svengali-review-absorbing-gender-swap-power-play","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/06/svengali-review-absorbing-gender-swap-power-play","fields":{"bodyText":"How do you represent male power on stage without replicating the very structures you want to challenge? The solution in Eve Nicol’s absorbing play is to cast a woman in the role of a domineering man. With slicked-back hair and cool summer suit, Chloe-Ann Tylor brings a disruptive distance to the character she plays. She is at once the manipulative patriarch, driven by some combination of testosterone and urge to control, and something else altogether. It is as if her every gesture comes with a question mark, making this powerful man’s urges seem not only damaging but strange. Tylor is very good. Rooted, physically precise and sonorous, she portrays the Svengali character who first appeared in Trilby, George Du Maurier’s 19th-century novel. He is now re-imagined by Nicol, who also directs, as an ambitious modern-day tennis coach. Appearing like a hardcore Henry Higgins, bending the world to his will, he picks up Trilby, a young woman with no apparent skills in the game, in order to break her down, re-programme her and build her up as a grand-slam champion. Compliant and hypnotised, Trilby battles her way from the US Open to Wimbledon with the ferocity of a machine. Her coach, operating in an uncertain area between lust and sadism, feeds on her success even though that very success – witness Eliza Doolittle – is what will inevitably pull her away from him. At a time when questions of coercion, exploitation and abuse are being asked in sport, as they have been in fashion and entertainment, Nicol’s play attempts to get under the skin of a man bewitched by his own power. It feels grimly appropriate that Trilby has as little say in the play as she does in her career. At Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 28 August.

It is now packed with men – there has never been a woman on the PSC – who are loyal Xi acolytes, in what one analyst described as “maximum Xi”. They range from a friend with ties to the Xi family going back decades to more recent aides who proved their commitment as he consolidated power over the years, and the hardline ideologue who is his chief political theorist. After Mao’s death, the Chinese Communist party (CCP) tried to normalise a collective leadership that made the general secretary of the party a kind of “first among equals” on the PSC. That era is over. However, the PSC members still wield immense power and will be key in shaping and implementing Xi’s vision for China and the CCP. Below are brief introductions to these seven men. New entrants to the politburo have a star (*) by their name Politburo standing committee Xi Jinping, 69 Xi took charge of the Communist party, and so of China, in late 2012. He has used this week to cement his power, and remove all political rivals from the politburo standing committee. He has been given another five years in power, and is likely to stay on beyond that. He his positions as general secretary of the Chinese Communist party and chair of the central military commission were renewed at the party congress. His position as president of the People’s Republic of China will almost certainly be renewed at the rubberstamp parliament, the National People’s Congress, next March. * Li Qiang, 63 Li Qiang, a close Xi ally, is party secretary of Shanghai, which has historically been a training ground for top national leaders. He is expected to be the next premier when Li Keqiang – now out of the standing committee and headed for retirement – steps down from the premiership in March. Li presided over the disastrous Shanghai Covid lockdown at the start of this year, doubling down on the “zero Covid” approach favoured by Xi despite a heavy economic and human cost. His elevation has widely been taken as a sign that Xi values loyalty, and familiar faces, over competence. From 2004 to 2007, when Xi was Zhejiang province’s top party boss, Li was his chief of staff. After Xi became China’s top leader, he promoted Li first to governor of Zhejiang and then party secretary of Jiangsu province, providing him with the regional governing experience and credentials he needed for bigger roles. Zhao Leji, 65 Zhao Leji has his roots in two impoverished western provinces – Shaanxi, his ancestral home, and Qinghai, where in 2000 he became the youngest provincial governor in the country. He has been head of the party’s top anti-corruption watchdog, the central commission for discipline inspection, a key instrument in Xi’s strengthening CCP and personal control. He also headed the party’s powerful Organisation Department, overseeing the appointment of all senior officials across China. He used that post to show his loyalty, placing Xi’s allies into important positions across the country during the past decade. Wang Huning, 67 A key Xi ally, Wang is rare among senior communist cadres in having no administrative experience running a province or major city. Instead he is Xi’s political theorist, his closest adviser on ideology, propaganda and foreign policy. A former academic known for his theories on “neo-authoritarianism”, Wang advocated a strong, centralised state to counter foreign influence. Helpfully for Xi, he also believes in strong central leadership, rejecting the collective leadership introduced after Mao Zedong’s death in an effort to avoid repeating the excesses of that era. His official positions include serving as director of the central policy research office (CPRO) from 2002 to 2020. * Cai Qi, 66 Cai Qi, Beijing party secretary, was the surprise entry to the PSC. He featured on some long-lists of potential candidates, but had not been widely tipped for the top. His entry is another sign of how Xi values both loyalists and people he knew rising up through the ranks. Born in Fujian, the eastern coastal province that would shape Xi’s early career, Cai spent the start of his working life there. He moved on to nearby Zhejiang province, where Xi served as governor, before being put in charge of Beijing in 2017. He has been a prominent champion of the Zero Covid policy embraced by Xi, and successfully oversaw the 2022 winter Olympics. * Ding Xuexiang, 60 Ding Xuexiang is an old and trusted ally of China’s leader. He served as Xi’s political secretary when he was Shanghai party chief in 2007 and rose with him to become private secretary and gatekeeper when Xi took over the country. He studied mechanical engineering and began his career as a researcher at the Shanghai Research Institute of Materials, before moving into party roles full time. Ding’s behind-the-scenes roles mean he has an even lower public profile than China’s other leaders, even though the CCP is generally secretive about senior figures. He is the youngest member of the standing committee and at 60, the only one who would be eligible under the old rules to serve another term in 2027. However, Xi has already ripped up norms on retirement age, so others could potentially stay on too. * Li Xi, 66 Li Xi is a long-standing member of Xi’s inner circle. The two men have known each other, and reportedly been family friends, since the early 1980s when Li worked for a party veteran who was close to Xi’s father. He has risen steadily in the party through positions across China, in Shaanxi, Shanghai and Liaoning provinces. He originally studied Chinese language and literature, but more recently did an MBA at Tsinghua University. He is now party chief of affluent Guangdong province. There he is responsible for the development of the Greater Bay Area, Xi’s masterplan for an economic powerhouse that integrates nine Chinese cities with Hong Kong and Macau."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/jun/03/ai-danger-doomsday-chatgpt-robots-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-03T11:00:29Z","webTitle":"Robot takeover?

Just this week, more than 300 industry leaders published a letter warning AI could lead to human extinction and should be considered with the seriousness of “pandemics and nuclear war”. Terms like “AI doomsday” conjure up sci-fi imagery of a robot takeover, but what does such a scenario actually look like? The reality, experts say, could be more drawn out and less cinematic – not a nuclear bomb but a creeping deterioration of the foundational areas of society. “I don’t think the worry is of AI turning evil or AI having some kind of malevolent desire,” said Jessica Newman, director of University of California Berkeley’s Artificial Intelligence Security Initiative. “The danger is from something much more simple, which is that people may program AI to do harmful things, or we end up causing harm by integrating inherently inaccurate AI systems into more and more domains of society.” That’s not to say we shouldn’t be worried. Even if humanity-annihilating scenarios are unlikely, powerful AI has the capacity to destabilize civilizations in the form of escalating misinformation, manipulation of human users, and a huge transformation of the labor market as AI takes over jobs. Artificial intelligence technologies have been around for decades, but the speed with which language learning models like ChatGPT have entered the mainstream has intensified longstanding concerns. Meanwhile, tech companies have entered a kind of arms race, rushing to implement artificial intelligence into their products to compete with one another, creating a perfect storm, said Newman. “I am extremely worried about the path we are on,” she said. “We’re at an especially dangerous time for AI because the systems are at a place where they appear to be impressive, but are still shockingly inaccurate and have inherent vulnerabilities.” Experts interviewed by the Guardian say these are the areas they’re most concerned about. Disinformation speeds the erosion of truth In many ways, the so-called AI revolution has been under way for some time. Machine learning underpins the algorithms that shape our social media newsfeeds – technology that has been blamed for perpetuating gender bias, stoking division and fomenting political unrest. Experts warn that those unresolved issues will only intensify as artificial intelligence models take off. Worst-case scenarios could include an eroding of our shared understanding of truth and valid information, leading to more uprisings based on falsehoods – as played out in the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. Experts warn further turmoil and even wars could be sparked by the rise in mis- and disinformation. “It could be argued that the social media breakdown is our first encounter with really dumb AI – because the recommender systems are really just simple machine learning models,” said Peter Wang, CEO and co-founder of the data science platform Anaconda. “And we really utterly failed that encounter.” Wang added that those mistakes could be self-perpetuating, as language learning models are trained on misinformation that creates flawed data sets for future models. This could lead to a “model cannibalism” effect, where future models amplify and are forever biased by the output of past models. Misinformation – simple inaccuracies – and disinformation – false information maliciously spread with the intent to mislead – have both been amplified by artificial intelligence, experts say. Large language models like ChatGPT are prone to a phenomenon called “hallucinations”, in which fabricated or false information is repeated. A study from the journalism credibility watchdog NewsGuard identified dozens of “news” sites online written entirely by AI, many of which contained such inaccuracies. Such systems could be weaponized by bad actors to purposely spread misinformation at a large scale, said Gordon Crovitz and Steven Brill, co-CEOs of NewsGuard. This is particularly concerning in high-stakes news events, as we have already seen with intentional manipulation of information in the Russia-Ukraine war. “You have malign actors who can generate false narratives and then use the system as a force multiplier to disseminate that at scale,” Crovitz said. “There are people who say the dangers of AI are being overstated, but in the world of news information it is having a staggering impact.” Recent examples have ranged from the more benign, like the viral AI-generated image of the Pope wearing a “swagged-out jacket”, to fakes with potentially more dire consequences, like an AI-generated video of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announcing a surrender in April 2022. “Misinformation is the individual [AI] harm that has the most potential and highest risk in terms of larger-scale potential harms,” said Rebecca Finlay, of the Partnership on AI. “The question emerging is: how do we create an ecosystem where we are able to understand what is true? How do we authenticate what we see online?” ‘Like a friend, not a tool’: malicious use and manipulation of users While most experts say misinformation has been the most immediate and widespread concern, there is debate over the extent to which the technology could negatively influence its users’ thoughts or behavior. Those concerns are already playing out in tragic ways, after a man in Belgium died by suicide after a chatbot allegedly encouraged him to kill himself. Other alarming incidents have been reported – including a chatbot telling one user to leave his partner, and another reportedly telling users with eating disorders to lose weight. Chatbots are, by design, likely to engender more trust because they speak to their users in a conversational manner, said Newman. “Large language models are particularly capable of persuading or manipulating people to slightly change their beliefs or behaviors,” she said. “We need to look at the cognitive impact that has on a world that’s already so polarized and isolated, where loneliness and mental health are massive issues.” The fear, then, is not that AI chatbots will gain sentience and overtake their users, but that their programmed language can manipulate people into causing harms they may not have otherwise. This is particularly concerning with language systems that work on an advertising profit model, said Newman, as they seek to manipulate user behavior and keep them using the platform as long as possible. “There are a lot of cases where a user caused harm not because they wanted to, but because it was an unintentional consequence of the system failing to follow safety protocols,” she said. Newman added that the human-like nature of chatbots makes users particularly susceptible to manipulation. “If you’re talking to something that’s using first-person pronouns, and talking about its own feeling and background, even though it is not real, it still is more likely to elicit a kind of human response that makes people more susceptible to wanting to believe it,” she said. “It makes people want to trust it and treat it more like a friend than a tool.” The impending labor crisis: ‘There’s no framework for how to survive’ A longstanding concern is that digital automation will take huge numbers of human jobs. Research varies, with some studies concluding AI could replace the equivalent of 85m jobs worldwide by 2025 and more than 300m in the long term. The industries affected by AI are wide-ranging, from screenwriters to data scientists. AI was able to pass the bar exam with similar scores to actual lawyers and answer health questions better than actual doctors. Experts are sounding the alarm about mass job loss and accompanying political instability that could take place with the unabated rise of artificial intelligence. Wang warns that mass layoffs lie in the very near future, with a “number of jobs at risk” and little plan for how to handle the fallout. “There’s no framework in America about how to survive when you don’t have a job,” he said. “This will lead to a lot of disruption and a lot of political unrest. For me, that is the most concrete and realistic unintended consequence that emerges from this.” What next? Despite growing concerns about the negative impact of technology and social media, very little has been done in the US to regulate it. Experts fear that artificial intelligence will be no different. “One of the reasons many of us do have concerns about the rollout of AI is because over the last 40 years as a society we’ve basically given up on actually regulating technology,” Wang said. Still, positive efforts have been made by legislators in recent months, with Congress calling the Open AI CEO, Sam Altman, to testify about safeguards that should be implemented. Finlay said she was “heartened” by such moves but said more needed to be done to create shared protocols on AI technology and its release. “Just as hard as it is to predict doomsday scenarios, it is hard to predict the capacity for legislative and regulatory responses,” she said. “We need real scrutiny for this level of technology.” Although the harms of AI are top of mind for most people in the artificial intelligence industry, not all experts in the space are “doomsdayers”. Many are excited about potential applications for the technology. “I actually think that this generation of AI technology we’ve just stumbled into could really unlock a great deal of potential for humanity to thrive at a much better scale than we’ve seen over the last 100 years or 200 years,” Wang said. “I’m actually very, very optimistic about its positive impact. But at the same time I’m looking to what social media did to society and culture, and I’m extremely cognizant of the fact that there are a lot of potential downsides.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/audio/2023/jan/09/the-godfather-saudi-style-inside-the-palace-coup-that-brought-mbs-to-power-podcast","type":"audio","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-09T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"‘The Godfather, Saudi-style’: inside the palace coup that brought MBS to power – podcast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jan/09/the-godfather-saudi-style-inside-the-palace-coup-that-brought-mbs-to-power-podcast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/audio/2023/jan/09/the-godfather-saudi-style-inside-the-palace-coup-that-brought-mbs-to-power-podcast","fields":{"bodyText":"Read the text version here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/jan/19/you-have-to-set-time-aside-for-friendship-the-radical-power-of-hanging-out","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-19T11:50:11Z","webTitle":"‘You have to set time aside for friendship’: the radical power of hanging out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/19/you-have-to-set-time-aside-for-friendship-the-radical-power-of-hanging-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/19/you-have-to-set-time-aside-for-friendship-the-radical-power-of-hanging-out","fields":{"bodyText":"Some of my fondest memories of friends should, by rights, be entirely forgettable. There was that time we took our books to the park and dozed. The time we sat by the sea drinking coffee, watching the waves. The time we assembled my flatpack furniture (well – I watched), ordered a pizza and watched TV. Fifteen years ago, these open-ended hangs were effortless and my social life flowed with only the lightest steer. Fast-forward to now, and – whether it’s the difference between being in my 30s versus my 20s, or 2023 versus 2013, or a pile-up of both – often the best I can manage is a quick drink after work in three weeks’ time. No one, myself included, is ever free to just hang out. “I’d love to,” I say, sincerely – but there is always a “but”. The author and academic Sheila Liming wants us to find the time – or, more precisely, to reclaim it. Her new book, Hanging Out: The Radical Power of Killing Time, is partly a paean to the pleasures of idling with others and partly a manifesto to “take back our social lives from the deadening whirl of contemporary life”. “When we’re young, it feels like social interactions just create themselves: they happen organically, we run into each other,” says Liming, at home in Vermont, when we speak over Zoom. “As we get older, they seem like something we have to put more effort into. Meetings become more structured, at times more formal – and also more of a chore.” There is a desire, she says, “for more casual interactions that don’t have a lot of ‘objectives’ associated with them, where there is nothing in particular you’re trying to get out of it”. Liming proposes a return to hanging out – “more amorphous and looser” than parties, but in a world obsessed with outputs, perhaps of greater importance. Liming defines hanging out as: “any time that you find yourself killing time in the presence of others … It can be something really informal, like sitting on your friend’s sofa and having a cup of tea.” Rather than a particular activity, Liming says, it is an approach to socialising. For her, the gold standard was modelled by a colleague who invited Liming and her partner over for lunch. When they called to say that they were 20 minutes away, their host responded with enthusiasm, saying he would get started with the food. Then he asked: who was calling, sorry? Liming’s friend was willing to make lunch for anyone with his phone number. This was several years ago, she adds. “A lot has changed.” These days it may feel like we don’t have time for lunch at all, let alone to prepare it for friends who drop by. For office workers, technology and the associated expectation of round-the-clock availability have led to lengthening working days. Rising living costs have added to the pressure, with a reported 5.2 million UK workers taking on second jobs to cope. Leisure time, shrinking since the 1970s, is increasingly precious for women in particular, with US and UK statistics showing a stark gender gap: a reflection of uneven distribution of caring and domestic responsibilities. What free time people do have, time-use surveys consistently show, is mostly spent watching television – perhaps because we find ourselves too exhausted to do anything else. The barriers to hanging out go beyond simply finding the time and the energy: increasingly, they are structural. So-called “third places” – those in which you can comfortably spend time outside your home or office – are disappearing due to factors such as public spending cuts, privatisation and gentrification. In big cities it can be a struggle to find places to just be together. This creates a vicious cycle of needing money to spend time with friends, and needing to work to make money. This comes at a cost, Liming argues. When busy schedules mean plans are made long into the future, they can’t help but be crushed under the weight of expectation. By the time it actually happens, “I’ve almost talked myself out of the opportunity to enjoy it,” she says. The quality of our company is just as important as the fact of it, Liming says. “We’ve all had those experiences when we’re around someone who doesn’t quite have the time to interact with us socially. That feeling of being squeezed in between two things – of being an obligation.” I’m flooded with uncomfortable memories of events where I’ve had one foot out the door – mentally, physically or both – because I have tried to cram too much in: “stopping by” at two parties, or accepting a dinner invitation even though I’m on deadline. Seeing my grimace, Liming laughs. “It’s OK, it’s not personal. We all do it.” It is the upshot, she says, of a culture that is continuously pushing us to wring out every bit of value from our days and to “optimise” our lives. Those pressures have filtered down to our friendships. The pandemic hasn’t helped. “It’s like those muscles that I had previously strengthened through social interactions were flabby,” Liming says. Indeed, many people report that their circles have shrunk since Covid-19 – a YouGov survey last year found that 40% of Britons aged 16 and over had lost contact with some of their friends. Meanwhile, the number of “kinless” adults – those who find themselves without immediate family members in later life – is expected to grow. Yet amid this reported epidemic of loneliness, there is increased understanding that relationships are essential to our mental and physical wellbeing. Social isolation and loneliness can lead to an elevated risk of heart disease, stroke and premature death, according to a 2020 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine in the US. Liming proposes hanging out as a balm that forges connection and meaning. The first step is is to seek to nourish our relationships – not simply to renew them as we might a TV licence. “You have to set that time aside and make sure you’re doing it justice when you get the opportunity,” she says. That may mean politely declining those invitations you would only be attending out of obligation, so as to free yourself up for the ones that matter. Liming shudders to recall how many colleagues’ and distant school friends’ baby showers she got “roped into” attending in her early 30s. Relationships that we wish to maintain need not only time but space for intimacy, growth and even potential conflict. Liming writes of a disagreement she had recently with an old friend. After three hours, they had found common ground and Liming felt as if their “relationship had grown tougher somehow”. Had either of them been less invested, it might have been tempting to simply let the relationship cool. That is the muscle built by hanging out, says Liming, extending our tolerance for discomfort and our capacity for compassion. It is also about letting go of expectation. Hanging out doesn’t always have to mean “a perfect party scenario or gathering; it can be just OK”. Liming gives the example of her best friend from childhood, who now lives on the opposite coast and has two young children. When they meet Liming goes along with her friend on errands or to appointments. “Just seeing her in her daily life is much more interesting to me than a sort of forced environment,” she says. This is how I too stay connected with faraway friends, who I see on average once every two years. Where I used to try to catch up on everybody’s lives over an evening, as though I was cramming for an exam, my preference now is to dip into a few of them. I have tagged along to my sister’s work drinks, attended friends’ family gatherings, kept them company on their commute. It allows me to picture their days and engage more fully when we are apart. When schedules do not allow for sprawling socialising, or even face-to-face,“hanging out on the internet is just what we have to do”, says Liming. Certainly, in my experience, some digital interactions can be more rewarding than others – a few of my group chats on WhatsApp are nearly as free-flowing a source of entertainment and support as being together in person. This fits Liming’s thesis that hanging out is mostly a mindset, emphasising presence over merely being present. That can extend to interacting with those whom we often see but don’t count as friends: the staff at our favourite cafe or the familiar faces at the gym. A recent large-scale study found that having a diverse “social portfolio” was predictive of happiness and higher wellbeing. There are certainly risks to striking up conversations with strangers, or even allowing ourselves to be vulnerable with friends, Liming acknowledges. But: “What’s the worst thing that’s going to happen?” In the weeks after we speak, I experiment. I spend Saturday afternoon running errands with one nearby friend, then Sunday morning on Zoom with an old faraway one. I make a point of spacing out my work calls to allow for chat. I leave for yoga 10 minutes early and say hello to the instructor before class. I don’t create any more hours in my day, but I feel the difference. My new schedule allows space for possibility: to run into a friend and not have to rush off, or to receive a last-minute invitation and reply: “I’d love to” – no buts.

A Democratic state senator was proposing a law that could cut into Florida Power &amp; Light’s (FPL) profits. Landlords would be able to sell cheap rooftop solar power directly to their tenants – bypassing FPL and its monopoly on electricity. “I want you to make his life a living hell … seriously,” FPL’s CEO Eric Silagy wrote in a 2019 email to two of his vice-presidents about state Senator José Javier Rodríguez, who proposed the legislation. Within minutes, one of them forwarded the directive to the CEO of Matrix, LLC, a powerful but little-known political consulting firm that has operated behind the scenes in at least eight states. Rodríguez was ousted from office in the next election. Matrix employees spent heavily on political advertisements for a candidate with the same last name as Rodríguez, who split the vote. That candidate later admitted he was bribed to run. Hundreds of pages of internal documents – which are only coming to light now because Matrix’s founders are locked in an epic feud – detail the firm’s secret work to help power companies like FPL protect their profits and fight the transition to cleaner forms of energy. The Matrix saga illustrates the political obstacles policymakers and experts face as they attempt to cut climate pollution from the power sector, one of the biggest greenhouse gas contributors in the US. The ongoing clash between Matrix’s founder Joe Perkins, 72, and former CEO Jeff Pitts, 51, is exposing the firm’s decades of extensive influence peddling on behalf of utility clients. The issue extends to several states. Records obtained by Floodlight and the Orlando Sentinel show that Matrix consulted for FPL, as well as another Florida company, Gulf Power, and Alabama Power. Matrix affiliated groups have also worked to advance power companies’ interests in Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, and in front of the Environmental Protection Agency, public records show. In Florida, Matrix’s work touched almost every level of politics, from influencing local mayoral and county commission elections to combating attempts to reshape the state constitution. In each of those cases, Matrix was working against politicians or policies fighting to curb the climate crisis by encouraging renewable power. Matrix employees had a Jacksonville journalist spied on after he wrote critically about FPL. And in 2020, Matrix even harnessed the power of the press for itself, when its employees acquired control of The Capitolist, a Tallahassee-based political news site which it used for favorable coverage, leaked records show. “I find this to be horrifying and undemocratic,” said Gianna Trocino Bonner, former chief legislative aide for Rodríguez, after reviewing some of the leaked documents. “It’s unfortunate that our process allows for something like this to exist without accountability.” Big power companies operate as monopolies with captive customers in much of the south-east US. They are supposed to be closely regulated, but their profits and unchecked political spending makes them some of the most powerful entities in a state. Howard Crystal, an attorney for the environmental group Center for Biological Diversity, said that US utilities are allowed monopoly power “because they are supposed to expand the public interest. “[But] now we have this incredible corruption and a reversal of that because they are using their advantage to hang on to power and undermine democracy,” he said. So far, there have been two criminal investigations into the campaign against Rodríguez and another Democratic state senate candidate, leading to charges against five people, though authorities have not accused Matrix or FPL of wrongdoing. Matrix’s principal, Perkins, says he discovered only after Pitts left the firm that he and other now-former employees had been conducting “shadow activities and operations” dating back to 2016. He is suing Pitts in Alabama for fraud and conspiracy. “For many years and without my knowledge or approval, Pitts abused his power and position to benefit himself and his cronies,” Perkins said in a statement. “Upon realizing the extent of Pitts’s shadow operations and abuses of power, we filed our lawsuit against Pitts and those few rogue employees.” Pitts, who left Matrix in December 2020 to start his own firm, Canopy Partners, did not respond to a request for comment by deadline. He is also suing Perkins, alleging defamation and extortion. A spokesperson for FPL said it stopped working with Canopy in late 2021. FPL’s CEO Silagy in a recent interview denied knowing about or participating in the scheme against Rodríguez but said that Matrix had done “good work” for his company. Records show FPL trusted Matrix operatives with millions, including giving $14m to a single Matrix-run nonprofit in 2018 alone. Silagy said the email in which he told his team to make Rodríguez’s life “a living hell” was “a poor choice of words”. Digging for dirt In Florida, FPL and Matrix demonstrated how a utility and its consultants can work in tandem to resist clean energy reforms. FPL deployed lobbyists to the capital, while Matrix hired private investigators to dig for dirt and had operatives funnel dark money and order attack ads. Few examples are clearer than the case of South Miami. When the small south Florida city’s mayor helped pass an ordinance in 2017 mandating rooftop solar panels on new construction, a network of 10 FPL-aligned operatives mobilized to ensure his ouster. The team decided an effort to repeal the ordinance would probably fail. So they opted instead for “Mayor Stoddard’s electoral defeat and changing the makeup of the board”, according to a 2018 memo from Dan Newman, a Matrix contractor who was similarly involved in the campaign against Rodríguez. Along with a private investigator, the group delved into Stoddard’s past for episodes to weaponize against him, such as a South Miami commissioner’s claim on Facebook that Stoddard had forcibly kissed her. Documents show Matrix operatives arranged for the commissioner to record a robocall in which she called Stoddard “a creep”. Pitts at the time forwarded a draft of the script to two FPL executives. Newman in his memo also took credit for a Miami Herald story about the allegation. Meanwhile, Matrix-led non-profits funded a blizzard of ads against Stoddard, accusing him of using public money for “vendettas” and placing him alongside infamous sex offenders Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein. The plan ultimately failed, and Stoddard was re-elected. He has denied the allegations. “An organization that acts like a mafia should be treated like one,” Stoddard said. In a statement, Newman acknowledged managing the campaign against Stoddard and hiring a private investigator to look into the former mayor’s personal life. He said what he found was “deeply disturbing”. FPL did not respond to requests for comment by deadline. Matrix’s influence was felt on matters small and large, from Stoddard’s city of less than 12,000 to statewide fights over the Florida constitution. In 2019, when the electric utility industry was up in arms about a constitutional amendment to open up competition in Florida’s energy market, a Matrix-linked non-profit poured more than $10m into groups fighting it. Matrix also exerted political influence through the press, with its operatives acquiring control of a Tallahassee-based politics news site, The Capitolist. That gave Matrix consultants and FPL executives input on Capitolist stories. The site’s publisher, Brian Burgess, a former top spokesperson for past Florida governor Rick Scott, also suggested in emails that Matrix should lure prominent Florida journalists to a new site or buy local papers owned by media giant Gannett Company and then lay off most of the “clown reporters” to “inject content” into publications without anyone knowing who was “pulling the strings”. That proposal was forwarded to Silagy at FPL but never came to fruition. Burgess said he “never pitched nor solicited feedback from FPL executives on any story or business venture”, and FPL spokesperson Chris McGrath said acquiring a news organization would not have made sense as a business deal for FPL. *** Headquartered in Montgomery, Matrix has been described there as “the closest thing Alabama politics has to a non-governmental secret agency”. Perkins and Pitts worked together for more than 25 years, expanding the firm into a national operation with dozens of clients in myriad industries. But wherever the pair went, indictments often followed. An Alabama governor the company worked for was convicted of federal felony corruption charges. A Birmingham mayor who employed Matrix got 15 years for bribery, conspiracy and fraud. And a former regional administrator for the EPA who did business with Pitts pleaded guilty to violating state ethics law multiple times. From the beginning, Matrix showed no aversion to unsavory political tactics. In 1998, the firm distributed copies of a video in which a sex worker falsely alleged she had been sexually assaulted by a candidate for lieutenant governor. The sex worker later testified the allegations were untrue, and that she had been paid by a Birmingham businessman to make them. In 2015, Matrix distributed fliers for a suspicious charity in a predominantly Black neighborhood in North Birmingham. The fliers warned residents not to let the Environmental Protection Agency test their soil for the presence of contaminants left by a coal plant. The charity was a front established by a state representative. A local law firm and the company that owned the coal plant used the charity to pay the representative. Three people were federally convicted for their role in the ploy. Matrix was never accused of wrongdoing. One of Matrix’s oldest clients is Alabama Power, which employed Perkins’ personal consulting firm as early as 1999. In 2018, Perkins Communications received at least $1.49m from Alabama Power, a leaked contract shows. Those who provoked the utility’s ire suffered a harsh response. In 2013, Terry Dunn, a Republican electricity regulator at Alabama’s Public Service Commission made moves to hold formal hearings on how customers’ energy bills were calculated – something that hadn’t happened in three decades. Customers at the time were paying some of the highest rates for electricity in the south-east. Soon, Dunn faced attacks in the rightwing press and online, while Matrix-affiliated groups – some of which received millions from a non-profit run by a contractor for Alabama Power – filed a motion to intervene in the proceedings. Meanwhile, groups aligned with the utility falsely tied Dunn to the Obama administration’s efforts to reduce the use of coal. The tactics worked. Dunn lost his 2014 re-election campaign by a 19-point margin to Chip Beeker, a catfish farmer who is still in office. Months after he was elected, Beeker voted in favor of an energy price hike for consumers. Alabama Power still hasn’t had a rate case. “Southern Company and Alabama Power run the state of Alabama,” Dunn said. “They work off intimidating. You gotta bow down and kiss the ring.” A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on the firm’s activities. Perkins called Matrix’s work for the utility “confidential”. Ari Peskoe, director of the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard Law School said the “whole purpose” of firms like Matrix “is to conceal that it’s the utility doing this. The utility doesn’t want to be associated with this campaign.” Things start going ‘sideways’ Matrix grew so large that by 2015 it was operating several private aircraft to whisk Pitts and Perkins to client meetings. Flight data shows Matrix’s planes made more than 130 flights to five states in 2020 alone, frequently crisscrossing the south-eastern US but also traveling as far west as New Mexico. In Perkins’ telling, he was getting ready to hand over leadership of Matrix in December 2020 when Pitts surprised him by leaving the firm, taking three employees – as well as most of Matrix’s Florida-based clients – with him to launch Canopy. At the Birmingham office where Pitts and the others had worked, Perkins said he found a backup server that “appeared to have been beaten with something”. The firm later recovered more than a million files, according to Perkins, who said they reveal years of hidden, “shadow work” in Florida. Perkins and Pitts sued each other, with Pitts claiming his former mentor had “never followed through” on handing over the company despite years of discussions. Once he left, Pitts said Perkins smeared him to clients in an attempt to extort millions. As their feud escalated, internal documents started to arrive in reporters’ email inboxes from unknown sources. Many of the documents have since been verified by additional reporting, public records or Perkins himself. Silagy, the FPL CEO, says the pair initially told him they had come to an amicable agreement about parting ways. He says he told them that he was disappointed, but there was enough work for both of them, “based on the good work they had done”. “And then apparently, somewhere along the way, Jeff and Joe got sideways,” Silagy said.

A medieval story about the divine right of kings, it is performed by five actors, all in casual modern dress, on a stage stripped of any opulence. Anna Coombs’s adaptation is pared down to a drama about leadership with only 10 characters (as opposed to more than 30 in Shakespeare), its focus on patriarchal power and family betrayal. This makes it intimate, intense, and almost claustrophobic. The stage is strewn with spotlights and ladders – the latter a visual metaphor for Bolingbroke’s ascent to Richard’s throne and this set (designed by Colin Falconer) exposes both the stage workings and inner machinations of power. Produced by Tangle Theatre (which amplifies African and Caribbean voices) in association with MAST Mayflower Studios, it comes with a live score of Zimbabwean songs composed and directed by John Pfumojena. Actors double up as singers and the production’s musicality is central to its power, bringing great potent surges. Most strikingly, the female characters, already marginal in the original text, are absent. Also directed by Coombs, its study is patriarchy in its purest form: male bloodlines – fathers, sons, uncles and cousins – jostling aggressively for supremacy. All the more so with only one female actor in the cast – Lebogang Fisher, who plays Aumerle, who is a more central figure here. Actors double up and make each character distinct for the main part; the ensemble is strong, although some verse is spoken over-emphatically. Raheim Menzies plays Bolingbroke with an upstanding, military air and a Coventry accent, sharply distinct from the flowery RP spoken by Daniel Rock as Richard. Although he is the king’s first cousin, it is made plain that there is a social distinction between them and one which Bolingbroke uses to rally the masses against Richard’s irresponsible rule. Rock is best in his early scenes, displaying callow haughtiness and speaking the verse with crisp clarity. Sibusiso Mamba, playing various parts, is a strong presence along with Fisher. Percussive music heightens the tension and lighting (designed by Hansjörg Schmidt) defines the mood; the spotlights create an almost spooky effect, with some brightly lit, others whispering in shadows. It looses its tautness towards the end, but is well worth watching with a central concept that makes this play’s questions about leadership freshly relevant. Richard the Second is at Omnibus theatre, London, until 27 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/apr/25/asset-managers-investment-firms","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-25T09:00:33Z","webTitle":"They wield huge power over your day-to-day life, without consent or oversight.

Asset managers | Brett Christophers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/25/asset-managers-investment-firms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/25/asset-managers-investment-firms","fields":{"bodyText":"Asset managers are key figures in your life, although you may not be aware of it. These investment firms are mostly recognised for their ownership of financial assets such as stocks and bonds. But as well as owning financial assets, in recent decades they have been buying huge volumes of so-called “real assets”, which in many cases represent necessities of everyday life such as housing, schools, care homes, roads, energy systems, farmland and water-supply networks. Thus, the regular payments to asset owners that we make to stay alive and thrive – such as for shelter, electricity, water or food – increasingly end up in part or in full in the hands of asset managers. Those managers decide both how much we pay, and what condition the apartment, care home or pipes that supply our drinking water are in. Observers have noted isolated, individual examples of this phenomenon. However, the dots have not been joined. The common thread that weaves together such seemingly disparate examples as embattled Danish apartment tenants, beleaguered US care-home residents and indignant UK water rate-payers has been ownership – that is, asset-manager ownership. Today, such is the breadth and depth of this phenomenon that the lives of few people anywhere in the world are untouched by asset managers’ tentacles. And some of us, especially in the global north, are thoroughly entangled: we effectively live in an asset-manager society. Consider that just one asset manager, Australia’s Macquarie, owns infrastructure internationally on which more than 100 million people rely every single day. If their control of essential infrastructure gives asset managers direct power over the conditions and costs of our daily lives, they also enjoy a more indirect form of power. For a variety of reasons, including the growing amount of capital at their command (now in excess of $100tn), leading asset managers today possess formidable power to shape government policy, not least regarding the types of real assets that they themselves increasingly control. Whereas in the past governments leaned heavily on banks for advice on financial matters (but not only those), now it is principally asset managers that have their ear. Consider two striking examples from the US. Amid the detritus of the 2008–10 financial crisis, a key concern was housing finance. What was the Obama administration to do about the millions of mortgaged homeowners who were in negative equity and facing foreclosure? The treasury team that advised Obama hired multiple recruits from the asset manager Blackstone. The outcome? Policies that not only failed the foreclosed, but simultaneously enabled Blackstone itself to cheaply assemble a vast, profitable portfolio of rental homes, largely out of those properties that were foreclosed upon. Meanwhile, since Joe Biden became president, a more pressing concern has been climate finance. How should the US finance the infrastructure investment required for climate mitigation and adaptation? In this case the key policymaking entity has been the National Economic Council. Its director until February this year? The ex-head of “sustainable investing” at BlackRock. And the outcome? A policy based on government subsidisation of investment in clean-energy infrastructure by private-sector actors such as BlackRock itself. All this raises a crucial question. If asset managers really do possess such power over our daily lives via the infrastructure that we depend intimately upon, why have observers not been more aware of the fact? Bruce Flatt, the head of Brookfield Asset Management, one of the leading players in real-asset investment, has provided perhaps the best explanation. “What we do is behind the scenes,” he told the Financial Times. “Nobody knows we’re there.” It’s high time these firms, and their power, were brought into the light.

Though renewable energy could meet 100% of demand by 2025 at certain times of day at current rates of progress – a trend that could be turbocharged with active support from the federal government – the prospect of an Australian nuclear power station still looms large in the public conversation. Here is what we know about the pros and cons of nuclear power in an Australian context. Why was nuclear never adopted in Australia? Australian governments have always talked about building nuclear power plants but never actually followed through. While Australia holds 31% of the world’s supply of uranium, it has always been cheaper to rely on an ocean of cheap coal, gas and oil for power. Australia’s only nuclear reactor, at Lucas Heights, south of Sydney, is for scientific and medical research, and produces mostly low-level waste. Why has the idea been revived now? Nuclear power appears to solve a political dilemma. As it does not rely on fossil fuels, some who care about the climate emergency see it as the fastest way to deliver zero-carbon power. Others who rightly point out that moving away from fossil fuels will hit working-class regions hardest see the “dispatchable power” offered by nuclear reactors as the basis of a new social compact that will pay high salaries while “firming” up the grid. On Monday BHP’s vice-president of sustainability and climate, Dr Fiona Wild, called for Australia to consider nuclear due to the urgency of the threat of climate collapse. “We don’t have time to choose our favourite technologies any more, we kind of need to take an ‘all of the above’ approach because the challenge is so great and the pace at which we need to move is so fast that you want to make sure you have all those options available,” Wild said. On Tuesday the Australian newspaper’s contributing economics editor, Judith Sloan, defended the “plight of nuclear power”. “As an energy crisis affects most of the world, with soaring gas, coal and electricity prices, it is surely time for Australia to have a rational debate about nuclear power leading to a definite outcome,” Sloan said. Do the costs and benefits make sense? The idea of establishing a nuclear power industry has been periodically investigated by governments. South Australia did the homework for the rest of the nation in 2015 with a royal commission. A federal parliamentary inquiry followed up in 2019. The results were mixed. The royal commission concluded nuclear power was out of reach. The federal inquiry recommended that any such project should only go ahead if there was broad support from the public – an extremely unlikely prospect. While both reports agreed “next generation” reactors showed promise, nuclear power as a whole remained a time and money sink. As of 2019, the cost of a nuclear power plant had risen to US$1bn for 100MW of generation capacity. Construction of a commercial-scale plant would take at least 15 years. If Australia had started work on a nuclear reactor before the pandemic, it would not be in operation until about 2035. The small or “modular” reactors that are held up as the future of the industry won’t be affordable until 2050. Could they help to reduce emissions? Nuclear power is not carbon neutral. While the act of generating power itself is fairly efficient and low-emitting, the process of mining the uranium, trucking it somewhere to be refined and pouring the concrete to build the plant creates significant emissions. As uranium is a finite resource, nuclear power is also not “renewable”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Renewables, of course, share similar problems because so many other systems still rely on fossil fuels – wind turbine towers require steel, PV solar cells need resins, everything relies on diesel to transport it – but the total CO2 emissions are minute and the rapid rate of installation means there is a better shot at decarbonising these processes more quickly than with nuclear. With dirt cheap PV solar and rapid improvements being made in hydrogen and battery technology, it will only get easier. What about stabilising the grid? Critics of renewable energy sources say they do not have the capacity to respond to periods of high electricity demand with “dispatchable power” on calm, cloudy days, because they depend on the wind and sun. Nuclear, it is argued, can substitute effectively for the industrial-scale fossil fuel plants now in use that can idle up or down according to demand. The problems with renewables are real but they are becoming less of a roadblock. Plans are in train to make Australia’s power grid more decentralised with a combination of PV solar, offshore wind and onshore wind working to pick up any slack in the system when one goes offline. With the addition of battery technology to store and deliver electricity on demand, the business case for nuclear starts to look pretty thin. The challenge of renewables Thanks to the uptake of PV solar on rooftops it is costing coal and gas power plants more to keep running during periods of low demand and high supply. Operators are faced with a choice: push through or power down. In Australia, operators of ageing coal plants have so far chosen to push through but, as periods of oversupply become more frequent, the costs will make it more attractive to turn off the generator. Firing them back up again is another expensive process – one not shared by renewables, which can be turned on or off quickly. Australia is a long way from hitting peak renewable energy, and there is time to resolve the challenges associated with it long before any nuclear plant would have a chance to make it off a whiteboard. Should trends hold, breaking ground on a new nuclear plant today would mean committing to a white elephant that would be too expensive even to turn on. Any other problems? All of this is without even talking about plans to handle the decommissioning of old nuclear reactors at the end of their lifecycle or the storage of spent nuclear fuel – another expensive, time-consuming process. Australia already struggles with decommissioning and rehabilitating old mine sites, and nuclear power presents new challenges. There are few good facilities anywhere in the world with a geology or a political environment stable enough to store this material long term. During its royal commission, SA considered building its own facility to store waste but failed to get support from the public, thanks in part to the legacy of nuclear weapons testing at Maralinga. The federal government is working on a separate plan to build a storage facility for low-level and intermediate waste at Kimba in SA but the process has proved divisive. Under the proposal, this facility would not be equipped to handle spent nuclear fuel, and to scale it up would mean starting all over again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/22/where-are-the-women-at-the-top-of-chinese-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-23T08:35:56Z","webTitle":"Women pushed even further from power in Xi Jinping’s China","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/22/where-are-the-women-at-the-top-of-chinese-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/22/where-are-the-women-at-the-top-of-chinese-politics","fields":{"bodyText":"Across seven decades of turmoil and change, one thing about China’s leadership has remained unchanged. It is all-male. Men led China into the famine of the Great Leap Forward, through the convulsions of the Cultural Revolution and during the economic opening of the 1980s and 90s. In Xi Jinping’s “new era” of digital authoritarianism, men remain in charge of the country. The Communist party has run China for 70 years, and in that time no woman has ever been a member of China’s Politburo Standing Committee, the small group that runs the country, much less led the party or been made president or premier. Today under Xi, the CCP took a step back, also eliminating women from the next level of power too, the now 24-member Politburo. The new all-male line-up was revealed the day Xi formally extended his rule for a further five years, after the closing of the 20th Communist party congress in Beijing. Since 1997, there had always been at least one female Politburo member, and briefly two. A quota system required at least one woman in senior leadership at each level below that, contributing a small but steady stream of candidates. The Covid tsar, Sun Chunlan, was the only woman on the outgoing Politburo, and one of only three women who have made it that far as political operators in their own right – rather than as wives of powerful men or propaganda tools – in over 70 years of Communist rule. Her politburo seat was thought to be earmarked for another woman after she stepped down, with two candidates named as likely frontrunners. But in a weekend of disturbing surprises, including the manhandling of former President Hu Jintao off the stage, the CCP revealed an all-male Politburo. “Chinese women have been excluded from the centre of political power at both local and central levels,” said Hsiu-hua Shen, professor of Sociology at Taiwan’s National Tsing Hua University, before the conference closed. “Without specific affirmative actions … it is very difficult for Chinese women to be able to enter political systems and shape policies.” An uneasy relationship The party was formed during a civil war, in a highly patriarchal society and has been based on “masculine violence” and power struggles since its establishment, Shen added. The CCP has nearly 100 million members, but less than a third of the rank and file are women, and the numbers thin out, the higher up its ranks you climb. “China’s patriarchal political structure limits women’s upward mobility,” said Pan Wang, senior lecturer in Chinese and Asian studies at the University of New South Wales. “From the bottom to the top of the pyramid, women get fewer at each step of the hierarchy (from CCP members, to the party congress, central committee and the politburo). This can create biases in the nomination and selection process for leading positions in the party/state.” Chinese women are held back by a variety of factors, Pan said. They include cultural expectations that women do more in the home, a career structure that forces them to retire earlier than men, just as they might be reaching their professional peak, and education and socialisation that discourages them from political ambitions. The CCP has always had an uneasy relationship with feminists, in part because Communists claim to have liberated women themselves. Mao’s slogan “women hold up half the sky” became famous as half-tribute, half-promise to China’s women. That makes any woman still fighting for her rights potentially subversive, particularly at a time when Xi is openly distrustful of any civil organising. There have been repeated crackdowns on feminists, including arrests of women protesting against issues that do not obviously challenge the political system, such as sexual harassment. China’s #MeToo movement has made little progress. Among the ranks of assembled dignitaries at the Party congress was Zhang Gaoli, the former vice-premier whom tennis champion Peng Shuai publicly accused of sexual assault last year. Peng went missing for weeks after making her accusations on social media. She was eventually seen in public after a high-profile international campaign, organised under the hashtag #WhereIsPengShuai, but has since kept a very low profile and said her post was misunderstood, while he still commands the political stage. “The CCP is still quite traditional when it comes to women at the very top. Recent crackdowns on feminist activists have further signalled a more traditionalist and conservative line,” said Mary Gallagher, professor of democracy, democratization and human rights at the University of Michigan. Communism made it easier for women to get an education and join the workforce, but as in many other countries they were still expected to do the majority of domestic work, a “double shift” that is tiring and limits career opportunities. With a falling birthrate on the brink of tipping China’s already fast-ageing population into decline, there is increasing pressure on young people to have more children. Academics and campaigners fear that may further hobble women’s hopes of getting more political power in China. “I fear that in the short term, China will follow other countries and restrict women’s access to abortion and contraception as a way to force women to have more children. Ultimately, these policies will backfire and fail, but they could increase repression and crackdowns on feminist politics,” Gallagher said. ‘One woman is OK’ Requiring a minimal role for female cadres has opened the door a crack, but as the new Politburo line-up showed, has not changed a misogynist political culture. “The party has addressed it but in a relatively vague manner, if you look at the party constitution, there is a line about promoting women party members in leadership,” said Minglu Chen, senior lecturer in the Department of Government and International Relations at the University of Sydney. “In reality this policy has often been interpreted as “one woman is OK”, so there is only one woman. This obviously shows the quota system being adopted is effective, but more needs to be done.” And for nearly 700 million women who live in China, this is not just a matter of principle. “The one thing we could safely argue, with no woman in leadership, women’s issues would be under-represented.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/dec/06/the-guardian-view-on-myanmars-military-in-power-but-not-in-control","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-06T19:01:03Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Myanmar’s military: in power but not in control | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/06/the-guardian-view-on-myanmars-military-in-power-but-not-in-control","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/06/the-guardian-view-on-myanmars-military-in-power-but-not-in-control","fields":{"bodyText":"In February 2021, Myanmar’s army ended its decade-long, grudging tolerance of limited democracy by launching a coup, detaining Aung San Suu Kyi and other elected civilian politicians. Since then, its ruthlessness has only increased. The number of political prisoners has soared to more than 13,000. The junta has resumed executions for the first time in decades. The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, said last Friday that the regime was using the death penalty to crush political opposition, expressing shock that 130 people have been sentenced to death by military courts behind closed doors. Many of the 1,700 people who have stood trial have been denied access to lawyers or relatives. Not one has been acquitted. The pandemic, war in Ukraine and uprisings elsewhere have meant that the world has largely stopped paying attention to events in Myanmar, where the military is literally pursuing a scorched earth policy. It has razed villages that it accuses of supporting the opposition and has bombed hospitals, schools and even a concert. An estimated 1.3 million people are displaced and living in horrific conditions. It continues to add to the raft of convictions and prison terms for Aung San Suu Kyi. Rights groups report extrajudicial killings by soldiers and militias. The assumption at first was that the military, long expert in suppressing stirrings of dissent and democracy, would soon reassert control. Even when some protesters took up arms – and the pro-democracy national unity government backed a “defensive war” – it seemed a hopeless endeavour, given their lack of money, equipment and training. Yet the resistance has been not only remarkably protracted but – under the circumstances – surprisingly effective. Civilian militias, working alongside some of the ethnic armed groups that were already battling the state, are carrying out attacks on military bases and in previously untouchable central areas. Soldiers are said to be quitting or defecting. The junta has also relied on Russia for much of its weaponry – though it can still count on China, India and others. Each fresh abuse by the regime gives opponents reason to fight on – no one believes it will compromise. Elections are promised next year, but the power seizure resulted from the military’s repeated failure to win at the ballot box, and opponents are all locked up. The regime made a vague attempt at PR by releasing 6,000 or more prisoners last month, including a former British ambassador, Vicky Bowman. But some were detained again on the same day, and the total number of those held soon rebounded. The junta remains grotesquely self-serving, with its chief, Min Aung Hlaing, spending a reported $33m on honours to keep its friends on side – in the process awarding himself two titles, one of which comes with an elaborate gold and ruby medal. Sanctions should remain carefully targeted at those in the regime and their families. Though supporters of the democracy movement praise the UK for taking the lead internationally, they believe much more must be done. They make a strong case for cutting off the supply of aviation fuel – used by the military even when it has supposedly been destined for civil flights. The junta’s increasing brutality, however, is a sign of fear as well as further evidence of its viciousness. Some of those struggling for democracy now speak not of a coup, but an attempted coup; thanks to the resistance, they say, it has not yet succeeded. They need more support to ensure that it does not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jun/03/us-china-war-not-inevitable-albanese-says-urging-countries-to-prevent-a-worst-case-scenario","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-02T15:00:05Z","webTitle":"US-China war not inevitable, Albanese says, urging countries to ‘prevent a worst-case scenario’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/03/us-china-war-not-inevitable-albanese-says-urging-countries-to-prevent-a-worst-case-scenario","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jun/03/us-china-war-not-inevitable-albanese-says-urging-countries-to-prevent-a-worst-case-scenario","fields":{"bodyText":"Anthony Albanese has warned against “harmful” assumptions that the US and China are heading towards an inevitable war, and called for “practical structures to prevent a worst-case scenario”. The Australian prime minister said a war in the Indo-Pacific would be “devastating for the world” and used a keynote speech to a regional security summit in Singapore to urge all countries to uphold peace and stability. Albanese also sought to reassure countries in the region that remain wary about Australia’s plan to acquire nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus pact. “In boosting our nation’s defence capability, Australia’s goal is not to prepare for war but to prevent it, through deterrence and reassurance and building resilience in the region.” Albanese said it must be “crystal clear that when it comes to any unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force – be it in Taiwan, the South China Sea, the East China Sea or elsewhere – the risk of conflict will always far outweigh any potential reward”. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, and the Chinese defence minister, Li Shangfu, are among security officials and analysts from more than 40 countries attending the three-day Shangri-La Dialogue. Albanese is accompanied on the trip by his defence minister, Richard Marles, who is expected to meet with Li this weekend. Marles attended the same summit last year in what marked the end of China’s freeze on high-level dialogue with Australia. Albanese said it was “dangerously wrong” for anyone to describe the region as “a potential ‘theatre’ for conflict, as if this is merely a backdrop, a location, an arena for the ambitions of others”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The prime minister said no one should dismiss “the agency and ambition of a majority of the world’s population and the engine room of the global economy” or see the future of the region as a “foregone conclusion”. He drew parallels to “flawed” and “complacent” assumptions after the cold war that globalisation and free trade would create a more open, stable world. Albanese pointed to “the rise of nativism and isolationism” and “the biggest conventional military build-up since the second world war” – the latter referring to China. But he said the fate of the Indo-Pacific was “not preordained”. “To move from imagining conflict is impossible to assuming war is inevitable is just as harmful to our shared goals,” he said. Albanese sought to reassure south-east Asia that his government sees the region in positive terms, not just as a venue for geopolitical rivalry. “I can assure you that when Australia looks north, we don’t see a void for others to impose their will,” he said. “We see a community of nations whose actions and decisions are essential to building prosperity and preserving peace in the Indo-Pacific.” Albanese also said the citizens of the region had shown “an unflinching commitment” to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. He described such weapons as “destructive, inhumane and indiscriminate” and called for cooperative action to “drive disarmament”. Backing the concept of “guardrails” to manage tensions between the US and China, Albanese said Australia strongly supported the Biden administration’s push to establish “reliable and open channels of communication” with Beijing. “This isn’t about a policy of containment; it’s not a question of placing obstacles in the way of any nation’s progress or potential,” he said. “This is a matter of simple, practical structures to prevent a worst-case scenario.” He said despite a difference of “worldviews” and “values”, Australia was placing dialogue at the heart of its efforts to stabilise relations with China. “Because the alternative – the silence of the diplomatic deep freeze – only breeds suspicion, only makes it easier for nations to attribute motive to misunderstanding, to assume the worst of one another,” Albanese said. Albanese urged China to remove “impediments” to trade with Australia. The federal opposition has backed dialogue with China but has started to question whether it is leading to tangible outcomes. The shadow foreign minister, Simon Birmingham, told ABC Radio National on Friday that China was “continuing to impose punishment and coercion upon Australia”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/apr/03/beastly-a-new-history-of-animals-and-us-by-keggie-carew-review-the-terrible-price-of-people-power","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-03T08:00:44Z","webTitle":"Beastly: A New History of Animals and Us by Keggie Carew review – the terrible price of people power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/03/beastly-a-new-history-of-animals-and-us-by-keggie-carew-review-the-terrible-price-of-people-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/apr/03/beastly-a-new-history-of-animals-and-us-by-keggie-carew-review-the-terrible-price-of-people-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Picture the scene. It’s 350BCE, and Aristotle – presumably looking a bit like Sir David Attenborough, except in a toga – is collecting creatures from the teeming rock pools around the Greek island of Lesbos. He’s beavering away on his scala naturae – a “natural ladder” that puts everything in the natural world in a hierarchy that has animate things such as minerals at the bottom, then plants above them, followed by animals. And of course, at the top of the ladder, tottering maniacally over everything else: humans. Beastly is Keggie Carew’s messy but heartfelt account of the environmental catastrophe unleashed by this barmily Trumpian idea of Aristotle’s that we’re somehow superior to the rest of nature. As Carew convincingly argues, the influential scala naturae “paved the philosophical way – nature was to serve us”. Over 380 or so charmingly meandering pages, Carew attempts to unpick Aristotle’s folly and fix “humanity’s big error – our interactions with the planet’s other inhabitants”. She does this in part by recounting the story of our intellectual journey – from ancient Greece to today – as philosophers, theologians and scientists first built on, then started to break away from, Aristotle’s worldview. Carew, author of the Costa book award-winning memoir Dadland (2016), does a great job of rattling through centuries of dusty theological thought and the way the likes of Saint Augustine and Thomas Aquinas fatefully concluded that animals don’t have souls so aren’t worthy of our care, or even our pity. As she observes, pithily: “Advocacy for kindness to fellow creatures under the Abrahamic god has never really caught on.” But over the past 20 years or so, scientific research has started to chip away at this human-centric view. In 2012, scientists from around the world signed the Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness, announcing that “the weight of evidence” shows “all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses” are conscious beings – a revolutionary moment, because it proves that animals aren’t “dumb beasts” that we can use and abuse, but feel pain and other emotions. Carew, though, isn’t especially wowed by this scientific sea change: “The extraordinary thing is that it took so long. More extraordinary still, perhaps, is that it needed to be stated at all.” Alongside this potted history of our philosophical understanding of nature, Carew describes, in myriad moving ways, the colossal environmental damage caused by our wrong-headedness. From the destruction of wild habitats (only 2.9% of land on Earth is “faunally intact” – the rest tarnished or ruined) to biodiversity loss everywhere, the book is brimming with examples of irrevocable harm. “Wherever we showed up,” notes Carew, darkly, “extinctions followed.” She writes poignantly about the suffering of the beautiful baiji, the Chinese river dolphin that was gradually overwhelmed by pollution, noise and over-fishing: “The baiji took more than 20m years of evolution to refine, and 50 years of grand communist-capitalist ideology to rub out.” The book’s structure is confusing at times, jumping between Carew’s personal memories, facts about one species or another and wide-ranging summaries of human history. Then again, maybe she is trying to mimic Charles Darwin’s famous “tangled bank” metaphor for how everything in nature is connected. Indeed, Carew is especially compelling when it comes to this interrelatedness, where the dying out of one species can cause entire ecosystems to decline and fall. Sea otters, for instance, were wiped out on America’s coasts, which meant that the urchins they ate multiplied unchecked, which in turn caused entire kelp forests to fail – killing off their inhabitants, including the gentle 10-tonne Steller’s sea cow. The disappearance of one creature can spell doom on a much larger scale. As Carew warns us: “We mess with these interactions at our peril, for they’re so immensely complex we do not understand them.” In place of Aristotle’s egocentric ladder, Beastly is a clarion call for the humbler notion that every bit of nature matters: “Our banners must shout more expansively: Save the whale! Save the krill! Save the phytoplankton! Save everything in between!” Time and again, Carew comes back to the psychological impact that losing wild places is having on us – sometimes called “solastalgia”: the sadness we feel as we wander through landscapes unnaturally devoid of insects, birds and animals. For Carew, as for many of us, this melancholy has given way to something darker: “A close cousin of solastalgia is eco-furiosity, an eco-tear-your-hair-out solastalgia on steroids. It is the long loud, desperate cry of the human heart.” The only hope for our battered planet is that we come to appreciate the wondrous interconnectedness of living things. As Carew wistfully puts it: “When we understand, we begin to care.” • Beastly: A New History of Animals and Us by Keggie Carew is published by Canongate (£20).

Our message is clear: in the base case our analysis indicates that supply margins are expected to be adequate, however this winter will undoubtedly be challenging. Therefore, all of us in the electricity system operator (ESO) are working round the clock to manage the system, ensure the flow of energy and do our bit to keep costs down for consumers. One of the tools we have developed is the demand flexibility service. From November, this new capability will reward homes and businesses for shifting their electricity consumption at peak times. And we are working with the government, businesses and energy providers to encourage as high a level of take-up as possible. We are confident this innovative approach can provide at least 2 gigawatts of power – about a million homes’ worth. What began as an initiative to help achieve net zero and keep costs down is also proving to be an important tool in ensuring Britain’s energy security. We are particularly keen to get businesses involved right across Britain. When the Guardian first reported on this service we had calls from businesses ranging from multinationals to an owner of a fish and chip shop asking how they could do their bit and get signed up. We can now confirm our proposals for how much people and businesses can be paid for shifting their electricity use outside peak times. We anticipate paying a rate of £3,000 per megawatt hour. Businesses and homes can become virtual power plants and, crucially, get paid like one too. For a consumer that could mean a typical household could save approximately £100, and industrial and commercial businesses with larger energy usage could save multiples of this. We are working with Ofgem to get this scheme launched in November and for it to be rolled out through energy suppliers. If you are interested in participating, or understanding what you could get paid, please contact your energy supplier. Innovations such as these have never mattered more. Vladimir Putin’s unlawful aggression means we are facing unprecedented energy market volatility and pressures on energy supplies this winter. As a result of Russia’s war in Ukraine, European gas is scarce and prices are high. Alongside this, France’s nuclear fleet has experienced a higher number of outages than expected. Energy shortages in Europe could have knock-on implications for energy supply in Britain. We have put in place additional contingency arrangements for this winter. For example, the ability to call on generators to fire-up emergency coal units, giving Britain 2GW of additional capacity. We need to be clear, it is possible that without these measures supply could be interrupted for some customers for limited periods of time. This could eventually force us to initiate a temporary rota of planned electricity outages, meaning that some customers could be without power for up to three hours at a time through a process called the electricity supply emergency code (ESEC). Under the ESEC process we would advise the public the day before any disconnections. We are working with government and industry on planning for this so that the message can be spread across all communities as quickly and accurately as possible. This would include press conferences, social media campaigns, and working with influencers in different communities. That’s the worst-case scenario, which our analysis tells us is unlikely to become a reality. Our base case is that security of supply margins will be adequate through the winter. We will do everything in our power to mitigate and minimise any risks to Britain’s security of supply. We are better placed than our neighbours on the continent to respond because Britain already has one of the cleanest, most reliable electricity systems in the world. Long-term, maintaining this lead will help guarantee our energy security and keep costs down. • Fintan Slye is the director of National Grid’s electricity system operator"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/dec/07/world-cup-2022-power-rankings-how-the-remaining-eight-teams-shape-up-qatar","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-07T14:21:41Z","webTitle":"World Cup 2022 power rankings: how the remaining eight teams shape up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/07/world-cup-2022-power-rankings-how-the-remaining-eight-teams-shape-up-qatar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/dec/07/world-cup-2022-power-rankings-how-the-remaining-eight-teams-shape-up-qatar","fields":{"bodyText":"The Seleção are in full flight and, as you may have heard, enjoying themselves in the process. Their first-half evisceration of South Korea felt like a throwback, moments such as Richarlison’s seal impression offering reminders of those days when nobody could rival Brazil for sheer fun. Even without Gabriel Jesus they retain a depth of attacking talent few can match, partly thanks to Neymar’s Lazarus-like recovery from injury. Keep this up and a first World Cup since 2002 should be theirs, although there are caveats: they squeaked past Switzerland, the only practised tournament side they have faced, and Croatia should offer an even sterner test on Friday. Alisson Becker was also worked harder than he may have liked on Monday night, although he demonstrated the value of a top-class keeper in the process. Can anyone stop them? Sometimes it feels France’s plan is to send possession Kylian Mbappé’s way and say: “You do the rest.” The problem for their opponents is that it tends to work. Anyone who can halt Mbappé may be able to stop Les Bleus but he is in virtually unplayable form and already looks a safe bet for the Golden Boot. Didier Deschamps will also be encouraged that the supporting cast is showing signs of life and France, who have scored nine goals across the three games in which he has selected a first-choice side, may be clicking at the right time. The evergreen Olivier Giroud adds a valuable balance while Aurélien Tchouaméni has taken to life as their midfield linchpin. Further injuries would give Deschamps a headache but the core look in lean shape. That wasn’t so difficult, was it? Now that Fernando Santos has, perhaps terminally, cut the cord with Cristiano Ronaldo the tournament seems alive with possibility for Portugal. They were devastating against Switzerland, a rejuvenated frontline slicing their unusually loose opponents open at will and Gonçalo Ramos coming from nowhere to become a potential star of this winter. Beating decent Ghana and Uruguay sides in the group stage was further evidence of the weapons Santos has in his armoury, which include a potent substitute in Rafael Leão. They will not be devastated at facing Morocco on Saturday, who spent 120 minutes on a highly rewarding but hugely exacting task in defeating Spain. Could Ronaldo’s much-sought World Cup be won from the sidelines? Gareth Southgate’s players will find France a clear step up from several lower-key assignments but it would not take an over-active imagination to see them pull through on Saturday. There were rocky moments early on against Senegal but England have some of the best young players in the tournament – Jude Bellingham has announced himself as an essential pick – and are a gripping proposition when on the front foot. When they are denied space, much of their possession can appear sterile: France will know that and may be content to utilise their own speed through counterattacks. But Harry Kane has opened his account, the midfield looks well-balanced and defensive bloopers have been minimised: could it be coming home for Christmas? Every Argentina match in Doha feels like appointment viewing, if not for the fare produced by Lionel Scaloni’s team then for the jaw-dropping support that turns stadiums into pulsating places of worship. La Albiceleste have only shone in flashes but have done well to banish that remarkable defeat by Saudi Arabia, and one thing is clear: Lionel Messi is already enjoying his best World Cup, scoring three times and operating on a different level to everyone else. There are signs his younger teammates are raising theirs: Julián Álvarez is showing why Manchester City brought him to the Etihad and the Benfica midfielder Enzo Fernández looks an outstanding talent. They still need to put it together against the best but with supporters that make it feel like they have home advantage, Argentina have a chance. There is a sense Louis van Gaal’s team has flown beneath the radar so far but, like others, they are stirring at a convenient point. Critics accused them of boring football during an unremarkable group stage but Memphis Depay and Cody Gakpo – the latter was certainly exempt from criticism in earlier games – shone against the USA and Denzel Dumfries was outstanding at right wing-back. Frenkie de Jong was also back to his best and their tie with Argentina, a reprise of previous classics, looks finely poised. The Netherlands are unbeaten in 19 games since Van Gaal’s return and, while he would still like greater control in possession, can be rapier-like in the transition. If Messi is to land the biggest prize, he has a stiff hurdle to overcome on Friday. Morocco showed in the group stage that they are a serious team and everyone is awake to that now after they dumped Spain out. Walid Regragui oversees a tough, clever unit with extraordinary tactical discipline and an attack capable of the unexpected. The only goal they have conceded was a consolation in the win over Canada and that is some achievement given they have played Croatia, Belgium and Spain. Shutting out Portugal on Saturday would top the lot and Morocco have a chance. In Achraf Hakimi they possess a genuine star, while Luis Enrique can testify to the qualities of the midfield whirlwind, Azzedine Ounahi. And nobody can discount a flash of genius from Hakim Ziyech. Africa has never had a representative in the last four and Morocco are a win away from making history. You know the old saying: never write off the Croatians. In all seriousness, Zlatko Dalic’s team have a whiff of past Germany sides about them: they never know when they are beaten and, while they are creaking in some departments, few know their way around a tournament more adeptly. They were on the ropes against a sparky Japan but pulled through; Ivan Perisic’s equaliser was a reminder that half this squad still boasts several World Cup finalists and that counts for plenty when fine margins need navigating. Whether they can handle Brazil’s attacking tempo remains to be seen but it would be foolhardy to rule them out on Friday.

Jeremy Hunt, chancellor of the exchequer, was a self-styled “green Tory” as a backbencher, and in his speech gave a nod towards the UK’s green ambitions with a boost for nuclear power and for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. But missing from the budget was any hint of the hoped-for focus on home insulation, any strengthening of the windfall tax on record oil and gas profits, or removal of the barriers to onshore windfarms. Instead, the continuing freeze on fuel duty will benefit drivers of fuel-guzzling SUVs, and would leave the UK on the starting blocks while other countries – including the US, the EU and China – are racing ahead in creating green jobs, analysts said. Luke Murphy, associate director for energy and climate at the IPPR thinktank, said: “There is a global race to the top in reaching net zero, and the UK now risks falling seriously behind our competitors. The government needs to learn the lessons from the US and Europe, ramp up public investment, and bring forward a green industrial strategy, safeguarding our economy and environment for the future.” Hunt repeated his mantra of four Es for the UK’s future investment – enterprise, education, employment and everywhere. Josh Burke, senior policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute, part of the London School of Economics, said: “This budget has failed to deliver a long-term, economy-wide investment plan to accelerate the transition to sustainable and resilient growth. The two Es missing from the industrial strategy are the environment and energy.” Ami McCarthy, political campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said the focus on small nuclear plants, called small modular reactors, and CCS, both early-stage technologies, missed out far more realistic opportunities to pursue low-carbon power. “This misguided budget shows the stranglehold fossil fuel and nuclear lobbies have on this government. Why else would it take such a dangerous gamble on unproven technologies?” she asked. “Squandering taxpayers’ money on nuclear reactors that don’t even exist yet and fanciful carbon capture is irresponsible, and does nothing to reduce our emissions now.” Hunt announced no new spending on home insulation, and did not bring forward spending on energy efficiency allocated for 2025, despite clear research showing that insulation can keep people’s homes warmer amid high energy bills, and calls from the government’s own statutory climate adviser, the Climate Change Committee, to prioritise insulation. Ross Matthewman, head of policy and campaigns at the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, said: “We are disappointed that the chancellor appears to be taking his foot off the pedal. By failing to bring forward planned spending on energy efficiency measures, he has missed a golden opportunity to both reduce energy bills and decarbonise the housing sector.” Transport policy was another missed opportunity, added Alfie Stirling, director of research and chief economist at the New Economics Foundation. Drivers of larger cars are the biggest winners from the continuing freeze on fuel duty, while people on lower incomes are more likely to use lower-carbon public transport. “The government is continuing to subsidise polluting travel and disproportionately benefiting higher earners, with the 13th freeze on fuel duty in a row,” said Stirling. After the budget announcement, the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, told MPs he was “busting a gut” to get solar power on rooftops, including those of large buildings such as warehouses. He told the environmental audit committee he was working to remove the requirement for planning permission for solar installations above 1MW, which was inhibiting installations on the roofs of commercial buildings. But he indicated he would not mandate solar power on the rooftops of new houses, as some MPs urged him to do. He said the government would require, in its forthcoming future homes standard, that new homes must produce 75% less carbon dioxide than homes built in 2013, but that ministers would leave up to housebuilders how this was achieved, because mandating particular technologies would “reduce innovation”, he claimed. “There is more than one way to skin a cat,” he told MPs. “The hesitation is over saying ‘this is the only thing you can put in’.” Shapps also promised a far greater green push to come, after the budget. The government is obliged by a high court ruling last year to publish by the end of this month clear plans on how to reach the net zero target. A response to the review of the net zero target by Chris Skidmore, published early this year, will come out at the same time. The announcement, due in a fortnight, will contain plans to boost hydrogen, wind power, solar energy and heat pumps, according to Shapps. “There will be much more I can say then,” he told MPs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/apr/05/no-phone-no-internet-no-power-no-money-it-was-like-being-sent-back-to-the-victorian-era","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-05T03:57:19Z","webTitle":"No phone, no internet, no power, no money – it was like being sent back to the Victorian era | Caitlin Cassidy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/05/no-phone-no-internet-no-power-no-money-it-was-like-being-sent-back-to-the-victorian-era","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/05/no-phone-no-internet-no-power-no-money-it-was-like-being-sent-back-to-the-victorian-era","fields":{"bodyText":"I didn’t intend to spend my Sunday hacking at gargantuan weeds with a half-broken set of pruning shears in the rain. But the universe – or, more accurately, a unique combination of bad luck and stupid decisions – had conspired against me, leaving me with no phone, no internet, no power, no money and nothing to do but tend to my overgrown garden. I am known to be a forgetful person. Among things I have lost are keys, wallets, bike locks, prized jewellery, hats (many, many hats), jackets, library books and credit cards. So it didn’t exactly bowl me down with surprise when I awoke on a Saturday morning to the realisation that at some point between a gig, an Uber ride and a late-night board game, my iPhone had gone missing. This was the fifth phone I had lost (four domestically, one at a Rastafarian bar in the northern foothills of Thailand). As such, I’ve become accustomed to periods of accidentally enforced phone withdrawals, and don’t consider myself a social media junkie. I took the temporary loss of my connection to the outside world in my stride, spending Saturday cooking with my housemate and wandering the park with my dog. I even found myself thinking with some sense of humble reverence how nice it was to “switch off” for a moment and appreciate the little things – a child playing with their mother, a community sausage sizzle, my dog bounding across an oval with his tongue lolling out. What I didn’t expect was waking up on day two without a phone to a major power outage, courtesy of an ancient house with old wiring and a bucketload of rain overnight. Suddenly, my other technological devices were rendered useless. How was I supposed to idly scroll Twitter, Facebook and Instagram on my laptop? How was I supposed to stream bad reality tv on Netflix? How was I supposed to Google random things – like the last time Carlton was in a grand final with Collingwood (1988), or the price of Gwyneth Paltrow’s vagina candle (approximately $100)? Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads As a millennial, I straddle the divide between dial-up internet and the explosion of Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. I still remember getting my first mobile as a prepubescent child - a red flip-phone that I adorned with gems and used primarily to play the retro Nokia game Snake. Even in those days, technology was rife in my life, from my Nintendo DS to nights on MSN and Club Penguin (if you know, you know). Now, I had found myself in a Survivor-esque situation, or something like one of those shows where they send families back to the 1800s in Victorian-era clothing. To make matters worse, my bank card had been missing for about a week, tucked in a rarely used bag or jacket, I had assumed, and I’d been relying on my phone’s digital wallet to pay for everything in my life. And I’d allow my car to run almost completely out of petrol. So here I was, a Rapunzel locked in my tower as the contents of our fridge slowly warmed to room temperature and rain pooled into mud-piles in the yard. But I could do this! Nay, my housemates and I could do this! We set to work, sticking a candle into one of the previous night’s empty wine bottles and positioning it in the toilet so nobody would be required to poo in the dark. Gazing at the flickering wick, burning softly by toilet paper rolls, and the slow trickle of water from our semi-broken latrine, it almost looked like a highly valuable modern art installation. “The Fountain of Youth,” a housemate whispered. For the first hour, I was determined to make the most of a bad situation. I began a 1,000 piece puzzle, completed the edges and read the newspaper from front to back. I cleaned the house, emptied the bins and brushed my dog. By hour three, I had begun vacantly roaming the halls, dreaming of the adrenaline hit of a Twitter notification or an Instagram like. The world could literally have entered into nuclear war, I thought, and I wouldn’t know. By hour five, I had lost it. Distraction – I needed it desperately. My dog and the house were pristine. There was no other option. I grabbed a pair of shears and boots and hit the front yard. Sopping wet, with a slightly mad look in my eye, I hacked away, as dog-walkers walked by with umbrellas and telephones and, probably, working power-points. The universe had tested me, and I had proven it right. I went to bed. That night, with the power finally restored courtesy of a very kind electrician who mysteriously went by “Mr White”, my housemates and I sat in the kitchen and completed the puzzle together by lamplight. We barely spoke but for the slotting of a tricky piece, when we’d cry out in exultation. We were too focused. I didn’t think of my phone once."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-393-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-23T10:59:24Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 393 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-393-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-393-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine’s state emergency services said on Thursday that it had ended rescue attempts in Rzhyshchiv, Kyiv region, where it is now known that nine people died in a suspected Russian drone attack in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that on Wednesday shelling in the Donetsk region killed two people and injured four others, while one person was killed and two were wounded in the Kherson region. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian ground forces, said “The aggressor does not give up hope of taking Bakhmut at any cost, despite the losses in manpower and equipment”. He added that Russia is losing “considerable strength” and that “very soon we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we once did near Kyiv, Kharkiv, Balakliia and Kupiansk”, all areas that Ukraine has previously liberated from Russian occupation. The UK Ministry of Defence said that “Russia has made gains of up to several kilometres” in the Luhansk region, and that “Russian commanders are likely trying to expand a security zone west from the defence lines they have prepared along higher ground, and integrate the natural obstacle of the Oskil River. They likely seek to recapture Kupiansk, a logistics node.” Any attempt to arrest President Vladimir Putin after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for the Kremlin chief would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, his ally Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday, while directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen. A video is circulating on social media of the Ukrainian national flag flying from a tall mast in Crimea, a region annexed by Russia in 2014. It appears to have been filmed near the village of Hrushivka. Spain’s prime minister Pedro Sánchez said on Thursday he would discuss a peace plan for Ukraine with Chinese President Xi Jinping during an official visit to China next week. Estonia’s prime minister Kaja Kallas on Thursday spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia under a deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, and called for the G7 to tighten its oil cap to squeeze Russia’s revenue more. A former New Zealand soldier who drew an online following with his dispatches from the frontline of the Ukraine war has been killed. The death of Kane Te Tai, 38, was confirmed by New Zealand’s foreign ministry Thursday, citing Ukrainian government sources. Te Tai, who fought with the International Legion, is the third New Zealander known to have died in Ukraine. The UN nuclear agency’s chief said Wednesday that the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant “remains perilous” following a Russian missile strike this month that disconnected the plant from the grid. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant needs a reliable electricity supply to operate pumps that circulate water to cool reactors and pools holding nuclear fuel. Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia was a “journey of friendship, cooperation and peace”, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said Wednesday, as China’s president ended his three-day visit to Moscow. Wang Wenbin reiterated Beijing’s claims that it remained neutral in the Ukraine conflict and said China would “continue to play a constructive role in promoting a political settlement of the Ukrainian issue”. Vladimir Putin has no immediate plans for peace in Ukraine, so the west needs to brace itself to supply lethal aid to Kyiv for a long time to come, Nato’s secretary general has warned in an interview with the Guardian. The fierce fighting, currently centred around Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine, demonstrated Russia was willing “to just throw in thousands and thousands more troops, to take many casualties for minimal gains”, the head of Nato said. Russia’s foreign ministry has warned that Moscow will not leave “unanswered” a UK plan to supply Ukraine with tank shells made with depleted uranium. “This decision will not remain without serious consequences both for Russian-British bilateral relations and at the international level,” it said on Wednesday. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Britain’s decision took the situation to new and dangerous levels. The UK foreign secretary has said there is no “nuclear escalation” in the country’s decision to supply Ukraine with shells made with depleted uranium. “They are not nuclear munitions. They are purely conventional munitions,” James Cleverly said, a day after Vladimir Putin accused the west of “beginning to use weapons with a nuclear component”. The Prince of Wales travelled to Poland as part of a surprise two-day trip to Poland to thank British and Polish troops for their efforts supporting Ukraine, as well as to learn more about how the country has cared for displaced Ukrainian refugees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/25/jacinda-ardern-last-day-new-zealand-prime-minister-selfies-sendoffs-star-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-25T03:00:07Z","webTitle":"Selfies, sendoffs and star power as Jacinda Ardern has her last day in the sun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/25/jacinda-ardern-last-day-new-zealand-prime-minister-selfies-sendoffs-star-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/25/jacinda-ardern-last-day-new-zealand-prime-minister-selfies-sendoffs-star-power","fields":{"bodyText":"From the moment of her arrival, Jacinda Ardern is surrounded by a crush of people: hundreds gather to ask for final selfies, record video messages for friends and relatives, or simply watch her pass by. A group of running children weaves through bystanders’ legs, pushing for a better view. Over and over, she obliges, smiling for cameraphones, asking people’s names and jobs, cracking jokes, signing a worn blue and yellow basketball for a boy who pushes through the crowd. A politician who always excelled at creating moments of humour and human connection, Ardern’s much-discussed star power was firmly on display in the North Island village of Rātana on Tuesday for her last formal engagement as the prime minister of New Zealand. “It’s like, ‘touch her cloak, touch her cloak like Jesus’,” a woman laughs to her friend. “Where is she? Is she coming?” a girl asked, craning for a glimpse. “I just want to tell her thank you,” a woman outside the Rātana temple tells a policeman standing nearby. “For everything.” One man spends a minute vigorously and continuously shaking her hand. “You’re going to have to let go at some point,” an onlooker remarks, and the crowd laughs. New Zealand – and the world – is still reckoning with Ardern’s shock departure, the whirlwind selection of her replacement, and the question of how to define her political legacy. On her final full day as the country’s leader, however, some of the thornier and more controversial questions of her political legacy and legislative record seemed to fade into the background. *** Rātana traditionally marks the beginning of New Zealand’s political year, with party leaders descending on the village to give their first major speeches after the summer break. This year was different, it also marked the ending of an era. The scenes recalled some of the electric fandom Ardern provoked when she first took the leadership in 2017 – greeted by scrums of hopeful selfie-takers and fans. Five years of difficult decisions and political struggles had worn much of that glitter away, particularly in the polls, where voters had punished the prime minister and her party for a year of economic headwinds. But on Tuesday, the shine was back on. A few metres away, the incoming prime minister Chris Hipkins stands in a circle of reporters, answering questions – for the most part, the crowd doesn’t look his way. There was no sign on Tuesday of the small, furious knot of protesters who had become an increasingly recurrent presence at Ardern’s public appearances – sometimes bearing signs and anti-vaccine slogans, other times chasing her van and screaming obscenities. Ardern has said threats and abuse were not contributing factors to her resignation, but her departure has still prompted the start of an uncomfortable reckoning in New Zealand with the scope and volume of misogynistic, violent rhetoric, abuse and threats channelled the leader’s way. Speaking briefly to reporters, she said that her enduring experience of the job had been positive. “I would hate for anyone to view my departure as a negative commentary on New Zealand,” she said. “I have experienced such love, compassion, empathy and kindness in the job. That has been my predominant experience. So I leave feeling gratitude for having this wonderful role for so many years … My only words are words of thanks.” *** As they waited for the prime minister, tribal elders and politicians sheltered in plastic marquees from the blast of late-summer sun. The grass lining the roads to the marae (meeting place) has grown long and parched, worn down to fibre by the summer heat and signalling a season winding down. As her tenure ends, the question of Ardern’s ongoing influence on the direction and tone of New Zealand politics remains open. Even before she arrived at Rātana’s borders, the figure of Ardern loomed large over the political speeches of the day. Centre-right opposition leader Christopher Luxon made no explicit mention of the prime minister, but chose to speak about his vision of the “kindness politics” that she ushered in. We will “demonstrate kindness, demonstrate that we care, through careful stewardship of the economy”, he said – a choice of framing that seemed only to illustrate the degree to which Ardern had come to determine the language and frames of reference of New Zealand’s political conversation. Most of the leaders paid their tributes more overtly. “You were the captain calling the shots on the waka [canoe] that navigated us through truly tough times,” said Rahui Papa, a leader within the Tainui and Māori king movements. “You were the right person to lead our nation through terrible times,” said Che Wilson, previous president of the Māori party. “I wear my political allegiances here,” he said, pointing to the Indigenous designs patterning his attire, “but prime minister, it is only right that we say thank you,” he said, as the crowd erupted into applause. Asked if she had a parting word for the public, the prime minister said she would not be disappearing entirely. “You will see me out and about, but you won’t see me in the centre, in the cut and thrust of politics,” she said. On whether she would miss that, Ardern replied simply: “I’m going to miss people. Because that’s been the joy of the job.” *** The celebrations at Rātana are an appropriate final bookend for Ardern’s term. In 2018 – just two months into her prime ministership and a few days after her pregnancy with daughter Neve was announced – she appeared at Rātana. That year, Rātana elders offered her a Māori middle name for her child: Waru, a sacred number for the church. Over the years that followed, the gathering has marked milestones and moments of Ardern’s tenure as a leader – and watched her family grow up, with Neve occasionally making appearances to toddle through the crowds, chased by security guards. In a final, brief standup for reporters, Ardern said it was spending more time in that role – as mother and family member – that she was looking forward to. “I’m ready to be lots of things,” she said. “I’m ready to be a backbench MP. I’m ready to be a sister, and a mum.” Then she turned, replaced her sunglasses, and walked away from the last cluster of microphones she would face as prime minister."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/feb/13/cyclone-gabrielle-new-zealand-regional-states-of-emergency-evacuation-declared-auckland-as-storm-approaches","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-13T06:06:16Z","webTitle":"Auckland at a standstill as storm leaves thousands in North Island without power – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/feb/13/cyclone-gabrielle-new-zealand-regional-states-of-emergency-evacuation-declared-auckland-as-storm-approaches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/feb/13/cyclone-gabrielle-new-zealand-regional-states-of-emergency-evacuation-declared-auckland-as-storm-approaches","fields":{"bodyText":"Before we close down our live blog, here is a quick summary of today’s developments. You can also read our full report by our New Zealand correspondent, Tess McClure. Gabrielle is currently sitting 250km (155 miles) north-west of New Zealand’s coast and is forecast to move close to the east coast over the next 24 hours. Thousands of homes across the country are currently without power. Electricity is out for 46,000 homes, cell service is patchy in some areas and trees have come down and roofs lifted off. The emergency management minister, Kieran McAnulty, said it would be a “critical day” due to the “highly dangerous” combination of high winds and heavy rain. Almost all of the top half of the North Island has been covered by localised states of emergency including in Auckland – New Zealand’s largest city of 1.7 million people – as well as in Northland, Coromandel, Ōpōtiki, Whakatāne, Tairāwhiti and Hauraki. Communities in coastal regions evacuated on Monday. Mandatory evacuations were ordered along the entire eastern Bay of Plenty coastline – an area covering about 400 homes – as well as for 100 homes in the Whakatāne district in the Bay of Plenty region. There were concerns that the high tide – due to arrive around midnight on Monday – would coincide with the worst of the storm. National forecaster MetService said it had broken its record for “red” weather warnings issued around the country, and wind gusts of 150-160km/h were recorded. New Zealand prime minister Chris Hipkins warned the worst is yet to come as Cyclone Gabrielle sparks evacuations, rising flood waters and power outages across the North Island. “Things are likely to get worse before they get better,” Hipkins said. “Extreme weather event has come on the back of extreme weather event.” Hipkins added that the “threshold for a national emergency has not yet been met” as of 4pm on Monday but officials were “getting an update every four hours” and reassessing. The New Zealand government announced a $11.5m community support package to help tens of thousands of people affected by the recent floods as well as to prepare for the response to Cyclone Gabrielle. Air New Zealand cancelled 509 flights with 10,000 international customers affected by the disruptions. Normal services are expected to resume on Tuesday. The cyclone is the second significant weather event to hit Auckland and the upper North Island in just a few weeks. Last month Auckland and surrounding areas were hit by record rainfall that sparked floods and killed four people. A landslide crashed into a home in a coastal Coromandel Peninsula town, forcing its occupants to evacuate on Monday afternoon. Fire and emergency crews were alerted to the large slip in Hahei at 4.18pm on Monday, local news outlet Stuff reported. “From the information we can see, everyone is out of the house and a small number of people in the area are being evacuated,” a spokesperson said. “That’s as much detail as we can provide.” A “record storm surge” has been recorded in Whitianga, in the Waikato region of New Zealand’s North Island. The Whitianga monitoring station recorded a storm surge of 0.7 metres and rising, according to the Niwa forecast service. The surge measures the rise in water level above the normal tidal level. Rain engulfs North Island Radar images released by MetService show rain engulfing New Zealand’s North Island on Monday afternoon. Eight North Island regions have now declared states of emergency. Here are some of the latest images to come through our news wires this afternoon. Here Hauraki and Ōpōtiki have also announced local states of emergency – that’s most of the upper North Island now covered. At his 4pm press conference, prime minister Chris Hipkins said the “threshold for a national emergency has not yet been met” but officials were “getting an update every four hours” and reassessing. Waikato District Council has declared a local state of emergency, saying a number of areas around the Waikato River were now at high risk of flooding. At least five other North Island regions – Auckland, Whakatāne, Northland, Coromandel and Tairāwhiti – have declared local states of emergency, which allow councils special powers, including to conduct emergency evacuations. “With the worst of the weather due to hit overnight, we want to ensure that we are ready to respond taking whatever action necessary to keep our people safe,” said the Waikato District Council mayor, Jacqui Church. She also told residents to self-evacuate if their area was flooding. If there is surface flooding in your area and you see rising water, do not wait for official warnings. Head for higher ground and stay away from flood water. Storm reflects global importance of tackling climate crisis, Hipkins says The prime minister says that he’ll likely discuss recent weather emergencies in upcoming meetings with other world leaders – and that the storms illustrate the “global importance” of tackling climate change. I think we’re certainly bound to be asked about the weather in my discussions with other leaders... I’ll be sharing New Zealand’s experience and of course, it is an illustration of the global importance of tackling the challenge of climate change. Other countries are experiencing more extreme weather events as well – the globe is increasingly seeing the effects of climate change. Hipkins has spent some time discussing the government’s $11.5m in extra funding for cyclone relief. “It’s clear the demand for support is exceeding the funding available,” he said. “Extreme weather event has come on the back of extreme weather event. “Things are likely to get worse before they get better.” The prime minister, Chris Hipkins, is speaking to media now from Auckland. He says 25,000 people have so far been assisted with food, clothing, shelter, bedding and accommodation. “People have lost their homes and their vehicles, families are facing additional challenges getting children back to school. And many families will be facing anxiety and distress,” he said. The New Zealand government has just announced a $11.5m community support package to help tens of thousands of people affected by the recent floods as well as to prepare for the response to Cyclone Gabrielle. The minister for social development and employment, Carmel Sepuloni, said that the demand for support is exceeding funding available for community organisations and groups. Under the proposed support package, $4m will be given to providers to ensure they can “meet increased demand and support [the] wellbeing of their staff and volunteers” as well as $1m to replenish stocks at food banks currently experiencing high demand, according to a ministry statement shared with the Guardian. Another $2m of grants will be provided for community groups to support flood response and a $4m expansion of the scope of community connectors to support Auckland and impacted regions’ flood response efforts. A $500,000 ring fenced funding will also be included to respond to the needs of disabled people. Sepuloni said: This support package will provide immediate relief for individuals and families, bespoke support for disabled people like transport assistance, as well as support for the voluntary sector who continue to be at the heart of their communities and our response.” Sepuloni added that although “we’re not out of the woods yet” and the full extent of the damage was still unfolding, he said authorities needed to act swiftly to ensure people can continue to access support. “Our focus remains on the most affected communities including Māori, Pacific, disabled, youth and our ethnic communities, and the organisations and groups that work to support them,” he added. A mandatory evacuation order is currently in place for about 100 homes in the Whakatāne district in the Bay of Plenty region, which just declared a local state of emergency at 3pm on Monday. Acting mayor Lesley Immink said the declaration provides additional emergency management powers to the district controller and enables the civil defence response to call on support from outside the district if required. Emergency management powers allows our response team to do things like close off areas, evacuate people and get the resources needed to respond to this event. Auckland airport has also released an update, advising that there have been “significant flight cancellations” today. A total of 85 out of 104 scheduled international flights have been cancelled together with all 301 scheduled domestic flights, the airport said. Cyclone Gabrielle is approaching New Zealand’s North Island as more challenging conditions are set to come. Our video team has gathered some of the footage from the past few hours. The weather has also wreaked havoc on New Zealand’s travel network, with flights, trains and bus schedules all badly affected. Air New Zealand said they had so far cancelled 509 flights, but normal services were expected to resume on Tuesday. The airline said 10,000 international customers were disrupted, with 6,500 left to be rebooked. “With over 500 flight cancellations impacting more than 29,000 customers, we’re doing everything we can to get those disrupted back into the skies as quickly as possible,” the airline said in a statement on Monday afternoon. Thousands of homes in New Zealand are currently without power and flights have been grounded. Emergency management minister Kieran McAnulty said it would be a “critical day” due to the “highly dangerous” combination of high winds and heavy rain. Although the storm has weakened from its previous cyclone status, it has already toppled trees, damaged roads and downed power lines. A state of emergency has been declared in five northern regions including Auckland. Some 58,000 people in New Zealand’s North Island are without power. Officials warn it could take days to restore the network. “As long as the weather continues to be as severe as it is, it’s actually unsafe” to work on the network, McAnulty said. Another quick snap here from MetService showing strong winds expected across the majority of the country. In northern New Zealand, some of the highest gusts have been recorded. The forecaster recorded winds of up to 163km/h at Channel Island and 144 km/h at Mokohinau Island. National forecaster MetService has issued a heavy rain warning, together with a red and strong wind warning predicted to last until Wednesday. Wind gusts of 150-160 km/h, and some stations in Gisborne have recorded rain rates of 15-30mm in a single hour, the forecaster said. Wind gusts also reached up to 140km/h in Northland and 135km/h in the Hauraki Gulf, outside Auckland. These winds are expected to produce widespread damage, especially to trees and power lines and could lift roofs. Transport and power networks are likely to be significantly impacted, with road closures and power outages. Conditions will be hazardous for motorists and there is a danger to life from flying debris and falling trees or branches. Emergency services log 198 weather-related incidents Fire and Emergency New Zealand district manager Brad Mosby has also provided an update, saying that said over the past 12 hours, from 1am, there had been 198 incidents logged related to severe weather. Most have been related to wind damage, he added. There were 91 incidents recorded in Northland, 62 in Auckland and 35 in Waikato, mainly from the Coromandel. As rain intensifies, more calls relating to flooding are coming through, Moseby said. Worst of wind to batter parts of Auckland on Tuesday MetService meteorologist Georgina Griffiths has said the cyclone is about halfway through and the most challenging wind conditions are set to batter parts of Auckland on Tuesday. Griffiths said rainfall has made the ground soggy again, however no major flooding has happened yet. We do not expect everyone to see the heavier rain rates, however those who do will see localised impacts such as slips and floods. The wind is expected to return from the south-west overnight and tomorrow. A storm surge is still likely for eastern Auckland around 2am, however effects will be less than previously expected, Griffiths said. ‘We’re not out of the woods yet,’ Auckland residents warned Rachel Kelleher, deputy controller Auckland emergency management, has said the effects of the cyclone will get worse before they get better. “We’re not out of the woods yet,” she told reporters during a live briefing on Monday. Auckland residents urged to stay home The mayor of Auckland, Wayne Brown, has said the next 24 hours will be challenging, urging residents to stay home. As long as it’s safe, stay home … It’s going to be a hard night and a very difficult week. For many, the recovery will be long.” Officials are gathering to provide a live update on Cyclone Gabrielle in Auckland today. Representatives from the MetService, Auckland council, the NZDF, fire and emergency and other organisations are joining Auckland emergency management at 2pm local time. Speaking are Georgina Griffiths from MetService, Colonel Mel Childs from the defence force, fire and emergency district manager Brad Mosby, Vector’s chief operating officer Peter Ryan, Auckland mayor Wayne Brown and Auckland transport’s general manager of safety, Stacey van der Putten. We will bring you all the latest lines shortly. Defence force on standby The New Zealand defence force has located 150 staff across Auckland and neighbouring regions as they bring in welfare supplies to civil defence centres and shelters. A statement issued by the force on Monday morning read: About 150 NZDF personnel and mix of vehicle types are positioned ready to respond across the Northland, Auckland, Coromandel and Bay of Plenty areas. Teams have also been assisting in the establishment of Civil Defence centres and shelters across Auckland including delivering more than 50 pallets of emergency supplies including blankets, tea, coffee, air mattresses, sleeping bags and warm clothes. Rain and wind expected to intensify The approach of Cyclone Gabrielle is bringing particularly strong winds, heavy rain and huge swells to Auckland and nearby regions. Gabrielle is now sitting just north of New Zealand, with weather forecasters expecting rain and winds to intensify as it nears land during Monday and Tuesday. Rachel Kelleher, deputy controller Auckland emergency management, warned that the cyclone was “still in its early stages” and more severe weather is to come. The impact of Gabrielle is still in its early stages and further serious and severe weather is still expected for Tāmaki Makaurau (Auckland) later today into Tuesday morning. Now is not the time for complacency. Person missing on boat off Great Barrier Island A search is under way to for a person missing on a boat off the coast of Great Barrier Island. A police spokesperson said police had responded to reports of a boat in distress around 2.15am. “Enquiries are ongoing to locate one person aboard a water vessel near Great Barrier Island this morning.” The Police Maritime and Eagle – helicopter response – units had “attempted to approach the boat throughout the morning, however conditions have been challenging, and at this stage no one has been located,” they said. Police will make further attempts to approach the vessel when conditions allow. Chris Hipkins may miss opening of parliament Prime minister Chris Hipkins may miss the scheduled opening of parliament tomorrow if he remains trapped in Auckland by Cyclone Gabrielle. Hipkins traveled to Auckland to attend cyclone preparation briefings and speak to Apec business council. With all domestic flights in and out of Auckland currently cancelled until at least midday tomorrow, the prime minister’s chances of getting back to parliament to deliver the prime minister’s statement – traditional on the first house sitting of the year – are looking narrow. Cellphone service disrupted by storm As well as power outages, there are disruptions to cellphone coverage – primarily in the upper North Island – with some cell phone sites out due to power outages or wind damage. Vodafone, Spark and 2 Degrees all say they have a number of sites down. Forecasters and weather monitoring agencies are forecasting huge swells around the North Island – and warning people to stay away. National forecaster Metservice says the worst weather is still to come – and that it has already broken records for the most “red” weather warnings ever issued. Some of the key points from their statement at noon: Cyclone Gabrielle is bearing down on the North Island, and despite widespread damage and disruption last night and this morning, the worst weather is still to come for many regions today. “This is a major weather system and shouldn’t be taken lightly,” explains meteorologist Angus Hines. “We have a couple more days of wild weather ahead. We’ve never had such an extensive range of Red Severe Weather Warnings – which are the highest classification of Severe Weather Warning MetService can issue.” Many of the red rain warnings are for already waterlogged regions, following last month’s floods. Those warnings are currently in place for Northland, Auckland, the Coromandel Peninsula and the north of Tairāwhiti/Gisborne. Angus says: All of these places have already dealt with immense rainfall this year, and lots of them are in clean-up mode from recent flooding. Unfortunately, we expect further flooding, slips power outages, and road closures Monday and Tuesday, prolonging this unprecedented wet summer. Evacuations advised in some low-lying, coastal communities Evacuations are under way in some coastal, low-lying and river-adjacent communities. In Whangarei, the district council has advised residents living close to rivers in the central business district and Town Basin area to evacuate before high tide at 1.56pm, “because of a high risk of coastal flooding”. An evacuation centre has opened at McKay Stadium. Elsewhere around the North Island, some communities have been self-evacuating, but officials don’t yet have data on how many. At an 11am press conference, emergency management official Roger Ball said there was no precise number of evacuations at that point. Twenty-four Civil Defence centres and shelters opened up in Auckland overnight, including three mass evacuation centres. New Zealanders are advised to check with their local Civil Defence for details on evacuations. Cyclone tracking southward So far the centre of the cyclone is sitting just north of New Zealand, and moving slowly southward. Here’s a satellite image from an hour ago: You can track the cyclone via satellite in real time via Metservice. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Cyclone Gabrielle. I’m Tess McClure, I’m based in Auckland, and I will be keeping you up to date on developments as they come in. Here is what we know so far: 58,000 homes in the North Island are without power, and some in the Northland region may not have it restored for around a week. Auckland, Northland, Coromandel and the Tairāwhiti region have declared states of emergency. As of 11am, government officials said they were assessing every four hours whether a national state of emergency would be declared. Evacuations have begun in some low-lying and coastal communities. The cyclone has not yet made landfall, and the worst of the storm’s effects are yet to arrive, emergency management minister Kieran McAnulty said on Monday morning: “Today is the critical day in the event with a highly dangerous combination of high winds and heavy rain.” National forecaster MetService has issued 30 weather warnings nationwide, with “red” weather and rain warnings for Auckland and Northland. Wind gusts have reaches up to 140km/h in Northland and 135km/h in the Hauraki Gulf, outside Auckland. Auckland residents have been urged to stay home and ensure they have supplies for up to three days. Most Auckland flights and all trains are cancelled and almost every school is shut. The cyclone comes a fortnight after devastating floods in Auckland and around the North Island, which killed four, damaged thousands of homes and left 370 households still in emergency accommodation. The severe winds and rain would come on top of already sodden land, risking structural problems, landslips, falling trees and power line problems. The whole Auckland region was at risk of flooding, emergency management officials said on Monday. Minister urges people urged to hunker down Emergency management minister Kieran McAnulty has just finished up a briefing in Auckland, urging people to finalise their preparations and then hunker down. “To those where the weather hasn’t hit but it’s projected to, please use the time that you’ve got to get prepared. As we’ve seen in those areas that have now been hit, using that time to get prepared can make all the difference.” Some supermarkets have run out of high-demand items, but he said those shortages would be temporary, and told people to resist panic buying. “We’re encouraging people to … only get what they need. In an event like this three days should be enough.” He ended by urging against unnecessary risk-taking – including surfers who could be tempted by huge swells. Please don’t go out in the flood water, please don’t go out in the high swells. We’re seeing reports and projections that some of the swells around coastal New Zealand are going to be absolutely massive – look, I’m conscious that some people might find that appealing and they might want to go surfing or whatever … please don’t do something that if you get caught will drag emergency responders away from their core task."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/dec/04/anecdotal-evidence-has-power-change-minds-facts-are-paramount","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-04T09:30:09Z","webTitle":"Anecdotal evidence has the power to change minds but facts are paramount | Torsten Bell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/04/anecdotal-evidence-has-power-change-minds-facts-are-paramount","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/04/anecdotal-evidence-has-power-change-minds-facts-are-paramount","fields":{"bodyText":"Welcoming good news is easy but it’s important to face up to bad news too, either to overcome it or quickly lower your expectations of life in line with it. On the face of it, beneath an encouraging headline, there’s some crushingly bad news for those of us working on rigorous, evidence-heavy research in a recent study that investigates which information changes the minds of people on the role of international aid spending, the efficacy of which many are sceptical about. The latter point in part explains why many countries are theoretically signed up to spending 0.7% of GDP on aid but most are doing no such thing. The chancellor’s autumn statement confirmed there was no imminent prospect of the UK returning to doing so. The researchers conducted an experiment to evaluate the impact of telling people (specifically 6,000 Germans) that an aid programme worked, by measuring its effect on their belief in aid effectiveness. The good news is that this was positive, raising average support by more than 10%. But, crucially, they also examined whether that impact is greater if it is backed up by different kinds of evidence: a serious chart illustrating the results of a scientific evaluation of the programme or a simple anecdote of someone who benefited endorsing the programme. Which kind of evidence had the biggest effect in boosting public support? The words no social scientist wants to read are: “anecdotal evidence performs best”. But all is not lost. After all, while some politicians may only worry about what convinces the public that they are right, researchers are also interested in what the truth is in the first place. And there evidence trumps anecdote every time. • Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.

Asked about the implications for Taiwan, he said: “We must collaborate with our allies and like-minded countries, and never tolerate a unilateral attempt to change the status quo by the use of force in the Indo-Pacific, especially in east Asia.” He added: “Russia’s egregious aggression against Ukraine is a clear violation of international law, which prohibits the use of force against a nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Earlier, Johnson said: “We in the UK recognise that our security in Europe is indivisible from the security, our collective security, in the Asia-Pacific, in the Indo-Pacific region. “And there is direct read across from the actions of autocratic, coercive powers in Europe, to what may happen in east Asia.” The two countries have signed a mutual access agreement for their two forces, in part dedicated to keep the seas free and open. Kishida also announced new sanctions, including an asset freeze on 140 Russian individuals and the expansion of an export ban to include Russian military firms. The package was announced the day after Russia imposed asset bans and travel freezes on 60 Japanese officials, including Japanese cabinet members and the prime minister himself. Kishida had described the Russian action as completely unacceptable. Kishida’s ruling Liberal Democratic party has recently proposed a substantial increase in defence spending – possibly to an amount on a par with 2% of gross domestic product, up from the current 1% – and the development of the capacity to attack missile-launching sites in an enemy’s territory. He said that, in the wake of the Russian invasion, he was trying to instil a crisis mentality in the Japanese people. Facing elections in July and rising energy prices that are squeezing voters’ budgets, Kishida said nuclear power would form a bigger part of the country’s future energy policy mix. He said Japan would address the “vulnerability of our own energy self-sufficiency” by broadening where it buys energy from, promoting renewables and using nuclear power to diversify its sources of generation. Japan has become more reliant on Russian gas since shutting down nuclear reactors after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, in which an earthquake and tsunami triggered a meltdown, devastating its north-eastern region. The country is reluctant to impose a total ban on Russian oil imports. Kishida’s visit to London was the conclusion of a major trip that saw him visit Asean members Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. Japan is chair of the G7 next year and Kishida is trying to rally east Asia into accepting that Russia’s actions, born of authoritarianism, represent a threat to stability, and that, by extension, the region may have to resist China. Many countries in the region would prefer not to take sides in a contest between China and the US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/08/ukraine-head-of-occupied-zaporizhzhia-plans-referendum-on-joining-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-08T15:33:51Z","webTitle":"Ukraine: head of occupied Zaporizhzhia plans referendum on joining Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/08/ukraine-head-of-occupied-zaporizhzhia-plans-referendum-on-joining-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/08/ukraine-head-of-occupied-zaporizhzhia-plans-referendum-on-joining-russia","fields":{"bodyText":"The Russian-installed head of the occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region signed a decree on Monday providing for a referendum on joining Russia, in the latest sign that Moscow is moving ahead with its plans to annex seized Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has ruled out any peace talks with Russia if the country proceeds with referendums in the occupied areas. Yevgeny Balitsky, the head of the pro-Russia administration in the region, announced the decision to kickstart the process during a pro-Moscow forum entitled “We are with Russia” organised in Melitopol, the largest city controlled by Russia in Zaporizhzhia. “I am signing the order for the central election committee to start the preparations for holding a referendum on the reunification of the Zaporizhzhia region with the Russian Federation,” Balitsky said. Roughly two-thirds of Zaporizhzhia is under Russian occupation, part of a swathe of southern Ukraine that Moscow captured early in the war, including most of the neighbouring Kherson region, where Russian officials have also discussed plans for a referendum. Russia-appointed officials in Zaporizhzhia earlier said that the administration planned to proceed with a referendum even if Russia did not gain control over the entire region. Zaporizhzhia city is still held by Ukraine. Ukraine and its western allies have said that any referendums held under Russian occupation would be illegal and their results fraudulent. In 2014, Moscow and its proxies carried out a widely condemned referendum in Crimea, weeks after its forces seized the peninsula. On Sunday, Zelenskiy said peace talks with Russia would be impossible if the country proceeded with such votes in the occupied areas. “Our country’s position remains what it always has been. We will give up nothing of what is ours,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly address to the nation. “If the occupiers proceed along the path of pseudo-referendums they will close for themselves any chance of talks with Ukraine and the free world, which the Russian side will clearly need at some point. Balitsky on Monday gave no further details about the timing of the referendum. Bloomberg, citing two unnamed sources familiar with Moscow’s strategy, earlier reported that the Kremlin was aiming to conduct the referendums by 15 September. Kremlin-appointed officials in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia had already instigated a number of measures aimed at bringing the occupied regions closer to Russia and setting the stage for a future referendum. Earlier this summer, the Russian occupation authorities had started to hand out Russian passports to locals in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Moscow has also forced Ukrainian teachers in occupied territories to follow the Russian curriculum, while “We are with Russia” billboards have sprung up across occupied cities. In a move further signalling Moscow’s intentions, the pro-Russian authorities in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia have set up local “elections committees” that are to be responsible for running the referendums. President Vladimir Putin initially denied that Moscow was seeking to occupy new land when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. However, he has since made a string of statements in which he sought to justify what he portrayed as Russia’s historic quests to win back Russian lands. Last month, Russia’s minister of foreign affairs, Sergei Lavrov, said that Moscow had expanded its war aims in Ukraine, saying they now extended to Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The Kremlin has also repeatedly hinted that it would recognise the referendums held in the seized Ukrainian territories, which would present the opportunity for Putin to declare the conquered areas as Russian territory. Ukraine, boosted by western weapons, has vowed to mount a major counteroffensive in the country’s south. However, the annexation of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia could complicate Ukraine’s attempts to recapture the areas: if annexed by Moscow, the territories would be protected by the country’s nuclear arsenal. Speaking to the BBC on Monday, the retired British general Sir Richard Barrons said that a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive launched in the southern regions annexed by Moscow would raise the prospect of Russia using “small nuclear weapons”. “Ukraine would now be pushing into territory that Russia has declared as Russia, and at that point doctrinally and probably politically, Russia will start to reach for its tactical, its small nuclear weapons,” Barrons said, adding that those weapons would have a radius of “roughly two miles”. “We need to think through that and not regard it as some sort of terrible surprise that is completely unthinkable,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/10/nuclear-disarmament-activists-putin-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-10T10:00:02Z","webTitle":"Fresh effort to ban the bomb as new generation bids for nuclear-free world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/10/nuclear-disarmament-activists-putin-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/10/nuclear-disarmament-activists-putin-ukraine","fields":{"bodyText":"As nuclear dangers gather momentum three decades after the cold war, a disarmament movement is rising to meet them, with a new generation of activists. In the late 50s and early 60s, and then again in the early 80s, when the US and the Soviet Union were pointing their missiles at each other in Europe, there were mass street protests against governments making plans for global annihilation. The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) was born in the UK and staged large-scale marches to the heart of the British nuclear weapons establishment at Aldermaston. More than four decades ago, a million Americans converged on New York’s Central Park to call a halt to the arms race and a nuclear freeze. At the end of 1982, more than 30,000 women formed a human chain around the Greenham Common air force base as an act of resistance to the deployment of US cruise missiles there. In October 1983, CND staged the biggest march through London the city had ever seen. With Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and his repeated threats that he would use nuclear weapons if his regime felt in peril, the danger is every bit as real as it was during the Cuban missile crisis or the missile standoff in Europe. This time, there have not been any mass protests but there has been a popular response that has found other channels to express itself. At the vanguard of the new movement is the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican), which successfully canvassed support for a Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) at the UN general assembly, leading to its adoption in 2017. Since then, more than 90 countries have signed the treaty and 68 have ratified it. It has not stopped the US and Russia from upgrading their arsenals and China from pursuing plans to become a third leading nuclear weapons power, but Beatrice Fihn, Ican’s executive director, said the ultimate aim was something more enduring: the delegitimization of nuclear weapons around the world. “It makes it harder to see what is happening as you’re maybe not seeing so many people out on the streets,” said Fihn, who accepted the 2017 Nobel peace prize on Ican’s behalf. But she added: “The movement is very much here, and we’re definitely growing and building.” While continuing the work of CND and the nuclear freeze movement, Ican and its 652 partner organisations around the world are seeking inspiration from other forms of civil society action, including the campaigns to ban landmines and cluster munitions, which sought to lay down new norms, and redraw the red lines of what is acceptable on the international stage. “We’re trying to undo the brainwashing of accepting nuclear weapons as normal,” Fihn said. The movement’s greatest source of leverage, she argued, was the need of nuclear weapons for legitimacy. “We see that with Russia right now. They’re fighting hard to re-establish legitimacy around the nuclear weapons and their security council seat and around the narrative of this war. And to me, it’s a sign that they are vulnerable.” Kate Hudson, CND’s general secretary, says new membership has surged since Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine was unleashed. “Activism is there in a big way, but it’s taking new forms, and it’s more fluid than previously: the way people understand and act on the links between issues, politically and in campaigning terms,” Hudson said. The nuclear disarmament movement is no longer in a silo of its own, she argued, as it shares common concerns for those fighting to stop climate crisis, or to uphold social justice in a world where governments are spending huge amounts on nuclear stockpiles while the poorest people in their society are cold and hungry. The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement is now framing nuclear disarmament as a social justice issue for many newly recruited activists, making it a far more diverse field. Mari Faines, partner for mobilisation in the Global Zero disarmament advocacy group, said BLM prompted her to see more clearly the “correlation between the systems of policing and militarism”, and the overlap between the nuclear weapons complex, social justice struggles and other existential threats. “I’m hopeful and optimistic that this new wave of young and diverse voices that are stepping into this space are thinking through that,” Faines said. “They’re thinking about diplomatic answers in a different way. They’re reimagining what security could and should look like.” Molly Hurley, who was born in China but was adopted by a white American family, said the nuclear disarmament movement was not quite as open as it thought itself to be. “The nuke space is not the most welcoming for young people, for women of colour, for anyone of colour,” she said. After a few years working for disarmament activist groups, Hurley, who turns 27 in November, has started an arts degree in Baltimore. She still made the trip to a nuclear conference in Washington put on last month by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. She explained: “The issues themselves are things I can’t just stop caring about.” As Russia steps up its aggression in Ukraine, a sense of dread and anxiety has spread among Hurley’s friends. For them, she said, it is just one more existential threat over which they have no control. “One of my friends specifically told me: I am just so overwhelmed by the prospects of the entire world ending due to the decisions of just a few white guys who I will never meet and who will never listen to anything I have to say,” she said. Hurley is experimenting with new ways to talk about geopolitical threats. While working on her art degree, she writes a column on the Inkstick website, and her latest was about what the US and China might learn from the enemies-to-lovers trope in romantic fiction. “You cannot fear-monger your way to a mass movement,” she said, arguing that what has been perceived as apathy within her generation was really a “coping mechanism for hopelessness”. The solution, she argued, was to offer some grounds for hope. “There are things that we can do and we need to make clear all these feasible, very concrete steps that can be taken.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/25/three-tory-cheers-for-the-apocalypse-after-liz-truss-nuclear-pledge","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-25T17:03:40Z","webTitle":"Three Tory cheers for the apocalypse after Liz Truss’s nuclear pledge | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/25/three-tory-cheers-for-the-apocalypse-after-liz-truss-nuclear-pledge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/25/three-tory-cheers-for-the-apocalypse-after-liz-truss-nuclear-pledge","fields":{"bodyText":"What a thoughtful, enlightened piece by Jacinda Ardern (The world stands on a nuclear precipice – we must avoid catastrophe, 25 August), in such contrast to the words of our wannabe prime minister Liz Truss, who said this week that she would be ready to use nuclear weapons even though it would mean global annihilation (cue applause from Tory party members).

Two. That number alone puts in stark perspective the world’s current arsenal of about 13,000 nuclear weapons. And yet in many ways the 13,000 weapons held globally represents progress; it’s less than a quarter of the more than 63,000 weapons in circulation in 1985 during the cold war. But what John F Kennedy said in 1961 at the United Nations is as urgent now as it ever was: “We must abolish these weapons before they abolish us.” Over the more than 50 years since the inception of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty it’s played an important role in lowering the risk of these weapons abolishing us. In addition to the near 80% reduction in nuclear weapons, the treaty has also contributed to keeping a lid on the number of countries acquiring them. More countries have ratified the treaty than any other arms limitation and disarmament agreement. Right now in New York, there is an opportunity to go even further. And we must. Our world is at greater risk of nuclear catastrophe than at any time since the height of the cold war. Growing superpower tensions and two decades of stalled progress on arms control have pushed the risk of these weapons closer to reality. Currently 191 countries are meeting at the UN to renew the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and negotiations are going down to the wire. These talks offer a chance to breathe new life into nuclear disarmament at a time when the world needs that more than ever. Nuclear catastrophe is not an abstract threat but a real world risk. Nuclear weapons could be deployed in a conflict, as Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has intimated, or they could be deployed by miscalculation or mistake – real possibilities in times of heightened tension. New Zealand is calling on the nuclear weapons states – the US, Russia, China, France and the UK – to step back from the nuclear abyss, and provide that leadership by committing to negotiate a new multilateral nuclear disarmament framework. But from one of the best geographical positions in the world to be should nuclear fallout occur, why does New Zealand feel so strongly about this issue? We are a Pacific nation. Our region bears the scars of decades of nuclear testing, on both the people and the lands and waters of our region. That’s why for 35 years New Zealand has been proudly nuclear-free and an international advocate for a world free of nuclear weapons. This does not mean we are naive to real world dynamics, nor does our geographic location mean we have the luxury of a moral stance that others do not. In fact, New Zealand’s message – that nuclear weapons do not make anyone safer and no longer have a place in our world – reflects the view of the overwhelming majority of countries. We just need to believe a different approach is possible. We only have to look back in our history to map a path to a safer future. The lessons of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and of testing in the Pacific, are reminder enough that there is never justification for the deployment of nuclear weapons. The challenges of agreeing multilateral nuclear disarmament can seem overwhelming. But it’s not a task that can be put off indefinitely. Right now, the treaty is under stress. It is affected by geopolitical developments including tension between the nuclear weapon states. But, more fundamentally, there is growing scepticism and frustration about the intention of the nuclear weapon states to ever fully implement their nuclear disarmament commitments under the treaty, with those states arguing the global security environment makes doing so too difficult. If this continues, there is a real prospect of countries losing faith in the treaty – putting at risk both the treaty’s role in progressing nuclear disarmament, and in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons material. There is a lot at stake in New York this week. Some might say that in the current global environment a new nuclear arms race is inevitable, and with it a further undermining of our nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. But I cannot accept a logic that suggests insecurity and instability render us incapable of doing the very thing that would help make the world less insecure and less unstable – an idea that the history of the treaty itself shows is false. There can and should be a different trajectory – one of urgent leadership, of recognition of the nuclear precipice on which we are all standing, and of continued progress in our efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons.

Right? Yet the Federal Reserve, corporate economists and the Republican party have turned the goal upside down – into fewer jobs and lower wages. Otherwise, they say, we’ll face more inflation. Rubbish. This upside-down logic is pushing the United States economy toward a recession, which could hit about the same time as the next presidential election – which will make Joe Biden a one-term president, just as Fed-induced recessions made Jimmy Carter and George HW Bush one-term presidents. None of this is necessary. The Fed has raised borrowing costs at 10 consecutive meetings, pushing its benchmark rate to over 5%. Yet inflation has barely budged. In April, it dropped to 4.9% (year-over-year) from 5% in March – according to Wednesday’s Labor Bureau data. Why are the Fed’s rate hikes having so little effect? Because inflation is not being propelled by an overheated economy. It’s being propelled by overheated profits. Wage gains still lag behind price increases. Average hourly earnings grew by just 0.3% in March, with year-over-year growth of only 4.2%. Wages and salaries in the Employment Cost Index, a broader measure of worker compensation, have been trending downward for a year. Supply chains have returned to normal. Freight-trucking prices peaked in spring 2022 and since then have tumbled close to pre-pandemic levels. In March, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s global supply-chain-pressure index fell to its lowest level since 2008, and it has been dropping since December 2021. Prices for raw goods have also dropped from mid-2022 highs. Meanwhile, consumers have used up whatever extra money they accumulated during the pandemic. So, what’s causing inflation? Corporations with enough monopoly power to raise their prices and fatten their profits – which the Fed’s rate hikes barely affect. Even the Wall Street Journal (in a lead article last week headlined “Why Is Inflation So Sticky? It Could Be Corporate Profits”) spotlights corporations boosting profit margins. Corporate profit margins were around 10% in 2019. Last year, they reached over 15% – their highest level since 1950 – rising 6.6% year over year. By the end of 2022, profits were still near 14%. Prices remain sky-high because corporations got hooked on price-gouging and won’t give it up. Corporate economists argue that businesses couldn’t possibly be padding their profits; if they could, they would have done it before the inflation of the last two years. Baloney. Businesses have been using the cover of inflation to justify price increases, so consumers accept them. According to Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, businesses are betting that consumers will go along with the price hikes because they assume prices are being driven by supply bottlenecks and higher energy prices. Corporations “are confident that they can convince consumers that it isn’t their fault, and it won’t damage their brand”. Last month, Procter &amp; Gamble said in an earnings call that it had boosted its profit margins in the first three months of the year by raising its prices. Last Thursday, Budweiser-owner Anheuser-Busch reported a jump in profit margins for the first quarter by raising its prices. Chipotle’s chief financial and administrative officer, Jack Hartung, said in the firm’s first-quarter earnings call that menu prices have risen by about 10%, and chairman and CEO Brian Niccol said they were “staying the course” on pricing – despite the fact profits were up 17% for the quarter. “We’re in a really strong position that when we’re ready and we believe it’s necessary to pull that pricing lever, we can.” Big corporations have enough monopoly power to raise prices. With just a handful of companies dominating each market, it’s easy to implicitly agree they’ll all raise their prices. What to do about this? Put the burden of fighting inflation on corporations rather than on workers and consumers. Instead of relying on the Fed to “tame” inflation via fewer jobs and lower wages, Congress should pass legislation that: – Allows the justice department to bust up monopolies (and prevent further consolidation through mergers and acquisitions) when three or fewer corporations have more than half the sales of a particular market. – Directs the Federal Trade Commission to find that any such corporation has engaged in unlawful price gouging whenever it has raised prices higher than the rate of inflation and impose a fine that would claw back those unlawful gains. – Permits the treasury department to impose a windfall profits tax on large corporations, above a specific reasonable rate of return or profit margin. Republicans won’t go along with any of this, of course. Which presents Biden and the Democrats with a clear opportunity. Make this a major campaign theme for 2024. Ask the public: do you want more jobs and higher wages, or do you want large corporations making fatter profits by raising prices?

Two units at EDF’s West Burton A plant in Nottinghamshire began producing power for the grid on Tuesday afternoon. Their output will be ramped up depending on how much electricity can be generated from other sources. The Met Office has issued weather warnings for rain and snow across the UK, with temperatures of -4C expected in London and -6C in Birmingham. A combination of freezing temperatures pushing up demand for power and heating, and low wind cutting windfarm electricity generation have made generation conditions tight. Strikes at EDF’s nuclear power plants in France, which supply Britain with electricity via subsea cables, have also raised concerns in recent days. The Nottinghamshire units are two of five covered by winter contingency contracts negotiated last year by the government to keep coal-fired power plants on standby for emergency use amid heightened concerns over power supplies this winter. The coal-fired plants, which also include units at Drax in Yorkshire and at Uniper’s Ratcliffe-on-Soar plant in Nottinghamshire, have been warmed for potential use several times this winter but stood down each time. The Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO) has also asked two units at Drax in Yorkshire to warm up for potential use. Separately, ESO issued an electricity margin notice, telling the owners of all power plants to bring on extra power supplies between 4.30pm and 8.30pm on Tuesday. It later cancelled this requirement. National Grid stressed its measures to bolster supplies did not mean supplies were at risk. However, the ESO stopped short of paying consumers and businesses to turn down their energy use. Earlier on Tuesday, it issued a notice that it may employ its demand flexibility service on Wednesday but later said it would not run. The Grid has been on alert over risks of potential power cuts this winter because of concerns Russia would cut gas supplies into Europe, with a knock-on effect in Britain. However, a relatively mild winter and high levels of gas storage in Europe have eased these fears, and caused gas prices to fall sharply. A spokesperson for the ESO said that the coal units would offer “additional contingency to operate the network as normal”. In December, National Grid paid record amounts to encourage gas-fired power plants to crank up supply at short notice. Experts expected it to pay high prices to gas-fired plants again on Tuesday. Live ESO data showed gas-fired plants accounted for 54% of Great Britain’s electricity generation, with windfarms contributing 13% and nuclear 10%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2022/nov/20/sam-bankman-fried-longtermism-effective-altruism-future-fund","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-20T11:00:25Z","webTitle":"Power-hungry robots, space colonization, cyborgs: inside the bizarre world of ‘longtermism’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/20/sam-bankman-fried-longtermism-effective-altruism-future-fund","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2022/nov/20/sam-bankman-fried-longtermism-effective-altruism-future-fund","fields":{"bodyText":"Most of us don’t think of power-hungry killer robots as an imminent threat to humanity, especially when poverty and the climate crisis are already ravaging the Earth. This wasn’t the case for Sam Bankman-Fried and his followers, powerful actors who have embraced a school of thought within the effective altruism movement called “longtermism”. In February, the Future Fund, a philanthropic organization endowed by the now-disgraced cryptocurrency entrepreneur, announced that it would be disbursing more than $100m – and possibly up to $1bn – this year on projects to “improve humanity’s long-term prospects”. The slightly cryptic reference might have been a bit puzzling to those who think of philanthropy as funding homelessness charities and medical NGOs in the developing world. In fact, the Future Fund’s particular areas of interest include artificial intelligence, biological weapons and “space governance”, a mysterious term referring to settling humans in space as a potential “watershed moment in human history”. Out-of-control artificial intelligence was another area of concern for Bankman-Fried – so much so that in September the Future Fund announced prizes of up to $1.5m to anyone who could make a persuasive estimate of the threat that unrestrained AI might pose to humanity. “We think artificial intelligence” is “the development most likely to dramatically alter the trajectory of humanity this century”, the Future Fund said. “With the help of advanced AI, we could make enormous progress toward ending global poverty, animal suffering, early death and debilitating disease.” But AI could also “acquire undesirable objectives and pursue power in unintended ways, causing humans to lose all or most of their influence over the future”. Less than two months after the contest was announced, Bankman-Fried’s $32bn cryptocurrency empire had collapsed, much of the Future Fund’s senior leadership had resigned and its AI prizes may never be rewarded. Nor will most of the millions of dollars that Bankman-Fried had promised a constellation of charities and thinktanks affiliated with effective altruism, a once-obscure ethical movement that has become influential in Silicon Valley and the highest echelons of the international business and political worlds. ••• Longtermists argue that the welfare of future humans is as morally important – or more important – than the lives of current ones, and that philanthropic resources should be allocated to predicting, and defending against, extinction-level threats to humanity. But rather than giving out malaria nets or digging wells, longtermists prefer to allocate money to researching existential risk, or “x-risk”. In his recent book What We Owe the Future, William MacAskill – a 35-year-old moral philosopher at Oxford who has become the public intellectual face of effective altruism – makes a case for longtermism with a thought experiment about a hiker who accidentally shatters a glass bottle on a trail. A conscientious person, he holds, would immediately clean up the glass to avoid injuring the next hiker – whether that person comes in a week or in a century. Similarly, MacAskill argues that the number of potential future humans, over many generations for the duration of the species, far outnumbers the number currently alive; if we truly believe that all humans are equal, protecting future humans is more important than protecting human lives today. Some of longtermists’ funding interests, such as nuclear nonproliferation and vaccine development, are fairly uncontroversial. Others are more outlandish: investing in space colonization, preventing the rise of power-hungry AI, cheating death through “life-extension” technology. A bundle of ideas known as “transhumanism” seeks to upgrade humanity by creating digital versions of humans, “bioengineering” human-machine cyborgs and the like. People like the futurist Ray Kurzweil and his adherents believe that biotechnology will soon “enable a union between humans and genuinely intelligent computers and AI systems”, Robin McKie explained in the Guardian in 2018. “The resulting human-machine mind will become free to roam a universe of its own creation, uploading itself at will onto a ‘suitably powerful computational substrate’,” and thereby creating a kind of immortality. ••• This feverish techno-utopianism distracts funders from pressing problems that already exist here on Earth, said Luke Kemp, a research associate at the University of Cambridge’s Centre for the Study of Existential Risk who describes himself as an “EA-adjacent” critic of effective altruism. Left on the table, he says, are critical and credible threats that are happening right now, such as the climate crisis, natural pandemics and economic inequality. “The things they push tend to be things that Silicon Valley likes,” Kemp said. They’re the kinds of speculative, futurist ideas that tech billionaires find intellectually exciting. “And they almost always focus on technological fixes” to human problems “rather than political or social ones”. There are other objections. For one thing, lavishly expensive, experimental bioengineering would be accessible, especially initially, to “only a tiny sliver of humanity”, Kemp said; it could bring about a future caste system in which inequality is not only economic, but biological. This thinking is also dangerously undemocratic, he argued. “These big decisions about the future of humanity should be decided by humanity. Not by just a couple of white male philosophers at Oxford funded by billionaires. It is literally the most powerful, and least representative, strata of society imposing a particular vision of the future which suits them.” Kemp added: “I don’t think EAs – or at least the EA leadership – care very much about democracy.” In its more dogmatic varieties, he said, longtermism is preoccupied with “rationality, hardcore utilitarianism, a pathological obsession with quantification and neoliberal economics”. Organizations such as 80,000 Hours, a program for early-career professionals, tend to encourage would-be effective altruists into four main areas, Kemp said: AI research, research preparing for human-made pandemics, EA community-building and “global priorities research”, meaning the question of how funding should be allocated. The first two areas, though worthy of study, are “highly speculative”, Kemp said, and the second two are “self-serving”, since they channel money and energy back into the movement. This year, the Future Fund reports having recommended grants to worthy-seeming projects as various as research on “the feasibility of inactivating viruses via electromagnetic radiation” ($140,000); a project connecting children in India with online science, technology, engineering and mathematics education ($200,000); research on “disease-neutralizing therapeutic antibodies” ($1.55m); and research on childhood lead exposure ($400,000). But much of the Future Fund’s largesse seems to have been invested in longtermism itself. It recommended $1.2m to the Global Priorities Institute; $3.9m to the Long Term Future Fund; $2.9m to create a “longtermist coworking office in London”; $3.9m to create a “longtermist coworking space in Berkeley”; $700,000 to the Legal Priorities Project, a “longtermist legal research and field-building organization”; $13.9m to the Centre for Effective Altruism; and $15m to Longview Philanthropy to execute “independent grantmaking on global priorities research, nuclear weapons policy, and other longtermist issues.” Kemp argued that effective altruism and longtermism often seem to be working toward a kind of regulatory capture. “The long-term strategy is getting EAs and EA ideas into places like the Pentagon, the White House, the British government and the UN” to influence public policy, he said. There may be a silver lining in the timing of Bankman-Fried’s downfall. “In a way, it’s good that it happened now rather than later,” Kemp said. “He was planning on spending huge amounts of money on elections. At one stage, he said he was planning to spend up to a billion dollars, which would have made him the biggest donor in US political history. Can you imagine if that amount of money contributed to a Democratic victory – and then turned out to have been based on fraud? In an already fragile and polarized society like the US? That would have been horrendous.” ••• “The main tension to the movement, as I see it, is one that many movements deal with,” said Benjamin Soskis, a historian of philanthropy and a senior research associate at the Urban Institute. “A movement that was primarily fueled by regular people – and their passions, and interests, and different kinds of provenance – attracted a number of very wealthy funders,” and came to be driven by “the funding decisions, and sometimes just the public identities, of people like SBF and Elon Musk and a few others”. (Soskis noted that he has received funding from Open Philanthropy, an EA-affiliated foundation.) Effective altruism put Bankman-Fried, who lived in a luxury compound in the Bahamas, “on a pedestal, as this Corolla-driving, beanbag-sleeping, earning-to-give monk, which was clearly false”, Kemp said. Soskis thinks that effective altruism has a natural appeal to people in tech and finance – who tend to have an analytical and calculating way of thinking about problems – and EA, like all movements, spreads through social and work networks. Effective altruism is also attractive to wealthy people, Soskis believes, because it offers “a way to understand the marginal value of additional dollars”, particularly when talking of “vast sums that can defy comprehension”. The movement’s focus on numbers (“shut up and multiply”) helps hyper-wealthy people understand more concretely what $500m can do philanthropically versus, say, $500,000 or $50,000. One positive outcome, he thinks, is that EA-influenced donors publicly discuss their philanthropic commitments and encourage others to make them. Historically, Americans have tended to regard philanthropy as a private matter. But there’s something “which I think you can’t escape”, Soskis said. Effective altruism “isn’t premised on a strong critique of the way that money has been made. And elements of it were construed as understanding capitalism more generally as a positive force, and through a kind of consequentialist calculus. To some extent, it’s a safer landing spot for folks who want to sequester their philanthropic decisions from a broader political debate about the legitimacy of certain industries or ways of making money.” Kemp said that it is rare to hear EAs, especially longtermists, discuss issues such as democracy and inequality. “Honestly, I think that’s because it is something the donors don’t want us talking about.” Cracking down on tax avoidance, for example, would lead to major donors “losing both power and wealth”. The downfall of Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire, which has jeopardized the Future Fund and countless other longtermist organizations, may be revealing. Longtermists believe that future existential risks to humanity can be accurately calculated – yet, as the economist Tyler Cowen recently pointed out, they couldn’t even predict the existential threat to their own flagship philanthropic organization. There must be “soul-searching”, Soskis said. “Longtermism has a stain on it and I’m not sure when or if it will be fully removed.” “A billionaire is a billionaire,” the journalist Anand Giridharadas wrote recently on Twitter. His 2018 book Winners Take All sharply criticized the idea that private philanthropy will solve human problems. “Stop believing in good billionaires. Start organizing toward a good society.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/mar/29/powerful-storm-more-wind-rain-snow-california-damage","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-29T16:56:35Z","webTitle":"Powerful storm brings more wind, rain and snow to California","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/29/powerful-storm-more-wind-rain-snow-california-damage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/mar/29/powerful-storm-more-wind-rain-snow-california-damage","fields":{"bodyText":"A powerful weather system has brought more wind, rain and snow to California, hitting a state already battered by months of storms. Forecasters said the storm was not as strong as the systems that pounded California all winter, but it was expected to pull a plume of Pacific moisture into the state as it tracked south. Still, heavy snow hit coastal mountains and the Sierra Nevada. Chains were required for vehicles on highways through the mountain region, and a section of US 395 on the eastern side of the range was closed due to snowfall. The Mammoth Mountain ski resort in the Eastern Sierra declared its snowiest season on record after 28in (70cm) of snow since Tuesday afternoon pushed season snowfall totals to 695in (17.6 meters) at its main lodge and 870 inches (22.1 meters) at the summit of the 11,053ft (3,369-meter) peak. Storm impacts were more modest in southern California, where precipitation was expected to decrease through the day. An unexpected series of powerful storms has pounded California since late December. The storms have claimed more than two dozen lives, caused flooding and landslides, and led to widespread damage to farm lands and infrastructure. Crews on Monday tore down a historic pier in Santa Cruz county that was in danger of collapse. The 500ft-long (152-meter) wooden pier at Seacliff State Beach was severely damaged by big surf in January. Built in 1930, the pier connected the beach to SS Palo Alto, a grounded first world war-era steamship known as the “cement ship”. On the positive side, the storms have brought much-needed water to a state that has suffered from a grueling drought. The storms have raised reservoir levels and built an extraordinary Sierra snowpack, a significant source of California’s water. As of Tuesday, the water content of the snowpack was 228% of the 1 April average, a benchmark for its historical peak, according to the state department of water resources. The state’s two largest reservoirs, Shasta and Oroville, have risen above their historical averages to date after being significantly depleted. The turnabout has allowed a rollback of some water use restrictions, although the California governor, Gavin Newsom, has been careful to not declare the drought over. Cities and farmers that rely on the Central Valley Project, the federally managed water system, got a big boost in their allocations on Tuesday. The increase in supply means that many providers of irrigation water supplied by the CVP will see the amount they can draw jump from as little as 35% of their contracted total to 80%. Providers for city and industrial uses will be allowed 100% of their historic use instead of just 75%, the bureau said. In southern California, the Metropolitan Water District is bringing water from the north to fill its huge Diamond Valley Lake, a reservoir that had diminished to 60% of capacity after three years of drought. It is expected to be full again by year’s end. “Nature gave us a lifeline,” the MWD general manager, Adel Hagekhalil, said on Monday as officials watched water pour into the reservoir."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/22/james-blyth-scottish-engineer-wind-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-22T06:00:27Z","webTitle":"The 19th-century engineer who was ahead of his time on wind power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/22/james-blyth-scottish-engineer-wind-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/22/james-blyth-scottish-engineer-wind-power","fields":{"bodyText":"It was 135 years ago that a Scottish engineer, James Blyth, invented the first wind-powered electrical generator.

He proposed installing electric lighting in the main street of the village, but local people thought the electric light to be “the work of the devil”.

For almost half a century, I have reported on scientific issues and no decade has been complete without two or three announcements by scientists claiming their work would soon allow science to recreate the processes that drive the sun. The end result would be the generation of clean, cheap nuclear fusion that would transform our lives. Such announcements have been rare recently, so it gave me a warm glow to realise that standards may be returning to normal. By deploying a set of 192 lasers to bombard pellets of the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium, researchers at the US National Ignition Facility (NIF) in Livermore, California, were able to generate temperatures only found in stars and thermonuclear bombs. The isotopes then fused into helium, releasing excess energy, they reported. It was a milestone event but not a major one, although this did not stop the US government and swaths of the world’s media indulging in a widespread hyping jamboree over the laboratory’s accomplishment. Researchers had “overcome a major barrier” to reaching fusion, the BBC gushed, while the Wall Street Journal described the achievement as a breakthrough that could herald an era of clean, cheap energy. It is certainly true that nuclear fusion would have a beneficial impact on our planet by liberating vast amounts of energy without generating high levels of carbon emissions and would be an undoubted boost in the battle against climate change. The trouble is that we have been presented with such visions many times before. In 1958, Sir John Cockcroft claimed his Zeta fusion project would supply the world with “an inexhaustible supply of fuel”. It didn’t. In 1989, Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons announced they had achieved fusion using simple laboratory equipment, work that made global headlines but which has never been replicated. To this list you can also add the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (Iter), a huge facility being built in Saint-Paul-lès-Durance in Provence, France, that was supposed to achieve fusion by 2023 but which is over 10 years behind schedule and tens of billions of dollars over budget. In each case, it was predicted that the construction of the first commercially viable nuclear fusion plants was only a decade or two away and would transform our lives. Those hopes never materialised and have led to a weary cynicism spreading among hacks and scientists. As they now joke: “Fusion is 30 years away – and always will be.” It was odd for Jennifer Granholm, the US energy secretary, to argue that the NIF’s achievement was “one of the most impressive scientific feats of the 21st century”. This is a hard claim to justify for a century that has already witnessed the discovery of the Higgs boson, the creation of Covid-19 vaccines, the launch of the James Webb telescope and the unravelling of the human genome. By comparison, the ignition event at the NIF is second-division stuff. Most scientists have been careful in their responses to the over-hyping of the NIF “breakthrough”. They accept that a key step has been taking towards commercial fusion power but insist such plants remain distant goals. They should not be seen as likely saviours that will extract us from the desperate energy crisis we now face – despite all the claims that were made last week. Humanity has brought itself to a point where its terrible dependence on fossil fuels threatens to trigger a 2C jump in global temperatures compared with our pre-industrial past. The consequences will include flooding, fires, worsening storms, rising sea levels, spreading diseases and melting ice caps. Here, scientists are clear. Fusion power will not arrive in time to save the world. “We are still a way off commercial fusion and it cannot help us with the climate crisis now,” said Aneeqa Khan, a research fellow in nuclear fusion at Manchester University. This view was backed by Tony Roulstone, a nuclear energy researcher at Cambridge University. “This result from NIF is a success for science, but it is still a long way from providing useful, abundant clean energy.” At present, there are two main routes to nuclear fusion. One involves confining searing hot plasma in a powerful magnetic field. The Iter reactor follows such an approach. The other – adopted at the NIF facility – uses lasers to blast deuterium-tritium pellets causing them to collapse and fuse into helium. In both cases, reactions occur at more than 100 million C and involve major technological headaches in controlling them. Fusion therefore remains a long-term technology, although many new investors and entrepreneurs – including Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos – have recently turned their attention to the field, raising hopes that a fresh commercial impetus could reinvigorate the development of commercial plants. This input is to be welcomed but we should be emphatic: fusion will not arrive in time to save the planet from climate change. Electricity plants powered by renewable sources or nuclear fission offer the only short-term alternatives to those that burn fossil fuels. We need to pin our hopes on these power sources. Fusion may earn its place later in the century but it would be highly irresponsible to rely on an energy source that will take at least a further two decades to materialise – at best. • Robin McKie is the Observer’s science and environment editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/apr/14/power-rangers-reunion-mighty-morphin-netflix","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-14T12:00:11Z","webTitle":"‘I could have made the same money at McDonald’s’: the Power Rangers on fame, regrets and their shock reunion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/14/power-rangers-reunion-mighty-morphin-netflix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/14/power-rangers-reunion-mighty-morphin-netflix","fields":{"bodyText":"In the mid 1980s, the Israeli-American media mogul Haim Saban was stuck in a Tokyo hotel with nothing to watch on TV. Until, that is, he came across five spandex-wearing masked superheroes battling outlandish rubber monsters – and decided to adapt Japanese show, Super Sentai, for US TV, as Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. When its pilot made it to air in 1993, viewers were treated to an evil space witch escaping moon imprisonment to battle an android-assisted character who was simultaneously a wizard and a big head in a jar. There were giant mech robots known as Zords, plus the martial arts and acrobatic skills of their operators – “five teenagers with attitude”. Their grandiose hope? To save the Earth from the forces of evil – and hopefully keep the actors playing them away from the breadline. “I lived in an apartment with no furniture, I slept on the floor and used boxes to put my TV on,” says actor David Yost of his early days in Los Angeles before being cast as the Blue Power Ranger. Luckily, his time having almost nothing to his name only lasted three months. Once he started making a living from battling the space witch – AKA arch-villain Rita Repulsa – success was instant, if baffling. “We filmed 40 episodes, then once it aired, it became this thing we couldn’t explain,” he smiles. The stratospheric success of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers outstripped anything that had been expected of it. The energising mash-up of Japanese action footage – where sparks shot out of the costumes anytime a ranger was struck – and campy, cheesy one-liners from the US-created script proved to be a hit with kids. Ratings were through the roof and toy sales quickly exceeded expectations. Fox ordered 20 more episodes, sending the production company, Saban Entertainment, scrambling for footage. The more episodes they created, the more ludicrous the onscreen antics ended up becoming. Jason Narvy, who played the slapstick comic relief character Skull, remembers “being dressed as an old woman for one scene, then an hour later running down the street with a small chimpanzee”. The absurdity of the show was not lost on him. He recalls one time both acting and serving as assistant director. “I’m in 18th-century British military regalia,” he says, “there’s a stunt guy dressed as a rat and ready to be hurled across a wire rig by an air cannon. I wave my sword to yell: ‘Action!’ That’s, like, Monty Python stuff.” Preposterous storylines and bizarre villains were all part of the appeal. Limited by the Japanese Sentai footage, Saban leaned into the wacky elements. “We had a lipstick monster; we fought a pachinko machine; we fought a turtle that had a stop light on its head,” says Yost. “The list goes on and on.” David Fielding, who played omnipotent recruiter Zordon, was tickled by the show’s villains, as he would often “walk into the recording booth and ask: ‘What monster are we fighting this week? The giant purse. Fantastic!’” Narvy says that “on any given day, some five-headed monster with 8,000 eyeballs would casually walk past you on the way to the set. Once we had a delivery guy dropping something off at the front desk. When one of these monstrosities walked past, he just stared at me, incredulous. I said, “Well, there’s something you don’t see everyday … Of course, I do.” However, in the years since it first broadcast, the show has faced criticism for its sometimes blatant racial stereotyping of the cast, such as the only Black actor being the breakdancing Black Ranger and the Asian cast member playing the Yellow Ranger. Yost, though, suggests that the show’s inclusion of different ethnic backgrounds on screen, fighting evil together, preceded a lot of racial representation that we see in kids’ TV today – particularly in terms of the depiction of Trini, the Yellow Ranger character, played by Thuy Trang. “It was a groundbreaking role,” he says. “And for Asian women especially, because they’re being represented and she was strong, powerful and a superhero.” Production was also famously problematic. Cast disputes about low pay reportedly affected filming, and eventually led to three of the cast quitting. (Walter Emanuel Jones, who played the Black Ranger, claimed: “I could have worked the window at McDonald’s and probably made the same money the first season.”) Safety issues stemming from it being a non-unionised production were also an issue according to Amy Jo Johnson, who played the original Pink Ranger. In a 2017 open letter in Variety she wrote that she “almost died a few times because of the makeshift low-budget stunts we performed”. Most notoriously, Yost has alleged that homophobia and harassment were behind his departure in 1996, having told NBC that it caused him to become suicidal. Although homophobia is not a topic he addresses during our interview, Yost does say that “as young actors, we were just signing contracts because you’re going to make more money than being a waiter.” The cast felt they were dispensable in the eyes of the production. “The person in charge was not a gracious person,” he says. “He was like: ‘If you don’t like it, you’ll be replaced. The kids don’t like you, they like the colours.’” Saban Entertainment would sell the franchise to Hasbro in 2018 for $522m (£419m). Power Rangers, though, has never really gone away, rotating its cast of superheroes every few years and becoming one of the world’s longest-running live-action kids’ TV shows. But now it’s attempting to pay homage to its roots with a worldwide, feature-length Netflix special. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always celebrates the 30-year anniversary of the brand, in a show that sees the return of Rita Repulsa alongside two of the original rangers: Yost, as the Blue Ranger Billy, and Walter Emanuel Jones, as the Black Ranger Zack. The Pink, Red and Yellow Rangers are from the second generation of cast members – who replaced the originals when they left – as not every previous actor was overjoyed at the idea of appearing. “Please stop saying I didn’t do [the] reunion because of money,” wrote Johnson on Twitter. “Simply not true. Maybe I just didn’t want to wear spandex in my 50s or couldn’t go to NZ for a month. Or none of ur beeswax,” she added. According to her, co-star Jason David Frank, who played the Green Ranger, Tommy, had also decided not to take part, prior to killing himself last November. “JDF &amp; I both chose not to for our own reasons. They filmed before he passed.” Trang died in a car accident in 2001, and Yost says the special is a tribute to the two original cast members lost since filming ceased. It is dedicated to Trang and Frank, with a particular attempt to honour Trang by introducing Charlie Kersh as Minh, the onscreen daughter of Trang’s Yellow Ranger character, Trini. Trini’s previous colleagues, Billy and Zack, take Minh under their wing and train her to become part of their troupe, in a plot that sees the heroes reunite to avenge the death of the Yellow Ranger. It also features a number of returning voice actors, locations and characters – including the musician behind the much-loved Go Go Power Rangers theme tune. It’s all very much in keeping with the tone of the original. “The word cheesy gets thrown around as though it’s a bad thing,” says Alwyn Dale who, along with Becca Barnes, is the head writer on the project. “But there’s a real joy to the tone of Power Rangers that has to be protected. The minute it becomes too serious or grimdark, there’s a real gut feeling that rejects that.” The project was kickstarted by Yost, who pitched it as an eight-part miniseries to Netflix a few years ago. In January 2023, he shared the script for the first two episodes on Twitter in the hope that “they would jump on [them] and develop [them] for the 30-year anniversary”. Citing legal issues, Netflix declined, instead offering Yost what became Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always. “I don’t want to use the word ‘consolation’,” he says, “but they said: ‘We can’t do that right now – we can create this special.’ It was a lot of work on their part to get from there to a shooting script. I gave my input and I think it turned out pretty good.” Given how much personal turmoil the franchise has previously caused Yost, you can’t help but wonder: why would he want to revisit it? Apparently, new owners Hasbro being happy to take the actors’ wellbeing seriously played a big part. “When we originally filmed, we didn’t have a lot of protections, we didn’t have health insurance,” says Yost. “I, being a young dumb Hollywood kid, got into a bar fight and got my nose broken in season one, so I’m walking around with a broken nose. I think at that point [Saban] realised ‘we should maybe give these kids a stipend, a certain amount of money that they can apply to getting health insurance’. That instance woke them up, but unfortunately never woke them up to deal with the union.” He finishes by saying, “I’m so grateful to Hasbro for listening to me, and taking it seriously to do this under the contracts and rules of the Screen Actors Guild Union – that’s the big difference.” Throughout its three-decade history, the Power Rangers franchise has entertained generation after generation of children, as well as generating billions in merchandise revenue. What makes it stand the test of time? Fielding thinks that many viewers were inspired by it to pursue specific careers, “like emergency medical technicians or firefighters, serving the general public”. Yost, meanwhile, holds that the show’s success is a testament “to the chemistry the original cast had together”. Narvy argues it is in its appeal to so many different kids: “At a time when superheroes were largely one type, one gender, one ethnicity, Power Rangers celebrated and empowered diversity. Kids saw themselves represented on screen.” Whatever its secret, with the new Netflix special it doesn’t look like ending any time soon. • This article was amended on 14 April 2023.

The ruangrupa group, founded in Jakarta in 2000, are the first artists from Asia to top the ArtReview Power 100. Their position “reflects the growing influence of the global south and the move towards greater diversity in the art world,” ArtReview said. The collective organised this year’s documenta, an important art exhibition that takes place every five years in Germany. The show was controversial and was accused of including antisemitic content. A large-scale outdoor mural that featured apparently antisemitic caricatures of Jews was removed days after the exhibition opened, and documenta’s general director, Sabine Schormann, resigned. In a statement posted online several days later, ruangrupa said: “The truth of the matter is that we collectively failed to spot the figure in the work, which is a character that evokes classical stereotypes of antisemitism. We acknowledge that this was our error.” ArtReview acknowledged that this year’s exhibition had been “continuously mired in controversy about racial and religious prejudice (antisemitism in particular)”. It prompted “heated debates about historical positions … that went all the way to government levels”. JJ Charlesworth, editor at ArtReview, said: “ruangrupa took the top position because their documenta offered a challenge to the established function of big art exhibitions and conventions of curating – conventions which still drive the Anglo-European art world and the European museum model. “Part of that is the question of the power of selection, control over who is included and excluded. Pursuing a more devolved, less top-down approach to exhibition-making, in which participants invited other participants in a kind of organisational daisy-chain, was always going to make controversy more likely. “But ruangrupa’s no 1 position is a recognition of the questions they ask about the institutions of the art world, not the debates provoked by a small number of works included in the exhibition.” This year’s Power 100 placed unions at No 3 after a wave of disruption at museums and galleries across the world. At No 8, photographer Nan Goldin had “notably instigated a profound shift in the ethics of museum patronage through her campaign to call to account the philanthropy of the Sackler family (closely tied to opioid manufacturers Purdue Pharma)”. Museums and galleries around the world have removed the Sackler name from their buildings in the past year. Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, at No 10, “steers a philanthropic organisation committing substantial financial resources to the art world’s social justice agendas”. The Top 10 also included Cecilia Alemani, the Italian curator described as a “disrupting influence” at the Venice Biennale; film-maker Hito Steyerl; cultural theorist Fred Moten; David Zwirner, owner of galleries in New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong; Turner prize-winning photographer Wolfgang Tillmans; and American artist Simone Leigh, the joint winner of the Golden Lion at this year’s Venice Biennale. Further down the list, Forensic Architecture came in at No 25. The collective “continues to expand the role art has in society beyond the exhibition space through its judicial investigations of social and environmental crimes”, said ArtReview. The Chinese visual artist Ai Weiwei was ranked at number 51 on the list. The list is chosen by more than 30 people from across the world, who remain anonymous. Last year, NFTs (non-fungible tokens) topped the list, and Black Lives Matter was No 1 the year before.

British officials at the G7 foreign ministers’ summit in Japan said they were expecting Russia to retaliate and “must be prepared” for extreme tactics as it attempted to hold on to Ukrainian territory. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said last month that Moscow was ready for the Ukrainians to hit back, warning that his country would use “absolutely any weapon” if Kyiv attempted to retake Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. There appeared to be an acknowledgment in Moscow that its forces might soon find themselves on the defensive in Ukraine as Russia’s own winter offensive appeared to be slowing down. Russia’s nuclear rhetoric has united the G7 ministers, who issued a statement after their two-hour meeting on Monday condemning the threats as “unacceptable” and criticising Putin’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. G7 officials said there was an “open exchange of views” in the talks on the approach to the Ukrainian conflict, including on “future prospects” for bringing the war to an end, which Rishi Sunak has said would eventually be around the negotiating table. However, Foreign Office sources suggested that the only way to finally resolve the conflict would be for Putin to withdraw his troops from Crimea and for the west to give Kyiv the tools to finish the job. Despite pressure from Ukraine, and others including the former UK prime minister Boris Johnson, to increase military support – including more tanks and fighter jets – the UK believes it is providing what the country needs. Sources said it was already committing its “rainy day fund”. A transatlantic group of former senior diplomats and high-level military advisers said on Monday that the war in Ukraine was on course to become a stalemate unless the west went “all in” and increased its level of military support. The group said that “declarations of unwavering support” were not enough and “actions still fail to match the rhetoric” in a reflection of military assessments in European capitals and Washington. At the G7 summit, the ministers reaffirmed their commitment to “intensifying, fully coordinating and enforcing” sanctions against Russia, agreeing to be more coordinated to prevent evasion of the measures and to target third parties supplying weapons to Moscow. It came as the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, demanded the release of a British-Russian opposition leader after he was sentenced to 25 years in prison by a court in Moscow, paying tribute to Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr for “bravely” denouncing Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin critic, who has twice survived poisonings, was convicted on charges of treason and denigrating the Russian military in what he denounced as a show trial. The Russian ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin, was summoned to the Foreign Office for a dressing down on Monday over Russia’s human rights obligations, including the right to a fair trial. Meanwhile, the US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s G7 bilateral talks with his French counterpart, Catherine Colonna, over-ran, prompting speculation her talks with the US had been fraught. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, provoked controversy last week when he said, on a flight back from China, that Europe should not become a “vassal” to the US on foreign policy. He had previously been accused of naivety when he said Moscow must not be “humiliated” and would need security guarantees. G7 officials stressed that all member nations, including France, were united on the need to prevent Putin’s attempts to divide and conquer. Eastern European governments, in particular, had accused Macron of failing to learn the lessons of the war. Without US military and financial support for Kyiv, more than 30 times that of France, Ukrainian resistance would have already crumbled, they believe. In separate talks in Japan, G7 nations including UK, US, Canada, Japan and France formed an alliance to develop shared supply chains for nuclear fuel, aimed at pushing Russia out of the international nuclear energy market. The UK’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said the five countries would use their civil nuclear power sectors to undermine Russia’s grip on supply chains, cutting off another means for Putin to fund his invasion of Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/17/most-of-australias-nuclear-waste-comes-from-lucas-heights-should-it-stay-there","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-16T16:30:40Z","webTitle":"Most of Australia’s nuclear waste comes from Lucas Heights – should it stay there?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/17/most-of-australias-nuclear-waste-comes-from-lucas-heights-should-it-stay-there","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/17/most-of-australias-nuclear-waste-comes-from-lucas-heights-should-it-stay-there","fields":{"bodyText":"The vast majority of Australia’s future radioactive waste will be produced by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto) Lucas Heights facility in Sydney, the latest figures show. For 40 years governments have pushed for a national radioactive waste storage facility, often claiming it is because currently waste is held at more than 100 sites across the country. But the latest statistics show almost all of it is in that one facility. A new inventory of Australia’s radioactive waste, published in September by the Australian Radioactive Waste Agency, shows a larger than expected increase in waste in the future. Australia’s waste is either low level (LLW), which is mainly from laboratories, or intermediate level (ILW), which is from nuclear medicine. ILW emits more radiation and requires more shielding. There are many variable factors, but the report notes that “the estimated volumes of Ansto’s future LLW and ILW are substantially greater than previously reported”. It estimates the levels of LLW in 100 years and ILW in 50 years. For LLW, that is a change in how future levels are measured. For ILW, it was a matter of having to revise existing estimates. Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup “For LLW, the changes are mainly due to revised estimates of future waste generation rates (about 10% increase annually) and increased timeframes (100 years instead of 50 years waste volumes),” the report notes. “For ILW, the main reason is that volume uncertainty is now included in the packaged volume estimate, where it had not been included previously.” Ansto’s waste is estimated to make up 12,972 cubic metres of the country’s 13,287 cubic metres LLW (97.6%) in the next 100 years, and 3,753 cubic metres of the country’s 3,887 cubic metres ILW (96.8%). Dave Sweeney, the nuclear free campaigner from the Australian Conservation Foundation, is opposed to the federal government’s plan to move the country’s waste to a single facility near Kimba in South Australia. He says it should stay where it (mostly) is. “It’s Ansto’s waste facility,” he says. “Ansto’s 97% of intermediate and low level waste. It’s not a national facility. It’s Ansto’s facility. “It’s absolutely striking.” Sweeney says Ansto has the capacity to store the waste indefinitely, especially considering a recent $60m investment to expand its storage capacity. The local Aboriginal people, the Barngarla people, are also opposed to the site being on their traditional lands. The South Australian Greens senator Barbara Pocock says there is “no pressing problem” with waste storage, so they may as well leave it where it is. “They’re better off leaving it safely,” she says, “well protected, with all the right safeguards in place, than to pull it out and have a double-handling non-solution.” Pocock is also concerned about the transport of waste from Lucas Heights and other facilities to the planned South Australian site. “There hasn’t been a proper discussion in the SA community on the views of the transport of nuclear waste through our communities,” she says. An Ansto spokesperson says having a single facility is “in line with international best practice”, and moving the waste is in line with commitments given to the Lucas Heights community. “The vast majority of the radioactive waste we produce is directly associated with the production of nuclear medicine that every Australian, on average, will need during their lifetime,” the spokesperson says. “Because of this, Ansto will always need to have facilities to properly treat, prepare and consolidate these wastes before they can go to a national radioactive waste management facility. But we are not the appropriate place for Australia’s waste to be held.” The spokesperson says a facility of the size needed would not fit on the Ansto campus, that existing storage will be at full capacity within a decade, and the new storage will be at capacity by 2038. “Ultimately Ansto must be in the business of medicine production and supporting research, not diverting more space, more personnel and more resources to long-term waste management,” the spokesperson says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/26/morning-mail-greens-send-warning-over-petroleum-tax-period-poverty-bites-russia-moves-nukes","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T20:48:27Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: Greens send warning over petroleum tax, period poverty bites, Russia moves nukes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/26/morning-mail-greens-send-warning-over-petroleum-tax-period-poverty-bites-russia-moves-nukes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/26/morning-mail-greens-send-warning-over-petroleum-tax-period-poverty-bites-russia-moves-nukes","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning.

The plant’s operator, Energoatom, said on Thursday that Grossi had left the site after a visit that was delayed by several hours because of shelling, but that five International Atomic Energy Agency representatives would remain, probably until Saturday. “We have achieved something very important today and the important thing is the IAEA is staying here – let the world know that the IAEA is staying at Zaporizhzhia,” Grossi said in a video from Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency. He said explanations given to the 14-strong team during the visit, which lasted “a few hours”, were “very clear”. He praised the “dedicated work” of the plant’s staff who were “carrying on professionally with their work” in “very difficult circumstances”. The plant was occupied by Russian forces in March but is still connected to the Ukrainian grid and run by Energoatom employees. The area has come under repeated fire in recent weeks, sparking fears of a radiation disaster. Moscow and Kyiv have traded blame for the shelling, with Ukraine alleging Russia is using the plant as a shield, storing weapons there and launching attacks from the area around it, while Moscow accuses Ukraine of recklessly firing on the zone. Grossi’s comments came after both sides accused each other of trying to sabotage the IAEA visit, aimed at conducting “indispensable nuclear safety and security and safeguard activities”, delaying the mission by several hours. Enerhodar, the city beside the plant, came under fire at dawn, its mayor said, and Russian forces reportedly shelled the pre-agreed route the inspectors were meant to take. Moscow claimed to have thwarted a Ukrainian attempt to capture the plant. Grossi has said the inspection aimed to establish a permanent presence at the plant, but Russian officials had said the inspectors, wearing blue body armour and travelling in white armoured Land Cruisers with UN markings, would remain for just one day. Ukraine said it could not guarantee the team’s security. The energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, told CNN that Ukraine had “fulfilled its international obligations” and done all it could, but the situation around the plant remained “a mess”. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow was “doing everything” for the visiting inspectors “to be able to complete their tasks”. The Russian foreign ministry’s spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, blamed Ukraine for any radiation danger. “The EU is busy with an important decision – whether or not to issue visas to Russians,” she added. “But radiation doesn’t need a visa to cross borders. If something happens at Zaporizhzhia, it will not be about visas, passports or borders.” Robert Mardini, the head of the international committee of the Red Cross, said it was time to “stop playing with fire” and instead protect the plant. “The slightest miscalculation could trigger devastation we will regret for decades,” he said. Mardini said it was encouraging that the IAEA team was inspecting the plant because the stakes were “immense … When hazardous sites become battlegrounds, the consequences for millions of people and the environment can be catastrophic and last many years.” Energoatom said early on Thursday that it had activated emergency procedures and shut down the facility’s No 5 reactor “as a result of another mortar shelling by Russian … forces at the site”. The operator said auxiliary diesel generators had been fired up at the plant’s non-operational reactor No 2 after a power supply line used for the plant’s own needs was damaged by the shelling, but it said unit No 6 “continues to work”. Dmytro Orlov, the mayor of Enerhodar, posted pictures of damaged buildings with smoke spiralling above them on the Telegram messaging app, saying Russian troops had been “shelling since dawn” with mortars, rockets and automatic weapons. Energoatom said the city had come under fire from the air. “A group of Russian K-52 attack helicopters worked over the city, striking residential areas,” it said, adding that one mortar attack struck “in the immediate vicinity” of the plant. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, accused Moscow of trying to wreck the inspection, saying Russia was acting like a terrorist state. “It is Russia that is responsible for everything happening at the plant and in Enerhodar,” he said. Moscow, meanwhile accused Kyiv – without evidence – of attempting to sabotage or recapture the Zaporizhzhia plant by sending in “up to 60 people on seven high-speed motor boats”. The IAEA mission was held up at a checkpoint in Novooleksandrivka, about 12 miles from the plant, early on Thursday. Oleksandr Starukh, the administrative head of the Zaporizhzhia region, accused Russian forces of “shelling the pre-agreed route”. Meanwhile, intensive fighting raged across the nearby Kherson region, most of which was seized by Russian forces at the start of the invasion six months ago and where Ukraine began a counteroffensive on Monday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2022/dec/30/colombia-first-female-electrical-line-workers","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-30T06:30:41Z","webTitle":"Girl power: Colombia’s first female electrical line workers train to keep the lights on","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/dec/30/colombia-first-female-electrical-line-workers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2022/dec/30/colombia-first-female-electrical-line-workers","fields":{"bodyText":"Marianela Hernández Valencia knows what life without electricity is like. “As a child, I grew up in a house without electricity, which meant having to do homework by candlelight,” she says. “It was difficult.” Today, the 28-year-old is among 15 women hoping to graduate as one of Colombia’s first-ever intake of apprentice linewomen, in La Ceja, a small town about 40km southeast of Medellín, Colombia’s second-largest city. Line workers scale towers and transmission lines hundreds of feet above the ground to install and repair power cables. They are often the first responders after a storm or natural disaster and are regularly away from home for long periods. Kitted out with belts and safety harnesses, the first apprentice linewomen gather around the teachers for a motivational talk before training Graduates of the year-long pilot project, led by ISA, Latin America’s largest energy transmission company, with the training group Tener Futuro Corporation, are guaranteed a job with one of two contractors, Instelec and Salomón Durán. Students are taught about safety, rigging and knot tying, all in a hands-on environment. As more companies seek to diversify the workplace, it may seem there has never been a better time for women to enter the trade. Yet, few consider applying. The organisers of the scheme aim to change that by targeting the apprenticeships solely at women and providing a safe space for them to learn. A week after the call went out for female applicants, 723 had registered interest. A trainee fixes a porcelain insulator in place, to prevent live wires from coming into contact with each other or the utility pole. A line worker typically carries between 9-13.5kg (20-30lbs) on their belt “I’ve always been drawn to electrical work,” says Hernández Valencia, who once worked as an electrician’s assistant. “That feeling you get when you’re able to help switch the light back on and seeing the kids’ faces light up – it’s indescribable.” She was working as a restaurant administrator in Medellín when her partner – a lineman – told her about the recruitment drive. Her application was successful, but two weeks into the apprenticeship, her partner dealt an unexpected blow. “For the first few weeks when we arrived, we overlapped with another group of trainees – men – and my partner wasn’t happy about it. Having first insisted I sign up, he was suddenly telling me to choose between him and the training,” she says. “I chose to continue training.” Apprentices during their training. At the end of the course all graduates are guaranteed a job Hernández Valencia’s refusal to give up her course and the subsequent breakdown of her relationship have made her all the more determined. Her teachers say she is an outstanding student, and is emerging as a group leader. While the public has been mostly supportive of the trainee linewomen, some online comments have been critical, some sexist. “In Colombia, we have very complex cultural egos,” says Claudia Laguna, an engineer and ISA’s corporate projects specialist, who thought up the project. “Women are very capable but they’ve always been relegated.” It is more than 10 years since Colombia achieved 95% electrical coverage, but access for the most remote areas is difficult. In 2020, an estimated 1.9 million Colombians still lacked access to electricity. About 2,500 line workers are active, and an estimated 500 more are needed to keep up with electrification demands; there are plans to build between 1,200 and 2,500km of new power lines by 2025. Two months into the training, most students have conquered their fear of heights, but the art of moving along a cable takes time to master Clockwise: The offices and lodges of the Catholic University of the East, where the training camp for linewomen is based; students learn how to tie specific knots, as well as the proper use of various ropes, slings, block and tackle; tools of the trade; At 5pm after receiving feedback, the women retire to their rooms to catch up with loved ones Trainees aged from 17 to 31 receive a stipend and boarding. For those who stay the course, an opportunity to travel also beckons. But it does not come without sacrifice. Most of the women are mothers who may have had to make difficult decisions about childcare. Diana Lizeth Lizarazo Moreno started the programme when her youngest was 18 months old. When her grandmother died, she was given special dispensation to return home for the funeral. “My daughter didn’t recognise me. In no time at all, she had grown attached to my sister,” she says. “That’s hard, but at least I know that she is in good hands.” Mother of two Diana Lizeth Lizarazo Moreno and Jessica Osorio, 23, who suspended her studies in biotechnology The training is challenging. On any given day, line workers typically carry between 9kg and 13.5kg on their belt alone. But the women have qualities beyond strength, says Laguna, “like attention to detail and ensuring safe outcomes”. Mental stamina is key. “You need to be able to keep a cool head, especially when something unexpected happens and you’re high up a tower,” says Lizarazo Moreno. La Ceja’s high altitude, combined with scaling tens of metres and carrying heavy equipment, can sometimes lead to dizzy spells All the women on the course reported that they had grown in confidence. “You need confidence in yourself, but also in your team,” says Jessica Osorio, 23, who was a year away from completing a biotechnology engineering degree when she decided to suspend her studies. “[I] wanted to do something out of my comfort zone and it turns out I love this work.” A shattered mobile displays a memory from back home. Spending a long time away from loved ones is one reason some apprentices drop out With a month left before the first stage of the training, just 15 of the original 30 women remain. “A number of candidates failed the medical test. Once we selected the final 30, a combination of factors all played a part, from suddenly being faced with the reality of having to leave your home and family – in many cases, children – to struggling with logistics and childcare, as well as self-doubt and dealing with other people’s opinions. It’s been a learning curve,” says Laguna. But the sector is committed to opening itself up to women, with three cohorts of 20 women planned for 2023, she says. “Ultimately, it’s about creating a virtuous chain, and the belief is that by supporting these women now, you help establish the foundations for creating sustainable value moving forward.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/sep/20/donald-trump-maralago-nuclear-secrets-whitney-houston-security-flaws","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-20T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"80s hits and nuclear secrets: security concerns plague Trump’s Mar-a-Lago","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/20/donald-trump-maralago-nuclear-secrets-whitney-houston-security-flaws","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/sep/20/donald-trump-maralago-nuclear-secrets-whitney-houston-security-flaws","fields":{"bodyText":"At a certain point in an average evening at Mar-a-Lago, the lights go down and the volume goes up, as the proprietor and former president of the United States turns DJ for the night. A member of the Mar-a-Lago private club said that following a period of withdrawal after his election defeat, Donald Trump has in recent months assumed the role of social ringmaster, deciding to bring a disco vibe to the Palm Beach resort after dark. “At about 9.30pm every night, he’s sitting at his table, whether on the patio or inside, and they bring a laptop over and he starts picking songs, and he starts being a DJ for the night, but it’s sort of funny because he picks like the same 10 songs every night,” the club member said. The Trump playlist is of a certain era, when he was a regular clubber in New York. The signature tune is the Village People’s YMCA, alongside The Greatest Love of All by Whitney Houston, and a few Elton John numbers. “Sometimes he dances to it,” the club member said. “He will be at his table and he’ll dance while sitting.” Towards the end of the evening, Trump will play a hymn, How Great Thou Art, which topped the charts when Elvis Presley sang it. It was a favorite of Trump’s father, Fred, a sentimental way of drawing a Mar-a-Lago soiree to a close. What might have otherwise seemed no more than a characteristically bizarre twist for a post-presidential career, looks more significant now that it is known that all the while the lights were low, the music was playing, guests were tipsy and the host was otherwise engaged, there were thousands of government documents, many of them highly sensitive, and at least one of them containing nuclear secrets, being kept illicitly in rooms and closets nearby. And all of this was unfolding in a venue described by former intelligence officials as a priority target for foreign spies. “Without any question the former president, and those in his circle will be very important targets for any foreign intelligence service. They will be looking at: how do we get into that circle?” said Douglas London, a 34-year veteran of the CIA’s clandestine service, and author of The Recruiter: Spying and the Lost Art of American Intelligence. London added: “He’s brought in really questionable people with various skeletons in their closets, financial or personal or political, who have vulnerabilities a foreign intelligence service could exploit.” It is a scenario which in other circumstances, might make for an uproarious comedy series, featuring spies from around the world tripping over each other in the dark as they race each other to grab hold of the motherlode of state secrets, as YMCA echoes around the darkened corridors. The setting is suitably flamboyant. When it was built in the 1920s for a cereal heiress, Marjorie Merriweather Post, the style of the 58-bedroom palace was described as Spanish-Moorish-Portuguese-Venetian. There are gargoyles that look like they were borrowed from medieval Britain. The original decor was chosen by a Viennese theatrical designer. When Trump bought it for $10m (£8.75m) in 1985, it had 58 bedrooms, an adjoining golf course and three bomb shelters. He said at the time he thought of the purchase as a “statement” rather than somewhere he could imagine living, but the high-end Floridian lifestyle grew on him and the place became his favourite home. In the 1990s, after a string of bankruptcies, he tried to squeeze desperately needed cash out of the property by trying to split it into plots, hold on to the main house, and sell the rest, but he was blocked by the local planning board. The board also tried to veto his plan B, turning the estate into a private club, but he was able to outmanoeuvre his opponents on the panel by assiduously cultivating individual members and pointing out publicly and embarrassingly that almost all the other clubs in Palm Beach did not admit Jews or Black people. There were few if any African Americans in the area who could afford the $100,000 (£87,454) initiation fee, which was doubled in 2017, but plenty of wealthy Jews, who had made their money in real estate and clothing. They became the bulk of the membership, the majority of them Democrats. When Trump succeeded Obama as president, and Mar-a-Lago became the “winter White House”, the ambience began to change. Trump had no time for the official presidential retreat at Camp David, which he saw as too rustic. Also the Trump Organization made no money from him staying there. Mar-a-Lago was another matter. The president saw no distinction between his personal life, his business and the public office, and Trump’s presidency became one of the club’s leading attractions. It was another label under the Trump brand. Paying guests were able to witness real-life scenes like Trump huddling with the then Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and his aides to hammer out a joint response to a North Korean missile test. In April 2017, Trump told the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, about the missile strikes he had authorized in Syria while the leaders sat in the Mar-a-Lago dining room eating what the former president described as “the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you have ever seen”. After Trump was defeated in 2020, he decamped to his Florida retreat, taking with him boxes full of secret documents and a new clientele. The crowd that hung around Trump International hotel in Washington followed him to Mar-a-Lago. “The club used to be serious money, serious players in business. Some really big players through the years have been members,” a longtime member reflected somewhat ruefully. “The new members of the club are a little bit Maga,” the veteran member said. “It’s very eclectic, a lot of foreigners, people that have made money in cryptocurrency, Oklahoma, fracking money. It looks more like the menagerie at the Trump Hotel in Washington.” Asked specifically about the foreigners, this member said: “A lot of different people there that they didn’t really have before. You’ll have Chinese people. You’ll have maybe some additional Arab people.” Even during the Trump presidency, there were significant holes in Mar-a-Lago’s security. Over the 2018 Thanksgiving holiday, a teenager, Mark Lindblom, slipped past guards and entered the club through a tunnel from the beach. Two Chinese women were caught trespassing. One of them, Yujing Zhang, had no fewer than four mobile phones, an external hard drive, as well as five sim cards and a “signal detector” gadget for locating hidden microphones or cameras. She was deported without any clarity on what she was doing there and why she was in possession of such an array of electronics. In the post-presidency, there are far fewer controls. “Typically once a president becomes former president, there’s a scale-back in resources at the Secret Service, but that really is something that doesn’t lend itself to the Mar-a-Lago environment because of the obvious threats there,” said Frank Figliuzzi, a former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence. Each year the club hires 80 to 90 foreign workers. They at least get vetted, but that is no guarantee against an insider threat, Figliuzzi said “The fact that four years ago, the Secret Service vetted the guy who serves Trump Diet Coke 12 times a day, doesn’t mean that that guy is invulnerable to a $200,000 [£174,936] payment from a foreign intelligence agency,” he said. The problem of the club members and their guests is far greater. “Who are these members? Who’s vetting them?” Figliuzzi asked. “If you have the requisite money and you plunk it down, it appears you’re a member. And now here come your family members and guests and their cousins and their in-laws. And is it really possible for the Secret Service to even begin to think that they could vet the guest side of the house?” All this helps explain why a Russian-speaking Ukrainian-born woman called Inna Yashchyshyn was able to mingle with club members and Trump himself in the spring and summer of 2021, posing as Anna de Rothschild, a Monaco-bred scion of the banking family. Whether Yashchyshyn, and the two Chinese interlopers, were just opportunists or connected to something more sinister, remains unknown. But then the same could be said of much of the Mar-a-Lago crowd, especially the new arrivals. But perhaps the biggest question mark is hanging over the resort’s wounded and vengeful owner and DJ. No one knows what plans he had for his stolen trove of state secrets. “Whatever he selected was because he had some intent to do something with it,” London said. “The question mark is: what were his intentions? But none of it is going to be a happy story. None of it is going to end well, in terms of the impact on national security.” • This article was amended on 20 September 2022.

In those very worst of times, I witnessed the very best of humanity. I am amazed, therefore, that in her war against the “anti-growth coalition”, Liz Truss attempts to squander one of the few positive elements to emerge from the pandemic: cooperation and mutual support within communities. She talks in aggressive and combative terms about those who don’t agree with her ideas for growth, hoping for another Brexit-like split in society. During the pandemic, our hospital and community, like many throughout the world, worked together to support and care for one another. All ideological and political arguments were set aside as we realised that we had to work together. The strong ties that we built during the pandemic are being threatened by the rhetoric of the prime minister and her cabinet. She is behaving like the worst of tyrants, encouraging communities to look for the enemy within. This is disgraceful behaviour. It is so sad that she seeks to highlight the divisions in society, rather than calling for us all to work together, to make our communities safe, prosperous and happy once again. Josephine Feeney Leicester • The opinion pieces in last Saturday’s paper revealed just how ideological and fantastical Tory policy really is. I would like to suggest that Conservative ministers come and spend some time in towns and cities like mine, not just on a flying “here today, gone tomorrow” visit, but as members of the community. Were they to come to Newport, I would like to introduce them to the teachers who give substantially to their in-house food schemes out of a sense of vocational responsibility; the churches and other civic groups that run school uniform banks, breakfast clubs and night shelters; the Mind charity groups that try to provide struggling people with a little peace and quiet for a few hours a week; the outreach schemes that feed the homeless on the streets, and so many more. I would like to show members of the government what dignity, compassion and community look like in practice. I would like to introduce them to the poor helping the poor, and I would like to remind them that the rights and freedoms that some of them now enjoy were won in cities like mine. But above all, I would like to show them how compassion trumps ideology every time. Canon Andrew Lightbown Newport Cathedral • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

After a £9bn investment by Malaysia-backed developers and more than a decade of restoration, the doors to the almost century-old decommissioned power station opened on Friday for the first time in 40 years. The space has been transformed into a glitzy shopping centre of 250 stores, alongside mostly luxury flats, office spaces and an upcoming cinema and ice rink. After the grand opening, a five-day free festival of live music will take place on the site. Emma and Marcus Liberman, a married couple from north-west London, decided to travel down for the centre’s opening after decades of speculation regarding what would become of the former industrial station. “When we first came to London, there were plans for redeveloping the power station about 30 years ago, but it never came to anything,” Marcus said. “And I’ve always looked to this amazing building, and wanted to see what it was really about, so just really wanted to come and see it.” He added: “It’s just really exciting to see it actually turned it something, being used and full of life again, as opposed to a rather sad looking, deteriorating building.” Bernice Ondebola, a 67-year-old retired nurse who has lived in Battersea for most of her life, said the new development was a “lovely sight” compared with the abandoned and derelict former station. “I grew up in south London, and have been living not too far away from the power station for the past 35 years,” Ondebola said. “In some ways the area is so unrecognisable compared to when I first started living here, with, you know, all the new flats and also the new tube. But I think the shopping centre is nice because it has a bit of everything for everyone.” Ondebola said she especially liked how the centre, despite its modernisation, has retained many of its period features. “You can really feel that you’re inside the power station, with all the exposed brick and the machinery you can see on the ceiling,” she ssaid. “The building has such a big presence in our local area so it’s nice that it has become a place that everybody can use.” Serge, a 52-year-old business owner and who has lived in London for the past 30 years, said that watching the power station transform from an abandoned building had been momentous. “I’ve seen the station abandoned, and the whole surroundings at that time wasn’t very pleasant-looking. It’s very nice to see somebody invested in the area and moved the whole project ahead”, he said. Although most people attending the opening were positive about the redevelopment, there was some concerns raised about the lack of affordable housing provided – at just 386 homes, a 40% reduction from the original plans. Alice White, a 25-year-old student, was at first sceptical when she heard of the power station’s redevelopment plans. “I know there was a lot of debate about how many of the new flats inside the station would actually be affordable,” White said. But despite still having some reservations regarding the development, White thought the centre was “quite enticing”. “I can’t lie, the range of shops and places to eat here are kind of exciting,” White adds. “I live locally, and what I’m most happy about is not having to go all the way to Westfield or Oxford Street whenever I need to make some returns at Zara.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/oct/14/erik-ten-hag-confident-manchester-united-have-enough-goal-power","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-14T12:30:37Z","webTitle":"Erik ten Hag confident Manchester United have enough goal power ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/oct/14/erik-ten-hag-confident-manchester-united-have-enough-goal-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/oct/14/erik-ten-hag-confident-manchester-united-have-enough-goal-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Erik ten Hag is confident Manchester United have forwards who will score 20 or more league goals this season but the manager also wants his midfielders and defenders to contribute. Marcus Rashford’s five goals in nine games is United’s highest tally, with Antony, Anthony Martial and Jadon Sancho each scoring three times and Cristiano Ronaldo twice. United’s only other scorer is Bruno Fernandes, who has one strike in 12 appearances. Ten Hag, asked whether he has players who can score at least 20, said: “Yes, I’m confident, mostly. In my team, there are players who will score. They come into the [scoring] position and in the last part [of the field]. It’s also about the freedom from the player, the intuition, the space they have to take. When they have that feeling then you will see that with their talent they will score that number. “You can also divide it, because we have many goalscorers across the offensive department. But we also need something from midfield and the defensive department.” Rashford’s buildup play sparkled in Thursday’s 1-0 Europa League victory against Omonia Nicosia though his finishing disappointed. “He did a lot of things well but finally he knows that he has to be more clinical and he has to score a goal,” Ten Hag said. “When you have such good movements and make such good combinations, good actions, then you have to finish. I know sometimes it’s the game, it’s not your night and it’s about the form of the day but it can change in another game. “He’s in a really good run, that shows in the chances he creates. Now it’s in the last two games he’s been a little unlucky. On Sunday [at Everton] he deserved a goal but they cancelled it [for a handball]; today he didn’t score. I say save it for the coming week.” United host Newcastle on Sunday, then Tottenham on Wednesday before Saturday’s visit to Chelsea. “These are real tests for us as a squad to go into battle,” Ten Hag said. “And it delivers energy. Newcastle do really well. It’s a team who can play in high intensity with a lot of energy and that makes it a tough opponent. We know we have to play our best.” In midfield Ten Hag can choose from Scott McTominay, Christian Eriksen, Casemiro and Fred. He is yet to settle on his best combination. “It’s difficult to say in this moment,” he said. “They have to play longer together but what’s important is that we need a squad. Fred played a good game [against Omonia]. We have some combinations and in the midfield it’s always about balance. I’m happy with all four and hope they keep going this way.” Martial faces a fitness test but Harry Maguire’s hamstring requires more time to heal. “Next week he’ll be back in training or after next week,” said Ten Hag."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/26/a-fresh-era-for-india-or-a-ham-fisted-ego-trip-welcome-to-modis-new-seat-of-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-26T08:00:14Z","webTitle":"A fresh era for India or a ‘ham-fisted’ ego trip?

No one quite knows when, except perhaps for the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and those close to him, but it has been imminent for months. There were suggestions that it would open in time for the 75th anniversary of Indian independence last year, but the high steel hoardings around it remain in place. The £120m project is at the centre of a culture war. For Modi and his supporters it is a statement of freedom from colonial legacy, and a poke in the eye for the old governing class of New Delhi. It is the centrepiece of the Central Vista Project, an ambitious plan to make over the city’s British-built administrative centre. Critics of the new building say that it is an unnecessary replacement of the existing parliament, that short cuts were taken with its procurement and the obtaining of permissions, and that there was minimal consultation with parliamentarians and the public. Opposition MP Jawhar Sircar calls the project “an extension of Modi’s virulent ego and his desperate need to make a mark for himself”. Madhav Raman, a Delhi-based architect, says its design is “ham-fisted” and “awkwardly stuck together”. Both dispute the official arguments put forward for the new building, that India’s expanding population requires a larger debating chamber than the parliament now offers, and that its 96-year-old home is worn out. “I find it perfectly all right,” says Sircar. “In India we have buildings that are 500-700 years old and still work well.” New and old parliaments stand side by side among the grandiose array of public buildings designed and planned by the architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker about a century ago, after the British government decided to move the capital of the Indian empire from Kolkata to Delhi. They are laid out around a huge central axis, somewhat like the Mall in Washington DC, stretching 3km from the domed Viceroy’s Palace – now the Rashtrapati Bhavan or Presidential Palace – to the India Gate, an arched memorial to the country’s dead in the first world war. Intended to symbolise and reinforce permanent British rule, the complex served its original purpose for only 16 years, from its inauguration in 1931 to Indian independence in 1947. Since then it has been the place where the country’s democratic government was forged. For some, though, it represents what a pro-Modi commentator calls an “old hierarchical elite”. The term “Lutyens gang” is used to denigrate Jawaharlal Nehru and the Congress party politicians who negotiated independence with the British, and their successors. Modi, in the style of populist authoritarian leaders worldwide, presents himself as a disrupter of this old order, even as he imposes his own hierarchies. His Central Vista Project envisages rows of new government buildings on either side of Lutyens and Baker’s central boulevard and a £47m new prime minister’s house, as yet unbuilt. A black granite statue has been erected by the India Gate of Subhas Chandra Bose, the nationalist leader who, more militant than Nehru, befriended Nazi Germany and imperial Japan in his efforts to find allies in his struggle against the British. The boulevard, once called Kingsway, then the Rajpath – according to Modi a “symbol of slavery” – was last year renamed the Kartavya Path or “road of duty”. The new parliament is by the architect Bimal Patel, from Modi’s home state of Gujarat. Its design is not, in fact, quite as hostile to Lutyens and Baker’s architecture as some of the prime minister’s rhetoric might suggest: while the plan is a triangle with its corners shaved off, in geometric contrast with the circular shape of the older parliament, its exterior is in pink and cream stone similar to that of its neighbour. It combines repeating vertical pillars in the style of classical architecture with motifs from traditional Indian buildings. What critics dislike is what they see as the poor quality of the new design, as well as the fact that more than 300 trees were removed to make way for the new parliament, and an open space built over. Raman calls the use of traditional details on the new building “cookie cutter … they could have been taken from a catalogue in China”. If Modi’s grand projects are meant to represent a proud modern nation, is the suggestion, they are not doing a very good job. “What inspiration is it supposed to give you?” asks Sircar. The interiors will look somewhat hotel-like, albeit with two large debating chambers for the two houses of parliament, with decoration inspired by peacocks and lotus flowers. Patel has declined to comment. More fundamentally, opponents of Modi question the need to remake the British architectural legacy. The journalist Harish Khare has called the renaming of the Rajpath an “extraordinary foray into historical spuriousness”. Raman believes that Indians should be “proud” of the “mature” way that governments after independence turned the imperial buildings to the purposes of the new democracy. Sircar similarly argues that the heritage of past rulers should be respected. “Otherwise,” he says, “why don’t you tear down the Taj Mahal?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/02/cubans-protest-over-power-outages-four-days-after-hurricane-ian","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-02T09:52:27Z","webTitle":"Cubans protest over power outages four days after Hurricane Ian","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/02/cubans-protest-over-power-outages-four-days-after-hurricane-ian","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/02/cubans-protest-over-power-outages-four-days-after-hurricane-ian","fields":{"bodyText":"Four days after Ian, a category three hurricane, protests have sprung up at different points in Cuba over the lack of electricity after the storm. Alex Bandrich, 35, a graphic designer with his chihuahua, Richi, in hand, was at a protest with more than 100 people on a main road of the well-heeled Vedado neighbourhood on Saturday night. “I haven’t had light in my house for the last five days,” he said. “I’ve lost food, although I kept some at a friend’s place [with power], and I’ve had to take my daughter to my mother-in-law’s place.” Given the stress that people without power are under, the atmosphere at the Vedado protest was calm. Police didn’t interfere with the protest, there were no arrests. Instead, the state opted to send officials, accompanied by party members, to talk with protesters. María Perez, who identified as a regular citizen, said she had come to talk to protesters to defend “the revolution”. “Every time I think the social project that we have created is in danger, I will be here,” she said. Still protesters’ tactics were creative, creating a quandary for the state: there were reports that people lined up in the street to block traffic outside the capital’s main baseball stadium; in east Havana, others put rocks outside a bus station, saying they wouldn’t allow transport to run until the power came back. State authorities say that power – which went out across Cuba after Hurricane Ian – was mostly back in the capital as of Friday afternoon. Since the hurricane, protests have also been reported in the western city of Matanzas and the eastern city of Holguin. On Thursday and Friday night there was no internet in Cuba. It was not clear whether this was coordinated by the government in order to make protests more difficult to organise (as has happened before) or whether the internet blackout was a result of power failure caused by the storm. The internet was mostly functioning Saturday night. The Cuban government regularly tries to distinguish between “legitimate” protests by upstanding citizens, and “counter-revolutionary” protests, typically backed by the US, which imposes sanctions on the country. While the former is enshrined in the country’s 2019 constitution, the government says it will not tolerate the latter. The distinction, however, often breaks down in practice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/17/penny-wong-and-paul-keating-spar-as-minister-warns-against-frenzied-taiwan-war-speculation","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-17T08:05:20Z","webTitle":"Penny Wong and Paul Keating spar as minister warns against ‘frenzied’ Taiwan war speculation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/17/penny-wong-and-paul-keating-spar-as-minister-warns-against-frenzied-taiwan-war-speculation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/17/penny-wong-and-paul-keating-spar-as-minister-warns-against-frenzied-taiwan-war-speculation","fields":{"bodyText":"Penny Wong has warned politicians and media against playing “the most dangerous of parlour games” by adding to “frenzied” speculation about a war over Taiwan. The Australian foreign affairs minister said on Monday that such a conflict would be “catastrophic for all” and there would be “no real winners” – but the warning was quickly overshadowed by a fresh war of words with Paul Keating. Wong hit back at the former Labor prime minister, who ridiculed the minister for “running around the Pacific islands with a lei around [her] neck handing out money”. “I think in tone and substance he diminished both his legacy and the subject matter,” Wong told the National Press Club in Canberra, adding that Australia had a clear interest in a peaceful, stable region. Keating gave his latest retort two hours later, saying Wong had spoken in platitudes about keeping the balance of power but had “not a jot of an idea as to how this might be achieved”. In a statement on Monday, Keating said Australia was “straddling a strategic divide, a divide rapidly becoming every bit as rigid” as seen in Europe in 1914 at the outbreak of the first world war. “Australia’s major foreign policy task is to soften that rigidity by encouraging both the United States and China to find common cause and benefit in a peaceful and prosperous Pacific. Nothing Penny Wong said today, on Australia’s behalf, adds one iota of substance to that urgent task.” Wong’s speech focused on the need for all countries to “exercise our agency to avert war and maintain peace” at a time when the Indo-Pacific region faced “the most confronting circumstances in decades”. Wong said Australia did not want great power competition between the US and China to “career into conflict”. In the wake of Nine newspapers’ controversial “Red Alert” series – which warned of the risk of war within three years – Wong said there was “much frenzied discussion in political and media circles over timelines and scenarios when it comes to Taiwan”. “Anyone in positions like mine who feels an urge to add to that discussion should resist the temptation,” she said. “It is the most dangerous of parlour games.” Wong said Australia stood against any unilateral change to the status quo over Taiwan, and opposed the threat or use of force or coercion, because this was “the proposition most capable of averting conflict and enabling the region to live in peace and prosperity”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In the speech, without naming Keating, Wong took aim at “some” who implied that “we should attach ourselves to what they anticipate will be a hegemonic China”. She named Robert Menzies and John Howard as examples of “those throughout Australia’s history who have thought our foreign policy should simply be to attach ourselves to a great power”. But she said the Albanese government would “always be more ambitious for Australia” and pursue greater self-reliance. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan, a self-governed democracy of 24 million people that Beijing claims as a wayward province. Earlier this month China engaged in three days of military drills near Taiwan in what it called a “stern warning” after Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, travelled to the US and met the house speaker, Kevin McCarthy. Wong said the job of the Australian government was to “lower the heat on any potential conflict, while increasing pressure on others to do the same”. “That may not sell as many newspapers today, but it will help you to sell them for a lot longer,” she said. She said Australia shared “the objective of a world that is free of nuclear weapons” but refused to give a timeframe on Labor meeting its platform commitment to sign and ratify a landmark new UN treaty. Wong acknowledged one of the reasons more than 90 counties had now signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) was because of “frustration that there has been insufficient progress” towards disarmament. “If this can spur more progress in that arena, that is a good thing,” she said. “We set out very transparently in the party platform our consideration of that treaty.” The platform commitment was subject to a number of conditions, including the need to work to achieve universal support for the TPNW, but at present the nuclear weapons states, including the US, oppose the blanket ban. Wong confirmed, though, that the US had given an assurance that the American submarines to visit Australia on increased rotations from 2027 would be conventionally armed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/11/reactor-ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-shut-down-operator","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-11T17:28:49Z","webTitle":"Putin and Macron trade blame over risk at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/11/reactor-ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-shut-down-operator","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/11/reactor-ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-shut-down-operator","fields":{"bodyText":"Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel Macron have traded blame over safety concerns at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, which has been a focal point of fighting in recent weeks. Separate readouts of a phone call between the French and Russian presidents highlighted the difficulties in trying to find an accord to ensure safety at the site. “The Russian side drew attention to regular Ukrainian attacks on the plant’s facilities, including radioactive waste storage, which is fraught with catastrophic consequences,” said a statement published on the Kremlin’s website. It called for a “non-politicised interaction” on the matter with the participation of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In its statement, the French presidency said the occupation by Russian troops of the plant was what was putting it at risk. “He [Macron] asked that Russian forces withdraw their heavy and light weapons and that the IAEA’s recommendations be followed to ensure safety at the site,” the Elysee said. Earlier, Ukraine’s nuclear power operator said the last operating reactor at the plant had been shut down and the plant “completely stopped”. The six-reactor Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from the grid last week after all its power lines were disconnected as a result of fighting in the area, and was operating in “island mode” for several days, generating electricity for crucial cooling systems from its only remaining reactor in operation. Energoatom, the state-run operator of all four of Ukraine’s nuclear power stations, said one of the power lines was restored on Saturday night, allowing plant operators to shut down the last reactor. “A decision was made to shut down power unit No 6 and transfer it to the safest state: cold shutdown,” the operator said. Electricity supply to the plant has been cut with increasing frequency over the past few weeks, including at least three times last week. Energoatom said the risk of continued damage to the supply line “remains high” and that it did not want to risk the plant being powered by diesel generators, “the duration of which is limited by the technological resource and the amount of available diesel fuel”. The plant was disconnected from the Ukrainian grid for the first time in its history on 25 August. Energoatom has called for a demilitarisation of the plant by Russian forces, who took control of the area in early March. On Friday the IAEA, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, said the situation at the plant was increasingly precarious, after its offsite electricity supply line was cut again. Russia and Ukraine have traded blame over shelling of the plant and the nearby area. Ukraine claims Russia is carrying out attacks as part of a false-flag operation to blame Ukraine. Russia blames Ukraine’s forces. Researchers and journalists have pointed to some evidence that supports part of Ukraine’s claims. However, the Guardian has not been able to independently verify events at the power plant. Rafael Grossi, the IAEA’s director general, warned last week that Ukraine was considering shutting down the plant because it “no longer had confidence in the offsite power”. Grossi did not apportion blame for the shelling of the plant. Grossi said that if Ukraine decided not to restore the offsite supply, the entire power plant would be reliant on emergency diesel generators to ensure supplies for nuclear safety and security functions. “As a consequence, the operator would not be able to restart the reactors unless offsite power was reliably re-established,” he said.

The Ukrainian president arrived in Hiroshima on a French government plane on Saturday to discuss greater military support from the US and other G7 countries as his forces prepare for a huge counteroffensive in the war with Russia. Sunak noted that the G7 had once been the G8, before Russia was expelled in 2014 for its illegal annexation of Crimea and “flagrant abuse of human rights and the rule of law”. He added: “Nine years on, it sends an incredibly powerful message to have my friend and Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy with us in Hiroshima today. It tells the world that the G7 stands united with the people of Ukraine, in the face of a terrible onslaught. And it demonstrates that brute force and oppression will not triumph over freedom and sovereignty. “I am delighted that the G7 has agreed on the importance of giving President Zelenskiy the advanced military equipment needed to win this war and prosper as a free and democratic nation.” UK sources said it was Sunak’s suggestion Zelenskiy should come to the G7 to make his case in person, adding that he had made this proposal in a phone call about a month ago. Sunak’s official spokesperson said: “It is an opportunity for President Zelenskiy to address a lot of world leaders in one place at a time when western leaders are aligned.” In his first face-to-face meeting with Narendra Modi, who has called for a ceasefire but not condemned Russia, Zelenskiy briefed the Indian prime minister on Ukraine’s peace plan, which calls for the withdrawal of Russian troops from the country before negotiations can start. Zelenskiy later said he had asked Modi to help implement the peace plan. “I spoke about Ukraine’s needs in humanitarian demining and mobile hospitals,” Zelenskiy tweeted. “I thank India for supporting our country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, in particular, at the platforms of international organisations, and for providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine.” In their final communique – released a day earlier than expected – the G7 leaders reaffirmed their support for Ukraine. “Russia’s brutal war of aggression represents a threat to the whole world in breach of fundamental norms, rules and principles of the international community,” it said. “We reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes to bring a comprehensive, just and lasting peace.” Zelenskiy’s arrival in Hiroshima comes a day after the White House announced it would permit allied countries to supply Ukraine with US-built F-16 fighter jets. Before leaving for Japan, Zelenskiy described the decision ashistoric, adding that he looked forward to “discussing the practical implementation” with G7 countries. The White House said Joe Biden was looking forward to meeting Zelenskiy at the summit, with the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, saying it was a “safe bet” that the pair would meet. “The president looks forward to the opportunity to be able to sit down face to face,” he said. With the US veto on F-16s lifted, Sunak announced that Britain would work together with the US and the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark to get Ukraine the combat air capability it needs. Japan is the farthest Zelenskiy has travelled to make the case for more military aid, and comes after visits to Italy, Germany, France and Britain. He was in Saudi Arabia to attend the Arab League summit before heading to Hiroshima, where he is expected to take part in two separate sessions on Sunday – one with G7 members and another focusing on “peace and stability” with non-G7 countries taking part in the Hiroshima summit. That will give him a rare opportunity to speak to the leaders of powerful non-aligned countries, including Brazil, who have declined to condemn Russia’s invasion. Amid concerns over Russia’s refusal to rule out the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Zelenskiy is expected to visit a museum devoted to the horrors of the US atomic bombing of Hiroshima in August 1945 and a memorial to the hundreds of thousands of people who died as a result of the attack. In their communique, the G7 leaders said they were committed “to achieving a world without nuclear weapons with undiminished security for all, through taking a realistic, pragmatic, and responsible approach. We reaffirm the importance of disarmament and non-proliferation efforts to create a more stable and safer world.” The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons condemned the statement as a rehash of proposals that had “failed to deliver progress over the past three decades”. “They did not announce any new, concrete measures,” it said in a statement, adding: “What is needed from the G7 is responsible leadership to respond to the acute danger that nuclear weapons could be used in conflict for the first time since 1945, but rather than this, we heard criticism of Russia, North Korea and China which, while justified, evaded the G7’s own responsibility for the current threat nuclear weapons pose to everyone.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/14/west-plans-avoid-panic-if-russia-nuclear-bomb-ukraine-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-14T17:26:30Z","webTitle":"West makes plans to avoid panic if Russia uses nuclear bomb in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/14/west-plans-avoid-panic-if-russia-nuclear-bomb-ukraine-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/14/west-plans-avoid-panic-if-russia-nuclear-bomb-ukraine-putin","fields":{"bodyText":"Western officials are engaged in “prudent planning” behind the scenes to prevent chaos and panic in their home countries in the event Russia was to detonate a nuclear bomb in or near Ukraine. Although a nuclear crisis is considered highly unlikely, the insider said officials internationally were re-examining plans to provide emergency support and reassurance to populations fearful of nuclear escalation. Hints of the thinking emerged in a briefing by an official on Friday, who was asked if there would be measures in place to prevent panic buying or people fleeing cities en masse in fear of escalation after a nuclear event. Governments were engaged in “prudent planning for a range of possible scenarios” said the western official, who was speaking on condition of anonymity, although they stressed that any use of nuclear weapons by Russia in the war would be abhorrent. Public information campaigns and even school drills on how to survive a nuclear war were a feature of the cold war, including the duck and cover campaign in the US in the 1950s, Protect and Survive from the UK in the late 1970s and “Everyone has a chance” in West Germany in the early 1960s. These campaigns were the subject of considerable criticism and parody for their suggestion that it could be possible to survive an all-out nuclear conflict, although in this case the focus is supposed to be on preventing public panic over fear of an uncontrolled nuclear escalation that would lead to major cities being targeted. Kate Hudson, the general secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, said: “This ‘prudent planning’ harks back to the British government’s cold war-era Protect and Survive campaign – which was roundly condemned by CND as giving the false impression that a nuclear attack could be survived by whitewashing windows and other irrelevances.” As Moscow has suffered reverses on the battlefield in Ukraine since September, Vladimir Putin has ratcheted up the nuclear rhetoric, saying last month that he would use “all available means” to defend Russian territory. The western official said the Russian president’s comments about nuclear use were “deeply irresponsible” and no other country was talking about nuclear weapons. “We do not see this as a nuclear crisis,” they said. Echoing comments made by the US, the official said: “Any use of nuclear weapons would break a taboo that has held since 1945” which would “lead to severe consequences for Russia, as well as for everybody else”. Towards the end of last month, Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, said there would be “catastrophic consequences” for Moscow if it sought to deploy a tactical nuclear weapon, which can have the power of six or seven Hiroshima blasts. The west does not want to spell out how it might respond, to preserve a deliberate ambiguity – and on Friday the official would not be drawn on what nuclear armed countries might do. But the expectation is that to avoid rapid escalation any initial response would be non-nuclear. On Thursday, Emmanuel Macron broke ranks and said he would not order a like-for-like retaliation if there was a Russian nuclear strike in Ukraine. The French president said the country’s fundamental interests “wouldn’t be directly affected at all if, for example, there was a ballistic nuclear attack in Ukraine, in the region”. Earlier this week, Jeremy Fleming, the head of the GCHQ spy agency, said he not seen any sign that Russia was preparing to use a tactical nuclear weapon in or around Ukraine. It is his agency’s job to help monitor Russian military movements, and whether its military was trying to pair a nuclear warhead with a conventional missile. Experts generally believe that Putin is engaged in a bluff, trying to provoke fear and uncertainty in the west, to ensure that the US or Nato does not enter the war on Ukraine’s side."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/nov/16/the-ghost-variations-by-damian-lanigan-review-the-power-of-the-piano","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-16T11:00:18Z","webTitle":"The Ghost Variations by Damian Lanigan review – the power of the piano","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/16/the-ghost-variations-by-damian-lanigan-review-the-power-of-the-piano","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/nov/16/the-ghost-variations-by-damian-lanigan-review-the-power-of-the-piano","fields":{"bodyText":"Early in The Ghost Variations, the third novel by Damian Lanigan, the narrator approaches a woman in a bar to ask her a question: “Would you mind if I played the piano a little? I’ll be quiet. And I’ll be good. I’ll be quietly good.” Quietly good: the phrase aptly describes this accomplished book about love, grief and the constraining and consoling effects of art. Declan Byrnie grew up in a family with Irish roots in working-class Manchester, but his prodigious gifts as a classical pianist transported him to a lavish world of concert halls and oligarchs’ homes. He was at the height of his fame when his wife, Esther, died in mysterious circumstances during a hiking trip; bereft, he disappeared from the music scene for four years. We meet Byrnie as he prepares for what, having been coaxed by his agent to perform again before adoring audiences and a prurient media, he sardonically calls the “Dead Wife Tour”. Byrnie’s sense of loss suffuses his whole worldview. Now a New Yorker, he spends his evenings rotating between “four or five bars in Upper Manhattan with instruments I can use, a rust belt of these old machines, remnants of a world becoming derelict”. He tells an interviewer: “I think it’s obvious we’re close to losing all this stuff” – that is, the historical repertoire of piano music – “which would be a tragedy … We wouldn’t stand by if St Paul’s Cathedral were being dismantled before our eyes. If the Uffizi were on fire, someone would try to put it out.” Initially, Byrnie attempts to douse the flames of his own loss through the simulacrum of intimacy offered by casual sex: “Women are curious about gifted men, and upon this fact I continue to rely.” Byrnie is no predator, and Lanigan undoubtedly intends us to view his protagonist’s erotic exploits through a tragic lens. But the descriptions of Byrnie’s sexual conquests occasionally cause the story to veer close to the derelict world of late 20th-century novels about male geniuses surrounded by nubile and sexually voracious young women. A long section describing Byrnie’s road trip with Elise, a woman 10 years his junior, would have benefited from less flesh – Elise spends most of her time in a bikini – and more fleshing out of character. A myopic protagonist can be an asset to a novel: take The Unconsoled, Kazuo Ishiguro’s great work about a dementia-afflicted concert pianist, a clear influence here. In that book the reader is constantly aware of the distance between the narrator’s perceptions and the reality beyond them. But I was struck by the occasional bum notes in Lanigan’s prose as he describes the endlessly available women around Byrnie – “her wet blue eyes, her mouth, pouty and mobile … I occasionally ascend into thoughts of its hot slitheriness”. By contrast, The Ghost Variations is usually pitch-perfect when it describes Byrnie’s enduring passion and the novel’s core theme: music. Lanigan writes eloquently about both the exhilaration and mundanity of a musician’s life, the euphoria of the audience’s applause and the “tedious, arduous, repetitive, ugly work” of practising. And he is convincing in his portrait of a man for whom the piano is both an obstacle to human contact (“the composers … never disappoint like real people”) and ultimately his means of redemption. But it’s in the difficult work of translating the medium of music to that of prose that Lanigan most excels. A Chopin Berceuse sounds like “starlit water games”. Byrnie plans to play Beethoven’s Hammerklavier Sonata with “an almost meditative expression, as if the music was resolved before it began, its end present in its beginning, so any sense of narrative or struggle would be needless”. Bach offers “a view of the cosmos as explicable and morally correct, constellations turning in rhythm over the imperfect world, a presiding power observing and forgiving”. As I read, I found myself reaching for my headphones to experience the pieces this novel describes so beautifully, the music enhanced by Lanigan’s words and vice versa.

Roger Shepherd, a local record shop manager, had given the band $50 to make a record that would kickstart his new label called Flying Nun. Over only a few hours in a makeshift studio in the back of a house, the Clean recorded Tally Ho!, a song that the journalist Russell Brown said “starts stopped hearts”, and which rocketed up New Zealand’s singles chart. It was a single that turned the country’s music industry on its head. A band from South Island had made a song for next to nothing, released it on a local independent label and everyone loved it. Overnight Flying Nun was transformed into a legitimate label and the Clean became sensations with a sound that would reach around the world. Hamish Kilgour had started the Clean two years earlier with his brother David on guitar and vocals. The brothers had grown up in the small rural communities of Cheviot and Ranfurly before they moved to Dunedin in the early 1970s. Inspired by a local proto-punk outfit, the Enemy, led by Chris Knox, and 60s acts including the Velvet Underground, the Kilgours formed the Clean. The Velvet’s Mo Tucker had a particular impact on Hamish Kilgour; he taught himself to play the drums miming along to the Velvet’s What Goes On from their 1969 live album. Early on it was tough going for the Clean, and local pubs showed little interest in them. But when the bassist Robert Scott joined the group in 1980, everything clicked. They quickly became one of the best live bands in the country. Garage fanzine’s editor, Richard Langston, described it as a sound that just “swamped over you … with that pulsing dirty metallic pop”. And though records like Tally Ho! and the follow-up Boodle Boodle Boodle EP were big sellers that helped finance label Flying Nun’s catalogue for several years, they also reconfigured common perceptions of how a record could be made. With the help of Chris Knox and Doug Hood, the Boodle EP was made in an old Auckland hall with just a four-track, yet songs like the Hamish-sung Point That Thing Somewhere Else sounded stunning despite being relatively lo-fi. From the outset, Kilgour was strikingly independent and constantly looking for new inspirations to fuel his music and to challenge expectations. “The music business is a business and it’s dollars and cents, charts, units and product, which is totally divorced from what I believe in,” he told Rip It Up in 1982. “Music inspires you. It makes life more enjoyable … You have to keep experimenting and remain open to things.” These sentiments carried through to every band he played in. In mid 1982, while the Clean had two EPs riding high in the charts and they were playing to packed audiences, they suddenly announced they were breaking up. There was no infighting or drama, everyone in the band simply felt burnt out and uninspired. After the Clean split, Kilgour started another band with David – the Great Unwashed, a name that seemed to refute everything that came before it. Hamish’s idea for their first tour was to load up a van and visit holiday towns. He was committed to reaching the unreached. But when one of their tracks was played by John Peel and UK tastemakers took an interest in Flying Nun bands, Kilgour was hesitant to seize on the hype. “I wouldn’t think of going over there in terms of chasing success,” he said. Instead, the Great Unwashed fell apart and Kilgour went on to start another seminal band, Bailter Space, with Alister Parker of the Gordons. Kilgore dusted off an old Clean favourite, I’m in Love With These Times, for their great first EP, but again it wasn’t long before he felt the urge for something different. When Bailter Space headed over to New York to play a prominent industry showcase, Kilgour opted not to travel back to New Zealand following the gigs. New York became his home for more than 20 years. He arrived in the US just as it was becoming apparent how much the Clean had rubbed off on many of the bigger bands in the underground scenes. Groups such as Pavement and Yo La Tengo showed a clear debt to the Dunedin trio, and the former even covered the band’s song Oddity. It was a perfect time for the Clean to get back together, starting with some reunion shows in 1988. But rather than tour and thrash out old favourites, Kilgour and his bandmates remained steadfast about making new music that challenged both themselves and their fans. This started with their first full-length album, 1990’s Vehicle, which featured some of his best vocal work for the Clean. Several other standout albums followed, many of them featuring artwork by Kilgour, including the covers of Modern Rock and Getaway. With members split between New Zealand and New York, the Clean were never a constant, and it gave Kilgour time to pursue other projects. He released several records with his band the Mad Scene alongside his then partner Lisa Siegel, and also issued two inspired solo records All of It and Nothing and Finklestein. While back in New Zealand he got together with old friends Paul Kean and Kaye Woodward of the Bats, and Alec Bathgate of Tall Dwarfs to form the Sundae Painters, who released a single in 2021 and had more records in the works. With Hamish, the music never stopped. He was enlivened with the idea of constantly exploring where his art could go, and filled with the hope that this would inspire others do the same. In a statement after his death, the Clean’s US label, Merge Records, said Hamish had “produced one of the most important and timeless bodies of work in rock music” and as a drummer had a “instantly recognisable style and an understated power”.

The timing, on the morning of Joe Biden’s speech to the UN general assembly aimed at rallying support for Ukraine, demonstrates that, to some extent, Putin’s announcements are about news management – to seize the agenda with tenuous claims that Russia is threatened by Nato “nuclear blackmail”. That helps cover up the fact that the mobilisation – of about 300,000 Russians with military experience, according to Sergei Shoigu, the country’s defence minister – is a measure that will take months to have any meaningful military impact. If, that is, Moscow can obtain anything like that number at all, given Russia’s ongoing difficulties in recruitment and retention. Resignation letters written by Russian troops exhausted by months of fighting following the recapture of Izium illustrate the point, although the decree announced by Putin also makes clear soldiers on short contracts are now barred from leaving the frontline until the war is over. “Operationally, this won’t make any difference this year and probably not into next year,” said Ed Arnold, who works for RUSI, a thinktank. “The infrastructure isn’t there in terms of equipping that level of force at the moment. Russia has a 1000km frontline to hold, and it is worried about its rear areas. It wants to hold the area it has.” In military terms, the Kremlin should have taken the mobilisation decision months ago. Exact figures are hard to come by, but Ukraine may well have more troops available than Russia now. And as the Kharkiv region offensive showed, Kyiv can marshal fresher troops against areas of the front it has been able to identify as thinly held. Kyiv continues to have a window of opportunity before the late autumn muddy season, starting in November, which limits manoeuvre for armoured vehicles. That is long before any reservists are likely to arrive. Recognising that, last Friday the US announced a further $600m of military aid to Ukraine, including more Himars rockets that have so damaged Moscow’s logistics and its ability to resist. It is a flow of aid that Russia is desperate to halt, but has no military ability to do so. Targeting Nato distribution hubs in Poland is not a viable option, given Nato’s security guarantee. Moscow clearly lacks the intelligence to destroy supplies in meaningful quantities as they head to the frontline, or it would have done so in the way that Ukraine has been able to. But Putin, by reinforcing warnings that nuclear weapons will be used “if the territorial integrity of our country is threatened”, will hope to sow uncertainty in the eyes of policymakers’ meetings in New York – perhaps to limit supplies from countries reluctant to allow Ukraine to have certain weapons, such as ATACMS long-range missiles, fighter jets or western tanks because of their offensive capability. The Kremlin also needs to retain what support it has left from its flagging allies – even Putin acknowledged China’s president, Xi Jinping, had “questions and concerns” following a bilateral last week – and argues that Nato is effectively engaged in a war against it. Shoigu emphasised, in an interview on Wednesday, the west’s supply of satellite intelligence and weapons against Moscow’s forces. It is no secret that Nato members (but not Nato itself) are providing military support to Ukraine but there is no existential threat to Russia; the goal, Biden said on Wednesday, was for the war to end “on terms we all signed up for, that you cannot seize a nation’s territory by choice”. There is the question of whether Russia will try to argue territories it annexes are covered by its nuclear umbrella – but attacks on Crimea, seized unilaterally in 2014, have not prompted any escalation from Moscow. The precursor of Putin’s interventions remains Russia’s unexpected defeat on the battlefield earlier this month. The nuclear sabre-rattling is designed principally to produce uncertainty and fear in the west, while the belated mobilisation can only help improve Moscow’s prospects from next spring, when the war is most likely to enter a decisive phase. But it also gives time for Ukraine to prepare too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2022/nov/25/talking-horses-bank-on-improving-our-power-to-lift-newbury-gold-cup-horse-racing-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-25T16:40:33Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: bank on improving Our Power to lift Newbury’s Gold Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/nov/25/talking-horses-bank-on-improving-our-power-to-lift-newbury-gold-cup-horse-racing-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2022/nov/25/talking-horses-bank-on-improving-our-power-to-lift-newbury-gold-cup-horse-racing-tips","fields":{"bodyText":"The first running of Newbury’s most historic handicap chase in its new guise as the Coral Gold Cup is one of the most competitive renewals this century, with no fewer than five horses top-priced as 8-1 co-favourites on Friday morning and four more a point behind on 9-1. Remastered, a faller four out when going like the winner 12 months ago, may prove to be the pick of the market leaders, but despite the strength and depth of the field, it is a surprise to find Our Power (3.05) at a double-figure price a little further down the list. Sam Thomas’s seven-year-old was steadily progressive last season and put up a new career-best to win the London Gold Cup at Ascot in October, posting an excellent time in the process. Our Power remains unexposed beyond three miles, is proven on good ground and is an excellent bet at around 12-1 to give both Thomas and Sam Twiston-Davies, his jockey, a first win in this race. Newbury 1.20 Paul Nicholls had Kapcorse – who carries the famous colours of the late Sir Peter O’Sullevan – ready to win this race run in O’Sullevan’s memory first time up last year and a 6lb rise in the weights may not be enough to prevent a repeat performance. Newcastle 1.35 Malinello has a long absence to overcome on his chasing debut but Ben Pauling has an impressive record with horses returning from a layoff and the seven-year-old’s brief hurdling career in 2020-21 suggests his opening mark is more than fair. Newbury 1.55 Lightly-raced mare West Balboa has excellent prospects of making a winning handicap debut off 127 having finished within seven lengths of Stage Star in last year’s Challow Hurdle over track and trip. Newcastle 2.10 Seven days later than planned, Constitution Hill returns to action with at least a stone in hand of his field on Timeform’s ratings and anything other than a third Grade One win from four starts over hurdles will be one of the shocks of the season. Newbury 2.30 Nicky Henderson has two runners as he looks for a third win in this race in four years and Theatre Glory, an impressive winner off an 8lb lower mark at Kelso in March, could be the pick of them with useful conditional Nathan Brennan taking off 7lb. Newcastle 3.25 A tough assignment for L’Homme Presse, last season’s Brown Advisory Novice Chase winner at Cheltenham, as he returns to action in a handicap off a mark of 164. At the likely odds, Into Overdrive looks a better bet at around 4-1, as he gets 22lb from the favourite and has the benefit of a run this season. Newbury 3.40 Amarillo Sky has returned in excellent form and should follow up his recent win at Cheltenham’s November meeting. Champ beats Paisley Park in thriller Champ and Paisley Park, the veterans in a five-horse field, produced a memorable finish to the Grade Two Long Distance Hurdle at Newbury on Friday, with Champ holding the late charge of his fellow 10-year-old, Paisley Park, by a neck ahead of what is likely to be a rematch in the Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot in three weeks’ time. Champ set out to make all the running under Jonjo O’Neill jnr and looked set for a straightforward success as Paisley Park came under pressure on the run to the second-last. The former Stayers’ Hurdle winner kept finding more for Aidan Coleman, however, and the gap between the two horses was down to less than two lengths at the final flight. They were separated by the width of the track as Paisley Park continued to eat into Champ’s lead all the way to the line, but Nicky Henderson’s runner had just enough in the tank to get over the line. “Our old boy has won an RSA Chase over fences and everybody adores him,” Henderson told Racing TV afterwards. “He’s got the most lovely character and he’s such a sweet horse. AP [McCoy] rode him in a gallop here 10 days ago and he thought he was in great form, but he does have his ailments as well. He’s a bit creaky, like all of us at that age. “You could see we were travelling and Paisley Park was off the bridle, but you can never write him off. You can never read Paisley Park, he might stand still at the start and still come and beat you. He’s a bizarre character, but he’s a phenomenal horse with a phenomenal team and I’m sure we’re going to meet again in three weeks’ time.” Henderson was completing a double after Jet Powered’s impressive 11-length success in the card’s novice hurdle, a performance which saw the five-year-old installed as an 8-1 chance for the Supreme Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham in March. The card’s Grade Two novice chase, meanwhile, produced a surprise as Sebastopol, the 22-1 outsider of four runners, stayed on strongly to beat Paul Nicholls’s Stage Star, the 2-7 favourite, by five lengths."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/25/much-of-ukraine-without-power-heat-and-water-after-missile-attacks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-25T14:44:41Z","webTitle":"Much of Ukraine still without power, heat and water after missile attacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/25/much-of-ukraine-without-power-heat-and-water-after-missile-attacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/25/much-of-ukraine-without-power-heat-and-water-after-missile-attacks","fields":{"bodyText":"Much of Ukraine remained without electricity, heat and water two days after a devastating series of Russian missile attacks against the country’s civilian infrastructure. The Kyiv mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said 60% of households in the city of 3 million had no power, and there were rolling blackouts around the country, as engineers struggled to repair transformers and transmission lines damaged or destroyed by cruise missiles on Wednesday. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said basic utilities were gradually being restored, but there were problems with water supplies in 15 regions. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said Russian strikes on critical infrastructure had killed at least 77 people since October. “Millions are being plunged into extreme hardship and appalling conditions of life by these strikes,” said Türk in a statement. “Taken as a whole, this raises serious problems under international humanitarian law, which requires a concrete and direct military advantage for each object attacked.” The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, did not deny that Russia was attacking Ukraine’s energy infrastructure but blamed Kyiv on the grounds it had not bowed to Russian demands, which he did not specify. Zelenskiy’s government has vowed not to accept peace terms that leave Russia in control of any Ukrainian territory. In his nightly address on Thursday, Zelenskiy said the attacks would not break the will of the Ukrainian population. “Together we endured nine months of full-scale war and Russia has not found a way to break us, and will not find one,” he said. The three nuclear power stations still under Ukrainian control were back in operation after an unprecedented complete shutdown on Wednesday. However, Petro Kotin, the head of the state nuclear energy company, Energoatom, told the Guardian that defects in turbogenerators meant that two reactors were not yet rejoined the power grid. Kotin did not say where the two affected reactors were. Kotin said that in the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which remains under Russian control, two of the six reactors were in standby mode, but had not yet been returned to the grid. Russian forces have continued to shell the southern city of Kherson two weeks after withdrawing their troops to the other side of the Dnipro River. Ukrainian citizens being evacuated from the city because of the complete destruction of electricity, heat and water systems, have come under artillery fire as they attempt to leave. According to the Ukrainian presidency, 11 people were killed and nearly 50 injured in the Kherson region on Thursday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/20/vladimir-putin-escalation-ukraine-nuclear-war-annexation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-20T18:19:10Z","webTitle":"Is Vladimir Putin happy to risk nuclear war to avoid admitting defeat? | Andrew Roth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/20/vladimir-putin-escalation-ukraine-nuclear-war-annexation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/20/vladimir-putin-escalation-ukraine-nuclear-war-annexation","fields":{"bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has backed himself into a corner in Ukraine. And true to form, the Russian leader is ready to escalate, perhaps up to the brink of nuclear war, rather than admit defeat. Seven months after Putin launched his invasion, Russian troops have been driven back in the Kharkiv region, and Ukrainian forces are advancing in Luhansk and squeezing his troops and supply lines in Kherson. It is not impossible that Russia could lose territories that it has held since 2014 if Putin’s forces cannot stop Ukraine’s counteroffensive. Facing humiliation, Putin has issued a new threat: holding “referenda” in the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, which could lead to them being annexed by Russia by early next week. In the mind of Russia’s formalistic leader, that would turn the “special military operation” in Ukraine into a defensive war in Russia, opening up the possibility of a full mobilisation, declaration of war and even a nuclear strike. Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of the state-owned broadcaster RT and a vocal lobbyist for the war, said: “Judging by what is happening and what is about to happen, this week marks either the threshold of our imminent victory or the threshold of a nuclear war. I can’t see any third option.” There is little doubt that Russia’s plan – holding sham referenda to annex Ukrainian territories and threaten a massive military escalation – is just blackmail. Ukrainians were quick to recognise it as an attempt to halt the counteroffensive. “Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them whatever Russia has to say,” said Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister. But since February, it has become clear that few actually understand the depths of the Kremlin’s mania over Ukraine or Putin’s willingness to waste the lives and welfare of Russians, as well as his own legacy, in order to exert his will over his neighbour. The Kremlin’s strategy is fraught with risk. New annexations could further undermine Russian control over territories such as Crimea, by convincing Ukraine and the west that Moscow is delivering empty threats and reducing hesitation at retaking territory formally annexed by Russia. So is the latest threat an ultimatum meant to save Russia from defeat? Or is Russia ready to go all the way? Both are perhaps true. If Ukraine and western supporters blink (which is unlikely), Putin will be happy, analysts say. If not, well, whatever comes next is not our fault, the Kremlin thinks. Alexander Baunov, a Russian political analyst, wrote: “Moscow’s actions, therefore, are being taken to either end the war as soon as possible or, if that doesn’t work, to put the blame for that on other people and turn Russia’s invasion of a neighbouring country into a defensive war. “Moscow hopes that that distinction will make the conflict more legitimate in the eyes of ordinary Russians, leaving the Kremlin free to make whatever decisions and take whatever measures it deems necessary.” Putin has sometimes been called an expert in the strategy of “escalating to de-escalate” – averting conflict by threatening a massive retaliation. But Putin does not seem to want to de-escalate. A more apt description of his strategy may be “win or escalate”. And as Simonyan puts it: Russia is going all in."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/oct/09/battersea-power-station-redevelopment-wilkinson-eyre-a-giant-that-needs-no-grand-gestures","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-09T10:00:55Z","webTitle":"Battersea power station: a giant that needs no grand gestures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/oct/09/battersea-power-station-redevelopment-wilkinson-eyre-a-giant-that-needs-no-grand-gestures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/oct/09/battersea-power-station-redevelopment-wilkinson-eyre-a-giant-that-needs-no-grand-gestures","fields":{"bodyText":"The first thing that hits you is the scale. Have so many bricks ever been piled up like this anywhere else? It’s a cliff, a behemoth, a Babylonian monolith. Up close, you keep recalibrating your sense of proportion, like a confused camera lens, not quite believing what you see. Crowded though it is by high, dense, profit-seeking apartment blocks, they can’t shrink Battersea power station. The next thing you might notice is the bravura of its original architects, Giles Gilbert Scott and J Theo Halliday: the four pale chimney columns that carried nothing but plumes of smoke; the muscular hunching of its masonry; the insistent flutings and striations of its art deco, faintly Maya, ornament. There’s a play of rough and refined that continues inside, into its two old turbine halls, where pillars clad in handmade faience carry girders of much-riveted steel. There are two glorious control rooms – the 1930s version (Control Room A, a private events space) contains batteries of dials and knobs with a crystalline glazed ceiling worthy of an ocean liner’s ballroom; the 1950s Control Room B – a bar – offered a more futuristic proto-Tardis. Battersea power station is industry made civic. It’s a carbon-belching brute turned national monument that once burned 240 tons of coal per hour and electrified 20% of London, before entering a long retirement as the backdrop of album covers, films, fashion shoots and the everyday life of the capital. Also as the country’s biggest heritage problem, passing through British, Chinese, Irish and Malaysian owners, and numerous proposals by leading architects and consultancy teams, each trying to work out how to make a commercial proposition out of the expensive-to-fix hulk, which nonetheless was listed Grade II*. It was built in two phases, from 1929 to 1935 and from 1937 until wartime interruption in 1941, finally completed in 1955, and progressively decommissioned from 1975 to 1983. Then it was to be a theme park, and after that various combinations of retail, leisure, residential and office development. At one point there were to be Cirque de Soleil acrobats swooping over surprised shoppers from its high roofs; at another, a 300 metre-high “eco-dome” was to be built just outside the power station. In 2012, Chelsea Football Club proposed making it into a 60,000-seat stadium. Meanwhile, the condition of the building, left roofless after the failed theme park plan, became more and more parlous. It therefore spent more than 25 years working to full capacity, compared with the near 40 it has taken, until its reopening this month, to find a new use. The final answer to the question – how do you solve a problem like Battersea? – turns out to involve more than 100 shops, restaurants and cafes, a 1,400-person events venue, 254 apartments (more than £1m for a studio flat, £18m for a six-bedroom penthouse), plus more than 500,000 sq feet of office space, most of which has helpfully been taken by Apple. Those big apartment blocks on the station’s 42-acre site have helped the finances stack up, as has the 2012 decision by the then chancellor George Osborne to underwrite a nearby extension to London Underground’s Northern line with public money. The power station’s commercial desirability also benefits from proximity to Vauxhall and Nine Elms, where a riot of residential towers has gone up around the new American embassy. The conversion, by the architects Wilkinson Eyre for the consortium of Malaysian investors who now own the building and its surrounding site, is sober, especially compared with the histrionics of previous proposals. There’s a lot of angular black steel, riffing on the building’s industrial heritage, with respectful restoration of the fancy faience and the gorgeous control rooms, plus some memories of its former ruination – patches of knackered masonry and rusty metal left exposed; spidery steelwork holding up the fragile, cathedral-size window at its southern end. Occasional quirks, such as unusual angles arising from irregularities in the original structure, help stop the new architecture becoming too po-faced, and there are outbreaks of cautious fantasy, such as a hanging glass room that can move up and down and sideways with the help of the building’s old gantry crane. The biggest gee-whizz moment will be a lift up one of the 109-metre-high chimneys, with a panoramic view of London at the top. The design’s general restraint makes sense. When you’re dealing with something as magnificent as Battersea power station, one of those rare buildings that can properly be called an icon, who needs attention-seeking from the new stuff? Wilkinson Eyre’s work also helps the building hold its own against the shopping – retail has a way of swamping spaces with the generic glitz of glass balustrades and bright lighting, and by demanding that nothing gets between consumers and products. Here the architecture wins: the handsome old pillars, for example, come firmly down to earth, with shop units fitted between them. The architects’ sensible approach doesn’t work so well with the new apartments, which are fitted into parts of the power station’s perimeter and stacked up on its roofs, looking on to gardens high off the ground. Here, the normality of the architecture doesn’t do justice to the fact that these mews in the air are actually abnormal, while their glass walls make for awkward intimacies between the shared gardens and private interiors. The situation here is extraordinary, but the design seems to wish it wasn’t. The restoration of the power station has come at a cost. The decades of desperation and site-flipping have driven down some of the public benefits that might have come with a development this size, and pushed up the amount of profitable floor space. Successive owners argued that they couldn’t possibly afford to save the historic building without significant concessions from the planners. Thus provision of affordable housing, on a site just off that of the power station development, is 9%, which compares with 15% allocated in the 2010 planning application and the 50% that was aimed for by policy at the time. The Northern Line extension, before Osborne’s intervention, was to have been funded directly by the developers. The surrounding blocks were permitted at a height where they obscure the historic building from several directions, which is definitely not desirable in planning terms. You could certainly wish that Wandsworth borough council and the London mayoralty had been more robust in their planning negotiations with present and past owners of the site. The project as whole also creates a highly managed territory of the sort that you tend to get in single-owner developments which, despite some funky moves by a Frank Gehry-designed apartment block, is fundamentally predictable. It threatens to cage the beast that is Gilbert Scott’s masterpiece, as might the array of retail logos inside. But, between the blandscape outside and the brandscape within, the power station is cussed enough to assert its own character. Yet it is still a cause for celebration that one of the most remarkable buildings of the 20th century has been saved and that its interiors, for the first time, are open to the public. Its eventual survival demonstrates, among other things, the relative strength of heritage in British planning – normal commercial logic and standard considerations of value for money give way to the needs of the monument. Which, in relation to Battersea power station, is welcome. It stands in striking contrast to the visual and spatial anarchy down the Thames at Vauxhall and Nine Elms. If only some of the thoughtfulness applied to old buildings could be applied to the planning of new ones, we might be getting somewhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/10/gchq-head-putin-making-strategic-errors-ukraine-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-10T21:00:31Z","webTitle":" GCHQ head: Putin making strategic errors due to unconstrained power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/10/gchq-head-putin-making-strategic-errors-ukraine-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/10/gchq-head-putin-making-strategic-errors-ukraine-russia","fields":{"bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has made strategic errors in his pursuit of the war in Ukraine partly because there are so few restraints on his leadership, the head of the British spy agency GCHQ will say in a speech on Tuesday. Russia’s soldiers are running out of supplies and munitions and initial gains made by Moscow are being reversed, Jeremy Fleming is expected to add in a rare public address. “Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machine spouted, it’s clear that Ukraine’s courageous action on the battlefield and in cyberspace is turning the tide,” Fleming will say. Focusing on the Russian president directly, Fleming is expected to say that “with little effective internal challenge, his decision-making has proved flawed” and that he has engaged in “a high-stakes strategy that is leading to strategic errors in judgment”. On Monday, Moscow launched a wave of missile strikes aimed at Kyiv and other major urban centres, killing at least 11 people, which Putin said was in response to the weekend bombing of the bridge connecting occupied Crimea to Russia. Western intelligence has repeatedly emphasised how it believes that Putin has micromanaged the conduct of Russian forces in the seven-month-long war. Last month US officials said it was thought the president had rejected a request from his generals to retreat from the city of Kherson on the west of the Dnieper River. But although intelligence officials believe there is increasing anxiety within the Kremlin at the progress of the war, Putin’s position is thought to remain strong. In the unlikely event he was to be suddenly replaced it is not certain it would result in a significant change in Russian strategy, either. The GCHQ director will highlight the costs to Russia from the months of fighting, arguing that Moscow’s forces have become exhausted and its recent mobilisation of conscripts shows signs of desperation. “We know – and Russian commanders on the ground know – that their supplies and munitions are running out,” he will add. Fleming is also expected to speak about the future threat posed by China, according to a pre-released extract of the remarks he will make in front of a specialist audience at the Rusi thinktank on Tuesday afternoon. Beijing’s efforts to exploit the control and surveillance capabilities in emerging technologies represents “a threat to us all” that must be tackled by concerted western action, Fleming will say, reflecting a widely held intelligence view that it is China rather than Russia that is the long-term challenger to the west. Characterising the situation as “a sliding doors moment in our history”, Fleming warned that in particular China was seeking to control or influence technologies such as satellite systems and digital currencies in line with its authoritarian politics and, where possible, spread them internationally. Beijing has been seeking to launch a central bank digital currency in an attempt to boost the use of the yuan in international transactions. But Fleming said it could be used to allow China to “partially evade the sort of international sanctions currently being applied to Putin’s regime in Russia” if Beijing were to attempt to invade Taiwan. The spy chief also highlighted China’s promotion of its own BeiDou satellite navigation system, an alternative to the US GPS and the EU’s Galileo. “Many believe that China is building a powerful anti-satellite capability, with a doctrine of denying other nations access to space in the event of a conflict,” Fleming will say, adding: “There are fears the technology could be used to track individuals.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/01/russias-wagner-group-have-as-much-power-in-kremlin-as-ministers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-01T18:25:50Z","webTitle":"Russia’s Wagner Group ‘have as much power in Kremlin as ministers’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/01/russias-wagner-group-have-as-much-power-in-kremlin-as-ministers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/01/russias-wagner-group-have-as-much-power-in-kremlin-as-ministers","fields":{"bodyText":"The leaders of the Wagner Group, the Russian mercenary group answerable to Vladimir Putin, now have as much political influence in the Kremlin as the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, a prominent Russian dissident and former political prisoner has told a British parliamentary group. Mikhail Khodorkovsky told the foreign affairs committee that Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman who finally admitted in September 2022 that he had founded the group, had as much access to Putin as the formal government officials. He said Prigozhin was behind the recent appointment of General Sergey Surovikin to head the military operation in Ukraine and was working in close conjunction with him in Ukraine. Wagner Group’s popularity in Russia had surged in recent months since it was able to argue that its existence acted as an alternative to wider mobilisation, Khodorkovsky said. However, he added that the Wagner Group, with only roughly 7,000 forces, would not take the blame if the military operations failed in Ukraine, since the Russian forces are 150,000 to 200,000. The two that will take the blame will be Yury Kovalchuk, Putin’s financier and Shoigu, the men believed to have most often pressed Putin to launch the invasion and predicted Kyiv could be seized in three days. Khodorkovsky accused Putin of using mercenary forces such as the Wagner Group, which often recruits people from prisons, because it allowed him to lie, deny responsibility and implement an illegal foreign policy. “They are engaged in terrorism and killing”, he said, adding the UK and other countries had been too slow to proscribe the group as such despite its clear “terrorist” activity in Africa. Restarting troop conscription would be a very dangerous political decision for Putin, Khodorkovsky said, adding that resistance to the mobilisation had forced him to bring the process to a premature end. He claimed 700,000 people had left Russia after the mobilisation and said this represented “a serious blow to Putin’s defence industry and for the economy of Russia”, potentially a more significant blow to Russia’s economy than any normal sanctions imposed by the west. Khodorkovsky urged the UK to take in many of these Russian exiles saying: “These people are the most active and educated people with certain financial means including 30,000 Russian programmers mainly based in Cyprus. It has significantly hit Russia’s ability to pursue the cyber war.” Similarly, he said many Russian engineers needed for the reproduction of high-precision weapons had left the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2022/oct/11/elon-musk-denies-report-he-spoke-to-putin-about-use-of-nuclear-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-11T22:38:36Z","webTitle":"Elon Musk denies report he spoke to Putin about use of nuclear weapons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/11/elon-musk-denies-report-he-spoke-to-putin-about-use-of-nuclear-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2022/oct/11/elon-musk-denies-report-he-spoke-to-putin-about-use-of-nuclear-weapons","fields":{"bodyText":"Elon Musk has denied a report that he spoke to Vladimir Putin, including about the potential for using nuclear weapons, before floating a peace plan that suggested that Ukraine cede territory to Russia. The head of the Eurasia Group political risk consultancy, who made the original claim, had insisted that his source was Musk himself. “Elon Musk told me he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine,” Ian Bremmer said in a tweet after Musk’s tweeted denial. “He also told me what the kremlin’s red lines were. “I have been writing my weekly newsletter on geopolitics for 24 yrs. I write honestly without fear or favor and this week’s update was no different.” In a newsletter for Eurasia Group subscribers, Bremmer wrote that the Tesla CEO told him Putin was “prepared to negotiate”, but only if Crimea remained Russian, if Ukraine accepted a form of permanent neutrality, and Ukraine recognised Russia’s annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Such conditions would represent near-total Ukrainian capitulation at a time when their forces are on the offensive. In the newsletter, first reported by Vice News, Bremmer said Musk claimed to have been told by Putin that those war aims would be achieved “no matter what”, including the potential use of a nuclear weapon if Ukraine retook territory in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. Bremmer said Musk told him that “everything needed to be done to avoid that outcome”. On 3 October, Musk provoked worldwide outrage by tweeting a proposal along similar lines, suggesting that Crimea was essentially Russian, and that sham referendums in four other occupied Ukrainian provinces should be redone under UN supervision, with Russia leaving only if they lost the vote. He suggested Ukraine would pledge long-term neutrality and guarantee the water supply to Crimea. Musk put the proposals to an online vote, in which they were rejected. They were given prominence in Russian state media, but derided in Ukraine. The country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, conducted a tongue-in-cheek poll of his own on “which Elon Musk” readers preferred: the one who supported Ukraine, or the one who supported Russia. Musk denied having talked to the Russian leader before floating his ideas. “I have spoken to Putin only once and that was about 18 months ago. The subject matter was space,” he said on Twitter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/apr/07/ansel-adams-photography-exhibition-san-francisco-nature","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-08T05:00:14Z","webTitle":"Powerful Ansel Adams show centers his love for nature – and the peril it’s in","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/07/ansel-adams-photography-exhibition-san-francisco-nature","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/07/ansel-adams-photography-exhibition-san-francisco-nature","fields":{"bodyText":"From towering granite monoliths to textured tree trunks, Ansel Adams’s renowned black and white photographs have offered generations the chance to see the beauty and importance of nature through his eyes. Now a new exhibit at San Francisco’s de Young fine arts museum gives viewers a new way to connect to the artist himself. Ansel Adams in Our Time, on display from 8 April through 23 July, brings together more than a 100 of Adams’s works alongside 23 contemporary photographers who reflect and build on it. The exhibition also returns Adams to the city where he launched his career and continues the conversations he began about conservation and national parks in his first exhibition at San Francisco’s de Young museum nearly a century ago. The exhibition will include some of Adams’s most famous works, including a photograph of Half Dome under the moon and a beloved self-portrait featuring the artist’s shadow – complete with his arm extended to the sky, light meter in hand – against a rock face in Monument Valley. Alongside, the gallery walls will also portray perspectives from new artists whose photos build on Adams’s work while seeking broader reflections on the natural world and the way people engage and impact it. These include collages created by Mark Klett and Byron Wolfe, who layer photographs from Adams and others over more modern captures, leaving viewers with panoramic views of Yosemite through time. Catherine Opie’s photographs sharply contrasts Adams by casting similar subjects in a colored blur while CJ Heyliger, the exhibit’s youngest artist, showcased beauty in the mundane by focusing on details in landscapes less sought after, like glass scattered across the desert. “It is great to see contemporary photographers taking up his legacy and looking at it, criticizing it, and finding new ways to approach these problems that Adams was addressing in his photographs years ago,” said Sarah Mackay, an assistant curator for the show. ‘Ahead of his time’ A master technician, Adams stewarded his images through an arduous photographic process, starting with lugging large cameras up steep terrain, enduring long waits for good light, and finally the metered dance – set to the beat of the metronome he once relied on as a musician – of darkroom development that granted him ultimate control over the final outcome. But in his writings and recordings, Adams credits his impact not to his technique, but to his eye. “The whole world is, to me, very much ‘alive,’ all the little growing things, even the rocks,” Adams once wrote. “I can’t look at a swell bit of grass and earth, for instance, without feeling the essential life – the things going on – within them,” he said. “The same goes for a mountain, or a bit of the ocean, or a magnificent piece of old wood.” His work has taken on renewed urgency as the iconic locations he photographed across the American west – including Death Valley, Grand Teton and Yosemite – grapple with a changing climate. Positioning Adams’s work alongside that of contemporary environmental artists offers visitors a new framing of the climate crisis and the importance of conservation. “The thing I find so exciting is realizing how ahead of his time Ansel Adams was in terms of thinking about these issues,” said Karen Haas, lane senior curator of Photographs Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Adams is perhaps most associated with Yosemite national park, and his images of its sweeping views and soaring granite slabs through the seasons helped shape the park’s identity while it in turn shaped him as a photographer. Armed with what he called the “spiritual-emotional” connection to the park and other wild landscapes, Adams’s portrayal helped ensure the national parks would remain protected places. In 1975 he took his message to the White House, gifting President Gerald Ford with a print of Yosemite. “Now, Mr President, every time you look at this picture,” he urged, “I want you to remember your obligation to the national parks.” National parks in peril Today those parks remain cherished but also in peril, caught between the pressures of extreme weather and surging tourism. Photography that spurred appreciation for the wilderness has also helped flood these areas with footsteps. Growing crowds and tourist-catering amenities are increasingly at odds with conservation efforts as parks push past their capacity. Adams saw the problems unfolding even in his time and often resisted what he called “resortism” in the parks and their development for public use. In his images he typically erases signs of people to offer a more pristine view of the landscapes. “We see Ansel Adams photographs and we don’t see them peopled,” Mackay said. “He is in some instances removing them from his photographs.” Yosemite – one of the most visited parks in the nation – is a quintessential example of the difficult balancing act between enabling access and ensuring the lands are preserved for generations to come. The past year has put the extreme seasonal swings that Yosemite faces on full display. In summer the park was shrouded in smoke from nearby wildfires, followed by a winter of snowstorms that closed down the park for weeks and damaged the winding mountain roads leading into the valley. The curators feel strongly that Adams would have had a perspective to share about how these issues have unfolded. That’s why, they said, including new artistic voices has elevated the potential for impact. “It’s bleak realizing how little has changed and how much work we still have to do,” said Haas reflecting on the enormous scale of problems posed by a warming world. But, she added, the exhibit has brought her hope, with its potential to both inspire awe and action. It’s a feeling she hopes viewers share. “With this exhibition we can finally put this great master in conversation,” she said, “and let these contemporary figures show us the concerns that continue today.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"guardian-masterclasses/2023/feb/02/detail-and-description-a-creative-writing-masterclass-with-jem-poster-and-sarah-burton","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-masterclasses","sectionName":"Guardian Masterclasses","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-02T16:12:54Z","webTitle":"The power of detail and description: A creative writing weekend with Jem Poster and Sarah Burton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2023/feb/02/detail-and-description-a-creative-writing-masterclass-with-jem-poster-and-sarah-burton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/guardian-masterclasses/2023/feb/02/detail-and-description-a-creative-writing-masterclass-with-jem-poster-and-sarah-burton","fields":{"bodyText":"Book now Sarah and Jem are masters in extracting lessons that inform and inspire from the readings they share and the homework of those attending.

Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said he was “extremely concerned” by reports of damage as Zelenskiy accused Russia of using the plant “for terror”. Russia’s war on Ukraine is about to enter a new phase, according to British intelligence. “The heaviest fighting [will shift] to a roughly 350km frontline stretching south-west from near Zaporizhzhia to Kherson, paralleling the Dnieper river,” the UK Ministry of Defence said. Russia is amassing troops in the south of Ukraine but the purpose of the buildup is not yet clear, UK intelligence warned. The Ministry of Defence said Russian forces could be preparing for a new assault or merely anticipating a counter-offensive from Ukraine. Ukrainian forces are focusing their targeting on bridges, ammunition depots, and rail links to affect Russia’s ability to logistically resupply in Ukraine’s southern regions, the ministry added. A foreign-flagged ship arrived in Ukraine on Saturday for the first time since the war started in February, to be loaded with grain. The Ukrainian infrastructure minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said the Barbados-flagged general cargo ship Fulmar S was in the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk and Ukraine planned to “reach the level of at least three to five vessels per day in two weeks’ [time]”. Horrific video and photos appear to show a fresh atrocity with remains of a Ukrainian prisoner of war stuck on a pole outside a house in the eastern Ukrainian city of Popasna, which was captured by Russian forces in May and is close to the current frontline in the Donbas. “There is nothing human about the Russians. We are at war with non-humans,” said the Ukrainian governor of Luhansk province, Serhiy Haidai. The head of Amnesty International’s Ukraine office has quit the human rights body in a disagreement after the group accused Ukraine’s armed forces of endangering civilians by basing troops in residential areas. Amnesty’s Ukraine head Oksana Pokalchuk said that she was resigning as she opposed the report’s publication, saying the human rights group unwittingly “created material that sounded like support for Russian narratives of the invasion”. Dozens of Ukrainian soldiers have been burned to death inside a Russian detention centre outside Donetsk, while many others face torture under a regime of “absolute evil”, a former prisoner has said. Anna Vorosheva, a 45-year-old Ukrainian entrepreneur, was trying to deliver humanitarian supplies to Mariupol when she was arrested and held on charges of “terrorism”. A European Union plan to cut gas use and help Germany wean itself off dependency on Russia will come into effect early next week, the bloc’s presidency has said. Last week, EU member states agreed to reduce their use of gas by 15% over the winter, with exceptions for some countries and despite opposition from Hungary. A Russian journalist has reportedly been arrested at the border on suspicion that she could be a spy, Kosovo’s interior minister said on Saturday. Xhelal Svecla named the journalist as Daria Aslamova. “Many countries have proven that she was engaged in espionage for Russian military intelligence and that she pretended to be a journalist,” Svecla said. An official with the Russian occupying authorities in Kherson was gravely wounded on Saturday in an attempted assassination, local Moscow-backed officials said. Vitaly Gur “is in hospital with multiple gunshot wounds, in a critical state”, an unnamed official told Russian state news agency Tass. Meta, formerly named Facebook, has removed a network of Instagram accounts operated by a troll farm in St Petersburg, Russia. 45 Facebook accounts and 1,037 Instagram accounts were removed after the report found that about $1,400 had been spent in rubles to pay for ads on Facebook and Instagram."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/31/russia-assault-on-ukraine-power-grid-is-strategy-of-nihilism","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-31T18:26:30Z","webTitle":"Russian assault on Ukraine’s power grid is the strategy of nihilism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/31/russia-assault-on-ukraine-power-grid-is-strategy-of-nihilism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/31/russia-assault-on-ukraine-power-grid-is-strategy-of-nihilism","fields":{"bodyText":"Russia’s cynical decision to target Ukraine’s network of hydroelectric power stations on Monday represents a further, dispiriting, escalation in its efforts to destroy the country’s power supply. The electricity network is reeling from three weeks of attacks focused on coal- and gas-fired power stations and, above all, the electricity substations that link up different parts of the grid. Power cuts are the new normal as winter looms. It may not be clear how damaging Monday’s attacks involving the two hydro plants on the Dnieper River and a third on the western Dniester are, but their targeting suggests Russia intends to push further in its attempts bomb Ukraine into darkness: before the war, hydro contributed about 14% of the country’s energy capacity. At the same time, Ukraine has warned that Russia has mined the Nova Kakhovka dam in the occupied south of the country and that its retreating forces may yet destroy it to cover a retreat from Kherson. Moscow has warned that Ukraine may blow up the dam across the Dnieper River, although some pro-Russian bloggers published animated maps to show how serious the disruption could be downriver. It is almost certain that Monday’s attacks will be followed up, and for all Ukraine’s claimed success in knocking out 44 out of 50 incoming missiles, the reality remains that a minority continue to get through to damage strategically vital targets. Cutting electricity supplies may have some impact on Ukraine’s military, which has a battlefield momentum that the Kremlin is desperate to halt, but it is obvious that the most serious consequences will be faced by civilians at risk of being without electricity and other utilities in a country where winter temperatures can plunge to -20C. John Lough, a Russia expert at the Chatham House thinktank, warns that “this has the potential to be very painful for the civilian population” but that it is likely “to encourage Ukrainians to dig in more and accept that Russia has chosen to victimise them and inflict the maximum pain possible”. Bombing, however terrifying, is a military tactic that has a poor record of changing hearts and minds. It was used heavily in the Vietnam war, for instance, but failed to stem the overall resolve of the North Vietnamese, and if the Russians are any students of history, they will know its limitations. But Russia probably does not care. Its strategy is also aimed at the west: a shameless attempt to prompt a fresh flow of several million migrants across the border. Ukraine has been trying to ask refugees already abroad not to return this winter to help protect the energy supply. “The networks will not cope,” said the deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, last week. At the same time, Russia hopes to increase the costs of supporting Ukraine, which imported energy from Europe on a test basis for the first time last week. Historically, Ukraine has enjoyed an energy surplus. Now it may need to buy supplies at a time when its treasury is short due to the demands of fighting Russia. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently estimated that Ukraine needs to borrow between $3bn and $4bn (£2.6bn and £3.5bn) a month to get through next year, but warned that Kyiv’s need for financial support could rise further if “social and infrastructure requirements” increase – in other words if the war damage worsens in a war that is likely to last into next year at least. Ukraine and its allies have to be braced for the longer haul, and be ready to focus on further humanitarian support, mindful of the fact that the Kremlin has embraced nihilism as its primary method of warfare. Or as Lough puts it: “If Putin can’t take Ukraine, he’ll wreck it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/02/netanyahu-poised-to-reassume-power-with-help-from-far-right-friends","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-02T12:30:13Z","webTitle":"The staying power of ‘King Bibi’, Israel’s scandal-ridden political behemoth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/02/netanyahu-poised-to-reassume-power-with-help-from-far-right-friends","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/02/netanyahu-poised-to-reassume-power-with-help-from-far-right-friends","fields":{"bodyText":"Don’t call it a comeback. Benjamin Netanyahu was booted from office last summer by a broad coalition united by their distaste for the conservative Likud leader. But after Tuesday’s election – an unprecedented fifth poll in less than four years – the short-lived “government of change” is probably going to prove no more than a brief intermission in the political behemoth’s long career. With 80% of votes counted on Wednesday, but official results not due until next week, Bibi, as he is commonly known, appears the most likely candidate to form a new government. Several small leftwing parties may yet clear the electoral threshold, erasing his rightwing religious bloc’s lead of 65 seats in the 120-seat Knesset. But even if that happens, Netanyahu still would not be out of the running. Coalition horse-trading could last for weeks, and if it failed, a sixth election would be held next year. Israel’s political crisis since 2019 was triggered by allegations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust against Netanyahu, whose last stint as prime minister lasted 12 years. He has denied all the charges in his ongoing corruption trial, but the case has polarised Israeli society. To his ardent supporters, “King Bibi” is a strong, tested leader unfairly prosecuted by a biased establishment. To detractors, his vilification of the judicial system has undermined trust in public institutions and the rule of law, paving the way for the astonishing rise of his new far-right ally, the Religious Zionist party, which doubled its number of seats. Many from across the political spectrum had hoped that the 73-year-old would eventually stop standing for the good of the politically fractured country. But it was never likely he would give up. Netanyahu’s probable success is mostly thanks to the Religious Zionists, formerly three fringe extremist parties that he persuaded to merge into one slate before the 2021 election. In doing so, he may have opened Pandora’s box. This time round, its radical ideas – expelling “disloyal” Palestinian citizens of Israel and annexing the occupied West Bank – have been greeted with enthusiasm from an increasingly rightwing Israeli public. The former prime minister insists it is nothing to do with him that his new ally has proposed sweeping changes to the penal code that would help get his trial thrown out. “Over his previous two stints in office, Bibi has preferred to form coalitions with centrist or centre-left parties, but he’s made too many enemies and broken too many promises for that to happen again now,” said Eran Amsalem, an assistant professor of communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “He’s stuck with the far right, whether he likes it or not.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/sep/28/edf-considers-extending-life-of-two-uk-nuclear-plants-due-to-energy-crisis-hartlepool-heysham","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-28T17:35:06Z","webTitle":"EDF considers extending life of two UK nuclear plants due to energy crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/28/edf-considers-extending-life-of-two-uk-nuclear-plants-due-to-energy-crisis-hartlepool-heysham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/sep/28/edf-considers-extending-life-of-two-uk-nuclear-plants-due-to-energy-crisis-hartlepool-heysham","fields":{"bodyText":"France’s EDF is considering extending the life of two British nuclear power plants due to the severity of the energy crisis. EDF said on Wednesday that it would review whether there was a case to keep open the Hartlepool nuclear power plant in County Durham and Heysham 1 on the north-west coast of England near Lancaster. Both plants had been scheduled to close in March 2024. EDF operates all of Britain’s eight nuclear power plants, five of which are still providing power to the grid, about 13% of the UK’s electricity. The entire fleet is due to shut by 2028 apart from Sizewell B, which will close in 2035. When EDF took over the nuclear fleet in 2009, Heysham 1 and Hartlepool were due to run until 2014. After technical reviews, that was extended to 2019 and then, in 2016, a further five-year extension was approved after further reviews. Sources said any extra lifespan for the stations was likely to be far shorter than previous extensions. The stations – which produce 2.2 gigawatts of power, enough to power 3.5m homes – have been operational for four decades. EDF said it had decided to launch the review “in light of the severity of the energy crisis and the results of recent graphite inspections” and said an extension would “depend on the results of graphite inspections over the coming months”. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sparked turmoil in energy markets and sent gas and electricity prices soaring. It has also caused an international dash for gas supplies and raised concerns over potential blackouts this winter. The government has moved to shore up winter energy supplies, signing deals to keep coal-fired power stations in Yorkshire and the east Midlands on standby including EDF’s West Burton A plant in Nottinghamshire. Mike Clancy, general secretary of the Prospect union, said: “The government has had no option but to keep these plants on longer term. It underlines that we need a long-term plan for energy generation. We’re a decade late on nuclear and if we don’t move fast enough we will miss the boat on other fuels, like hydrogen. The government needs to give people the confidence to invest.” Some power-generation companies, including those on nuclear, old solar and windfarm contracts have landed an unexpected windfall from the jump in electricity prices while their costs have not risen, triggering calls for a windfall tax. EDF said its nuclear fleet would generate 42 terawatt hours of power in 2022. It said that, because it had sold its output in advance, it had delivered at “well below current wholesale prices”. The Guardian revealed earlier this month that Centrica, which owns a 20% stake in the nuclear fleet alongside EDF, wants to renegotiate its electricity-generation contracts. Tom Burke, co-founder of the green thinktank E3G, said: “In the current climate it makes a lot of sense [to extend the plants’ lifespans]. The question is mainly about the cost: is the extra time you’re buying worth the cost of keeping it safe? The Office for Nuclear Regulation are not going to play fast and loose with safety so then it depends on the spend. With electricity prices where they are now it probably does make sense.” EDF said it plans to invest £1bn in the nuclear fleet from 2023 to 2025. The debt-laden company, which is being fully nationalised by the French government, is developing the delayed and over-budget Hinkley Point C project in Somerset. It is also behind plans for a sister station, Sizewell C, in Suffolk, which was given the green light in the final days of Boris Johnson’s premiership. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: “Getting the most out of our existing nuclear stations is vital to ensuring Britain has a secure supply of power going forward.” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, on Tuesday pledged to launch Great British Energy, a publicly owned energy company run on clean UK power, if elected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/07/the-rev-alan-powers-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-07T17:00:56Z","webTitle":"The Rev Alan Powers obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/07/the-rev-alan-powers-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/07/the-rev-alan-powers-obituary","fields":{"bodyText":"My brother, Alan Powers, who has died aged 81, was a Methodist minister who worked around England and in parts of the US.

He attended Severne Road nursery, infant and junior schools and Pitmaston boys’ school before gaining a place at Bordesley Green technical school in the city in 1954. He was a keen football fan – an Aston Villa supporter – and played in goal for the Bordesley Green school team, winning the league and the cup in the south Birmingham schools fixtures. On leaving school in 1957 he trained as a structural engineer in Birmingham. His interests, however, were set on church ministry with the Methodist foundation, and in 1962 he was awarded a scholarship to Richmond Theological College, University of London, where he gained a diploma in theology in 1966. In the same year he married Sheila Meredith, also from Birmingham – they went on to have two sons, Paul (known as Kingsley) and Conrad. Together, Alan and Sheila boarded the SS Groote Beer in Rotterdam, sailing to New York then travelling on to the Christian theological seminary in Indianapolis, where Alan gained his master’s degree in 1967. Before he returned to Britain he took the opportunity to use Greyhound bus services to see more of the US, and especially to visit the grave in Taos, New Mexico, of his favourite author, DH Lawrence. Alan’s ministry began in Redcar in North Yorkshire in 1967, followed by a posting to Brixton, London in 1970. In Meanwood, Leeds, he took a doctorate in ministry between 1974 and 1982. He then worked in Dover (1982-85), County Durham (1986-94) and Manchester (1994-97). His final posting was to Stockton on Tees, from 1998 to 2005. He retired to Northallerton in Yorkshire that year. In 2020, Alan and Sheila moved to Darlington to live with Conrad. He is survived by Sheila, Kingsley and Conrad, and six of his siblings. • This article was amended on 17 November 2022, to add details of further surviving family members."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/18/sudan-which-powers-are-vying-for-influence-in-vast-east-african-country","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-18T17:07:36Z","webTitle":"Sudan: which powers are vying for influence in vast east African country?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/18/sudan-which-powers-are-vying-for-influence-in-vast-east-african-country","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/18/sudan-which-powers-are-vying-for-influence-in-vast-east-african-country","fields":{"bodyText":"The conflict in Sudan is an internal power struggle, with its roots in the country’s troubled politics over recent decades. Four days of fighting has pitted army units loyal to Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of Sudan’s transitional governing sovereign council, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, who is deputy head of the council. Their power struggle has derailed a shift to civilian rule and raised fears of a wider conflict. At the same time, a dozen or more regional powers, major actors in the Middle East and geo-political heavyweights have a stake in the fighting raging in Khartoum and elsewhere. The United States, which is the biggest actor, is able to exert influence directly on key individuals, through the withholding or delivery of huge sums of aid, its weight in international forums such as the United Nations or multilateral lenders, and its ability to build coalitions of smaller powers. The US wants stability in a restive region of enormous strategic importance, and also to roll back the growing influence of competitors such as China and, to a much lesser extent, Russia. Washington welcomed the fall of the veteran dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019, but has been criticised for taking too soft a line with the two main military powerbrokers and particularly with Burhan. China has been making a major effort to win friends in east Africa through the construction of major infrastructure, economic investment, loans and support for incumbent rulers who are attracted to its brand of authoritarianism. But although China has ambitions to establish a role as a mediator of consequence across the continent, it is unlikely to have much influence on this conflict. This relative neutrality at least offers Beijing a potential opportunity to build a relationship with any eventual victor. In contrast, Russia is seen as being fully committed to Hemedti and the RSF. The former warlord has been linked to Russian efforts to extract huge amounts of gold from Sudan to help fund the invasion of Ukraine, and Moscow has deployed Wagner group paramilitaries to bolster Hemedti’s operations. Beyond the precious resources, it is Sudan’s strategic position that has attracted Moscow, particularly the chance to position a major naval base there, which would allow operations in the Indian Ocean. Egypt has longstanding ties with Sudan’s military and has made its support for Burhan clear. Egyptian soldiers – or “trainers” – have been taken captive by the RSF in recent days. Cairo wants stability and likes the idea of an authoritarian military man in charge of its vast neighbour. But it also wants the support of Khartoum in its bitter argument with Ethiopia over the control of the flow of the Nile. The Egyptians also want to check the influence of their regional rivals in Sudan. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also major actors, and their rulers have personal relationships with many of the key figures in Sudan. Both have poured huge sums of money into Sudan since 2019 in an attempt to build a regime favourable to their interests. Hemedti won favour by dispatching thousands of Sudanese fighters to fight in Yemen as part of the Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition there, but Burhan has been welcomed too. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have become much more aligned with western policy in Sudan in recent years. In recent weeks, Riyadh in particular has been active in trying to avert conflict – though without much success, it appears. The European Union is aligned with the US and the United Kingdom in seeking a compromise agreement that would lead to a transition to civilian control. Chaos in Sudan could trigger a new increase in refugees, and France is particularly concerned about the consequences for fragile states farther west where it has already lost much influence in recent years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/feb/15/wrath-and-awe-a-short-history-of-balloons-and-their-power-to-fire-up-mob-fury","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-14T14:00:18Z","webTitle":"Wrath and awe: a short history of balloons and their power to fire up mob fury | Jeff Sparrow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/15/wrath-and-awe-a-short-history-of-balloons-and-their-power-to-fire-up-mob-fury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/15/wrath-and-awe-a-short-history-of-balloons-and-their-power-to-fire-up-mob-fury","fields":{"bodyText":"On 16 December 1784 – barely a year after the first crewed flight – a British cartoonist published a sketch entitled The Battle of the Balloons, depicting airships belonging to the leading powers of the day firing cannons at each other from among the clouds. In his book Falling Upwards, Richard Holmes adduces the drawing as evidence of the intimate relationship between balloons and military competition, with, for instance, the first French company of aeronauts formed on the remarkably early date of 29 March 1794. Today we might contemplate another point Holmes makes: “Balloons are also ancient and symbolic devices [with] a long history, and a longer mythology, going back in various forms and dimensions thousands of years, to ancient civilisations in South America and China.” Perhaps that long symbolic resonance explains something about the otherwise baffling battle of balloons raging in our 21st century skies. US defence personnel now say they have downed four mysterious objects floating across America and Canada over the last week. A spokesperson for the state department blamed China for flying balloons over “more than 40 countries across five continents”; China’s foreign ministry countered by claiming to to have detected 10 US balloons in its airspace since January 2022. The US and China both control hundreds of spy satellites. These high-tech surveillance systems suck up communications data at whim, generate images so precise as to reveal details of clothing, cracks in the pavement and rubbish on the ground, and classify information in real time using the latest iterations of AI. Once launched, they’re almost impossible to circumvent – and so, for the most part, both sides respond to constant orbital scrutiny by pretending (at least publicly) that it doesn’t exist. Why, then, the sudden concern about a technology developed in the 18th century? In 1783 the Montgolfier brothers launched a balloon emblazoned with the cipher of Louis XVI, carrying skyward a sheep, duck and a cockerel (all three later hailed as “heroes of the air”) before a huge crowd at the Palace of Versailles. The display might not have saved Louis from the guillotine a few years later but it established a relationship between lighter-than-air flight and state power, reinforced when Napoleon celebrated his coronation by sending aloft a silk-draped balloon carrying a huge imperial crown on golden chains. Yet shortly after the Montgolfier demonstration, Prof Jacques Charles and the brothers Anne-Jean and Nicolas-Louis Robert launched the first hydrogen balloon in central Paris. It landed in the village of Gonesse – where the peasants destroyed it with pitchforks. If balloons could awe the masses, they could also, it seemed, enrage them. On 18 December 1856 Sydney newspapers advertised that a certain Pierre Maigre, “of aerial fame in France, US, East Indies, Mauritius and other places”, intended to “climb to the heavens” in what would be Australia’s first balloon flight. But when Maigre attempted to inflate his craft before a huge crowd of paying spectators on the Domain, the slowness of the process so bored the onlookers that, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, some “four thousand boys and youths, with yells and hootings, [went] flying after the unfortunate aeronaut, who, however, succeeded in making his escape, not exactly in so trim a guise as that in which he had appeared in public”. The crowd then began chanting, “The balloon! The balloon! Burn the balloon,” a task they soon accomplished. The Domain balloon riot (a “scene of wanton mischief such as we never wish to behold again”, the SMH said), delayed the first successful Australian flight until February 1858, when George Coppin engaged Joseph Dean and Charles Henry Brown to launch a balloon in Cremorne in Melbourne. Only two weeks later, when Brown attempted a second flight, he reported how when he descended “on the road between Collingwood stockade and Brunswick”, he was “treated in the most brutal manner by the people ascended … they tore the hair from my head, bruised, pushed and almost suffocated me, besides damaging the balloon by tugging at trampling on it”. In 1864 the famed aeronaut Henry Coxwell received even rougher treatment in Leicester, England, when rumours spread among the 50,000 spectators watching his ascent that he was palming them off with an older, smaller balloon. The crowd turned on Coxwell and, when he abandoned the flight, attacked him, chanting, according to one newspaper, “Rip him up,” “Knock him on the head” and “Finish him.” Once again the balloon was burnt, with its remains paraded triumphantly through the town. The hostility sometimes shown to Victorian aeronauts clearly stemmed from the class polarisations of the era. But the balloons themselves made tempting targets for popular wrath because of the way they combined the sublime and the profane. They soared high above ordinary men and women and yet could be so easily reduced to their flimsy, prosaic components. Perhaps there’s something similar in the current crisis. The most important spy technology remains, by its nature, almost entirely invisible. Yet, unlike a satellite, the first balloon shot down by the Americans could be seen by the naked eye – and as such provided a public, palpable focus for the tensions between the US and China. Once it became visible, escalation seemed inevitable. Holmes says ballooning enables “the most enduring early dream of flying”, which he describes as fundamentally metaphysical. “The ultimate purpose is,” he says, “to fly as high as possible, and then look back upon the earth and see mankind for what it really is.” In that spirit, what does the balloon crisis reveal? Fairly obviously, it shows that polarisation between the superpowers has reached such a level of tension that confrontations could break out over issues that no one saw coming. • Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/live/2023/may/18/royal-mail-loss-european-carmakers-post-brexit-rules-bank-of-england-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-18T15:30:35Z","webTitle":"Bank of England denies QE caused double-digit inflation; mortgage arrears and repossessions jump – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/may/18/royal-mail-loss-european-carmakers-post-brexit-rules-bank-of-england-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2023/may/18/royal-mail-loss-european-carmakers-post-brexit-rules-bank-of-england-business-live","fields":{"bodyText":"Time for a recap…. The Bank of England has rejected claims that its QE bond-buying programme is to blame for inflation soaring over 10%. In a session with the Treasury Committee, policymakers explained to MPs that it was the supply chain problems caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, and then the surge in food and energy prices after the Ukraine invasion, that drove inflation to its highest in decades. The BoE also pushed back against criticism that the unwinding of QE, called quantitative tightening or QT, could be destabilising markets. Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden liked QT to ‘descending a mountain’, rather than decommissioning a nuclear sub, arguing that the Bank wanted to be able to climb future peaks by doing more QE if necessary. There are also signs today that higher interest rates are hitting the housing market. The number of homes being repossessed and homeowners in arrears jumped in the first quarter of this year. That included a 50% increase in the number of homeowner mortgaged properties being repossessed in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the previous three months, UK Finance said. In other news: Take note, younger readers. Children’s income in the UK has risen by 11% in the last year, ahead of inflation and rather faster than average wages. The figures on children’s pocket money and earnings – part of what was claimed to be the most in-depth study of the UK’s “youth economy” – also found that six-year-olds had enjoyed the biggest “pay rise”, in the form of a 34% annual increase. Meanwhile, average earnings from babysitting leapt 24% in a year to top £20, while some savvy children were able to prise cash out of their parents for “jobs” such as making someone a coffee or smiling for a family photo. The data was based on the finances of more than 125,000 children and was collected from user activity on the NatWest Rooster Money pocket money app and prepaid debit card. Whether it was down to parents deciding to shield their children’s finances from the worst of the cost of living crisis, or an improvement in youngsters’ ability to negotiate a better financial deal and monetise small tasks, the study – based on data collected between 1 March 2022 and 28 February this year – suggested that British kids have fared a lot better financially than many adults. More here…. Shareholders in Next, the high street and online retailer, have launched something of a revolt today. Around 20% of shares were cast against chairman Michael Roney being reelected, at today’s AGM. Advisory group PIRC had recommended investors should vote against Roney, because he also chairs Grafton Group, the builders merchants. PIRC argued: “It is considered that a chair cannot effectively represent two corporate cultures. “The possibility of having to commit additional time to the role in times of crisis is ever present. There was also a protest against Next’s pay policies, with 16% opposing the remuneration report. The age of huge UK property price increases may be coming to an end, according to a senior economist at the Office for Budget Responsibility. David Miles, one of three members of the UK budget watchdog’s top committee, argues that slowing population growth slows and higher interest rates will weigh on house prices. Miles told a speech at an Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence conference in London that: “Those forces driving them up are going to be much weaker, I suspect, in the next 40 years than they have been in the past 40 years. “If anything, this unusual age of massive rises of house prices may be nearing an end.” The boss of Burberry has complained that the UK is at a “competitive disadvantage for global shoppers” which has held back sales in its home market after the government ditched a VAT tax break for tourists. Jonathan Akeroyd, the chief executive of the luxury British brand best known for its signature check and raincoats, said sales to tourists had risen 19% in London in the three months to April but they had tripled in Paris and were up 43% in Milan. He said total sales had risen 28% in the UK for the year as locals and visitors from Europe from the US, Asia and the Middle East spent more, but he noted a big surge in UK tourists spending in Europe, “which is quite telling”. Akeroyd said: “We are disappointed the government chose to scrap the VAT retail export scheme. It leaves the UK at a competitive disadvantage for global shoppers. We are celebrating the fact that we are a British luxury brand and very hopeful that when tourists come to the UK they are coming to Burberry. We are really hoping this [tax change] can be revisited.” More here: This echoes a similar warning from the chairman of Burberry last month: The pound has sagged to its lowest level since late April today, down three-quarters of a cent at $1.241. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, says the markets seem ‘unmoved’ by BoE governor Andrew Bailey’s warning yesterday about a ‘wage-price spiral’ gripping the UK. We heard from some Bank of England policymakers earlier as they were grilled by the Treasury Select Committee on quantitative tightening, among other things naturally. Bailey and colleagues were quite consistent in their messaging and it’s probably what the Governor said on Wednesday that raised a few eyebrows as he insinuated that the UK could be seeing a wage-price spiral which could complicate returning inflation to 2%. The members were still confident in their assessment despite repeated reminders of apparent past failures and markets seem unconcerned about the supposed wage-price spiral, continuing to price in one, maybe two, hikes this year. Things should become much clearer very soon. The increase in the number of households falling into early arrears on their mortgages “should not be a cause for panic”, says Sonia Fernandes, principal, mortgages at UK Finance. Writing in a blog on UK Finance’s website, Fernandes explains: “Lenders are proactively supporting borrowers who are worried about their finances. “Over the last year, lenders have helped nearly 200,000 borrowers who cannot meet their full mortgage payment by providing tailored forbearance.” Fernandes adds that borrowers can seek help as soon as they needed it: “Tailored forbearance means that a lender will offer support focused on the borrower’s individual circumstances and what they can afford to pay. “Examples of the support available includes a period of reduced payments, a period of zero payments or a temporary switch to interest-only. Importantly borrowers will never be asked to pay more than they can afford. “There is no need for a borrower to wait until they have missed a payment to seek help. Over the last year, lenders proactively supported two million borrowers with financial difficulty assistance, including budgeting support, access to debt advice and breathing space.” Over in the US, the number of new claims for jobless support has fallen. There were 242,000 ‘initial claims’ filed across the US last week, a drop of 22,000, suggesting America’s labour market is holding up relatively well. The fall comes after fraudulent claims in at least one state boosted the numbers in previous weeks, Bloomberg reports, adding: On an unadjusted basis, claims decreased by the most in two months, to 215,810, largely due to a drop in Massachusetts. Some economists have been wary about drawing strong conclusions from the data amid reports that fraudulent claims have been behind the recent upward trend in filings. Over in Tokyo, UK prime minister Rishi Sunak has announced what sounds like a hefty jump in Japanese investment into the UK. Japanese businesses have commited “almost £18 billion investment in the UK”, the government says, in a handily timed announcement as Sunak hosts a business reception in Tokyo. Much of this planned investment will be in green energy, but some will only arrive over the next decade. Japanese trading house Marubeni is planning to sign a memorandum of understanding with the UK, which envisages approximately £10bn of investment in the UK with its partners over the next 10 years. This will include offshore wind projects in Scotland and green hydrogen projects in Wales and Scotland. There’s also £4bn from Sumitomo Corporation, to expand offshore wind projects off the coasts of Suffolk and Norfolk. Political leaders do like to coral such deals together into a nice round number to mark such visits or events. Earlier this week, France hailed €13bn worth of future investments pledged by international companies at its Choose France event. Today, Sunak says: These new investments are a massive vote of confidence in the UK’s dynamic economy, from some of Japan’s top firms. The UK certainly needs a boost of spending. Business investment is still 1.4% below its pre-pandemic levels, last week’s GDP report showed. However, today’s announcement does not include new investment from Japan’s car industry, at a time when the UK auto sector is gripped by concerns over Brexit trade rules. Sunak, who is in Japan for the G7 meeting of world leaders, was asked about calls to delay new rules of origin regulations, to help the British car industry. Speaking to broadcasters on board the JS Izumo aircraft carrier in the Yokosuka naval base near Tokyo, he said: “It’s something that car manufacturers across Europe, not just in the UK, have raised as a concern. “We are engaged in a dialog with the EU about how we might address those concerns when it comes to auto manufacturing more generally.” The investment flow between Japan and the UK isn’t just one way, though. UK company Octopus Energy is to invest £1.5bn in the Asia-Pacific energy market by 2027, to speed up the shift to “a cleaner, smarter energy system”. The jump in people in arrears with their mortgage, or being reposessed, shows that rising borrowing costs and rampant inflation are battering household budgets. Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at interactive investor, explains: “The golden era of low mortgage rates has come to an end following a rapid rise in interest rates to combat red hot and sticky inflation. Almost two million mortgage holders on tracker rates have felt the brunt of each of the 12 consecutive base rate hikes as they came. Meanwhile, the uptick in mortgage rates is a kick in the teeth for mortgage holders who have come off a fixed rate deal in recent history. “There could unfortunately be a new wave of borrowers falling behind on repayments in the near future, as there are around 700,000 borrowers with fixed rate mortgages - the majority of which were set at interest rates below 2% - maturing in the second half of the year alone. However, the current low level of unemployment could slow the rise in mortgage arrears and repossessions. “The fact that buy-to-let mortgages in arrears are increasing at a faster rate than residential mortgages shows that landlords have not been immune to the cost-of-living squeeze on budgets, Jobson points out: Recent research by the ONS revealed that tenants are 4.4 times as likely to be experiencing financial hardship compared to homeowners. Missed or delayed rent payments could leave many smaller landlords in a financially precarious position. This cohort may have also seen their profit margins recede dramatically after coming off a fixed rate mortgage because of heightened mortgage costs. “Those struggling to keep up with mortgage repayments should contact their lender as their first port of call to explore their options and support available. It is worth consulting a debt advice charity such as StepChange or Turn2Us and they will go through all of your options.” Sky News is reporting that the online party goods supplier founded by the Princess of Wales’s parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, has been sold after it failed to avoid collapsing into administration. Party Pieces Holdings, launched by the Middletons in 1987, was bought on Thursday by James Sinclair, an entrepreneur, Sky says. They add: Sources said the sale had been implemented through a pre-pack administration, meaning it had appointed insolvency practitioners before being sold without some of its liabilities. It was unclear what price Mr Sinclair’s company, Teddy Tastic Bear Co Ltd, had paid or how big the liabilities were that had been left behind. Across the economy, company insolvencies in England and Wales fell by 15% in April, after rising to a three-year high in March, with companies high by higher interest rates and rising costs. The number of UK homes being repossessed and homeowners in arrears jumped in the first quarter of this year, according to figures from a trade association. There was a 50% increase in the number of homeowner mortgaged properties being repossessed in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the previous three months, UK Finance has reported today. Some 750 homeowner mortgaged properties were taken into possession in the first quarter of 2023. UK Finance said the increase in repossessions is from a very low base, as cases make their way through the courts. More households fell behind with their mortgage payments too: there were 76,630 homeowner mortgages in arrears of at least 2.5% of their outstanding balance in the first quarter of 2023, 2% more than in the previous quarter. The data also shows a rise in buy-to-let mortgages have fallen into arrears, as landlords are hit by rising interest rates rise. There were 7,030 buy-to-let mortgages where landlords were in arrears by 2.5% or more of the outstanding balance at the end of March, UK Finance reports, an increase of 16% compared to the previous quarter. Also, 410 buy-to-let mortgaged properties were taken into possession in the first quarter of 2023, 28 per cent greater than in the previous quarter. Away from the Bank of England, EasyJet’s chief executive Johan Lundgren said rival airlines were setting fares “way out of proportion”. Lundgren argues that demand means his own carrier could be set for record summer profits, our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham reports. Speaking after announcing narrowing winter losses this morning (see earlier post), Lundgren said analyst consensus suggested that easyJet would have its best ever summer financially. He said: “While it’s still early on, we’ve only sold 36% of the Q4 capacity, it’s very encouraging.” Air fares will be significantly higher this year, delighting some airline accountants, but Lundgren said easyJet would still be “providing exceptional value.” He said that the average easyJet fare for in the summer months was still £75, adding: “There are a number of legacy and full-service airlines completely pricing themselves way out of any proportion, which is giving up the opportunity to really demonstrate the value proposition that we have”. He cited research that showed 45% of people now said they were more likely to fly with a low-cost airline than before the pandemic. He said the airline had been operating well despite French air traffic strikes, with capacity already not far off summer peak, but after last year’s cancellations and disruption due to staffing issues, ““We are absolutely not complacent.” EasyJet is opening a base at Birmingham, its first new UK base in a decade, and said it will have a million more seats overall on UK flights this summer than in 2019. All these metaphors (comparing QT to climbing down a mountain) and explanations about the future direction of QE/QT are confusing everyone and blur the Bank’s message (again), warns Professor Costas Milas of University of Liverpool’s management school. He tells us that the facts are as follows: The MPC’s revised forecasts for higher inflation and output underestimate (in my view) the strength of monetary tightening already in place. Divisia money has contracted to a historically low of -3.2% in 2023Q1. This should imply lower inflation and lower GDP growth than currently predicted by the MPC (as I discuss in my co-authored European Journal of Finance paper:) Nevertheless, there is an alternative (but not very flattering) explanation. Current monetary tightening could be less effective than previously thought because the MPC (sadly) lacks credibility (as evidenced by household expectations of inflation that are consistently higher than those of the MPC). In other words, the MPC will be forced to tighten much more than what it has done in the past in order to hit the 2% inflation target… UK benchmark borrowing costs have hit the highest level since the aftermath of the mini-budget. The yield, or interest rate, on 10-year UK gilts has risen to 3.915% today, the highest since last October. That follows the suggestion from the Bank of England this morning that its quantitative easing programme could be higher next year than in 2023, implying more sales of bonds back to the market. Bond yields move inversely to prices. The Bank of England then denies that its quantitative easing programme has fuelled a surge in asset price inflation. Governor Andew Bailey tells the Treasury Committee that real asset prices have not surged under QE in the way that is often reported. Real equity prices certainly haven’t, Bailey says. Actually, the period in which the house price to income ratio rose most was the period of 10 years before 2007. That was the period when it rose most substantially. It haven’t done the same thing since then. Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden then tells MPs that investors think Britain has a bigger inflation problem than the United States. That, he tells the Treasury Committee, explains why British government bond yields have risen by more than their US counterparts. Asked why the spread between interest rates on UK gilts and German bunds, and US Treasury bills, has widened, Ramsden explains: “My take on this is that there is more of a concern about persistence of inflation (in Britain) and therefore an expectation that our short-term (interest) rate - set by us - will be higher. That feeds through into yields.” Ramsden also told the Treasury Committee that expectations of US monetary policy have also changed, with the markets starting to anticipate possible cuts by the US Federal Reserve due to problems in the US banking sector. Ramsden also reminds Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom that high UK borrowing is amother important factor influencing bond yields. The UK’s debt management office is issuing £243bn of debt this year, up from £125bn, he says, due to the fiscal interventions following the pandemic. Thirdly, Ramsden suggests that the chaos following last September’s mini-budget is still a factor, given the turmoil in the liability driven investment (LDI) pension market caused by the jump in bond yields. He says: The third factor which may explain some of those yield differentials is that there may be a bit of a risk premium, or liquidity premium, following on from the LDI episode. It may be that some of the pension funds and the like have not come back as fully into the market or they’re still adjusting, so you don’t have the same demand for some of those longer term gilts as you had in the past. That means that the price of them may be lower than it might otherwise be, so the yield is higher. Q: If monetary policy acts with a lag, as you argue, why is the Bank continuing to raise interest rates when inflation is expected to fall? That’s a question we spend hours discussing, Ben Broadbent smiles, and there’s a “range of views”. The issue is how long the ‘second-round effects’ of inflation, on wages and prices, lingers, as an interest rise today will have little impact by the end of 2023. These rate increases are “causing more pain to people out there”, says John Baron MP (who had just been arguing that rates should have been raised faster). Broadbent explains that the Bank’s forecasts are conditional on the markets’ interest rate forecasts. So if rates were cut further, inflation would be higher…. Governor Andrew Bailey says the Bank shares Baron’s concerns that inflation could be stickier than hoped, which is one reason it raised interest rates again this month, to 4.5%. The committee will return to this issue at another session next week. John Baron MP shoots back that central banks, such as the Bank of England, were behind the curve in waking up to rising inflation. Had the Bank been more proactive, there might be less pain for people today, Baron suggests. Q: A month before Ukraine, inflation was on a sharp trajectory higher at 6%, interest rates were 0.5%. Wasn’t that a woeful neglect of duty? Deputy governor Ben Broadbent point out that interest rates were low for a decade without causing a rise in inflation. There’s a distinction between causing an inflation shock, and being slow to respond to one, Broadbent insists, pointing to the enormous economic shocks from the pandemic and the Ukraine war. He explains to the committee how the pandemic led to a shift in demand for goods, globally, pushing up prices. The key question was how long that would last for – the Bank’s MPC judged that if this demand, and disruption, was caused by the pandemic, then the end of the pandemic would bring it down. That wasn’t a terrible judgement, Broadbent insists, pointing out that the price of computer chips and lumber has dropped as expected. However, the China lockdown did last longer than expected. Broadbent explains: You always have to look forward and ask yourself, how long will this continue? Baron isn’t convinced, saying it was “quite evident” that inflation, even before Ukraine, would not fall away significantly. Broadbent disputes it, citing consensus forecasts at the time were that inflation would come down. “Ah, consensus forecasts…”, says Baron dismissively. Broadbent point out that these 30 forecasts are from people who spend their lifetime doing this work. Back at Threadneedle Street, the Bank of England is rejecting claims that its quantitative easing bond-buying programme is responsible for the UK’s cost of living crisis. Conservative MP John Baron asks the BoE top brass about the link between QE and the UK’s bout of double-digit inflation. Q: You announced a large expansion of QE in 2020. Was it simply a coincidence that inflation rose from 0.3% in 2020 when you launched your final tranche of QE to over 5% by the end of 2021? Governor Andrew Bailey points out that the UK economy has been hit by several shocks, including the Covid-19 supply chain shock and the Ukraine war. They both drove up inflation, and aren’t to do with QE or QT. Bailey tells the Treasury Committee that the UK has not seen a strong recovery in demand since the pandemic, which indicates that QE is not the cause of inflation. Baron points out that UK inflation was running at 6% before the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, so “we were already on a steep trajectory”. Bailey agrees, but says the Bank was weighing up whether the inflationary shock from Covid-19 would be transitory, or not. If the only shock that the world had experienced was that one [the Covid-19 supply chain disruption] then I think the evidence now suggests it had a limited time period. Unfortunately, of course, Ukraine came along, and there was no gap between these shocks. As such, Bailey says we can’t use the word “transitory” to describe these shocks. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent points out that the UK had 10 years of QE without an inflation problem, or strong money growth, as did other regions such as the US and the eurozone [he outlined this in a detailed speech last month]. Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden tells MPs that the Bank launched more QE after the pandemic began, because it feared the economy would suffer ‘permanent scarring’. Ramsden voted to end QE early, in September 2021, as he grew more concerned about inflationary risks. But stopping QE early would have been a surprise, potentially jolting markets. And cutting QE early, by £30bn, might have taken just 0.2 or 0.3 percentage points off Uk inflation. Ben Broadbent suggests that market data indicates that the QE conducted in June and November 2021 may have added half a percentage point to UK inflation. The idea that this is the cause of double-digit [inflation] is not well-supported. Lloyds Banking Group has been forced to suspend the livestream of its AGM in Glasgow twice within the first 10 minutes, after climate protesters interrupted chairman Robin Budenberg’s opening remarks. It’s quite hard to hear what the protesters are saying, since they haven’t been given microphones and Lloyds keeps cutting out the feed, but it’s clear that they’re hitting out at the bank’s contribution to the climate crisis, through certain financial services. Budenberg has urged them to wait until the Q&amp;A segment, but to no avail, my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff reports. Climate protesters have also staged a demonstration outside of the SEC Armadillo in Glasgow, alongside staff union Unite - which is separately concerned about the company’s decision to force staff to spend at least two days a week in-office. Anyone working compressed hours will also have to negotiate new working patterns with managers. Unite has previously said the move will do “immediate and tangible damage” to work-life balance and family budgets. Q: We’ve been told that quantitative tightening is similar to decommissioning a nuclear submarine, so it has to be done extremely carefully because the potential for things to go wrong is enormous…. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent agrees that there are risks, but the Bank has taken them into account. It’s important to avoid selling bonds into illiquid markets, and to conduct QT in a very predictable, very gradual way, he explains. He tells the Treasury committee that the start of QT was delayed after the crisis in the LDI pensions market last autumn, for this reason. Broadbent says: It’s not the case that on the days we’ve sold these gilts there’s been any sort of disruption, and of course we watch for those things very closely. Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden weighs in too, disputing the ‘nuclear submarine decommissioning’ angle. He tells the MPs that the bank still wants QE to be a monetary policy tool in future. Ramsden reminds the committee that he worked in the Treasury back in 2009, when then-governor Sir Mervyn King got in touch to say the Bank wanted to start quantitative easing. It was always seen that QE would not go on for ever, there would always be some QT, he explains. He compares the bond-buying programme to mountaineering, saying the Bank’s Asset Purchase Facility has grown to a size where the Bank reached “the top of the mountain” (the APF was £895bn at its peak, but is now shrinking under QT). Ramsden says: You have to be careful going back down the other side. Because you want to be in a position that you can climb another mountain afterwards, if you have to. So you always have to be very careful on the descent. A lot of accidents happen on the descent of mountains, Ramsden points out. Treasury Committee chair Harriett Baldwin shoots back out that you also run the risk of starting an avalanche…. Q: Is the Bank of England certain that QT is not having any impact on the market? We’ve had a bank failure since you started… Is it having any inflationary or disinflationary pressures? Governor Andrew Bailey says he doesn’t see any connection between quantitative tightening and the events in the banking sector. As proof, he points out that the UK banking system has not experienced stress in recent months – the failure of Silicon Valley UK bank was a “very idiosyncratic issue”, because it was the subsidiary of a bank that failed in the US. Bailey then explains that UK banks hold £1.5 trillion of “high quality liquid assets”, of which £900bn is reserves at the Bank of England. The BoE’s QT programme should reduce those reserves, with banks looking to hold other high quality liquid assets instead. But that rebalancing should be “entirely manageable and entirely natural”, he pledges…. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent reiterates that QT is already priced into the financial markets, and those asset price levels are used in the Bank’s economic forecasts. Broadbent says the Bank can’t tell exactly what impact QT is having, because it has already announced it (so it’s priced in…). But the Bank’s best bet is that it is having a fairly modest impact, maybe just 0.1 percentage point on inflation. Q: How might the size of the Bank’s QT programme change in future years? Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden says the Bank won’t definitely plump for another £80bn reduction in its bond holdings next year. That’s because it would mean lower ‘active sales’ of bonds, given that more of the Bank’s stock of gilts expires next year. Ramsden says bank analysis will determine the pace of QT: So there’s the potential for us to go up a little bit. I don’t see us going down, given the experience of the first year. Q: Why did the Bank set a target of selling £80bn of its stock of government bonds in the first year of QT? Deputy governor Ben Broadbent says there has to be a number (!), before explaining that ‘active sales of £10bn’ a quarter, on top of the £10bn of bonds which naturally mature each quarter, felt about right. He reveals that the Bank’s market experts warned that anything over £100bn might disturb market liquidity. The important point, Broadbent explains, is that the markets have a number for QT which is ‘priced in’ to bond prices (and thus the yields, or interest rate, on those bonds). On the days of the Bank’s QT auctions, there’s been no detectible moves in bond prices, he insists. Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden denies that the Bank of England is “flying blind” with its QT programme. Treasury Committee chair Harriett Baldwin replies that the Bank is flying ‘slowly’, and reminds the Bank that the launch of QT was disrupted last autumn (due to the market chaos created by the mini-budget). Q: You announced the flight take-off, and then almost immediately had to land the plane when you started… Governor (captain?) Andrew Bailey points out that the Bank hasn’t actually begun – so it delayed the takeoff of QT, rather than returning to the runway. Bailey insists it was correct not to launch quantitative tightening operations in disturbed market conditions last autumn (the Bank waited until the start of November). And he denies that the Bank contributed to the disturbed markets, with its plan to sell some of its QT bonds back to investors. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey tells MPs that he does not believe the Bank’s balance sheet will return to its levels before the financial crisis, even once it has conducted its quantitative tightening (QT) programme. Treasury Committee chair Harriett Baldwin asks Bailey why the BoE decided last September to embark on QT – the process of cutting its holdings of government bonds bought since the 2008 crisis. [Reminder: the BoE had bought almost £900bn of UK gilts, in one programme launched after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and a second after the pandemic]. Bailey explains that the Bank wants to adjust its balance sheet so that it has headroom to do whatever it might need to do in the future. It does not want its balance sheet to simply get larger after every economic shock. But, the governor insists he does not “envisage” the BoE’s balance sheet returning to where it was before the financial crisis. The key reason is that QE has created a stock of cash reserves owned by commercial banks which sits on the liability side of the BoE’s balance sheet. There is “no question” that the banks will need to hold larger cash reserves to ensure prudential stability, and the UK is not alone in this, Bailey explains. Parliament’s Treasury Committee are starting a hearing with senior Bank of England officials now, at the Bank. MPs will grill BoE governor Andrew Bailey, and deputy governors Ben Broadbent and Dave Ramsden. The committee says Continuing its inquiry into quantitative tightening, the cross-party Committee of MPs will examine the impact of tightening on the economy, the role of quantitative easing in the outbreak of double-digit inflation, and whether tightening will bring inflation down. The government’s levelling-up agenda has taken a knock, with new growth figures showing that London was the fastest-growing part of the English economy last summer. London’s GDP grew by 0.9% in the third quarter of 2022, the ONS reports, making it the region with the largest positive quarter-on-quarter growth in Q3. The largest negative growth in England was in the East Midlands, where GDP shrank by 1.6%. Overall, the UK economy contracted by 0.1% in July-September. Wales’s economy struggled, with GDP falling by 2% in the quarter, while Scotland contracted by 0.3%. Growth in England and Northern Ireland was flat. North East England’s GDP grew by 0.7% in Q3 2022, with the South West expanding by 0.4%. All other English regions shrank. Inflationary pressures may be easing, according to the latest realtime data from the Office for National Statistics. The ONS found that 18% of trading businesses expect to raise the prices of goods or services they sell in June, down from 23% for May. More than a third (35%) of trading businesses reported an increase in the prices of goods or services bought in April compared with March; down from 38% when comparing March with February. Ovo Energy and Good Energy have been ordered to pay £4m after overcharging thousands of households on their gas and electricity bills by breaching the government’s energy price cap. The affected households will receive a combined total of £2.7m from the two companies while an extra £1.25m will go to vulnerable customers in the UK under Ofgem’s voluntary redress fund. The energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, found that Ovo overcharged almost 11,000 customers by nearly £1.5m, or an average of £181 for each household, by failing to apply the government’s energy price guarantee which sets a maximum rate for every unit of energy used between last October and March. Good Energy overcharged just under 7,000 households a total of £391,650, or about £109 on their energy bills. The suppliers will repay the amounts to their customers, and have been ordered to make extra compensation payments for the “totally unacceptable” breach to the Ofgem fund. Good Energy will pay £1.25m to the redress fund “for the inadequate systems, processes and repeated inaccurate reporting of information” over an extended period, the regulator said. More here: Luxury carmaker Aston Martin has secured a £234m investment from China’s automotive manufacture Geely, sending its shares soaring this morning. Geely is buying 42m shares from chairman Lawrence Stroll’s Yew Tree Consortium at 335p each, and will subscribe to buy another 28m at the same price. This will give Geely a 17% stake, making it the company’s third-largest shareholder behind Yew Tree (with 21%) and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (with 18%). Aston Martin says Geely’s investment is part of a “new relationship agreement” to suport its growth plan. Stroll says: “This announcement is a further significant step towards delivering our ambition for Aston Martin. Geely Holding, who initially became a shareholder last year, sees tremendous potential for Aston Martin’s long-term growth and success. They offer us a deep understanding of the key strategic growth market that China represents, as well as the opportunity to access their range of technologies and components. Geely share our vision for Aston Martin and want to be a more significant shareholder. Aston Martin’s shares have jumped 12% in early trading, the top FTSE 250 riser, to 260p. Geely’s investment comes at an important time for the car industry, as pressure mounts to reform the Brexit trade deal, points out interactive investor’s head of investment Victoria Scholar: Aston Martin is a glamorous automaker with a chequered past having survived several bankruptcies. But James Bond’s favourite carmaker has revved back into the fast lane with a pick-up in sentiment spearheading investor returns on the stock. Demand for luxury goods including cars has proven to be extremely resilient amid the cost-of-living crisis and a growing tranche of ultra-high net worth consumers. Earlier this month Aston Martin reported a narrower pre-tax loss in the first quarter of £74m versus £112m year-on-year. This investment is a welcome developed at a time when there are growing concerns about the Brexit trade deal for UK auto manufacturing. Stellantis this week sounded the alarm over potential tariffs on exports to the EU. UK auto manufacturing has come under significant pressure since the referendum with annual car manufacturing more than halving between 2016 and 2022.” Untreated sewage pollution of rivers should have been managed sooner, the water industry chair said as she apologised for industry failures. Water UK chair Ruth Kelly told Times Radio that companies did not monitor sewage outflows until recently, with only 10% overseen in 2015. Speaking after the water industry apologised for its failings, and announced a £10bn infrastructure plan, Kelly said: “We should have acted quicker. We should have acted faster. We should have acted to prevent the untreated water sewage going into our rivers and onto our beaches. “We have listened, we get it and we have come today with a plan to put this right.” Asked whether the average executive pay of £1.1m per year could be justified, Kelly poined out that 50% of CEOs would forgo bonuses entirely. She said: “Shareholders have decided they wanted to pay for some of the brightest and best people to lead the water company industry.” Kelly also told BBC Breakfast that the UK public will face “modest upward pressure” on water bills for up to a century to pay for the clean up of sewage from rivers. Musician and environmental campaigner Feargal Sharkey has said the water companies’ apology and sewers modernisation plan was “nothing to celebrate” as he said customers were left having to “pay them a second time” to clean up the country’s rivers. The former Undertones frontman told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “What I’m actually hearing is no apology for the fact we’ve paid them for a service we haven’t got. “They are now suggesting that we should pay them a second time for a service we haven’t had. BT’s job cuts also show the impact of artificial intelligence on the economy. CEO Philip Jansen says BT will use AI to improve customer service. Jansen also said the job cut target announced this morning was the culmination of an existing programme, which includes 30,000 contractors employed to build its fibre network in the next few years. He told reporters: “It’s a rolling programme, but it’s a five to seven year landing zone.” Many of BT’s planned job cuts will fall on its UK workforce. CEO Philip Jansen told a call this morning that ‘a big chunk’ will be in the UK, on the ‘build side’ of the company Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says: “BT is planning to cut 55,000 jobs by 2030 as it looks to slim down its operations and reduce its cost base. ‘A big chunk of job cuts will be in the UK’, said BT’s CEO Philip Jansen. It is targeting £3bn in cost savings by 2025. Full-year core earnings rose by 5% to £7.9 billion, in line with analysts’ expectations but BT reported disappointing free cashflow down 5% to £1.3 billion and pre-tax profits slumped 12% to £1.7 billion. Telecoms seems to be awash with job cuts at the moment with Vodafone and BT both reducing the size of their workforces. Both have been struggling with the pressures of inflation, most notably from energy. BT is focusing on digitisation and integrating AI, a shift which is likely to require fewer workers. Last year the telecoms operator was caught up in a bitter dispute with workers over wages amid the cost-of-living crisis, resulting in BT’s first national strike for 35 years. Shares in BT have fallen sharply today by over 7% and are languishing at the bottom of the FTSE 100, but the stock remains higher by just below 20% year-to-date.” Elsewhere this morning, easyJet has shrunk its losses as customers look to ‘safeguard’ their holidays in the cost of living squeeze. EasyJet reported a pre-tax loss of £415m for the six months to the end of March, an improvement on the £557m loss a year earlier. It carried 33.1 million passengers over the six months between October and March, a 41% increase on the 23.4m a year earlier. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said the airline enters the summer period “with confidence”. Lundgren explains: Recent research has shown that travel is the number one priority for household discretionary spend with customers safeguarding their holidays and increasingly opting for low cost airlines and brands which provide great value. “easyJet holidays expects to deliver full year profits of more than £80 million as it continues its rapid growth in the UK alongside its entry into the European package holiday market. From summer it will start selling holidays in Switzerland which will be the first of a number of planned new European markets. Shares in easyJet are largely unmoved, though – up just 0.15% this morning at 521p. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group, says today’s update hasn’t provided the magic to drive easyJet’s shares higher. The tone is upbeat, but now investors will want to see the airline delivering on these rosy assumptions. Given still-high inflation, some scepticism probably isn’t entirely unwarranted. In the energy sector, National Grid has reported a jump in annual profits to almost £4.6bn. The surge in earnings comes amid growing concern that it is not connecting renewable energy projects fast enough to meet the UK’s climate targets, my colleague Jillian Ambrose reports. The FTSE 100 monopoly said its underlying operating profits climbed by 15% to £4.58bn for the financial year ending in March compared with the 12 months before. This was driven by a surge in profits from its electricity distribution business which climbed by 39% from the previous year to £1.2bn for the year to the end of March. National Grid is under pressure from developers to overhaul its approach to connecting new renewable energy projects to the grid as it emerged that many will be forced to wait more than a decade for a connection. The UK plans to run its grid entirely on clean electricity by 2035 but many renewable energy projects have been told they will need to wait until the late 2030s to provide clean power to the grid. The National Grid chief executive, John Pettigrew, said: “there has never been a more exciting time to be at the heart of the energy industry”. BT has seen Vodafone’s job losses earlier this week and “taken them to another level” this morning, says Matthew Dorset, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot:. Dorset adds: “The business has faced pressure from alternative network providers, although on the retail side customer numbers have remained stable. On the Openreach side of the business BT had a net loss of 68,000 connections, a reversal of a recent trend of slowing losses. This will be a concern and a figure to watch going forward. Dorset adds, though, that BT has benefited from its price rises being linked to inflation, which led to hefty increases. “Crucially, BT has been able to maintain a competitive position in the market due to prices being inflation linked. Given competitors do the same there is no real threat of customer churn there and it should be supportive for earnings. Finally, as interest rates have risen at an extraordinary pace, the debt burden facing alternative providers will be good news for BT. While it is a business in transformation, it has a good mix of short and long-term opportunities to take advantage of.” The market isn’t very impressed with BT either. Shares in the company dropped up to 10% in early trading, the biggest faller on the blue-chip FTSE 100 index. As well as announcing up to 55,000 job cuts, BT also reported a 1% drop in revenue for the year to 31st March. Reported profit before tax fell 12% to £1.7bn, which BT blamed on “increased depreciation from network build and specific items, partially offset by adjusted EBITDA growth”. BT shares fell as low as 133.2p, from 148.1p last night, the lowest since early February. Shares in Royal Mail’s parent company are among biggest early fallers on the London Stock market, after its results this morning. International Distribution Services have dropped by 4.5% on the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies, after being pulled into a £748m full-year loss by Royal Mail’s woes. Unions are alarmed by BT’s plans to cut up to 55,000 jobs by 2030. John Ferrett, national secretary of Prospect (which represents thousands of managers at BT) says workers will be very unsettled by the announcement. “Prospect are deeply concerned by the scale of these cuts. Announcing such a huge reduction in this way will be very unsettling for workers who did so much to keep the country connected during the pandemic. “As a union we want to see the details behind this announcement in order to understand how it will impact upon members and have demanded an urgent meeting with the Chief Executive. It’s important that job cuts are voluntary, Ferrett adds: “We have always opposed compulsory redundancies in BT and has been able to ensure over the years that any reductions have been achieved on a voluntary basis. “Prospect has a partnership agreement with BT which governs how the company and the union manage change in the organisation. “We will be ensuring that the partnership agreement is fully adhered to during any consultations with BT over job reductions.” BT’s jobs cuts announcement comes just two days after Vodafone announced it would cut 11,000 positions worldwide, the largest reduction in its history. UK telco BT is planning to cut up to 55,000 jobs by 2030, as it pushes to become a ‘leaner business’. BT Group, the UK’s largest broadband and mobile provider, has declared it will reduce its workforce by tens of thousands of jobs by the end of the decade. BT says it will cut its “total labour resource” (it’s own workforce, and those employed by third parties) from 130,000 today to between 75,000 and 90,000 by the 2030 financial year. Chief executive Philip Jansen says BT will rely on a much smaller workforce, reducing its cust base, once it has completing the rollout of its new fibre broadband network. Jansen says: “By continuing to build and connect like fury, digitise the way we work and simplify our structure, by the end of the 2020s BT Group will rely on a much smaller workforce and a significantly reduced cost base. New BT Group will be a leaner business with a brighter future.” Jansen also says BT’s Openreach operation, which maintains its network, is competing strongly, and “it’s clear that customers love full fibre”. The Openreach Board has reaffirmed its target to reach 25 million premises with FTTP [Ultrafast Full Fibre broadband] by the end of 2026 and plans to further accelerate take-up on the network Despite reporting a £1bn loss this morning, Keith Williams, the chair of Royal Mail, argues there are reasons to be optimistic. Williams says Royal Mail is sorry that it hasn’t delivered a better service, and insists that the universal service obligation must be reformed. Williams tells the City: “I said before that we had reached a crossroads at Royal Mail. Now that we have a negotiators agreement with CWU that will shortly go out to ballot, and thanks to the good progress made on our five-point plan to stabilise Royal Mail, our destination is coming into sight.” “There is now a clear path towards a more competitive and profitable Royal Mail, delivering improved services for our customers whilst further reducing our environmental impact. Importantly, if ratified, the CWU agreement provides greater job security and increased rewards - through both pay and profit share - for our employees. Successful delivery of the agreement will be key.” “Quality of service has been significantly affected by industrial action and high levels of absence. I am sorry that we have not delivered the high standards of service our customers expect. Improving quality of service is our top priority.” “GLS has a proven track record of growth, solid margins and cash generation. During 2022-23 it delivered a robust performance in a tough macro-economic climate. Its flexible operating model, balanced B2C and B2B portfolio, diversified geographic exposure and continued investment have underpinned good progress this year and we continue to invest for long-term growth and margin accretion.” “So as we enter 2023-24 we have grounds for optimism. The economic climate remains challenging, and Royal Mail faces the task of rebuilding business from the damage caused by industrial action. To do this successfully and plan for the long term, urgent reform of the Universal Service Obligation is essential. Our plan is to return to group profitability this year but also seize the opportunity for both businesses to deliver ongoing profits thereafter, to the benefit of both our employees, customers and shareholders.” Royal Mail has reported a loss of over one billion pounds, after a year hit by strikes and poor delivery performance. Parent company International Distributions Services has reported that Royal Mail made a loss of £1.044bn in the year to March, down from a profit of £250m a year earlier. IDS says Royal Mail was hit by industrial action, with workers holding a string of strikes in the last year in a bitter dispute over pay and conditions. IDS blames Royal Mail’s inability to deliver “the in-year benefits of planned productivity improvements”. Weaker online shopping, and a drop in volumes of Covid-19 kits, also hit Royal Mail’s earnings compared with a year ago. IDS warns that the UK’s Universal Service Obligation (USO) – which requires Royal Mail to deliver letters six days a week to every address in the land if necessary – “requires major reform”. It tells shareholders this morning: We urge the Government to work with us to protect the long-term sustainability of the one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Service. Earlier this week, communications regulator Ofcom launched an investigation into poor performance at Royal Mail that could lead to a fine. after more than a quarter of first-class mail was not delivered on time. Earlier this year, a cyber attack forced Royal Mail to temporarily suspend international parcel and letter deliveries through Post Office branches for several weeks. The company’s international parcels business, GLS, made an operating profit of £296m, down 9.5%, today’s financial results show. But overall, IDS has made a loss of £748m, down from a £577m profit the year earlier. Last week, Royal Mail’s CEO Simon Thompson quit, after the acrimonious tussle with unions, but will stay on until the end of October. On an adjusted basis, Royal Mail made an operating loss of £419m, beating market expectations according to Reuters. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. European carmakers have joined the push to delay post-Brexit rules on where parts are sourced from, amid fears that the future of the British automotive industry is at stake. As we covered yesterday, Vauxhaul owner Stellantis, Ford and Jaguar Land Rover all called on the UK government to renegotiate the Brexit deal, to change “rules of origin” terms. Currently, electric vehicles shipped between the UK and the EU will incur a 10% tariff unless at least 40% of their parts are sourced from within the two regions. That proportion is due to rise to 45% next year, which is a problem for electric carmakers as most electric vehicle batteries are still imported from Asia. The European trade group for the car industry is calling for a delay extension to this phase-in of tougher post-Brexit trade rules. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) warns that supply chains, particularly electric vehicle batteries, are not ready. An ACEA spokesperson expained: “There has been massive investment in European battery supply chains. “The capacity to meet these rules of origin will come, but just not in the next few years. ACEA has requested that the current phase-in period for battery rules is extended by three years.” VDA, the German car industry lobby group, has weighed in in support, the Financial Times reports today. VDA said “we must urgently make adjustments” to the agreement, as Europe’s battery industry had not developed fast enough. Otherwise, they fear that tariffs would place… “a significant competitive disadvantage for the European car industry in relation to its Asian competitors in the so important UK market”. Also coming up today Water companies have apologised for repeated sewage spills and pledged to invest £10bn this decade in an attempt to quell public anger over pollution in seas and rivers. The companies will triple their existing investment plans to plough funds into the biggest modernisation of sewers “since the Victorian era” to reduce spills of overflowing sewage into England’s waterways. Industry body Water UK said the plans will cut the number of overflow incidents by up to 140,000 each year by 2030, compared with 2020. But the costs will ultimately be recouped from customers through higher bills, adding to the cost of living pressures in coming years. MPs are heading to the Bank of England to grill the central bank’s top brass this morning. The Treasury Committee plan to quiz governor Andrew Bailey on the Boe’s government bond-buying stimulus scheme (quantitative easing, or QE) and its role pushing up inflation, and how it will be unwound (quantitative tightening, or QT). Yesterday, Bailey pledged to lift interest rates as far “as necessary” to get inflation back to the bank’s 2% target. European stock markets are set to open higher, on hopes that the US debt ceiling deadlock will be broken, avoiding a US default. Joe Biden and the Republican speaker of the US House, Kevin McCarthy, said on Wednesday they thought a deal to avoid a US debt default was in reach.

Ukraine’s defence ministry has claimed Russia is planning to simulate a major accident at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to try to thwart Kyiv’s long-planned counteroffensive. The plant, in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, has been repeatedly hit by shelling that each side blames the other for. Russian forces have temporarily eased their attacks on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to regroup and strengthen their capabilities, a senior Kyiv official said on Saturday. Russia’s Wagner private army began handing over its positions to regular Russian troops this week after declaring full control of Bakhmut after the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, Reuters reported. In a statement on Telegram, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russian forces have continued attacking but that “overall offensive activity has decreased”. Russian forces have intercepted two long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles supplied to Ukraine by Britain, the RIA news agency cited the defence ministry as saying on Saturday. Reuters reports that the ministry said it had intercepted shorter-range US-built Himars-launched and Harm missiles, and shot down 13 drones in the last 24 hours, RIA reported. Defeat in its war against Ukraine would leave Russia “vindictive” and “brutal” and posing a threat to Nato countries, the outgoing head of the RAF said. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston told The Telegraph that Russia’s air force, surface navy and submarine force are a threat to Britain and Nato. He warned its threat could even get worse if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was ousted. A construction worker has been killed near the Russian village of Plekhovo, a few kilometres from the border with Ukraine after shelling from the Ukrainian side, said Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region. Works were being carried out not far from Plekhovo on fortifying defensive lines for the state border, the governor said on Telegram. Ukraine struck oil pipeline installations deep inside Russia on Saturday with a series of drone attacks including on a station serving the vast Druzhba oil pipeline that sends western Siberian crude to Europe, according to Russian media. Ukrainian drone attacks inside Russia have been growing in intensity in recent weeks, and the New York Times reported that US intelligence believes Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month. Ukraine has asked Germany to supply it with Taurus cruise missiles, an air-launched weapon with a range of 500 km (310 miles), a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Berlin said on Saturday. Germany received the request several days ago, the spokesperson said, confirming a report by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. She declined to provide further details or say how likely it was that Germany would supply the missiles to Ukraine. Russia has dismissed criticism from the US president, Joe Biden, over Moscow’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying Washington had for decades deployed just such nuclear weapons in Europe. Russia said on Thursday it was pushing ahead with the first deployment of such weapons outside its borders since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, and the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the weapons were already on the move. Russia is to start expelling German diplomats, teachers and employees of cultural institutions next month. The measure is expected to further exacerbate tensions between the two countries, which have already had very fraught ties since Russia invaded Ukraine early last year. Russia failed in a bid to prevent Ukraine taking a place on the World Health Organization’s Executive Board, on a day which also saw North Korea gain a berth. Ten countries joined the board for a three-year term but Russia tried to exclude Ukraine, which it invaded 15 months ago, from joining the 34-nation forum at the ongoing World Health Assembly in Geneva. Russia has accused Japan of “cynical, unscrupulous speculation” over Tokyo’s comments around the nuclear threat Moscow poses and promised to respond to Japan’s latest round of sanctions imposed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said on Friday that Japan would place additional sanctions on Russia after the G7 summit Tokyo hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The death toll from a Russian missile attack on an outpatient clinic in the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro has risen to two, with 30 people wounded, according to media reports. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “Russian terrorists once again confirm their status of fighters against everything humane and honest.” Tehran on Saturday accused Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, of anti-Iranian propaganda in his call for Iran to halt the supply of drones to Russia, saying his comments were designed to attract more arms and financial aid from the west. Zelenskiy in a video address on Wednesday called on Iranians to stop their slide into “the dark side of history” by supplying Moscow with drones. A Belarus court has rejected an appeal by a jailed Polish-Belarusian journalist against his eight-year prison sentence for reporting critically on president Alexander Lukashenko’s regime. Agence France-Presse reports that Andrzej Poczobut, a correspondent for the leading Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza and active member of the Polish minority in Belarus, was sentenced in February. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, plans to visit Finland, Sweden and Norway from this Monday to deepen cooperation on top national security and economic issues, the US state department has said. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Finland has joined Nato, with Sweden’s bid to join awaiting ratification from Hungary and Turkey. A deal allowing the safe export of grain and fertiliser from Ukrainian Black Sea ports has not yet resumed full operations, the UN said on Friday, having come to a halt before Russia’s decision last week to extend it. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has told China’s special envoy Li Hui there are “serious obstacles” to resuming peace talks, blaming Ukraine and western countries. Meanwhile, Russia’s deputy security council chair, Dmitry Medvedev, has said the conflict in Ukraine could last for decades and negotiations with Ukraine were impossible as long as Volodymyr Zelenskiy was in power. The former UK prime minister Boris Johnson and former US president Donald Trump discussed Ukraine and “the vital importance of Ukrainian victory” on Thursday, a spokesperson for Johnson said. Two years ago, Raman Pratasevich, a young Belarusian dissident blogger, was white-knuckled, begging a Ryanair flight crew not to make an emergency landing at Minsk airport, writes Andrew Roth and Shaun Walker. He said: “Don’t do this, they will kill me, I am a refugee,” according to a fellow passenger. The plane, escorted by a Belarusian Mig-29 fighter jet sent to force it down, landed anyway. Pratasevich was promptly arrested. Last week he emerged from custody. The activist and blogger, accused of more than 1,586 crimes, was charged on 10 counts including conspiracy to seize power. He was sentenced to eight years in prison and then promptly pardoned, his reward from Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko for becoming a full-throated mouthpiece of the regime. Ukraine’s ministry of defence has tweeted this video footage. Around 400 Ukrainian soldiers have started training on American M1 Abrams tanks in Germany, the New York Times reported. Half of the group started training in Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels in southern Germany, being taught medical skills and how to shoot firearms. The other half were taught how to fuel and maintain the tanks. Around 31 tanks were due to be sent to Germany to be used in the training programme, which is expected to last 10 to 12 weeks, according to the newspaper. A 73-year-old woman has died and two others have been injured after Russian troops shelled 16 areas in Zaporizhzhia, a local Ukrainian governor said. Yurii Malashko reported that Russia had launched 108 attacks against the southeastern city in one day using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, and drones. Malashko wrote on the Telegram messaging app: “The enemy will be held accountable for every war crime, for every broken fate and life that has been cut short. Ukrainians are strong and unbreakable, Victory is ours.” The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 6pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s headlines: Preliminary operations have begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of deoccupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines. Ukraine’s defence ministry has claimed Russia is planning to simulate a major accident at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to try to thwart Kyiv’s long-planned counteroffensive. The plant, in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, has been repeatedly hit by shelling that each side blames the other for. Russian forces have temporarily eased their attacks on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to regroup and strengthen their capabilities, a senior Kyiv official said on Saturday. Russia’s Wagner private army began handing over its positions to regular Russian troops this week after declaring full control of Bakhmut after the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, Reuters reported. In a statement on Telegram, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russian forces have continued attacking but that “overall offensive activity has decreased”. Russian forces have intercepted two long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles supplied to Ukraine by Britain, the RIA news agency cited the defence ministry as saying on Saturday. Reuters reports that the ministry said it had intercepted shorter-range US-built Himars-launched and Harm missiles, and shot down 13 drones in the last 24 hours, RIA reported.

That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Nadeem Badshah will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine. Russia failed in a bid to prevent Ukraine taking a place on the World Health Organization’s Executive Board, on a day which also saw North Korea gain a berth. Ten countries joined the board for a three-year term but Russia tried to exclude Ukraine, which it invaded 15 months ago, from joining the 34-nation forum at the ongoing World Health Assembly in Geneva. Normally those joining the forum, which plays a key role in the governance of the WHO, are elected on the nod but Moscow forced the first vote since 1977 at this year’s 76th assembly. In the event, the vote was easily carried by 123 votes to 13. Russia’s delegation stated: “We deeply regret the fact that the assembly has voted for a country that will simply further politicise the work of the EB,” saying it opposed “politicisation of the work of the WHA and of the WHO as a whole.” There was further acrimony at the gathering after the United States said it regretted the extension of a place for North Korea after it was put forward by South East Asia. Ukraine struck oil pipeline installations deep inside Russia on Saturday with a series of drone attacks including on a station serving the vast Druzhba oil pipeline that sends western Siberian crude to Europe, according to Russian media. Ukrainian drone attacks inside Russia have been growing in intensity in recent weeks, and the New York Times reported that US intelligence believes Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month. Ukraine has not publicly acknowledged launching attacks against targets inside Russia. The Ukrainian defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday, Reuters reported. In the Tver region, which lies just north-west of Moscow, two drones attacked a station that serves the Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline, one of the world’s largest oil pipelines, the Kommersant newspaper said. The Tver local council said that a drone had crashed near the village of Erokhino, about 500 km (310 miles) from the border with Ukraine. The Telegram channel Baza, which has good sources among Russia’s security services, said the drones attacked a station serving the Druzhba pipeline. Preliminary operations have already begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of de-occupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines. “The intensity is increasing, but it will take quite a long period of time,” he added, predicting that as the counteroffensive gathered momentum, there would be more incursions into Russia by Russian rebel groups, such as the raid in Belgorod region earlier this week. On Saturday the commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, raised expectations that a major operation could be imminent by declaring on social media: “The time has come to take back what’s ours.” Zaluzhnyi’s declaration on the Telegram messaging app was accompanied by a cinematic video showing heavily armed Ukrainian soldiers preparing for battle to a soundtrack of ominous music and a narrator reciting a prayer calling for strength to “annihilate” Ukraine’s enemies. Russian forces have intercepted two long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles supplied to Ukraine by Britain, the RIA news agency cited the defence ministry as saying on Saturday. Reuters reports that the ministry said it had intercepted shorter-range US-built Himars-launched and Harm missiles, and shot down 13 drones in the last 24 hours, RIA reported. More on the expulsion of German diplomats from Russia (see 12:53pm). Germany has said more than 100 employees will be withdrawn after Moscow imposed limits on the numbers allowed to work at diplomatic missions in Russia, a source with the German foreign ministry said on Saturday. “This limit, set by Russia for the beginning of June, requires a major cut in all areas of our presence in Russia,” the source said, Reuters reports. Those affected included teachers, as well as other employees of schools and the Goethe Institute, and was necessary to maintain the right balance for Germany’s diplomatic presence, said the person, who described the number affected as at least 100. Relations between Russia and Germany, which used to be the biggest buyer of Russian oil and gas, have broken down since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the west responded with sanctions and weapons supplies. The source called the limit, announced in April, “unilateral, unjustified and incomprehensible”. The person declined to say what the limit imposed by Moscow was. The number of German employees leaving was earlier reported by Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung. Russia’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Russia is to start expelling German diplomats, teachers and employees of cultural institutions next month. The measure is expected to further exacerbate tensions between the two countries, which have already had very fraught ties since Russia invaded Ukraine early last year. The German foreign ministry criticised Russia’s move, calling it an “unilateral, unjustified and incomprehensible decision”. The expulsions will affect several hundred German state employees, including teachers and staff of the Goethe Institute, which promotes German culture and language abroad, the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported. It comes in response to the reduction of the presence of Russian intelligence services in Germany earlier this year. A construction worker has been killed near the Russian village of Plekhovo, a few kilometres from the border with Ukraine after shelling from the Ukrainian side, said Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region. Works were being carried out not far from Plekhovo on fortifying defensive lines for the state border, the governor said on Telegram. Reuters could not immediately verify the report. Russia has accused Japan of “cynical, unscrupulous speculation” over Tokyo’s comments around the nuclear threat Moscow poses and promised to respond to Japan’s latest round of sanctions imposed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said on Friday that Japan would place additional sanctions on Russia after the G7 summit Tokyo hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Matsuno also condemned Russia’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying it would further inflame the situation and that Japan would never accept “Russia’s nuclear menace, let alone its use”. Russia’s foreign ministry said it was assessing the implementation of Japan’s sanctions on its national security and economy and would not leave Tokyo’s “illegitimate actions” unanswered, Reuters reported. The ministry also took issue with Matsuno’s casting of Russia as engaging in “nuclear blackmail”. Defeat in its war against Ukraine would leave Russia “vindictive” and “brutal” and posing a threat to Nato countries, the outgoing head of the RAF said. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston told The Telegraph that Russia’s air force, surface navy and submarine force are a threat to Britain and Nato. He warned its threat could even get worse if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was ousted. He said: When the Ukraine conflict is over and Ukraine has restored its borders, as it must, we will have a damaged, vindictive, and brutal Russia, whose means of harming us is through air attack, missile attack and subsurface attack. Sir Mike is set to step down next month after four years at the top of the RAF. He added: But it also demonstrates that this is more than about just one person. There is a whole structure and a hierarchy behind Putin. So even if Putin was to disappear off the stage, there are countless others that could replace him that could be as equally as brutal and vicious to their own people and to neighbouring states. Russian forces have temporarily eased their attacks on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to regroup and strengthen their capabilities, a senior Kyiv official said on Saturday. Russia’s Wagner private army began handing over its positions to regular Russian troops this week after declaring full control of Bakhmut after the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, Reuters reported. In a statement on Telegram, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russian forces have continued attacking but that “overall offensive activity has decreased”. “Yesterday and today there have not been any active battles – neither in the city nor on the flanks,” she wrote, adding that Moscow’s troops were instead shelling the outskirts and approaches to Bakhmut. “The decrease in the enemy’s offensive activity is due to the fact that troops are being replaced and regrouped,” Maliar said. “The enemy is trying to strengthen its own capabilities.” She added that Ukrainian troops “firmly hold” the heights overlooking Bakhmut from the north and south, as well as a portion of the outskirts, but have not advanced during the past two days to focus on “other tasks”. Ukraine has asked Germany to supply it with Taurus cruise missiles, an air-launched weapon with a range of 500 km (310 miles), a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Berlin said on Saturday. Germany received the request several days ago, the spokesperson said, confirming a report by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. She declined to provide further details or say how likely it was that Germany would supply the missiles to Ukraine. If it supplied the missiles, Germany would be following in the footsteps of Britain, which earlier in May became the first country to publicly provide Kyiv with long-range cruise missiles. The United States has so far declined to supply Ukraine with the 297-km range Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles amid concerns that Ukraine could use them to strike inside Russia’s internationally recognised borders. Ukraine has been asking for months for these kind of weapons, but support from western allies has focused on shorter-range weapons Russia has dismissed criticism from the US president, Joe Biden, over Moscow’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying Washington had for decades deployed just such nuclear weapons in Europe. Russia said on Thursday it was pushing ahead with the first deployment of such weapons outside its borders since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, and the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the weapons were already on the move. Biden said on Friday he had an “extremely negative” reaction to reports that Russia has moved ahead with a plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reported. The US state department denounced the Russian nuclear deployment plan. “It is the sovereign right of Russia and Belarus to ensure their security by means we deem necessary amid of a large-scale hybrid war unleashed by Washington against us,” Russia’s embassy in the United States said in a statement. “The measures we undertake are fully consistent with our international legal obligations.” The US has said the world faces the gravest nuclear danger since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis because of remarks by Vladimir Putin during the Ukraine conflict, but Moscow says its position has been misinterpreted. Tehran on Saturday accused Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy of anti-Iranian propaganda in his call for Iran to halt the supply of drones to Russia, saying his comments were designed to attract more arms and financial aid from the west. Zelenskiy in a video address on Wednesday called on Iranians to stop their slide into “the dark side of history” by supplying Moscow with drones. Iran initially denied supplying Shahed drones to Russia but later said it had provided a small number before the conflict began. Ukraine says the drones have played a major role in Russia’s attacks on cities and infrastructure. “The Ukrainian president’s repeat of delusional claims against the Islamic Republic of Iran is in line with the anti-Iranian propaganda and media war aimed at attracting as many arms and financial aid as possible from western countries,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said in a statement carried by Iranian media. Ukraine, Kanaani said, has been refusing to allow an independent investigation into these claims. A Belarus court has rejected an appeal by a jailed Polish-Belarusian journalist against his eight-year prison sentence for reporting critically on president Alexander Lukashenko’s regime. Agence France-Presse reports that Andrzej Poczobut, a correspondent for the leading Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza and active member of the Polish minority in Belarus, was sentenced in February. He had extensively reported on mass protests against Lukashenko and refused to leave the Moscow-allied country after authorities unleashed an historic crackdown on dissent. Belarus’s supreme court said in a statement that the sentence was “left unchanged”. The verdict has come into force. Poczobut, 50, who stood trial in his home city of Grodno, near the Polish border, was found guilty of taking part in “actions harming national security” and “inciting hatred”. Poland, Belarus’s western EU-member neighbour, has condemned the trial and called for his release. After Poczobut’s appeal was rejected, Warsaw said it would impose new punitive measures against Lukashenko’s regime next week. The Polish interior minister, Mariusz Kaminski, said on Twitter: On Monday, I will announce the decision to add to the sanctions list several hundred representatives of the Lukashenko regime responsible for political repression, including repression against Poles living in Belarus. Ukraine’s defence ministry has claimed Russia is planning to simulate a major accident at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to try to thwart Kyiv’s long-planned counter-offensive. The plant, in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, has been repeatedly hit by shelling that each side blames the other for. Reuters reports that the Ukrainian defence ministry’s intelligence directorate said Russian forces would soon shell the plant and then announce a radiation leak. This would force an investigation by international authorities, during which all hostilities would be stopped. The directorate’s statement, posted on Telegram, did not provide any proof. It said Russia had disrupted the planned rotation of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, who are based at the plant. The agency, which frequently posts updates on the plant, has made no mention of any disruption. Last week witnesses said Russian military forces had been enhancing defensive positions in and around the plant ahead of the counter-offensive. Ukraine is ready to launch its much-anticipated counteroffensive against Russian forces, a senior Ukrainian official has told the BBC. The broadcaster reported that Oleksiy Danilov would not name a date but said an assault to retake territory from President Vladimir Putin’s occupying forces could begin “tomorrow, the day after tomorrow or in a week”. He said Kyiv had “no right to make a mistake” on the decision because it was an “historic opportunity” that “we cannot lose”. As secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, Danilov is at the heart of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s de facto war cabinet. Danilov also told the BBC he was “absolutely calm” about Russia beginning to deploy nuclear weapons to Belarus, saying: “To us, it’s not some kind of news.” The Wagner mercenary group’s forces have probably begun to withdraw from some of their positions around the devastated Ukrainian city of Bakhmut and are likely to be used for other offensive operations in the Donbas region, according to British intelligence. The UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update that Wagner’s owner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, had said the withdrawal had begun and positions were being transferred to Russian defence ministry forces. Kyiv corroborated Wagner’s rotation out from the city’s outskirts. The UK ministry said in its update, posted on Twitter, that forces of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic had probably entered the eastern Ukrainian city since Wednesday to start “clearance operations”. Bakhmut has been the scene of the war’s longest and bloodiest battle. The ministry said: Ukrainian forces had taken 20 square kilometres of Bakhmut’s flanks as of 16 May. The rotation out of Wagner forces is likely to continue in controlled phases to prevent collapse in pockets around Bakhmut. Despite Prigozhin’s ongoing feud with the Russian MOD [ministry of defence], Wagner forces will likely be used for further offensive operations in the Donbas following reconstituting its forces. US president Joe Biden has said he had an “extremely negative” reaction to reports that Russia has moved ahead with its plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, while the European Union has condemned the plan. Reuters reports that the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said: This is a step which will lead to further extremely dangerous escalation. Russia signed a pact with Belarus on Thursday about the storage of the warheads, at a facility due to be finished in just over a month. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said later that the relocation of some of the weapons had already begun. Borrell said the agreement contravened multiple international agreements. We call on Russia to abide by these commitments. The Belarusian regime is an accomplice in Russia’s illegal and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. Borrell said any attempt “to further escalate the situation will be met by a strong and coordinated reaction”. Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. This is Adam Fulton and here’s an overview of the latest. The European Union has condemned Russia’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in neighbouring Belarus, while US president Joe Biden says he had an “extremely negative” reaction to reports that Russia has already begun moving ahead with the plan. More on that story soon. In other news: The death toll from a Russian missile attack on an outpatient clinic in the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro has risen to two, with 30 people wounded, according to media reports. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “Russian terrorists once again confirm their status of fighters against everything humane and honest.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, plans to visit Finland, Sweden and Norway from this Monday to deepen cooperation on top national security and economic issues, the US state department has said. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Finland has joined Nato, with Sweden’s bid to join awaiting ratification from Hungary and Turkey. A deal allowing the safe export of grain and fertiliser from Ukrainian Black Sea ports has not yet resumed full operations, the UN said on Friday, having come to a halt before Russia’s decision last week to extend it. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has told China’s special envoy Li Hui there are “serious obstacles” to resuming peace talks, blaming Ukraine and western countries. Meanwhile, Russia’s deputy security council chair, Dmitry Medvedev, has said the conflict in Ukraine could last for decades and negotiations with Ukraine were impossible as long as Volodymyr Zelenskiy was in power. The former UK prime minister Boris Johnson and former US president Donald Trump discussed Ukraine and “the vital importance of Ukrainian victory” on Thursday, a spokesperson for Johnson said. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said in a phone call with his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, that Russia is open to dialogue over Ukraine. Lula tweeted that he had reiterated Brazil’s willingness to talk to both sides of the war in Ukraine but declined Putin’s invitation to visit. Russia has blamed Kyiv for dozens of strikes on its southern Belgorod region. Its governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said the Ukrainian military was responsible for artillery, mortar and drone attacks across the region over 24 hours but reported no casualties. In a rare attack on the southern Russian city of Krasnodar, east of Crimea, two drones damaged buildings in the city centre, officials said. In the neighbouring Rostov region, the governor said a Ukrainian missile had been shot down near Morozovsk, where there is a Russian airbase. Canada will donate 43 AIM-9 missiles to Ukraine to help the country “secure its skies”, the national defence has said. “Canada’s support for Ukraine is unwavering,” said Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. The country also said it welcomed Ukraine’s application to join the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership (CPTPP). Moscow’s city court will hold a preliminary hearing next Wednesday in a new criminal case against the jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on charges including incitement to extremism. The Russian arms company Kalashnikov, maker of the world’s most widely used assault rifle, is launching a division for the production of kamikaze drones – a key weapon used in the Ukraine war. Ukraine said it shot down 10 missiles and 25 drones launched by Russia in overnight attacks on the capital of Kyiv, the city of Dnipro and eastern regions. Several drones and missiles hit targets in the Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, officials said on Friday. There was no immediate word of any deaths. The city of Donetsk has come under fire from Ukrainian forces, the Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said. As a result, he said, a young woman died and another was injured. Japan will place additional sanctions on Russia after the Group of Seven (G7) summit the country hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, the chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, has said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
