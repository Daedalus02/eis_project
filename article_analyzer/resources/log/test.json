The US fast food chain’s departure from Italy after seven years followed a period in which the business was badly hit by the coronavirus pandemic, which in turn forced traditional Italian pizzerias to adopt their own delivery services. The company set out with ambitious plans of opening 880 outlets across the country by 2030, hopeful that it could win over Italian customers with pizza topped with pineapple. It got as far as opening 29 branches, all of which have now been closed. Franchise holder ePizza filed for bankruptcy in April this year and all outlets stopped delivery services from 20 April, according to the Italian food website Agrodolce, which first reported the story earlier this month. Domino’s first foray into Italy was in Milan in 2015, before venturing to other cities including Turin, Bologna, Parma and the capital, Rome. It did not, however, make it to Naples, the southern city where pizza margherita was created. “It would have been very strange if [Domino’s] had worked here,” said Gino Sorbillo, who owns a pizzeria in in the city. “Naples is a very particular market – it wins on tradition, identity … it wouldn’t have worked if the only goal was to make money.” Domino’s Pizza was brought to Italy by the entrepreneur Alessandro Lazzaroni. The move followed a similarly brave culinary exploit years earlier when McDonald’s opened its first store in Bolzano in 1985. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am Lazzaroni said at the time that Italians were “very picky about food” but believed “the two great excellences” of Italian quality and American food delivery prowess could come together and be successful. The Domino’s venture had some initial success but ultimately could not compete, not even on price – given that a pizza in an Italian restaurant can cost as little as €5 (£4.22), on top of the widespread availability of shops serving pizza al taglio (pizza by the slice) for even less. That said, Lazzaroni, an ex-general manager of Burger King in Italy, now works for Crazy Pizza, a restaurant owned by the former Formula One team boss Flavio Briatore on Rome’s plush Via Veneto where a humble margherita costs €15.","Id":"world/2022/aug/10/dominos-retreats-from-italy-having-failed-to-conquer-the-home-of-the-pizza","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Domino’s retreats from Italy having failed to conquer the home of pizza","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/10/dominos-retreats-from-italy-having-failed-to-conquer-the-home-of-the-pizza","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/10/dominos-retreats-from-italy-having-failed-to-conquer-the-home-of-the-pizza","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":375,"webPublicationDate":"2022-08-10T17:01:49Z","id":"world/2022/aug/10/dominos-retreats-from-italy-having-failed-to-conquer-the-home-of-the-pizza","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"A solo trip around Europe, with my travel phobia? I only wish I’d done it sooner","body":"I’ve never been to Paris before, but it’s living up to its reputation so far. I only arrived a few minutes ago and have parked myself in a posh 1920s-style cafe across the road from Gare du Nord, where the Eurostar train deposits Channel-hoppers like me. I’m here to begin a three-week grand tour across the continent: from Paris to Naples via Nice, Florence and Rome. I’ve never travelled to mainland Europe before. I haven’t been able to afford it, and even if I’d had the money, anxiety would have kept me home as I suffer from mild travel phobia. So, as well as a holiday, this trip will also be a sort of aversion therapy. At the ingeniously named Café du Nord, a waiter in a black waistcoat, bow tie and beret brings my café au lait and croque monsieur on a small round tray, then departs with a nod and a “bon appetit”. It’s all very elegant. I eat, drink, tip, wave au revoir and leave for my hotel, a budget affair near the Bastille. I have to pinch myself: all this distance and beauty for less than £50 I only have three days in Paris, and intend to make the most of it. Some Parisians claim the best thing to do in the city is become a flâneur and wander aimlessly. But that whole concept could describe my life thus far, so I decide to see the sights. I grudgingly board an open-top bus tour. When I lived in London, I used to deride the gawping day trippers who’d view the city one monument at a time through tiny rectangles. But it’s a good way to see an unfamiliar city and get a potted history via the complimentary earphone commentary. La Promenade des Anglais in Nice. Photograph: Studio Barcelona/Alamy I also visit the Eiffel Tower: it’s just like Blackpool Tower only bigger, and in France. Then I go to see the Mona Lisa in the Louvre – it’s all right, but I don’t really see what all the fuss is about. Tomorrow I leave for Nice. The first part of the train journey to Nice is through scorched farmland, but after departing Marseille it takes in spectacular vistas of the French Riviera. To my left, misty mountains fill the horizon, lush vineyards lie trackside, and sandy-walled villas with sun-kissed copper roofs pepper verdant hillsides. On my right, there are clusters of exotic trees – palm, pine and olive. Beyond them is the Mediterranean, shimmering in the sun. I have to pinch myself: all this distance and beauty for less than £50. Nice is nice, but that’s as far as it goes. Again, the bus tour is worth doing, but the old town is the thing to see: a collection of pretty buildings where you can spend a fortune in a pretty cafe on a pretty alleyway and look at statues perched in the middle of marble fountains. I then head to the Promenade des Anglais where there are ice-creams, surfing and other coastal pastimes on its pebbled beach. The author in Place Massena, near the seafront in Nice. Photograph: Danny Lavelle If you’re fair-skinned like me, the big drawback about visiting the continent in August is that it’s baking hot. I end up looking like a soggy sundried tomato, which is more demoralising than usual given the number of olive-skinned beauties waltzing about in shorts and vests. I’m supposed to be heading to Italy, but I’ve left my phone in the taxi I took to the train station. These days losing your phone is like losing a limb, so I’m panicking and considering visiting the British consulate and calling this whole thing off. On the Find Me app on my laptop I watch my phone do circles of nearby Monte Carlo. I resolve to get another cab and instruct the driver to follow my phone icon. Unfortunately, the app is unreliable, so I return to the station and somehow contact Uber and the driver, who returns my phone hours later. That’s five hours of my life and £200 I’m never getting back, but finally I board the train to Genoa, and from there change to another heading south into the Tuscan hills. The Arno river in Florence. Photograph: Sergey Borisov/Alamy “Ahh, Florence,” I hear myself say more than once as I gaze at the opulent architecture, romantic streets and renaissance art. I feel genuinely emotional when I set eyes on the Piazza del Duomo and Florence’s 14th-century cathedral. The joy is sapped slightly by the roving groups of tourists. I’m a hypocrite, of course, because I’m one of them. Central Florence, at least when I visit, feels like an estate agent has curated it. It’s spotless, and boy are you being sold something. That something being a version of Italy seen through the lens of a Dolmio ad. The restaurants play the Godfather soundtrack on a loop and serve pizza, pasta, gelato and more pizza. At one restaurant, a slight man wanders up, sets an amp down and mimes to Pavarotti, wild gesticulations and all. The best way to see Rome is on an electric scooter in the early hours of the morning My next stop is Rome. It’s an ethereal place. It feels as if I’m being ambushed by history – ancient fountains, the Colosseum and the Spanish Steps – with manicured cypresses, broad umbrella pines and lush palm trees appearing around corners with no warning. The best way to see Rome is on an electric scooter in the early hours of the morning. I whiz around empty cobbled streets, and the city’s landmarks look even more dramatic lit up. The one thing I have to see in Rome is the Sistine Chapel. To gaze up at Michelangelo’s ceiling, I have to buy a ticket for the Vatican Museum, and like many museums and tourist attractions on this trip, that had to be arranged through an unnecessary middleman. This involves visiting a tobacconist a few metres from the museum, where a tour guide picks me up, walks me to the museum entrance, hands over the tickets, then leaves. (I later learn that I could have booked a slot online.) I walk through several galleries on the way to Michelangelo’s masterpiece, but they’re more than worth it. The gallery of maps is spectacular – with its gilded vaulted ceiling and gorgeous frescoes. Painted topographical maps inspired by Ignazio Danti’s drawings decorate the walls and giant windows offer stunning views of the city. The ‘awesome’ Sistine Chapel frescoes in the Vatican. Photograph: Daniel Lavelle I finally get to the main event. It’s serious here. No photos, no shorts or vests, and the Vatican demands silence, which of course, everyone ignores. The ceiling is an awesome feat, but I find the paintings disturbing. Many frescoes depict suffering and trauma; an entire wall shows demons dragging naked people to hell on one side, and angels carrying people to heaven on the other. Also, it’s impossible to experience the chapel as Michelangelo intended – recumbent and in silence – because the place is heaving, and security can’t wait to get you out again. I had planned to end my trip with a few days in Naples – for the pizza and ice-cream. But as that’s all I have eaten since arriving in Italy, I decide not to go on south. If you’re interested, the best pizza I had was at Mister Pizza, next to the cathedral in Florence. And the best ice-cream was in Via del Boschetto, a trendy street near the Colosseum in Rome. This was a stressful journey for me but I’m glad I did it. In fact, I wish I’d had the courage to do this years ago. Way to go Getting there Crossing the Channel on Eurostar costs from £69 one-way, Paris to Nice costs from €55, Nice to Genoa from €19, Genoa to Florence from €19 and Florence to Rome from €15. Related: A private view: explore the quieter side of Florence Stay In Florence, Casa Regina Santo Rosario (single rooms from €50 B&B) is a convent guesthouse where rooms are small and facilities shared, but it has a gorgeous garden, is very clean and quiet, and the nuns are friendly. In Rome II Covo B&B (doubles from €90 B&B) is near the Colosseum and has high ceilings, opulent decor and a roof garden. Eat In Paris I enjoyed the best Greek food I’ve ever had at La Maison de Gyros near the river in the Latin Quarter. The souvlaki (€6 with chips) was delicious and the interior is all higgledy-piggledy chairs and tables, barmy artwork, books and other ornaments. In Florence I loved the pizzas (from €8.50) at Mister Pizza and ravioli (€12) and lager at Le Botteghe di Donatello, both near the cathedral. If you thought you’d eaten every pizza topping going, check out the daily changing menu of takeaway slices at Bonci Pizzarium near the Vatican in Rome. There could be cod and potato pizza, or pumpkin puree and octopus, all from €4 a slice.","Id":"travel/2023/jan/28/a-solo-trip-around-europe-with-my-travel-phobia-i-only-wish-id-done-it-sooner","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webTitle":"A solo trip around Europe, with my travel phobia?

It’s where her publisher takes her to celebrate when she has delivered a book manuscript. She’s nearing such a deadline when we meet there – just finalising the endnotes to her new title about Roman emperors, a companion volume to SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome, her bestselling account of the empire’s rise and fall – so she carries a bit of that demob spirit with her. She orders a glass of her favourite Basque spritz wine, txiki blanco, and a plate of Iberian pork, and settles back on a cushioned window seat into the lunchtime clatter of conversation. At 68, Beard has lately taken compulsory retirement from 40 years of teaching classics to undergraduates at her Cambridge college; now she is concentrating full time on illuminating the ancient world for the rest of us. In the days before we meet, I’ve been catching up on her required-reading blog, A Don’s Life. In it she uses the example of Marcus Licinius Crassus, one of the despised super-rich of the first century BC, to examine Nadhim Zahawi’s shocking tax affairs; she has compared the response to a devastating earthquake on the Turkish/Syrian borders 2,000 years ago – the emperor Trajan ploughed central funds into improved rebuilding schemes – with the planning failures of the recent disaster; and she has examined the Scottish prisons controversy in light of Roman attitudes to incarceration. In a world defined by what she calls “presentism”, a blinkered obsession with the here and now, Beard offers a spirited, repeated reminder that there is nothing new under the sun. That is the message of a series of short films she has just made for schools, which open up for teenagers “culture war” questions of free speech. Beard has lived on the frontline of that conflict for some time – cheerfully strapped to the mast as she navigates those rough seas between outrage and woke. “I don’t think university campuses are quite the nightmare of terror some newspapers want to make them,” she says. “But I think, too, it is probably easier for teachers to talk to kids about Socrates than about [social media]. He may have died 2,500 years ago, but it turns out he had quite a few of these ideas worked out. If you can encourage kids to think about the issues historically you have made a start. The ancient world can be a classic safe space.” Beard, who is fond of Cicero’s maxim “if we are not ashamed to think it, we should not be ashamed to say it”, has been a robust defender of context and common sense in our society of easy offence. She has, from time to time, jumped in to defuse manufactured apoplexy on Twitter, only to find herself a target for mansplaining and vicious misogyny. The worst case, she suggests, was when, responding to a tweet from far-right firestarter Paul Joseph Watson, she defended a BBC cartoon for depicting a Roman governor of ancient Britain as dark skinned. She pointed to the fact of the Algerian-born governor, Quintus Lollius Urbicus, only to be faced with an unlikely pile-on of Romans-were-all-white antagonists; the Black Swan economist Nassim Nicholas Taleb then attacked her “historian hearsay bullshit”. These days, she never takes a step back, but tries to choose her battles. “Everyone is policing everything,” she says, “and the left are just as bad as the right.” She is a little nostalgic for an era of more open and combative table talk. Ordering another glass of txiki, she recalls the bluntness of some of her mentors, who did not spare her feelings in delivering criticism, often over long lunches. “The most useful advice I ever received,” she says, “came from a man who was a real toughie. He would say things that you would never get away with now. I had written one of my first academic papers and given it him to read. We met, I remember, to discuss it in that original Pizza Express in Coptic Street near the British Museum. We were probably on our second bottle of wine and he said something about my paper which I’ve never forgotten: ‘It may be right, Mary, but it’s bloody boring.’ I was 24 or 25. I thought about it. Up until that moment I had always believed writing was just about saying what you wanted to say. But after that I realised there was someone else involved: you had to think about the reader.” Beard has never forgotten that advice. It explains her journalistic gift for making the past truthful and vivid news. Part of her motivation as a young feminist at Cambridge in the 1970s – her walls were papered with posters of the black activist Angela Davis – was to prove that classicists needn’t wear tweeds, and that archaeologists weren’t all “bronzed blokes in khaki shorts”. She knew she would have to work twice as hard and be twice as good as her male peers to make her name, but the challenge never fazed her. Some of that determination, she says, came from the example of her mother. “My mum,” she says, “was absolutely rock-solid Labour. She hadn’t been able to go to university because her parents couldn’t afford it. When she was a village schoolmistress she stood in the local council elections against the lord of the manor who had held the post for ever. She did it as an independent because if you wanted to win in the 1950s in rural Shropshire you didn’t mention the Labour party. She won a great victory against noblesse oblige. My dad was an old-fashioned liberal. They both hated the Tories for different reasons.” Her mother lived to be 80, old enough to see her daughter become a published writer, but not a TV star. Did she herself have trepidation about making that latter leap, taking classics fully mainstream? “I did when I started,” she says. “I was terribly suspicious about doing telly.” Again there was a food-related eureka moment. “One time we had about two minutes to explain the division of the Roman empire into four different parts. We were in Italy. The producer suggested we went to a pizzeria, and I cut a pizza into four and explained the history of each slice. I said, ‘You must be fucking joking. That is a bridge too far. This is complicated stuff.’ So she said, ‘OK, you do it your way. Just explain it. You have two minutes.’ I tried about three times and each time it got more boring. I could sense everyone switching off. On the fourth take I called for the pizza.” Mary ate Broad beans with couscous, yoghurt, toasted cumin and argan oil (£12). Wood-roasted pork belly with braised turnips, sherry vinegar, black beans and paprika (£31) Tim ate Romero peppers stuffed with salt cod brandada (£12). Fish stew with cod, prawns and mussels, almond, saffron and Nora pepper sauce (£32). Mary & Tim drank Akkaregi Txacoli Txiki, £9 a glass. Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer Beard pushes aside her emptied plate – “extremely good, and extremely calorific” – and we talk about what she’s up to after her book is done. “Right now, I want to rest,” she says. But I’m going to do a series of lectures in Chicago in a couple of months, which will become a book about why study classics.” And what’s the answer? She laughs, reaches for her wine. “I want to say that the kind of struggle you currently have – in most humanities disciplines, actually – between ‘classics is a bastion of white supremacy used to justify European dictatorship’ versus ‘classics is a liberalising force, showing the basis of democracy, gay rights etc’ kind of misses the point.” It is not, she suggests, about trying to view the past through the political lenses of the present. “I think the reason to study classics is that it teaches puzzlement and wonder. Is it legitimate to say, ‘We don’t need to make a moral judgment?’ If you are in Pompeii and you touch the cradle of a baby who has died at that moment all those years ago, you’d have to have a heart of stone not to be moved. But how do you begin to explain who these people were? I think it is that just-out-of-reachness that really teaches you of the difficulties of making sense of somebody else.” Related: Mary Beard: ‘Virgil was a radical rap artist of the first century BC’ We are pretty much the last table left in Moro, now, but she is warming to her theme. “We think of ourselves as at one end of progress and there are all sorts of reasons why that’s true – I don’t fancy going back to Rome, thank you very much – but we forget the people in Rome who critiqued what was happening at the time. The knowledge that all the battles we have today have been fought thousands of years before us. Well, to me it’s a bit humbling … and who doesn’t need to learn that?” Emperor of Rome by Mary Beard will be published in September by Profile","Id":"books/2023/mar/19/mary-beard-interview-everyone-is-policing-everything-culture-wars","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Mary Beard: ‘Everyone is policing everything.

The attack happened on the beach in Sturla, a district of the northern Italian city, where Rossana Padoan Falcone, 57, had gone to relax after work on Friday evening. “I was on the beach, sitting on my towel,” she told La Repubblica. “I was enjoying the breeze when a wild boar appeared next to me: I remained still – this is what they advise doing – but then he came up to me again and bit my arm.” Padoan Falcone, who is an activist for the Democratic party, said she had just eaten a pizza when the “quite big” boar appeared. “I thought he was attracted by the pizza, and that he would try to open the cardboard box that contained some leftovers,” she added. “Instead, he bit me.” She said she screamed, and that one fellow beachgoer came to help as her arm bled, while others fled in panic. She was taken to hospital, where, on top of a tetanus jab, she was given antibiotics and medication to treat potential rabies. Although it is not the first time wild boar have ventured to the beach in Genoa – in June, a pack of three tried to steal nibbles laid out on a table alongside sundowners – it is believed to be the first time anyone has been bitten. A woman in Rome last year had her shopping stolen by a herd of wild boar who surrounded her in a supermarket car park, rekindling a debate about the growing numbers of the animals and their presence in towns and cities. Padoan Falcone said the beach attack was a sign of Genoa’s “deterioration”. “It is unacceptable to put citizens at such risk,” she said. “I was on a beach where, next to me, there had been a couple with a child in a pram. What if the boar had bitten the child? That beach is also accessible by disabled people – why put them at risk? It needs to be manned.”","Id":"world/2022/jul/12/i-thought-he-was-attracted-by-the-pizza-wild-boar-bites-beachgoer-in-genoa","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"‘I thought he was attracted by the pizza’: wild boar bites beachgoer in Genoa ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/12/i-thought-he-was-attracted-by-the-pizza-wild-boar-bites-beachgoer-in-genoa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/12/i-thought-he-was-attracted-by-the-pizza-wild-boar-bites-beachgoer-in-genoa","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":365,"webPublicationDate":"2022-07-12T12:02:11Z","id":"world/2022/jul/12/i-thought-he-was-attracted-by-the-pizza-wild-boar-bites-beachgoer-in-genoa","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Parisian rum babas to Polish pierogi: six great breaks for foodies","body":"Kraków, Poland To accompany its castle, cobbles and glorious architecture, Poland’s culture capital also has a sterling food scene. Try the famed pierogi dumplings – the city has a festival devoted to them in all their varieties from 6-12 August – game, or bigos, a hearty pork-based hunter’s stew. There are also plenty of sweet treat options such as sernik (baked cheesecake) or Polish apple pie. The famous Wierzynek restaurant in Rynek Glowny central square, where a 650-year tradition of feasting meets pan-European cuisine, offers silver service and an impressive wine cellar. For something less refined, flame-grilled kielbasa sausages are common, and there’s excellent vegan food and ice-cream; for the latter, aim for locals’ favourite Lody na Starowiślnej, which makes fresh batches daily. Drinks-wise, you might try some of Poland’s flavoured vodkas – perhaps in rose water or apricot; or head to the Bunkier Sztuki Gallery of Contemporary Art for glasses of tank beer – a less-carbonated-than-normal lager – on a sunny cafe terrace. Where to stay: Hotel Saski Kraków, Curio Collection by Hilton The sophisticated Hotel Saski Krakow, Curio Collection by Hilton has a 200-year history in the heart of the old town. Legendary composers from Liszt to Brahms used to walk the halls and perform in its ballroom, Saska Hall. It’s also home to a superb restaurant that gives a modern makeover to vintage Polish dishes such as steak tartare, cottage-cheese dumplings or żurek, a sour rye soup. The concierge can also provide further insider dining tips. Munich, Germany You might well have heard of weissbier, but how about weisswurst? Concocted from pork back bacon and veal, and usually flavoured with lemon, mace and ginger, this ghostly sausage is a quintessential Munich snack – although, or so local lore dictates, one that should only be consumed before midday. Grillers are ubiquitous across the city, including at the food-focused Viktualienmarkt beside stalls selling freshly baked pretzels. Pleasure seekers are also directed to the cosy Cafe Frischhut, which deep-fries the city’s doughnut-like schmalznudel pastries to order, and the Dallmayr delicatessen: effectively, a Bavarian version of the Fortnums food hall. Where to stay: Hilton Munich Airport Beer is another institution, even for those swerving Oktoberfest. Accordingly, a canny place to stay is this hotel – partly for its head-soothing heated pool, spa and Alps-inspired bedrooms, and partly due to an unexpected brewery. Though overshadowed by central Munich’s rowdy, 3,500-person Hofbräuhaus, the airport courtyard’s very own Airbräu brewery is brilliant, especially if you combine pints with their yummy, mac-and-cheese-esque spätzle. Bed will only be a few minutes’ walk away. Barcelona, Spain Around the beachside quarter of Barceloneta, taverns proffer a seafood-stacked paella made with noodles. Imported from Valencia, fideuà is just one of Barcelona’s culinary stalwarts; many of the others come in tapas form. Patatas bravas and pan con tomate are virtual perrenials on bar menus, as are croquetas, typically filled with jamón or bacalao (salted cod), and deep-fried bombas balls. Then you have open montadito sandwiches, paprika-powered pulpo a la gallega – octopus and sliced potatoes, best enjoyed alongside cava at the old La Boqueria food market – and, utterly Catalan, cargols a la llauna: oven-cooked, in-shell snails, often dished up with aioli. Where to stay: Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona You can also try new dishes with authentic Spanish flavours and local ingredients. Diners at Aürt, a luxurious Michelin one-star restaurant with a unique dining experience in the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, can sample thrilling 15-course locavore tasting menus by head chef Artur Martínez; or, over in Ma’i, his own experimental tapas and cocktails. Very close to sandy Nova Mar Bella beach, the hotel throws in its own beach club in Puro Beach, a seasonal outdoor pool and sea-view rooms for good measure. Naples, Italy Margherita pizza was invented in Naples to honour an eponymous queen’s visit in 1889 – as attested by a plaque at proud Pizzeria Brandi. Today, strict rules govern the production of “proper” wood-fired Neapolitan margheritas, with stronger San Marzano tomatoes, rich buffalo mozzarella and fresh basil leaves all non-negotiable. Neighbourhood pizzerias are as common as Vespas around the frenzied southern city and its laundry-lined lanes. That said, simple spaghetti alle vongole (clams) constitutes another lure for gourmands, as do shell-shaped sfogliatelle puff pastries and powerful coffees produced in gravity-reliant cuccumella flip pots. In Naples, drink in the sea views from the rooftop Niq Bar Photograph: Roberto Pastrovicchio/No credit Where to stay: The Britannique Naples, Curio Collection by Hilton Returning to pizza – because, in Naples, there’s really no avoiding it – if you try just one Neapolitan margherita, do so at century-old Gorizia, up in posh Vomero. From this fabled hilltop haunt, you can then descend via funicular to the Britannique Naples and indulge in the solarium or spa before a siesta. Fancy a nightcap? Ask for a fine limoncello, made using world-renowned Amalfi lemons, while enjoying sensational sea views from the rooftop Niq Bar. Paris, France From Norman moules frites to southern cassoulets, Paris unites Gallic favourites – with the archetypal place to try them a bistro decked out with the classic brass rails and red velvet chairs. Asian cuisine is also exceptionally good here, as are classic French favourites; as 2022’s reigning best butter croissant-maker in the sacrosanct Concours du Meilleur Croissant du Grand Paris competition, the Carton boulangerie should be your first stop. Two other must-tries are multicoloured macarons (plus, for peak decadence, a chocolat chaud) from Carette’s iconic Place des Vosges branch and the cult chocolate-pistachio “escargot” pastries made by baking god Christophe Vasseur in Du Pain et des Idées, near cool canal Saint-Martin.

A more comfortable place to try this alcohol-soaked dessert, however, lies on the other side of Galeries Lafayette amid this stylishly grand Hilton Paris Opera. Built for the Universal Exposition at the same time as the Eiffel Tower – 1889 – it’s all grand 19th-century architecture and handily placed for the Louvre and plenty of other major attractions. Its romantic Le Grand Salon is open all day below two colossal chandeliers, and serves sweet tooths a further pair of classic Parisian delicacies: mille-feuilles and profiteroles. You only live once, after all … Rome, Italy At its heart, cucina Romana revolves around four simple pasta sauces, each of them typically clinging to spaghetti or bucatini. Both the tomatoey amatriciana and peppery gricia feature guanciale (cured pork jowl), while cacio e pepe, a culinary phenomenon in recent years, is built from only three ingredients: pasta, black pepper and pecorino cheese. Best known of all is carbonara: egg yolks, rendered guanciale and pecorino romano – but, please, never cream. While this quartet can be found everywhere, they’re best scoffed in traditional trattorias amid riverside Trastevere.

A wine that was once one of the staples of the UK’s vast Italian restaurant scene, has rather fallen from favour in recent years, languishing in that difficult place where passé has yet to become vintage. I suspect many of us haven’t missed it because, even at the height of their popularity, the vast majority of wines produced in the Frascati vineyards in Lazio just south of Rome were never exactly memorable. There was a tendency, in the area’s fertile volcanic soils, to push production as high as possible, rather than curtailing yields in the hope of making wines of character and verve. In what is a familiar story across Italy, however, producers tired of having the name of their region associated with thin, acidic, quasi-industrial wines have persisted with a different approach, among them the Santarelli family, makers of the electrifying swirl of minerals and stone fruit of Castel del Paolis Frascati Superiore. Waitrose Soave Classico, Italy 2021 (£7.99, Waitrose) At its best, Frascati is never super-showy or massively aromatic. The pleasure derived from a wine like Castel del Paolis or the equally attractive Principe Pallavicini Frascati 2020 (£13.99, noblegrape.co.uk) is all in the mouthwatering purity and subtle insinuations of lemon skin, blossom or hillside herb, a set of characteristics that means they are also adept at performing what their producers would see as their primary role as mouthwatering companions to food (especially fish). You could say something similar of another traditional Italian dry white wine staple of trattoria and pizza places: Soave. Like Frascati, the northeastern Italian wine’s name hasn’t always been a byword for arresting personality and quality. But well-made, and great value wines such as Tesco Finest Soave Classico Superiore (£7.50) or Waitrose Soave Classico both offer wines of gently insinuating acidity and soft pear and apple juiciness which are brilliantly unobtrusive partners for scallops or seafood risotto. Campogrande Orvieto Classico, Italy 2021 (£9, The Co-op) The very best Soave, such as the single-vineyard bottlings from Pieropan, Gini and Inama, among others, take things to a whole other level of interest and flavoury intensity: wines such as Inanama Vigneti Foscarino Soave Classico 2019 (£21.99, Waitrose), take on ever-increasing depths of macerated herb and honey and more tropically fruited tones as they age, while retaining that essential food-matching raciness. There is plenty of character, too, in the wines made by the best producers in the third of this week’s triumvirate of neglected Italian white wine regions, Orvieto, in Umbria. As with Soave and Frascati, much of what is produced in what is by far the biggest and best-known Umbrian wine region is still near-neutral, vaguely peachy dry whites for drinking without thinking in your local pizza place. But wines such as Campogrande, the work of Tuscan winemaking grandees the Antinori family, or Barberani Orvieto Classico 2021 (from £10.99, thewinesociety.com; vinissiumus.co.uk) have a bright citrussy, subtly nutty allure.

Nor are they limited to offering a savoury snack or sweet treat. Instead they have quietly transformed into hi-tech cashless devices selling everything you could possibly need on the move, from false eyelashes to milk, and now books. The publisher Penguin Random House is showcasing a book vending machine at Exeter St Davids railway station in Devon. The titles available include Taste by Stanley Tucci, but what is sold will change regularly, partly based on key moments in the year such as Black History Month. David Llewellyn, chief executive of the Automatic Vending Association, said there has been a rise in machines offering personal protective equipment for workers, as well as a growth in “micro-markets”. “These are small retail units that sit within an office block offering fresh food, snacks and confectionery,” he says. “It’s like a small unattended retail corner, using things like smart fridges that can read what is taken out of them. You can buy a whole meal.” Llewellyn thinks micro-markets have arisen because of different working patterns, with more people at home. “There are less people consistently on sites now, so not huge demand for canteens,” he says. Book vending machines are not entirely new. The first Penguin book vending machine sprang up in Charing Cross Road in 1937, and at the time the books cost sixpence each. In 2019, short-story vending machines arrived in Canary Wharf in London. They dispensed one-, three- and five-minute stories free to passersby. Llewellyn says the vending market had a £2.2bn turnover before the pandemic, which dropped by around 40% when lockdowns forced people out of the offices, transport hubs and leisure spaces where they are most commonly found. However, sales are expected to return to pre-Covid levels this year. The Mr Go Pizza vending machine, installed in Rome in 2021, is said to knead, season and cook the pizza in three minutes. Photograph: Antonio Masiello/Getty Pizza is another product that has emerged as a top seller, with machines serving the dish popping up from Hampshire to Bristol. Even Italy got in on the act with its own device close to Piazza Bologna in Rome: Mr Go Pizza offers four varieties, including the classic margherita, each costing between €4.50 (£4) and €6 (£5.30). Maud Gerbault, business developer manager at API Tech, which produces pizza vending machines, said: “We have more than 2,800 machines installed in Europe and around 10 will be installed shortly in US … Sales are increasing exponentially. They double every year. “We deeply think that it is the future, especially after the lockdown from the Covid period. Our customers were able to keep the business running during this difficult period of time.” Gerbault adds: “It also provides a local outlet with quality food in rural and underserved areas. It combines short circuits and technology. It attracts a larger customer base due to a new type of business.” Related: The vending machines of Tokyo – in pictures Japan is home to the most unusual vending operations, offering everything from umbrellas to fancy dress. A new model sells fresh bear meat. The machine, in the northern prefecture of Akita, was installed at the end of last year, according to media reports. The last formal count, conducted by a trade body in December 2020, found that there were 2.7m vending machines in Japan – one for every 46 citizens. Llewellyn says the UK is following Japan down the route of offering more fresh food in vending, although it is unlikely we will ever reach that country’s sheer number of machines. “There is a huge array of machines [in Japan], but they have a lot of public vending which would not stand our climate or our social responsibility to other people’s equipment. People don’t beat machines up in Japan.”","Id":"business/2023/apr/09/big-vendors-hi-tech-devices-sell-eyelashes-pizza-and-now-books","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webTitle":"Quick lit: vending machines dispense false eyelashes, milk – and now books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/09/big-vendors-hi-tech-devices-sell-eyelashes-pizza-and-now-books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/apr/09/big-vendors-hi-tech-devices-sell-eyelashes-pizza-and-now-books","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":605,"webPublicationDate":"2023-04-09T16:00:04Z","id":"business/2023/apr/09/big-vendors-hi-tech-devices-sell-eyelashes-pizza-and-now-books","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for Sicilian-inspired bread with greens and cheese","body":"A few summers ago, on the way back from a morning on the beach in southern Sicily, we stopped to get pizza for lunch. I remember this for several reasons. Because as I got out of the car, the Y strap pulled out of the base of my blue flip-flop – a little thing with an enormous effect. Because, while I was waiting in front of the pizza cabinet still thinking about my foot, a tray of just-baked things the shape of Cornish pasties was brought out and put on a crate near the door to cool. But mostly I remember because, as we drove home and I pulled one in half so we could share it, a bit of green and cheese dropped in my lap. And, despite talcum and stain remover, it left a faint but unmissable mark on a useful dress. A grease souvenir from Sicily. You find small members of the extensive stuffed bread family all over southern Italy: hot bread around a soft and tasty filling. As well as the cheese and greens on that day, there was sausage and broccoli, and another slightly bigger version filled with tomato and olives. During the same trip, we would return to the same place, Le Signorine Spasciamaronna (so-called because their brother, who owns the shop next door, also unwraps the Madonna for the annual procession and is known as spasciamaronna). Often, we would buy the individual ones, other times a large filled bread pie to share, or slices of deep Sicilian pizza with anchovy, tomato and breadcrumbs. Then, along with a car full of sand, we brought the recipe home and made it our own. The bread part of the recipe is similar to focaccia and is similarly accommodating. I suggest plain and strong flour, but feel free to replace some of either with semolina flour, if you like. While I am superstitiously attached to activating both dried and fresh yeast by mixing it with a bit of the water, flour and little sugar first, I am told this is entirely unnecessary, so have left it out of this recipe. The key is to evaporate (or pour away) all the liquid extruded by the greens as they wilt. The most important recipe instruction, however, is to make the filling as tasty as possible: taste, taste again and season enthusiastically, adding more chilli, cheese, capers or bits of sausage, if you like. Serve and eat while the filled bread moons are still warm, with a cold beer and a bag of crisps. Ready for crimping. Photograph: Rachel Roddy/The Guardian Sicilian-inspired filled bread with greens and cheese Prep 25 min Rest/Rise 2 hr Cook 20 min Makes 10 200g plain flour 200g strong bread flour 1 tsp (7 g) fast-action dry yeast (or 15g fresh) 10g fine salt Extra-virgin olive oil 12 spring onions, trimmed and roughly chopped 800g mixed greens – spinach, chard, escarole, borage 1 tsp red chilli flakes, or to taste 100g pitted olives 200g ricotta 50g parmesan, grated 1 egg, beaten, for brushing Put the flours, yeast and salt in a bowl and swirl together. Add two tablespoons of olive oil and 300ml warm water. Plunge one hand in and use it like the dough hook of a stand mixer until all the flour has been incorporated. Pat the mix into a shaggy mass, cover and leave to rest for 15 minutes. Don’t worry if the dough feels sticky – it will be fine. Rub olive oil on a work surface and plop the dough on top. Flatten it out gently, then fold the dough from the edges towards the centre. Do this few times, then cover with the upturned bowl and leave to rest for 15 minutes. Repeat the folding, then return the dough to the bowl and put in a warm spot for an hour, until it has doubled in size. In a big pan, fry the spring onions in olive oil until soft, then add the greens, bit by bit if necessary, and tame them until they wilt. Press down with a spoon to release any water and leave that to evaporate away. Tip into a bowl, chop with scissors, then add a little more oil, the red chilli, olives and cheese. Cut the dough into 80g pieces and, on a floured surface, roll into 20cm circles. Put 60-70g of greens in the centre of each one, then fold into half-moons, pinching them closed. Lift on to a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper, leave to rest for another 30 minutes, then brush with egg and bake for 20 minutes. • This recipe was amended on 3 June 2022. An earlier version omitted to include red chilli flakes in the ingredients list. In addition, the instructions said to pat the dough “into saucer-sized circles” and then add “a plum-sized amount of greens in the centre of each one”. This has been clarified to say “roll out to 20cm diameter circles” and “60-70g of greens”.","Id":"food/2022/may/30/rachel-roddy-recipe-sicilian-filled-bread-greens-cheese","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webTitle":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for Sicilian-inspired bread with greens and cheese | A kitchen in Rome","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/may/30/rachel-roddy-recipe-sicilian-filled-bread-greens-cheese","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/may/30/rachel-roddy-recipe-sicilian-filled-bread-greens-cheese","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":828,"webPublicationDate":"2022-05-30T10:00:25Z","id":"food/2022/may/30/rachel-roddy-recipe-sicilian-filled-bread-greens-cheese","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Hiding in plain sight: how Sicily’s mafia godfather eluded capture for 30 years","body":"At 8.20am last Monday, Andrea Bonafede was queueing at the check-in of a private medical clinic in Palermo, Sicily. Suffering from colon cancer and thought to be 59, he had already undergone two operations and chemotherapy at the clinic, often bringing the staff presents of olive oil and exchanging phone numbers, and text messages, with his fellow patients. He was known to dress in flashy clothes: that morning he was wearing a sheepskin coat, a white hat, Ray-Ban shades and an expensive Franck Muller watch. Waiting for his Covid test, he went outside and walked towards the Fiat Brava, and the driver, that had brought him there. The undercover officers watching him worried that he had realised he was under surveillance and that he might be about to bolt. A colonel from the Carabinieri, Italy’s militarised police, decided to move in: “Are you Matteo Messina Denaro?” “You know who I am,” came the weary reply. A police composite photo of mafia top boss Matteo Messina Denaro, left; and, right, as he looks today. Photograph: AP The 150 police and Carabinieri who had been in position inside and outside the clinic suddenly sprang into action. Totò Schillaci, the former international footballer from Palermo, was caught up in the blitz, later comparing it to “a madhouse, a wild west”. Armed forces in balaclavas burst out of unmarked vehicles and blocked exit routes and streets. After 30 years on the run, Italy’s most wanted man – nicknamed U Siccu, or “Skinny” – had finally been captured. Realising what was happening, members of the public began to applaud. Some high-fived the men in balaclavas. In less than an hour, the arrest of Messina Denaro was front-page news across the globe. The Italian president, Sergio Mattarella (whose brother, Piersanti, was murdered by the mafia in 1980 when he was governor of Sicily) thanked the police and prosecutors. The prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, immediately flew to Palermo to congratulate the special forces on capturing the man who had helped plan a terrorist-style bombing campaign across Italy in 1992 and 1993. In those years, as the certainties of the First Republic disintegrated, the standoff between the Italian state and Cosa Nostra had turned into violent confrontation. Two dogged investigators, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, had persuaded a former mobster, Tommaso Buscetta, to turn state’s witness. The mafia’s secretive organisation and political connections were, for the first time, clearly revealed. In mass trials, 338 mafiosi were convicted. When those sentences were upheld on appeal, the mafia took its brutal revenge: their political protector, Salvo Lima, was executed in March 1992 and later that year both investigators were killed in very public bombings on the island. Falcone, his wife and three bodyguards were murdered on the road between the airport and Palermo in May; Borsellino was murdered in Palermo in July, along with five bodyguards, as he visited his sister and mother. Messina Denaro was involved in the operational planning of both bombings. The following year the terror campaign turned to the mainland. At 1.04am on 27 May 1993, a bomb exploded outside the Uffizi gallery, in Via dei Georgofili in Florence, destroying various works of art and killing five people, including a nine-year-old girl, Nadia, and her two-month-old sister. Two months later, on 27 July, a bomb outside a contemporary art gallery in Milan killed five; the next day, there were two further bombs in Rome, this time without victims. Messina Denaro was convicted, in absentia, of having also ordered and planned the mainland bombing campaign.

Photograph: Sipa/REX/Shutterstock Born in 1962 in the province of Trapani, Matteo Messina Denaro is the son of a convicted mobster who had worked for the wealthy D’Alì family. He became the protege of Totò Riina, the boss of bosses, and was renowned for being both a party-loving womaniser and a ruthless killer. He fell in love with an Austrian woman working in a hotel in Selinunte and when her manager, Nicola Consales, was overheard complaining about the “little mafiosi” who were lounging around the hotel, he was – in Palermo in 1991 – shot dead. A year later, another mobster complained about Riina’s strategy of a frontal assault on the Italian state. Messina Denaro invited Vincenzo Milazzo to a meeting, shot him, and strangled his pregnant partner, Antonella Bonomo. Later that year, he was part of the group that attempted to murder a policeman, Calogero Germanà. When one mafioso turned state’s witness, Messina Denaro was part of the cupola – the group of top mafia bosses – that ordered the kidnap of his 12-year-old son, Giuseppe di Matteo. The boy was held captive for 779 days before being strangled and dissolved in acid. Messina Denaro once boasted that he had killed enough people to fill a cemetery. But during his three decades in hiding, Messina Denaro also took the mafia in a new direction. Drive-by executions and semtex bombings guaranteed only crackdowns and bad headlines, and U Siccu had seen how the Calabrian mafia, the ‘Ndrangheta, had enriched itself by quietly infiltrating and investing in legitimate businesses. Messina Denaro put his dirty money into clean energy, using an unknown electrician as a front to build a wind-power empire worth €1.5bn. He created a €700m chain of 83 shops through another frontman. Investigators became suspicious about various builders and salami-makers who were suddenly making millions through slot machines, stolen archaeological treasures, transport hubs, building companies and tourist resorts and so they began arresting those they suspected of being fronts for the Sicilian “Scarlet Pimpernel”. In 2011 alone, they arrested 140 suspected sidekicks and frontmen, a few of whom flipped and gave investigators insights into Messina Denaro’s business empire. But the man himself remained elusive. Investigators didn’t even know what he looked like. There was only a photograph from 1993 which had been artificially aged. The operation to locate him was called Tramonto (“sunset”), named after a poem written by the nine-year-old Nadia who had been killed in Florence. The breakthrough came when wiretaps of his relatives revealed Messina Denaro had colon cancer. Investigators obtained lists of all patients aged over 55 undergoing oncological treatment for the disease in the provinces of Agrigento, Palermo and Trapani. Giuseppe di Matteo, who was murdered on Messina Denaro’s watch. Photograph: public domain Of the possible matches, one stood out: Andrea Bonafede was the name of a man on the fringes of the mafia and it emerged that when he was supposed to be on the operating table in Palermo, his phone actually revealed his presence in Campobello di Mazara, near Trapani. The obvious conclusion was that Bonafede had lent his identity to someone who couldn’t reveal their own. On 29 December, “Bonafede” booked an appointment in the Palermo clinic for 16 January and when, last Monday morning, the real Bonafede remained at home, the authorities decided to act. But despite the initial euphoria at the capture of the famous fugitive, details of his life on the run have shocked the country in the last week. Looking surprisingly similar to the artificially aged photograph, Messina Denaro was living openly in Campobello di Mazara, next to his birthplace in Castelvetrano. He used to go regularly to the local bar, pizzeria and even, according to reports, to Palermo’s football stadium. The Viagra found in his flat suggests he had company. One doctor who was treating him took selfies as if he knew he was in the presence of a star. In a town of just over 11,000 people, Messina Denaro was referred for treatment by a GP (known to be a member of a local masonic lodge) who presumably knew the real Bonafede. “He was hiding in plain sight,” says Federico Varese, a professor of criminology at the University of Oxford, and author of Mafia Life. “It is extraordinary and disconcerting that it took 30 years to arrest this man and that speaks to one fact: there was no help from local informants because of a deep mistrust of people in this part of Italy towards institutions of the state.” Another former fugitive, mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano, was able to elude capture for 43 years. But more than just the passive omertà, or silence, of the local community, many investigators spoke last week about active collusion. Pasquale Angelosanto, the commander of the elite troops behind the Tramonto operation, lamented how the long hunt had been “marked by politicians, law enforcement officers and state officials being arrested or investigated for warning the boss that the circle was closing in”. Repeatedly authorities thought an arrest was imminent, only to be foiled at the last minute: on one occasion, police burst into the suspected meeting place in Bagheria where Messina Denaro was thought to be meeting one of his lovers, Maria Masi. They found only fresh caviar, a scarf, a bracelet, Merit cigarettes and a jigsaw, all hastily abandoned. It is extraordinary it took 30 years to arrest this man: there was no help from local informants who mistrust the state Federico Varese, criminologist and author The suspicion of an overlap between institutional figures and organised crime has deepened in recent months: in December last year, Antonio D’Alì – a former under-secretary at the interior ministry during Silvio Berlusconi’s 2001-06 government – was convicted for “external complicity with the mafia”. Both Messina Denaro and his father had worked for the D’Alì family. In September 2022, Totò Cuffaro, a former governor of the island who spent almost five years in prison for “aiding and abetting” Cosa Nostra and breaching investigative secrecy, stood for re-election. His party or “list” won five seats in the regional assembly. In an on-going trial, many other politicians stand accused of negotiating with the mafia in those crisis years of 1992-93. The faint hope that the captured man might collaborate with the authorities and reveal some of the secrets of that dark period has also receded. The decision to appoint his niece, a notorious defender of mafiosi, as his lawyer suggests he will not make any revelations or confessions. Nor is there much hope that the organisation will be significantly weakened. “Mafias are not reducible to their ‘bosses’,” wrote Luigi Ciotti, a lifelong anti-mafia campaigner, last week: “[they have] developed into a lattice of organisations capable of making up for the disappearance of one individual through the strength of the system.” “The longevity of this criminal organisation is extraordinary,” says Varese. “It has been around since the 1830s, far longer than most businesses. We need to ask what is being done to get rid us not just of the head, but of the root causes of the mafia.” Tobias Jones lives in Parma.

After delicious plates of handmade pasta – coated in the kind of silky, cheesy sauce that only the Italians know how to do – and succulent pork cheek, our host, Alessia, suggests we might like to explore what lies beneath the restaurant. Following her downstairs, we discover an extraordinary tangle of underground passageways, caves and staircases that date back more than 2,500 years, to when the Etruscans first began to dig a network of wells, cellars and tunnels into the soft volcanic rock. Many of Italy’s hilltop towns have caverns and cellars beneath, but few can match the extraordinary honeycomb that lies under Orvieto. The old town (as opposed to the new, Orvieto Scalo, which sprawls across the valley below) is built on an isolated outcrop of tufa rock, with medieval palazzos, the 50m-high clock tower, Torre del Moro, and breathtaking 13th-century cathedral rising up like cut-outs, set above some fantastical, floating land. I first encountered Orvieto when I came to Italy to scout for locations for my new novel, The Enemy of Love, and fell instantly for its atmospheric streets and the hidden world below. Left untouched by the war, when the German and Allied commanders agreed to stage the battle for Orvieto 30km away, much of the city looks as it would have done centuries ago – narrow alleyways flanked by thick stone walls and shuttered palazzos, restaurants, cafés and boutiques housed beneath medieval arches and in Etruscan caves. Purple patch: wisteria in bloom in historical old town of Orvieto. Photograph: Getty Images It may be steeped in history, but that’s not to say Orvieto is stuck in the past. The long main street, corso Cavour, is dotted with boutiques and familiar Italian brands, slotted in between cafés, bars and trattoria that all spill out on to the streets, with waiters running neat piles of strangozzi, the local pasta, and giant discs of pizza out from the kitchen to the alfresco tables, set wherever the narrow streets allow. Any visit to Orvieto should begin with the extraordinary, liquorice-striped cathedral, which took 300 years to build and has one of the most beautiful facades in the whole of Italy. Inside, the vast space is pleasingly free of the baroque ornateness that characterises so many Italian churches; on a hot day it’s a wonderfully airy space to sit and ponder just how such a spectacular and intricate building was created over 300m above the plains. Equally worth a visit, although notably less spacious, is the Pozzo di San Patrizio, a 50m-deep well, encircled with two spiral staircases that never meet. Constructed in 1527 to ensure water was still accessible in case of siege, it’s another example of the mind-blowing engineering and design that underpins the town. Cafe culture: one of the many atmospheric places to stop for a bite. Photograph: Alamy Alongside Orvieto’s rich heritage, there’s an indulgent foodie culture with an emphasis on truffles and wild boar, often used to make ragu. By day, the city’s hub is Montanucci, a big, bustling café, where glass cabinets are heaped with biscuits, pastries, tarts and flans and the hot bar does excellent pastas served canteen style. But it’s in the early evening when Orvieto is at its best. Daytrippers have disappeared into their coaches and the streets are filled with local families, taking a pre-supper passeggiata. My favourite spot to sit and soak it all up is the Bottega Vera, a pocket-sized wine bar where every glass comes with a slate of savoury snacks, and as much information on the grape, vineyard and maker as you want to know. On hotter evenings, there’s Pasqualetti, just a few doors along, for a scoop of ice-cream so meltingly rich it’s almost a fondant. One of the many joys of Orvieto is its border location, making it easy to discover the highlights of both Lazio and Umbria. A favourite trip is Lake Bolsena, where the waterfront is lined with restaurants and cafés, and it feels a little cooler even on the hottest days. There are other hilltop towns within easy reach – Montefiascone is a particular highlight, with its vast duomo and lively central piazza – and Rome is an easy 90-minute hop on the train for a day trip. But, for me, nowhere quite beats Orvieto, a truly extraordinary city, both above ground and far below it.

We had decided we would spend no more than €100 each day on accommodation, food and transport. For the first few weeks of our trip, which we began in Italy, this was entirely possible. We walked everywhere until we developed blisters and our feet bled. We stayed at hotels and bed and breakfasts, described as “rustic” and “charming” in online listings, though they were anything but. We carb-loaded to stay full: pastries for breakfast, paninis and panzerotti for lunch and pizza and pasta for dinner. We were having a wonderful time, despite the havoc the lack of fruit or vegetables was wreaking on our digestive systems. But as we prepared to leave Italy and head to Croatia, we were struck with our first budgetary dilemma. Do we spend €200 each on a one-hour flight from Rome to Split, or €110 for a combined 15-hour train and ferry journey? Given the latter also involved a meal and a night’s accommodation in a cabin that promised “outside views”, we decided to give it a go. Related: A local’s guide to Split, Croatia: a city that marches on its stomach We arrived at “passport control”, which entailed a woman having a cursory glance at our documents and directing us to place our baggage in the scanner. The first red flag was the spiderwebs on the machine. The woman shoved our baggage through the stationary conveyer belt and we were cleared to head to the pier. The second red flag was how few travellers had gathered. The ship was huge – I later Googled it and found it had an occupancy of more than 1,000 – but there were about two dozen of us. It was early June, so not yet peak season, I explained to my boyfriend. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning In hindsight, most travellers probably read the horrifically bad TripAdvisor reviews and steered clear. (A recent reviewer said swimming the Adriatic Sea or walking for days on end through northern Italy and Slovenia to get to Croatia were both better options than catching this ferry service.) As we rode the lift from the car deck to the passenger lounge, it was as if we hopped into a time machine, though it was unclear what era we had arrived in. The lounge was carpeted a deep red – though there was no hiding the stains – and there was a curved, wooden bar in the centre, surrounded by matching wooden tables and red swivel chairs. There were a couple of old box TVs bolted to the walls, which we were told by the man attending the bar – who bore an uncanny resemblance to the Roger Moore-era Bond villain Jaws – would be switched on to play the latest Euro match. There was apparently wifi but we could not find it. Related: Summer holidays: is it cheaper to go to the UK, France or Spain? In the adjacent room, there was a cafeteria with linoleum flooring and blue plastic chairs that matched the blue plastic tablecloths, where we ate the only dish on offer: a very sloppy spaghetti bolognese served on a steel tray. Later, we learned there was a dining room with white tablecloths and leather chairs serving three courses, though no one was eating there. Nearby, there was a ballroom, with a disco ball and colourful, sparkling lights synchronised to music, though there wasn’t a soul on the dancefloor. I can’t even begin to describe the bathrooms. The hallway to our cabin, which featured a bunk bed, a plastic-covered window obstructing any “outside views” and a handheld shower head hanging over the toilet, was similarly empty. The only staff members we saw during the journey were Jaws and the two people working the cafeteria. The music playing throughout the ship was on a loop. “I feel like we’re in The Shining,” my boyfriend whispered to me, though there was no one else around. We’d been on the boat for less than two hours. We went back to the lounge and watched the Euro on the grainy TV – under the watchful gaze of Jaws – then decided to bunk down in our cabin. We put a chair against the door for safety purposes, though all that would have done was warn us of impending doom, given there was nowhere for us to run. We made it through the evening, skipped the cafeteria’s breakfast and disembarked in Zadar, not Split, where we were ripped off by a taxi driver for a five-minute drive to the bus station, then forced to pay extra to place our luggage on the bus. We are planning another trip to Europe this year. We have loosened the budget and instituted a ban on overnight ferries.","Id":"lifeandstyle/2023/jan/20/my-bad-trip-we-wanted-a-charming-money-saver-but-the-overnight-ferry-was-the-shining-on-the-sea","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webTitle":"My bad trip – we wanted a charming money-saver but the overnight ferry was The Shining on the sea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/20/my-bad-trip-we-wanted-a-charming-money-saver-but-the-overnight-ferry-was-the-shining-on-the-sea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/20/my-bad-trip-we-wanted-a-charming-money-saver-but-the-overnight-ferry-was-the-shining-on-the-sea","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":789,"webPublicationDate":"2023-01-19T22:04:10Z","id":"lifeandstyle/2023/jan/20/my-bad-trip-we-wanted-a-charming-money-saver-but-the-overnight-ferry-was-the-shining-on-the-sea","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"The rise in global inflation – the hit to living standards across the world","body":"After decades lurking in the shadows, inflation is back. On Amazon, you can find fridge magnets printed with words spoken 40 years ago by Ronald Reagan, before the election that swept him into the White House. “Inflation is as violent as a mugger, as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hit man.” Price spirals remain a real fear for many Americans, particularly those who lived through the double-digit inflation suffered under Reagan’s predecessor Jimmy Carter. What was a painful but distant memory is now a new reality. And it is global. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced on Thursday that the consumer price index rose year on year by 7.5% in January, a level not seen since the 1980s. Britain is not far behind, with prices rising by 5.4% at the end of last year. In the eurozone – the 19 countries using the euro – it hit 5.1% in January, the highest level since records began in 1997. Here, the Guardian’s foreign correspondents report on how inflation is denting living standards around the world. US People shop at an outdoor food market in Manhattan, NYC. Inflation is causing US consumer prices to increase solidly in the past few months on items such as food, rent, cars and other goods. Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images For years New Yorkers looking for a cheap eat have been able to rely on a $1 slice of pizza. Not for long. As inflation soars even the cheap slice is under pressure and many of the city’s famous pizza shops are imposing price hikes to combat rising costs for everything from tomato sauce and pepperoni to labour and cardboard pizza boxes. US inflation hit its fastest pace since 1982 in January, pushing prices up at a 7.5% annual rate, the third straight month in which inflation exceeded an annualised rate of 6%. Supply chain issues coupled with rising demand continue to inflate the price of fuel, rent, food, and other essentials. The average price of a used car in the US was $28,205 (£20,782) at the end of December, according to Cox Automotive, the first time the median price of a second-hand vehicle has surpassed $28,000. Price rises have hit everyone but inflation hits poorer Americans hardest. The lowest-earning fifth of Americans already spend 83% of their income on housing, according to the labor department’s Consumer Expenditure Survey, and can ill-afford increases in rents, let alone fuel, food, and other essentials. The Federal Reserve is now preparing to raise interest rates in the hope of taming soaring prices. But with inflation surging worldwide it remains to be seen how soon, or whether, the central bank will succeed. Dominic Rushe in New York Italy A petrol station in Rome. Rising fuel prices are a key boost to inflation. Photograph: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock Italians have been feeling the knock-on effects of inflation mostly in their utilities bills, with gas and electricity costs rising by more than 50% this winter. In turn, the high energy costs have made it more expensive to run factories and transport goods, hence price rises have also been felt in other areas, such as food and manufactured goods. Preliminary data from Istat, Italy’s statistics agency, earlier this month showed inflation rose by 3.9% during 2021, hitting 4.2% in December – the highest rise in over a decade. The Bank of Italy predicts inflation at 2.8% this year, although businesses are forecasting higher price rises at 3.2%. Italy has not produced nuclear energy for more than three decades and is extremely dependent on energy imports. “We are highly dependent on imported energy, hence why from this point of view Italy is more vulnerable than other countries,” said Marcello Messori, an economics professor at Luiss University in Rome. “In the short term, there will be a great impact on utilities’ bills,” he added, while forecasting that Europe’s green and digital transition plan could impact prices further down the line. “I am in favour of the two transitions but in Europe we are under-assessing the possible medium-term impact.” Angela Giuffrida in Rome Germany A farmer digs rows for potatoes in parched soil near Luckau, Germany. Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images Inflation in Germany is currently around 4.9%, down on December’s 5.3% – which was only the second time it has exceeded 5% since reunification in 1990 – and is expected to remain high at least until the middle of the year. The Bundesbank referred to a ‘consistent extremely high price pressure’ in its January monthly report. There are multiple reasons behind the inflation rate, including supply chain issues, price rises to reflect losses linked to the pandemic, high demand for specific goods and services coupled with a labour shortage, as well as a rise in the VAT rate, after it was temporarily reduced to help businesses last year. The most shocking hikes are for heating, petrol, diesel, electricity, and oil – which according to the consumer price index have increased on average by 18.3%, butin some cases by as much as 50%. On the grocery bill, consumers are paying around 6% more, but with big differences between goods. Potatoes are the big surprise, having risen by around 43% year on year, mainly due to bad weather conditions. Other food stuffs such as tomatoes, salad, milk, salad, onions and eggs have recorded considerable price rises of between 5% and 20%. In general, imports to Germany have increased in price by around 21% – the steepest rise since 1980 – mainly due to supply chain issues linked to the pandemic. While wages are expected to rise too, with trade unions insisting on appropriate increases , lower-income families are being hardest hit. Despite a 20% rise in the minimum wage, many are not expected to feel enough of a lift to be able to make up for the higher cost of living. Kate Connolly in Berlin Australia A pedestrian passes the Reserve Bank of Australia head office in Sydney. Photograph: Flavio Brancaleone/AAP For a commodity-based economy, Australia faces more of an uphill battle to keep a lid on prices than most. Consumer inflation accelerated at the end of 2021 to 3.5%, while the underlying rate watched by the central bank – Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) – rose to its highest level since mid-2014 at 2.6%. Record high fuel prices were one factor. The RBA’s monk-like forbearance to resist lifting the official cash rate from its record low 0.1% until wages start to rise at least 3% annually will be under the spotlight with financial markets already pricing in the first hike in rates by June. By next February, the rate could be as high as 1.25%, futures indicate. A rate-rise delay until June, though, would at least avoid embarrassing the federal government, which must hold a national election on or before 21 May. Private economists are less hawkish but doubt the RBA can hold off beyond August. One issue to watch is whether the jobless rate dips below 4% which would be the lowest since 1974 although there are many reasons why wages growth may remain restrained including the relatively weak bargaining position of labour. Peter Hannam in Sydney Pakistan With inflation running at 13%, with the Pakistan rupee devaluing rapidly. Photograph: Aamir Qureshi/AFP/Getty Images The global wave of inflation has brought Pakistan to its knees. The rate soared to 13% in January, just as the national currency, the rupee, is rapidly devaluing. Food prices have skyrocketed by 17%, leaving lower- and middle-income families, who already spent half their income on food, struggling to cope. The country has recorded a recent 5% rise in the price of potatoes, a 4.5% rise in the price of chicken and a 2.5% rise in the cost of bananas. The price of cooking oil has risen by 27% in the past three years and sugar now costs more than fuel. In January, for the first time in Pakistan’s history, petrol hit 150 rupees a litre (63 pence), a hike of around 40%. Local policy decisions have aggravated global pressures. The government has agreed cost-cutting measures with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in order to secure a $6bn bailout, which includes levies on petrol and higher energy tariffs and higher taxes. The cost of electricity in Pakistan is already double that of its neighbours India and Bangladesh. Amid mass discontent and anger at the now unaffordable cost of living, Prime Minister Imran Khan recently said that the impact of inflation “kept me up at night” but insisted it was a “global phenomenon”. An anti-inflation protest march is now being planned by the political opposition.

Draghi told a press conference on Thursday that the country needed to act quickly to avoid the kind of infection levels that are being seen in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, as well as to protect the economy. From 6 August, entry to stadiums, museums, theatres, cinemas, exhibition centres, swimming pools and gyms will only be allowed upon presentation of a “green pass”. The pass, which is an extension of the EU’s digital Covid certificate, will also be required in order to be served indoors at restaurants. Italy covid cases Nightclubs will remain closed, while a proposal to make the pass obligatory for travelling within the country by train, plane or long-distance bus is expected to be re-evaluated in September. Draghi said Italy’s economy had been improving alongside an accelerated vaccine programme that has led to a significant fall in the number of Covid-related deaths and hospitalisations since the country started easing lockdown restrictions in late April. “But the Delta variant is threatening. It spreads much more quickly than other variants,” he said. “I invite all Italians to get vaccinated and to do so straight away. Without vaccinations, we’d have to close everything again.” The pass will be available to those who have had at least one vaccine dose. The pass will also be available to anyone who presents proof of a negative test taken within 48 hours before accessing any of the activities under restriction, and to those who have recently recovered from Covid-19. On Thursday, Italy registered 5,057 new coronavirus infections, mostly caused by the Delta variant, compared with 4,259 the day before. There were 15 more Covid-related deaths, bringing the total to 127,920 – the highest death toll in Europe after the UK. Celebrations after Italy’s victory in the Euro 2020 football championship are believed to have contributed to the recent surge in infections, particularly in Rome, where cases have increased fivefold since 11 July. As of Thursday, 52.83% of the population have been fully vaccinated. However, bookings for jabs in recent weeks have slowed, due either to young people delaying their vaccine until after the summer holidays or to those who have decided against vaccination. Italy has a small but vociferous anti-vaccination movement, which has held several protests in recent months against the green pass initiative. There has been opposition to the scheme from far-right parties. Giorgia Meloni, who leads the opposition Brothers of Italy, said on Thursday that it would “kill the tourism season”. Matteo Salvini, the leader of the Lega, a far-right party and key partner in Draghi’s administration, said earlier this week that a green pass is “fine for stadiums, but not for eating a pizza”. The government is also expected to reintroduce the tiered, colour-coded system of restrictions for Italy’s 20 regions, although decisions will be based on the number of people in hospital or intensive care with Covid-19 per region rather than upon the number of infections. Italy’s state of emergency, which gives greater powers to central government – for example, to impose a lockdown – has been extended until the end of the year.","Id":"world/2021/jul/22/italy-covid-19-green-pass-vaccinations-restrictions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Italy imposes ‘green pass’ restrictions on unvaccinated people","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/22/italy-covid-19-green-pass-vaccinations-restrictions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/jul/22/italy-covid-19-green-pass-vaccinations-restrictions","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":540,"webPublicationDate":"2021-07-22T18:27:19Z","id":"world/2021/jul/22/italy-covid-19-green-pass-vaccinations-restrictions","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Covid live: Italy reports highest daily cases since March; Canada’s Omicron cases ‘could overwhelm Ontario ICUs’","body":"12.28am GMT That’s all for today’s Covid blog. We will be closing this live feed down but please follow along with all the latest coronavirus developments on our new blog here. Updated at 12.31am GMT 12.22am GMT Summary There’s been a flurry of new developments over the past 24 hours so here is a snapshot of the key stories. CDC advisers recommend Pfizer and Moderna vaccines over Johnson & Johnson. The panel cited the risk of rare but sometimes fatal cases of blood clotting as well as a lower level of effectiveness against Covid in the J&J shot. The European Commission says it has struck a deal with US pharmaceutical company Moderna to speed up delivery of its Covid vaccine, particularly with a view to supplying Germany with 10 million doses in December. Denmark broke its daily Covid record for the fourth day running, warning new restrictions were on the horizon. The UK recorded its highest tally of lab-confirmed Covid cases since the pandemic began – for the second day running – with almost 90,000 new infections. Independent SAGE said it’s urging a circuit-breaker lockdown until 24 December. England’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty told MPs hospital admissions could peak above levels seen last winter, before the vaccine roll-out, given Omicron’s infectiousness. Italy reported its highest Covid case rate since 12 March, with 26,109 cases, jumping 90% on three weeks ago. Germany’s health minister Karl Lauterbac warned the country is lacking millions of Covid vaccine doses, imperilling the country’s defence against the highly-mutated Omicron strain. Poland reported its first case of the Omicron variant. In the UK Queen Elizabeth II has cancelled plans for a pre-Christmas family lunch. The R number for Omicron in the UK is estimated to be between 3 and 5, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor at the UK Health and Security Agency, said. Indonesia is urging people not to travel abroad after the country detected its first Omicron case. Sweden is to end vaccine pass exemption for its Nordic neighbours. France is banning British tourists from Saturday amid concern over Omicron cases in the UK. Travel to and from the UK without “compelling reasons” – which does not include travel or business – will be banned. Israel says it is donating 1m Covid vaccines to the UN-backed COVAX program to reach African countries. New Zealand detected its first case of Omicron in an isolation facility. The Welsh government will bring in new restrictions including closing nightclubs and imposing a 2-metre social distancing rule in offices from 27 December UK prime minister Boris Johnson attended a pizza party in No 10 Downing Street during the May 2020 lockdown, a joint investigation by the Guardian and Independent reported. 11.41pm GMT Biden warns of a ‘winter of severe illness and death’ for unvaccinated US president Joe Biden says the unvaccinated face “a winter of severe illness and death” After receiving a briefing on the pandemic from advisers, Biden said the Omicron variant is “now spreading and it’s going to increase”. Biden urged Americans to get vaccinated and get their boosters as soon as possibl, saying:. For the unvaccinated, we are looking at a winter of severe illness and death.” A wave of new Omicron cases is beginning to surge in America and could peak as early as January, the Centers for Disease Controls (CDC) has warned, as states are scrambling to prepare for overloaded hospitals. The Omicron variant accounted for nearly 3% of Covid cases in the US as of Saturday – up from only 0.4% the week before, according to data from the CDC. The variant is expected to continue rising rapidly, based on the experiences of other countries and could be dominant within weeks. “I suspect that those numbers are going to shoot up dramatically in the next couple of weeks,” said Céline Gounder, infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at New York University and Bellevue Hospital, on Wednesday. She expects an Omicron wave to peak in late January and then come down sometime in February. 11.24pm GMT “We are not locking down”, British prime minister Boris Johnson says while denying warnings amount to lockdown by stealth. Johnson said he will not impose a lockdown despite the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. He has insisted the situation in the UK is different from last year because of the widespread availability of vaccines and tests. “The sensible thing to do is to get a test and to make sure that you’re being cautious,” Johnson said, adding that businesses should remain open. 10.59pm GMT Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you on the blog as my colleague Tom Ambrose takes a well-deserved break. I’ll be reporting to you from Sydney so let’s dive in with some Covid numbers out of Australia. The country’s most populous state of NSW has recorded a record 2,213 new Covid cases and one death while Victoria recorded 1,510 cases and 7 deaths. Here’s what we know so far about Omicron’s spread in Australia. default 10.44pm GMT The Welsh government will bring in new restrictions including closing nightclubs and imposing a 2-metre social distancing rule in offices from 27 December to try to combat the Omicron variant and has issued “strong guidance” over how to stay safe over Christmas. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, said the new legally enforceable regulations were needed to counter what he called the most serious development in the pandemic to date. Drakeford is strongly advising people to celebrate the festive season only with their nearest and dearest, saying a “smaller Christmas” will be a safer one. From the day after Boxing Day, Wales will introduce fresh legal restrictions, including a 2-metre social distancing rule in offices and putting extra measures in place to protect customers and staff, such as one-way systems and physical barriers. Nightclubs will also close and the government is to make up to £60m available to support businesses affected by the new restrictions. Related: Wales to impose 2-metre rule in offices and close nightclubs from 27 December 10.02pm GMT The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has started distributing free Covid home test kits to international travellers, the agency said. The CDC said it began distributing the kits on Wednesday and is giving them out at Minneapolis-St Paul, Miami and Chicago O’Hare and will soon add Dallas-Fort Worth. It plans to add four additional unidentified international airports in the coming weeks. The CDC encourages - but does not mandate - international air travelers to get a new Covid test upon arriving in the United States. New rules took effect on 6 December to require nearly all people flying to the United States to obtain a negative test within one day of travel. 9.05pm GMT CDC panel votes to recommend mRNA Covid vaccines over J&J's A panel of advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have voted to recommend Americans choose to receive one of the other two authorised Covid vaccines over Johnson & Johnson’s shot, due to rare but sometimes fatal cases of blood clotting. Reuters reported: The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization voted unanimously to make the recommendation. The regulator still needs to sign off on the guidance. Cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), which involves blood clots accompanied by a low level of platelets, have previously been reported in recipients of the J&J vaccine. The highest reporting rates are in women under 50. The CDC said that the rate of such incidents is higher than previously estimated, both in women and men. At least nine people have died following the blood clotting incidents in the United States, the CDC has said. Members of the panel also said J&J’s vaccine is less effective in preventing COVID-19 than the other two authorized vaccines. In a presentation to the committee, a leading J&J vaccine scientist said the vaccine generates a strong and long-lasting immune response with just a single shot.

In a statement posted on Facebook, a spokesperson said: Due to the current public health status we have evaluated the potential impact of shows for our guests, staff, artists and partners. Given the time of year, it’s also important to take into account the potential impact on festive celebrations for individuals and families, especially those who were impacted last year. For that reason, we have had to make the unfortunate decision to postpone this weekend’s Printworks shows.

Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images 7.39pm GMT The emergence of the Omicron variant has made it clear the pandemic won’t be over until it is beaten everywhere. But there has been a vast and continuing inequality in the global Covid vaccine rollout. This mirrors other rollouts, such as the vaccine for diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and tetanus, which has a vaccination rate as low as 41% in some countries. In the case of Covid, inequality has been compounded by wealthy nations buying up doses, and the need to ramp up adult vaccination programs in countries that hadn’t had them before. This map shows how the Covid vaccine rollout has progressed globally, showing the number of doses administered per 100 people over time.

The force said it was aware of a gathering at an address in Matthew Parker Street in London, where the Conservative party headquarters is based, on 14 December 2020. The party was organised by Shaun Bailey’s London mayoral campaign team. On Wednesday, Bailey stepped down from an official role in the London assembly after a photograph emerged of him joining a throng of people at the party amid the Covid lockdown in December last year. Bailey has apologised “unreservedly” for the event. The Met did not say who they were seeking to contact. In a statement, the force said: “Officers will be making contact with two people who attended in relation to alleged breaches of the health protection (coronavirus restrictions) regulations.” The Met also said it is looking into staff gatherings at 10 Downing Street and the Department for Education in November and December 2020 and is in contact with the Cabinet Office, but will not open an investigation at this time.

ICU capacity in Ontario, Canada could be overwhelmed by Omicron within weeks without action, a panel of experts said. Denmark broke its daily Covid record for the fourth day running, with the prime minister Mette Frederiksen warning new restrictions were on the horizon. The UK recorded its highest tally of lab-confirmed Covid cases since the pandemic began – for the second day running – with almost 90,000 new infections.

Malawi announced new restrictions to beat back its rising cases and announced a vaccine mandate for frontline workers such as healthcare staff. France reported 60,866 new Covid cases, up 45% from three weeks ago. The government also announced a ban on non-essential travel to and from Britain to try and block the spread of Omicron. Palestine detected its first three Omicron cases in the occupied West Bank, the health ministry said. AstraZeneca said its Evusheld antibody cocktail appears effective against Omicron in the first study conducted. Portugal said it will extend border restrictions beyond the initial 9 January deadline, mandating negative tests for entry even for double-vaccinated travelers. UK prime minister Boris Johnson attended a pizza party in No 10 Downing Street during the May 2020 lockdown, a joint investigation by the Guardian and Independent reported, with members of a group for bereaved families attacking Johnson’s attendance as “disgusting.” Poland reported its first Omicron case from a 30-year-old woman who flew in from southern Africa. She currently feels well but is in hospital isolation. The UK’s Queen Elizabeth II cancelled a pre-Christmas lunch with her family over surging Omicron cases, despite palace insiders insisting on Tuesday the event would go ahead. Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon also urged the Scottish public to stay home. Sweden is to end a vaccine pass exemption for its Nordic neighbours, authorities said. Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo urged people not to travel abroad after the country detected its first Omicron case. That’s all from me, Jem Bartholomew here in London, for today. I’ll be back on Sunday – drop me an email or message me on Twitter with tips and stories for then. Now I’m handing over to my colleague Tom Ambrose for the next few hours. Updated at 7.14pm GMT 6.41pm GMT The UK campaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice has said that it is “disgusting” that prime minister Boris Johnson attended a pizza party in Downing Street on 15 May last year while the UK was still under lockdown. “I remember 15 May 2020 very well. That’s because while Boris Johnson was at this party I was sitting in a hospital with my dad dying in intensive care,” said Hannah Brady, a spokesperson for the group. “We had to fight to see Dad and sat there for 5 hours with him. We just didn’t want him to die alone. When he stabilised we were told to go home. He died the next day.” “To know that I was sitting in the hospital while the prime minister and his colleagues were drinking at a party, breaking the same rules the rest of the country were following, just makes me sick to my stomach”, she said. It comes after a joint investigation by the Guardian and Independent revealed Johnson had attended the event for 15 minutes, sources allege, while rules then said only two people from different households could meet outside, at a distance of 2 metres. The group have become staunch critics of the British government’s handling of the pandemic and are seeking “core participant” status in the public inquiry that will take place under Baroness Hallett. Brady added: “My dad was only 55 and he was fit and healthy. He worked in the Heinz factory, and he carried on working during lockdown because he was proud to be a key worker helping to keep the UK fed. I wanted some good to come of his sacrifice. But when me and other Covid-bereaved families called for a rapid review inquiry over summer 2020 – so that lessons could be learned to protect other families ahead of the second wave – we were told again and again that staff were too busy tackling the virus. Now we know what that looked like.” “What makes it hurt even more is that when I met the prime minister some months later, I showed him a photo of dad in the hospital, taken on the same day that we now know this party took place. The prime minister looked me in the eye and told me he’d ‘done everything he could’ to protect my Dad. It’s disgusting.” Updated at 6.42pm GMT 6.28pm GMT France reported 60,866 new Covid infection in the past 24 hour, down slightly on yesterday but climbing 45% from 33,464 three weeks ago today. A further 165 people died from Covid-relates causes on Thursday, jumping 129% from 72 daily deaths three weeks ago. It comes after France banned non-essential travel to and from Britain from Friday at 11pm GMT to reduce the spread of the Omicron strain. As of Wednesday France had reported 170 Omicron cases. “Our strategy is to delay as much as we can the development of Omicron in our country and take advantage to push ahead with the booster drive,” government spokesman Gabriel Attal told local media.

Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images 6.07pm GMT An update on two antibody treatments, potentially useful tools in the box against Omicron and future mutated variants. AstraZeneca on Thursday said a lab study showed its antibody cocktail, Evusheld, retained neutralising activity against Omicron, the first such data for the treatment. The picture was less rosy for Regeneron, which said on Thursday its Ronapreve therapy is less effective against Omicron, though it is still active against the Delta variant. It comes after the UK’s antiviral taskforce chair Eddie Gray said on Thursday the country will have access to both Merck’s molnupiravir and Pfizer’s paxlovid treatments over winter. Scientists say antibody therapies, alongside vaccines, regular testing and social distancing measures, will be an important weapon in the arsenal fighting the latest Covid wave. 5.46pm GMT In the US the Omicron variant has surpassed Delta in collections taken from wastewater samples in Orange County, Florida, officials said. Despite few confirmed clinical infections, wastewater samples showed the new variant is now the dominant strain. Omicron represented almost 100% of strains from wastewater facilities in a sampling this week, Orange County Utilities spokesperson Sarah Lux told AP. Orange County is home to tourist attractions such as Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando.

It comes after Johnson was accused of hosting an indoor quiz last year during another lockdown, which has rocked his authority in the nation and in his own Conservative party. The prime minister spent about 15 minutes with staff at the alleged social gathering on 15 May 2020, telling one aide they deserved a drink for “beating back” coronavirus, a joint investigation by the Guardian and Independent was told. Rules at the time allowed only two people from different households to meet outside, at a distance of 2 metres. Earlier that evening, Matt Hancock, then health secretary, had urged people to “stay at home as much as is possible”. Read my colleagues’ full story here. Updated at 5.07pm GMT 4.59pm GMT Canada's Omicron infections could overwhlem Ontario ICUs within weeks, panel warns The highly-mutated Omicron variant could swamp intensive care capacity in Ontario, Canada within weeks without action, a panel of experts said on Thursday. “This will likely be the hardest wave of the pandemic. There is still some uncertainty but there is an undeniable urgency,” said Adalsteinn Brown, co-chair of Ontario’s Covid advisory group. “Waiting to take action means waiting until it is too late to take action.” Canada reported 5,810 new Covid cases on Wednesday, an 85% jump from 3,146 infections two weeks beforehand. The panel said vaccination alone would not tackle Omicron. Instead, it called for public health measures – such as restrictions on indoor gatherings – to cut peoples’ contacts by 50% and accelerate booster doses. Ontario province, which contains Toronto, has about 600 ICU beds according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, with a further 500 surge capacity, but 300 patients will cause knock-on impacts across the health system.

The UK has broken its daily Covid tally two days in a row. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA The UK detected a record 88,376 new Covid cases on Thursday, almost 10,000 more than yesterday’s record-breaking tally of 78,610 and jumping 67% from 53,067 two weeks ago. It comes amid warnings from scientists that the UK will keep breaking records as the highly-transmissable Omicron variant rips through the population. A further 146 people died with the virus in the past 24 hours, up from 141 two weeks ago. “In terms of the speed at which things are changing it’s like March 2020, I think you will see policy changing every few days as it grapples to catch up,” Christina Pagel, director of UCL’s Clinical Operational Research Unit and an Independent SAGE member, told me. “We’re going to be breaking records every day for a week at least now – unless we do something.” Pagel and Independent Sage are calling on the government to implement a circuit-breaker lockdown until 24 December. She admits this prospect is unlikely with Christmas imminent and after the backbench rebellion to prime minister Boris Johnson’s Covid measures on Tuesday. “But now is the time we can affect the peak,” she said. “It’s burning through the population.” Pagel said that, despite an early study from the University of Hong Kong suggesting Omicron’s weakened severity, the UK’s outlook is grave. “Even if it’s half as severe it’s moving four times as fast, so you can overwhelm the NHS just from that,” she said. But she does not predict deaths reaching as high as last January, when the population faced surging cases with no wall of immunity. Daily hospital admissions may peak above levels seen last winter, before the vaccine roll-out, England’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty told MPs on Thursday. The 88,376 figure only counts lab-confirmed PCR cases. Pagel said the actual figure is likely to be in the region of 200,000 new daily cases. Updated at 6.20pm GMT 3.45pm GMT Malawi tightens Covid restrictions and announces frontline worker vaccine mandate Malawi said it was tightening restrictions and would make Covid vaccines mandatory for frontline staff like healthcare workers after a jump in coronavirus cases. The government limited gatherings to a maximum of 100 people indoors and 250 people outdoors, Reuters reported. The country recorded 318 confirmed Covid infections on Wednesday, up from 5 cases three weeks ago. Malawi also reported its first Omicron cases last week. About 3% of the population is double-vaccinated. The frontline worker directive will commence on 20 December and also includes journalists. Khumbize Kandodo Chiponda, the health minister, said today: “Uptake of vaccines has not been high enough towards reaching our goal of vaccinating at least 60% of eligible Malawians by the end of next year. The vaccine remains our best preventive tool. “Accumulating data is continuing to indicate that the majority of those being admitted to our emergency treatment units or losing their lives to Covid-19 have not been vaccinated.” Updated at 3.51pm GMT 3.26pm GMT Another brilliant dispatch from Ed Yong at the Atlantic published this morning, as the US stares down rising Omicron cases. Read the full story here. Even if Omicron is milder, greater transmissibility will likely trump that reduced virulence. Omicron is spreading so quickly that a small proportion of severe cases could still flood hospitals. To avert that scenario, the variant would need to be substantially milder than Delta – especially because hospitals are already at a breaking point. Two years of trauma have pushed droves of health-care workers, including many of the most experienced and committed, to quit their job. ... The Omicron wave won’t completely topple America’s wall of immunity but will seep into its many cracks and weaknesses. It will find the 39% of Americans who are still not fully vaccinated (including 28% of adults and 13 percent of over-65s). It will find other biologically vulnerable people, including elderly and immunocompromised individuals whose immune systems weren’t sufficiently girded by the vaccines. It will find the socially vulnerable people who face repeated exposures, either because their “essential” jobs leave them with no choice or because they live in epidemic-prone settings, such as prisons and nursing homes. Omicron is poised to speedily recap all the inequities that the US has experienced in the pandemic thus far. \uD83D\uDEA8Well, I wrote about Omicron--what we know & what it means. I feel the core problem is unchanged: The variant poses a much greater threat at the societal level than the individual one, making it the kind of problem the US has consistently flubbed. 1/ https://t.co/IRZqSbvC69 — Ed Yong (@edyong209) December 16, 2021 3.03pm GMT In England, Saturday’s Premier League football match between Manchester United and Brighton has been postponed because of Covid outbreaks. A small number of United players and staff returned positive rapid tests on Sunday, reported by the Athletic. Brighton has been dealing with “three or four” positive tests among its squad. The Premier League is likely to face further postponements as the Omicron variant takes hold in the UK. Sport is being disrupted across the world as coronavirus cases rise in many jurisdictions. In the US, an NBA Bulls game was postponed on Monday over an outbreak, Axios reported, and the NFL said it had a record 37 players testing positive on Monday.

Denmark’s State Serum Institute said 9,999 cases were recorded in the last 24 hours, a record high, a 128% increase on 4,390 cases three weeks ago. “The infection is – unfortunately, as expected – very, very high. Authorities will provide a status later today. And I have no doubt that new measures will be needed to break the chains of infection,” Frederiksen said on Facebook. “The Epidemic Commission is preparing, and as soon as we can say more, of course we will. The most important thing is still getting 3 [vaccines]. The sooner the better,” she added. It comes after the UK reported record daily case numbers on Wednesday.

Lauterbach said that Germany was on schedule to receive just 1.2m doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine to distribute to vaccine centres and doctors’ practices across the country next week, 800,000 the following week and a further 1.2m the week after. “But this is far less than the amounts which doctors are asking for every week.” He said Germany was scraping the barrel of its reserves. “The campaign has to roll ... but there is literally no more than this there,” he said. His warning came as the country’s vaccine campaign, seen to have flagged in recent months, picked up a pace, with a record number of 1.5m doses having been administered on Wednesday, bringing up to 70% the number who are now double-vaccinated, and to almost 28% those who have received a booster jab. Currently the Delta variant is making up around 90% of German infections. However, the more infectious Omicron variant has been detected and is expected to spread widely next month. Lauterbach, an epidemiologist, who as the health spokesman for the Social Democrats was an active and much relied upon commentator on the pandemic before taking over as health minister from the Christian Democrats’ (CDU) Jens Spahn this month, said he was seeking “as an emergency to buy back” millions of unused vaccine stocks from eastern European countries. His ministry has confirmed reports that it plans to spend ¢2.2bn on 80m BioNTech doses, via official European Union procurement channels, and to buy a further 12 million doses directly, to ensure, it said, “that we can start the new year in a sensible manner”. The first cases of the new, far more infectious Omicron variant have been detected in Germany, but the new wave it is not expected to sweep the country until next month.

Some European Union member states, , in particular Germany, are facing a short-term need amid the rapid spread of the highly transmissable strain. Moderna agreed to deliver 10m doses to Germany in December, and 25m extra doses to Germany in the first quarter of 2022. A study published by the LKS Faculty of Medicine at The University of Hong Kong said Omicron grows 70 times faster in the bronchus than the Delta variant, but the virus replicated less effectively in lung tissue, suggesting less severe disease. (The study is still being peer reviewed.)

Sweden’s social affairs minister, Lena Hallengren, also encouraged all travellers to be tested for the coronavirus upon entry due to a “deteriorating” public health situation. “The spread of infection is increasing sharply. The new virus variant Omicron makes it difficult to predict the spread of infection in the future,” she said. So far, the Swedish government has not resorted to lockdowns or business closures during the pandemic, with authorities instead emphasising individual responsibility. Hallengren said that it was acceptable for people who are fully vaccinated and healthy to celebrate Christmas with friends and relatives, but told them to “be prepared to cancel if you get symptoms.” She urged Swedes to “choose a smaller party” for celebrating New Year.

Updated at 12.16pm GMT 10.07am GMT France calls on people to 'postpone' travel to the UK France has called on people who had planned to visit the UK to “postpone their travel”. In a statement, released today, the French government said: In the face of the extremely rapid spread of the Omicron variant in the United Kingdom, the government has chosen to reinstate compelling reasons for travel to and from the United Kingdom, and to strengthen the requirement for testing on departure and arrival. In the UK government’s own words, the UK will face a ‘tidal wave’ linked to the Omicron variant in the coming days. Thus, from midnight into Saturday, the following rules will apply for travel between the United Kingdom and France: A requirement to have a compelling reason to travel to or from the United Kingdom, for unvaccinated and vaccinated people. These reasons are indicated [here]. They will not allow travel for tourism or business reasons. However, these compelling reasons will not apply to French nationals and their spouses and children who are still able to come to France. It added: Vaccinated people must present a negative test (PCR or TAG) of less than 24 hours, which is in line with the rules already in place for unvaccinated people. An obligation for all travellers from the United Kingdom to register, prior to their trip, on a digital platform and provide the address of their stay in France. This platform will generate prefectural orders for all travellers, whether unvaccinated as vaccinated, to isolate in a place of their choosing. This isolation requirement may be lifted after 48 hours, subject to proof of a negative test (PCR or TAG). Controls will be organised to ensure the proper implementation of these measures. The government also calls on travellers who had planned to visit the United Kingdom to postpone their travel. Updated at 10.41am GMT 9.52am GMT Here’s more from AFP on the French travel ban on UK visitors, which will come into force from midnight on Saturday (or 11pm GMT on Friday). It comes after the UK yesterday reported a record 78,610 Covid cases as Omicron spreads rapidly. France will ban non-essential travel to and from Britain from the weekend to slow the spread of the Omicron Covid-19 variant that is causing record numbers of cases on the other side of the Channel, the government said Thursday. From midnight Saturday (2300 GMT Friday) there will be a “requirement to have an essential reason to travel to, or come from, the UK, both for the unvaccinated and vaccinated ... People cannot travel for touristic or professional reasons,” the government said in a statement. “Faced with the extremely rapid spread of the Omicron variant in the UK, the government has chosen to reinstate the need for an essential reason for travel from and to the UK,” the statement said. It added that French citizens and EU nationals could still return to France from the UK. “We will put in place a system of controls drastically tighter than the one we have already,” the government spokesperson, Gabriel Attal, told BFMTV channel. Attal said the policy was aimed at “tightening the net” to slow down the arrival of Omicron cases in France and give time for the French vaccination booster campaign to make more ground. “Our strategy is to delay as much as we can the development of Omicron in our country and take advantage to push ahead with the booster drive,” he said. In addition, returning travellers will need a negative test less than 24 hours old, and a blanket quarantine would be enforced on return to France. “People [coming back] will have to register on an app and will have to self-isolate in a place of their choosing for seven days – controlled by the security forces – but this can be shortened to 48 hours if a negative test is carried out in France,” he said. Updated at 10.40am GMT 9.46am GMT The closure of the French border to tourists is “devastating” for UK citizens who work in the French ski and seasonal businesses sector. Charlie Owen, director of the Season Business in Travel, said: The news coming from France around further travel restriction for UK-France is devastating for the UK Ski Industry. After 21 months of being closed due to the Covid pandemic, this is yet another hammer blow to the industry. The UK government urgently needs to engage with industry leaders and introduce support measures immediately.

A spokesperson added: In the context of an Omicron variant that is passing through the French population as it is in the UK, further border controls seem as unnecessary as they are unwelcome. Updated at 9.45am GMT 9.39am GMT The president of Indonesia has addressed the country after it identified its first Omicron case (see also 03:57). In a public address, Joko Widodo said the government was working hard to stem the spread of the new variant and urged people to follow health protocols and for local governments to speed up testing and contact tracing, reports Reuters. Updated at 10.39am GMT 9.27am GMT The new restrictions on travel between the UK and France will allow British citizens to go to the country only for “compelling reasons” and travellers will be required to present a negative PCR test from within 24 hours before they leave.

Trying to find form! — Kim Willsher (@kimwillsher1) December 16, 2021 Updated at 9.16am GMT 9.03am GMT Agence France-Presse has a few more details about the move to bar UK tourists from entering France: France is to tighten restrictions on travel from Britain to slow the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 that is causing record numbers of cases on the other side of the Channel, the French government has said. “We will put in place a system of controls drastically tighter than the one we have already,” the government spokesperson Gabriel Attal told BFM television, saying the office of the prime minister, Jean Castex, would issue a statement on the new measures in the coming hours. He said travellers coming to France would need a negative test less than 24 hours old, a blanket quarantine would be enforced on return to France, and trips for tourism limited. “We will reduce the validity of the test to come to France from 48 hours to 24 hours,” said Attal. “We will limit the reasons for coming to France from the UK, it will be limited to French nationals and residents and their families. Tourism or business trips for people who do not have French or European nationality or are residents will be limited. “People [coming back] will have to register on an app and will have to self-isolate in a place of their choosing for seven days – controlled by the security forces – but this can be shortened to 48 hours if a negative test is carried out in France.” Related: France to tighten Covid restrictions on travel from Omicron-hit UK Updated at 9.47am GMT 8.53am GMT Brentford FC manager, Thomas Frank, has called for football fixtures in the coming days to be postponed in the UK due to Covid cases, reports Sky News. Updated at 10.38am GMT 8.40am GMT British tourists to be banned from France from Saturday British tourists are to be banned from France from Saturday amid concern over Omicron cases in the UK. France is banning travel to and from the UK without “compelling reasons” – which does not include travel or business – from Saturday morning, reports Sky News. French nationals and their spouses will be exempt from the new rules. It comes after the UK yesterday reported its highest number of Covid cases since the start of the pandemic. Updated at 10.35am GMT 8.35am GMT Only half of people in UK with Covid ever get tested, says scientific adviser, who predicts 'huge wave of infection' A UK government scientific adviser has said that only around half of people who have Covid ever get tested and predicted that Omicron would lead to “a huge wave of infection”. Prof Andrew Hayward, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), told BBC Breakfast: “Only about half or maybe even fewer of people who do have Covid ever get tested.” He said the doubling rate of new variant Omicron would lead to an “extraordinary number of cases” and “a huge wave of infection”. He added: If you think about getting a year’s worth of rain over a month, then you’re going to get flooding and potentially severe flooding, no matter how much you’ve shored up your defences. And that’s the concern here - that that huge wave is going to cause lots of people to be off work having to isolate, which is going to cause disruption, and it’s going to spill over into people going into hospital. Now the rate at which it spills over is uncertain because we don’t know exactly how severe it is yet, but we’ve no particular reason to think that it’s less severe than previous strains. We know that Covid is always going to be less severe if you’ve been immunised but it may be that rather than the strain itself that’s making a lot of cases look less severe. He said that by Christmas or new year there should be more data about the severity of the new variant, but said that by then it would be too late to take action. Asked about current restrictions, he said: I think the scale of the potential problem that we’re looking at here does mean that we need to bite the bullet and we need to tell people that there’s two really important things here. One is to get boosted, the other if we want to slow it down now... Then what we need to do is reduce the number of contacts that we have, we need to avoid crowded spaces with lots of people in and unfortunately, yes, that does mean parties etc. And so that’s a difficult message. 8.24am GMT Wes Streeting, the UK shadow health secretary, has also been on Times Radio, where he said the chancellor should “get himself on a flight back and get a grip on the situation” following reports that he was in California. It comes after the Daily Mirror reported that Rishi Sunak was on a four-day official trip to the US. Streeting said Sunak should come back to the UK to help businesses suffering as a result of soaring Covid cases. He said: We understand the Chancellor is currently out of the country in California. So perhaps he might want to get himself on a flight back and get a grip on the situation because businesses need certainty and confidence now. 8.14am GMT Labour calls on government to work out deal with UK's struggling hospitality industry Labour has called on the government to work out a deal to help the struggling hospitality industry amid soaring cancellations as UK covid infections hit a new record high. Shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that chancellor Rishi Sunak and business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng should meet with businesses and trade unions to offer them more assistance. He said: The chancellor and the business secretary need to get business leaders around the table with trade union leaders to hammer out a deal to help hospitality because, you know, they really need us right now. He added: Those businesses are having a hard time at the moment and we want government to be by their side. He said he was rethinking his own Christmas plans in response, saying he was “not sure what Christmas is going to be like in my house” and that it was a “real dilemma”. I’m going to try and strike the right balance on this I think by, you know, still going out and still trying to enjoy Christmas, still going to see friends and family, but just taking some sensible precautions to do so safely. Updated at 8.15am GMT 8.01am GMT Turkey has declared it will join countries accelerating the schedule for vaccine booster shots to fight the spread of the Omicron variant. Turkey’s health minister Fahrettin Koca said that as a “precaution,” citizens and residents who received their second dose three months ago can now register for boosters. Over 82 percent of Turkish residentshave received two doses of a vaccine according to the Turkish government, primarily Pfizer-Biontech. Turks who were previously vaccinated with Sinovac-Coronavac were offered additional shots of Pfizer-Biontech earlier this year. Turkish officials reported the first cases of the Omicron variant last Saturday, one in Istanbul and five in the southern city of Izmir. The governor of Izmir, Yavuz Selim Köşger, told journalists that none of those infected had “connections abroad,” indicating community spread. 7.58am GMT Leading chef accuses UK government of 'mixed messaging and confusion' on Covid as industry struggles with cancellations Chef Tom Kerridge has accused the UK government of “mixed messaging and confusion” on Covid and called on them to “step up” to help a struggling industry. He told Sky News they had 654 cancellations at one restaurant over six days, adding: “That was a reflection of the industry.” He said cancellations are “coming in thick and fast” and that the industry needs government support. He asked whether Boris Johnson is “playing politics with the hospitality industry and the future of it” and accused the government of being “reactive rather than proactive”. “Where is Rishi Sunak?” he asked. Updated at 7.59am GMT 7.24am GMT Britain's new year booster target 'very ambitious' but government will 'throw everything at it', says UK care minister Care minister, Gillian Keegan, has said Britain’s new year booster target is “very ambitious” but that they plan to “throw everything at it”. She told Sky News that the situation is “hard right now”, but added that with the booster programme: “Hopefully we’ll be through the other side of this quite quickly.” She said the government is not planning to introduce any more Covid restrictions before Christmas and that is up to indivduals to “make a sensible choice for yourself” on Christmas parties. Over 24million people have already been boosted, she said. She said she is “confident” that with the introduction of a second dose for 12-15-year-olds schools will reopen as normal in January and urged teachers to get boosted. Care minister Gillian Keegan says it's \"a very, very ambitious target\" but confirms that everyone who is eligible for a booster jab will be able to get their vaccine by New Year's eve.#KayBurley https://t.co/JDplD9IrwQ pic.twitter.com/YowyT6AZ1b — Sky News (@SkyNews) December 16, 2021 Hi, I’m looking after the blog for the next few hours. Please get in touch with any tips or suggestions: miranda.bryant@guardian.co.uk Updated at 7.37am GMT 7.00am GMT South Africa’s National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC) has retained the coronavirus lockdown at ‘adjusted level 1’, or the lowest of a five-tier system of restrictions, in the battle on the Omicron variant, health authorities said on Thursday, Reuters reports. “The Council has directed the department to closely monitor the rising Covid-19 infections,” the health department said in a statement, adding that it would also track hospital admissions, mortality and recovery rates. These levels were all largely driven by the Omicron variant, which was contributing to South Africa’s fourth wave of infections, it added. The decision followed deliberation by the Council on safety measures recommended by the health department in a bid to prevent any surge in infections during the festive period, it added. 6.54am GMT Israel to donate 1m Covid vaccines to Africa The Israeli government says it is donating 1 million coronavirus vaccines to the UN-backed COVAX program. The Foreign Ministry said the AstraZeneca vaccines would be transferred in the coming weeks, a decision that was part of Israel’s strengthening ties with the African countries, Reuters reports. Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said: I am delighted that Israel can contribute and be a partner in eradicating the pandemic around the world.” The announcement said the vaccines would reach close to a quarter of African countries, though it did not provide a list. Israel has close ties with a number of African nations, including Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda. Israel also established relations with Sudan last year as part of a series of US-brokered accords. 6.35am GMT Summary If you’ve just joined us welcome to our live blog covering all the latest coronavirus developments. Here is a quick snapshot of the leading Covid news stories. Covid cases have risen sharply at some UK universities as students head home, prompting fears that the mass migration could fuel the spread of the virus. Malaysia has announced new Covid-19 restrictions, including banning mass gatherings and requiring booster doses for high-risk groups, as it reported its second case of the Omicron coronavirus variant. Germany is reporting another 56,677 new daily coronavirus cases and 522 deaths, according to the Robert Koch Institute. South Korea has just released its daily Covid report. Another 7,622 confirmed coronavirus cases have been recorded over the last 24 hours with 62 Covid-related deaths. Japan has officially approved Moderna Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine for its booster shot programme that began this month. Malaysia is now requiring all travellers arriving from the United Kingdom to undertake Covid tests everyday during quarantine. Indonesia has just identified its first case of the Omicron coronavirus variant, health minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said on Thursday. Australia’s cricket captain, Pat Cummins, has been ruled out for the second Ashes Test after being identified as a close contact of a positive Covid-19 case. New Zealand has detected its first case of the Omicron Covid-19 variant in a Christchurch managed isolation facility. Thousands marched in New Zealand’s capital Wellington on Thursday to protest against Covid vaccine mandates and lockdowns, as the country announced 90% of its eligible population has been fully vaccinated. The Dutch family family has apologised after it last week invited a reported 21 people to celebrate the 18th birthday of Princess Amalia, the future queen, in breach of coronavirus health guidance. Apple Inc is delaying its return to office plans indefinitely, Bloomberg News reports. People in England have been told to cut down on socialising in the lead-up to Christmas. New Zealand’s health regulator Medsafe has granted provisional approval for the Pfizer Inc Covid-19 vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 years old. South Korea will reinstate social distancing rules and a 9pm curfew for restaurants and cafes to combat spiralling numbers of new infections and hospitalisations. South Africa reported its highest daily tally of new coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic with 26,976 infections and 54 deaths recorded on Wednesday. Updated at 6.38am GMT 6.17am GMT Covid cases rise sharply at some UK universities as students head home The number of Covid cases has risen sharply at some universities as about a million students begin to head home for the Christmas break, prompting fears that the mass migration could fuel the spread of the virus. Students have been urged to take Covid tests before they leave their university to travel to see their families – the vast majority on public transport – and again before they return in the new year, as well as getting their booster vaccinations. But with case numbers increasing rapidly on some campuses, including Omicron infections, there are reports that students have decided to leave early to limit the risk of having to isolate over Christmas away from home. Loughborough University and Imperial College London have moved learning online for most students for the last few days of term after a significant uptick in cases. Elsewhere, universities have urged staff and students to either cancel or scale back planned Christmas celebrations to limit mixing. Read the full story from our reporter Sally Weale here. Related: Covid cases rise sharply at some UK universities as students head home 5.40am GMT Malaysia bans mass New Year events Malaysia has announced new Covid-19 restrictions, including banning mass gatherings and requiring booster doses for high-risk groups, as it reported its second case of the Omicron coronavirus variant. To curb potential Omicron risks, mass New Year gatherings will be banned and those attending private New Year and Christmas celebrations must undergo Covid-19 self-tests, Khairy said. Malaysians over 60, and all adult recipients of the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine, are required to get a booster dose by February to keep their status as “fully vaccinated”, Khairy said. Singapore is considering a similar policy. Malaysia has also temporarily banned the entry of foreign travellers from eight countries and designated nine countries as “high-risk”, including Britain, the United States, Australia and India. All arrivals from these countries must undergo mandatory quarantine and be fitted with digital tracking devices, regardless of their vaccination status. Those from Britain will also be required to conduct daily self-tests during quarantine, Khairy said. 4.49am GMT Germany is reporting another 56,677 new daily coronavirus cases and 522 deaths, according to the Robert Koch Institute. 4.25am GMT South Korea has just released its daily Covid report. Another 7,622 confirmed coronavirus cases have been recorded over the last 24 hours with 62 Covid-related deaths. The numbers are a slight decrease on the 7,850 cases and 70 deaths reported from the day before. Updated at 4.29am GMT 4.18am GMT Japan approves Moderna vaccine for booster shot Japan has officially approved Moderna Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine for its booster shot programme that began this month. The move followed a recommendation from health ministry experts on Wednesday that Moderna’s mRNA shot could be used as a third booster shot for those aged 18 or older. It is the same standard that was applied to the shot developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech, which has so far been given out about 71,000 times as a booster, or just 0.1% of the population. Pedestrians wearing protective masks seen in Tokyo, Japan, as the country approves the Moderna vaccine for booster shots. Photograph: Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters After a relatively late start, Japan has fully inoculated almost 80% of its population, the highest among Group of Seven economies. The country has about 31 million doses left between the Pfizer and Moderna shots, with deals in place to get 170 million more in 2022. New coronavirus infections in Japan have slowed dramatically since a fifth wave that peaked in August. Experts say the fact that Japan started its vaccine push later may be helping keep Covid-19 cases low, as immunity from the shots for most people has not yet waned. Health minister Shigeyuki Goto said last week that boosters should be given as soon as possible. Updated at 4.28am GMT 4.02am GMT Malaysia is now requiring all travellers arriving from the United Kingdom to undertake Covid tests everyday during quarantine. “Due to the Covid-19 Omicron variant spread in the community, travellers arriving from the United Kingdom must now self-test everyday during quarantine. All self-test results (positive, negative or invalid) must be reported,” the ministry of health said in a statement on Thursday. The country also confirmed a second case of the Omicron variant while another 18 suspected cases are currently awaiting genome sequencing for confirmation. Updated at 4.04am GMT 3.57am GMT Indonesia has just identified its first case of the Omicron coronavirus variant, health minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said on Thursday. The case was detected on Wednesday evening and is believed to be an employee at the Wisma Atlet hospital in Jakarta who had no history of overseas travel. There is so far believed to be no community transmission, but another five Omicron cases are suspected, including two Indonesians who had recently returned from the United States and from Britain, and three Chinese nationals currently in quarantine in Manado, North Sulawesi. The government is waiting for genomic sequencing for confirmation. Updated at 4.59am GMT 3.45am GMT Some disappointing news just in for cricket fans. Australia’s captain, Pat Cummins, has been ruled out for the second Ashes Test after being identified as a close contact of a positive Covid-19 case. Just hours before Thursday afternoon’s toss in Adelaide, it emerged that Cummins was dining at a restaurant in the city on Wednesday night when a person at the next table was identified as a positive case. Australian cricket team captain Pat Cummins seen at a training session at Adelaide Oval before being deemed a close contact of a positive Covid-19 case. Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images Cummins left the venue immediately and promptly informed cricket authorities, but the exposure was deemed sufficient for the fast bowler to be forced into isolation for seven days, under South Australia Health protocols. Gutted to miss this Test but really excited to see Neser finally get his chance in the baggy green. He has done the hard yards and is a seriously skilful player. Super frustrating but COVID has thrown us all some curve balls over the last couple of years. Will be cheering along! — Pat Cummins (@patcummins30) December 16, 2021 Our reporter Mike Hytner has the full story here. Related: Australia captain Pat Cummins out of second Ashes Test after contact with Covid case Updated at 3.47am GMT 3.36am GMT New Zealand detects first Omicron case New Zealand has detected its first case of the Omicron Covid-19 variant in a Christchurch managed isolation facility. On Thursday afternoon, the director general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said: This is a person who is in managed isolation in Christchurch. The person arrived in New Zealand on a flight from Germany via Dubai that landed in Auckland...the people on that flight were transferred to Christchurch on a chartered domestic flight trip with all our usual protocols. We fully expected we will find a case of Omicron and in fact, we are treating every border related case as if it were Omicron until proven otherwise. We have good protocols in place that are designed to stop the virus getting across the border.” Everyone who travelled on the same international and charter flights as the case are being treated as close contacts, as are those staying on the same floor of the MIQ facility. Bloomfield said health authorities are considering advice over reducing the interval period between second and third doses of the Pfizer vaccine, to help combat Omicron’s spread and effect. 3.05am GMT Stock markets in Asia have swatted aside any negativity around the escalating Covid situation in advanced economies and followed the US indices into positive territory in Thursday’s session. The Nikkei in Tokyo is up 1.6%, Shanghai is up 0.4%, and even Seoul is up the same amount despite South Korea imposing new dining curfews. The only main straggler is the ASX200 in Sydney where the market has been dragged down 1.6% by a selloff in one of its biggest companies, the biotech firm CSL. All this despite the US Federal Reserve announcing a much quicker normalisation of monetary policy on Wednesday, pencilling in three rate hikes for next year. That could raise the pressure on central banks such as the reserve Bank of Australia to start raising rates earlier, even if Omicron is seen as an obstacle to recovery in the coming months.

The government has so far mandated vaccinations for teachers, workers in the health and disability sectors, police and other public service sectors. Protesters, mostly unmasked, marched through the central business district of Wellington and gathered in front of the parliament building, know as the Beehive. Some at the peaceful demonstration held placards with messages like “Freedom over fear”, “lockdowns destroy lives” and “Kiwis are not lab rats”, Reuters reports. Others had signs with the “Make America Great Again” slogan of former US President Donald Trump. Under mounting pressure, prime minister Jacinda Ardern eased most restrictions ahead of the Christmas break, abandoning her long-standing strategy of eliminating the coronavirus for a new “traffic light” system of living with the virus through higher vaccinations. However, the island nation’s international borders remain shut to the outside world and will only be gradually opened from next year.

Photograph: Praveen Menon/Reuters Updated at 2.49am GMT 2.38am GMT The Dutch family family has apologised after it last week invited a reported 21 people to celebrate the 18th birthday of Princess Amalia, the future queen, in breach of coronavirus health guidance. At present, people in the Netherlands can receive a maximum of four guests over the age of 13 in their homes. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte wrote in a letter to parliament on Wednesday: “The family strived to treat the coronavirus rules responsibly with this outdoor gathering and by taking precautions” including tests and social distancing. “The king informed me that on reflection it was not a good idea to organise [the gathering].” Read the full story here. Related: Dutch royals sorry for Princess Amalia birthday party that broke Covid rules 2.21am GMT Apple said to delay return to office indefinitely Apple Inc is delaying its return to office plans indefinitely, Bloomberg News reports, while the company said it has temporarily closed three stores in the US and Canada after a rise in Covid cases and exposures among the stores’ employees. The company’s employees were previously set to return to offices on 1 February, according to the report, citing a memo sent by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. Google told its employees they would lose pay and eventually be fired if they did not follow the company’s vaccination rules, according to a report, while JP Morgan Chase & Co has asked its unvaccinated staff in Manhattan to work from home. Apple’s store closures in Miami, Annapolis and Ottawa come a day after the company reinstated its policy requiring all customers at its stores in the US to wear masks. All the employees at the three stores will be tested before the stores are reopened, the company said. 2.03am GMT People in England have been told to cut down on socialising in the lead-up to Christmas. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, urged people not to “mix with people you don’t have to”, amid mounting concern over the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. He advised the public to “prioritise social interactions that really matter to them”, suggesting work parties may be ill-advised. Whitty’s comments were in stark contrast to messaging from Boris Johnson, who has previously said he does not want people to cancel Christmas parties. Watch the briefing in the video below. 1.52am GMT Fewer than one in three patients who have ongoing Covid symptoms after being hospitalised with the disease say they feel fully recovered a year later, according to a study that offers new insights into potential treatments. As the pandemic has unfolded, a growing body of research has revealed that Covid not only causes health problems in the short-term, but also has long-term effects. Now a study has revealed many of those who had ongoing symptoms after hospitalisation are showing little improvement, with their condition similar at about 12 months after discharge to seven months earlier. “Only one in three participants felt fully recovered at one year,” said Dr Rachel Evans, one of the co-leads of the post-hospitalisation Covid-19 study – or Phos-Covid – which is led by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Leicester Biomedical Research Centre, although the team says missing data means the figure could be as low as two in 10 or as high as six in 10. Read the full story from our reporter Nicola Davis here. Related: Many Covid hospital patients do not feel fully recovered year later – study 1.36am GMT New Zealand’s health regulator Medsafe has granted provisional approval for the Pfizer Inc Covid-19 vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 years old, the health ministry said in a statement. The provisional approval is for two doses of the paediatric Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, given at least 21 days apart, it said. If approved by the cabinet, the introduction of the paediatric Pfizer vaccine is expected to start in New Zealand no later than the end of January 2022, the ministry said. 1.30am GMT South Korea to reimpose dining curfews South Korea will reinstate social distancing rules and a 9pm curfew for restaurants and cafes to combat spiralling numbers of new infections and hospitalisations. Curbs will return from 18 December to 2 January, limiting social gatherings to no more than four people - as long as they are vaccinated. Restaurants, cafes and nightly entertainment facilities will also need to close by 9pm and movie theatres and internet cafes by 10pm, prime minister Kim Boo-kyum announced on Thursday. Unvaccinated people will only be able to dine out alone, or use takeout or delivery services. The measures came a day after South Korea reported another new daily record in Covid cases. More than 94% of South Korean adults are fully vaccinated, but the number of new cases has surged nearly five-fold and the number of serious cases tripled since the rules were eased last month, adding to strains on the country’s medical system. Cafes, restaurants and karaoke rooms seen on a street in Seoul, South Korea, will now need to close by 9pm, according to new government curfews. Photograph: YONHAP/EPA Updated at 1.33am GMT 1.13am GMT Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you on the blog as we go through all the latest coronavirus developments. Let’s start with the news that South Korea will clamp down on social gatherings, reducing the maximum private gathering size to four people, and cut the hours of some businesses to fight a record-breaking surge of Covid infections that has led to a spike in hospitalisations and deaths. Curfews of 9pm on restaurant and cafe business hours will also be restored, prime minister Kim Boo-kyum said on Thursday. The new measures are set to be in effect from 18 December until 2 January, Yonhap News reports. South Africa has reported its highest daily tally of new coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic with 26,976 infections and 54 deaths recorded on Wednesday. The previous record of 26,485 on 3 July came at the height of the country’s third wave caused by the Delta variant. On that day, 108 Covid deaths were reported. Here is a snapshot of the latest key developments: Covid cases in the UK reached record levels, with 78,610 new cases reported on Wednesday, as the Omicron variant continues its rapid spread. England’s chief medical officer warned people not to mix with others unless they have to in the run-up to Christmas after Britain recorded its most daily cases since the start of the pandemic. French President Emmanuel Macron said it was possible the Covid-19 vaccine would eventually be made compulsory in France, but said it was not the priority for now. A US appeals court revived the Biden administration’s vaccine mandate for healthcare workers in 26 states. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken cut short his trip to Southeast Asia due to a Covid-19 case among his travelling party. Moderna will start a trial of its Covid-19 vaccine across eight African countries to determine its efficacy in people who are HIV positive, Bloomberg News reported. Early data suggests Omicron is more transmissible than Delta, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Canadians advised against all non-essential international travel. The Omicron variant has been found to multiply about 70 times quicker than the original and Delta versions of coronavirus in tissue samples taken from the bronchus, the main tubes from the windpipe to the lungs, a study found. Covid cases in the UK reached record levels, with 78,610 new cases reported on Wednesday, as the Omicron variant continues its rapid spread. Ukraine will extend Covid restrictions for another three months, to 31 March from the end of December, because of low levels of vaccination, the prime minister Denys Shmyhal said. Italy tightens restrictions for arrivals from the rest of the EU, requiring Covid tests of everyone and a five-day quarantine for those who are not vaccinated. The Crown Princess of Denmark tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday.","Id":"world/live/2021/dec/16/covid-news-live-south-korea-reimpose-dining-curfews-south-africa-daily-cases-record-omicron","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Covid live: Italy reports highest daily cases since March; Canada’s Omicron cases ‘could overwhelm Ontario ICUs’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/dec/16/covid-news-live-south-korea-reimpose-dining-curfews-south-africa-daily-cases-record-omicron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2021/dec/16/covid-news-live-south-korea-reimpose-dining-curfews-south-africa-daily-cases-record-omicron","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":11992,"webPublicationDate":"2021-12-17T00:28:13Z","id":"world/live/2021/dec/16/covid-news-live-south-korea-reimpose-dining-curfews-south-africa-daily-cases-record-omicron","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Dough to go: Rome’s first pizza vending machine gets mixed reviews","body":"Massimo Bucolo bravely dared to go where nobody else had gone before in order to take a slice of Italy’s competitive pizza market: a 24-hour vending machine that dishes out freshly baked pizza in three minutes.

Photograph: Rachel Roddy/The Guardian “When I first saw the machine and learned about how it works, I totally fell in love with it,” said Bucolo, an entrepreneur. “And so I did a lot of research and spoke to a lot of food suppliers, ensuring that the ingredients would be of the highest quality. People are mocking the product without even having tried it.” According to Bucolo , there are three other pizza vending machines in Italy – one in Calabria, one in Sardinia and one in Marche – but they are in closed spaces, such as shopping centres, and so Mr Go Pizza is the first that operates around the clock. “I wanted to fill a gap in the market – so many people have called me, especially those who work nightshifts, asking if it’s open as for them this is a real solution if they’re hungry when everything else is closed,” he said. At the Mr Go Pizza machine on Via Catania on Friday, there were plenty of suspicious glances from passersby. Claudio Zampiga waits for his order at Mr Go Pizza. Photograph: Yara Nardi/Reuters “I would never eat pizza from a machine,” said Ludovica. “It’s horrible.” Francesca Giuliani, 25, said: “Maybe it does taste good, but I don’t really fancy it. I prefer to go to a pizzeria.” Alexandra, another curious observer, said: “It’s a bit sad to see pizza coming out of a machine”. Others in the neighbourhood gave more favourable reviews. “It is very useful if you’re hungry late at night and there are no other options,” said Giorgio Girgis, who manages a nearby flower stand that is open 24/7. Luigi Sadano, a young businessman, was visiting Mr Go Pizza as he is intrigued by the concept and keen to replicate the idea in other areas of Rome. “The vending machines market is evolving strongly,” he said. “If people want to eat a pizza at 4am, then they can: it’s a friend of the market, not an enemy.” Bucolo insists he is not taking work away from pizza-makers and neither is he trying to replicate the traditional Italian pizza. “The big mistake is thinking that this is an attack against pizza-makers or that it will send them into crisis,” he said. “In fact, Mr Go’s final product is not the same as the pizza they make … it is a cross between a pizza and a piadina [a thin Italian flatbread]”. Angelo Iezzi, the president of the Italian pizza association, said he was perplexed by the arrival of Mr Go. “Innovation and technology go hand in hand, but so must quality,” he said. Sebastiano Di Troia, who owns a pizza al taglio shop nearby, is taking the new rival in his stride. He honed his pizza-making skills at a pizza school in Rome and says his is “true Roman pizza”. The dough he uses is fermented for 72 hours, a process used in traditional pizza-making that gives the product its flavour and crunch. “The difference is in the taste – you go and try one from the machine, and then come back here and try a real one,” said Di Troia. There was an attempt to do just that, but by the time the Guardian returned to the Mr Go Pizza booth, the machine was not functioning properly – a hazard of the vending machine sector. “It was having problems processing the ingredients and so we preferred to shut it down and fix it,” said Bucolo. “But we are maintaining the machine, cleaning it and ensuring the ingredients are fresh every day.”","Id":"food/2021/may/07/dough-to-go-romes-first-pizza-vending-machine-gets-mixed-reviews","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webTitle":"Dough to go: Rome’s first pizza vending machine gets mixed reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/may/07/dough-to-go-romes-first-pizza-vending-machine-gets-mixed-reviews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2021/may/07/dough-to-go-romes-first-pizza-vending-machine-gets-mixed-reviews","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":715,"webPublicationDate":"2021-05-07T15:05:26Z","id":"food/2021/may/07/dough-to-go-romes-first-pizza-vending-machine-gets-mixed-reviews","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Italy likely to toughen Covid rules with curbs on unvaccinated people","body":"The Italian government is expected to impose restrictions on unvaccinated people as it scrambles to stem a resurgence in Covid-19 infections. In a similar move to that seen in France, those not fully vaccinated could be barred from being served indoors at restaurants and bars and from entering stadiums, museums, theatres, cinemas, swimming pools and gyms. The government hopes the obligation to also present a “green pass” when travelling within the country by train or plane will incentivise more people to get vaccinated. The decree is expected to be approved this week and could take effect from 26 July. Covid-related deaths and hospitalisations have fallen significantly since Italy accelerated its vaccination programme. But infections, mostly driven by the Delta variant, have jumped over the past week, with 3,127 new cases reported on Sunday. Three Covid deaths were recorded on Sunday, bringing the total to 127,867 – the second-highest toll in Europe after the UK. There are 156 coronavirus patients in intensive care across Italy. Covid cases in Italy – graph As of Monday, 50% of people over the age of 12 had been fully vaccinated. However, there has been a slowdown in bookings in recent weeks as young people delay receiving the first dose in order not to disrupt their summer holidays. Opposition to the green pass scheme from far-right parties is also emboldening Italy’s small but virulent anti-vaccine movement as well as dissuading people who are undecided about the vaccine. Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League, a key partner in prime minister Mario Draghi’s broad coalition government, backed introducing a green pass to enter stadiums “but not if you go for a pizza”. During a dinner at the home of the Algerian ambassador in Rome last week, Salvini said he had missed his first dose in June because he was “on trial” but would have it in August. However, he said he would not force his 18-year-old son to have one. In an interview with La Repubblica on Sunday, Salvini said: “I refuse to see someone chasing him with a swab test or syringe. We have to make sure parents and grandparents are safe without punishing our children and grandchildren.” Giorgia Meloni, who leads the far-right opposition party Brothers of Italy, said the green pass would be a further blow to the economy. Francesco Lollobrigida, a Brothers of Italy deputy, urged the under-40s to refrain from taking the vaccine and described the green pass as “blackmail from the government and a violation of liberty”. While the move by the French government to ban unvaccinated people from accessing public venues, including bars and restaurants, led to record vaccination bookings, thousands protested against the measure on Sunday. Together, the League and Brothers of Italy have more than 40% support in opinion polls. “Their views on the vaccine have a big influence on people,” said Sara, whose mother, in her 60s and living in Sicily, is refusing to have the vaccine. “I never expected this as my mum has always been someone who worried about health. She often sends me misinformation found on social media. It’s a battle to encourage her to have the vaccine but there’s a lot of support for Salvini where she lives – I’m sure if he changed his stance there’d be a surge in vaccine bookings.”","Id":"world/2021/jul/19/italy-likely-toughen-covid-rules-curbs-unvaccinated-people","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Italy likely to toughen Covid rules with curbs on unvaccinated people","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/19/italy-likely-toughen-covid-rules-curbs-unvaccinated-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/jul/19/italy-likely-toughen-covid-rules-curbs-unvaccinated-people","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":546,"webPublicationDate":"2021-07-19T13:23:38Z","id":"world/2021/jul/19/italy-likely-toughen-covid-rules-curbs-unvaccinated-people","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for pizzette fritte – fried mini pizzas","body":"One of the most satisfying sights in the kitchen is watching a circle of yeasted dough in very hot oil. First it shimmies, in the same way you might make your way across the function room to the dance floor at a wedding – not quite dancing and all in the shoulders – in a coat of bubbles. Then comes the blistering – small bubbles erupting on its surface, before the big puff – although this usually happens on just one side, which might save you the trouble of turning it over as the pizzetta capsizes, all the time getting more and more golden. I am convinced this is even more exciting if you yourself are impossibly hot. And, of course, there is the smell! Frying dough – like grating lemons, opening a new bottle of olive oil, packet of coffee or cheese snacks, chopping herbs, or grinding spices, – is one of the great smells. It is a rather exhausted quote now, the one from Laurie Colwin about how one is never cooking alone, rather doing so with those who taught you, be that a person, book or TV cookery show. Exhausted because it is true, whether it is your beloved grandmother, Nigel or Nigella, or a bouncing young chef on TikTok. I have four people with me when I make these. The first is Daniela Del Balzo, a Neapolitan cookery teacher in Rome, whose stories about eating these as a child are everything you would hope for and expect from a story about eating fried pizza cooked by a grandmother in Naples in the 1950s. The second is Rita Pane, whose book I Sapori Del Sud (or Tastes of Southern Italy) seems to be the one I refer to most these days. The third is a Polish friend who taught me to add a boiled mashed potato to doughnuts and dough, which sounds as if it might make them heavy, but is, in fact, the complete opposite, rendering them plump and cushiony. The fourth is Sophia Loren, playing the pizza seller, Sophia, in L’Oro Di Napoli, the film suggestion for this week’s column. Pizzette fritte (little fried pizzas), also known as pizzelle fritte, are not to be confused with pizze fritte, which are filled (often with ricotta, provola and dried curls of pork called ciccioli), folded in half, sealed and fried. Pizzette fritte, on the other hand, are small rounds of dough fried unfolded and without filling or topping. Once golden and puffed up, they are lifted out of the oil, blotted dry and topped with a spoonful of tomato sauce, maybe some grated pecorino or parmesan, and certainly a basil leaf. When they are topped with tomato sauce, a dusting of cheese and basil, pizzette are called montanare. And the most important thing is to eat them immediately, or as soon as you can, with a cold beer, and ideally standing around the cooker. Pizzette fritte/montanare – little fried pizzas with tomato, cheese and basil Serves 4-6 For the pizzette 10g dried yeast 140ml lukewarm milk 140ml lukewarm water 500g plain flour (type 00, ideally) 1 potato (about 150g), boiled, peeled and mashed Salt Sunflower oil, for frying For the sauce 500g tomatoes Olive oil 1 garlic clove, peeled Oregano To serve Grated parmesan or pecorino Basil leaves To make the dough, mix the yeast with the milk, water and a spoonful of flour, then leave to sit for 10 minutes. Mix in the rest of the flour, the potato and a good pinch of salt, then bring together into a ball. Wash the bowl, dry and rub with oil, then return the dough to the bowl, cover and leave to rest in a draught-free place for an hour. Meanwhile, get on with the sauce. Peel the tomatoes by plunging them into boiling water for a minute, then into cold, at which point the skins will slip away easily. Roughly chop the flesh. In a large frying pan, warm a good amount of olive oil and the garlic clove (peeled and squashed for a gentle flavour, sliced for stronger, minced for strongest) and leave to sizzle gently. Add the tomatoes, a pinch of salt and oregano, and leave to simmer gently, until rich and dense. Pull plum-sized pieces of dough from the ball and flatten them into palm-sized circles. Lay these on a lightly floured surface while you heat a litre of sunflower oil to 180C (or until a cube of bread turns golden in one minute). Fry the pizzette in small batches, for only a minute or so on each side, until they puff up and turn golden. Lift out with a slotted spoon and blot quickly on kitchen towel. Top each pizzette with a blob of tomato sauce, some grated parmesan or pecorino and a basil leaf, and eat immediately.","Id":"food/2021/aug/30/rachel-roddy-recipe-pizzette-fritte-fried-mini-pizzas","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webTitle":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for pizzette fritte | A kitchen in Rome","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/aug/30/rachel-roddy-recipe-pizzette-fritte-fried-mini-pizzas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2021/aug/30/rachel-roddy-recipe-pizzette-fritte-fried-mini-pizzas","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":802,"webPublicationDate":"2021-08-30T10:00:32Z","id":"food/2021/aug/30/rachel-roddy-recipe-pizzette-fritte-fried-mini-pizzas","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Hot summer nights: ‘I was alone on holiday, and this was my last night on the island …’","body":"It was high summer on the Italian island of Procida, too hot but somehow still green, and I was eating dinner at a beachside cafe that spilled on to the black sand of the west-facing Spiaggia di Ciraccio. I wasn’t supposed to be here. Ten days earlier, a long-building romance with a screenwriter from Milan had ended abruptly. It had begun when our knees touched in his car. Long emails full of agony and promise followed, made all the less real for jumping between English and Italian, but then stopped. A short trip to Naples to try things in a new context was cancelled. I was desperately sad, but had already booked my flight to Italy and, as it happened, a friend was staying on the island nearby. So, I tagged along. We were staying on the top floor of a pink two-storey villa with white balconies; it looked like a cake. I slept in a bunk bed at the back and, each morning, woken by goats in our courtyard, we had black coffee and quartered peaches. I started to feel OK. Then, three days in, my friend, too, decided to leave. She had met a man, this time from Rome. He had a motorbike. She showed me a photo on her phone. That evening, she caught the ferry to the mainland and two men moved into the flat below mine. I wasn’t surprised she had left; I was terrible company and the trip had already been a catalogue of errors. I had left my makeup bag in a cab. In Naples, I paid €22 for a meal because the restaurant charged by weight. On Procida, we spent every evening on a red-tiled rooftop cornered with yellow broom flowers, talking to kind people who didn’t want to hear the screenwriter story more than twice. We all drank hard and fast above the din of scooters, but I couldn’t get drunk. I felt too alone. After my friend left, I spent my remaining two days swimming around the two grey sea stacks that split the beach, eating pizza and rabbit, and removing the black sand that filled my shoes. Then I ran out of data on my phone. There is nothing wrong with being abroad, alone. For a long stretch, whenever I felt a bit lost, I would go to Italy by myself. I spoke the language and knew the landscape, so it felt like home, even on my own. The trips in my 20s had been more successful: train-hopping along the Italian Riviera’s Cinque Terre; Naples (twice), Venice, Rome and Florence. Then I turned 30 and went to Milan, which landed me here. But it was my last night, so I wanted to make the most of it. I returned to my beachside cafe, took the same table at the back and ordered rabbit, two beers and a limoncello. Afterwards, I rolled two cigarettes for something to do. It was quite late, but the idea of going back to the villa alone depressed me. Another drink. A swim, perhaps. Just then, a hand appeared at my table, holding a lighter in the colours of the tricolore. I turned around to see one of the men from the flat below. He was about my age, slim and tanned, with either green or blue eyes – I couldn’t tell. He hovered for a moment then sat down. He told me he was from Rome and where he was staying. I pretended I didn’t know. I was surprised this was unfolding. I still hadn’t replaced my lost makeup and had a patch of sunburn like a birthmark on my collarbone. Still, I was buzzy from the limoncello, so I let it happen. We talked for about 10 minutes, mostly in Italian, and then he suggested we go back to the villa for a drink. He pointed towards a scooter parked outside. I agreed, because that is what you are meant to do, isn’t it? On the back of the scooter, my heart was pounding violently. When we got to the gates of the villa, I climbed off and stepped back. I had changed my mind; I wanted to be alone. I told him I needed to walk, making a gesture with my finger about feeling dizzy, but that I would drop in later. His face fell, although not so much that it looked crass. Relieved at how easy it was, I walked up the road in the dark. There was a walk I had read about online, which takes you east, over the crest of the island, through alleys without pavements, past orange trees and bougainvillea. Just before the Santa Margherita church, you can look down at the pastel-coloured Marina Corricella, shaped like a smile and, at night, lit up so well that it looks like a screensaver. I had my second cigarette here and began walking back. It was about midnight, the night mild and starry. Outside the villa, I saw his lights were still on. I crept through the courtyard, past the goats and went upstairs – alone, but fine with that. The next morning, I slipped out, and walked to the port to wait for my ferry back to Naples.","Id":"lifeandstyle/2021/aug/18/nothing-wrong-being-alone-holiday-last-night-island","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webTitle":"Hot summer nights: ‘I was alone on holiday, and this was my last night on the island …’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/aug/18/nothing-wrong-being-alone-holiday-last-night-island","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2021/aug/18/nothing-wrong-being-alone-holiday-last-night-island","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":870,"webPublicationDate":"2021-08-18T14:30:12Z","id":"lifeandstyle/2021/aug/18/nothing-wrong-being-alone-holiday-last-night-island","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Monica Vitti obituary","body":"Although she was often described, perhaps with a touch of irony, as the “muse of incommunicability” for her dramatic roles in several of Michelangelo Antonioni’s films, Monica Vitti, who has died aged 90, always aspired to be a comic actor. In 1962, she had an offer to do a film for Agnès Varda, but turned it down; as she explained in an interview, “I want to remain loyal to Michelangelo, who has promised to make me the Carole Lombard of the second half of the century.” Though Vitti certainly had comparable looks and verve, and did eventually succeed in becoming a popular comedic star, she will probably remain in most film buffs’ minds as Giuliana, the complicated young blond woman in Antonioni’s Il Deserto Rosso (Red Desert, 1964), his first colour feature. Giuliana was perhaps Vitti’s most credible and identifiable characterisation. Her main concern is for her child’s neurosis, but she is not helped by her anguished attempt at a romantic relationship with an engineer, played by Richard Harris. The film contains one of world cinema’s most bizarre lines: “My hair hurts”, but it probably aroused merriment only when seen translated in a subtitle – Tonino Guerra, the film’s co-writer, pointed out that in Italian it sounds better. Vitti and Antonioni had begun living together as he prepared to work on the film in which she shot to fame, L’Avventura (1960), but he did not tell her much about the part she was to play, either before or during its prolonged and hazardous shoot. She later said: “What I’d learned in drama school wasn’t much use on the rocks of [the Sicilian island] Lisca Bianca, where we were shooting under such dramatic conditions. Michelangelo treats his actors as objects, and it is useless to ask him the meaning of a scene or a line of dialogue.” Vitti in Joseph Losey’s Modesty Blaise, 1966. Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock Like most of the cast and crew, she had faith in him and the film, in which she played Claudia, the best friend of a young woman who goes missing on a deserted volcanic island. While searching for her, Claudia becomes involved with the missing woman’s boyfriend. All their hopes were pinned on Cannes, where the film was in competition. It was Vitti’s first festival experience, and the hostile reception from some of the audience at the official screening was a shock, leaving her in tears. She soon found consolation in the film’s jury prize, awarded after a campaign led by the film-maker Roberto Rossellini, which opened the way to her stardom in Italy and internationally. L’Avventura was the first in a trilogy said by Antonioni to be about alienation in the modern world, of which the second, La Notte (The Night, 1961), was arguably the best. The female lead was Jeanne Moreau, playing the wife of a disillusioned novelist (Marcello Mastroianni). Vitti, on this occasion a brunette, had the significant role of Valentina, a carefree society girl, for which she won a best supporting actress award from the Italian film critics. In the final film of the trilogy, L’Eclisse (The Eclipse, 1962), Vitti was paired with Alain Delon and gave another convincing performance in a complex role. The film was also jeered at Cannes, but it too won the special prize in spite of François Truffaut’s opposition. In 1964, Vitti returned to the stage, chosen by Franco Zeffirelli to play the Marilyn Monroe character in Arthur Miller’s After the Fall. I was in Naples when Miller came to see the production there and praised Vitti’s performance. After Red Desert, she had a lead role in Modesty Blaise (1966), directed by Joseph Losey and based on Peter O’Donnell’s comic strip. Her relationship with Antonioni ended in 1967; the following year she won the hearts of audiences – in Italy, at least – in Mario Monicelli’s La Ragazza con la Pistola (The Girl With a Pistol), playing a Sicilian woman who goes to London to seek revenge against the fiance who has abandoned her. In a scene from The Girl with the Pistol (La Ragazza con la Pistola), 1968. Photograph: Sipa US/Alamy In Ettore Scola’s send-up of Italian stereotypes, Dramma della Gelosia (The Pizza Triangle, 1970), she held her own against Mastroianni and Giancarlo Giannini; she was becoming the only woman to be bracketed (also in salary terms) with the popular Italian male comic actors of the 70s, appearing in one commercial film after another. She often partnered Alberto Sordi, matching his over-the-top performances. One of their best, with him directing, was a sub-Fellini subject, Polvere di Stelle (Stardust, 1973), in which they played two delusional music-hall comics. By then, she was in a relationship with the Red Desert cinematographer, Carlo Di Palma. He directed her in three films, including Teresa la Ladra (Teresa the Thief, 1973), a comic saga of a waif who survives the second world war thanks to petty crime. In 1974, she appeared in Luis Buñuel’s The Phantom of Liberty. Born Maria Luisa to Adele (nee Vittilia) and Angelo Ceciarelli, she later said that her childhood was unhappy, and, when her family emigrated to the US when she was 18, she stayed in Rome and enrolled at the Academy of Dramatic Art there. Her stage name came from her mother’s maiden name. In the summer of her graduation in 1953 came her first theatrical engagement, in the chorus of a Greek tragedy. The first film in which she appeared was Ridere! Ridere! Ridere! (Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!, 1954). She had several small roles in films and plays before meeting Antonioni in a post-synchronisation studio in Rome, where she dubbed the actor Dorian Gray’s part in Il Grido (The Cry, 1957). Antonioni was also directing a theatre company, and he cast her as Sally Bowles in John van Druten’s play I Am a Camera, for which she received good reviews, before embarking on his trilogy. Throughout her film career and relationship with Di Palma, Antonioni and Vitti had remained close friends, and in 1980 he directed her for the last time in a TV film of Jean Cocteau’s play The Eagle Has Two Heads, which he called Il Mistero di Oberwald. With her husband Roberto Russo in Rome, 1993. Photograph: Camilla Morandi/AGF/Rex/Shutterstock Vitti had begun a relationship with the photographer Roberto Russo in 1975, and he directed her in the low-key comedies Flirt (1983) and Francesca è Mia (Francesca’s Mine, 1986), as well as a TV programme in which she compered a debate with film and drama students. She and Russo married in 1995. In 1990, Vitti directed herself in Scandalo Segreto (Secret Scandal), co-starring Elliott Gould, about a woman who, while keeping a video diary, discovers her husband’s affair. Disappointed when the film was tepidly received, she found a new creative outlet, publishing A Bed Is Like a Rose, a delightful semi-autobiographical book in which she said that nothing could be further from her own personality than the kind of alienation with which she had so often been associated. In 1995 Vitti was awarded a career Golden Lion award at the Venice film festival. She withdrew, Garbo-like, from public life during her last years and the Italian media respected her privacy as she reportedly suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. She is survived by Russo. • Monica Vitti (Maria Luisa Ceciarelli), actor, born 3 November 1931; died 2 February 2022 • John Francis Lane died in 2019","Id":"film/2022/feb/02/monica-vitti-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webTitle":"Monica Vitti obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/02/monica-vitti-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/feb/02/monica-vitti-obituary","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts","wordcount":1191,"webPublicationDate":"2022-02-02T18:03:30Z","id":"film/2022/feb/02/monica-vitti-obituary","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Eurovision 2021: Italy win Eurovision as UK scores nul points again – as it happened","body":"12.13am BST 2021 Eurovision Song Contest Måneskin have won the 65th Eurovision Song Contest for Italy.

But oh boy this is tense. 11.37pm BST Germany, Netherlands and Spain have also scored nothing from the public as well as the UK, there is going to be some soul-searching about what the “Big Five” do now. 11.36pm BST Well this is awkward Europe's message to the UK \uD83D\uDE02#Eurovision pic.twitter.com/nb44KY0pWn — Jono (@jonoread) May 22, 2021 11.35pm BST United Kingdom score nul points in the Eurovision Song Contest Oh. 11.32pm BST The last time there was a nul points in the final was in 2015 when both Austria and Germany scored it. 11.31pm BST So as we get to the end of the juries, Switzerland lead with 267, and the UK have zero. 11.30pm BST Here we are… Captured (by the mic guy) #Eurovision #OpenUp pic.twitter.com/Szi4QEMDiC — Eurovision Song Contest (@Eurovision) May 22, 2021 11.28pm BST Have we just had a reverse wardrobe malfunction? What went on then? The fleet’s lit up. She’s more drunk than I am. 11.28pm BST I was moaning about him playing the new single but it is an awful shame that Duncan Lawrence could only appear on the screen tonight, after waiting two years since winning it. Duncan Laurence on the screen. Photograph: Sander Koning/EPA 11.26pm BST Note to self: must check with the editor how impartial you have to be on this blog about the Eurovision song contest that Ukraine deserves to win. 11.25pm BST 12 POINTS TO UKRAINE FINALLY SOMEONE SEES SENSE 11.25pm BST I don’t think you can call this - a fifty point spread in the top five could easily be totally shaken up by the public vote. 11.23pm BST Here’s Germany’s Jendrik seeing it is still Germany 3-0 UK at the foot of the scoreboard. Jendrik. Photograph: Rolf Klatt/REX/Shutterstock 11.21pm BST 10 hours of Jaja Ding Dong Jaja Dingdong 11.20pm BST “Incredible show” – that will do. DRINK!!! 11.18pm BST France holds narrow early lead in jury votes After 24 juries: France - 164 Switzerland - 160 Malta - 138 11.17pm BST I don’t believe France will win, because they just interviewed her. It’s like how they never focus on the person who will eventually win in the opening episodes of X-Factor / The Apprentice / The Great British Sewing Bee Of Pottery Can You Ice That Bun? or whatever it is called. 11.16pm BST I feel like the equivalent of one of those blokes in the stands bellowing “Why don’t you just score some goals” at your football team, but you do think if like the UK you are going to get nul points but are in the “Big Five”, you might as well go down the Germany route and just send whatever you want. I mean, we couldn’t do worse with a The Fall tribute band than a massive polystyrene hand giving the continent the finger, right? Germany at Eurovision.

DOUBLE DRINK!!! 11.10pm BST It’s a nul points to \uD83C\uDDEC\uD83C\uDDE7from \uD83C\uDDEE\uD83C\uDDEA 11.09pm BST According to my conspiracy theory, Switzerland is the country that gets about five or six douze points and then drops like a stone. 11.08pm BST The 10 year old from Greece can take as long as he wants to give the points to Cyprus. 11.07pm BST Switzerland, France have a massive gap at the top so far above Malta and Iceland. But remember, these are just the jury points. It is the phoney Eurovision war. 11.06pm BST Amanda Holden stop it with your language skills. Oh no. Please stop. 11.03pm BST SINGING IS NOT IN THIS JOB DESCRIPTION, I DO NOT CARE IF YOU WON THE COMPETITION. READ THE ROOM. 11.02pm BST Switzerland and France have both done well in the first couple of juries. Both very angst-ridden songs. Switzerland have the early jury lead. Photograph: Rolf Klatt/REX/Shutterstock 11.00pm BST I do just need to draw your attention to the fitted glove element of the zebra costume. The Zebra of Poland Photograph: BBC 10.58pm BST Israel is the first jury. I’m not going to do a read out of every jury because I’ve live blogged Donald Trump press conferences that made more sense than this process. Poland has come dressed as a zebra though, and I can’t let that pass. 10.56pm BST He didn’t quite say “wonderful show” but have a DRINK!!! anyway 10.55pm BST Now, again without being a complete cynic about it, if I had possession of the scores from the juries in advance and a spreadsheet, it wouldn’t be beyond my wit to engineer the order of the juries so that there’s a early frontrunner the drops off the pace, another track that surges ahead, a track that doesn’t get any votes until nearly the very last jury, and then two songs that end up very tightly neck-and-neck until right at the end. I’m not saying that the order of the juries is fixed to make that happen, but it definitely makes for better TV. However, the twist that everyone always forgets these days is that basically at that point they then dump all the points from the public vote on top. Each country actually awards twenty-four points – twelve to the favourite from the jury, and twelve to the one that wins the public vote. So there’s actually a whole another 456 points on offer which means that after watching all 39 juries tell us it has been a wonderful show etc, it is still pretty much anybody’s guess as to who out of the top few songs will have enough points from the public to sweep to victory. It’s going to take ages, but we’re going to have fun. 10.52pm BST Have you voted? Someone in the comments VOTING FOR UKRAINE just reminded me to vote. COUNTDOWN TIME! 10.47pm BST None of this “new single” nonsense, mate, that’s like George Michael at the Olympics. We just want the old favourites. 10.47pm BST Lordi hit upon the idea that they’ll always look the same when they come back to Eurovision because they looked putrid to begin with. You don’t even need the original line-up. The songs sounds less impressive than I remember it being. Maybe it was just the shock value of it all. 10.45pm BST I can’t believe that they made Helena Paparizou wear that same silver dress as well. 10.44pm BST By the way, a big shout out to Ewan Spence and Samantha Ross and the rest of the team at the ESC Insight website who provide copious amounts of background coverage of the show which has been simply invaluable in helping me get on the case for this live blog. 10.41pm BST I can’t work out whether this rooftop thing is an amazing way to do the performances with very quick changeovers and totally Covid safe, or an unnecessary complication. Ding-a-dong indeed. 10.39pm BST One thing I noted in the semi-finals was they kept pairing Nikkie de Jager who is 1.9m (6’2”) with Edsilia Rombley. My research skills have failed me and I haven’t been able to find out exactly how tall Edsilia is, but let me assure you that it is very much not 1.9m (6’2”) which becomes quite apparent on screen as the cameras try to frame them both in the same shot like just now. 10.38pm BST Spain in the recap has just reminded that my friend Erica [see 21.18] who was in Rotterdam for the jury show last night was full of praise for the staging of that. She said: “The moon for the Spain song was super cool - they inflated it as they raised it into place and at the end they unzipped it and about 10 of them squeezed all the air out to get it off stage quickly.” It is possible we’d have had more fun watching that than listening to the Spanish song, no? 10.30pm BST Not sure about the carpool karaoke bit here, it feels like a trailer for a much more fun and extensive extra on the DVD release where you get a lot more context and laughs. There’s plenty of DRINK!!!! potential if you’ve been counting the number of former Eurovision winners appearing and every single time they cut to them. Which I confess I have 100% not been doing. So shall we say three-and-a-half DRINKS!!!!! 10.28pm BST Is this you? #Eurovision Me in my head Me in real life pic.twitter.com/A8RaYgM573 — Solitaire Townsend (@GreenSolitaire) May 22, 2021 10.26pm BST While the voting goes on, don’t forget that Scott Bryan came up with his list of 20 wildest Eurovision performances ever… Related: Vampires, naked apes and free booze! The 20 wildest Eurovision performances ever 10.24pm BST I don’t know why she is explaining all this to us, it is the people over-staying their 15 second welcome she needs to speak to. 10.20pm BST Now I’ve got to be honest, the voting bit for me is a bit of the show that needs a freshen up and a rethink. I get that in the 1970s and 1980s the ability to put together a broadcast where you had sound and pictures from various European capitals in turn was all about showing off the technical prowess of the European Broadcasting Union. Well done. But let’s be honest, it is 2021, you can be trekking in Peru or the Himalayas and put a FaceTime call in to your nan. The novelty of actually getting pictures from far-flung Madrid, Paris, Rome and Athens in quick succession on the same show has subsided somewhat. Especially in the show following a global pandemic where there’s a degree of Zoom-fatigue among the chattering work-from-home classes. We’re gonna get a lot more music and voting recaps before that all starts though. 10.17pm BST While this whole bridge/orchestra shebang is going on, I might mention I had another chat with someone with Eurovision connections going way back this week – much further than Andy Abraham [see 20.44]. Jan Pulsford, as well as working with acts in the eighties like Cyndi Lauper and Thompson Twins, was one of the co-writers on the UK’s 1983 entry I’m Never Giving Up by Sweet Dreams. UK at Eurovision 1983 Jan recalls that in an era of what she describes as hair extensions and deep analogue sounds: “We recorded the demo with my beloved Oberheim System and two session vocalists. As often happens when there is a whiff of success, everything changes and so the song got taken over, re-arranged, and re-recorded and a group was formed to perform at the BBC’s Song for Europe competition.” She jokes that despite going to Munich for the event, she doesn’t think she ever actually met the trio of Helen Kray, Bobby McVay and none other than Fame Academy’s Carrie Grant who performed her song. She did meet Terry Wogan though, and says “I still have my Eurovision mug.” Pulsford is still active in the music industry. Through lockdown she’s been broadcasting Radio Mothership which has specialised in ambient music to soothe people during the pandemic, as well as hosting monthly streams on Twitch of an eclectic mix of music, often featuring live sessions. She’s also the driving force behind a series of planned one-day festivals this summer in Suffolk collectively called Spirit of Place. 10.13pm BST I keep thinking that the pods the artists are sitting in look like the galactic senate from Star Wars: Phantom Menace but I can’t find a picture where we won’t have to pay Lucasfilm a zillion galactic credits to use it so I can prove it to you. So just imagine that I have. 10.09pm BST I’m just taking a breather while they do this recap. After this we are going to get – I believe – loads of performances from former winners on the rooftops of Rotterdam, some weird orchestra/DJ mash-up, and also a spectacular dancing countdown. I mean, why not? It’s Eurovision. I’ve honestly loved it, it has been a really strong final this year so far. I just said in the comments, there’s about eight or nine songs that if they won, you’d think, “Yep, sure, it was always on the cards”. 10.04pm BST Ukraine is #19 if you are voting, by the way. Just saying. Ukraine at Eurovision. Photograph: Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty Images 10.03pm BST Ok, I said to myself that I would not do this, but I’m going to put it on the line. I want Ukraine but I can’t see it happening. MY TOP FIVE: San Marino Italy Switzerland Russia Iceland Put your top five predictions in the comments NOW!!! Before voting starts and there is a prize* for the most accurate. [*The only prize truly on offer here is a smug sense of self-satisfaction] 10.02pm BST I’ve got to be honest this just totally kicks up a gear when Flo Rida appears, doesn’t it? And I reckon with such a great position in the show and fresh in viewers’ minds as the start to vote, this could come close. San Marino with Flo Rida. Photograph: Sander Koning/EPA 10.01pm BST They’ve gone a bit over the top with the mask mandate rules here, huh? San Marino at Eurovision. Photograph: Patrick van Emst/ANP/AFP/Getty Images 9.59pm BST 26. San Marino Far be it from me to be cynical, but how incredibly lucky for Eurovision organisers that the draw means the last thing you get in the show is the guest appearance from Flo Rida, eh? It is hotly tipped SAN MARINO now, with Adrenalina being sung by Senhit featuring a guest appearance from the US rapper. It’s a little bit repetitive for my personal taste, but I think it is very likely to be right, right up there. 9.59pm BST I like it better this time round, but there’s stronger songs, aren’t there? Sweden at Eurovision. Photograph: Robin Utrecht/REX/Shutterstock 9.55pm BST 25. Sweden And now SWEDEN. It is Tusse with Voices. I’m quite fond of the backing vocals “One million voices” chorus refrain in this one, but it feels a bit like a triumph of back-story over melody, and it is sandwiched between two real favourites. Toussin “Tusse’’ Chiza came to Sweden as an unaccompanied child refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo aged 13. His voice is decent, but the staging is extremely low-key. Pleased to report – despite Rhodri knocking my confidence about declaring these – that it has a CYNICAL KEY CHANGE™ in it towards the end so you can DRINK!!! 9.54pm BST To be honest I wasn’t getting “a raw cry from the misfits of this fake society”, more like Royal Blood’s new album. 9.51pm BST 24. Italy A lot of people are saying great things about this. ITALY, and Måneskin will perform Zitti e Buoni. They’ve already won something, by the way. The Eurostory website voted this the best lyrics of this year’s competition, beating Russia’s Russian Women by Manizha, and Birth of a New Age by Jeangu Macrooy for the Netherlands. Of Zitti e Buoni, the judges said: “The metaphors in the lyrics are well-chosen and constantly speak to you. This is not a sweet song, and therefore the imagery isn’t pretty, but purposely disruptive. Zitti e Buoni is a raw cry from the misfits of this fake society.” Updated at 9.51pm BST 9.49pm BST Macrooy’s song addresses issues of colonialism and slavery, and he’s been criticised as a result. He isn’t alone among competitors at this year’s Eurovision in having been a target for racial abuse in the run up to the show. If you fancy a bit of background reading at some point – possibly during the seven hour voting process later on – Sharleen Wright has written this article on the issue of social media bullying at Eurovision, looking at the experiences of Germany’s Jendrik, Russia’s Manizha and Sweden’s Tusse, who have all received abuse. 9.48pm BST 23. Netherlands Host nation NETHERLANDS now. Jeangu Macrooy is singing Birth of a New Age. Having had the expense of hosting last year’s special show and this year’s contest, you might be forgiven for thinking that the Netherlands might not fancy winning and going for three in a row. However, this is tipped to do well. I’ve not seen this one because they qualified for the final automatically as hosts, and I was an idiot and I thought it would be “fun” to try and judge and write about the songs instantly. What. A. Big. Chungus. Netherlands Photograph: Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty Images 9.46pm BST Rhodri Marsden, who knows more about music than I could ever forget, is claiming this as the first proper genuine key change. FIRST KEY CHANGE THANK YOU NORWAY #Eurovision — Rhodri Marsden (@rhodri) May 22, 2021 9.45pm BST If it was earlier in the evening I might have managed to work up some erudite Guardian joke about Wim Wenders’ Wings of Desire so you could go “Oooh look at that po-faced guy” but alas no joy, but here’s a picture anyway. Wings of Desire Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/Allstar/ROAD MOVIES FILMPRODUKTI 9.43pm BST Can you get more Eurovision than this? Tix Photograph: Sander Koning/EPA 9.42pm BST 22. Norway And now, unfairly still regarded as kings and queens of the dreaded nul points, which I’ve cruelly just reminded them of, it is NORWAY. Representing them is Tix with Fallen Angel, a title which he has taken somewhat literally in the costume stakes. Left me a bit cold this one but it seemed to land well with the fans in the semi-final. Tix is hugely successful in Norway, and gets his name from reclaiming being bullied over his Tourette syndrome diagnosis and the resultant ‘ticks’. Also comes equipped with a CYNICAL KEY CHANGE™ so DRINK!!! 9.42pm BST I’m possibly easily pleased but I really like that – notwithstanding the weird choice of references to the dead First World War spy with the missing head 9.42pm BST Ewa is not wrong, is she? These are a lot of Ariana Grandes in one place #Azerbaijan #Eurovision — Comedy of Ewas (@EwaSR) May 22, 2021 9.40pm BST She name-drops Cleopatra in this song, and her 2020 entry would have been about Cleopatra had the contest gone ahead… 9.39pm BST Weird trivia corner: after her death the head of Mata Hari, whose birthname was Margaretha Geertruida Zelle, was embalmed and kept in a museum in Paris, but it went missing in the 1950s…*cue spooky mystery music* 9.38pm BST 21. Azerbaijan It takes some nerve to rock up to Rotterdam with a song about a Dutch woman who was executed by the French for collaborating with the Germans during the First World War but it is Eurovision and here we are. Mata Hari by Efendi is representing AZERBAIJAN and it is what I would classify as “a Eurovision banger”. I mostly listen to Joy Division and The Fall in my spare time, mind you, so my views on pop music may not be definitive. However my colleague Ben has also described it as “the propulsively brilliant banger you’re most likely to Shazam after a pitcher of sangria in whichever Mediterranean resort you’ve been allowed on holiday to this summer” which sounds good to me. 9.37pm BST This is very French, isn’t it? France at Eurovision. Photograph: Rolf Klatt/REX/Shutterstock 9.34pm BST 20. France Et Voilà. C’est Barbara Pravi avec Voilà pour la FRANCE. Bon chance!

Ukraine at Eurovision and Keith Harris and Orville Composite: Eurovision/REX/Shutterstock 9.31pm BST This will 100% be getting my vote later in the evening while my editor is shouting at me to get off the phone to Graham Norton and keep live blogging. It also has some kind of whistle/flute type affair – Ludicrous musical instruments! DRINK!!!!! 9.30pm BST 19. Ukraine I mentioned earlier the joy of Eurovision sometimes being someone turning up with a nose-flute, a live sheep and a folk costume, and I think this is the closest we are going to get to that tonight. I absolutely love this. Go_A is singing Shum (Шум) for UKRAINE and they are going for it. It is techno-folk that builds and builds and Kateryna Pavlenko is going to be *checks notes* using the ancient folklore technique of “white voice” throat-singing. Me either. 9.29pm BST Jack Whitehall is on board STOP THE COUNT #Lithuania #Eurovision — Jack Whitehall (@jackwhitehall) May 22, 2021 9.27pm BST On the long shots I can’t help thinking that they’ve “Roop”ed in Jurgen Klopp on the drums and James Corden as the dancer on the left, which is off-putting. Surely the Friends Reunion is enough for Corden, without gatecrashing Eurovision? Lithuania at Eurovision. Photograph: Rolf Klatt/REX/Shutterstock 9.26pm BST 18. Lithuania Next up is LITHUANIA, with Discoteque by The Roop. It’s not the U2 song, no. That’s not how Eurovision works. It’s very, very yellow, this. Very yellow indeed. Look out for the finger dance, I can guarantee you will spend the rest of the evening intermittently looking down at your hands and wondering if you too can do it. On semi-final night singer Vaidotas explained that one gesture is an ‘e’ and the Spock gesture is a ‘v’ so it makes ‘e-v’ for Eurovision. I wasn’t really any the wiser to be honest. 9.25pm BST I wasn’t impressed with this at the semi-final but it has grown on me during this performance. And not just because I feel bad about the joke. She’s young but it is a mature performance, especially holding that little bit of acappella at the end in front of a Eurovision-sized audience. Oooof. 9.24pm BST THE FLOOR IS LAVA! Bulgaria at Eurovision. Photograph: Patrick van Emst/EPA 9.22pm BST Oh no I feel bad because I was rude about this song’s theme then it turns out there’s a heart-breaking story behind it. My turn to DRINK!!! 9.22pm BST 17. Bulgaria Cheerfully titled Growing Up Is Getting Old, this is Victoria next for BULGARIA. I can 100% guarantee that if you had told nine year old me watching Bucks Fizz win Eurovision that I would grow up to be live blogging the contest for a newspaper in 2021, nine year old me would have said “What is a live blog and are there flying cars yet?” 9.20pm BST If you are watching this on the BBC then that Danish guy basically just said “wonderful show” didn’t he? DRINK!!!! 9.19pm BST Oh, by the way, Erica also said that last night they did the technical run-through of the points announcements, and the guy who was standing in for the announcer from Iceland insisted that he would only give his douze points to Jaja Ding Dong, and much hilarity ensued. Jaja Ding Dong 9.18pm BST Regulars will know that sometimes we double-hand these blogs with someone at the venue and someone at mission control. With Covid and all that, this hasn’t been possible this year, however, I did actually have a spy in the camp last night. As luck would have it, one of my longest-standing friends, Erica Gray, was at the jury show/technical/dress rehearsal extravaganza with her husband. Giles Garnett (L) and Erica Gray at Eurovision in Rotterdam on Friday night. Photograph: Erica Gray Erica, who is British but has lived in the Netherlands for ages and is a citizen there now, told me about the atmosphere that “What the Dutch really do well is vocal and physical appreciation of live performances. Loads of clapping, whooping and standing ovations. The staging, lighting and production are incredible. The crew are working their arses off. The Greece effects were very cool to watch on stage. The dancers were running behind the green screen stairs to get changed.” And of my favourite? Erica said: “When the Ukrainian techno beat started the crowd went mental.” What else went down well? “Lithuania went down better live than I expected. Everyone loves Iceland. France is getting a lot of love. San Marino went a bit flat in the arena. Sweden has a good backstory that might bring in the votes. Plus of course the geopolitical voting tendencies. Ukraine really got the Dutch crowd going but I’m not sure about the audience vote.” On whether it felt safe being at the event, Erica said they “had a test in the morning. Results back in 20 minutes. Then showed a QR code on entrance to show we were negative. We had our face masks on when we were walking around the arena. Since everyone had been tested it felt a lot safer than going to the supermarket.” She said: “We both said that we’d be very happy to keep events like this from now on. Smaller crowds. Much better organised entry and exit. Loads of staff and volunteers to help and guide you, and a similar atmosphere to an Olympics among police, volunteers and staff.” 9.16pm BST I’ve got questions about the social distancing here but I admire the cheekiness of the request @MartinBelam I'm at uni, love the guardian.

There’s not much to say about this – it’s no Lordi. It’s perfectly competent at what it does, I just don’t think it’s what Europe is going to be voting for this year. Maybe in 2001 it would have done better? 9.13pm BST I don’t even know. That little bit where it slightly changes time signature or they play triplets or whatever makes it slightly worse somehow? That’s also clearly a ludicrous instrument – DRINK!!! I cannot explain. Photograph: Rolf Klatt/REX/Shutterstock 9.11pm BST Hahahahaha wow WTF? I’m glad I left this as a surprise. Oh my days. It’s like It’s A Knockout/Jeux Sans Frontières never went away. Oh my dear lord, I’m howling. 9.11pm BST 15. Germany I Don’t Feel Hate here from Jendrik representing GERMANY. This is another one of the “Big Five” that didn’t appear in the semi-finals so has the element of total surprise on this live blogger. I’ve learnt never to do that again if I’m ever allowed to cover the show again. 9.10pm BST She can hold that note, eh? 9.10pm BST This has made me laugh – it’s basically saying all the women singers at Eurovision when they see their costumes.

Watch the video instead. Ice creams! 9.06pm BST 14. MOLDOVA MOLDOVA are our next act. Natalia Gordienko will try and sweeten her path to victory with a song called Sugar. I know these puns are bad but it is getting late and I didn’t follow the late great Sir Terry Wogan’s advice about the alcohol, did I?

Spain This is a new one on me. I watched the semi-finals but in order to save some surprises for the night I’ve avoided the songs that had pre-qualified from the so-called Big Five.

Iceland You may have read that Daði og Gagnamagnið from ICELAND has had to pull out of the live show due to a positive Covid test within the band. There was always a back-up plan for this, so we’ll be seeing some rehearsal footage. The song is called 10 Years. Is it twice as good as David Bowie’s 5 Years? Frankly, no. Is it as good as their viral hit Think About Things which would have been last year’s entry and very possibly won it. Also, frankly, no. Is it good enough to do well though? Very much so – it’s in a similar ballpark to Think About Things, they’ve still got the whole kooky look and dance thing going on. Everyone remembers and loves them from last year. So a cheeky outsider maybe? 8.58pm BST This has improved every single time I’ve heard it – I don’t think this is going to trouble the scorers much but I’ve spent plenty of worse three minutes and that’s an impressive note hold at the end.

Photograph: Robin Utrecht/REX/Shutterstock 8.51pm BST 10. Greece With twelve points from Cyprus already in the bag, here comes GREECE. This year they are being represented by Stefania singing Last Dance and the performance incorporates some special visual effects in the form of live green-screening which I can only describe as very 1980s Rentaghost. It looks clever on your tellybox, but I’m not sure how well it comes across in the arena. 8.50pm BST I noticed someone in the comments suggested I should have added Graham Norton downplays UK expectations to the drinking game.

And perfect timing for a toast to Sir Terry Wogan who always suggested you needed a drink to get through broadcasting Eurovision but not to start until the ninth song. He didn’t, to my knowledge, specify any rules for live bloggers so I started my Eurovision “celebration” a bit earlier. Douze points for the cheesy publicity pose in this one, Mr Newman Hey the Fonz. Photograph: Sander Koning/EPA 8.45pm BST THREE FORMER EUROVISION WINNERS KLAXON!!! THREE DRINKS!!! 8.44pm BST While they are wittering on, Andy Abraham was actually a really lovely guy to chat to, and has been making post-pandemic plans. He’s been working with coffee retailer CoffeeFriend, and he’s looking to make a new album and go out on the road again. At the moment, however, he’s back on the bins. You may recall that when he was on X-Factor in 2005 he was nicknamed “The singing bin-man”. He told me that during the pandemic, with music work drying up, he’s got a job as a refuse collector again. Not just because of the money, he said, but also because “my own mental state and self worth. To show that no matter what the situation that arises, whatever the environment throws, you know I’m always going to be out there trying to keep my family safe and working hard for them.” We spoke about the impact the pandemic has had on the creative arts, and he echoed a theme I’ve heard in a lot of interviews I’ve done over the last few months, that it isn’t just the impact on the main performers, as Andy put it, it is “the interns, the freelancers, the lighting, the stage hands, all those type of people who this is all they know, and this is all they ever wanted to do. And that’s just been cut dead.” He didn’t say “the live bloggers” but without being too mawkish about it, I think that’s why I’ve found myself getting emotional tonight doing this – it’s just such a relief to have a fun show that so many people have worked hard to put on, and that hopefully you are all enjoying at home. Anyway, I digress… 8.44pm BST Before we get to the UK, I had a chat earlier this week with Andy Abraham, who you may recall was the UK’s entry in 2008, with a pretty straight down the line soul tune called Even If It didn’t go so well – he laughed when he said he still thanked Ireland and Malta for their support which hauled in all fourteen points that he scored. But he said being on Eurovision is something that can never be taken away, and that he still watches it today, viewing it as an iconic music programme just like Top of the Pops was. I asked him what his favourite Eurovision memory was, and he said it was the feeling when you come off stage doing the performance. He recalled “Backstage, especially all the cast and crew, they were all clapping like crazy. We love that song, it’s absolutely great. Even the head guy in control of the whole thing, backstage he was like ‘I love it, I love that song’. And I’m like, OK, you got some soul. Terry Wogan said ‘Great, loved your performance.’ So that’s my abiding memory of it. Once it got to the second vote, we just got hammered because we know exactly what was going to happen!” 8.43pm BST They snuck a CYNICAL KEY CHANGE™ into that at the end too. DRINK!!!! 8.40pm BST A full set of thigh-high boots here. DRINK!!! DRINK!!! DRINK!!! Serbia at Eurovision. Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/REX/Shutterstock 8.39pm BST 8. Serbia Hurricane are now doing the Loco Loco for us. They are representing SERBIA, and they have definitely been re-watching their old Destiny’s Child DVDs. 8.38pm BST What do I know, eh?

Photograph: Patrick van Emst/ANP/AFP/Getty Images 8.37pm BST Black and white footage doesn’t make the tune any better, mate, trust me. 8.35pm BST 7. Portugal Newly beloved by people in the UK as one of the few places we are allowed to visit at the moment – PORTUGAL are on the way. The Black Mamba will be signing Love Is on My Side. I’m definitely not on their side – I get a real Simply Red / Toploader b-side feeling about this one and there’s something about it that rubs me up the wrong way. You may feel differently about white-boy-faux-soul. Let me know in the comments how wrong I am. I know I said “no curmudgeons” below the line, but that doesn’t stop me having a moan up here, does it? 8.34pm BST Malta have been in Eurovision 34 times and their best showings have been two second place finishes. Could this be their year? Will we be heading to Valletta in 2022? If we are, will I be allowed to travel there? All this and more to be answered in the next couple of hours… Malta at Eurovision. Photograph: Robin Utrecht/REX/Shutterstock 8.31pm BST 6. Malta Viewers in the UK might recognise Destiny from Britain’s Got Talent, but tonight she is waving the flag for MALTA with Je Me Casse which everyone on the BBC keeps politely saying is French slang for “I’m leaving” or “I’m done” but I think the phrase has a bit more of a “…and fuck you tosspot” sub-plot to it. Or I want to believe that anyway. It has got a LOT of energy and I think it could score very highly. Honestly this is a good Eurovision night already isn’t it? 8.30pm BST We are going to VAR as to whether stepping out of the big dress while wearing the boilersuit is technically a costume change – and the result has just come in. DRINK!!! 8.29pm BST I desperately want the abandoned dress to drive itself off stage. 8.29pm BST On the face of it, this is a rousing feminist anthem, though an interesting choice to target the empowering lyrics specifically at Russian women, and not at “Eurovision women” or, more generally, the women of the world. My colleague Ben described it as “the kind of demented musical trifle for which Eurovision is justly famed”. I fancy it to do well. Russia at Eurovision. Photograph: Rolf Klatt/REX/Shutterstock 8.28pm BST It’s no grannies from 2012, is it? I love it. Yes, Russian grannies! Photograph: Vyacheslav Oseledko/AFP/Getty Images 8.27pm BST 5. Russia RUSSIA! This from Manizha is called Russian Woman and really is a lot of fun. She’s eating pizza in her postcard, and when you see her costume you might think she’s been stuffing her face with a little too much pizza. Not so – [SPOILERS!] there’s a dramatic metamorphosis ahead of us. 8.26pm BST I’m not sure, but I’m getting the researchers to check whether this is the first time that Johnny Cash has featured in the lyrics at Eurovision. 8.25pm BST Just to note as well, this Belgium entry is a song about a one-night stand gone wrong. If you are planning to have a one-night stand go wrong in the post-vax horny summer we are being promised, then Zoe Williams has got you covered for safer sex tips… Related: Is oral sex more Covid-safe than kissing?

Dr Steve Brule Photograph: Tim And Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! 8.24pm BST Probably the most distinctive thing about this is that lead singer Geike Arnaert looks like Lulu. Or Shirley Carter from EastEnders if you are feeling particularly unkind. Thigh-high boots though so DRINK!!! Belgium at Eurovision. Photograph: Robin van Lonkhuijsen/EPA 8.23pm BST 4. Belgium This band have been going since the 1990s and have got ten albums behind them. Do they have winning Eurovision ahead of them? I wouldn’t think so. Slightly surprising they emerged from the semi-finals to be honest, this is BELGIUM being represented by Hooverphonic with a song called The Wrong Place. It is very bland. 8.22pm BST It’s all glamour at home here by the way. I’ve even set up my Eurovision lava lamp. Live blogging #Eurovision tonight for the @guardian is very much a three screen operation pic.twitter.com/DH2pugEZiC — Martin Belam (@MartinBelam) May 22, 2021 8.21pm BST Costume change drink? I think so. DRINK!!! 8.20pm BST What are we making of the postcards? It is the one bit of the show I think where the limitations of filming under Covid restrictions shows a bit. It’s a nice idea, but not all of them work without actually dragging the artists all around the host country. 8.19pm BST 3. Israel ISRAEL next, with Eden Alene singing Set Me Free. Most of the pre-publicity around this song has been about whether she will successfully hit the highest note in Eurovision history as per her recorded version. 8.18pm BST I imagine this bit in rehearsal was like the SNL Cowbell sketch except Christopher Walken is at the side bellowing “I gotta have more dry ice!” Albania in Eurovision.

Albania ALBANIA will be blessing your screens next as Anxhela Peristeri sings Karma. No chameleons involved. If Cyprus had the James Bond costumes, then Anxhela Peristeri has bought a bit of the James Bond theme music vibe – a very dramatic opening to this track, then it sort of meanders off a bit in a pleasing but mostly ineffective manner. Albania in Eurovision. Photograph: Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images 8.13pm BST UNEXPECTED CHILDREN SUDDENLY SINGING ABOUT THE DEVIL AS IF IT WAS A NURSERY RHYME KLAXON The Omen. Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock 8.12pm BST It is a good chorus, right? However, this song loses marks for me because one of the writers is called Jimmy “Joker” Thornfeldt. I always feel like you have to be a bit of a funsponge to insist that people call you by the inevitably “wacky” nickname you’ve surely given yourself. Cyprus at Eurovision. Photograph: Robin Utrecht/REX/Shutterstock 8.11pm BST 1. Cyprus We are going to get off to a cracking start here with CYPRUS and Elena Tsagrinou who is singing El Diablo. Somewhere in the 1970s there’s a James Bond producer wondering where they’ve put the costumes for the women in the opening sequence. In the semi-final I wasn’t convinced her voice was powerful enough to carry the song, but it is a solid pop effort and will immediately get the arena going tonight. 8.10pm BST If you are in the UK I reckon by the end of the night the phrase “But you cannot vote by text” is going to be one of your pet hates. 8.08pm BST There’s been something of an arms race with the number of hosts the show has in recent years, and the Netherlands have opted for four. At this rate of host inflation by the time we get to the 2050 contest there will be more hosts than competing acts. Tonight you will be seeing (L-R): Edsilia Rombley who competed in Eurovision in 1998 and 2007 and has an impressive music career. Chantal Janzen is an experienced television presenter in the Netherlands. Jan Smit who is a musician and who has also done live commentary on Eurovision for a decade. Nikkie de Jager, who is also known by her YouTuber name NikkieTutorials and is making history as the first transgender host of the competition. Her coming out video has over 37 million views on YouTube. Edsilia Rombley, Chantal Janzen, Jan Smit and Nikkie de Jager. Photograph: Robin Utrecht/REX/Shutterstock 8.07pm BST What you haven’t seen yet – the fans!!! Fans in the Ahoy Arena in Rotterdam. Photograph: Rolf Klatt/REX/Shutterstock 8.06pm BST I’ve just realised that this new flag parade artist entry format means you are basically going to be plastered with the thigh high boots drinking game rule right from the off. Literally all the boots revealed in one go. DRINK!!! 8.03pm BST Graham Norton on the BBC sounds quite emotional already. At least you can’t hear me sobbing, and I can assure you that there will be no repetitive flashing images on this blog. 8.01pm BST [EUROPEAN BROADCASTING UNION THEME INTENSIFIES] Are you ready? I hope I am. 7.57pm BST One thing I was going to say that also made me love Eurovision more was that I lived in Greece for a couple of years, and as an outsider looking in at how they viewed the competition it was a fascinating contrast with the slightly awkward relationship we have tended to have with it in the UK. For a start, you genuinely heard tracks from the show in cafés and on the radio, and the kids who lived in the apartment across the road from ours had the CD and used to spend ages making dance routines to the songs in the street. It was lovely and made it feel much more than a one-off night. And just a warning as well, if you didn’t watch the semi-finals. Prepare yourself. I actually found it quite emotional when they struck up the band on Tuesday night. Eurovision genuinely feels like a bit of light after a very dark winter. It will be interesting to see how the main show treads the line between full on glitzy excitement at being there, and some recognition that across Europe there has been, and still will be, a lot of grief. I’m not convinced that the Brit awards or the Oscars trod that line terribly deftly. I think this probably will. 7.52pm BST The BBC have put tonight’s running order into a Twitter card so I don’t have to type it all out. Personally, this is genuinely worth the licence fee alone. We are so EXCITED for tonight!

There’s always our Eurovision quiz if you missed it yesterday… Related: Will you get douze points? Take our fiendish Eurovision quiz 7.45pm BST The UK’s entry – James Newman – has already had his hands on the coveted trophy. Just for a publicity still, mind you. He tweeted earlier asking people for their support and to help by visualising him winning. You never, ever know… The Law of attraction! It works! That’s the reason im here today about to perform in front of 180 million people! If everyone does it tonight and visualizes the win, who knows what could happen!

Lesley Roy and her song Maps had a unique staging where she appeared to be running through books and trapped in an origami forest with forced perspective making her part of the scene. It was very effective. A montage of scenes from Ireland’s Eurovision entry. Photograph: Eurovision Well, very effective on TV. In the arena … hmm … perhaps less so … The pullback reveal of Ireland’s Eurovision set. Photograph: Eurovision Towards the end, the pullback revealed that if you were in the hall, she’d just basically been running around some very, very, very small boxes while a massive camera on a crane obscured your view. The song was alright though, and I am still surprised it didn’t squeeze in. The video is worth three minutes of your time though as a warm-up. Lesley Roy – Maps 7.34pm BST So talking of cracking songs we’ve missed out on, we have been robbed – ROBBED I TELL YOU – of seeing NORTH MACEDONIA. I’ve no idea why it didn’t get through. Singer Vasil is openly gay which is a big deal in a very conservative country which legalised same-sex sexual activity in 1996 but has a poor record on LGBT rights. He told Attitude magazine: “I was born and raised in (North) Macedonia where it is definitely not OK to be gay, or any of that. Every time I came back home to the Balkans, to (North) Macedonia, you feel this need to put on a mask. I sympathise so much with everybody here that lives in fear of judgement, discrimination, injustice, bullying.” Vasil from North Macedonia in the semi-final. Photograph: Robin van Lonkhuijsen/EPA Here I Stand managed to mix the feel of something from near the climax of Act I of a decent musical, with a touch of Queen. But most importantly, halfway through the song, Vasil pulled open his costume to reveal that he was only a goddamned HUMAN GLITTERBALL!!! Vasil the human glitterball. Photograph: Sander Koning/EPA How people did not vote for this on Tuesday I will never, ever know. Heathens! 7.30pm BST I don’t know how many of you will have watched the semi-finals? I must confess I used to be a semi-final refusnik because I thought it rather spoiled the effect of seeing everything for the first time on the big night, never knowing if somebody was about to pitch up in folk costumes with a live sheep* and a rustic nose-flute or something. However I’ve been converted in recent years into watching all the shows because sometimes there are cracking songs that don’t make it through, and also, surely, in the true spirit of the contest, you want to also actually see the very worst that Eurovision has to offer. [*I’m told live animals are not permitted on stage during the show by the rules.] 7.26pm BST I know former hosts of this live blog – waves to Heidi and Stuart – have often suggested some kind of drinking game to go with the show. Personally, the drinking game for me is to find out whether I can still live blog and co-ordinate a snap breaking news story while drunk at the end of the night. You don’t have to worry about that however, so if you do want to take part, I’d like to suggest these rules. A drink when you spot: Someone says “it’s great to be back”! Someone says “a wonderful show”! A former winner of Eurovision appears! A costume change! A cynical key change! Ludicrous musical instruments! Thigh-high boots! An excruciating guitar solo! Unexpected interpretative dance in the bagging area! A guest appearance by a well known US rapper that just co-incidentally and luckily for the organisers due to the genuinely random nature of the draw ends up finishing the whole show (NOTE TO EDITOR: is this too obvious here that I know this is going to happen and also am a bit suspicious of how convenient it is?) Please drink responsibly. Non-alcoholic beverages are also available. When the fun stops, stop. No, hang on, that’s gambling, isn’t it? 7.23pm BST I absolutely love this from musician Mary Epworth just now, who has succinctly hit the nail on the head about what for me is one of the real joys of Eurovision. You get a bit of the musical language of each country, but also mixed in is what each country thinks all the others will like. — The Wicker Marv (@maryepworth) May 22, 2021 7.19pm BST You’ll notice I’m new here, by the way. Just so you know where we are coming from, I unashamedly love Eurovision, watched it as a kid, watched it with ironic post-modern detachment when I was a pretentious twentysomething, and then have grown to truly love it and introduce it to my own kids as the wonderful, glorious and absolutely ridiculous celebration of music that it is. But I don’t take it too seriously, so if you are here for the latest betting tips and an accurate inside track on what is going to win, I’m not your man. If, on the other hand, you are here for stupid jokes, instant social media reaction, and me occasionally getting over-enthusiastic about things and SHOUTING ABOUT THEM IN ALL CAPITALS BRIAN BLESSED STYLE then we are going to get along famously. If you want to get in touch you can find @-me on Twitter at @MartinBelam. Or you can email me at martin.belam@theguardian.com with EUROVISION at the start of the subject line. That way I’ll find it in my inbox, which is otherwise mostly full of unread urgent pleas from my editors to actually meet my deadlines. 7.15pm BST Welcome to the 2021 Eurovision song contest Bienvenue!

I feel a bit emotional already to be honest. Lots of the artists who should have had their moment of Eurovision glory last year are back for another bite, including the UK’s James Newman and Iceland’s Daði og Gagnamagnið, who may well feel that they would have won with Think About Things in 2020, and that we should be in Reykjavík tonight, not Rotterdam. That’s all in the past though, and there is plenty to look forward to.","Id":"tv-and-radio/live/2021/may/22/eurovision-song-contest-2021-rotterdam-netherlands-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webTitle":"Eurovision 2021: Italy win Eurovision as UK scores nul points again – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2021/may/22/eurovision-song-contest-2021-rotterdam-netherlands-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/live/2021/may/22/eurovision-song-contest-2021-rotterdam-netherlands-live-updates","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts","wordcount":8565,"webPublicationDate":"2021-05-22T23:13:39Z","id":"tv-and-radio/live/2021/may/22/eurovision-song-contest-2021-rotterdam-netherlands-live-updates","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Sweden 1-2 Ukraine (aet): Euro 2020 last 16 – as it happened","body":"10.54pm BST Some way to end this absurdly entertaining Round of 16, eh?

Ukraine will play England in the quarter final in Rome on Saturday night. Swedish coach Jan Andersson wears the look of a man who has just been mugged, which is understandable given the brutal way his Euros have suddenly ended.

There will be three added minutes. And in the first ... 10.30pm BST ET 29 min: Bezus goes down in the Swedish box after being shoved lightly in the back by Helander. He looks to have hurt his shoulder. It’s been 30 extra minutes of complete carnage. 10.27pm BST ET 28 min: Bezus comes on for Sydorchuk. 10.27pm BST ET 27 min: Malinovskyi whistles a snapshot past Olsen’s left-hand post. The keeper always had it covered. 10.26pm BST ET 26 min: A free kick for Ukraine out on the left. Everyone lines up on the edge of Sweden’s box. Malinovskyi goes direct for goal from the best part of 30 yards. His low drive deflects left to Zinchenko, who can’t get a shot away. 10.24pm BST ET 25 min: Ukraine have upped the tempo, hoping to press home their numerical advantage and get this done without a shootout. 10.23pm BST ET 23 min: Sydorchuk makes good down the inside right and backheels, in the hope of finding Karavaev, racing into the box. The ball’s loose. Karavaev clatters into Berg, who cops a knee in the face as the pair accidentally collide. On come the physios, for more ice-pack action. 10.21pm BST ET 21 min: What a miss!

Helander should clear, but fresh-air swipes and slips on the edge of his own box, nearly letting Tsygankov in. Helander recovers just in time, but hearts were in Swedish mouths there. 10.16pm BST ET 17 min: A slow and scrappy start to the second period of extra time, as we move inexorably towards a shootout. Here’s John Davis: “Would disagree slightly about the red. It’s clearly a sending off as he endangered his opponent, but I have some sympathy in that he won the ball which was a decent distance away and obviously wasn’t aiming at the man. However, definite red - ended the other lad’s tournament and was unwittingly reckless. You would have got hammered until a few years ago for NOT going in for that. Red cards for tackles like that should have been brought in years ago and saved a few careers. I’m sure I’ve contradicted myself there at least twice.” 10.15pm BST Ukraine get the second half underway. Yarmolenko’s race is run, so on comes Dovbyk. 10.13pm BST EXTRA TIME, HALF TIME: Sweden 1-1 Ukraine We’re just 15 minutes from penalty kicks.

The ball pings off Krafth’s temple, knocking the poor chap into next week. He eventually sits up, but looks extremely groggy. 10.06pm BST ET 13 min: As play goes on, Besedin is helped gingerly around the perimeter. A huge ice pack on his knee. He’ll not be playing against England if Ukraine get through. 10.04pm BST ET 11 min: Danielson had some nerve complaining about that red card. Besedin’s knee hyperextended under the pressure and he can’t continue. Tsygankov comes on in his place. Meanwhile the Swedes react to Danielson’s dismissal by sacrificing Olsson for Helander. 10.02pm BST RED CARD: Danielson (Sweden) ET 9 min: VAR runs a check. The referee goes over to the screen. It’s a horrible challenge, studs high on Besedin’s leg, bending it awkwardly. He seems affronted when he’s told to do one, but that’s the correct decision. A dreadful challenge.

He’s righteously piqued about that decision. 9.38pm BST 83 min: Augustinsson trudges off, to be replaced by Bengtsson ... and then Lustig makes way for Krafth. 9.37pm BST 82 min: Augustinsson goes down with cramp already. Lustig was struggling a couple of minutes ago, too. Extra time could be a journey. 9.35pm BST 80 min: Yarmolenko is booked for yammering away at the referee. 9.34pm BST 79 min: Sweden suddenly pick up the pace a little, Forsberg and Kulusevski very nearly one-twoing their way clear down the middle. The Ukraine back line refuses to yield. 9.33pm BST 77 min: The tempo drops considerably. Both teams are perhaps considering the looming prospect of extra time, and conserving energy accordingly. 9.31pm BST 75 min: Stepanenko has a belt from distance. Ekdal blocks. Ukraine go back to stroking it around the back, making Sweden do all the chasing. 9.29pm BST 74 min: Ukraine respond with some sterile possession, which is better than no possession. 9.28pm BST 72 min: Sweden are bossing this now. A lot of possession, a lot of passes. A long period of probing in Ukraine’s final third comes to an end when Lustig impatiently crosses from the right to nobody in particular. 9.25pm BST 70 min: Kulusevski is booked for a cynical tug on Zinchenko. 9.25pm BST 69 min: Lindelof makes down the middle like Beckenbauer in his prime, then feeds Forsberg down the left. Forsberg glides infield, evades a couple of blue shirts, and sends a power curler, meant for the top right, flush off the bar! So close to a stunner! Sweden’s Emil Forsberg hits the crossbar with a shot. Photograph: Lee Smith/Reuters Updated at 9.48pm BST 9.23pm BST 67 min: From Sweden’s corner, Ukraine break upfield, and Yarmolenko shoots from just inside the box. His sidefoot towards the bottom right is easily gathered by Olsen. 9.22pm BST 66 min: Forsberg forces a corner down the left. He takes it himself, and takes it long. The ball finds Kulusevski on the other flank. He enters the box, drops a shoulder, and aims powerfully for the top left. Bushchan tips brilliantly over for another corner. Fine save. 9.20pm BST 65 min: Malinovskyi clatters into the back of Olsson, and is fortunate to escape a booking. 9.19pm BST 63 min: Sydorchuk has time and space near the right-hand corner flag, having been found by a left-wing cross that evaded everyone in the box. He loops, hoping to find the head of Yarmolenko in the middle, but it’s an easy pick for Olsen. Good luck predicting which team will score the next goal. This is good fun. 9.17pm BST 61 min: Ukraine make the first change of the evening, replacing Shaparenko with Malinovskyi. 9.17pm BST 60 min: Sweden should be leading. Ekdal wedges a lovely defence-splitter down the middle to release Isak. The young star draws Bushchan but lifts his shot wide right. He might have been offside, but it would have been mighty close, and one for the old VAR. 9.15pm BST 59 min: Forsburg finds Augustinsson down the left. Augustinsson crosses low and hard. Larsson is waiting to tap home, only for Sydorchuk to hook clear, just in time. A good, open game, this! 9.13pm BST 56 min again: Now it’s Sweden’s turn to hit the woodwork! Isak counters down the right wing at speed and drifts infield. He’s got Forsberg to his left. He feeds him. Forsberg opens his body and shapes a shot around Bushchan, towards the bottom-right corner ... and off the base of the post! Goal kick. In a parallel universe, it’s now 2-2. 9.11pm BST 56 min: Yarmolenko dribbles down the right, causing havoc once more. He reaches the byline and cuts back for Sydorchuk, who curls powerfully towards the top-right corner. The ball twangs off the outside of the post. Goal kick. Had that been on target, Olsen wasn’t getting anywhere near it. 9.09pm BST 54 min: A bit of space for Larsson, 25 yards out. He drags a poor shot well wide of the bottom left. 9.09pm BST 53 min: Yarmolenko continues to cause Sweden problems, grooving his way down the right and crossing. Sweden only half clear. Shaparenko tries to return the ball with interest but shanks weakly wide left from 20 yards. 9.07pm BST 52 min: Then suddenly one long clearance nearly undoes Sweden. Yarmolenko threatens to latch onto it and bear down on goal, but his plan is scuppered by Olsen, who races from his box and blooters clear. 9.07pm BST 51 min: Sweden are throwing a lot of people forward. Forsberg is seeing a lot of the ball. Ukraine are holding their shape. 9.04pm BST 49 min: Yarmolenko whistles a low cross in from the right. Danielson does very well to clear with opponents lurking. 9.02pm BST 47 min: Sweden spend the first couple of minutes of the second half knocking the ball around at a notably higher tempo. 9.00pm BST Sweden get the second half at Hampden underway. No changes yet. 8.49pm BST Half-time advertisement. “This link between Will Ferrell and Sweden explains his antipathy towards Norway,” writes Bob O’Hara. “We’re still waiting for the pizza he said he ordered us.” Updated at 8.52pm BST 8.46pm BST HALF TIME: Sweden 1-1 Ukraine Mind you, that doesn’t stop the referee blowing for half time three seconds early. 8.45pm BST 44 min: This game took a while to get going, but the period since the opening goal has been good fun. 8.44pm BST GOAL! Sweden 1-1 Ukraine (Forsberg 43) Out of nothing, the Swedes are level! Forsberg latches onto a loose ball, 30 yards out. He takes a stride down the inside-left channel and aims for the right-hand side of the goal. His shot takes a deflection off the heel of Zabarnyi, and flies into the top left! Emil Forsberg of Sweden scores their side’s first goal. Photograph: Petr Josek - Pool/Getty Images Forsberg, second right, celebrates. Photograph: Stu Forster/AP Updated at 9.14pm BST 8.42pm BST 41 min: Kulusevski drives into the Ukraine box from the right. He clatters straight into Matviyenko. He asks for a penalty, but neither referee nor VAR shows interest, and nor should they. 8.41pm BST 40 min: Sweden push Ukraine back. They ping a few passes together, but never look like breaking into the box. Suddenly Sydorchuk intercepts and zips up the park. A poor pass towards Yarmolenko, out to the right, saves a light-at-the-back Sweden. 8.39pm BST 38 min: “I think you understate the quality of Yarmolenko’s outside of the boot assist,” writes Kári Tulinius. “Zidane would’ve been proud. At first glance it looked like a defensive error by Sweden, but the absurdity of that pass would’ve caught anyone off guard. A piece of art.” 8.37pm BST 36 min: Olsson dribbles with purpose down the middle, but finds there’s no route into the box. He slips wide right to Larsson, who overhits a cross to nobody. Sweden come again, down the same flank. Larsson’s cross this time is weak and straight into the hands of Bushchan at the near post. 8.35pm BST 34 min: Yarmolenko is seeing an awful lot of the ball. He races down the right again, but there’s nobody in blue keeping pace with him and he’s forced to turn tail. After a slow start, Ukraine are now on top. 8.33pm BST 32 min: Yarmolenko is barged over as he makes good down the right. Free kick. It’s looped long and only half cleared by Ekdal. Yarmolenko - who has by now swapped flanks - tries to replicate Zinchenko’s volley, but sends his effort high over the bar. 8.31pm BST 30 min: The resulting corner comes to nothing, easily claimed by Bushchan. “Will Ferrell has been a football fan his whole life,” reports Mary Waltz. “He was a decent High School player, he is a part owner of the LAFC MLS side and he has promoted both the US men’s and women’s team so he is not just a parvenue looking for attention. The Swedish connection is through his wife as previously stated.” 8.30pm BST 29 min: A free kick for Sweden out on the right. Larsson shapes to loop it towards the gaggle of players on the edge of the box, but whips a trick shot towards the bottom right. Bushchan is wise to the grift, getting across to tip around the post. What an effort, and what on-point goalkeeping! 8.29pm BST GOAL! Sweden 0-1 Ukraine (Zinchenko 27) All of a sudden, Hampden erupts! Shaparenko sprays a lovely diagonal pass towards Yarmolenko on the right. Yarmolenko drops a shoulder and scoops a cross towards Zinchenko, romping in from the left. Zinchenko meets the dropping ball and creams a shot towards the bottom right. Olsen gets a hand to it, but is beaten by the pace. A lovely goal! Ukraine’s Oleksandr Zinchenko scores. Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA Zinchenko (right) celebrates. Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA Updated at 8.49pm BST 8.27pm BST 25 min: It’s not an energy piece, this. Yesterday suddenly seems a lifetime ago. “Jim Broadbent is a dead ringer for the king of Sweden in that video,” notes Johannes in Gothenburg. I am the Inadvertent Weaver. 8.24pm BST 23 min: Hampden is fairly quiet right now. No drama, no roar. 8.23pm BST 21 min: A little bit of sterile possession for Ukraine in the middle of the park. “Which match have you obliterated from your memory banks (20.00 reference to 43rd game)?” wonders Richard Hirst. “My guess would be England v Scotland.” I missed that one, I was on US Open golf duty. Did anything happen earlier today? Let’s say that. 8.20pm BST 19 min: Isak is sent scampering down the inside-left channel by the busy Karavaev. He takes a touch infield and lashes a low diagonal shot inches wide of the right-hand post. A fine effort by La Liga’s young player of the year. 8.19pm BST 18 min: Kulusevski sashays down the right and hooks deep for Forsberg, who can’t keep his header down or on target. The ball sails harmlessly out for a goal kick. Emil Forsberg of Sweden in action. Photograph: Andy Buchanan/EPA Updated at 8.26pm BST 8.18pm BST 17 min: The referee accidentally barges into Olsson, so stops the match. Drop ball. It’s like that. 8.16pm BST 15 min: This game is open enough, yet nothing’s really happening. Yet. Plenty of time for it to turn into yet another instant classic. 8.15pm BST 13 min: Another Swedish corner out on the left. Forsberg takes and loops it straight down Bushchan’s throat. Very poor. Here’s Neil Shull: “Sweden may have a comedian who is a fan, but Ukraine have a president who is a comedian.” This isn’t some Boris-the-clown-style satire; Volodymyr Zelensky actually is a comic. 8.12pm BST 11 min: A neat one-two between Yaremchuk and Yarmolenko opens Sweden up down the right. The former batters a shot straight at Olsen from a tight angle. The keeper palms it away. 8.11pm BST 9 min: Shaparenko advances on the Swedish goal and nearly hits the right-hand corner flag with his shot. So in lieu of meaningful action, here’s Hakan Burden with a translation of Ferrell’s teamtalk. “You are so clever! You are so strong! You are so quick! You play really well! We are Swedish fans, all of us. We are Swedish fans, all of us. Come on [names different players by first or nick name].” Ferrell’s wife is Swedish, is the root of all this. Updated at 8.12pm BST 8.07pm BST 7 min: Augustinsson crosses dangerously from the left. The ball drops to Kulusevski, whose shot is deflected out for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece. 8.05pm BST 5 min: A fairly nondescript start, it has to be said. 8.04pm BST 3 min: Lustig sends a long ball into the Ukraine box, hoping to find Forsberg. Bushchan comes off his line and punches clear, albeit in a slightly uncertain style. 8.03pm BST 2 min: Hampden is far from full, but there’s plenty of vocal support for Ukraine, who pass it around the back for the first couple of minutes. Everyone gets a feel. 8.00pm BST Here we go, then! The 43rd match of Euro 2020, and the final Round of 16 tie. Who will England face in Rome on Saturday evening? Ukraine get the ball rolling as we set about finding out. 7.58pm BST The teams are out! Sweden are in their storied yellow shirts, forcing Ukraine into second-choice blue. We’ll be off in a couple of minutes, once coins are tossed and pennants swapped. Incidentally, Sweden are being cheered on this evening by a well-known fan ...

But I’m nervous so it feels good having someone famous supporting Sweden.” In the interest of balance, if there’s footage out there of Andriy Shevchenko’s squad being given a pep talk by Adam Sandler, we’d love to hear about it. Updated at 8.04pm BST 7.42pm BST A bit more on Sweden, who are trying out a third strike partnership in four games. Dejan Kulusevksi was forced to isolate at the start of the tournament due to a positive Covid-19 test, but he came on against Poland and set up two goals, including Viktor Claesson’s late winner. He’ll team up this evening with Alexander Isak. Marcus Berg, who started the first two group games against Spain and Slovakia, joins Robin Quaison, selected against the Poles, on the bench. 7.29pm BST The national anthems. Ukraine’s anthem, Shche ne Vmerla Ukrainy ni Slava, ni volia, is an avant-garde earworm waiting to happen. Soul and body, yea, our all, offer we at freedom’s call We, whose forebears, and ourselves, proud Cossacks are That’s a nice suit, that’s a swanky suit All together now: “With an arm across the torso / Face on the pale monkey nails.” Sweden’s national song, Du gamla, du fria, has an equally catchy refrain. Yes, I want to live, I want to die in the North “MY north.” 7.07pm BST Sweden make one change to the XI named for the victory over Poland. Dejan Kulusevski replaces Robin Quaison, who drops to the bench. Ukraine make two changes to the team selected for the defeat to Austria. Serhiy Kryvtsov and Taras Stepanenko are in; Ruslan Malinovskyi and Vitaliy Mykolenko are benched. 6.55pm BST The teams Sweden: Olsen, Lustig, Lindelof, Danielson, Augustinsson, Sebastian Larsson, Ekdal, Olsson, Forsberg, Kulusevski, Isak. Subs: Bengtsson, Berg, Johnsson, Svensson, Helander, Sema, Krafth, Claesson, Jansson, Quaison, Nordfeldt, Cajuste. Ukraine: Bushchan, Karavayev, Kryvtsov, Zabarnyi, Matviyenko, Shaparenko, Stepanenko, Sydorchuk, Yarmolenko, Yaremchuk, Zinchenko. Subs: Sobol, Malinovsky, Marlos, Pyatov, Makarenko, Tsygankov, Mykolenko, Bezus, Besyedin, Trubin, Tymchyk, Dovbyk. Referee: Daniele Orsato (Italy). 6.51pm BST You obviously heard there was another football match on tonight. Yep, the winners of this will face England in the quarter-finals in Rome this Saturday!

The shock defeat of the Dutch? The end of Portugal’s reign? Manic Monday? Whatever’s happening in the England-Germany game that hasn’t finished yet? Yep, this straggler has a fair bit to live up to. Few are expecting. Thing is, nobody was making any great claims for Italy-Austria, Croatia-Spain or France-Switzerland beforehand. And yet all of those matches, with incremental levels of magnificence and sheer jaw-dropping wonder, delivered. Why not this one? Both teams have already been involved in a 3-2, Ukraine coming back from two goals down against the Dutch only to lose, Sweden shipping a two-goal lead against Poland only to win. Perfection may be a pipe dream; fun and thrills are not. Also, this is being played at Hampden Park, where the most famous fixture involving two visiting teams from mainland Europe finished 7-3. It’s all part of the mix. Fingers crossed. Here’s to a spectacular finish of a sensational Round of 16, then. Don’t let us down, Sweden. Come through for us, Ukraine. Kick off is at 8pm BST. It’s on!

After a gruelling lockdown period during the coronavirus pandemic, Italians were once again able to sip cappuccino and cold beers – albeit at a physical distance from other customers. “I haven’t worked for two and a half months. It’s a beautiful, exciting day,” Valentino Casanova, a barman in Caffe Canova in Rome’s central Piazza del Popolo, told Reuters. A handful of visitors, including nuns, queued up outside St Peter’s for the first time since 10 March. Police officers wearing face masks checked temperatures before allowing them to enter. Masses in churches across Rome also resumed. Worshippers sat apart on disinfected pews. In Venice gondoliers wearing face masks ferried passengers along the Grand Canal, while mothers with small children sat in cafes overlooking the Rialto. Clients in Milan got their hair done, while local markets in the city of Salerno reopened. The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, described the ending of national curbs as a “calculated risk”. Italy was the first European country to go into full lockdown, more than two months ago. It is now returning to a semi-normality, after nearly 32,000 deaths. Its economy has shrunk by 10%. Other European countries followed suit on Monday. Spain indicated that it would allow tourists to return from the end of June and Poland allowed restaurants to reopen as part of its third phase of lockdown easing. Greece welcomed the first visitors back to the Acropolis. Workers in masks and plastic face shields stood around the archaeological site in Athens, reminding people to keep apart as they entered through turnstiles. The country has recorded only 156 deaths from Covid-19. The president, Katerina Sakellaropoulou, visited the Acropolis on Monday. She hailed it as “a world monument that continues to inspire with its marbles shining under the sun”. A visitor at the Acropolis in Athens, which reopened on Monday. Photograph: Miloš Bičanski/Getty Images Greeks are now allowed to travel freely and to visit the country’s two biggest islands, Crete and Evia. Shopping malls and zoos have reopened, together with sports facilities for those aged over 13. Wearing of masks is recommended but not compulsory, except on buses and trains. In Spain, almost three-quarters of the country progressed to the second phase of lockdown de-escalation. Millions of people were able to meet up in groups of up to 10, and to have a drink or a meal on cafe or restaurant terraces. In Valencia masked waiters laid out tables overlooking the municipal beach. The transport minister, José Luis Ábalos, said the country would end two-week quarantine restrictions at the end of June, and would fully reopen its borders. The move would take place at the same time internal travel restrictions were phased out. “From late June, we’ll start the tourism activity, I hope,” Ábalos said. “We must make Spain an attractive country from the health point of view.” In recent days the UK has seen a sudden sharp increase in Covid-19 infection numbers, leading to fears that a second wave of cases is beginning. Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics. Until now that had been what was expected from Covid-19. How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity. Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave? This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden resurgence in infections despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak. Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in cramped dormitory accommodation used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens. Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it. In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions. What are experts worried about? Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies. However Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, says “‘Second wave’ isn’t a term that we would use at the current time, as the virus hasn’t gone away, it’s in our population, it has spread to 188 countries so far, and what we are seeing now is essentially localised spikes or a localised return of a large number of cases.” The overall threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available. In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with a vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves. Peter Beaumont, Emma Graham-Harrison and Martin Belam The Madrid region and the Barcelona metropolitan area remain in the preliminary phase of what the government has called “the transition towards the new normality”. The health ministry said that despite “huge progress” in and around the capital, the region would not yet be able to join the 70% of the country in the next phase. People in Barcelona and parts of the Castilla y Léon region will also remain in the so-called phase zero for the time being. Churches and cathedrals in some areas of Spain have been open and operating at the required 30% capacity for a week, but the Sagrada Familia, Barcelona’s most visited tourist attraction, remains closed. Spain’s overnight death toll from coronavirus was 59 on Monday, the lowest figure in two months, the government said. The cumulative total rose to 27,709, with 231,350 confirmed cases of the virus. Over the weekend the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said his Socialist-led coalition would be seeking a final, month-long extension of the state of emergency that underpins one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe. Millions of people in Spain are now able to meet in groups of up to 10, and to have a drink or a meal on cafe and restaurant terraces. Photograph: Kai Foersterling/EPA Meanwhile, Ireland took a cautious step on Monday towards easing its lockdown by allowing some businesses to reopen and up to four people from different households to meet as long as they respected physical distancing. Gardening centres, hardware stores, bicycle repair shops and outdoor construction are among the handful of sectors cranking back to life, in the first phase of a five-stage plan to lift restrictions spread out over three-week intervals, with the fifth and final phase due to start on 10 August. “We all need to approach the coming days with care and caution, and to show some collective cop-on,” said Simon Harris, the health minister, using an Irish term for common sense. “We want the shops to stay open, so there’s no need to rush down to your local DIY centre or garden shop today.” On Sunday the country reported 64 new cases of Covid-19, the lowest daily figure since mid-March. Testing and contact tracing has expanded, bolstering confidence in the ability to monitor and contain outbreaks.","Id":"world/2020/may/18/global-report-italy-reopens-cafes-as-spain-prepares-for-return-of-tourists","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Global report: Italy reopens cafes as Spain prepares for return of tourists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/global-report-italy-reopens-cafes-as-spain-prepares-for-return-of-tourists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/may/18/global-report-italy-reopens-cafes-as-spain-prepares-for-return-of-tourists","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":842,"webPublicationDate":"2020-05-18T14:17:30Z","id":"world/2020/may/18/global-report-italy-reopens-cafes-as-spain-prepares-for-return-of-tourists","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"'Stop this madness': NYT angers Italians with 'smoky tomato carbonara' recipe","body":"The New York Times has cooked up a controversy in Italy after tinkering with the recipe for the classic Roman dish pasta carbonara. Called “Smoky Tomato Carbonara”, the recipe, by Kay Chun, was published by NYT Cooking. To be fair to Chun, she did preface her version of the recipe by saying that “tomatoes are not traditional in carbonara, but they lend a bright tang to the dish”. But it wasn’t just the tomatoes: the recipe replaced guanciale with bacon, “since it’s widely available and lends a nice smoky note”, and used parmesan cheese instead of pecorino. The indignation began among passionate foodies on social media – “This isn’t remotely close to being a carbonara. Stop this madness,” wrote one – before attracting the ire of top Italian chefs and the farmers’ association Coldiretti, which described “Smoky Tomato Carbonara” as the “tip of the iceberg” in the “falsification” of traditional Italian dishes. This isn’t the first time an interpretation of an Italian recipe has sparked outrage, with foreigners often mocked for adding pineapple to pizza or chicken to pasta. But that the recipe was published by the NYT came as a shock. “I follow the NYT on Instagram and thought it was a fake,” Alessandro Pipero, a chef in Rome known as “the carbonara king”, told Corriere della Sera. “It would be like putting salami in a cappuccino or mortadella in sushi. OK, fine, but then let’s not call it sushi, similarly with this one – carbonara with tomato is not carbonara. It’s something else.” Coldiretti was sterner in its reaction. “The real risk,” the association said in a statement, “is that a fake ‘made in Italy’ dish takes root in international cooking, removing the authentic dish from the market space, and trivialising our local specialities which originate from unique techniques and territories.” Coldiretti added that pasta carbonara was one of the most “betrayed” Italian recipes abroad. But the association is keeping track of plenty of others. “Caprese is served with industrial cheese instead of mozzarella di bufala or fior di latte, while there are also cases of pasta with pesto served with almonds, walnuts or pistachios instead of pine nuts.” The NYT also triggered outrage in the UK in 2018 after publishing a recipe in which it described the yorkshire pudding, a roast dinner staple, as a “large, fluffy pancake” that was excellent for “breakfast, brunch, lunch and dessert any time of the year”.","Id":"food/2021/feb/25/stop-this-madness-nyt-angers-italians-with-smoky-tomato-carbonara-recipe","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webTitle":"'Stop this madness': NYT angers Italians with 'smoky tomato carbonara' recipe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/feb/25/stop-this-madness-nyt-angers-italians-with-smoky-tomato-carbonara-recipe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2021/feb/25/stop-this-madness-nyt-angers-italians-with-smoky-tomato-carbonara-recipe","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":402,"webPublicationDate":"2021-02-25T12:19:38Z","id":"food/2021/feb/25/stop-this-madness-nyt-angers-italians-with-smoky-tomato-carbonara-recipe","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Walking round the world in a day – in Ljubljana, Slovenia","body":"‘Would you go round the world with me?” I asked a friend on the phone. “Wow! But the pandemic …” she said. I interrupted her, “Ljubljana is near the 46th parallel north and if we follow it west there are 16 countries along it. Italy first, then Switzerland …” Now, she interrupted me: “The borders are closed. Flights cancelled. We have a curfew. In fact, we’re not even allowed to leave the province.” Slovenia, and adjacent countries, map “We won’t. We will walk round Ljubljana, from embassy to embassy following countries on the 46th. We start at the Italian embassy tomorrow morning.” Not every country on the 46th has an embassy in Ljubljana but most do. I mapped the route on the Google app and it came to 27km. I optimised it to avoid zigzagging, and we were left with 20. “Are you in?” She laughed, which usually means yes. The Italian embassy lies just outside the centre of town, towards the south-west, appropriately close to the wall left behind by the Romans. The town has long outgrown the wall, but despite this there are still allotments close by, tended by older women who you could, until recently, still see pushing along carts full of lettuce to sell at the central market. We agreed that for us the mention of Italy brings to mind food and then art, and it is sometimes difficult to tell the two apart anyway. I grew up in a town close to the Italian border and watched Italian films and TV as a child, but pizza places were nonexistent in socialist Yugoslavia. Being poor we didn’t travel, my grandmother was more interested in the afterlife than food, so we had boiled potatoes every day. Ljubljanica River and the old central market and Triple Bridge, Ljubljana. Photograph: Getty Images By the time I had survived the first decade of my life I passionately hated them. And then – a miracle! The company my mother worked for organised a trip to Rome for its staff and she took me with her. I was even given some pocket money so I could buy myself the pizza I had been dreaming of. Indeed, after much searching, I found a place where I could afford one and the waiter placed the menu in front of me. I couldn’t understand a word so I pointed to one with my finger. I got a pizza where the dough was made of potatoes not flour. Of course, most of the embassies are in the centre of town. Three large town villas are huddled together, the American embassy that looks a little like a fortress, the German one covered in technology (automotive!) and scientific posters, and the Russian one behind them. In between them is a nursery school and children, finally together again after a long time, duly loud. A little to the east, close to the railway station, is the Serbian embassy and next to it, on the ground floor, a shop selling Austrian hunting weapons and equipment. In view of the fact that the first world war started when Austria (the Austro-Hungarian Empire) attacked Serbia, I must admit that I was slightly surprised by the combination. US embassy in Ljubljana. Photograph: Alamy I discovered that I know nothing about certain countries. When I hear the name Kazakhstan, I smile, and I have noticed this effect is common. This is merely because of a fictional character, no need to mention names, who has hijacked the country in a sort of media-promotional colonialism, and I can just imagine people from Kazakhstan when asked abroad where they are from, watching people’s faces already laughing at the inevitable joke that will follow. At least all that people do with us Slovenes is mix us up with Slovaks. Moldova does not have an embassy in Slovenia but its consulate is in a commercial building on the north side of a forested hill that the town has already enveloped and now seems like part of its centre. It is damp and shady, with water trickling down it in tiny streams, branched out like veins. The walk would have been a short one had some of the embassies not been on the outskirts of town. We turned east to get to the Chinese embassy, alongside the river, past the main hospitals of Ljubljana with large marquees erected outside them for Covid testing. When we reach the embassy, we first see one building with a flag, then the next with a coat of arms, and it seems as if they are constantly expanding it, house by house, and it has become almost a mini settlement, all the facades snow-white, identical railings and CCTV cameras all round it. Furthest out, beyond the motorway ring road, already at the hills and forests of the suburbs, is the Hungarian embassy. If Kazakhstan was hijacked by Borat (arrgh, I’ve mentioned his name!), Hungary has been hijacked by Orbán. It is as if its inhabitants no longer exist. In Slovenia he dominates all news from Hungary. People I knew there have either left or withdrawn into themselves. We Slovenes are currently watchful of Orbán, since our prime minister is trying to be his best friend though he is at best his clone. Chinese embassy. Photograph: Miha Mazzini Travelling round the world from embassy to embassy proved to be an excellent way of getting to know our town. We walked through parts we had never been in before and parts we would normally just drive through. Humans are designed for observing at walking pace. At times it seemed like a journey through time. On the outskirts, a working farm with all the associated smells. Then the remnants of an industrial estate alongside the railway line, with a single factory still operating. We saw a van draw up with a sign that said Pig-on-a-Spit. The driver didn’t even have to beep his horn, the smell was so strong that the factory doors opened and workers in blue overalls came out and stood in line. Or perhaps he had just timed it right. We crossed large residential estates with socialist-era blocks of flats. They were mostly put up in the 1980s on what were green areas outside the boundaries of town, but they are no longer on the outskirts. Sprawling beyond them are endless family homes on a Slovene scale that always fascinates foreign visitors as they are built with the notion that at least three generations of a family should live in the same place. After walking for four and a half hours we were back in the centre of town and bought ourselves a takeaway pizza. We carried it round the corner, to the steps by the river, taking pleasure eating it and feeling the exhaustion numbing our joints, knowing we would groan when we got back to our feet. “It’s funny, I always wake up with a bout of travel anxiety, strong reisefieber, at three in the morning before travelling, and it also happened to me last night, even though our trip was just a walk,” I said. My friend laughed, “What about travelling around the world along the meridian next week?”","Id":"travel/2021/mar/09/walking-round-the-world-in-a-day-in-ljubljana-slovenia","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webTitle":"Walking round the world in a day – in Ljubljana, Slovenia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/mar/09/walking-round-the-world-in-a-day-in-ljubljana-slovenia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2021/mar/09/walking-round-the-world-in-a-day-in-ljubljana-slovenia","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":1169,"webPublicationDate":"2021-03-09T06:30:48Z","id":"travel/2021/mar/09/walking-round-the-world-in-a-day-in-ljubljana-slovenia","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Two recipes for endive from Rachel Roddy","body":"The second nearest trattoria to our flat is our local. I have long given up on trying to be objective about Piatto Romano; years of meals, celebrations, consolations and over-familiarity means it is in its own odd category. We know its strengths and failings; the things we like to eat (and things we don’t), and in what order. We know the thick smells to expect when we walk through the door; the weight of the tumblers and fabric of the orange napkins; the way the salty crackers crumble; and the trolley. The trolley sits in the arch between the two rooms; occasionally it is trundled across the second room to a table. But most of the time it sits up against the yellow wall, a static mobile home for seven or eight large white dishes containing vegetables: mostly boiled, some braised, others baked, boring or trusty, depending on your point of view. The vegetables vary depending on the time of year, but not as much as you would imagine: they’re invariably green. This is because Rome is full of green, and especially at this time of year, when markets and shops are fully charged with spinach and chard, cabbage, literally tonnes of artichokes, fluorescent broccoli romani, kale, celery, borage, tufty mixes of wild greens, chicory and endive that have grown wild for thousands of years, and still do, but are also cultivated. An abundance of green that is rarely reflected in trattorias, osterias and pizzerias, and their usual offering of one chicory, one potato and one green salad. But the trolley at Piatto Romano offers plain green satisfaction: cooked well, and served as they come. Artichokes braised whole until murky green and velvet-soft, or fried until a bronze crisp; bitter green salads whose ability to wince and pucker have been tamed by washing, and a dressing of anchovy and sumac. There is also a sense of function: the greens doing a job. The classic roman pastas, thick and rich with guanciale and pecorino, braised rabbit or veal with chestnut-coloured gravy, all seem to demand a twisted pile of spinach, bitter chicory or endive, whether boiled in well-salted water or braised in their own juices. It is the endives I particularly like at this time of year, the unruly wig of indivia frisée and the broad, smooth and gently ruffled-leaved scarola (AKA escarole or batavia). Like chicory, the endive family – wild cicoria, catalogna, radicchio and forced witloof (confusingly called French endive) – belong to the genus Cichorium, which in turn belongs to the asteraceae family, which includes lettuce and dandelion. While they do share in common the bitter cichorium gene, endive, curly frisée and escarole are also sweet – especially the pearly white stem – and can be eaten as a sturdy salad. I like scarola: the whole head picked over, washed, dried and ripped into bite-sized pieces, and thoroughly dressed (six tablespoons of olive oil, one tablespoon of honey vinegar, one tablespoon of balsamic or red-wine vinegar, and some salt), then tossed again with sliced pear and gorgonzola, or bacon and toasted hazelnuts, or served with a bitter orange, anchovy and garlic dressing. Then there is cooked endive, the idea of which I found bizarre; counterintuitive, even, until I realised that the sturdy leaves are transformed in the same way as pak choi, from crunchy to plump and velvet-like. I have lost objectivity about this dish, and I like everything about it: washing the leaves in cold water so I get red hands, and the smell of the garlic and chilli. I like the way it collapses into a pile of sweet, bitter, sour, hot flavours, which I always get stuck in my teeth. Scarola in padella (braised escarole with olives, pine nuts and currants) Escarole cooked in this way make the filling of Neapolitan pizza di scarola, which has an olive oil crust. Today it is a trolley or side dish for fish or meat, grilled cheese or rice. Prep 10 min Cook 15 min Serves 2 as a main, 4 as a side 1 large head scarola or frisée 6 tbsp olive oil 2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed but still whole 1 good pinch dried red chilli flakes 1 handful black olives 1 handful pine nuts 1 handful currants Salt Break the head of the scarola or frisée into leaves, discarding any that are either damaged, very large or tough. Wash in plenty of cold water, then drain and blot well. In your largest frying pan over a medium-low heat, warm the oil, garlic, chilli, olives, pine nuts and currants, until the garlic is lightly golden (but watch it doesn’t burn). Add the leaves to the pan. Use two wooden spoons to press and turn the leaves, which will wilt down. Cook, stirring often, for five minutes, until the excess water evaporates. Add salt and more oil to taste, cook for a couple more minutes, then serve. Scarola, pear and gorgonzola salad Prep 15 min Serves 4 as a side 1 large head scarola or frisée 6 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp red-wine or balsamic vinegar 1 tbsp honey vinegar 100g gorgonzola, broken into pieces Salt 1 large, ripe pear, peeled and sliced Break the head of the scarola or frisée into leaves, discarding any that are either damaged, very large or tough. Wash in plenty of cold water, then drain and blot well. Make the dressing by shaking or whisking together the olive oil, vinegar, a little of the cheese and a pinch of salt. Rip the leaves into bite-sized pieces and put into a large bowl. Pour over the dressing and use your hands to toss really well. Add the pears and remaining cheese, then toss again before serving.","Id":"food/2020/jan/27/two-recipes-for-endive-from-rachel-roddy","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webTitle":"Two recipes for endive | A Kitchen in Rome","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/27/two-recipes-for-endive-from-rachel-roddy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2020/jan/27/two-recipes-for-endive-from-rachel-roddy","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":935,"webPublicationDate":"2020-01-27T11:00:50Z","id":"food/2020/jan/27/two-recipes-for-endive-from-rachel-roddy","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Italian fashion needs to confront its racism, say industry insiders","body":"How culpable is Italy in fashion’s current race crisis? Very, according to black members of the Italian fashion industry. When the media cites examples of fashion houses co-opting centuries-old racist imagery and making it new (Gucci’s blackface jumper, Prada’s golliwog trinket, Dolce and Gabbana’s pizza advert) one commonality is often overlooked: Gucci, Prada and Dolce & Gabbana are Italian companies. Related: Vogue has a race problem. It can't be fixed with a few token black models | Priya Elan “Knowing the culture, I’m absolutely not surprised these racist clothes originate from Italian fashion houses,” says Edward Buchanan, who runs the knitwear label Sansovino 6 and moved to Milan from the US in the 90s. “Everyone is prepared to say: ‘Oh, we’ve put a black or mixed-race model on the catwalk, or on the cover of a magazine,’ but behind the scenes there are no black designers or merchandisers.” Kudzai King, a photographer who has shot for Vogue Italia, says that the attitude toward BAME people in Italy is a “fascination and a dislike all at once”. He recalls entering “multiple elevators where I am the only black person in there and felt a thick atmosphere of discomfort”. He describes a climate where “people want to touch your skin, your hair and ask you some really uncomfortable questions that are derived from a place that is lacking knowledge”. A model for Gucci’s autumn/winter 2018-19 collection is seen at Milan fashion week. Photograph: Antonio Calanni/AP Related: 'Woke' fashion brands face backlash for not practising what they preach Buchanan says that when he left New York to join the luxury Italian fashion brand Bottega Veneta in 1995, he felt like an outsider: “In this industry I’ve always had the impression that if you were black the majority of Italians thought you were African and selling [fake] Prada bags on the street.” The Rome based designer Stella Jean took a stand when the micro-aggressions became too frequent. “During last Milan fashion week I decided not to showcase my collection, since the racial issue in Italy was no longer acceptable,” she says. “I could not remain silent and hold a fashion show, as if nothing serious was happening.” Instead, she focused her efforts on Italians in Becoming, a photography and video project that highlighted the multiculturalism of 20 Italian women. She says the project was ignored by the Italian fashion press, because the idea of Italian identity is such a sensitive topic. “Most of [the magazines] didn’t even respond. Some institutions go as far as suggesting not collaborating with me anymore.” The blowback Jean encountered is indicative of how contentious the idea of “Italian identity” is. In February the model Maty Fall Diba appeared on the cover of Vogue Italia with the coverline “Italian Beauty” and Diba holding the word “ITALIA” close to her body. But Daniele Beschin, a councillor for the hard-right League party, said she was not an “Italian beauty” because she did not have the right skin colour (Diba was born in Senegal and grew up in the Italian city of Chiampo). “That’s a real issue,” says Buchanan. “You speak to an Afro-Italian who lives in Milan, who speaks Milanese, and they are considered African. As a culture Italy is not ready to say: ‘This person is Italian.’” In the aftermath of the blackface jumper and trinket scandals, Gucci hired Renée Tirado as their diversity chief while Prada set up a diversity council (and it was announced that the creative director, Miuccia Prada, was having racial sensitivity training). For Jean, these moves miss the point. “I find it absurd that we need them, when the simple application of common sense should allow each of us to direct these energies elsewhere,” she says. Related: Racism is at the heart of fast fashion – it's time for change | Kalkidan Legesse Buchanan agrees. “You need to talk to the executive recruiting firms who are blocking black and brown people from getting jobs at the company. You need to talk to educational systems and ask why black and brown people are not arriving at design school. You cannot even have a real conversation about inclusiveness or diversity if you’re not diverse on the inside.” Buchanan says the root of Italian fashion’s race problem is a colonial history that no one really talks about. “In Valenza I go to have a coffee and it’s served to me in a mug with a black mammy figure on it,” he says. “No one questions that, and if you do you get an arrogant defensiveness. Italians think racism is something which happens over the water in America, but no one talks about the colonial history in Somalia, Eritrea and Libya,” he says. “I’m not sure those conversations are happening in educational systems.” Jean speaks of “extreme fatigue” around the admission of racism in Italy. “But that doesn’t justify the constant denial.” He says the next step involves a deeper change of philosophy in the Italian psyche. “A coherent first step would be to talk to us, instead of talking about us.”","Id":"fashion/2020/jun/29/italian-fashion-needs-to-confront-its-racism-say-industry-insiders","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webTitle":"Italian fashion needs to confront its racism, say industry insiders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jun/29/italian-fashion-needs-to-confront-its-racism-say-industry-insiders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2020/jun/29/italian-fashion-needs-to-confront-its-racism-say-industry-insiders","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":781,"webPublicationDate":"2020-06-29T04:00:23Z","id":"fashion/2020/jun/29/italian-fashion-needs-to-confront-its-racism-say-industry-insiders","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Amazon investigated in Germany over lockdown price controls – as it happened","body":"12.13am BST We are closing the live blog now, but you can stay up to date on all of the latest coronavirus developments on our new global live blog below.

The German Federal Cartel Office is investigating the allegation that Amazon abused a market-dominating position during the coronavirus pandemic. Localised coronavirus restrictions in some parts of the North of England could be lifted this week, after around 4.5 million people in Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and West Yorkshire were subjected to a new lockdown more than two weeks ago. Brazil on Sunday reported 23,101 new coronavirus infections, taking the overall tally to 3,340,197, as well as 620 new deaths. France said on Sunday that 236 coronavirus infection clusters were being investigated in the country, as the daily number of new confirmed cases rose by more than 3,000 for the second day in a row. Israel will relax some social distancing restrictions from Monday, allowing up to 20 people to gather indoors and up to 30 people in open spaces. Jordan will seal off the city of Ramtha near the Syrian border from Monday amid the largest daily rise in four months in coronavirus infections. Ireland’s health chiefs will meet on Monday to decide if further restrictions are needed to slow a sharp increase in the spread of coronavirus that the government and officials have described as deeply concerning. Italy’s decision to shut discos and clubs and make it compulsory to wear a mask outdoors in some areas at night comes as cases of coronavirus pick up across the country, especially among younger people.

Deaths rose by 483 on Sunday, with Florida, Texas and Louisiana leading the rise in fatalities. The US has at least 5.4 million confirmed coronavirus cases in total, the highest in the world and likely an undercount as the country still has not ramped up testing to the recommended levels. Cases are falling in most states except for Hawaii, South Dakota and Illinois. US president Donald Trump appears with governor Kristi Noem in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP Public health officials and authorities are concerned about a possible fall resurgence in cases amid the start of the flu season, which will likely exacerbate efforts to treat the coronavirus. Centers for Disease Control director Robert Redfield warned the US may be in for its “worst fall” if the public does not follow health guidelines in an interview with Web MD. Months into the pandemic, the US economic recovery from the recession triggered by the outbreak is still staggered, with some hot spots slowing their reopenings and others shutting down businesses. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation is anticipating an uptick in Covid-19 cases in the coming months, resulting in around 300,000 total deaths by December, and a nearly 75% increase in hospitalisations. Worldwide there are at least 21.5 million coronavirus cases and over 765,000 confirmed deaths. The United States remains the global epicenter of the virus, with around a quarter of the cases and deaths. 11.36pm BST Jacinda Ardern is coming to the end of this news conference. She says she had never considered moving the election out by a year, as she said some other countries have done. “We are not proposing to push out for a long period of time,” she says, reiterating that the vote will still happen in the constitutional time allocated for this parliament. She acknowledges the potential anxiety caused by delaying the election, but says she wants to assure all voters that their voices will be heard on election day. New Zealand spent 102 days with no new cases of Covid-19, until last week, when four new cases in the city of Auckland were reported. This city was returned to Level-3 lockdown rules - initially for 3 days, but that was extended on Friday out to 26 August. The rest of the country is alert level 2. As of Sunday, there were 69 active cases of Covid-19, including 49 cases from the community. 11.14pm BST New Zealand will delay its national election due to coronavirus New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has moved the general election to 17 October, a month later than the original date of 19 September. Ardern says the biggest risk to overcome will be ensuring 25,000 election workers are well-protected as they go about their work. Ardern said she considered moving the election by just 2 weeks, but the election commission said this wasn’t enough time for them to prepare for the new date. “I am proposing that parliament reconvene tomorrow,” Ardern said, “Under the circumstances, I consider it important that parliament can consider these issues.” Parliament will now dissolve on 6 September. Advance voting will start on Saturday, 3 October. The governor-general has been advised of the new election date. “Covid is the world’s new normal,” Ardern said. “I know the uncertainty Covid has caused is incredibly difficult...I do not intend to change the election date again.” New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern speaks to media during a press conference on 17 August, 2020 in Wellington, New Zealand.

The new regulations, to go into effect on Monday at 7pm, will also allow gatherings of up to 30 people in an open space. The number of total coronavirus cases in the country rose to 92,680 on Sunday, of which 23,491 are active, while the death toll has risen to 685. There are 382 patients in serious condition. A committee leading the coronavirus response in Israel’s Arab society reported a rise of about 1,600 new cases within a week, bringing the total number of cases among Israeli Arabs, not including East Jerusalem and mixed Jewish-Arab cities, to 9,908, with 3,600 of them considered active cases. Officials say one of the main reasons for the rise in cases are large gatherings in weddings, in spite of restrictions in place limiting crowds. 10.47pm BST Localised restrictions in North of England 'could be relaxed within days' Tight localised coronavirus restrictions in some parts of the North of England could be lifted this week, after around 4.5 million people in Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and West Yorkshire were subjected to a new lockdown more than two weeks ago in a bid to contain local infection clusters. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham told the Daily Mirror newspaper that he believes rules banning people from mixing with other households in homes or gardens will be relaxed, possibly borough-by-borough, and depending on infection rates. He said: “Hopefully, we will begin to see some people getting released. “If things stay as they are I think it is likely that we would see a change.” Burnham said that while curbs would remain and possibly tighten in the worst-hit areas, they would be eased in parts where cases have dropped. “Our cases are flattening – with one exception, Oldham – and we are starting to turn the tide in most of our boroughs. The hope is, maybe we will have a better time ahead of us,” he said, adding that numbers could “change quite dramatically in four, five days,” and would be reviewed weekly.

As with previous orders, the one issued Saturday says residents and visitors of the state are strongly encouraged to wear face coverings when they are outside of their homes, except when eating, drinking or exercising outside. But unlike previous orders, this one allows local governments in counties that have reached a threshold requirement to require the wearing of masks on government-owned property, the Associated Press reports. A county meets that threshold requirement if it has had 100 or more confirmed cases of Covid-19 per 100,000 people over the previous 14 days. Only two of Georgia’s 159 counties were below that threshold, according to data from the state Department of Public Health.

Photograph: John Bazemore/AP Local mask mandates cannot result in fines, fees or penalties against private businesses or organisations, and penalties against individuals for non-compliance cannot included a fine greater than $50 and cannot include prison time, the order says. Local mask requirements can’t be enforced on residential property and can only be enforced on private property, including businesses, if the owner or occupant consents to enforcement, the order says. This order also protects Georgia businesses from government overreach by restricting the application and enforcement of local masking requirements to public property,” governor Brian Kemp said in a news release accompanying the order, which is in effect through 31 August. “While I support local control, it must be properly balanced with property rights and personal freedoms,” he added. 9.30pm BST Jordan will seal off a city near the Syrian border from Monday following the largest daily rise in four months in coronavirus infections, which officials say have come mainly from its northern neighbour. The health ministry said half of the 39 cases recorded in the last 24 hours were from Ramtha city, near the Syrian border. Officials say truck drivers and individuals entering the kingdom from the Jaber border crossing with Syria are spreading the virus. Ramtha will be isolated as of Monday with the authorities re-imposing restrictions on movement in the first such reversal of a provincial area since the authorities eased a nationwide lockdown last June, Reuters reports. Jordan, with one of the lowest infection cases in the region, has reported 1,378 cases and 11 deaths from Covid-19. The spread of cases from Syria prompted the kingdom last Wednesday to impose a week-long closure of the Jaber border crossing, a trade artery for Syrian and Lebanese transit goods to the Gulf and Iraq. Prime minister Omar al Razzaz said on Sunday that tougher measures at the border crossing would be imposed in the next few days given the spike in neighbouring countries and complacency in applying social distancing and health safeguards. “We don’t want, God forbid, to have a second wave,” Razzaz said. In addition to measures, such as increased testing, Razzaz said the authorities will increase the number of caravans to house hundreds of truck drivers and Jordanians arriving from Syria who are put under quarantine.

During the first months of the pandemic, there were complaints that Amazon had blocked retailers because of allegedly excessive prices. “Amazon must not be a price controller. That also applies now,” Mundt said. Mundt described Amazon as an indispensable platform for many retailers. “On the other hand, we have so far not formally established market dominance,” he added.

Ireland has reopened its economy at a slower pace than most EU countries but that has not prevented a jump in cases over the last two weeks that led to the first localised reimposition of some restrictions last week. After reporting the highest number of daily cases since the beginning of May on Saturday, 66 more on Sunday pushed the 14-day cumulative number of cases per 100,000 population to 23, the country’s acting chief medical officer, Ronan Glynn, said. Ireland’s incidence rate is higher than those of the UK and Germany, having previously been among the lowest in Europe for a number of weeks. “NPHET [Ireland’s public health team] has been monitoring this very closely and will meet formally tomorrow afternoon to consider if any additional recommendations need to be made to government,” Glynn told the national broadcaster RTÉ. “We’ve seen cases all across the country in the past 14 days so we will need to consider what needs to be done in that context.” Glynn, who discussed the situation with the prime minister, Micheál Martin, and senior ministers earlier on Sunday, urged people to avoid crowds and to reduce their social contacts. He described footage shared widely on social media over the weekend of a bar in Dublin where customers crowding around the counter were shown having drinks poured into their mouths as reckless and said it could not be tolerated. “This cannot continue. This pandemic isn’t over just because we are tired of living with it,” he said. Updated at 8.09pm BST 7.31pm BST Italy’s decision to shut discos and clubs and make it compulsory to wear a mask outdoors in some areas at night comes as cases of coronavirus pick up across the country, especially among younger people. New infections in the past week were more than double those registered three weeks ago, and the median age of people contracting the virus has dropped below 40, Reuters reports. The new rules will start on Monday, two days after an Italian holiday when many young Italians go out dancing, and will run until early September. Masks will be required between 6pm and 6am in areas close to bars and pubs and where gatherings are more likely. “We cannot nullify the sacrifices made in past months. Our priority must be that of opening schools in September in full safety,” the health minister, Roberto Speranza, said on Facebook. Updated at 7.42pm BST 6.58pm BST The UN Palestinian refugee agency has confirmed four new Covid-19 deaths in camps in Lebanon, and called for vigilance in observing hygiene measures as infections rise across the country. “During the past 24 hours, four deaths have been recorded among Palestine refugees” in Lebanon, UNRWA said. It brings the total number of Palestinian refugees who have died from Covid-19 since Lebanon first recorded an outbreak of the virus in February to eight. More than 200,000 Palestinian refugees reside in Lebanon, the majority living below the poverty line while their right to work and own property is restricted, according to UNRWA. Lebanon has seen a spike in coronavirus-related cases and deaths, including 397 new infections on Saturday alone. That brought the total number of infections to 8,442, including 97 deaths. A planned lockdown was abandoned in the wake of the massive explosion that ripped through large parts of the capital, Beirut, on 4 August. Updated at 7.42pm BST 6.47pm BST Mississippi’s Republican governor, Tate Reeves, says the fact that residents of his state will have to vote in person during the Covid-19 pandemic is not a problem, my colleague Tom Lutz reports. “We do not allow mail-in voting in the state of Mississippi. We think that our election process, which has been in place for many, many years, ensures that we have a fair process in which we have the opportunity to limit fraud,” Reeves told CBS on Sunday. According to Johns Hopkins University, Mississippi has the highest positivity rate in the US, with 19.5% of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the last seven days. Again, Reeves does not see that as a concern. “Every vote that is legally cast in the state of Mississippi will be counted in the November election and I’m confident that once all of those votes are counted that Donald J Trump is going to win Mississippi and many other states,” Reeves said.

It was the second day in a row that new infections surpassed the 3,000 mark. One further death was reported, taking the total official toll in hospitals and nursing homes to 30,410. There were 4,860 people in hospital with Covid-19, including 376 in intensive care units. People queue at a testing site in Paris.

Several members of the Bolsonaro family have fallen sick with Covid-19. Brazil has the second highest number of cases in the world after the United States. Michelle’s grandmother died from the disease this week, Jair himself was ill in July, and his fourth son, Jair Renan, has tested positive. “Thank you for your prayers and for all your acts of love,” Michelle Bolsonaro said in a post on social media announcing her test result. As of Saturday, Brazil had 107,232 deaths attributed to coronavirus and 3.3 million confirmed cases. Jair Bolsonaro and his wife, Michelle.

Trudeau and his finance minister, Bill Morneau, are due to meet on Monday to try to sort out their differences, said a fourth source. Morneau and his team have pushed back against other cabinet ministers about how much funding was needed, including to what extent the recovery could be helped by investing in environmental projects, the sources added. Trudeau, who campaigned on a platform to tackle climate change, believes the 2021 budget should have an ambitious environmental element to start weaning the heavily oil-dependent economy off fossil fuels, and has recently hired the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney as an informal adviser, aides say. Bill Morneau at a news conference with Justin Trudeau in March. Photograph: Blair Gable/Reuters The appointment, coupled with a Globe and Mail report that Trudeau and Morneau had clashed over the amount of money Ottawa is spending to combat coronavirus, led to speculation about the future of the finance minister. Morneau, 57, has been in the job since the Liberals took power in late 2015. Trudeau’s spokesman Cameron Ahmad said the prime minister had issued a statement on Tuesday saying he had “full confidence” in Morneau, who confidants say is alarmed by ballooning budget deficits. Updated at 7.37pm BST 5.24pm BST After a meeting on Sunday afternoon with regional authorities, the Italian government has decided to close all discos in the country and to make mandatory wearing masks in outdoor public spaces where it is not possible to practice social distancing. The decision follows a rapid increase in coronavirus infections: for the first time since May and for three consecutive days, Italy registered more than 500 new coronavirus cases per day, most of which concern holidaymakers returning from Croatia, Spain, Greece and Malta. The fear of a new lockdown has begun to spread among Italians as the country registered 479 new cases and four deaths on Sunday. Updated at 7.35pm BST 5.15pm BST The British government faces the threat of legal action and criticism from its own MPs after it sparked anger by mishandling English exam grades. After a nationwide lockdown forced exams to be cancelled, the government used an algorithm to assess grade predictions made by teachers, and lowered grades for almost 40% of students taking their main school-leaving exams. That process led many students to lose places at universities they had previously been offered. Results show that grades were less likely to be lowered for students who attended fee-paying private schools, while bright students at traditionally poorly performing schools have had results downgraded, often dramatically. On Saturday night the exam regulator published guidance on an appeals process, only to withdraw it hours later because it needed further review. The barrister Jo Maugham said his Good Law Project had appointed solicitors to pursue litigation on behalf of students, and urged the government to launch a suitable appeal system in time for students to go to college in September, Reuters reports. Students receive their A-level results Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images Robert Halfon, the Tory chair of the cross-party education select committee in parliament, described the removal of the appeal guidance as farcical. “It sows confusion among pupils, head teachers and school teachers, and it’s the last thing we need at this time,” he told the BBC. Updated at 6.15pm BST 4.55pm BST Over in Cyprus, more cases of coronavirus have been recorded today, with the health ministry in the island nation’s internationally recognised southern sector announcing seven new infections, bringing the total tally to 1,339. Three of those who tested positive for the virus were tourists and repatriated Greek Cypriots, according to authorities. The Mediterranean island has handled the pandemic better than other EU member states, but in recent weeks has seen a flare-up of cases, particularly around the marina of Limassol.

Democrats have accused Donald Trump of trying to hamstring the cash-strapped postal service to suppress mail-in voting. DeJoy has been donating to Trump’s campaign. Trump said on Thursday he had held up talks with Congress over a fresh round of coronavirus stimulus funding to block Democrats from providing more funds for postal voting and election infrastructure. “[DeJoy’s] testimony is particularly urgent given the troubling influx of reports of widespread delays at postal facilities across the country as well as President Trump’s explicit admission last week that he has been blocking critical coronavirus funding for the postal service in order to impair mail-in voting efforts for the upcoming elections,” the House oversight and reform committee chairwoman, Carolyn Maloney, said in a statement.

Updated at 6.09pm BST 4.32pm BST Conservative MPs have told the health secretary, Matt Hancock that businesses will suffer unless the government takes a more sophisticated approach to the blanket restrictions affecting 4.5 million people across northern England, my colleague Josh Halliday reports. Ministers announced on Friday that people across large swaths of the north and the city of Leicester would remain under tighter restrictions for a third week as the coronavirus infection rate continued to rise in some areas. The measures, introduced with a few hours’ notice on 31 July, ban people in the affected areas from visiting family and friends and from socialising with other households in pubs or restaurants.

I won’t always be able to respond, but tips are always much appreciated. 4.01pm BST Island nations have an advantage when it comes to stopping travellers importing disease, be it Covid or other infections. Seas are usually harder to cross than land, and beaches are easier to police. There are no cross-border towns, and fewer ways to sneak over frontiers. These advantages, combined with strict quarantine policies, have made island nations some of the most successful at containing Covid. But the ones that did best shut themselves off from the world to varying degrees. And a fresh outbreak of cases in New Zealand last week suggests coronavirus can evade even tight controls. Experts say the lack of special border measures in the UK before lockdown was a “serious mistake” that significantly increased the pace and scale of the epidemic. Even now, the UK’s quarantine measures – for selected countries and with limited enforcement – appear to be nowhere near as comprehensive or effective as those used by other island nations. Related: Island nations have the edge in keeping Covid away – or most do Updated at 6.06pm BST 3.58pm BST The Irish government has expressed “deep concern” at a rise in Covid-19 cases in the country. Ireland recorded 200 new cases on Saturday – the highest daily number since the start of May. A government spokesman said: The taoiseach, tanaiste, Green party leader, health minister and acting CMO met this morning to discuss the evolving Covid-19 situation and to examine the recent spike in cases. They expressed deep concern at yesterday’s figures. There will be a further analysis of the situation ahead of the cabinet committee on Covid, which will meet again on Tuesday. Updated at 6.03pm BST 3.41pm BST The German state of Bavaria has said it has tracked down most of the people returning from abroad who tested positive for coronavirus but were not told about it, in a debacle that embarrassed a possible successor to chancellor Angela Merkel, Reuters reports. Bavaria said it had found 903 of the 949 people who tested positive out of a total of 44,000 travellers returning to the country, but it could not locate personal data for 46 of the positive tests. The tests were carried out up to two weeks ago at special centres that were opened with great fanfare in the southern state. Problems with data entry meant that the travellers were kept waiting for their test results for days. The Bavarian state premier, Markus Soeder, apologised for the problems on Thursday, promising to fix the mistakes by adding extra staff. He also said he supported his health minister, who had offered to resign. Some conservatives see Soeder as the best candidate to run for the chancellorship in next year’s election, succeeding Merkel who has said she will not stand for a fifth term. Soeder has so far said he will stay in Bavaria. Germany has managed to keep the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths relatively low compared with other European countries but there are concerns about a possible second wave. On Saturday Germany saw the biggest increase in confirmed coronavirus cases since late April, a rise of 1,415, but on Sunday the increase was just 625, although fewer cases are usually registered at the weekend. Updated at 6.04pm BST 3.36pm BST Firms from the United Arab Emirates and Israel have signed an agreement to jointly develop research and studies on coronavirus, UAE state media reported. The business deal comes days after a surprise political agreement on Thursday between the UAE and Israel to normalise relations, a historic shift that will make the Gulf state only the third Arab country to establish full diplomatic ties with the Jewish state. The UAE’s Apex National Investment and Israel’s TeraGroup signed the “strategic commercial agreement” late on Saturday in Abu Dhabi, AFP reports. “We are delighted with this cooperation with TeraGroup, which is considered the first business to inaugurate trade, economy and effective partnerships between the Emirati and Israeli business sectors,” said the Apex chairman, Khalifa Yousef Khouri. Updated at 6.06pm BST 3.31pm BST Dozens of students have sat down on the floor at the front door of the Department of Education in London, UK, as hundreds filled the street. They are protesting against the downgrading of thousands of students’ A-levels by an algorithim that accounted for schools’ historical performance, effectively discriminating against high-achieving children at schools that have had low performance. Exams were cancelled in the UK due to the pandemic, though they went ahead in some countries such as Germany. The protesters chanted “vote them out”, “fuck Eton” and “come out Gavin” (in reference to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson), with many demonstrators holding signs referencing the next election. Maya Szollosy, 18, from London, said: We’re voting age now, most of us, and we’re young. We’re going to remember this for many years until the general election and I don’t think many students are going to vote for the Conservative party after what they did to us. A science teacher who did not wish to give her name, said: I think this is the biggest attack on the working class probably since Thatcher, or at least the most brazen. This is going to be devastating, particularly for the working class, including black and minority ethnic students. I’ve seen that up to 2 million GCSE kids are going to get downgraded potentially, so I’m so scared for them, my heart is breaking for these kids.

The potential exposure took place just days after the Brass Rail Tavern, one of the city’s best-known strip clubs, was allowed to reopen. The employee worked four shifts in early August, the city said in a statement, without detailing the capacity in which the employee worked. Public health officials said they had reached out to clients who had left their details in the establishment’s contact tracing log, urging them to get tested and self-isolate. However, public health experts questioned how many patrons would have handed over legitimate contact information.

Public Health Wales said the total number of cases in the country had increased by 18, bringing the revised total of confirmed cases to 17,561. Updated at 2.58pm BST 2.43pm BST Greece will only flatten the curve of a second coronavirus wave now gripping the country if diagnosed cases drop below 200 a day, a leading infectious disease expert has warned. Gkikas Magiorkinis, an assistant professor of hygiene and epidemiology at Athens University, said it was imperative that infection rates were kept below 200 for the pandemic to remain under control, following a fourth straight day where it passed that threshold. The prediction is, if it is kept below 200 then the number needing to be intubated is manageable. If not, we will have to impose more measures, especially in larger cities like Athens and Thessaloniki where half the Greek population lives and where we have larger densities of transmission.” On Saturday the National Organisation of Public Health, EODY, announced that 230 people had tested positive for the novel virus over the preceding 24-hour period, saying 27 of the new cases were imported with international arrivals. Relative to other European countries, Greece has done relatively well in keeping the pandemic under control, registering 6,858 cases and 226 deaths to date. But authorities have reported a worrying rise in cases in August, with health officials attributing the sharp uptick in part to incoming tourists but also lax observance of health protocols and other compliance measures domestically. Magiorkinis, one of a number of expert scientists advising the government, acknowledged that increased testing also played a role in increased numbers of diagnoses, but said his chief concern was transmissions spreading to vulnerable sectors of society if the increase was not brought under control. If we can keep the number below 200, we can flatten the curve. If not, my concern is that eventually transmissions might reach the people who are most vulnerable in care homes and hospitals He said Greece was seeing the impact of its effective coronavirus reproductive rate, or R number, reaching 1.1 around 15 days ago. On Friday the government announced further containment measures including midnight curfews on bars and restaurants in popular island resorts and large urban centres. Magiokinis, who formerly taught at Oxford University, said among the additional measures being considered were making mask-wearing mandatory “everywhere” and reducing density rates on public transport and in restaurants and bars. Updated at 2.58pm BST 1.50pm BST Italy hits record daily Covid-19 case since May Italy has registered more than 500 new coronavirus cases in the 24 hours to Saturday for a third consecutive day, reaching record daily figures since May. Most of those who have tested positive have been returning from Croatia, Spain, Greece and Malta. According to the health ministry, Italy registered 629 new coronavirus cases on Saturday. The health minister, Roberto Speranza, announced he had signed an ordinance requiring holidaymakers returning from Spain, Croatia, Malta and Greece to be tested for the coronavirus. He said: We need to maintain the utmost caution in order to defend what we have achieved so far. People returning from these countries will now be subject to swabs. For most of the summer, contact tracing and compliance with safety measures helped Italy maintain a stable, low rate of new Covid-19 infections, but one hot week in August may prove to be enough to undo all of the country’s previous successes. Updated at 5.31pm BST 12.52pm BST The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency use authorisation to Yale School of Public Health for its SalivaDirect Covid-19 diagnostic test, which uses a new method of processing saliva samples when testing for infection. The assistant secretary for health and Covid-19 testing coordinator, Admiral Brett Giroir, said: The SalivaDirect test for rapid detection of Sars-CoV-2 is yet another testing innovation game changer that will reduce the demand for scarce testing resources. Our current national expansion of Covid-19 testing is only possible because of FDA’s technical expertise and reduction of regulatory barriers, coupled with the private sector’s ability to innovate and their high motivation to answer complex challenges posed by this pandemic. FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn said: Providing this type of flexibility for processing saliva samples to test for Covid-19 infection is groundbreaking in terms of efficiency and avoiding shortages of crucial test components like reagents. Today’s authorisation is another example of the FDA working with test developers to bring the most innovative technology to market in an effort to ensure access to testing for all people in America. The FDA encourages test developers to work with the agency to create innovative, effective products to help address the Covid-19 pandemic and to increase capacity and efficiency in testing. According to the FDA, SalivaDirect does not require a swab or collection device. A saliva sample can be collected in any sterile container. This test is also said to be unique because it does not require a separate nucleic acid extraction step. This is the fifth test that the FDA has authorised that uses saliva as a sample for testing, eliminating the need for swabs. Updated at 2.39pm BST 12.38pm BST South Africa eases many lockdown rules South Africa has eased many of its lockdown restrictions after officials decided that the worst of the pandemic outbreak in the continent’s most developed country appeared to be over. With more than 580,000 confirmed infections so far, South Africa has been badly hit by the virus, despite one of the strictest and earliest lockdowns in the world. A total of 11,700 people have died, according to official figures, though research by government medical scientists suggests the true figure is several times higher. The president, Cyril Ramaphosa, gave the latest in a series of televised speeches on Saturday night, saying South Africa had “moved beyond the inflection point of the curve” of Covid-19 infections and announcing a sweeping removal of lockdown restrictions. Ramaphosa said the government would end a ban on alcohol and tobacco sales, allow restaurants and taverns to return to normal business subject to strict hygiene regulations, and remove a ban on travel between provinces. The Covid-19 crisis has done immense damage to an economy already in recession, destroying millions of jobs and causing huge hardship to many already disadvantaged South Africans. Ramaphosa said rates of new infections had fallen to an average of 5,000 a day, from a peak of 12,000 a day, and this, as well as a rise in recoveries, was “significantly reducing the pressure on our health facilities”. Officials in Gauteng, the most populous and wealthiest province, said last week that the peak of infections had been lower than anticipated but a second wave within three to four months was very probable. Ramaphosa, who remains broadly popular despite growing anger at reports suggesting systematic corruption within much of the ruling African National Congress party, cautioned that cases could surge if people fail to maintain vigilance and said that an almost total ban on international travel remained in place. The president’s pledge of decisive action against “some individuals who have sought to profit through corrupt means from this pandemic” received a sceptical reaction. Local media noted that in a 2,500-word speech, fewer than 100 words were devoted to a topic that has caused widespread outrage. The lifting of restrictions on alcohol will be a relief to the battered hospitality and drinks industries, though will further strain scarce and often poorly managed health resources. Public service and other unions have called for further massive stimulus to the economy. “The further easing of restrictions presents us with the greatest opportunity since the start of the pandemic to breathe life into our struggling economy,” the president said. Crime statistics released last week showed a steep decline in violent and other offences since the imposition of restrictions in late March. Updated at 2.38pm BST 12.35pm BST Spanish regions attempt to control virus by shutting bars by 1am as cases rise Spanish regions have begun implementing a slew of measures aimed at slowing down one of Europe’s highest rates of infection. Some two months after the country eased out of one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns, cases have soared across the country. The 14-day rate of new cases now sits at 116 per 100,000, according to European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, compared to 41 in France and 19 in the UK. Among the regions worst hit is Catalonia, where 1,044 new cases and 13 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours, according to the latest data from the regional health ministry. The sharp rise in cases prompted a recent announcement of new measures that will be put in place across Spain, including the shuttering of nightclubs and the closure of bars and restaurants by 1am. Smoking in public places will be banned when distancing is not possible. On Sunday these new measures came into effect in the northern wine-growing region of La Rioja and the southeastern region of Murcia. Other regions are expected to implement the measures in the coming days. In the Basque Country, where the 14-day rate of infection has climbed to 181 cases per 100,000, officials said they would declare a “health emergency” on Monday, which would allow them to restrict public gatherings and potentially confine areas with a high-risk of transmission. In hard-hit Madrid, officials announced that, starting Monday, they would carry out random tests on residents in some of the most at-risk areas of the city in hopes of better tracking asymptomatic cases. In the past two weeks, more than 10,800 people have tested positive in the Madrid region. The rapid spread of the virus in recent weeks has hit the country’s tourism industry, a vital sector that accounts for around 12% of Spain’s GDP. The latest blow came from Germany, whose residents rank among the largest groups of foreign tourists to Spain. After officials declared Spain, with the exemption of the Canary Islands, a coronavirus risk region – forcing returning travellers to take a test or quarantine on arrival – tour operator TUI said it was cancelling all German package holidays to Spain until Aug 24 and called on travellers already in the country to leave by the end of the week.

The 35-year-old took 10 hours and 40 minutes to complete her 35th swim, after setting off from Dover, Kent, on Saturday evening. She had been worried arriving in Calais would require her to self-isolate when she returned to the UK, after such rules were introduced on Saturday, leaving returning holidaymakers angry and incredulous. However, McCardel, 35, says UK and French coastguards clarified the situation as she spent only minutes on shore before swimming back out to her support boat for the return journey. “I’m in great spirits,” McCardel told the BBC afterwards. “I would like to have a little celebration this evening in England.” The female record of 43 Channel swims is held by Briton Alison Streeter.

This is reportedly the highest daily increase of the pandemic so far. Cases are continuing to rise steeply in many countries, while some others, notably Spain, are seeing infections rise again. Updated at 12.26pm BST 11.13am BST France set to announce new measures on masks and office working France is set to announce new measures within the next two weeks to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the workplace, the employment minister, Elisabeth Borne, said on Sunday after Paris and Marseille were declared “red zones” and the country recorded another new high in post-lockdown infections. Borne told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper that the government would consult with trades union next week on the measures, which are likely to include masks being made compulsory in collective spaces and meeting rooms with no natural ventilation, but not necessarily in individual offices. The minister also said home working should be the norm whenever possible in areas of the country where the virus is spreading actively, and that she would be consulting the public health authority on its recommendations for open-plan offices, including the installation of plexiglass screens between workers. The capital and the Bouches-du-Rhone département have both been classed as zones where the the coronavirus was “actively circulating”, an administrative measure that will allow government prefects to impose new restrictions as they deem necessary. Paris on Saturday expanded the parts of the city where masks are now obligatory in the open air, adding popular tourist areas such as the zone around the Eiffel tower and the Louvre to its list of busy shopping streets, open air markets and nightlife areas announced on Monday. Marseille, too, added more mandatory mask zones. It is now compulsory to cover your nose and mouth in public in the busiest areas of several French cities where physical distancing is difficult, including Nice, Rennes, Lille, La Rochelle, Lyon and Bordeaux, The French national health agency Santé publique France on Saturday reported 3,310 new infections in the previous 24 hours, another record since the country emerged from lockdown in mid-May. It said some, but not all, of the increase was due to massively increased testing, warning that the proportion of positive tests was increasing steadily. The Netherlands, meanwhile, added Paris and the Bouches-du-Rhone area, Brussels, Madrid and several Spanish regions to its orange advisory list, warning against all but essential travel and demanding that people returning go into quarantine for 14 days. Britain is also on the list because of the 14-day quarantine it has imposed on travellers from the Netherlands, but those returning from the UK are not required to quarantine when they get home. More than 650 people tested positive for coronavirus in the Netherlands in the 24 hours to Saturday, bringing the country’s latest weekly total to 4,508, more than 1,000 more than the previous week. Updated at 11.22am BST 10.33am BST Guidance urging travellers to avoid using public transport in Wales except for essential journeys is being scrapped from Monday. The Welsh government is telling people to act responsibly and avoid travelling at busy times where possible, as the number of coronavirus cases continues to fall. Face coverings on public transport remain compulsory except for people who are unable to wear one for medical reasons. Under measures announced last week, people in Wales will be able to see more of their families and friends from 22 August. Up to four households will be able to join together to form a single extended household and up to 30 people will also be able to join a meal indoors after a wedding, civil partnership or funeral if social distancing can be maintained. Essential travel only guidance was dropped in England on 17 July.

Australia’s federal health minister Greg Hunt is cautiously optimistic that a vaccine to conquer the coronavirus will be available next year. Hunt says the government is close to striking a deal which would permit the production of a vaccine in Australia. New Zealand has reported 13 new cases in Auckland, where authorities are dealing with a renewed outbreak after 102 days without a single case of community transmission. Opposition politicians have joined to call on PM Jacinda Ardern to delay the country’s election, scheduled for next month. South Korea reported 279 new cases, the most cases since early March.All but 12 were locally transmitted cases, mostly in Seoul and surrounding areas. The outbreak in the Xinjiang region of China appears to be waning, after authorities reported just four locally transmitted cases in the region. The rest of mainland China’s 19 cases were all imported. Britain’s health secretary Matt Hancock will announce this week that Public Health England (PHE) will be scrapped and replaced by a new body. Algeria started reopening its mosques, cafes, beaches and parks on Saturday for the first time in five months, gradually relaxing one of the world’s longer virus confinement periods. South African president Cyril Ramaphosa said on Saturday that all indications were that South Africa had reached the peak of Covid-19 infections, as he announced a sweeping removal of lockdown restrictions on the economy. Students in Saudi Arabian public schools will be educated via distance learning for the first seven weeks of the new school year. The French health ministry on Saturday reported 3,310 new coronavirus infections in France over the past 24 hours, setting a new post-lockdown high for the fourth day in a row. Ireland reported a “deeply concerning” 200 new Covid-19 cases arising from multiple clusters across the country on Saturday, the highest daily amount since the beginning of May. Turkey confirmed 1,256 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, the highest daily rise in infections since June, while Malta posted its highest ever daily-on-day rise, and Greek authorities have announced 230 new coronavirus cases on Friday, 27 from international arrivals. Updated at 8.05am BST 7.49am BST Northern Ireland’s chief scientific adviser has warned of the risks of complacency after Covid-19 cases in the region increased rapidly last week. Professor Ian Young said it was “inevitable” that there would be a significant increase in coronavirus cases if people stopped following social-distancing rules designed to prevent the spread of the disease. The reproduction rate of the virus is estimated at between 1.2 and 2.0, according to Northern Ireland’s Department of Health. There were 242 cases last week, with 74 positive tests announced on Friday alone – only 237 people tested positive during the whole of July. “We’ve just had probably two months with very little evidence of the virus,” said Young, who also sits on the UK government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. “No deaths for maybe 18, 20 days in a row; very few patients in hospitals. In that setting, it’s really hard for people to remember the importance of [social-distancing] behaviours. People relax, and they go back to what we still think of as normal. And if that happens, then it’s inevitable that we will see a further surge or significant increase.” Read the full report from the Guardian’s James Tapper and Henry McDonald here: Related: Rising R number casts cloud over Northern Ireland’s Covid success Updated at 7.55am BST 7.37am BST Parts of Malaysia’s Penang island are back under strict movement control orders, after more than 100 days dubbed “Covid-free bliss”, the Straits Times is reporting. It comes after a 58-year-old woman was diagnosed with the virus on Friday, and two new cases were reported on Saturday. According to the article, roadside hawkers can only serve takeaways, and while restaurants and coffee shops are allowed to have dine-in patrons they must strictly observe operating procedures. No form of crowding is allowed. Ms Nor Fazila Jaafar, 33, who works at a Malay food shop near the walk-up flats where the 58-year-old woman lives, said she was told on Saturday morning that they had to stop allowing dine-in. “Business was so bad. We cooked less, but we still only sold 30 per cent of the food all morning and afternoon,” she said. “We discovered that our rice comes from the sundry shop where the Covid-19 patient’s daughter works.” 7.25am BST More on the confusion in US schools, from Reuters in Nebraska, where a school district said on Saturday it had canceled classes after staff members tested positive for the new coronavirus, the latest state to see instruction disrupted after resuming in-person learning. Three staff members have the virus that causes Covid-19 and 24 more are in quarantine for exposure in the Broken Bow School District about 190 miles (300 km) west of Omaha, superintendent Darren Tobey said in a statement. Preschool and grade 6 to 12 classes are canceled until 24 August. President Donald Trump has made reopening schools a re-election campaign issue, threatening to pull federal funding if institutions fail to do so, but resumption of classroom teaching ran into trouble in several states this week. There is no national plan for school reopening, and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has urged districts to resume in-person classes when they consider it safe. That has led to a patchwork of policies, ranging from Republican Governor Pete Ricketts saying it was safe to resume in-person learning in Nebraska to Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham delaying classes until 8 September in New Mexico. 7.14am BST The Australian shadow government services minister, Bill Shorten, has taken aim at the profit-driven focus of the nation’s privatised aged care homes, while blaming the federal government for failing in its duty to oversee the system during the pandemic. The former Labor leader asked how privatised centres were able to “serve two masters” – profit and care – given the cost of properly caring for elderly people, particularly those with health issues such as dementia, was not insignificant. “This is the problem,” he told the ABC. “Looking after elderly people with diagnosis of dementia is not cheap. So if we want to make a profit, and you want to look after people, then you create faultlines in the system. “Covid-19 right across Australian society has revealed things which have been glossed over. And if you’re a worker in the system, and they’re doing the hard and the tough work, they have to work at multiple centres just to make a living.” Related: Bill Shorten lashes out at profit-driven aged care and Morrison government over Covid failings 7.05am BST Sydney Girls High School will be closed for cleaning on Monday after a student tested positive for Covid-19. Trial HSC exams scheduled for tomorrow will be postponed, the school said in a Facebook post. “The school will be non-operational tomorrow for the on-site attendance of staff and students to allow time for the school to complete contact tracing and have the school cleaned. All staff and students are asked to self-isolate while contact tracing occurs.” 6.54am BST In the US an Arizona public school district was forced to cancel its plans to reopen on Monday after more than 100 teachers and other staff members called in sick. “We have received an overwhelming response from staff indicating that they do not feel safe returning to classrooms with students,” Gregory Wyman, district superintendent, said in a statement on Friday. Now some activists in Arizona, which saw a high-profile teachers’ strike in 2018, said they hope teachers across America will adopt a similar strategy to keep educators safe, as some parents and politicians continue to push for schools in the US to reopen during the coronavirus pandemic. “I’d love to see a nationwide sickout,” Kelley Fisher, an Arizona kindergarten teacher who has led protests in the state, told Reuters on Friday. Related: Calls for nationwide sickout as Arizona school district cancels reopening 6.35am BST A Victoria police officer fired his gun this morning in Melbourne during an attempt to stop a driver breaching curfew. Police said the 64-year-old man pulled into a service station bay at Altona Meadows around 1.40am. The statement said the man ignored a direction to turn off his car, and drove towards police. “An approaching police officer had to take evasive action and discharged his firearm,” it said. The car was pursued for a short time before the man was arrested. The man was not injured, police said. He is currently under police guard in hospital due to a medical condition. 6.21am BST Have you tried to adopt an iso-pet? You’re not alone. Dog shelters across Australia have been emptied after a huge surge in demand for a rescued companion during the Covid-19 pandemic, forcing some desperate prospective dog owners to wait months. Matilda Bosely and Calla Wahlquist report that animals are leaving the shelter in half the time this year; the average stay in the RSPCA Victoria’s adoption shelters is down to less than four days. “Waiting for pets to be adopted can often be the biggest bottleneck in the system,” said Tegan McPherson, head of operations at RSPCA Victoria. “At the moment that’s certainly not proving to be the case.” Related: Dog gone: rescue pet shelters emptied by surge in demand during pandemic 6.04am BST The United States and South Korea will begin a scaled-back annual joint military exercises this week, Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said Sunday. But a spreading coronavirus outbreak has apparently forced the allies to scale back an already low-key training program mainly involving computer-simulated war scenarios. The two militaries had canceled their springtime drills following a Covid-19 outbreak in the southern city of Daegu and nearby towns that was stabilised by April. But South Korea is now dealing with a virus resurgence in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan region, home to half of the country’s 51 million people. There have been around 150 infections among US troops stationed in South Korea since February, which prompted Gyeonggi Province near Seoul last month to openly call for the cancellation of the August drills The 10-day drills from Tuesday could still irk North Korea, which portrays the allies training as invasion rehearsals and has threatened to abandon stalled nuclear talks if Washington persists with what it perceives as hostile policies toward Pyongyang. The North reacted to last years summertime drills by ramping up its short-range missile tests and unleashing verbal vitriol toward South Korea, which had lobbied hard to revive nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang. 5.42am BST From AAP: Four men were fined after trying to dodge border restrictions by sailing a houseboat from NSW to Cairns. The four were intercepted aboard the 14-metre catamaran in Gold Coast waters on Friday after leaving Coffs Harbour on Wednesday. They were allegedly trying to make the more than 2000km journey to return to their homes and are currently undergoing hotel quarantine at their own expense. 5.21am BST New Zealand’s deputy prime minister Winston Peters has sided with the opposition to ask Jacinda Ardern to postpone the country’s election because of the Auckland outbreak. Ardern is due to announce her decision at 10am tomorrow on whether she will delay the election scheduled for 19 September. On Sunday afternoon, Peters revealed he wrote to Ardern on Friday, saying he held “real concerns about the state of preparedness of the Electoral Commission”. “Our health response must come first and politics second. That remains our view as the case numbers rise each day,” Peters said. He also said that a 19 September election would give candidates only about six days to campaign, and there was no ability to conduct a free and fair election on the short timeline. “New Zealand First believes we risk undermining the legitimacy of the election result, creating an awful precedent which could be abused by the Prime Minister’s successors.” Together, the opposition National party and Ms Ardern’s coalition partners New Zealand First, amounts to a parliamentary majority, which could force Ms Ardern’s hand. 5.03am BST AAP: The AFL has apologised to Western Australia’s premier after Sydney player Elijah Taylor was banned for the rest of the season for breaching the state’s quarantine rules. Taylor’s partner entered the Swans’ Covid-19 hub accommodation in Perth when she was not authorised to do so. The Swans have been fined $50,000 for the breach, with $25,000 suspended and $25,000 included in their 2021 soft cap. WA Police are continuing to investigate the breach and Premier Mark McGowan says both Taylor and his partner could face charges. “it’s very disappointing,” he said on Sunday. “The AFL gave us every assurance this wouldn’t happen. The Swans have let us down, the AFL has let us down. We’re disappointed in both organisations. “I received an apology from the AFL this morning. I appreciate that but ... they promised us this wouldn’t happen and they let us down.” A crowd attendance of 6,464 is displayed during round 12 AFL match between the Sydney Swans and the GWS Giants at Optus Stadium, Perth, Thursday, August 13, 2020. Photograph: Richard Wainwright/AAP WA Police have notified Sydney that 19-year-old Taylor can continue his quarantine with the team, while his partner will also be required to quarantine for 14 days. Both the AFL and the Swans have said there are no excuses for the breach. Mr McGowan said he remained open to the state hosting the grand final if teams complied with quarantine requirements. But he said he had no intention of WA bidding to host the showcase event, which is increasingly likely to be played in Brisbane. 4.49am BST All but one of New Zealand’s 13 new cases reported in the last 24 hours were from community transmission and appeared to be linked to a cluster in Auckland where the most recent outbreak started, said Ashley Bloomfield, the New Zealand director general of Health, today. The 13th was a traveller who returned from abroad and was in managed quarantine. New Zealand is battling its second outbreak of infections and a lockdown is in place over Auckland. Eleanor Ainge-Roy has written this feature on Auckland’s lockdown after 102 days of the country being Covid-free. This is exactly the type of outbreak we were worried about, and in fact it’s exactly what happened,” said Professor Shaun Hendy, who works modelling the progression of the disease for the government. “We’ve been looking at different ways it [coronavirus] could come back and they’re all low-likelihood ways, but this was very much one of the scenarios we considered. For a while we were hoping it was a drill.” Related: 'Go hard, go early' – now New Zealand goes back to the drawing board 4.32am BST Australian health minister Greg Hunt believes Victoria is seeing the early signs of flattening the curve. Hunt said on the best medical advice he had received, Victoria is on a path to progressive reduction. “There is a long way to go. There will be good days, there will be bad days. There will be days when the numbers are up and days when the numbers are down,” he told Sky News’ Sunday Agenda program. “But the signs now are that the trend is of progressive reduction.” He said the most important thing now is contact tracing to make sure each new case in Victoria is followed up. But Australian Medical Association president Omar Khorshid believes there are just too many people with the virus for contact tracers to keep up. “Once you get hundreds and hundreds of cases a day, you’ve then got to find 10 to 20 to 50 to 100 people per case,” Khorshid told the Nine Network’s Weekend Today program. “It’s just impossible for contact tracers, and it’s why it’s so important that the general lockdowns are in place.” Updated at 4.59am BST 4.19am BST South Korea on Sunday reported 279 cases of the new coronavirus, the most cases since early March, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. Out those, 267 were locally transmitted cases, mostly in Seoul and surrounding areas. The new cases bring the country’s tally to 15,318 infections, and 305 deaths, as of Saturday midnight. 3.49am BST Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk remains unapologetic regarding the hard border closures with the state’s southern neighbours, crediting the shutdown with allowing Queensland’s economy to reopen. “Until there is a vaccine, life will not return to normal,” she told reporters on Sunday. “[But] We are able to have life in a semi-normal fashion, families are out enjoying this long weekend. We’ve got people able to go to work and children able to go to school.” Queensland’s hospitality and tourism businesses have enjoyed a much-needed revenue boost over the long weekend in the state’s south-east following another day of no coronavirus infections. The state recorded no new infections on Sunday and just nine active cases, including two crew members on a cargo ship off the Queensland coast who remain in hospital after testing positive to the virus on Friday. If community transmissions remain low Palaszczuk said some restrictions impacting the tourism sector could be relaxed by September. Updated at 4.26am BST 3.35am BST One dead in New South Wales A man has died of Covid-19 in New South Wales. The death of the man, who was in his 80s, takes the state’s death toll to 54 and the national toll to 396. Updated information: Five new cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed in the 24 hours to 8pm last night, bringing the total number of cases in NSW to 3,761. NSW Health sadly reports the death of a man in his 80s who had COVID-19. pic.twitter.com/gOPJOACJtj — NSW Health (@NSWHealth) August 16, 2020 The health department has also provided some more details on the five new cases reported in the state. Three are linked to the Tangara School for Girls cluster. They are all close contacts of previous cases. One, a man in his 40s from western Sydney, is locally acquired and still under investigation. The other is a close contact of this person. Previous cases have attended the below venues. Anyone who attended these venues at the following dates and times are considered to be casual contacts, and should monitor for symptoms and immediately get tested and isolate if symptoms occur, however mild: Crust Pizza, Concord on Thursday 6 August between 4pm and 8pm or Friday 7 August between 5pm and 9pm. Den Sushi Rose Bay on Saturday 8 August between 7:15pm and 8:45pm. Café Perons Double Bay on Saturday 8 August between 1pm and 2pm. Horderns Restaurant at Milton Park Country House Hotel and Spa, Bowral on Sunday 2 August between 7:45pm and 9:15pm. Updated at 3.39am BST 3.24am BST A quick summary at the end of the Andrews press conference giving an update of the last 24-hour reporting period. The state of emergency has been extended until 13 September. 16 people have died including one female and two males in their 70s, two females and four males in their 80s, and four females and three males in their 90s. There are 279 new cases. 7,671 total active cases, including 158 in Geelong, 49 in Bendigo, 27 in Ballarat, 82 in disability accommodation. Amid fears of looming virus crisis in disability care, Andrews wants federal involvement in the rapid response. The virus reproduction rate has dropped to about 0.86. Police have given out an additional 243 fines for breaching restrictions. “This is a tough year and we’re going to get through this, all of us,” says Andrews. “We’re tough people ... and we’re all this together.” Updated at 3.40am BST 3.18am BST New Zealand: 13 new cases New Zealand on Sunday reported 13 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus for the last 24 hours, as the country’s first outbreak in months continues to grow. All but one of the new cases were community transmissions and appeared to be linked to a cluster in Auckland where the most recent outbreak started, the director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, told a media briefing in Wellington. The 13th infected person was a traveller returning from abroad and in a managed quarantine. The new cases bring the number of active cases in New Zealand to 69. Since the start of the year, the country has recorded 1,271 cases, Bloomfield said. Updated at 3.39am BST 3.12am BST On improving communication with families of people in aged care, Andrews says he and the prime minister have talked about it, and how staff can balance the work of caring and the extra stuff like helping a resident with an iPad to contact their family on Zoom. “Anything more we can do we will, I know it’s a deeply distressing [time] for families.” “Getting information to people quickly, I can appreciate that’s something families need and we’re all committed to getting that done.” 3.02am BST “We are going to see further chains of transmission, but the trend is good,” says Sutton. He says the reproduction rate is about 0.86 and the last time he looked at it, it was 0.97. Two key quotes here on managing expectations for the short to mid term: Sutton: “Spain had kids not able to leave home for six weeks, they had people exercising only within 150 metres of their home..they still had months of ongoing transmission. It doesn’t turn off overnight.” Andrews: “Even when this second wave is over, we will still see cases...The notion of completely extinguishing it and never seeing it again, I think that would be an unlikely outcome.” Updated at 3.09am BST 2.59am BST Victoria police have given out 243 fines in the past 24 hours, including 84 for breaching curfew. About 30 apiece were for not wearing masks or being caught at a vehicle checkpoint, including a Torquay man driving 140km away from his home, allegedly looking for better surf. Brett Sutton is asked about the effect of Victoria police releasing details every day, and if this is “shaming”. “I don’t think the police intend to shame anyone,” says Sutton, , but people do need to be “called out” for some breaches. “I think it’s overwhelmingly the case that people are doing the right thing.” Updated at 3.01am BST 2.49am BST Andrews says the Victorian government wants federal involvement in rapid response within disability accommodation. He said the state has set up its own response team, despite the fact many facilities are federally funded and regulated. “No [they are not involved], but I want them to be.” Feds pointing out NDIA announced additional support to providers, including workforce support, through a panel of four major providers.

He said there were 158 active cases in Geelong, 49 in Bendigo, and 27 in Ballarat. “If there is one ask which is a takeaway from today’s briefing, it’s if people in those regional cities … can come forward and get tested. That is the really important part of us keeping the numbers in regional Victoria low.” 2.36am BST Andrews is noting there are still outbreaks today but far fewer than a few weeks ago when the state was “at a tipping point”. He’s cautiously optimistic that the measures are working and that the state is on track to wind back from stage four restrictions in six weeks. 2.27am BST Victorian state of emergency extended by four weeks Victorian premier Dan Andrews has been addressing the press. We earlier posted that 16 people have died and 279 new cases have been reported. Andrews has confirmed that 11 of those cases are in aged care. Among the disability accommodation population there are 81 active cases (down by eight from yesterday), including 61 staff cases and 20 residents, across 53 sites. “This is a significant challenge for us, but I want every staff member, resident and family connected to these settings to understand ... we are well aware of the risks and challenges here and we are well and truly committed to doing everything we can to keep you and your loved ones safe.” Andrews also announces the state of emergency will be extended another four weeks, to 13 September. “While these numbers are positive ... I don’t want anyone to think we can back off on this,” he says. Updated at 3.02am BST 2.20am BST Five new cases in New South Wales In Australia the state of New South Wales has reported five new cases in the 24 hours to 8pm last night. None are in hotel quarantine. This post has been edited to remove case information from Friday 14 August which was incorrectly attributed to Saturday 15 August. Updated at 2.34am BST 2.08am BST Mainland China has reported 19 new cases of the virus, including 15 imported, and four locally transmitted cases - all in Xinjiang. Nearby Hong Kong is working to get a handle on its long-running latest (and worst) outbreak. City health authorities confirmed 46 new cases and two deaths on Saturday. Of the new cases 39 were locally transmitted and 2 of them had no know source. Since early July Hong Kong has been battling a renewed wave of the virus with a high rate of community transmission. Strict social measures are in place, and authorities are preparing to launch mass testing. 1.58am BST It’s a better story in Queensland where there are no new cases of the virus to report. The state, which has introduced hard borders with other states, has nine active cases. In total 1,091 people have contracted Covid-19 during the pandemic, six of them fatally. Sunday, 16 August – coronavirus cases in Queensland: • 0 new confirmed cases • 9 active cases • 1,091 total confirmed cases • 725,394 tests conducted Sadly, six Queenslanders with COVID-19 have died. 1,079 patients have recovered.#COVID19Aus pic.twitter.com/sF0LG3Iac2 — Annastacia Palaszczuk (@AnnastaciaMP) August 16, 2020 1.50am BST Victorian premier Daniel Andrews has said he will not rule out taking over more coronavirus-ridden private aged care facilities struggling to provide adequate care. It comes after an alarming report from Guardian Australia yesterday, with disturbing new images showed ants crawling from a wound on the leg of a 95-year-old Kalyna Aged Care resident in Delahey. Staff brought in to run the nursing home reported residents hadn’t received food or water for 18 hours and finding faeces on the floor. After sending in public hospital nurses to Glenlyn Aged Care in Fitzroy, Florence Aged Care in Altona North and Kalyna Aged Care, the premier on Saturday said the government was ready to take over more sites if needed. “I can’t rule out that we will add to that list,” he told reporters in Melbourne. “If we are asked to step in then that is exactly what we do. “That’s all about making sure residents get the best care.” Andrews made a point of highlighting that of 2041 active cases in Victorian aged care settings, 2036 cases were linked to the private system and just five to the public sector. This morning on the ABC’s Insiders program, federal Labor frontbencher Bill Shorten said he believes the faultlines seen in aged care during the coronavirus pandemic stem from centres trying to make a profit, while caring for older people is not cheap. “We need to put people before profit,” he said. .@Raf_Epstein is still hearing disturbing things through talkback about aged care. \"John called in from Craigieburn. His wife works in aged care... She got an email saying you must come to work. If you don't come to work, you've got to produce a medical certificate.\" #auspol pic.twitter.com/yrStjGbyji — Insiders ABC (@InsidersABC) August 15, 2020 The total number of Covid-19 deaths associated with the Victorian aged care sector is 184, which is 63 per cent of a total 293 Victorian deaths. Andrews’s emphasis on the public-private breakdown of cases followed Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s refusal on Friday to take ultimate blame for failures in the federally-regulated sector. Morrison speaking on 2GB radio on Saturday reiterated his view that while there had been failings, aged care outbreaks in Victoria would not exist without rampant community transmission. Victoria recorded 303 new cases on Saturday - the second-lowest daily figure in August - and four deaths. Updated at 1.55am BST 1.28am BST Victoria: 279 new cases, 16 dead The Australian state of Victoria has reported 279 new cases of the virus in the last 24 hours, and another 16 fatalities.

According to a report in Nine newspapers this morning, federal MPs are starting to question it. The Australian Border Force website lists the following reasons someone can give to apply for an exit permit. your travel is as part of the response to the Covid-19 outbreak, including the provision of aid your travel is essential for the conduct of critical industries and business (including export and import industries) you are travelling to receive urgent medical treatment that is not available in Australia you are travelling on urgent and unavoidable personal business you are travelling on compassionate or humanitarian grounds your travel is in the national interest. The ABF said just 22,640 people had been given permission to leave, between late March and the end of June, out of 91,950 applications. “It puts us on par with North Korea, in terms of, are we now a prison state, that unless you can justify yourself to the department, you cannot leave the country?” said independent MP Zali Steggall, who added she’d been inundated with calls from constituents. “This is an extreme measure for extreme times but it cannot be something we contemplate keeping in place for the long term,” Liberal MP Dave Sharma said. Australia’s border restrictions to control the spread of the virus are among the toughest in the world. Like some other nations it has banned the entry of anyone except citizens and permanent residents, who are struggling to get flights because of caps on international arrivals. Arrivals must also undergo compulsory 14 days quarantine on arrival, and there are also internal state border closures and restrictions. Updated at 1.17am BST 12.53am BST From Reuters in Trinidad and Tobago, where the government are about to bring in tougher anti-virus measures after the number of infections increased this month. The Caribbean nation registered a jump in Covid-19 cases in August after a gradual rise in July, and has now recorded 474 cases and ten fatalities. Two of the deaths were reported on Friday. “Given how the virus has been behaving in other populations worldwide... we expect that we will be able to control the level of infection in a situation where our parallel (health) system would be able to cope,” Prime Minister Keith Rowley told reporters. The new measures, which will go into effect on Monday and last 28 days, include the closure of beaches and places of worship, as well as a ban on dining at restaurants and bars. No more than five people will be able to gather at a time, and schools will no longer re-open in September as planned. As well, the Attorney General will consider legislation to make face masks mandatory. “The time for persuasion has now passed and we will take such action,” Rowley said 12.37am BST AAP: Australia’s federal health minister Greg Hunt is cautiously optimistic that a vaccine to conquer the coronavirus will be available next year. Hunt says the government is close to striking a deal which would permit the production of a vaccine in Australia, but was unable to provide the names of the companies involved due to contractual reasons. “We are in advanced negotiations with a range of different companies with regards to a vaccine,” Hunt told Sky News’ Sunday Agenda. “I am now on the basis of our best advice genuinely more optimistic, I think the work is moving closer to a vaccine.’ He said very significant progress is being made around the world to produce a vaccine. “All our advice has been 2021 is the most likely anything that occur,” he said. “Before then, then that would be an outstanding result, not just for Australia but for the world.” The world is moving closer to a COVID-19 vaccine which could be in place by 2021, according to Health Minister @GregHuntMP.https://t.co/YWP1QACqT8 — Sky News Australia (@SkyNewsAust) August 15, 2020 Updated at 12.44am BST 12.34am BST Hello and welcome to our continuing coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. This is Helen Davidson in Sydney here to take you through the next few hours. First, a look at the most recent developments: Britain’s health secretary Matt Hancock will announce this week that Public Health England (PHE) will be scrapped and replaced by a new body. The US Food and Drug Administration on Saturday granted emergency use authorisation for Yale School of Public Health’s saliva test to detect Covid-19, after a trial on National Basketball Association players and staff. Algeria started reopening its mosques, cafes, beaches and parks on Saturday for the first time in five months, gradually relaxing one of the world’s longer virus confinement periods. Greek authorities have announced 230 new coronavirus cases over the past day, 27 from international arrivals. South African president Cyril Ramaphosa said on Saturday that all indications were that South Africa had reached the peak of Covid-19 infections, as he announced a sweeping removal of lockdown restrictions on the economy. Students in Saudi Arabian public schools will be educated via distance learning for the first seven weeks of the new school year. Malta posted its highest ever daily-on-day rise in coronavirus infections. Turkey confirmed 1,256 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, the highest daily rise in infections since June. The French health ministry on Saturday reported 3,310 new coronavirus infections in France over the past 24 hours, setting a new post-lockdown high for the fourth day in a row and taking the country’s cumulative cases to 215,521.

What can Europe learn?","body":"Ordinarily, having an aperitivo in Venice’s St Mark’s Square would cost a small fortune. Not on 3 March, when bar owners offered a free drink for each one purchased in an attempt to attract custom as the city emptied out amid Italy’s developing coronavirus outbreak. The offer was intended to last a month. In Rome, restaurant touts jokingly invited people to try a “carbonaravirus” as the tourists left in the capital went along with the relaxed vibe, choosing to carry on with their holiday rather than go home. That was during the first week of March. Business owners could hardly be blamed for worrying about the impact of coronavirus on their livelihoods, especially when leaders were giving confusing messages. On 27 February, four days after 11 towns in the north were quarantined and when 17 people had died of the virus and 650 were infected, Nicola Zingaretti, the leader of the governing Democratic party, travelled to Milan, whose wider Lombardy region is the centre of the outbreak, for an aperitif with a group of students. “We must not change our habits,” he wrote in a post on social media. “Our economy is stronger than fear: let’s go out for an aperitivo, a coffee or to eat a pizza.” On the same day, Beppe Sala, the mayor of Milan, shared a video with the slogan “Milan does not stop.” The clip contained images of people hugging each other, eating in restaurants, walking in parks and waiting at train stations. Nine days after his trip to the city, by which time the death toll had risen to 233 and confirmed cases 5,883, Zingaretti announced he was suffering from the virus. As Boris Johnson gave his most explicit warning yet on Sunday that the UK might face an Italian-style lockdown, Italy’s experience – particularly the way people went about their business in the early days of the crisis –could serve as a warning to other European countries that appear to be following a similar infection trajectory. Giuseppe Pantaleo, a social psychologist at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan, said: “At the beginning people were not really believing what was happening so politicians like Zingaretti and others just wanted to reassure the population. He went to Milan to demonstrate some forms of social behaviour were still safe and that the government was working towards a solution and so on, but he of course underestimated the risk.” Medics also clashed, with some taking the virus seriously and others writing it off as only a bit more serious than flu. As the virus spread, the public turned to humour, with memes and videos shared across social media, including one of an Italian grandmother giving advice about hand-washing. Another featured mobsters hatching a plan to smuggle Amuchina, the Italian-made hand sanitiser enjoying a boom in sales, instead of cocaine. “Either within their social groups or on social media, people reacted with jokes and irony,” said Pantaleo. “Laughing is a very common reaction that people have when they’re confronted with the idea of death. But of course, in those early days nobody saw it as a serious possibility.” Italians exercise on their balconies in Rome. Photograph: Remo Casilli/Reuters Kissing on the cheek and hugging were banned, and social distancing advised. However, in another foreshadowing of the UK’s situation, people were still out and about, frequenting bars, restaurants, parks and beaches. With no school or university, teenagers and students took the opportunity to socialise more with friends. For the most part, life carried on as normal until an abrupt change on 8 March, when deaths from Covid-19 leapt by more than 50%. The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, ordered the whole of Lombardy and 14 other provinces across other badly affected northern regions to be quarantined. The news of the quarantine was leaked to the Italian press a few hours before an official announcement, provoking thousands of people of southern origin to flee home from the north. A national lockdown came on 10 March but the measures only really started to hit home a couple of days later, when bars, restaurants and other non-essential shops were closed across the country. Conte’s tone became clearer and more direct but also more humbling. He thanked Italians for the “great sacrifices” they were making for the common good, while repeating his call for people to stay at home. Sara Raginelli, a psychologist in Ancona, in the Marche region, said: “The moment the politics changed and started to speak in a more clear and direct way, people’s behaviour also changed and people developed more of an attitude of awareness. “The moment Italians were told to stay at home and rigid containment measures were introduced, the majority of the population complied.” Still, as the lockdown set in, over the course of a week police charged more than 40,000 citizens for flouting the quarantine rules, which stipulate that people can venture out only if strictly necessary, such as for work, health-related reasons or to go to the supermarket. Police have increased checks in recent days and troops are patrolling streets in Naples and Sicily. Perhaps misunderstanding the rules, people took the opportunity to go jogging or walk in the park, leading to all parks being closed on Saturday. People can still exercise outside as long as they stay close to home. After another steep rise in the death toll on Saturday night to 4,825, Conte made another dramatic speech while announcing all businesses, apart from those supplying essential goods and services, must close. “It is the most difficult crisis of our postwar period,” he said. A lone pedestrian in Turin. Citizens can venture out only if strictly necessary. Photograph: Alessandro Di Marco/EPA The latest move is expected to drill home the severity of the virus even more. Pantaleo said: “Now that we are really in touch with the possibility of dying – either ourselves, a family member or friend, we take it seriously and are increasingly motivated to behave in accordance with the social norms. “So the example set by institutions is very important because if the norms are clear and group leaders stick to them, then we will follow. We will also see our self-esteem increase as we act together towards a common goal, contributing even by keeping as calm as possible at home.”","Id":"world/2020/mar/23/a-warning-to-europe-italy-struggle-to-convince-citizens-of-coronavirus-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Italy struggled to convince citizens of coronavirus crisis.

Former Tottenham midfielder Eriksen collapsed during Denmark’s match with Finland at the European Championship earlier this month and the 29-year-old only survived after being resuscitated on the pitch. It led to renewed calls for defibrillators to be made more accessible, which have resulted in the Premier League working in partnership with the Football Foundation and Football Association to make the life-saving devices available to sites across the UK over the next few months. Here’s the statement: The Premier League has today announced it will fund the provision of Automated External Defibrillators (AED) at thousands of grassroots football clubs and facilities, aimed at helping save the life of someone experiencing a sudden cardiac arrest,” a statement read. Working in partnership with the Football Foundation and The Football Association, the first phase of the Premier League Defibrillator Fund rollout will have AEDs provided to Football Foundation funded facilities which currently are without a life-saving device onsite. In the second phase, grassroots clubs that own their facilities will be able to apply for funding for a defibrillator. Together more than 2,000 sites will benefit from this investment, with the first 1,000 units delivered in time for the start of the 2021-22 season and the second batch expected in September. 4.40pm BST Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma may not have conceded in his last 874 minutes of action for the national team but is he any good at saving penalties?

Photograph: UEFA/Getty Images It’s another big challenge. We know Denmark are a very good team, very well organised and have some very good players. So they won’t be underestimated by us. We’ll be ready to go come kick-off and put in a big performance. We’re always the underdogs and used to that tag. It doesn’t make a difference to us. He’s technically correct.

Mount is in self-isolation after coming into contact with Scotland’s Billy Gilmour after the Group D clash last week. Rice said (and I’m guessing with a slight smile): “I’m a lost soul. A few of the lads came up to me and said I look lost. He has got a couple of days until he comes out, I have spoken to him and he has tested negative.” 3.47pm BST Let’s drill down deeper and check the penalty-saving records of Saturday’s two goalkeepers.

Photograph: Jamie Squire - FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images Gulp if you’re a Wales fan. Schmeichel’s save percentage is just under 25% while Ward’s is 14%. On the plus side Ward saved a penalty from Karim Benzema in the recent friendly against France so that is fresh in the memory. 3.37pm BST Picture the scene... it’s finished 1-1 after extra-time between Wales and Denmark and this bad boy’s going to penalties. Can some cold, hard facts quell those Welsh nerves which are running amok as Robert Page scribbles down his five penalty takers? Are Denmark useless at spot-kicks, maybe? Past evidence is mixed although the Danes did lose their last shootout when some of this current squad were involved. Denmark’s shoot-out record is W2 L2 4-5 v Spain, 1984 UEFA European Championship semi-final 5-4 v Netherlands, Euro ‘92 semi-final 4-2 v Mexico, 1995 FIFA Confederations Cup group stage 2-3 v Croatia, 2018 FIFA World Cup round of 16 Denmark lose to Croatia on penalties at the 2018 World Cup.

Although he struck the post early on in England’s opener against Croatia, the Manchester City man was substituted in that game and also hooked in the dire 0-0 draw with Scotland. With a yellow card hanging over him, Foden was left out of the 23-man squad against the Czech Republic. Phil Foden during a training session at St George’s Park on Friday. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA Will Phil light up the tournament in the knockout phase? Here is his assessment so far: To be honest, I expect a lot more from myself but I’m not going to be too harsh. I didn’t really get involved in the games as much I would have liked. Hopefully, I can get the opportunity to play again and show what I am about. I feel like I’ve still got so much more to show this tournament. Like I’ve done for my club, I’ve been scoring a lot of goals and I just want to continue that form into the national team. And I believe that, hopefully in the next game, I can start getting involved in the goals. Looking ahead to the Germany game, he’s confident that England can take it up a notch. I’m hoping, come the Germany game, we can just express ourselves. With the attackers we’ve got we can really hurt them, so hopefully we turn up. We’re as good as anyone on our day. Obviously, I wasn’t born when all of this rivalry was going on (with Germany). We’re a new team now and we want to create our own history. You can’t think too much about what’s happened in the past. We’re just going to focus on the game and create our own future. 3.10pm BST Well, if Alexis Petridis gives Ed Sheeran’s new single four stars out of five, who am I to argue?

Matthew Howarth, Wales reporter: “Wales have already achieved their goal for the tournament by qualifying from a difficult group, but there is no reason why their Euro adventure cannot continue deep into the knockout stage. Denmark blew Russia away in the second half in Copenhagen but Rob Page’s side, who defended for their lives in Rome to clinch their last-16 spot, are an altogether different proposition. This has all the ingredients to be one of the ties of the round.” Sture Sandø, Denmark reporter: “This tournament started all wrong for Denmark but they managed to scramble through, and now they are where they expected to be: in the knockout stage. Looking at the other match-ups, Denmark cannot be too unhappy about their opponents but they need to show great respect for Wales. The Russia game was great, scoring four goals, but the team still lack a goal-getter. How many of Monday’s goals can they recreate?” Wales manager Robert Page during a team training session. Photograph: Andrew Medichini/AP Robert Page, Wales manager: “We’re all ambitious and we want to go as far as we can, but we’re not naive going into this game. We’ve watched Denmark play in their most recent game and you can’t be anything other than impressed by what they’re doing.

In their 4-1 win against Russia, Mikkel Damsgaard became Denmark’s youngest ever goalscorer at a major tournament (20y 353d). The striker has been involved in six goals in his five appearances in all competitions for the Danes (3 goals, 3 assists).

Speaking to Antonio as part of The Shop Talk series sponsored by the Professional Footballers’ Association, Mings said: “When you filter (your social media accounts) better, and you stop people being able to see it as much, trolls will get bored – they just want to trigger you.” Antonio suggested that an attempt to post certain words should trigger an alert which leads to social media companies immediately blocking the account in question. “Why can you not have words that literally send an alert straight to Instagram, so you can’t physically type that word into the platform?” he asked. “As soon as it comes up, it sends an alert and then accounts get blocked instantly.

Fourteen spot-kicks were given in the 36 group games, compared to seven at the same stage of Euro 2016. Before the VAR project there were many, many fouls in the penalty area missed by the referees. Now, it’s impossible to miss these fouls. We know very well the strength but also the limits of the project. VAR is a Formula One project, and for this Formula One project we need top, expert pilots. We need to find the correct balance in the line of intervention, because our target is to keep football like it is. It’s not acceptable to study all the minor pushing or pulling, or minor contacts and marginal contacts independently. The laws of the game are clear. We want the minimum interference for the maximum benefit and we want to intervene (only) for clear and obvious mistake.

History says they’ll get it done in 90 minutes. None of the 10 previous meetings between Wales and Denmark in all competitions have finished level, with Wales winning four to Denmark’s six. This is the first meeting between the sides since November 2018, with Denmark winning 2-1 in a Nations League match. Denmark recorded 59 shots in the group stages, with their average of 19.7 shots-per-game their highest on record in a major tournament (Euros and World Cup). Having converted just one of their first 44 shots in this tournament (2%), Denmark scored with four of their last 15 shots against Russia last time out (27%). Wales have had a combined 97 shot attempts at Euro 2016 and Euro 2020, with 49 of those coming from Gareth Bale (33) and Aaron Ramsey (16), equating to just over half of their total efforts at goal.

(From Reuters): UEFA did not give details of the incidents at the match, which was played in Munich on Wednesday. Before kickoff, a protester waving a rainbow flag had invaded the pitch, while fans outside and inside the stadium carried similar banners to show their support for LGBTQ rights. This came after UEFA refused a request from Munich’s mayor for the stadium to be lit in rainbow colours for the game in protest at an anti-LGBTQ law in Hungary. Mayor Dieter Reiter wanted to highlight legislation in Hungary banning school materials deemed to promote homosexuality and gender change and restricting the media from showing such content in programmes accessible to minors.

It’s as if those in the squad who watched the second half of the Czech game haven’t suffered enough. “He did a little sing-song while we were eating food,” Kalvin Phillips told BBC Radio 5 Live. But I’m intrigued by the Leeds midfielder’s response when asked if Ed performed ‘Three Lions’. “To be honest he started playing it and then after 30 seconds he stopped.” What does that mean? Why? Booed off? I want to know more. Obviously, this brings to mind the classic tale from Paul Lake’s book about another well-known Ed. A typically low key Mel Machin expressed caution and warned us against complacency, but then a mischievous grin played across his face as he informed us that he’d arranged for one of his pals to give us a quick motivational pep talk. What do we need this for? We’re 3-0 up, for Chrissakes’ I remember thinking, wondering which former colleague of the gaffer’s was going to get wheeled out. From the direction of Roy Bailey’s physio room toddled Eddie Large, the Mancunian funny man and City fanatic who, in those days was a huge primetime TV star with his weekly sidekick ‘supersonic’ Syd Little. What followed was the most surreal half-time team talk I’ve ever experienced. Eddie wearing a shiny grey showbiz suit with rolled up sleeves, proceeded to dole out individual advice to each of the players using his well known repetoire of celebrity impersonations. So Deputy Dawg ordered me to keep tight in defence; Frank Carson told Nelly to use the width and pace of Whitey; Cliff Richard advised Trevor Morley to shoot on sight; Harold Wilson told Bob Brightwell to keep it simple and Benny from Crossroads told Andy Dibble to stay awake.

It was great to see him. That helped a lot of the guys I think just to see him and erase the last image we had of him on the pitch. To see him in real life and to see that he was okay...it was really important. 11.02am BST More on referees, per the Associated Press. Well done, refs, from the chief refs. UEFA has given its referees and match officials high marks for their overall performance at the European Championship. Trends cited by UEFA chief refereeing officer Roberto Rosetti include nearly 2.5 minutes more active playing time per game, fewer fouls awarded and fewer yellow cards shown. UEFA believes the first European Championship using video review means all tight offside decisions were correctly made and more penalties were correctly given. Rosetti says offside “is not any more an issue for us.” He praises the players’ good behavior and attitude for the average of only 22.4 fouls in the 36-game group stage. That raised the average active playing time to 58 minutes, 51 seconds compared to 56:30 at Euro 2016. 10.48am BST Àlvaro Morata has been speaking about the social media abuse he has been receiving for his performances for Spain during Euro 2012. He missed a penalty against Slovakia during a 5-0 win. Per Reuters, taken from an interview with Spanish radio station Cadena Cope. I would like people to put themselves in my shoes and think what it’s like to get threats towards my family, people saying ‘I hope your children die’. I’ve had to leave my phone outside my room. My wife and children have come to the stadium in Seville with Morata on the back of their shirts and people have been shouting at them. It’s complicated. I understand people booing me for missing chances but there’s a limit. Morata said he had a sleepless night after missing the penalty against Slovakia, which set up a last-16 tie with Croatia, but does not regret taking the spot-kick. He said that despite the abuse and criticism he has faced he feels a huge level of support from his team mates, adding former Spain great Iker Casillas had called him to lift his spirits. I’m proud of the fact I picked up the ball (to take the penalty) after people booed me in the warm up. A few years ago I would have been devastated but I’m really motivated. Whoever thinks the opposite doesn’t know me. It’s hard to find a group like this especially in the difficult times. After a week like this I’ve been aware of how everyone looks at me but I look in their eyes and see they are supporting me. 10.39am BST A story from PA Media, and deserved praise for Wythenshawe’s finest referee and Altrincham fan. English official Anthony Taylor has been praised for his “perfect” handling of Christian Eriksen’s cardiac arrest during the Denmark v Finland match by UEFA’s referees chief. Taylor immediately recognised the seriousness of the situation and signalled for medics to come on within seconds. His quick thinking, along with that of Denmark captain Simon Kjaer, has been widely praised, and UEFA chief refereeing officer Roberto Rosetti said on Friday: “Everyone recognised that Anthony was perfect. He managed this difficult moment in a great way. We are proud about his behaviour, we are proud about his cold blood. “We recommended to the referees that safety is first, it is the most important target for us. ‘The referees must, and they are ready, to stop the match immediately in these situations.

Another rest day at the Euros, but no rest here, as we ready ourselves for four nights of red-hot soccer that may or may not includes teams playing for penalties. And will almost certainly include tears before bedtime.

After all, we have under five days left to build up to England v Germany, and overnight we’ve had Sir Marcus Rashford banging the drum for our brave boys, and Baron Lothar Matthaüs bringing up the prospect of penalties, the old devil.

No one was interested in the story, in which the unemployed bachelor ends up running around after a cohort of old ladies whose spirit and vigour remain undimmed despite various ailments. Everyone thought he was crazy: who would be interested in a funny film about four old women and a middle-aged bloke? Related: Gianni Di Gregorio: The incidental director Then, after a life working in the theatre and as an assistant director, Di Gregorio co-wrote the celebrated mafia drama, Gomorrah, with Matteo Garrone, and his fortune changed. Garrone encouraged him to resurrect his earlier film idea and offered to produce while Di Gregorio starred and directed. Mid-August Lunch – a gorgeous, unsentimental comedy in which the collective naughtiness of the old ladies entertains more with each viewing – went on to win the debut director prize at the Venice film festival in 2008 and became an Italian arthouse hit. Two more films starring “Gianni” followed: The Salt of Life, the celebrated sequel to Mid-August Lunch, in which Gianni’s 96-year-old on-screen mother plays poker with her friends while her son laments his increasing invisibility to women (without, thank God, ever being lascivious) and the lesser known Good for Nothing, in which Gianni is a put-upon civil servant who has to learn to say no. And now there is Citizens of the World, a tender comedy in which yet another version of Gianni – this time a retired Latin professor – plots with two other pensioners to move to a country where their state pensions will go further. Until, that is, a young African migrant makes them rethink their plans. Gorgeous, unsentimental comedy … Mid-August Lunch. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo When I first met Di Gregorio in 2011, he took me on a tour of Rome in his 40-year-old Fiat 500, rolling cigarettes as the car bumped over the cobbles around the Colosseum and laughing about the fact that Mid-August Lunch could never have been made with old men because “they would have spent the entire film crying and being hypochondriacs! The men you see sitting in the bar in The Salt of Life won’t even go to the cinema to see the film they’re in, whereas the women in Mid-August Lunch were planning trips to Venice.” And yet, during the decade that followed The Salt of Life, he changed his mind and made Citizens of the World. Why? Di Gregorio, now 71, is talking on the phone from the large flat in Rome in which he has lived with his wife and two daughters since his mother’s death; I am immediately reminded of his warmth, humility and throaty laugh. “I will tell you why! Matteo Garrone called me and said, ‘You are the specialist when it comes to making films about old guys. You have to make a film about a group of male pensioners with very small pensions.’ It was such a simple but brilliant idea. There aren’t enough portrayals of adventurous pensioners on screen, nor explorations of friendship between men.” The various versions of Gianni that Di Gregorio plays in his films allow the director to explore different stages of his life and, as he ages, he is finding himself more like the women planning trips to Venice than the lazy men in the bar. “The older I get, the fewer fears I have. Nowadays 70 is young! There is still so much to do, so much to explore.” Celebrated sequel … The Salt of Life Photograph: Publicity image from film company In 2011, Di Gregorio told me that he searches for the comedy in life because he is melancholic by nature; he is also very good at using irony to explore ageing, in a similar way to Larry David. Might he even be the Italian Larry David? He laughs. “Grazie! Grazie! I am truly flattered by that comparison. Seeing yourself with irony is particularly important when you’re in your 70s.” Like David’s Curb Your Enthusiasm, Di Gregorio’s work is about nothing and everything. There is always the portrayal of the everyday in Italy – a glass of white on the pavement outside a bar, a thin slice of pizza a taglio – but, in Citizens of the World, there is also open criticism of the Italian government’s shameful handling of migrants. “While I was writing about the escapades of three pensioners, there were stories on the news every day of migrants arriving in Italy on dinghies or of boats overturning and migrants drowning. I got the idea of a young African guy, Abu, hanging around with the three pensioners because I wanted to explore the notions of acceptance, of tolerance, of welcoming people to our country.” He sighs. “The Italian government has imposed some very harsh laws against migrants and no one seems to know what to do. It also becomes clear in the film that Abu is the one who needs to travel the most, not the three old Romans. Something incredible happened after we finished the film: Salih Saadin Khalid, who plays Abu, is a real migrant and he used the money we paid him to leave Italy and join his family in Canada! It gave us so much joy.” Italy is slowly easing out of lockdown and, after an initial period of “blackout” during which he couldn’t read, write or even watch a movie, Di Gregorio is now desperate to start shooting his next film and to enjoy a glass of wine at his local bar. “Food and wine are in our DNA. Italians always manage to eat well during a crisis, even if they don’t have much money. It’s a consolation.” And, once the pandemic is over, might Di Gregorio consider escaping from Italy like his on-screen alter ego? He laughs, both thrilled and appalled at the idea. “I haven’t managed to yet! I still live in the apartment that my mother once lived in. I don’t have to travel far to make my films. I am completely rooted here in Rome, like an ancient tree.” • Citizens of the World is available on Curzon Home Cinema from 12 June.","Id":"film/2020/jun/10/gianni-di-gregorio-italian-larry-david-citizens-of-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webTitle":"'The older I get, the less I fear': meet the Italian Larry David","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/10/gianni-di-gregorio-italian-larry-david-citizens-of-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2020/jun/10/gianni-di-gregorio-italian-larry-david-citizens-of-the-world","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts","wordcount":1019,"webPublicationDate":"2020-06-10T07:00:14Z","id":"film/2020/jun/10/gianni-di-gregorio-italian-larry-david-citizens-of-the-world","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"My week of speaking – and living – Italian in Italy’s undiscovered heartland","body":"‘Eccoci qua!” announces Fernando, pulling the minibus into the side of the road. Ahead of us, the hilltop town we have driven nearly three hours from Rome to reach shimmers in the late afternoon sun. Agnone is a picturesque settlement of some 5,000 inhabitants, all of whom – starting with Fernando, a local dairy farmer and occasional chauffeur – appear to have been sworn not to speak English to us. Agnone This isn’t hard, because the town is in Italy’s least-known province, Molise – a region so “undiscovered” that even the Italians have a standing joke, Il Molise non esiste. There are 10 of us – nine women and a man, from Australia, the US, the UK and France – and we are here for a total immersion language course called Live and Learn Italian. As its founder and director Jenifer Landor emphasises at our first evening together in an open-air pizzeria, it is not so much about the classes as the experience (lesson one: Italians think it’s weird to drink wine with pizza). Over the course of a week, this approach will take us up a mountain with artisanal baker Mercede and her devoted farm dog, and down into a 600-year-old wine cellar to sample Carlo’s wines, that are deemed so sensitive they are unable to travel beyond their home town (though he pours so generously that this is unlikely to be put to the test). We will make (and eat) ravioli in the kitchen of retired shoe-seller Maria, who has become a celebrated home cook, and meet up with the latest generation of the Di Nucci family, who forsook centuries of migratory shepherding – the transumanza – to set up a thriving cheese factory. Agnone is in the little-known Molise province east of Rome Photograph: _richphotos_/to come We’re split into three groups on the basis of a written test and an interview with the three young teachers who will take charge of classroom tuition. It’s a little bit daunting but, as Landor says, it is to ensure nobody finds themselves bored or out of their depth. Complete beginners are discouraged from signing up, as they would miss out on the interaction with local people. “It’s up to you if you want to do the homework – you’re not schoolchildren,” she tells us. There’s a burst of ironic hilarity midway through the week when we discover the Italian for short cut (scorciatoia) but as my relatively advanced group quickly discovers, Italian is full of devilish prepositions and unlikely idioms, so it pays to do the legwork. Lessons take place each morning in an elegant former convent converted into a library and museum – its polished corridors flanked by rooms full of yellowing books. Only towards the end of the week do we discover a shuttered chamber containing a replica of the region’s most venerable artefact: La Tavola Osca. By now we are well-versed in the classical history of the area, having spent an afternoon being shown around an ancient amphitheatre carved into the hillside of a neighbouring settlement evocatively named Pietrabbondante. Samnite amphitheatre near Agnone. Photograph: Vincenzo Capone/Getty Images The original Osca (as it is affectionately called) is in the British Museum and is a small bronze tablet inscribed from right to left with the laws of the Samnite people, who ruled this part of Italy from the sixth century BC until the Roman empire took over. Their five tribes traded with Greece and worshipped Ulysses – and remains of their civilisation are still being dug out of the Molise hillsides. It is astonishing to sit on stone amphitheatre benches that Samnite stonemasons, chiselling away two centuries before Christ, smoothed into curves designed to mirror and support the human back – Italy’s first ergonomic seating, we are told. There is another copy of the Osca in the B&B where four of us are staying – the family home of artist Tonina. Though she lives in a flat nearby, the four-storey house is full of her craftwork and her memories. She greets us each morning at a table groaning with breakfast delicacies – mounds of ricotta drizzled with a local liqueur, plates piled with cakes and bread, waiting to be slathered in homemade apricot and cherry jams. With the food comes the first of the day’s Italian conversation, for which we are sometimes joined by Tonina’s maths teacher sister: this isn’t a course for people with a limited appetite for carbs and chat any more than it’s for those who find walking a drag, though at least some of the breakfast calories are burned off by frequent yomps up and down Agnone’s cobbled streets. A visit to the bell foundry Photograph: PR Nor is it a course for those with an aversion to being summoned by bells: Agnone is a town of 14 churches, most of them equipped with the massive clangers that are its claim to a niche sort of fame. The Marinelli bell foundry in the centre of town is said to be Italy’s oldest family business. Since the 14th century, the Marinellis have been sending their campane to churches and monasteries throughout the Catholic world, from Africa to South America. A video in its museum shows a succession of popes blessing the soon-to-be bells as sluice gates are opened to let moulten bronze surge infernally along channels in the foundry floor. It still makes 30 or more bells to order each year, and when we visit workers are about to crack open the latest huge clay cast. It’s a make-or-break moment that will reveal whether the painstakingly decorated bell will ring true or have to be fed back into the smelting vats. In the past, the town rang to the sound of gold-, iron- and coppersmiths, though almost all of the workshops are closed now – testament to the depopulation that recently led to Molise offering €700 a month for three years to anyone willing to live and set up a business in one of its smaller towns. Course participants on a local walk Photograph: Claudio Vitale/PR There’s nothing much for young people to do here, sighs Tonina, though they all pile back for their summer holidays and the town’s historic winter warmer – the Ndocciata fire festival on Christmas Eve, which involves columns of men wearing necklaces of flaming sticks. Most people sign up to the course for two weeks, but by the end of just one I’m surprised to find myself chatting away a raffica, unabashed by my all-too-frequent errori – not least when I loudly mistake a fertility symbol carved into the amphitheatre for a bird that has lost a wing. (Without missing a beat, our guide finds a simpler synonym for phallus.) By the time we have rattled back to Rome in the minibus, several of us have come to an agreement: we’ll be back, but first we have to work off all those breakfasts. Arrividerci, Agnone. • The course was provided by Live and Learn Italian, which has a week in a shared room from €1,325pp, including breakfast and six dinners, activities, excursions and transfers from Rome.

Authorities in the Italian capital have now enforced a slew of rules, updated from legislation drafted in 1946, as they seek to clamp down on uncouth behaviour that has long been a source of frustration. One of the measures is a permanent ban on modern-day centurions – men who dress up in tunics and leather breastplates, wielding plastic swords – and make money by posing for photos. Sanz is not a centurion – he is in Rome with a group of friends for his stag do – but he might be mistaken for one. Related: Romans revolt as tourists turn their noses up at city’s decay “We just dressed up like this for fun,” he said. “So long as I don’t make a disturbance, I guess I’ll be OK. The bad thing would be to get drunk while dressed like this. I can understand such rules and I’m glad to know about them now.” But it wasn’t just Sanz. The Trevi Fountain area was full of people unwittingly committing transgressions, particularly those flouting the ban on “messy” eating near monuments. “This is against the law now?” asked Giuseppe, a visitor from central Italy, as he tucked into pizza while standing by a church opposite the fountain. “I didn’t know, but I think it’s a good thing. They have a similar law in Venice. You shouldn’t be eating by monuments and making a mess.” Clara Jankovitch, a tourist from Hungary, was perched on the steps of the church enjoying an ice-cream. “I can understand pizza and sandwiches, but surely an ice-cream is OK? Look around, everyone is eating one,” she said. It is unclear whether people will be served a penalty for such infractions or simply get a ticking off from the tourist police patrolling historic sites, but Rome authorities have promised “severe fines” for those caught taking a dip in the city’s fountains – a frequent occurrence during the summer. Other rules include bans on wheeled suitcases and buggies being dragged down historic staircases, walking around bare-chested, and pub crawls. The authorities are also taking aim at “nuisance drunks” or people who sing on public transport, as well as those who wrap their mouths around the nozzles of the city’s drinking fountains. Illegal street trading and ticket touting outside tourist sights have also been banned, as has the Roman custom of hanging laundry out to dry between neighbouring buildings. “Old regulations have been updated to adapt to the needs of a modern society,” said Marco Cardilli, deputy chief of staff and security delegate at Rome’s council.","Id":"world/2019/jun/07/rome-clamps-down-on-tourists-uncouth-behaviour","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"When in Rome, don't dress as a centurion, say city authorities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/07/rome-clamps-down-on-tourists-uncouth-behaviour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/jun/07/rome-clamps-down-on-tourists-uncouth-behaviour","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":440,"webPublicationDate":"2019-06-07T12:47:40Z","id":"world/2019/jun/07/rome-clamps-down-on-tourists-uncouth-behaviour","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"What can I use in Italian food if I can’t eat tomatoes?","body":"I’ve stopped eating tomatoes for health reasons, but I like cooking Italian food. Are there any alternatives to tomatoes in dishes such as lasagne and caponata? Charles, North Yorkshire According to a study by the Technical University of Munich last year, about 1.5% of the population in northern Europe and up to 16% in Italy are affected by tomato allergies. While this number is relatively small, a life without lasagne and caponata is no life at all. For Joe Trivelli, head chef at the River Cafe, the answer is simple: “Just don’t put them in.” But I won’t clock off early just yet. Tomatoes were a relatively late addition to Italian cuisine, with pasta sauces and braises coloured red in only the late 16th and 17th century. As the Guardian’s food writer in Rome Rachel Roddy – whose use of the fruit has decreased since moving to Italy – puts it, we need to move away from tomato domination. “So many Italian dishes, such as hunter’s chicken, braised rabbit or oxtail stew, have a pre-tomato version,” she says, “and eight times out of 10, I prefer them.” Seek out the original versions, then focus on your use of olive oil, garlic, chilli and, if you’re making pasta sauce, the starchy pasta cooking water. Roddy has a few tricks, though, for achieving that umami flavour when tomatoes aren’t in play: “Anchovies, parmesan, porcini and herbs, such as rosemary and sage, can give that meatiness you might otherwise miss.” Related: Rachel Roddy’s recipe for mushroom and herb tagliatelle | A kitchen in Rome Caponata can live quite happily without tomatoes, too, Trivelli says, as long as you balance the other ingredients with soffritto [a mix of finely diced onion, carrot and celery] and “a bit of vinegar” to create that depth and acidity. Look to Rome for inspiration for pastas, salads and braises, Roddy advises: “They’re great with vegetables such as pumpkin, which has a lovely, rich flavour.” Anna Jones took this approach in her recent pizza recipe swapping a tomato base for squash, which had been roasted with olive oil and chilli, then blitzed and loosened with a little vegetable stock. Lasagne is also within your grasp, Charles. Trivelli’s favourite (tomato or otherwise) is an artichoke version: remove the tough outer leaves, pare away the green flesh from the base of the artichoke and stem, scrape out the hairy choke, then slice, cook and use to layer up between sheets of lasagne, bechamel and cheese. Slow-cooked red peppers, if you can eat them, give a good base for sauces, stews and spooning over mozzarella or burrata, says Tim Siadatan, chef and co-owner of Padella, a second site of which has just opened in Shoreditch. “Put them on a charcoal grill or barbecue to get a lovely, smoky flavour,” he says, but a gas stove will also work. Cook the peppers until the outsides are nice and blistered, then transfer to a bowl and cover to steam. Once they are cool enough to handle, Siadatan peels off the skin, removes the seeds and finely slices. Then, in a separate pan, he adds “a load of sliced garlic and some dried chilli, and sweats down in olive oil over a low heat until they’re sweet and sticky.” Season with salt and pepper, add a splash of cabernet sauvignon vinegar, some fresh marjoram (if you can’t find any, use basil) and a dollop of mascarpone or creme fraiche, and you’ll have a creamy sauce to wrap around penne. Alternatively, Siadatan says, “add cooked runner beans cut into inch-long pieces with some mascarpone and basil, and you’ve got a garnish for lamb; or throw in some chickpeas, lentils or other pulses for a stewy vibe.” Life without tomatoes can still be rosy. • Do you have a culinary dilemma?

We’ve addressed this several times on the liveblog over the past few weeks, but here we go again... The administration’s travel policy did not “cut off” all travel from China, as Trump calims. Although non-US citizens were prohibited from entering the country if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks, American citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family members were exempt. Similarly, Trump’s European travel restrictions exempted citizens, residents and their families. And initially, the restrictions didn’t apply to the UK and Ireland, as well as most Eastern European countries. Epidemiologists have told the Guardian that these policies likely had little impact, as they were enacted after the virus was already spreading within the US.

The investigation may find that things can be “remedied,” but it might not. 12.12am BST Trump is asked if he would reconsider his decision to cut funding to the WHO if Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was to step down as director general. “I don’t know the gentleman,” he says. Then he talks again about the WHO’s “support” of China. 12.06am BST “The governors will be very respectful of the presidency. Again, this isn’t me, this is the presidency,” Trump says after being asked about reopening the economy and his claims of authority over the states. 12.03am BST US President Donald Trump is now taking questions. Watch live below: Updated at 12.04am BST 11.59pm BST In my absolutely darkest moments right after the 2016 election I could not imagine this moment: thousands of Americans dying a day, an economic contraction to rival the Great Depression and Trump just listing off the names of CEOs while congratulating himself for a job well done — Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) April 14, 2020 11.57pm BST Just a reminder, as Trump reads out an endless – so far – name of private companies, that one in ten working Americans have lost their jobs in this crisis. 11.54pm BST Trump has been reading companies and their CEOS who are working with the administration for several minutes, riffing on some of the names. \"Just met with Sam!\" — Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) April 14, 2020 Wait, why is the president just reading off the names of companies? — Molly Jong-Fast\uD83C\uDFE1 (@MollyJongFast) April 14, 2020 If you're looking for stock tips for tomorrow morning here's nearly a minute of Trump reading off the names of random companies and CEOs pic.twitter.com/Z0N0mHxwWe — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 14, 2020 11.53pm BST And pharmaceutical companies.

There are too many to list here, but rest assured, Trump is a fan of US banks. 11.45pm BST Trump is talking about a saliva-based test. “I call it innovation under pressure,” he says. Now he is talking about the economy. “There’s never been an economy like we had.” “Just over a month ago we set records nobody has ever set.” “The plans to reopen the economy are close to finalised and we will soon be sharing details.” Now onto the states: “I will be speaking to 50 governors shortly and I will be authorising each governor to implement a re-opening plan,” he says – according to the appropriate conditions. That’s a bit of a relief - that he doesn’t plan to use what he yesterday called “absolute power” (which he does not have) to force states to reopen. One day after (falsely) claiming he has \"total authority\" to reopen states, Trump has walked that back and is now saying he'll merely consult with individual governors about when they'll get their economies up and running again pic.twitter.com/yNB7BClkfD — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 14, 2020 Ha.

And he’s back onto the ventilators: Every time he says ventilator, drink. Unused ventilators, two shots. #TrumpPressConf #Ventilator — Brian Cogan (@TheBrianCogan) April 14, 2020 Updated at 11.49pm BST 11.38pm BST Adam Boehler, a friend of Jared Kushner and administration official spoke briefly at the podium. “There are over 60,000 ventilators at hospitals that are not in use,” he said —so the government has launched a program to move ventilators where they’re needed. “There has been no American who has needed a ventilator that hasn’t recieved one,” Boehler said. We’re working on fact-checking Boehler’s absolute claim. In the meantime, here’s what we know about ventilator shortages in the US: It is true that some states, so far, have ended up with more ventilators than they originally projected they would need. California has loaned 500 ventilators to states like New York. California hospitals managed to increase their stock from 7,500 machines to more than 11,000, according to the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom. “That has put less strain and pressure on the state’s effort to procure additional ventilators,” Newsom said. However, that doesn’t mean that there isn’t a national shortage. The US has roughly 173,000 ventilators, according to the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University. Experts from Harvard Medical School predict that the US could end up needing 31 times that number to treat coronavirus patients. An article in the New England Journal of Medicine published on Wednesday 25 March categorically concluded that the US does not have enough ventilators to treat patients with Covid-19 in the coming months. 11.37pm BST Trump is calling on various members of of his “Dynamic Ventilator Reserve” to sing his praises now.

But the president himself praised China’s transparency — on January 24: China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 24, 2020 11.29pm BST Fact check: Trump said that the WHO at some point implied that the coronavirus was “not communicable” — there is no evidence that the organization did that. He also said “there was credible” information in December to suspect human-to-human transmission and the WHO did not respond appropriately. “So much death has been caused by their mistakes,” he said. But Trump himself ignored and undermined the severity of the crisis well into March. The president was warned at the end of January by one of his top White House advisers that coronavirus had the potential to kill hundreds of thousands of Americans and derail the US economy, unless tough action were taken immediately, new memos have revealed. The memos were written by Trump’s economic adviser, Peter Navarro, and circulated via the National Security Council widely around the White House and federal agencies. They show that even within the Trump administration alarm bells were ringing by late January, at a time when the president was consistently downplaying the threat of Covid-19. Moreover, the US intelligence community, public health experts and officials in Trump’s own administration had warned for yearsthat the country was at risk from a pandemic, including specific warnings about a coronavirus outbreak. An October 2019 draft report by the Department of Health and Human Services, obtained by the New York Times: “drove home just how underfunded, underprepared and uncoordinated the federal government would be for a life-or-death battle with a virus for which no treatment existed,” the Times reported. 11.27pm BST Fact check: WHO Trump has accused the WHO of “severely mismanaging and covering up” the coronavirus crisis. The WHO has been criticized for a 14 January tweet, which Trump has referenced, that noted that a preliminary investigation by Chinese officials found no evidence of human-to-human transmission. However, by 30 January, the organization declared coronavirus a “public health emergency”, and went on to declare a pandemic on 11 March after numerous countries - including the US and UK - failed to follow its advice. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus spoke of “alarming levels of inaction” from many countries. The WHO “has been drained of power and resources”, said Richard Horton, editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet. “Its coordinating authority and capacity are weak. Its ability to direct an international response to a life-threatening epidemic is non-existent.” The Trump administration and the president himself repeatedly played down the crisis - specifically downplaying the threat to the US, inaccurately compared it to the flu and told his supporters that growing worries about the coronavirus was a “hoax”. By the time Trump announced travel restrictions from China on 31 January, most major airlines had already suspended flights, following the lead of several major international carriers that had stopped due to the outbreak. In late February, the president said the spread of Covid-19 in the US was not inevitable and the danger to Americans “remains very low”. He predicted that the number of cases diagnosed in the country, just 15 that time, could fall to zero in “a few days”. Updated at 11.27pm BST 11.26pm BST Trump hitting another talking point now: ventilators. “The scariest day of my life so far,” says Trump, was when he was told the country was short “hundreds of thousands of ventilators. This is the system we inherited.” 11.26pm BST As he has done repeatedly over the course of the pandemic, Trump is boasting about his decision ti impose travel bans. Now, he is again being critical of China. “The WHO pushed China’s misinformation.” “So much death has been caused by their mistakes” “For the time being we will redirect global health and work directly with others. All of the aid we send will be discussed at very powerful levels.” 11.25pm BST Watch the briefing live here: 11.25pm BST Trump is expanding on his decision to temporarily cut funding to the WHO. Just a note that we will be fact checking these claims. We have deep concerns whether America’s funding is being used in the best way possible, he said. “The WHO failed to obtain, vet and share information,” and they “failed to investigate credible reports in China,” he says. “They parroted and publicly endorsed the idea that there was not human to human transmission despite evidence to the contrary” Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation of the ground and to investigate China’s claims, he says, it would have saved countless lives and economic damage. 11.18pm BST Trump says he will today instruct administration to halt WHO funding Hi, Helen Sullivan with you now for another White House Press Briefing. “Today I am intructing my administration to halt funding for the World Health Organization”, Trump has just said. We’ll bring you more shortly. 11.16pm BST The northern Nigeria economic powerhouse state of Kano will impose a seven-day lockdown, a spokesman for the governor has said. The country has recorded 373 cases and 11 deaths. 10.45pm BST Starmer warned the “silent pressures” on communities across the UK “cannot be underestimated” and said that, to maintain morale and hope, people “need a sense of what comes next”. He urged Raab to commit to setting out the criteria the government will use to inform how and when it intends to ease the lockdown; to publish the exit strategy now or in the coming week; and to outline the sectors and core public services that are most likely to see restrictions eased. A government source has told the Press Association: “Our strategy is focused on saving lives. We have been clear that all decisions will be guided by the scientific advice and data. Talk of an exit strategy before we have reached the peak risks confusing the critical message that people need to stay at home in order to protect our NHS and save lives.” 10.40pm BST The UK government is being urged to publish its lockdown exit strategy this week. The leader of the opposition Labour party, Sir Keir Starmer, has written to Dominic Raab, who is deputising for the prime minister, to say his party would support an extension – but that ministers need to explain their plan. The question for Thursday, therefore, is no longer about whether the lockdown should be extended, but about what the government’s position is on how and when it can be eased in due course and on what criteria that decision will be taken. Ministers have argued that now is not the time to talk about this. I profoundly disagree. Overcoming this crisis requires taking the British public with you. Millions of people have played their part and exceeded government assumptions about their willingness to make sacrifices and to stay at home in the national interest. In return, the government needs to be open and transparent with the public about how it believes the lockdown will ease and eventually end, how this decision will be informed and what measures are being put in place to plan for this eventuality. 10.28pm BST Amazon has fired two employees after they publicly denounced the company’s treatment of warehouse workers during the pandemic. Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa said they were fired after internally circulating a petition about health risks for Amazon warehouse workers during the Covid-19 crisis. Costa had worked at the company for more than 15 years and Cunningham had been an employee for more than five. Costa said: I don’t regret standing up with my co-workers. This is about human lives, and the future of humanity. In this crisis, we must stand up for what we believe in, have hope, and demand from our corporations and employers a basic decency that’s been lacking in this crisis.

The south-coast club said they were “aware of criticisms of Premier League clubs applying for this scheme” during the suspension to the football season caused by the coronavirus pandemic. We have listened to our supporters and have reversed our decision to furlough these employees. Liverpool and Tottenham have also reversed their initial moves to make use of the government’s job retention scheme, which covers the cost of 80% of the salaries of furloughed staff, up to £2,500 per month for each employee.

Nick Jeffery, the chief executive of Vodafone UK, said: Burning down masts means damaging important national infrastructure. In practice, this means families not being able to say a final goodbye to their loved ones; hard-working doctors, nurses, and police officers not being able to phone their kids, partners or parents for a comforting chat. Related: Arsonists attack phone mast serving NHS Nightingale hospital 9.46pm BST In Germany, local media are reporting that zoos are making contingency plans, including killing some of the animals, should the lockdown continue without a solution to their financial troubles. Neumünster Zoo’s director has told Die Welt they have “listed the animals we will have to slaughter first” and said some may even have to be fed to others. But even such drastic plans would not be sufficient to solve the problem. Verena Kaspari told the paper the step would be a last resort and “unpleasant”. She referred to the plight of the piscivorous animals and added: “If it comes to it, I’ll have to euthanise animals, rather than let them starve.” 9.27pm BST US intelligence indicates the virus likely occurred naturally, as opposed to being created in a Chinese laboratory – but there is no certainty either way, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff has said. The remarks by US army General Mark Milley could fan speculation about the virus’ origins; something China has dismissed as a conspiracy theory that is unhelpful to the fight against the pandemic. Asked whether he had any evidence that the virus perhaps began in a Chinese laboratory and was perhaps released accidentally, Milley was non-committal at a Pentagon news briefing. There’s a lot of rumour and speculation in a wide variety of media, the blog sites, etc. It should be no surprise to you that we’ve taken a keen interest in that and we’ve had a lot of intelligence take a hard look at that. And I would just say, at this point, it’s inconclusive although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural. But we don’t know for certain. 9.17pm BST British charities have said thousands of homeless people are still on the streets despite the government’s aim to house all rough sleepers by the end of last month. Local authorities in England were urged to find accommodation for all rough sleepers by 29 March, to protect them during the pandemic. But a coalition of charities, including Streets Kitchen, StreetVet, The Outside Project, Simon Community and the Museum of Homelessness, believe as many as 20% of homeless people could still be sleeping rough. It is also believed one in 10 rough sleepers will or have been refused accommodation because they have pets. The organisations have called for all homeless people to be housed, allowed to keep their pets while in accommodation and to be provided with adequate protective equipment and support. John Glackin, of Streets Kitchen, said: We understand around 20% of homeless people in England have yet to be housed - which equates to tens of thousands of people. However, we suspect the real figure is much higher from the amount of people we’re still feeding out on the streets. 9.07pm BST The International Monetary Fund views its $1tn (£790bn) in lending capacity as “quite substantial” to help members deal with the pandemic, but believes further resources may be needed as the full brunt of the crisis reaches developing countries. Its chief economist, Gita Gopinath, has told Reuters that 100 of the 189 members – of whom half are low-income countries – have now contacted the global lender about receiving emergency funding to beef up their efforts to contain the outbreak vand mitigate its economic impact. She welcomed an agreement by international creditors to suspend debt payments for the poorest countries through the end of the year as a “very, very good step”, but said debt relief measures might have to be extended into 2021 since the worst of the pandemic’s effects had not yet been felt in many of the poorest countries. Updated at 9.07pm BST 9.02pm BST The European commission plans to narrow controls on the export of protective equipment to just a single product – masks – as well as exempt the countries of the western Balkans from the restrictions. The EU executive, which oversees trade policy for the 27 EU member states, has set out a draft regulation to apply for 30 days from 26 April. The adjustments were designed to meet the EU’s global commitments in tackling the pandemic. The bloc’s current restrictions apply to protective spectacles and visors, face shields, protective garments, gloves, as well as mouth and nose masks. These products can only be exported to a non-EU country with an authorisation granted by individual EU countries. The restrictions were due to run from 15 March to 25 April. 8.38pm BST Rio de Janeiro’s governor, Wilson Witzel, has announced he has tested positive; one of the highest profile politicians to be struck down by the illness in Brazil. In a Twitter video, the 52-year-old politician said he had been feeling ill since last Friday and had been suffering a temperature, a sore throat and loss of smell.

Trump, who is head of the G7 this year, had to cancel the group’s annual summit, which he had planned to hold at the presidential retreat of Camp David, Maryland, in June. The Group of Seven nations include the United States, France, Britain, Italy, Canada, Japan and Germany, and all seven of them have been hit hard by the outbreak. The White House spokesman, Judd Deere, said: Working together, the G7 is taking a whole-of-society approach to tackle the crisis across multiple areas, including health, finance, humanitarian assistance, and science and technology. 8.08pm BST France summons Chinese envoy France’s foreign minister has summoned the Chinese envoy after the embassy published a second article on its website criticising western handling of the coronavirus crisis. Jean-Yves Le Drian said: Certain publicly voiced opinions by representatives of the Chinese embassy in France are not in line with the quality of the bilateral relation between our two countries. The latest comments on the embassy’s website, which in part suggested western countries have left their pensioners to die in nursing homes, come after France ordered millions of masks from China to curb a shortage in the country. 7.51pm BST The US State Department has reported the first fatality among the staff at its Washington headquarters, bringing the total death toll in its global workforce due to the outbreak to five. William Walters, the deputy chief medical officer for operations in the Bureau of Medical Services, said: The individual passed over the weekend. He was hospitalised for some time fighting the coronavirus. Walters said that the civil servant had been out of the office for more than two weeks. He did not provide further details including in what role the individual served at the State Department, citing privacy issues. 7.03pm BST Summary Here are the latest headlines from our Covid-19 coverage so far on Tuesday. The International Monetary Fund slashed its forecasts for global growth and warned of a slump in output this year unparalleled since the Great Depression of the 1930s. It said the “Great Lockdown” is likely to cause a drop in activity more painful than the recession that followed the banking meltdown of the 2008. A further 778 deaths were recorded in UK hospitals taking the total to at least 12,107. The true extent is likely to be greater because the data do not include deaths in other settings and many hospitals are still collating figures from the bank holiday. “We think we are at the apex,” the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced after the state recorded a small decrease in its the number (1,600) of new patients coming into New York hospitals on Monday. Italy, Spain and Austria allowed partial returns to work as countries across Europe report further falls in new cases and begin taking the first cautious steps out of lockdown to revive their battered economies. Global cases passed 1.9 million, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, whose tally showed at least 1,945,055 people have been infected and 121,897 have died since the outbreak began. Britain’s economy could shrink by 35% and unemployment rise by more than 2 million people due to the crisis, the official economics forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility warned, as it forecast a 13% fall in GDP for 2020. Mary Lou McDonald, the leader of Ireland’s Sinn Féin party, tested positive for Covid-19. She says she is no longer deemed to be infected or infectious and hopes to return to work next week. She was tested on 28 March and got the result on Monday, a two-week wait reflecting delays and glitches that have plagued testing in Ireland. Vladimir Putin warned Russians to brace for an “extraordinary” crisis. As Moscow tightened its lockdown measures, Russia reported its highest daily infection figures yet. That’s it from me, Damien Gayle, I’ll be with you again tomorrow. Updated at 7.07pm BST 6.53pm BST The Czech Republic is the latest to announce plans to ease its lockdown, with a five-stage plan to remove restrictions beginning on 20 April and ending on 8 June, AFP reports. An EU member of 10.7 million people, the Czech Republic registered 6,101 confirmed cases of the virus on Tuesday evening, including 161 deaths. “The epidemic is showing a downward trend,” the deputy health minister, Roman Prymula, said. Outlining the plan to reopen the country, the deputy prime minister, Karel Havlíček, told reporters: The scenario reckons with the coronavirus being under control as is currently the case. There might be changes. Radka Zvonarova, demi-soloist of the Czech National Ballet, wearing protective face mask while getting ready for a rehearsal on Sunday. Photograph: Martin Divíšek/EPA Havlíček said that first in line to reopen on 20 April would be open-air markets and crafts and trades with workshops, like shoe repairs or dressmakers. Weddings with up to 10 people will also be allowed and professional athletes will be able to train in smaller groups. Smaller shops that are not located in shopping malls will be able to do business again as of 27 April. Larger shops outside shopping malls and fitness centres without dressing rooms will open on 11 May, while restaurants and pubs will be allowed to serve their products in outdoor beer gardens from 25 May. On the same day, the government will open hairdressers’ and cosmetics salons, museums, galleries and the outdoor parts of zoos. Shopping malls, restaurants, pubs, hotels, theatres, castles, zoos, and cultural and sports events up to 50 people as well as larger weddings will be back as of 8 June. The education minister Robert Plaga said the government would start re-opening schools and universities gradually from 20 April, but added that they probably would not open fully before the summer holidays starting on 1 July.

The number of people in intensive care has fallen for the sixth day, down to 6,730, from 6,821 on Monday. 6.18pm BST Health authorities in Poland on Tuesday reported 270 new confirmed cases of coronavirus and 18 more deaths in the past 24 hours, as the country’s health minister said the government would begin to “slowly defrost” the economy from the end of this week. The total number of confirmed cases in Poland now stands at 7,202, with 263 deaths. With the numbers of new infections slowing in recent days, the health minister, Łukasz Szumowski, said the isolation had proved effective, but “if the economy does not move, if we have a tragedy and economic collapse, people will die of other oncological diseases, rare diseases.” (Thank you Google Translate...) Current restrictions on shopping malls, cinemas, theatres, hairdressers and beauty parlours are due to end on Sunday, while schools and kindergartens are due to reopen the following week, local media report. However, even as plans are being made to end Poland’s lockdown, the Polish health ministry announced that from Thursday face masks would become mandatory in public. ❗️❗️Od 16 kwietnia każda osoba przebywająca w miejscu publicznym będzie miała obowiązek zasłaniania ust i nosa ❗️❗️ \uD83D\uDE37 #koronawirus pic.twitter.com/Iq03D7NE9s — Ministerstwo Zdrowia (@MZ_GOV_PL) April 14, 2020 Updated at 6.39pm BST 6.06pm BST Canada shutdown 'going to be weeks still' Justin Trudeau has warned that Canada’s economic shutdown is likely to remain in place for weeks, as coronavirus infections continue to climb across the country, writes Leyland Cecco in Toronto. The prime minister said on Tuesday: I know people are interested in when things will go back to normal. The reality is, it’s going to be weeks still. It is going to be important to get our economy going – but we’re going to have to remain vigilant until such a time as a vaccine is found. Trudeau’s measured comments come in stark contrast to Donald Trump, who has grown increasingly frustrated with the protracted slowdown of the American economy and has clashed with state governors over deciding when measures will ease. As of Tuesday, Canada had recorded more than 26,100 cases of the coronavirus and 823 deaths, many of which happened at long-term care facilities.

The International Air Transport Association’s (Iata) latest estimate adds a further $62bn of lost revenue from its previous assessment in late March and is almost three times worse than its “worst-case scenario” from five weeks ago, with around 95% of international passenger traffic now lost due to travel restrictions. The figures would mean a 55% drop in revenue from 2019, as Iata factored in the extension of travel restrictions, a deepening recession and the further spread of Covid-19 to Africa and Latin America. Iata’s director general, Alexandre de Juniac, said: The industry’s outlook grows darker by the day. The scale of the crisis makes a sharp V-shaped recovery unlikely. Realistically, it will be a U-shaped recovery with domestic travel coming back faster than the international market. 5.50pm BST Ireland’s department of health has reported 41 new deaths from coronavirus, and 832 new cases. #COVID19 #coronavirus Statement from the National Public Health Emergency Team The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has today been informed that 41 people diagnosed with #COVID19 in Ireland have died. — Department of Health (@roinnslainte) April 14, 2020 Department of Health Covid19 press briefing https://t.co/IzseafFL6g — Department of Health (@roinnslainte) April 14, 2020 5.48pm BST Commercial creditors owed money by poor countries should only be eligible for government Covid-19 bailout cash if they agree to sign up to a comprehensive global debt deal, the head of one of the world’s leading charities has said, writes Larry Elliott, the Guardian’s economics editor. Despite signs that the G20 group of developed and developing nations are edging towards an agreement on help for the most vulnerable nations, Inger Ashing, chief executive of Save the Children International, said the plan would only be fully effective if it included the private sector. Ashing said in an open letter to the G20 that commercial creditors, such as banks, commodity traders and asset management firms, accounted for almost half the $62bn (£42.2bn) debt payments due to be made by the world’s 75 lowest-income countries in 2020. The letter said: Commercial creditors account for almost half of scheduled 2020 payments. Allowing them an exemption would weaken any debt-relief initiative. Providing aid through the World Bank and other donors while allowing commercial debt payments to absorb a large share of the transfer would be the financial equivalent of pouring water into a bucket with large holes. To put the figures in context, commercial debt repayments would be equivalent to over half of the emergency Covid-19 financing being prepared by the World Bank for delivery through IDA. ... Official creditors should make it clear that they expect commercial creditors to apply comparable treatment. There are precedents which, if not directly applicable, could serve as a guide. These include the ‘Vienna Initiative’ through which European governments coordinated the response to the 2009 financial crisis. If necessary, governments should encourage participation by making access to special Covid-19 financing programmes conditional on commercial creditors participating in the debt standstill. Faced with a global public health emergency that demands a global financial response, governments must deploy their regulatory powers and financial resources in the interest. The G20 should work with the IMF and World Bank to convene a commercial creditors summit to agree terms for creditor participation in debt repayment suspension.

In a lengthy address to the nation on Tuesday, Museveni reaffirmed Uganda’s 35 restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus, adding that judging by the comparatively low number of infections in the country - 54 confirmed cases as of Monday - they seemed to have worked. On the extension, he added: The extra 21 days cannot be a mistake. After those 21 days, the virus will either be totally defeated or we shall be better prepared. Therefore, I would like to appeal to the Ugandans to observe the prohibitions already announced and summarised above. Stay at home except those carrying cargo, including food; the youth stop going into the trading centres to loiter. Be in the gardens with your parents. This is the season for planting. What are you doing in the trading centres? ... I thank the majority of Ugandans for cooperating and supporting the tough measures we have been announcing eve rsince the 18th of March, 2020. You have seen how much damage this virus has caused in other countries. We should not allow that to happen here. Museveni said that he made arrangements with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, for India to supply Uganda with hydroxychloroquine, the malaria drug believed by some to help treat Covid-19.

Roman police spokesman Nunzio Carbone told the news agency that the turtle was “as big as a pizza” but not wearing a lead. 4.52pm BST Sweden's coronavirus death toll passes 1,000 Doctors, virologists and epidemiologists in Sweden have denounced their government’s approach to tackling the coronavirus outbreak, as its death toll from Covid-19 increased by 114 in 24 hours, taking its total past 1,000. Unlike other parts of Europe, including its close neighbours Finland and Norway, Sweden has not imposed extraordinary lockdown orders to stem the spread of the virus, instead calling for citizens to take responsibility to follow social distancing guidelines. The strictest measures implemented so far have been gatherings of more than 50 people and a ban on visits to nursing homes. But its soft approach has drawn criticism. On Tuesday Sweden’s public health agency said it had recorded a total of 11,445 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 1,033 deaths. Neighbouring Finland, which has about half the population of Sweden, had as of Tuesday reported 64 deaths, and has closed down restaurants and schools. In an open letter, a group of 22 doctors, virologists and researchers from Sweden’s top hospitals, universities and research institutes pointed write: One would like to imagine that Sweden has also had a forward-looking strategy, especially as our country has always had a different way of dealing with the spread of infection than the rest of the world. One would like to imagine that our authorities have prepared well since the epidemic broke out in China, and especially since it was clear that the problem was likely to be global. … If there was a well-thought-out, well-functioning strategy for Swedish infection prevention work with Covid-19, Sweden would hardly have the same death toll as Italy today, and 10 times higher than Finland’s. If there had been a well-developed, well-functioning strategy, half of Stockholm’s elderly residents would not have been affected by the epidemic - and in some cases over 20% of the healthcare staff would be antibody positive. … The approach must be changed radically and quickly. As the disease-free virus spreads, it is necessary to increase social distance. Close schools and restaurants in the same way you do in Finland. Everyone who works with the elderly must wear adequate protective equipment. Prior to mass testing of infectiousness on all caring staff and testing for antibodies to sars-covid-2 so that established immune personnel can return to work. Require quarantine by the whole family if a member is ill or tests positive for viruses. Impress in society that anyone can be contagious.

America’s worst-affected state recorded a “small tick down” in hospitalisations, Cuomo said, but the number was basically flat. He said the change was “statistically irrelevant, but better than being up.” “We think we are at the apex,” Cuomo said, while noting that 1,600 new people came in to New York hospitals yesterday.

The island, which has strong cultural links with China, was hit early by the coronavirus but managed to keep initial infections low and stop the disease spreading locally. Checks on passengers from China began there on 31 December - the same day the new virus was first reported by Chinese authorities to the World Health Organization. Taiwan then suffered a second wave of cases as nationals returned home from overseas, but the latest figures offer hope that authorities have managed to bring it under control. Pictures from Taipei showed that – unlike most of the rest of the world – life continues pretty much as usual, save for the now ubiquitous face masks.

The Guatemalan government had asked the US not to send more than 25 deportees per flight, to give them health exams before departure and to certify that they were not infected. Despite these guidelines, there were 76 migrants on the first flight and 106 on the second, PA reports. At least three of the migrants who arrived on Monday were taken directly to a hospital for Covid-19 testing. One of the flights also included 16 unaccompanied minors, according to the Guatemalan Immigration Institute. Citing the epidemic, the US has started swiftly deporting unaccompanied minors rather than holding them in protective settings as specified by law. The flights were the same day that the US state department announced that aid would continue to Guatemala and the other Northern Triangle countries.

The conservative leader’s mother-in-law lives at the West Park long-term care home in a suburb of Toronto. The facility has had at least five coronavirus-related deaths. “And there’s thousands of families in the same position, wishing they could jump in there and help their loved one in there.” Doug Ford responds to a question during his daily Covid-19 update at Queen’s Park in Toronto.

In Montreal, 31 people died at a retirement facility, whose owners are accused of withholding medical files from provincial authorities and whose staff are alleged to walked off the job. In the Ontario town of Bobcaygeon, 29 people died at Pinecrest Nursing Home, which houses 65 residents. To date, more than 350 Canadians in retirement homes have died from the virus, making up nearly half of the 780 deaths across the country. Updated at 3.48pm BST 3.22pm BST A US federal appeals court panel has ruled that medication abortions, in which pills are taken to terminate a pregnancy, can be provided in Texas during the coronavirus pandemic. The Texas Republican governor, Greg Abbott, issued an executive order last month that bars non-essential medical procedures to ensure that health resources can go to treating coronavirus patients. The Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, has said that providing abortions other than for an immediate medical emergency would violate the order. In a ruling on Monday, a three-judge panel of the 5th US circuit court of appeals said that medication abortions can go forward. Over the weekend abortion clinics in Texas asked the supreme court to step in to allow medication abortions. Medication abortions involves taking one pill at a clinic, then taking a second pill 24 to 48 hours later, usually at home. Clinics have argued that medication abortions do not require personal protective equipment like masks, gloves and gowns that might be needed for coronavirus patients. Texas permits medication abortions during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.

More than a dozen government members, without protective masks, joined the ruling party leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, in open-air ceremonies in Warsaw on Friday for the 10th anniversary of the crash that killed Kaczyński’s twin, the then-president Lech Kaczyński, and 95 other prominent Poles.

Media and ordinary Poles have also been critical, saying the government showed contempt for its own restrictions. Several cyclists, walkers and at least one church have been fined the equivalent of almost €3,000 ($3,300) for infringing social distancing rules. The government spokesman Piotr Müller argued on Tuesday that the ceremonies were part of government members’ duties and were not banned under regulations permitting people to go to work. He added that members of prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki’s cabinet met face-to-face quite often. However, weekly government sessions and news conferences are held remotely by video. Kaczyński also came under strong public criticism for taking a limousine on Friday to his mother’s grave in Warsaw’s Powązki cemetery, which is closed to the public.

Updated at 2.36pm BST 2.19pm BST IMF predicts steepest downturn since the 1930s The International Monetary Fund has slashed its forecasts for global growth in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and warned of a slump in output this year unparalleled since the Great Depression of the 30s, writes Larry Elliott, the Guardian’s economics editor. In its half-yearly forecasts, the IMF said the “Great Lockdown” would cause a dramatic drop in activity that would be far more painful than the recession that followed the banking meltdown of the late 00s. The IMF said the sudden shock caused by the spread of the coronavirus meant it had been forced to tear up an estimate it made just three months ago of 3.3% global growth this year and replace it with an expected contraction of 3%. Until now, the downturn that followed the near-meltdown of the global financial system in late 2008 has been the most serious of the postwar ear, with global activity shrinking by 0.1% in 2009. Bigger output losses have now been pencilled in for 2020, concentrated in the rich economies of the west, which are forecast to shrink by 6.1% on average. Italy and Spain – the two worst-affected European economies from Covid-19 so far – will experience GDP falls of 9.1% and 8% respectively, the IMF said in its world economic outlook. Britain’s drop in output is put at 6.5%.

According to the latest figures, published on Tuesday, Russia has 21,102 confirmed cases of coronavirus, 13,002 of which have been detected in the capital, where new cases increased 1,489 overnight. Authorities say 170 people have died so far across Russia. Moscow has rushed to reconfigure hospitals to treat patients with the virus and made thousands of new beds available, but officials said those efforts looked insufficient and that they had to ramp up capacity further. In a statement, seen by Reuters, the Moscow health department said it would reconfigure 24 more hospitals and planned to have a total of 21,000 beds available within the next 10 days. But, the statement added: The operational headquarters predicts that despite the inclusion of an increasing number of state, federal and commercial clinics, a shortage of beds in redeveloped hospitals is possible in the next two to three weeks.

In a stark assessment of the economic fallout from Covid-19 as lockdown measures bring the country to a standstill, the Office for Budget Responsibility said that gross domestic product (GDP) could plunge by more than a third in the second quarter of the year and 13% for 2020 as a whole. Sounding the alarm that the immediate hit to living standards could be worse than the initial shock of the 2008 financial crisis, it said joblessness could hit 10% by the end of June and government borrowing this year would increase at the fastest pace since the second world war. Here is an extract from the OBR’s report: We do not attempt to predict how long the economic lockdown will last – that is a matter for the government, informed by medical advice. But, to illustrate some of the potential fiscal effects, we assume a three-month lockdown due to public health restrictions followed by another three-month period when they are partially lifted. For now, we assume no lasting economic hit. Real GDP falls 35% in the second quarter, but bounces back quickly. Unemployment rises by more than 2 million to 10% in the second quarter, but then declines more slowly than GDP recovers. Policy measures support households and companies’ finances through the shock. Public sector net borrowing increases by £218bn in 2020-21 relative to our March budget forecast (to reach £273bn or 14% of GDP), before falling back close to forecast in the medium term. That would be the largest single-year deficit since the second world war. For more from the UK, follow our UK-focused coronavirus live blog.

Notis Mitarachi made the announcement after Human Rights Watch today launched a campaign demanding that the Greek government free unaccompanied migrant children “from police cells and detention centres” because of the heightened risk of exposure to coronavirus. 1 \\ The campaign to #FreeTheKids, which starts today, urges people to press #Greece’s Prime Minister Mitsotakis to immediately release unaccompanied migrant children who are in detention, and to transfer them to safe, child-friendly facilities. https://t.co/D0xSRDS82I pic.twitter.com/c5nmqbhCc0 — Wenzel Michalski (@WenzelMichalski) April 14, 2020 Mitarachi told Athens city radio that 12 children would be relocated to Luxembourg on Wednesday and 50 to Germany on Saturday, AFP reported. Greece is host to about 100,000 asylum seekers, who stay mostly in camps, hotels and flats. There have been two coronavirus outbreaks in camps on the Greek mainland, forcing authorities to lock down both facilities. The worst congestion occurs in camps on five Aegean islands near Turkey where there are over 36,000 people for fewer than 6,100 places. Updated at 1.37pm BST 1.17pm BST Can you get coronavirus twice? A serious concern since the emergence of Covid-19 has been whether those who have had it can get it a second time – and what that means for exiting this crisis. In this video report, Hannah Devlin, the Guardian’s science correspondent, looks at how our bodies fight coronavirus when infected, how we develop immunity and if we can get reinfected with Covid-19 Updated at 1.34pm BST 1.07pm BST Sinn Féin leader tests positive for Covid-19 Mary Lou McDonald, the leader of Ireland’s Sinn Féin party, has tested positive for Covid-19. In a statement on Tuesday the 50-year-old said she was no longer deemed to be infectious, and hoped to return to work next week, writes Rory Carroll in Dublin. She was tested on 28 March and received the result on Monday, a two-week wait reflecting delays and glitches that have plagued testing in Ireland. “The Public Health Doctor informs me that I am no longer infected or infectious, and this is a great relief after weeks of being very unwell. I had a setback in my recovery at the weekend and developed post-viral pleurisy in my right lung. I am on medication and responding very well, and I fully expect to be back at work next Monday.” McDonald’s party won more votes than any other party in Ireland’s general election in February but has not managed to form a coalition government.

Spirits with an alcohol proof of between 70 and 83% can be substituted to sterilise hands under new rules set out in a health ministry document, obtained by AFP on Tuesday. Traditional Japanese drinks such as sake and shochu do not make the grade - at a maximum alcohol proof of roughly 22 and 45% respectively; but some sake makers have begun producing stronger alcohol products to meet the demand for sanitiser. Japan has reported 7,645 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and 109 deaths. Updated at 1.00pm BST 12.44pm BST Confirmed coronavirus cases in Africa pass 15,000 The World Health Organization has reported that the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Africa has now passed 15,000. An emergency shipment of medical supplies for African nations’ health systems departed Addis Ababa this morning. Although Covid-19 has yet to take hold across the continent, it is perhaps the most ill-equipped region of the world to tackle it. Last week the WHO’s Africa office estimated there were about five intensive care beds per million people in Africa, compared with about 4,000 per million people in Europe. (NB: A reader points out that this statistic seems unrealistic. A rough calculation suggested that Germany, for example, with 40,000 intensive care beds for a population of about 83million, has about 480 ICU spaces per million people. Given that Germany is one of the better-equipped countries in Europe, it is likely that others have far less.) Over 15,000 reported #COVID19 cases on the African continent.

Reuters reports him as saying Slovakia aims to protect the 70% of the economy that is running from being affected by the spread of the virus and that the reopening of retail will be cautious. The country has reported 835 cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and two deaths. Updated at 12.33pm BST 12.18pm BST The European commission is urging EU states to coordinate as they begin to ease lockdown measures, warning that failure to do so could result in new spikes of the coronavirus epidemic. Several EU states have announced plans or have already begun to relax restrictions imposed to contain the outbreak, as pressure grows to revive their battered economies. The EU executive arm, which has no power to dictate health measures to the 27 EU states, has repeatedly called for a common approach as the bloc’s members acted independently of each other in tackling the virus and are now proceeding in the same way in their exit strategies from lockdowns. In a draft set of recommendations, which it is expected to adopt this week, the commission said: It is time to develop a well-coordinated EU exit strategy. The exit strategy should be coordinated between the Member States, to avoid negative spillover effects. Updated at 12.30pm BST 12.10pm BST Maureen Zeman was a registered nurse for 29 years at a hospital in San Jose, California, before she was laid off with dozens of other nurses despite the coronavirus pandemic, reports Michael Sainato. Dozens of states across the US have issued orders to halt elective medical procedures as part of emergency shutdowns to curb the spread of Covid-19. As a result, hospitals and medical treatment clinics across the US are implementing layoffs, furloughs, and cuts to salaries and work schedules in response to declines in revenue. The for-profit company which owns the hospital where Zeman worked decided to shut down the maternal delivery department at the end of March, putting her and many others out of a job, and leaving patients with far fewer options. “They say it’s not related to Covid-19, but it’s a huge disservice to the women of the east side of San Jose. Doing this during a pandemic is terrible,” said Zeman. “They said it wasn’t financially stable to keep the unit open and so they’re closing. Our big concern is we’re a trauma center and there are no hospitals in this area that can take care of women and children’s services.” Related: US for-profit healthcare sector cuts thousands of jobs as pandemic rages 12.03pm BST Summary The global death toll neared 120,000 as cases passed 1.92 million.

So far, 119,687 people have died in the pandemic. France restrictions to ease in May. In a televised address, the French president said France would start returning to normal life on 11 May, if citizens were “civic, responsible and respected the rules” – and if the number of cases of coronavirus continued to drop. He said that only by respecting the confinement rules would the battle against Covid-19 be won. The country’s budget minister said its budget deficit was set to hit a post-war record of 9% of economic output this year. Brace for ‘extraordinary’ crisis, says Vladimir Putin. As Moscow tightened its lockdown measures, Russia reported its highest daily infection figures yet. In a video conference with officials on Monday, the country’s president said the next weeks would be “decisive” for Russia’s fight against the virus as the situation “is changing practically every day, and unfortunately not for the better.” China cases emerge on Russia border. China reported 89 new coronavirus cases on 13 April, down from 108 the previous day. China’s state broadcaster had reported earlier that 79 of the day’s imported cases were in the northeast province of Heilongjiang, which shares a border with Russia. Hubei province reported 0 new deaths and cases. Trump threatens to withdraw funding from WHO again. In a bizarre and antagonistic press briefing that included the airing of a campaign-style video attacking the press and Trump announcing his authority over lockdown rules is “total”, the US president said he will also decide this week whether he plans to reopen the US by 1 May.

A glimmer of hope. Deaths and hospitalisations are falling in New York. “Yes, I think you can say the worst is over,” said the state’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, announcing an alliance with six other governors in the region to explore how to lift restrictions. “If you do it wrong, it can backfire, and we’ve seen that with other places in the globe,” Cuomo said. England’s death toll at record levels. Coronavirus has pushed the death toll in England to its highest level since official weekly statistics began in 2005, with fatalities running at almost 40% above the average. The Office for National Statistics said that in the week to 3 April, 16,387 people died in England and Wales, an increase of 5,246 deaths compared with the previous week and 6,082 more than the five-year average.

Usually the busiest in Europe, the airport has forecast a huge fall in demand this month. The company said on Tuesday that passenger numbers were down 52% in March compared with the same period last year, with many of those journeys being made by Britons returning home from abroad. Updated at 12.44pm BST 11.49am BST French Ministers have added some details to fill out the broad brush strokes of Emmanuel Macron’s televised address yesterday evening, which was watched by an estimated 36.7 million people – more than half the French population. In the 30-minute broadcast, the president announced France would remain in strict lockdown until Monday 11 May when he said crêches, schools, colleges and lycées would “progressively” reopen. He called on people to be “civic, responsible and to respect the lockdown rules”.

Photograph: Marc Piasecki/Getty Images On Tuesday, interior minister, Christophe Castaner, stressed that the 11 May was not “a certainty but an objective”, while in a separate interview the education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, said not all education establishments would open their doors at 9am on 11 May as it would be “out of the question to have packed classrooms”. Following up on Macron’s promise to shake up the country’s health system, especially the wages and conditions for staff, the health minister, Olivier Véran, reiterated that there will be a complete overhaul of medical personnel salaries and working conditions when the coronavirus crisis is over. A fourth cabinet member, the economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, went on television to warn that the French economy will shrink by around 8% in 2020 as a result of the crisis. The French government is spending the next two weeks drawing up a “After Covid-19 Plan” to be announced in a fortnight. Updated at 11.58am BST 11.29am BST Belgian authorities have announced 4,157 people have now died from coronavirus, making the country among the worst affected in Europe. Deaths from coronavirus in Belgium exceeded the 4,000 mark with 262 new deaths confirmed in the last 24 hours, the National Crisis Centre reported in its daily briefing on Tuesday. Cases rose to 31,119, as testing was stepped up. The number of new patients admitted to hospital each day is continuing on a slow downward trend that has been evident since the end of March. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the number of deaths in Belgium is behind only Italy, Spain, France and the UK, all significantly more populous countries. Belgium, which has a population of 11.5m, has recorded more deaths than its neighbour the Netherlands, which has a population of 17.1 million and 2,727 deaths at the latest ECDC count. Comparisons are difficult as all countries are at different phases of the outbreak and calculate the death rate in varying ways. Belgium includes deaths in care homes, which so far account for 46% of all fatalities. Belgian authorities also include people suspected, but not confirmed, of having died from Covid 19. The country’s national security council is due to meet on Wednesday to discuss when to end the lockdown, following a report from an expert group. The francophone state broadcaster RTBF reported that the lockdown was likely to be extended until 3 May. The mayor of Brussels, Philippe Close, has called on the government to announce a date for ending the lockdown. “It is not enough to ask people to deprive themselves of their individual freedoms without telling them ‘we will come back to you and explain the next step,’” he said. He also said people could forget about any mass events before the end of June. Employees pose for a photo wearing face masks at a care home in Brussels.

The Office for National Statistics said that in the week to 3 April, 16,387 people died in England and Wales, an increase of 5,246 deaths compared with the previous week and 6,082 more than the five-year average, reports Robert Booth. The figures also showed the increasing impact of Covid-19 on mortality in England and Wales with 22% of all deaths relating to the disease in the week ending 3 April compared to 5% in the week ending 27 March. In London, nearly half of deaths registered involved Covid-19 and the West Midlands also suffered one of the high proportions of Covid-19 deaths, accounting for 22.1% of all deaths registered in the region. Related: Coronavirus pushes England and Wales death rate to record high Updated at 11.25am BST 11.02am BST Coronavirus deaths in Spain rose slightly over the past 24 hours to 567, compared to 510 yesterday, according the ministry of health. This brings the total number of deaths to 18,056, and the total number of recorded cases to 172,451. Businesses in the construction and manufacturing sectors tentatively reopened yesterday – a public holiday – after the Spanish government relaxed some lockdown measures put in place two weeks ago that confined most people to their homes. There have been no reports of crowded buses and trains. The Barcelona transport authority said there had been increased passenger traffic but still fewer than on 24 March, the last normal Tuesday before the full lockdown was enforced. Meanwhile, the health ministry has taken control of all private laboratories and clinics to accelerate the process of testing and has introduced measures to avoid abusive pricing of tests. Many furloughed employees have been unable to collect their benefits as unemployment offices struggle to cope with the huge number of claimants. Carmen Calvo, the vice-president, and Fernando Simón, the chief medical officer, both returned to work today after recovering from Covid-19.

Photograph: Ely Pineiro/Getty Images 10.50am BST Positive news from leading public health body in Germany, the Robert Koch Institute, whose head, Lothar Wieler has said the country’s attempts to control the virus’ spread are showing “positive tendencies”. “We cannot yet talk of a containment, but of a slowing down,” Wieler said in his first briefing since the Easter break. According to figures from health ministries across Germany, there are just over 130,000 confirmed infections in Germany, and there have been 3,246 deaths. The reproduction rate is currently 1.2 and the aim is to get this under one. Germany’s coronavirus mortality rate is 2.4% and will increase as more elderly people become infected, Wieler said. But he said if the development of the virus in Germany continues in a similar way, hospitals are not in danger of being overburdened. “It is good to see that the efforts being made are showing positive results,” Wieler said. He appealed to Germans to continue following the hygiene regulations as well as keeping their distance, saying these remained the two most crucial ways to dampen the virus’ spread. He added that in Germany the average age of those infected was 49, and a cough, temperature, blocked nose and loss of taste and smell remained the most commonly reported symptoms. In 2% of cases people developed pneumonia he said, while 16% of cases ended up in hospital. On Monday, the Academy of Sciences, Leopoldina released a long-awaited study in which it recommended a staggered return to normal life starting with schools reopening. Angela Merkel has said the study’s results would be an “influential resource” in her government’s decision as to when and how the current lockdown might be relaxed. Merkel is due to meet with the leaders of Germany’s 16 states tomorrow after which a decision is expected to be made as to Germany’s way forward. 10.45am BST The Philippines has introduced a more aggressive testing programme for the coronavirus to locate what it said could be as many as 15,000 unknown infections. The country has implemented some of Asia’s strictest and earliest lockdown measures, reports Reuters. Covid-19 has so far infected 5,223 people locally and killed 335. Authorities are to start the new programme of ramped-up testing on Tuesday with 8,000 people working at or admitted to Manila hospitals that were treating patients with the virus. Although the Philippines has Southeast Asia’s highest number of coronavirus infections and nearly 40% of its known fatalities, the government believes its swift move to close borders and put half its population under home quarantine may have averted a far greater toll and a healthcare disaster. The former military chief in charge of the national coronavirus task force said on Tuesday that modelling suggested 75% of infections - or 15,000 people - had yet to be detected. Carlito Galvez said: Our strategy is Metro Manila first because this is the epicentre. When we test Manila, we can win this battle against Covid. 10.38am BST The Tour de France will not begin as originally planned because French President Emmanuel Macron has cancelled all public events with large crowds until mid-July in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Tour organisers say it is now impossible for the three-week race to start on 27 June in the Riviera city of Nice as scheduled. It is unclear if cycling’s biggest event will be scrapped from the race calendar. Related: Tour de France on hold after Macron extends outdoor sports ban till July 10.16am BST Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his chief rival have met in a final effort to finalise an agreement on an emergency government that would tackle the coronavirus threat and prevent yet another costly and divisive election amid the crisis. Reuters reports that the meeting between Netanyahu and former military chief Benny Gantz followed an overnight session in which the two asked for, and received, a deadline extension from President Reuven Rivlin to try to complete the talks. Should the pair fail to reach agreement, the clock will start ticking toward the dissolution of parliament and a possible, yet still seemingly improbable, fourth election in just over a year. Last month’s election, just like the previous two, ended with no clear winner. Gantz repeatedly vowed not to sit in government with Netanyahu because of the criminal corruption charges against the prime minister. But with the virus crisis worsening, and his own shaky alliance fraying, Gantz made an about-face late last month and accepted an offer from Netanyahu to pursue a joint government to deal with the pandemic. Israel has reported over 11,800 cases and at least 117 deaths from the outbreak, which has paralysed the economy, shuttered Israelis in their homes and driven unemployment to record highs.

As increasing numbers of doctors and nurses fall ill or are quarantined, the shortage of medical staff is putting pressure on a usually well-resourced health service. Government initiatives have already increased the number of intensive care beds from around 24,000 to 40,000, most of them with ventilators. Staff are being retrained and non-essential operations across the country have been cancelled. But the health system still needs more medical personnel to care for patients, increase the levels of testing, and track down people who have been in contact with those who are sick. Match4Healthcare, a website backed by medical authorities which was created by a volunteer team of students and hackers, seeks to match healthcare workers and volunteers – both citizens and foreigners living in Germany – to clinics and care homes needing support.

The termination of Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, who worked as user-experience designers in Seattle, came a couple of weeks after the company fired another employee, Christian Smalls, for raising health and safety concerns for people labouring through the outbreak. The Seattle-based firm has been facing public scrutiny over safety and working conditions of warehouse, delivery and retail gig workers in the United States after cases of Covid-19 were reported in some of its facilities. Amazon workers have also protested in other countries. Amazon said it supported “every employee’s right to criticize their employer’s working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies”. 9.00am BST More than 100 academics, parliamentarians and public figures from across Europe and Australia have signed an open letter criticising the role of China’s government in the global pandemic, saying the current crisis affecting the world “has been caused by the regime so many of you have been tolerating and supporting for decades”. China has faced continued hostility and skepticism over its virus response, in particular because of its suppression of information at the beginning of the outbreak, and the punishment of health workers who sought to warn colleagues of the new virus in December. The already tense relationship between the US and China has worsened, as each government sought to blame the other for the outbreak – including unfounded allegations about deliberate production of the virus. The pandemic has also fuelled hostilities with Taiwan, which has been left out of the World Health Organisation’s response, and with African nations whose citizens have been subject to discrimination in Guangzhou. “We should never forget that China’s Chernobyl moment was a self-inflicted wound,” reads the letter, published on Tuesday in the Hong Kong Free Press. The global pandemic forces us all to confront an inconvenient truth: by politicising all aspects of life including people’s health, continued autocratic one-party rule in the People’s Republic of China has endangered everyone. Rather than trusting the CCP’s intentions and accepting establishment academics’ uncritical approval of the party-state’s policies, we should pay greater attention to the voices of what can be termed ‘unofficial’ China. These independent-minded academics, doctors, entrepreneurs, citizen journalists, public interest lawyers and young students no longer accept the CCP’s rule by fear. Neither should you. 8.59am BST Afghanistan prepared for 'worst case scenario' Afghan’s health minister has said the country is prepared for the worst case scenario, as the number of confirmed cases reached 714 amid a surge of infection in Kabul and Kandahar. 49 new Coronavirus cases were recorded in last 24 hours in the war-torn country, 18 of which were confirmed in the capital Kabul, taking the total number of infections to 178. Two Covid-19 patients died in the same period, bringing the total number of deaths to 23. There have been 40 recoveries. Kabul was put into full lockdown last week and all roads to the city of six million people were blocked. 1,600 police officers were appointed to monitor adherence to the new rules. The western province of Herat is the country’s worst affected area with 291 positive cases, including 41 health workers. 13 new cases have been confirmed in the southern province of Kandahar, pushing the total number of infections to 86.

Ferozuddin Feroz, said it would not be possible to test everyone, but that if people heeded hygiene advice “Coronavirus will be ended [in the] next two months”. He said the historic Darlaman palace would become a field hospital in coming days. Feroz asked all health workers to join the government’s fight against the virus and promised to increase salaries of current employees as well as reduce their working hours.

In an opening speech, the country’s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, said it is in these grim hours that the solidarity of the ASEAN community “shines like a beacon in the dark”. He said containment efforts have placed the pandemic under control, but warned against complacency, with a number of member countries, including Indonesia and the Philippines, fearing spikes in infections after large-scale testing is conducted. Founded in 1967 in the Cold War era, ASEAN – a diverse bloc representing more than 640m – people has held annual summits of its leaders and top diplomats with ceremonies steeped in tradition, protocol and photo-ops. Derided as a talk shop by critics, the bloc is known largely for photographs of its leaders locking arms at annual meetings in a show of unity despite often-thorny differences. All of ASEAN’s member states have been hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with the total number of confirmed cases reaching more than 20,400, including over 840 deaths, despite massive lockdowns, travel restrictions and home quarantines. 7.27am BST Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Frances Perraudin, in London. I’ll be bringing you the latest updates on the crisis for the next few hours. You can contact me directly on Twitter (@fperraudin) with tips, questions and comments, and I’ll do my best to respond. 7.08am BST That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan. With you for the next few hours is my colleague Frances Perraudin. If you’re just waking up or checking in, it’s worth (at the very least in case you were under the impression it things couldn’t get weirder) watching this video of US president Donald Trump’s White House press briefing meltdown on Monday evening in Washington: 7.06am BST Summary The global death toll neared 120,000 as cases passed 1.92 million. According to Johns Hopkins University figures, 1,920,985 people worldwide are known to have been infected with coronavirus, though the total number of infections is likely higher. So far, 119,687 people have died in the pandemic. France restrictions to ease in May. In a televised address, the French president said France would start returning to normal life on 11 May, if citizens were “civic, responsible and respected the rules” – and if the number of cases of coronavirus continued to drop. He said that only by respecting the confinement rules would the battle against Covid-19 be won. Brace for ‘extraordinary’ crisis, says Putin. As Moscow tightened its lockdown measures, Russia reported its highest daily infection figures yet. In a video conference with officials on Monday, Putin said the next weeks would be “decisive” for Russia’s fight against the virus as the situation “is changing practically every day, and unfortunately not for the better.” China cases emerge on Russia border. China reported 89 new coronavirus cases on 13 April, down from 108 the previous day. China’s state broadcaster had reported earlier that 79 of the day’s imported cases were in the northeast province of Heilongjiang, which shares a border with Russia. Hubei province reported 0 new deaths and cases. Trump threatens to withdraw funding from WHO again. In a bizarre and antagonistic press briefing that included the airing of a campaign-style video attacking the press and Trump announcing his authority over lockdown rules is “total”, the US president said he will also decide this week whether he plans to reopen the US by 1 May. Payments to individuals as part of the US economic stimulus package will be made by Wednesday, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. Hospitalisations in New York start to plateau. A glimmer of hope. Deaths and hospitalisations are falling in New York. “Yes, I think you can say the worst is over,” governor Andrew Cuomo said, announcing an alliance with six other governors in the region to explore how to lift restrictions. “If you do it wrong, it can backfire, and we’ve seen that with other places in the globe,” Cuomo said. Japan reports 390 new cases. Monday’s new cases were lower than the 530 new cases reported by the health ministry on Sunday. The country’s total is 7,645.

Poland has 6,934 confirmed cases and 245 deaths according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. 6.55am BST India extends nationwide lockdown to 3 May In a televised address on Tuesday morning, prime minister Narendra Modi announced that India’s nationwide lockdown is to be extended till 3 May. The lockdown in India, imposed on its population of 1.3bn people, is the largest of its kind anywhere in the world and has been the cause of enormous amounts of human suffering since it was first introduced at midnight on 24 March. India’s millions of migrant workers, and the 300 million people who fall below the poverty line and live a hand-to-mouth existence, have struggled without being able to work and travel and it has led to many finding themselves without food. A spray machine is used to sanitize a locality in New Delhi, India, 13 April 2020. Photograph: EPA In his speech, Modi thanked people for being “disciplined soldiers” and said that it was “now clear that the road we have taken is the right one”. Over the past 24 hours, the number of coronavirus cases in India reached 10,000, with the death toll currently at 339. Modi’s speech also emphasised his belief that India had tackled the spread of coronavirus more proactively and successfully than many countries in the west. “Compared to developed countries across the world, India is in a much better position,” he said. Modi also announced that from 20 April the lockdown would be eased in a few select areas which had no risk of becoming hotspots for the virus, but that they would be determined on a case by case basis. 6.50am BST Human Rights Watch is today launching a campaign demanding that the Greek government free unaccompanied migrant children “from police cells and detention centres” because of the heightened risk of exposure to coronavirus. The campaign, running under the hashtag #FreetheKids, urges people to call on Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis to release the minors and transfer them to safe, child-friendly facilities. 1 \\ The campaign to #FreeTheKids, which starts today, urges people to press #Greece’s Prime Minister Mitsotakis to immediately release unaccompanied migrant children who are in detention, and to transfer them to safe, child-friendly facilities. https://t.co/D0xSRDS82I pic.twitter.com/c5nmqbhCc0 — Wenzel Michalski (@WenzelMichalski) April 14, 2020 “Keeping children locked up in filthy police cells was always wrong, but now it also exposes them to the risk of COVID-19 infection,” said Eva Cosse, Greece researcher at the US-based group. “The Greek government has a duty to end this abusive practice and make sure these vulnerable kids get the care and protection they need.” The organisation launched the initiative after what it described as “years of research and advocacy” on the country’s practice of detaining and locking up children, with no immediate access to a parent or relative, in police cells and detention centres. Greece: Free Unaccompanied Migrant Children https://t.co/chnePLsN0V — Human Rights Watch (@hrw) April 14, 2020 Citing figures released from the state-run National Centre for Social solidarity, it says that as of March 31, some 331 minors were in police custody awaiting transfer to a shelter, almost twice the number who were in detention in January. According to the group, Greek authorities argue they place unaccompanied children - many who have made perilous journeys to get to Greece - in detention under a form of “protective custody regime” that is in the child’s best interest. HRW claims the facilities are not only inappropriate but overcrowded and highly unhygienic and, as such, provide fertile ground for a Covid-19 outbreak.

Photograph: Luong Thai Linh/EPA 6.27am BST How coronavirus almost brought down the global financial system In the third week of March, while most of our minds were fixed on surging coronavirus death rates and the apocalyptic scenes in hospital wards, global financial markets came as close to a collapse as they have since September 2008. The price of shares in the world’s major corporations plunged. The value of the dollar surged against every currency in the world, squeezing debtors everywhere from Indonesia to Mexico. Trillion-dollar markets for government debt, the basic foundation of the financial system, lurched up and down in terror-stricken cycles. On the terminal screens, interest rates danced. Traders hunched over improvised home workstations – known in the new slang of March 2020 as “Rona rigs” – screaming with frustration as sluggish home wifi systems dragged behind the movement of the markets. At the low point on 23 March, $26tn had been wiped off the value of global equity markets, inflicting huge losses both on the fortunate few who own shares, and on the collective pools of savings held by pension and insurance funds. What the markets were reacting to was an unthinkable turn of events. After a fatal period of hesitation, governments around the world were ordering comprehensive lockdowns to contain a lethal pandemic. Built for growth, the global economic machine was being brought to a screeching halt. In 2020, for the first time since the second world war, production around the world will contract. It is now clear that we can, if circumstances demand, turn the economy off. But the consequences are catastrophic. Related: How coronavirus almost brought down the global financial system 6.18am BST Global Covid-19 cases near 2 million as Putin warns Russia faces ‘extraordinary’ crisis The number of Covid-19 cases recorded worldwide is nearing 2 million, as Vladimir Putin warned warned officials to brace for “complex and extraordinary” scenarios in Russia as a result of the outbreak. The country reported 2,558 new cases on Monday, its highest daily figure yet, as officials tightened lockdown restrictions in Moscow. The overall nationwide tally is 18,328 and the death toll is 148. Putin told officials in a video conference the situation was “changing practically every day, and unfortunately not for the better” and Russia’s next few weeks would be “decisive”. China has also voiced concern about spread of the virus in Russia. While China’s daily reported infection rate remains far below its peak during the pandemic, the majority of new cases have been in regions bordering its northern neighbour. The area has become the new focus of containment measures, with some lockdown measures brought in for the cities of Hubin and Suifenhe. “Russia is the latest example of a failure to control imported cases and can serve as a warning to others,” said the state-owned English-language Global Times in an editorial. “The Chinese people have watched Russia become a severely affected country … This should sound the alarm: China must strictly prevent the inflow of cases and avoid a second outbreak.” Related: Global Covid-19 cases near 2 million as Putin warns Russia faces 'extraordinary' crisis 5.55am BST In New Zealand, new modelling from the Treasury has painted a dire picture of the country’s economic prospects for the next year, with a surge in unemployment to as much as 13% even if Covid-19 infections are contained and lockdown rules eased after the initial four weeks. A jobless rate of up to 26% – and a fall in GDP of 23% – is predicted if the country is forced to remain in its strictest level of shutdown for a total of six months before moving to marginally lighter measures. However, with a larger fiscal stimulus package than the NZ$20bn (£9.7bn) already pledged by the government, the 13% jobless rate modelled could hit a much lower peak of 8.5% before falling to 5.5% in the year to June 2021. On Tuesday, Robertson pledged to release further support. All seven of the scenarios modelled – the first released since the pandemic reached New Zealand – predicted that unemployment would be higher in the June quarter of this year than the 6.7% reached during the 2008 global financial crisis. The current jobless rate is just over 4%. Related: New Zealand jobless rate could hit 13% even if lockdown ends next week, modelling suggests 5.41am BST Summary The confirmed global death toll passed 119,687, and at least 1.92 million people have been infected, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The tallies are likely to be underestimates. The majority of new cases in China are in a province bordering Russia. China reported 89 new coronavirus cases on April 13, down from 108 the previous day. China’s state broadcaster had reported earlier that 79 of the day’s imported cases were in the northeast province of Heilongjiang, which shares a border with Russia. Hubei province reported 0 new deaths and cases. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday warned officials to brace for an “extraordinary” virus crisis as Moscow tightened its lockdown measures and Russia reported its highest daily infection figures yet, AFP reports. US president Donald Trump said we’ll know in the next few days whether he wants to reopen by 1 May, and also whether he plans to continue funding the World Health Organization. Payments to individuals as part of the US economic stimulus package will be made by Wednesday this week. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said “I think you can say the worst is over,” as the number of coronavirus hospitalisations in the state starts to plateau. The US is nearing the peak of its outbreak, according to the director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Robert Redfield, who told NBC: “You’ll know when you’re at the peak when the next day is actually less than the day before. We are stabilising right now.” The International Monetary Fund said on Monday it would provide immediate debt relief to 25 member countries under its Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT) to allow them to focus more financial resources on fighting the coronavirus pandemic Japan’s health ministry has reported 390 new coronavirus cases, for a domestic total of 7,645. The country was put under a state of emergency last week, but many people were still seen queuing up at grocery stores and crowding shopping arcades in parts of downtown Tokyo. Japan’s health ministry reported 530 new cases and four deaths on Sunday. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, says crèches and schools will begin to reopen on 11 May. That date will mark the start of a new phase, he said, but the lockdown will continue until then. German experts recommended a gradual relaxing of restrictions, as long as new infections stabilise and hygiene measures to control the spread of the virus are maintained. The head of the World Health Organization urged caution over moves to lift lockdown conditions. He said much was still unknown about the virus and that finding, testing and isolating cases was still crucial. The UK will not ease lockdown this week, said to the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who added that it was “still far too early”, and that the UK would be getting ahead of itself if ministers relaxed restrictions before medical experts advised them to.

Governments in at least 25 countries are employing vast programmes for mobile data tracking, apps to record personal contact with others, CCTV networks equipped with facial recognition, permission schemes to go outside and drones to enforce social isolation regimes. The methods have been adopted by authoritarian states and democracies alike and have opened lucrative new markets for companies that extract, sell, and analyse private data.

Nikos Hardalias, the civil defence minister, invariably follows, invoking the gravity of the situation with warnings that Greeks “must stay at home”. The bookish professor and no-nonsense former mayor are the faces who have come to be associated with the government’s drive to contain the spread of Covid-19. Their efforts at keeping the country virus-safe appear to be paying off: in a population of just over 11 million, there were, as of Monday, 2,145 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 99 deaths, far lower than elsewhere in Europe.

In this March 18, 2019 file photo, Brazil’s Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta, right, gives anti-bacterial gel to President Jair Bolsonaro. Photograph: Andre Borges/AP The public battle between a president notorious for his polarising remarks and the more measured doctor has reminded many of a similar tug of war taking place in the United States, between President Donald Trump and his chief virus expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci. It has also raised concerns that efforts to prevent the spread of the virus in Latin America’s largest country could veer off track. In a televised interview earlier this month, Bolsonaro said Mandetta had failed to show humility and that anyone can be fired. A few days later, Bolsonaro told a group of supporters that he would use his pen against officials in his government who are full of themselves. Those comments were widely understood as signaling an end to Mandetta’s tenure, so much so that the minister said his subordinates cleaned out his desk. But asked about the possibility of resigning recently, Mandetta said he learned from his teachers that a doctor never abandons his patient. 5.00am BST According to Washington Post journalist Robert Klemko, March this year was the first month in the US since 2002 without a school shooting.

More than half of the planet’s population is currently staying home as part of efforts to stem the spread of the virus, but Tedros warned that while COVID-19 had accelerated quickly, “it decelerates much more slowly.” “In other words, the way down is much slower than the way up,” he said. WHO said that “ultimately, the development and delivery of a safe and effective vaccine will be needed to fully interrupt transmission”. A vaccine is thought to be at least 12 to 18 months away. 4.43am BST In Mexico, health workers briefly blocked a street in Mexico City on Monday to demand more protective gear as their hospital receives more patients suffering from Covid-19, AP reports.

The deadline for finishing the head count also had been pushed back from the end of July to mid-August because of the pandemic. 3.56am BST Here’s some more from China, where Russia is being blamed for new infections inside the country. Russia has become China’s largest source of imported cases, with a total of 409 infections originating in the country, and Chinese citizens should stay put and not return home, the state-owned Global Times said in an editorial. “Russia is the latest example of a failure to control imported cases and can serve as a warning to others,” said the paper, which is run by the Communist Party’s People’s Daily. “The Chinese people have watched Russia become a severely affected country ... This should sound the alarm: China must strictly prevent the inflow of cases and avoid a second outbreak.” China’s northeastern border province of Heilongjiang saw 79 new cases of imported coronavirus cases on Monday. All the new cases were Chinese citizens travelling back into the country from Russia, state media said on Tuesday. They formed the bulk of new cases on the Chinese mainland, which stood at 89. 3.45am BST Here is US President Donald Trump at the White House press briefing earlier playing a campaign-style video attacking the media.

Ben Doherty and Charlotte Graham-McLay report: Australia’s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy has told a NZ parliamentary committee that the dinner party attended by healthcare workers was the origin of a cluster of new cases in the state. But the state’s premier, Peter Gutwein, said the chief medical officer “was commenting on a rumour”, and no dinner party had been identified as a possible source of infection. The cluster of more than 60 cases has caused a spike in Tasmania’s previously low number of infections, and forced about 5,000 people into the country’s strictest lockdown, as well as the emergency closure of two hospitals. So far more than 60 cases of Covid-19 have been linked to the outbreak, including at least 45 medical workers and nine patients.

Unfortunately he was 73 years old, wearing a long red tie and running the world’s most powerful country. Donald Trump, starved of campaign rallies, Mar-a-Lago weekends and golf, and goaded by a bombshell newspaper report, couldn’t take it any more. Years of accreted grievance and resentment towards the media came gushing out in a torrent. He ranted, he raved, he melted down and he blew up the internet with one of the most jaw-dropping performances of his presidency. This was, as he likes to put it, “a 10”. Trump’s Easter had evidently been ruined by a damning 5,500-word New York Times investigation showing that Trump squandered precious time in January and February as numerous government figures were sounding the alarm about the coronavirus. With more than 23,000 American lives lost in such circumstances, some presidents might now be considering resignation. Not Trump. He arrived in the west wing briefing room determined to tell the world, or at least his base, that he was not to blame. Instead it was a new and bloody phase of his war against “enemy of the people” – the media. Families grieving loved ones lost to the virus were in for cold comfort here.

The CMO Brendan Murphy told a New Zealand health committee this morning they needed to keep a lid on the virus infections, telling them We thought we were doing really well then in the last week we had a cluster of 49 cases in a hospital in Tasmania just over the weekend. Most of them went to an illegal dinner party of medical workers.” Then not half an hour later, the Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, said the CMO had been commenting “on a rumour”. I spoke to Brendan Murphy, a short while ago. To be frank, Brendan was commenting on a rumour. At this stage, there has... our contact tracing has not identified a dinner party of health workers. However, I accept that this is a serious allegation, and it’s something that needs to be followed up, and so we will retrace our steps, but, importantly, I’ve asked the Tasmania Police to investigate this matter, and that will be started today. We need to get on top of this. So Tasmania will investigate whether or not there was a dinner party, as it tries to work out the origins of the north-west outbreak, which has caused two hospitals to close and put just under 5000 people into a strict lockdown. 2.31am BST First sailor dies from Covid-19 and 600 test positive after outbreak on USS Theodore Roosevelt The death of the first US active duty military member comes 11 days after captain was fired for voicing concerns over safety of his crew on ship off Guam. A member of the crew of the coronavirus-infected USS Theodore Roosevelt has died of complications related to the disease, 11 days after the aircraft carrier’s captain was fired for pressing his concern that the US navy had done too little to safeguard his crew.

As former vice-president Joe Biden scored a widely expected win in the Wisconsin Democratic presidential primary, a liberal challenger for a state supreme court seat declared victory in an upset hailed by Democrats as boding well for the presidential election in November. The state supreme court is expected to rule in numerous voting rights cases in the lead-up to the presidential election, including a case in which 200,000 voters could be purged from voter rolls. Wisconsin is a swing state that narrowly voted for Donald Trump in 2016. Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, had held a large lead in polls before the vote was held. His main opponent, Bernie Sanders, dropped out of the presidential nominating race the day after the vote. Sanders endorsed Biden’s candidacy in a video chat on Monday. The results from Wisconsin on Monday were drawn from election day the previous Tuesday, which was marred by long lines of voters forced to go to the polls in person as coronavirus ravaged the country. Coronavirus fears led to an unprecedented number of requests for absentee ballots in the state, numbering more than 1m, but many voters reported that they had not received ballots by election day.

The figure listed on their website briefly showed that there were more than two million confirmed cases worldwide. This has now been revised down to 1,918,855. We’ll keep a close eye on it throughout the day – no word yet from Johns Hopkins on what the reason behind this was. 2.00am BST In Australia, mind-melting news from the Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy now. According to Sky News New Zealand correspondent Jackson Williams, Professor Murphy has said Australia needed to be prepared for “further outbreaks”. Why? Because of an illegal dinner party.

A woman rides a bicycle in front of the fence with the graffiti reading “quarantine’ in Minsk, Belarus, Monday, April 6, 2020. Photograph: Sergei Grits/AP It was the latest show of defiance by the strongman leader, who has dismissed worries about the disease as a “psychosis” and variously suggested drinking vodka, going to saunas and driving tractors to fight the virus, Reuters reports. Belarus has kept its borders open and even allowed soccer matches in the national league to be played in front of spectators. Its churches have also remained open in the run-up to Orthodox Easter on 19 April. “No one will die of coronavirus in our country. I publicly declare this,” Lukashenko said. “We have already found combinations of drugs to save people.” The health ministry has reported 2,919 confirmed coronavirus cases and 29 deaths in Belarus. But Lukashenko said the fatalities were the result of underlying health conditions in the patients, such as heart disease and diabetes. “Therefore, I say that not a single person died purely from the coronavirus.” 1.26am BST Putin warns Russia to prepare for ‘extraordinary’ virus crisis Two Russian police officers, wearing face masks to protect from coronavirus, patrol empty Manezhnaya Square near Red Square to ensure a self-isolation regime due to coronavirus, in Moscow, Russia, Monday, 13 April 2020. Photograph: Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday warned officials to brace for “extraordinary” scenarios in the coronavirus pandemic as Moscow tightened its lockdown measures and Russia reported its highest daily infection figures yet, AFP reports. Russia reported 2,558 new cases on Monday, bringing the overall nationwide tally to 18,328. Eighteen people diagnosed with the virus died overnight, pushing the death toll to 148. Though rising, the number of deaths remains much lower for now than in countries such as the United States and Italy. In a video conference with officials on Monday, Putin said the next weeks would be “decisive” for Russia’s fight against the virus as the situation “is changing practically every day, and unfortunately not for the better.” He told officials that they need to “consider all scenarios for how the situation will develop, even the most complex and extraordinary.” In the video conference, Putin called for measures to end shortages of protective equipment for medics. “I know there’s not always enough of that and of course here we need additional measures to get rid of all these shortages,” the president said. He added that Russia would also bring in the defence ministry to help if necessary. Updated at 1.27am BST 1.22am BST And before we move onto news from the rest of the world, a reminder that about half an hour into that White House briefing, Trump had yet to provide any updates on the crisis in the US.

Here are the main points: US president Donald Trump will decide whether to continue funding the WHO and whether to reopen the economy on 1 May in the next few days, he said. “I have the ultimate authority” to re-open the country and scale back distancing measures, Trump claimed. This is not true. Payments to individuals as part of the US economic stimulus package will be made by Wednesday this week, said US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The US has significantly ramped up testing in recent days. “In three weeks, we went from 300,000 tests to 3m tests,” said Dr. Deborah Birx. In other US news: Bernie Sanders endorsed Joe Biden’s bid for president. The announcement comes five days after Sanders withdrew from the Democratic primary, and the former candidate told his supporters today, “We’ve got to make Trump a one-term president.” 1.07am BST Dr Deborah Birx noted earlier that the US has significantly ramped up testing in recent days. “In three weeks, we went from 300,000 tests to 3m tests,” she said. “We know that we have to further increase that.” A team is mapping the testing capacity is across the country, she added. 1.06am BST The White House Press Briefing is ongoing, with Dr Anthony Fauci – the country’s leading infectious diseases expert and a key member of the US coronavirus task force – speaking now. “I can tell you one thing he’s going to listen. But I think what’s going to happen is he’s going to get input from a number of experts. One of them is health.” Dr. Fauci is speaking following a retweet by US president Trump that included the hashtag #FireFauci, and is being asked bout Trump’s plans to possibly reopen the country by 1 May – Trump said earlier in the presser that he will know later this week whether that will happen. Trump also said earlier in the press briefing that he did not plan to fire the doctor. “When you have conversations with the president, sometimes they really have to be confidential,” Dr Fauci said when asked if he’s willing to publicly contradict Trump if he advocates for unsafe policies. “I’ll have to think about that,” Fauci said, adding that he’s confident the president will defer to public health experts’ guidance. Updated at 1.07am BST 1.00am BST Summary Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. As confirmed cases worldwide approach two million and deaths at more than 119,400, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is seeing “glimmers of hope” and has told the state that the “worst is over”. Later, in a freewheeling and aggressive press conference, even by his standards, US president Donald Trump repeatedly confronted journalists, calling one disgraceful, and saying another would be “the last to know” the answer to her question. Meanwhile Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned the country to prepare for an “extraordinary” virus crisis, saying the situation “is changing practically every day, and unfortunately not for the better.” I’ll be bringing you the latest for the next few hours. You can get in touch with me directly with news, tips, questions or comments on Twitter @helenrsullivan. The confirmed global death toll passed 119,483, and at least 1.9 million people have been infected, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The tallies are likely to be underestimates. US president Donald Trump said we’ll know in the next few days whether he wants to reopen by 1 May, and also whether he plans to continue funding the World Health Organization. Payments to individuals as part of the US economic stimulus package will be made by Wednesday this week. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said that with the number of coronavirus hospitalisations starting to plateau, that there were glimmers of hope. “Yes, I think you can say the worst is over,” he said. The US is nearing the peak of its outbreak, according to the director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Robert Redfield, who told NBC: “You’ll know when you’re at the peak when the next day is actually less than the day before. We are stabilising right now.” The US governors of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Delaware and Connecticut announced they had formed a regional advisory council. Each state will name a public health official and an economic development official to serve on a working group alongside each governor’s chief of staff to design a “reopening plan” for their states. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, says crèches and schools will begin to reopen on 11 May. That date will mark the start of a new phase. B, he said, but the lockdown will continue until then. The number of deaths from coronavirus in Italy passed 20,000 after they rose by 566 on Monday, 135 more than on Sunday. Almost half of the deaths (280) were registered in Lombardy, the northern region worst affected by the virus. A total of 11,329 patients have died in UK hospitals after testing positive for coronavirus, the UK’s Department of Health said, up by 717 in 24 hours. German experts recommended a gradual relaxing of restrictions, as long as new infections stabilise and hygiene measures to control the spread of the virus are maintained. The head of the World Health Organization urged caution over moves to lift lockdown conditions. He said much was still unknown about the virus and that finding, testing and isolating cases was still crucial. The UK will not ease lockdown this week, said to the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who added that it was “still far too early”, and that the UK would be getting ahead of itself if ministers relaxed restrictions before medical experts advised them to. Spain saw another fall in its overnight death toll, down by 102 to 517 in 24 hours, bringing the total to 17,489, the country’s health ministry said, adding that it was the smallest proportional daily increase since tracking began.","Id":"world/live/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-live-news-cases-worldwide-near-2-million-trump-repeats-who-funding-threat-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Italy sees lowest increase in Covid-19 infections for a month – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-live-news-cases-worldwide-near-2-million-trump-repeats-who-funding-threat-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-live-news-cases-worldwide-near-2-million-trump-repeats-who-funding-threat-latest-updates","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":20859,"webPublicationDate":"2020-04-14T23:46:53Z","id":"world/live/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-live-news-cases-worldwide-near-2-million-trump-repeats-who-funding-threat-latest-updates","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Coronavirus live news: G20 in global vaccine effort pledge; UK records 341 more deaths","body":"10.57pm GMT End of live blog That’s where we will leave the global coronavirus liveblog for Saturday.

The milestone marks a worsening of the country’s Covid-19 epidemic, which has claimed a quarter of a million lives across America, more than in any other nation. Reuters data shows the pace of new infections in the United States has quickened, with nearly one million more cases recorded in just the last six days since the country recorded 11 million. Updated at 10.06pm GMT 5.27pm GMT Turkey on Saturday reported its highest daily number of new coronavirus patients since the outbreak started. Figures from the health ministry showed that 5,532 people had been diagnosed with Covid-19 symptoms in the previous 24 hours. Since July, Ankara has only reported symptomatic cases of coronavirus, a move that critics say hides the true scale of the outbreak. The daily death toll from the coronavirus was 135, bringing the cumulative total to 12,219. To battle a surge in cases, Turkey this week introduced partial weekend curfews and limited the opening hours of restaurants, cafes and shopping malls.

She called for clarity about what economic support measures will accompany different types of restrictions after the lockdown ends. Speaking to the Co-operative party’s local government conference, Dodds said: It’s extraordinary that the lockdown is due to lift in just 11 days, and we still haven’t heard a peep from government as to what comes next. We need clarity about what economic support package will go alongside different types of restrictions. We can’t go back to the shambles we had before this lockdown.

Another 400 staged a similar protest in the country’s second city, Aarhus. Mette Frederiksen’s government has acknowledged that its decision to cull more than 15 million minks had no legal basis for those not contaminated by the Covid-19 variant, infuriating breeders.

It sells pelts for around 670m euros ($792m) annually, and is the second-biggest producer worldwide, behind China. The mutated version of the new coronavirus detected in Danish minks that raised concerns about the effectiveness of a future vaccine has likely been eradicated, the health ministry said Thursday. “It is not fair what has happened to the breeders,” said Daniel, 19, a mink farm worker. “The entire sector will now have to shut down,” he added. Updated at 5.29pm GMT 3.02pm GMT A further 316 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths reported in hospitals to 38,112, NHS England said on Saturday. Patients were aged between 28 and 102. All except five, aged between 64 and 96, had known underlying health conditions. The deaths were between 3 June and 20 November. Twenty-two other deaths were reported with no positive Covid-19 test result. 2.57pm GMT Over in Greece officials are warning that lockdown restrictions are likely to continue beyond 30 November when the measures were initially meant to end, writes Helena Smith, the Guardian’s Athens correspondent. Although transmissions have gradually begun “to stabilise,” infectious disease experts say the decline in infection rates has been slower than expected. Speaking to Thema 104.6 FM radio today, leading epidemiologist Alkiviadis Vatopoulos who sits on the scientific committee that advises prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ centre right government, said: “The curve appears to be flattening, cases don’t seem to be increasing but this has happened very late in the lockdown to be honest. We were expecting it to occur earlier … the feeling is people haven’t taken [it] as seriously as they did [during the first lockdown] in March.” It was vital that Greeks remained on guard, he added, insisting that infection rates could “get out of control at any moment” again. Athenians exercising at night beneath the Acropolis. Photograph: Helena Smith/The Guardian Greece has seen a surge in confirmed transmissions especially in and around Thessaloniki, the country’s northern metropolis where hospitals are at breaking point. On Friday the National Organisation for Public Health announced a record 72 patients had died from Covid-19 raising the total number of fatalities to 1,419. A further 2,581 people had been diagnosed with the virus bringing the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases to 87,812. With the case load not being reduced adequately, government ministers are now saying next week will be critical in determining when, and if, curbs are lifted. Measures include a 9PM to 5 AM curfew, with citizens having to inform authorities of their movements via text before they venture outdoors. Exercise in groups of no more than three is allowed as is dog walking. “The response to the measures hasn’t produced enough yet in terms of lessening of cases so it’s best to re-evaluate the data again when the time comes,” said minister of state Giorgos Gerapetritis adding the coming days would be critical. Another minister contacted by the Guardian, echoing Gerapetritis, said the intention remained to open the country’s retail market ahead of Christmas “because commercially and economically December is such an important month” but emphasised that everything would depend on epidemiological data. 2.42pm GMT The US president, Donald Trump, said on Saturday that his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, is doing “very well” in quarantine after being infected with coronavirus, the Associated Press reports. “My son Donald is doing very well. Thank you!” Trump tweeted, following Friday’s disclosure that the 42-year-old Trump scion had become one of the nearly 12 million Americans infected by the virus. My son Donald is doing very well. Thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 21, 2020 Donald Trump Jr. learned of his positive test result earlier this week, has had no symptoms and was following all medically recommended guidelines for treating the illness, said a spokesperson, who was granted anonymity to discuss private medical information. 2.36pm GMT Police have imposed a dispersal zone in Liverpool, north west England, until midnight, as they attempt to clear the street of anti lockdown protesters. According to the Liverpool Echo, about 200 protesters were marching through the streets of the city on Saturday afternoon, chanting “freedom” as they were shepherded by police. Several arrests have been made, the Echo reports. DISPERSAL ZONE | We've introduced a Dispersal Zone in #Liverpool city centre from 11am-midnight today after a gathering last weekend breached coronavirus legislation. Officers will have a visible presence & deal with any unlawful gatherings.

Such gatherings in Liverpool in recent weeks have involved several hundred people showing a lack of social distancing with many not wearing face coverings, and last weekend we brought in a Section 34 dispersal zone to disperse an unlawful gathering that formed at the Bombed Out Church. We arrested a number of people on suspicion of breaching the dispersal zone after they had returned to the area, and investigations are ongoing. If people continue to gather unlawfully, we will not hesitate to take the same course of action. 1.48pm GMT Several thousand worshippers and clergy have paid their respects to the head of the Serbian Orthodox church, Patriarch Irinej, in a Belgrade church after he died aged 90 after contracting coronavirus. Irinej, who was born Miroslav Gavrilović, tested positive for Covid-19 on 4 November and died on Friday, prompting the Serbian government to declare three days of national mourning in the predominantly Orthodox Christian country. Some maintained tradition by kissing the glass-covered casket containing the patriarch’s body, which was dressed in a gold-embroidered robe and an ornate crown. Most, however, solemnly walked past it wearing protective masks as they paid their respects to Irinej, who was enthroned as the church’s 45th patriarch and spiritual leader of Eastern Orthodox Serbs a decade ago, Reuters reported.

Photograph: Vladimir Zivojinovic/Getty Images Updated at 1.56pm GMT 12.39pm GMT Tens of thousands of people in Pakistan defied a government ban on large gatherings on Saturday to attend the funeral of a hardline cleric in Lahore, according to Reuters. Khadim Hussain Rizvi, 54, died of a heart attack on Thursday, just days after leading a violent protest march to the capital, Islamabad, against the publication in France of cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad. With coronavirus infections rising, the government this month declared the country was experiencing a “second wave” of contagion and banned large events and meetings. Official data released on Saturday showed 2,843 people had tested positive for the virus and 42 had died in the last 24 hours – both figures the highest for a single day since July. Despite the coronavirus curbs, tens of thousands turned out to mourn Rizvi, and organisers of the funeral said the government had not told them to limit the gathering. Government officials did not respond to a request for comment about the funeral, which wreaked havoc in Lahore as mobile phone services were shut down and major roads blocked for security reasons. A local official, who asked not to be named, said he estimated that close to 200,000 people had attended the event. The gathering was so large that Rizvi’s coffin could not be carried through the crowd to the site set up for the ceremony, and had to be positioned on a nearby bridge for the prayers, said Reuters. Rizvi, known for his fiery sermons, headed the Tehreek-e Labbaik Pakistan party, which has pressured the government on a number of issues in recent years by denouncing alleged blasphemy and staging protests. Earlier this month, the cleric led a march of thousands of protesters to Islamabad that blocked a main entry road for hours and saw demonstrators clash with police. (Writing and additional reporting by Gibran Peshimam. Editing by Helen Popper) 12.06pm GMT A mass coronavirus testing pilot scheme has been launched today in Wales. Lisa Mytton, the deputy leader of Merthyr Tydfil county borough council, said she believed the mass testing pilot was the best way to try to reduce the area’s high levels of coronavirus transmissions. She told the PA news agency: I just wonder what other way there would be to do it apart from this way? I really am hopeful that it will get everybody out there so we can find and see those people who are asymptomatic, walking around unknowingly with coronavirus, so they can then self-isolate and we can reduce our transmission rate. This will help in the end; people being able to see relatives, to get back to some sort of normality. Obviously we didn’t want as many people having coronavirus in Merthyr Tydfil as the numbers have shown; that’s saddened us. But I’m pleased we’ve been chosen to undertake this pilot because if it helps reduce the transmission rate in Merthyr Tydfil then that’s a good thing, definitely.

Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA Updated at 12.17pm GMT 11.51am GMT Tougher restrictions have come into force in Iran, including closing non-essential businesses and restrictions on travel, in an effort to curb a third wave of coronavirus infections – as state media reported widespread flouting of the rules. “Tehran streets are crowded despite the restrictions,” state TV said on Saturday morning, according to Reuters. It said some non-essential businesses were open, but later showed mostly empty streets and shuttered shops. The semi-official ISNA news agency posted photos of crammed metro trains with the hashtag “coronavirus kills”. Other media sites posted photos of packed buses. People walk in the rain past closed shops along a street in Iran’s capital Tehran on Saturday. Photograph: AFP/Getty The deputy health minister, Alireza Raisi, said the 10% of people who ignore the health regulations could spread the virus to 80% of the population, adding that family gatherings were the main cause of infections. President Hassan Rouhani said in televised remarks on Saturday the two-week restrictions could be extended if the desired results were not achieved. Iran’s health ministry reported 431 Covid-19 deaths over the past 24 hours, taking the overall toll to 44,327. The ministry spokeswoman, Sima Sadat Lari, said total cases rose by 12,931 to 841,308. Updated at 12.05pm GMT 11.15am GMT The tally of coronavirus cases in the eastern European sub-region passed 5m on Saturday, according to a tally kept by Reuters. The region, which comprises Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Moldova, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, has the highest count of reported cases in Europe. They collectively reported over 82,000 cases in a single day on an average in the last week, while adding over 1,500 deaths daily on average. Russia, Poland, and Ukraine are among the top 20 countries with the most cases in the world. Europe has so far reported more than 15 million coronavirus cases, making it the region with the highest number of cases. It has recorded more than 346,000 deaths, the second-highest in the world by region after Latin America, according to a Reuters tally.

Photograph: AFP/Getty Images Updated at 11.33am GMT 10.49am GMT Poland’s prime minister has asked people in the country not to travel over Christmas, and announced that while shops would reopen most coronavirus restrictions would be extended. “Please do not plan any trips,” Mateusz Morawiecki said at a press conference, adding that the government was looking at ways of imposing movement restrictions, according to the AFP news agency. Morawiecki said theatres, bars and restaurants would remain closed until after Christmas, and schools would continue to be on distance learning. “The situation is still very serious,” he said, voicing concern about Poland’s high death rate but pointing out that the number of new cases had stabilised. The health ministry on Saturday reported 574 deaths over 24 hours, bringing the total toll to 13,288. The number of new daily infections in Poland was 24,213. The number of coronavirus-related deaths in Poland over the past week has been the third highest in the EU after Italy and France, according to an AFP tally. Updated at 11.32am GMT 10.14am GMT A planned travel bubble between Hong Kong and Singapore was scrapped a day before its launch on Saturday after the southern Chinese city announced a sudden spike in coronavirus cases, according to AFP. The two financial hubs have both suffered mild outbreaks. But with small populations and a heavy dependence on links to the outside world they have been hard hit as the global economy collapsed. Desperate to help their key tourism and aviation sectors, they came up with the plan allowing limited, quarantine-free travel between the cities as long as visitors test negative for Covid-19. The travel corridor was set to kick off on Sunday morning. But on Saturday, Hong Kong announced the scheme would have to be delayed for two weeks following a sudden rise in coronavirus infections. “In the light of recent surge of local cases we have decided, together with the Singapore government, to defer the air travel bubble’s launch by two weeks,” the commerce secretary, Edward Yau, told reporters. 10.03am GMT Hi folks! The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has used a video update from his self-isolation at Number 10 to urge people who are self-isolating to keep themselves socially distanced from those they live with. Hi folks, quick update from me. Still self-isolating and working from my office in Downing St, leading on our response to the pandemic. pic.twitter.com/jtgLwVCUaU — Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) November 21, 2020 Johnson has been self-isolating for six days after a meeting with Tory MP Lee Anderson, who later tested positive for coronavirus. Johnson said he wanted to “reach out” to other people forced to self-isolate. NHS Test and Trace, which is getting ever better, has achieved what so many of my political foes have wanted to achieve for many years, put me under house arrest. I know how frustrating it can be, so I just wanted to say to everybody else who is in my shoes, don’t forget that, of course, the isolation doesn’t necessarily apply to the people you share your home with - your partner can still go out shopping or whatever. Your housemates can still go out to exercise but you have got to make sure that you continue to observe social distancing from them. Your kids can obviously continue to go to school but you’ve got to make sure you observe social distancing from them and follow the basics: hands, face, space. And bear in mind what you are doing is incredibly important because that is how we are going to break the chain of transmission, stop the disease, get the R down - as I believe we are doing at the moment - and get in under control. Thank you very much everybody for what you are doing, and if you do find it a strain and you do feel under mental pressure because of what’s going on, then get onto the web and look at Every Mind Matters. Updated at 10.04am GMT 9.52am GMT The number deaths in the Czech Republic linked to coronavirus doubled in November and passed the 7,000 mark, health ministry data showed on Saturday, according to Reuters. Recorded fatalities reached 7,021 as of Saturday, compared with the 3,523 recorded by the end of October, according to the figures. According to the Worldometers website, the country has a rate of 655 coronavirus-related deaths per million inhabitants, and 45,495 infections per million. The country has experienced a fall in the number of new cases and patients sent to hospital in recent weeks, allowing the government to ease some curbs. The health ministry reported 5,809 new cases for Friday, less than half the peak numbers at the turn of October and November. The number of hospital admissions dropped to 6,307 compared with a peak of 8,283 recorded on 6 November. Updated at 10.51am GMT 9.46am GMT Temperatures have dropped in recent days in Turin, northern Italy, but that hasn’t prevented Anita Iacovelli from persevering in her protest against the closure of her school, writes Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian’s Rome correspondent. Every day since 6 November, when schools across the city and the wider Piedmont region were closed because of escalating coronavirus infections, the 12-year-old, wearing a hat, gloves and face mask, has sat outside Italo Calvino school and continued with her lessons remotely on a tablet computer. Behind her is a handwritten poster that reads: “Learning at school is our right.” Anita Iacovelli, left, and her friend Lisa Rogliatti, both 12, sit in front of the Italo Calvino school in Turin, Italy. Photograph: Marco Alpozzi/AP It began as a lone protest but Anita was soon joined by her friend Lisa Rogliatti and other classmates, before the initiative gathered momentum across Italy. It is not the most ideal way to study, but the children simply want to go back to class, having spent months cooped up indoors in front of computers during the first wave of the pandemic. “At the very beginning, when they announced that schools were closing, we were happy as we had weeks of tests coming up and so we thought we would skip them,” Anita told the Guardian. “But then it became extremely heavy and we got very tired.” Related: Italian children take lessons outside school in protest at Covid closures Updated at 11.04am GMT 9.37am GMT A €10bn (£8.9bn) support package has been approved in Italy to support businesses hit by the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, according to Reuters. Under the measures approved late on Friday, Rome will immediately offer €1.95bn in grants to coronavirus-hit businesses and food aid for poor people. The government is also preparing an additional €8bn to beef up aid schemes already in place. Italy’s economy is expected to contract by at least 9% this year because of lockdown measures aimed at reining in the epidemic. The new measures are not expected to push this year’s budget deficit above the current goal of 10.8% of gross domestic product, the treasury said, as there was already spending leeway built into the target. The government is planning to spend an additional €15-€20bn early next year to help the economy, which will push up the deficit in 2021, sources have said. On Friday, the health ministry reported 37,242 new coronavirus infections and 699 deaths, as the country struggles to curb a resurgence of cases and fatalities which are stretching its health service to breaking point. Updated at 11.05am GMT 9.29am GMT In the UK, a former chief government scientific advisor has expressed optimism at the prospect of an imminent vaccine for Covid-19, as he downplayed fears of side effects from the rapidly produced jabs. Prof Sir Mark Walport said he had complete confidence in the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to determine the safety of any vaccine. Unlike traditional vaccines, which contain deactivated or attenuated viruses, two frontrunners are based on novel biotechnology that tricks recipients’ own bodies into producing the spike proteins that surround the Sars-CoV-2 virus. Walport told Times Radio that the MHRA and other global regulatory agencies would take the job of approving any vaccine very seriously, despite pressure and demand for the new vaccines to be made available as soon as possible. They are very clear what their job is, they are independent of the government, they will look at the data in a rigorous fashion. The safety of the vaccine is very important, they will take it very seriously because we want a vaccine that works but we want one that is safe. There’s no reason to expect long-term side effects emerging. If there are going to be side effects there are the immediate ones. Updated at 9.41am GMT 9.07am GMT The Hungarian-born biochemist who helped pioneer the research behind the mRNA technology used in the two Covid-19 vaccines showing positive results believes it was always a no-brainer, writes Julia Kollewe. “I never doubted it would work,” Katalin Karikó told the Guardian. “I had seen the data from animal studies, and I was expecting it. I always wished that I would live long enough to see something that I’ve worked on be approved.” This month has been the pinnacle of Karikó’s lifelong work researching mRNA, or messenger ribonucleic acid. The 65-year-old, who left Hungary in 1985 to pursue an academic career in the US with her husband, toddler and just £900 hidden in a teddy bear, has now been suggested as a possible Nobel prize winner.

The country was hit by jumps in cases in late February-early March and August. A cheerleader performs during a baseball match between Doosan Bears and NC Dinos at Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul, South Korea. Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/AP Lim spoke after the KDCA reported reported 386 new daily coronavirus cases as of midnight on Friday, bringing total infections to 30,403, with 503 deaths. New cases topped 300 for the fourth day in a row, after Tuesday had the highest amount since August. The standard for imposing tougher social distancing measures was expected to be reached soon, Lim said. The daily national tally was expected to reach 400 new cases next week and more than 600 in early December if the current rate of one patient infecting 1.5 people was not curbed, she added. Because of recent infections spreading among college and private after-school tuition academies, she especially urged young people to refrain from meeting and to get tested early. Updated at 9.35am GMT 8.38am GMT Russia reports record new cases and deaths Russia reported a daily record of 24,822 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, including 7,168 in the capital Moscow, bringing the national tally to 2,064,748, Reuters said. Authorities also reported 467 coronavirus-related deaths in the last 24 hours, also a record, taking the official death toll to 35,778. 8.26am GMT It is too early to think about easing coronavirus restrictions in England, despite community transmission rates slowing, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, the representative body for hospitals in England, has said. Saffron Cordery told BBC Breakfast that a drop in infection rates in some part of the country hasn’t yet translated into a drop in hospital admissions. She said: There is a lag in the spread reducing in the community and it actually reducing in terms of hospital admissions, because when someone contracts coronavirus it would probably be 10 days to two weeks before they become a hospital admission. Cordery said the reproduction number – the R value – of coronavirus was reducing most sharply in the areas that had the strictest lockdown measures before the English national lockdown was imposed, but that increases had been seen in the south and south-west. I think it would be really tempting to say: ‘OK, this lockdown is working, let’s lift all restrictions on 2 December and go back to where we were,’ but I think that could put us in danger in terms both in controlling the spread of the virus and what it means for the NHS. Updated at 9.27am GMT 8.17am GMT Hullo. This is Damien Gayle in the hot seat in London for the live blog today, bringing you the latest coronavirus-related news and updates from the UK and around the world. If you have any comments, tips or suggestions for coverage, or you simply want to reach out from lockdown and say hi, then drop me a line, either via email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via Twitter DM to @damiengayle. 8.11am GMT So, to recap: The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the NHS could start vaccinating people against Covid-19 next month. Japan has reported a record 539 new coronavirus cases, the third day with more than 500 cases. The Japanese prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, has suspended a domestic travel campaign in areas with high case numbers. Ukraine has also recorded a new daily record, with 14,580 new cases in 24 hours. The Covid-19 death toll in Mexico has passed 100,000. In Australia, residents of South Australia will be allowed out of their homes from midnight, and Victoria is expected to ease rules mandating the use of face masks from Sunday. And the Victorian premier is “very confident” the Australian Open tennis tournament will go ahead early next year. With that I’ll pass over to Damien Gayle in London. Be well, and to my South Australian friends – try not to party too hard at midnight. Updated at 9.48am GMT 7.46am GMT Japan has announced that it will suspend a domestic travel campaign in areas where coronavirus cases are especially high. The prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, announced the change on Saturday afternoon. Updated at 7.56am GMT 7.34am GMT Ukraine reports a record 14,580 new cases Ukraine registered a record 14,580 new coronavirus infections in the last 24 hours, the health minister, Maksym Stepanov, said on Saturday, surpassing the previous day’s record of 14,575. The total tally climbed to 612,665 cases, with 10,813 deaths, Reuters reported. Updated at 7.56am GMT 7.16am GMT The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, is set to receive an Emmy award for his coronavirus briefings. The International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, one of the organisations that awards Emmys, said Cuomo’s award, the Founder’s award, is “in recognition of his leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic and his masterful use of television to inform and calm people around the world”. Prior recipients of the award include Oprah Winfrey and the former US vice-president Al Gore. Cuomo said on Friday that the recognition is “flattering” and that “it’s flattering for the people of [New York]”. He joked that reporters at the press conference “helped hone my presentation skills and acting skills”. In the early months of the pandemic, when New York City was the centre of the global pandemic, Cuomo’s popularity skyrocketed as people from around the country tuned into his blunt-talking daily televised press briefings. His approval ratings rose to 77% – a record in his nearly 10 years as governor – and he even developed a global following, especially by comparison to the chaotic briefings given by Donald Trump.

Mexico has now recorded 1,025,969 cases of Covid-19, with 6,426 new cases reported by the health ministry on Friday. Health officials have said that the real number is likely to be significantly higher than the official tally. 6.51am GMT The head of a medical research institute that is conducting the first clinical trial in Australia on whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent Covid-19 has been named Melburnian of the year. The director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Prof Doug Hilton, was named by the Melbourne lord mayor, Sally Capp, on Saturday: Prof Hilton leads WEHI, where researchers are using their expertise in infectious diseases and immunology to work on urgent research and treatments for Covid-19. This includes research into how immunity to Covid-19 develops, and antibody therapies that could block the virus from entering cells. Prof Hilton is a passionate advocate for health and medical research, diversity and inclusion, and gender equality in science. Hilton said: It’s a great privilege as WEHI director to be able to bring together the brightest minds from around the world who are collaborating and innovating to help people live healthier for longer. Melbourne is an internationally recognised and vibrant hub of biomedical research, and it’s wonderful that the City of Melbourne recognises and supports our amazing researchers. Updated at 7.01am GMT 6.35am GMT Tokyo confirms record daily coronavirus increase Tokyo confirmed a record 539 new Covid cases on Saturday, beating its previous high of 534 cases, according to the Tokyo metropolitan government. Saturday marks the third day that the daily number of cases has topped 500, according to the public broadcaster NHK, Reuters said. Updated at 6.38am GMT 6.27am GMT A British genomics expert says the UK is the best placed country in the world to identify the reinfection of Covid-19, PA has reported. Dr Andrew Page, head of informatics at the Quadram Institute in Norwich, a partner in the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium, told PA that reinfections were likely at some point in the future, although it was unclear when immunity waned for Sars-Cov-2. Page said: We know from other coronaviruses that immunity wanes, but it is a question of how long. At the moment, we don’t really know – only time will tell. It may be a year, it may be five years. He said the UK was well placed to identify reinfections because it has conducted genomic sequencing on so many different samples of the virus. The UK consortium has generated more than 100,000 genomes of the coronavirus responsible for the pandemic, making up more than 45% of the global total. In the UK, we have now sequenced so many of the samples, and they link back to NHS numbers, so we will know when someone is infected twice. There are about 200 different strains of the virus circulating in the UK, Page told PA. Those strains can be traced back to particular locations. When someone comes back from, say, a holiday, with fair confidence, we can tell where it has come from, is it new, and whether it has been seen in the UK. We can do these investigations and it does help inform the people who are doing the contact tracing simply by linking things together, so they can make better decisions. Updated at 6.35am GMT 6.17am GMT Where things stand in Australia A quick summary of where things are at at the end of the day in Australia: South Australia’s 1.6 million residents will be allowed out of their homes at midnight, but are required to wear masks for the next eight days and comply with new restrictions. SA was put into a six-day hard lockdown on Wednesday, under the toughest rules ever seen in Australia, but it was shortened to three days after authorities learned one of the 26 positive cases in the Parafield cluster had lied in a contact tracing interview. The person who allegedly lied to contact tracers is a 36-year-old man from Spain on a temporary graduate student visa, which expires next month. A team of 20 detectives is investigating the alleged deception. SA recorded just one new case on Saturday, connected to the Parafield cluster. Victoria recorded no new cases for the 22nd day in a row and now has just one active case. Virus fragments were detected in wastewater testing in the Altona area. Victoria will lift its border restrictions against South Australia from midnight, with a new permit system to apply. New South Wales recorded no new locally acquired cases for the 14th day in a row, but 10 in hotel quarantine. That’s one full infection cycle – it has to record 28 days with no new cases for Queensland and WA to reopen their borders. Victoria is just six days away from that target. WA recorded one new case in hotel quarantine. Queensland recorded two new cases, also in people who are in hotel quarantine. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, says he is “very confident” the Australian Open tennis tournament will go ahead in early 2021. Updated at 6.37am GMT 6.10am GMT The UK’s deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, takes Zoom etiquette very seriously. Van-Tam was in isolation on Friday evening, after a close contact tested positive to the virus, so appeared at a coronavirus briefing via video conference. And, as one does to avoid confusion when talking over communications technology, he ended every contribution by saying “over”. He may have started a trend.

Authorities did have concern over a test taken from a woman in her 80s, which showed a positive result. The Victorian health department’s expert review panel has now determined it is a false positive. The department said: The case had no identified links to a known Covid-19 case and was not showing symptoms. Close contacts of the potential case also tested negative yesterday. The Expert Review Panel agreed the results are consistent with the original result being a false positive. Public health actions in relation to this case have been stood down. Virus fragments were picked up in wastewater testing in the Altona sewage catchment, in Melbourne’s western suburbs. Affected suburbs are Altona, Altona Meadows, Laverton, Point Cook and Sanctuary Lakes. It follows the detection of virus fragments at Portland, about four hours’ drive west of Melbourne, and Benalla, about 2.5 hours north. Pop-up testing sites have been set up in Point Cook, Benalla and Portland, details here. Updated at 5.56am GMT 5.38am GMT We mentioned earlier that the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, is confident that the NHS can begin a national program to immunise people against Covid-19 next month, if the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is approved. That’s the vaccine that needs to be stored at -75C. So what are the practical challenges of distributing it to a nation of 66 million? Denis Campbell and Lisa O’Carroll explain: If Pfizer’s vaccine is approved it will ship it from its production plant in Puurs in Belgium in freezer boxes containing 195 vials of the vaccine, each of which holds five doses. Dry ice in the double membrane boxes will keep the vaccine at the required -75C temperature. Once it has reached Britain, it will be taken by truck to a network of 50 medicine storage warehouses at undisclosed locations which already supply 92% of the country’s drugs and deliver medications daily to 16,500 hospitals, pharmacies and primary care health centres. Martin Sawer, the executive director of the Healthcare Distribution Association, which represents the warehouse owners, said the vaccine will be kept in specially-designed extreme-low temperature freezers acquired by the NHS and lent to warehouses for the duration of the rollout. Once an order is received from vaccination centres, stocks will be moved to “massive fridges the size of small bungalows” to be defrosted over three hours and, once thawed, placed in refrigerated vans immediately for distribution. The boxes can remain stored at their sub-Arctic temperature for up to six months. But once opened and thawing begins, the NHS will be in a race against time to ensure it is delivered and administered before it expires, to avoid wastage. The government has ordered 40m doses of Pfizer’s vaccine. But with 20m-22m people in 10 priority groups the first to be immunised, and each due to receive two injections three weeks apart, NHS England has told GPs and everyone else involved in giving the jabs that no more than 5% of vaccines must be wasted.

Let’s go to Germany now, where the confirmed number of coronavirus cases has increased by 22,964 to 902,528, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Saturday. The reported death toll rose by 254 to 13,884, the tally showed. Updated at 5.12am GMT 5.02am GMT I’m handing over to my colleague Calla Wahlquist, who will take you through to the early evening. Some of the key things so far today: The total number of Covid-19 cases globally has reached 57.5 million. The number of deaths in Mexico has surpassed 100,000. South Australia recorded one new case – a close contact of another case – as the state prepares to lift its hard lockdown at midnight. There have been no new cases in New South Wales and Victoria. China is beginning three days of universal screening in Tianjin. Updated at 5.08am GMT 4.47am GMT AAP reports: The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has welcomed a joint statement from Asia Pacific leaders calling for free and predictable trade for economic recovery out of the coronavirus pandemic. Leaders of the 21-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group, including US President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping, agreed they would not resort to protectionist policies. The joint communique, after a virtual summit hosted on Friday by Malaysia, was made in the midst of ongoing trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. “It was a very positive meeting,” Mr Morrison told Australian reporters via video link from The Lodge on Saturday. “People are very focused on vaccines and affordable early access of safe vaccines - not just in developed countries but in developing countries - and on the recovery, that trade will play such an important role in going forward.” The prime minister said he felt an undertaking from APEC nations to keep trade doors open had been “refreshed” during the meeting that ran until about 2.30am Canberra time. “Part of that is making sure we all individually seek to engage with each other to deal with any issues as they arise - which is a point I made last night,” Mr Morrison said. In the communique, the leaders said they recognised “the importance of a free, open, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent and predictable trade and investment environment” to drive growth during the crisis. 4.35am GMT Here is a look at the latest data globally from Johns Hopkins University. Global cases stand at 57.5m. These are the countries with the highest total number of cases: 1. United States: 11,908,396 2. India: 9,004,365 3. Brazil: 6,020,164 4. France: 2,160,343 5. Russia: 2,023,025 Globally, these are the countries that have recorded the highest death toll from the virus: 1. United States: 254,383 2. Brazil: 168,613 3. India: 132,162 4. Mexico: 100,823 5. United Kingdom: 54,381 Updated at 6.49am GMT 4.24am GMT While lockdowns in South Australia will ease tonight, aged care facilities will still be on high alert, the ABC has reported. Patricia Sparrow, the chief executive of Aged and Community Services Australia, says the sector has learned from what had happened in Victoria. “The contact tracing in South Australia has been good, which is important because it allows providers to manage it better,” she says. “There has been a South Australian aged care response centre set up. We didn’t have that in Victoria initially, it took a while to come on. So things that we did in Victoria as the situation unfolded, people have learned that lesson and that’s been stood up much more quickly.” Sparrow says a group of aged care provider peak bodies and consumer peak bodies had updated visitor codes for residential aged care in South Australia. Updated at 4.37am GMT 4.17am GMT Health authorities in Western Australia say the state has recorded one new case of Covid-19, bringing the state’s total to 797. The confirmed case is a woman in her 30s who returned to Perth from overseas. She is in hotel quarantine. WA Health is monitoring 16 active cases and 772 confirmed cases have recovered from the virus in WA. Updated at 4.19am GMT 4.06am GMT Still in the UK, major trials will begin this weekend of an antibody cocktail that scientists hope will protect people against Covid-19 and could be swiftly used in care homes or on cruise ships in the event of an outbreak. A UK volunteer will be given the first dose of a drug that is expected to give vulnerable people immediate protection. The jab into the muscle of the arm takes effect straight away and could last for six months to a year. If it works as well as scientists predict, it could be used to protect those who cannot be given vaccines because of their state of health.

But to ensure the Philippines, which has the second-highest number of Covid-19 cases and deaths in south-east Asia, will have enough medical professionals to fight the pandemic, only 5,000 healthcare workers will be allowed to leave every year, Bello said. Updated at 3.39am GMT 3.12am GMT Covid vaccines and global economic recovery will be high on the agenda of this weekend’s G20 summit, which is being held virtually because of the pandemic, Reuters reports: Leaders of the 20 biggest world economies (G20) will debate this weekend how to deal with the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic that has caused a global recession and how to manage the recovery once the coronavirus is under control. High on the agenda are purchases and global distribution of vaccines, drugs and tests for low income countries that cannot afford such expenses themselves. The European Union will urge the G20 on Saturday to invest $4.5bn to help. “The main theme will be to step up global cooperation to address the pandemic,” said a senior G20 official taking part in the preparations for the two-day summit, chaired by Saudi Arabia and held virtually because of the pandemic. To prepare for the future, the EU will propose a treaty on pandemics. Updated at 3.27am GMT 2.59am GMT In case you missed it earlier today, Andrew Giuliani, a White House aide and the son of Rudy Giuliani, confirmed he has tested positive for coronavirus. Reuters reports: Andrew Giuliani, a White House aide and son of Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, said on Friday he had tested positive for Covid-19. “I am experiencing mild symptoms, and am following all appropriate protocols, including being in quarantine and conducting contact tracing,” he said on Twitter. Andrew attended his father’s press conference on Thursday at the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, according to multiple reports. Jenna Ellis, another Trump lawyer who spoke at the press conference, said on Twitter on Friday that she and the elder Giuliani “have both tested negative for Covid-19”.

Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters Updated at 3.32am GMT 2.48am GMT South Korea has reported 386 new Covid cases. Authorities are warning tougher measures will be needed if the country’s third wave of the virus is not quickly contained, Reuters reports: South Korea’s third wave of Covid-19 continued on Saturday after medical groups called for stricter social-distancing curbs and the government warned of tougher measures if infections are not quickly contained. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency reported 386 new daily coronavirus cases as of Friday midnight, bringing total infections to 30,403, with 503 deaths. New cases topped 300 for the fourth day in a row, after Tuesday saw the highest since August. Without effective measures such as stricter distancing, the daily tally could reach 1,000 in the next two weeks, the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases and eight other medical societies warned. “This winter is expected to be the biggest challenge in the Covid-19 response,” the groups said in a statement on Friday, calling on the public to take steps voluntarily. “There has been good news on successful development of Covid-19 vaccines, but this winter we have to stop it without a vaccine.” Although South Korea tightened prevention guidelines on Thursday and the prime minister, Chung Sye-kyun, called on Friday for all social gatherings to be cancelled, bars, nightclubs, religious services and sports events are still allowed with attendance restrictions. Updated at 2.57am GMT 2.31am GMT A final note from Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison on the return of international flights to Victoria. He told premier Daniel Andrews: I also particularly thank you for the work that has been done to get the international arrivals happening again – over 1,000 people coming in a week – that will greatly assist us in getting Australians home. And we will look at that again after about four weeks and see how we go from there, but appreciate that getting back on well ... that is tremendous and the more Australians we can get home before Christmas, the better. So thank you very much and have a good weekend, mate. Andrews: Terrific, thanks very much, PM. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison speaks to the media during a virtual press conference. Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP Updated at 2.43am GMT 2.28am GMT Victorian premier 'very confident' Australian Open will go ahead in early 2021 The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, says he is “very confident” the Australian Open tennis tournament will go ahead in early 2021. Key to this going ahead is the return of international flights to Melbourne, which will happen from 7 December with the resumption of the hotel quarantine system. This is not a simple thing, to have many hundreds or indeed potentially well more than 1,000 athletes and others who support them, media, being here for a very important event. It has to be done safely, it has to be done right. I am very confident we will have an Australian Open in the early part of next year. The exact timing of it, the exact arrangements we put in place, they are not settled yet and as soon as they are I will be more than happy to share it with you. But I would not read too much into some of the reports. A lot of people are doing a lot of talking about these things and while they are talking, we’re getting on with the work so that we can have one of our most significant major events, not just for the state but indeed for the whole nation, happen as close to normal, as normal as anything can be, Covid-normal, as possible. Updated at 2.35am GMT 2.21am GMT Back in Australia, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, are giving a joint press conference via Zoom about the $4bn Melbourne to Geelong faster rail project. They are on video link because Morrison is undergoing quarantine at the lodge after returning from Japan this week. The two leaders have been engaged in a power struggle in the past few months, which came to a head during Melbourne’s second wave of coronavirus. The federal government blamed the outbreak on the failures of Victoria’s hotel quarantine system and the Victorian government blamed the heavy death toll on failures in the commonwealth-run aged care system. Both of these things are true. In recent weeks, Victoria has been facing federal pressure to begin accepting international flights again to ease the pressure on other states. Morrison made sure to mention it in the joint press conference, saying that international travellers would have an expectation of a rail connection to the airport, which is part of an airport rail project connected to the Geelong rail project. Morrison: Let’s not forget the international travels, and they will be back soon we hope. Andrews: They will be back. Morrison: They have an expectation of world-class cities that such infrastructure will be in place and that is exciting that will now be realised for Melbourne.

Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP Updated at 2.44am GMT 2.11am GMT In case you missed this news earlier, Donald Trump Jr has tested positive for Covid-19. That takes the number of Trumps to have tested positive to the virus to four. The outgoing president, Donald Trump, the first lady, and their son Barron tested positive to the virus last month and have since recovered. Trump Jr’s girlfriend also tested positive back in July. It comes as the United States recorded 2,015 deaths from Covid-19 on Thursday, the highest single day death toll since May. The US also set a new daily record for the number of new infections recorded in one day, with 187,000 cases on Thursday. A quarter of a million people have now died of Covid-19 in the US. Related: Donald Trump Jr tests positive for coronavirus 1.59am GMT Victoria down to one active Covid case In Australia, the state of Victoria currently has one active coronavirus case. However, residents and visitors to Altona, in Melbourne’s south-west, have been urged to get tested if they have even mild symptoms after traces of the virus were found in waste water, AAP reports: Victoria has one active Covid-19 case but authorities are concerned about traces of the virus unexpectedly found at a Melbourne waste water facility. The state has gone 22 days with no new cases. One patient was cleared in the past 24 hours, leaving just one active case, that of an immunosuppressed person who the health minister, Martin Foley, said on Saturday was making a “slow and steady” recovery. A weak-positive case that was under review, that of an elderly woman, has been ruled negative. Authorities meanwhile have issued a plea for residents and visitors to Altona in Melbourne’s south-west from last Monday to Wednesday to get tested if they have even mild symptoms. Virus traces have been detected in a wastewater sample collected from the Altona sewage catchment on Wednesday. The result is unexpected because it has been about eight weeks since someone in the area tested positive. Suburbs in the catchment include Altona, Altona Meadows, Laverton, Point Cook and Sanctuary Lakes. “It could mean there is somebody in the community that we have missed,” Foley said. Updated at 2.58am GMT 1.49am GMT China to begin three days of universal screening in Tianjin China has reported 16 new coronavirus cases, as the city of Tianjin, near Beijing, launches a three-day universal screening programme covering nearly 3 million residents, Reuters reports: Mainland China reported 16 new Covid-19 cases on 20 November, down from 17 the previous day, with seven cases of local transmission and nine cases originating overseas, the country’s health authority said on Saturday. The National Health Commission said in its daily bulletin that five of the local transmissions took place in Tianjin and two in Shanghai. Tianjin, which neighbours the capital Beijing, will launch a three-day universal screening programme covering nearly 3 million of its residents on Saturday. Local officials said on Friday that one community in Tianjin had been placed in lockdown and around 1,900 people have been quarantined, according to the China Daily newspaper. Mainland China also reported another 18 cases of asymptomatic cases on 20 November, up from 14 on the previous day. It has so far reported an accumulated total of 86,414 Covid-19 cases, with the official death toll at 4,634. Updated at 2.08am GMT 1.39am GMT Mexico records more than 6,000 new Covid cases In Mexico, the Covid-19 death toll has passed 100,000, with more than 1 million cases. Mexico’s health ministry on Friday reported 6,426 new confirmed coronavirus infections in the country and 719 deaths, bringing the official totals to 1,025,969 cases and 100,823 dead, Reuters reports. Health officials have said the real number of cases is likely significantly higher than the official tally. Updated at 1.48am GMT 1.28am GMT In case you missed it earlier: In Australia, New South Wales has reached two weeks – one complete infection cycle – without a single locally transmitted coronavirus case, AAP reports. Ten cases of the virus were diagnosed in hotel quarantine in the 24 hours to 8pm on Friday, from more than 16,000 tests. While Victoria on Saturday announced it had just one active virus case remaining, NSW Health is still treating 70 cases. “While there have been no new locally acquired cases in NSW for the past 14 days, we continue to encourage people to get tested, even if they display only the mildest of symptoms such as a runny nose, scratchy throat, cough or fever,” NSW Health’s Dr Jan Fizzell said on Saturday. NSW has reached the milestone as South Australian brings its outbreak under control and as the due date for a decision on Queensland’s border with NSW approaches. Queensland health authorities have said Sydney must go 28 days – two whole infection cycles – without any locally transmitted virus cases for restrictions to lift. Updated at 1.33am GMT 1.13am GMT The coronavirus pandemic and Victoria’s 112-day lockdown has decimated the Australian state’s coffers, with treasurer Tim Pallas expected to outline a $23.3bn deficit and more than $150bn in net debt in Tuesday’s budget. AAP reports: But it is not all bad news, with the budget also expected to include tax cuts and incentives to lure global companies to the state, as well as already-announced boosts for mental health and social housing. Details obtained by AAP show the Andrews government will undertake record borrowing which will grow net debt to $86bn in 2020/21, before reaching $154bn by 2023/24. The state was already borrowing billions for major infrastructure projects before the pandemic hit. Interest rates are at record lows, so increased borrowing is among the best ways to revive the economy and support Victorians, Mr Pallas says. “This is a budget that puts the Victorian people first, with the support they need to recover and rebuild,” he said in a statement on Saturday. “We’re following the blueprint of jurisdictions around Australia and the world, who are using their own budgets to protect household and business budgets.” With economic output plummeting and unemployment skyrocketing as a result of the pandemic, much of the money borrowed will be spent on job-boosting infrastructure projects and social and business supports. The government’s infrastructure spend is forecast to average $19.6bn each year over the forward estimates – which the treasurer says is four times the 10-year average prior to 2014. Updated at 1.19am GMT 1.09am GMT Welcome to our ongoing live coronavirus coverage. Here is what you need to know about events around the world so far today: The number of coronavirus cases in Brazil has surpassed 6 million, becoming the third country in the world to pass that milestone after the United States and India. Brazil recorded 38,397 additional confirmed cases in the past 24 hours and 552 deaths from Covid-19, the health ministry said. The official death toll has risen to 168,613, according to ministry data. Donald Trump Jr tested positive for Covid-19 this week. A spokesman says he is quarantining but has had no symptoms. The city of Toronto has returned to lockdown amid a surge of coronavirus cases in Canada. France has recorded a further 1,138 deaths over the past 24 hours from the virus, taking the total to 48,265. France has also reported 22,882 cases in the past 24 hours, compared with 21,150 on Thursday. Iran will impose tougher restrictions nationwide as the Middle East country hardest hit by the coronavirus battles a third wave of infections. The toughest measures, under which non-essential businesses and services are to close, will be imposed in the capital Tehran and about 160 other high risk “red” cities and towns, state media said. In South Australia, police continue to investigate a Covid-19 case linked to a pizza bar in Adelaide after a worker lied to contact tracers about his job at there. South Australia recorded one new Covid-19 case on Saturday, a close contact of another case. The state’s lockdown lifts at midnight, Australian time. The Australian state of Victoria has recorded its 22nd day of no new coronavirus cases but authorities are asking anyone in the Altona catchment to get tested if they have symptoms after coronavirus was detected in sewage. NSW recorded no new locally acquired Covid-19 cases. Two new cases were reported in Queensland today, both in hotel quarantine. Portugal’s parliament approved a 15-day extension of a state of emergency from next week to allow continuation of coronavirus measures as the government considers fresh steps. Drugmaker Pfizer Inc is hoping to rapidly roll out its experimental Covid-19 vaccine around Latin America soon after it gets emergency authorisation in the US, a senior executive said, which could be as early as next month.

The news, which took Brazil’s total death toll to nearly 270,000, comes as the South American lives through the most severe moment in its 13-month outbreak and sparked renewed calls for a nationwide lockdown. Italy recorded 100,000 coronavirus deaths, a year after it became the first western country to impose a total lockdown and as it braces for a third wave of the pandemic. Japan decided to stage this summer’s Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics without overseas spectators due to public concern about Covid-19, the Kyodo news agency has said, citing officials with knowledge of the matter. The World Trade Organization director-general called for urgent action on boosting Covid-19 vaccine production in developing countries, saying manufacturing sites could be prepared in six to seven months or less than half the time previously thought. Estonia’s government has banned groups larger than two people, closed non-essential shops and told restaurants to switch to take-aways as part of a drive to contain a surge in Covid-19 infections. Denmark’s health minister Magnus Heunicke said there were grounds to ease restrictions further since the epidemic was not worsening in the Nordic country. People who are vaccinated against Covid-19, have antibodies or test negative can travel to Greece this summer, tourism minister Harry Theocharis has said, after the country led calls for an EU-wide vaccination certificate. Seventeen European countries received doses from a batch of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine that authorities in Austria have stopped using while investigating a death and an illness, a senior health official said. Johnson & Johnson told the EU it was facing supply issues that may complicate plans to deliver 55 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine to the bloc in the second quarter of the year, an EU official told Reuters. The developers of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine have questioned the neutrality of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) after an EMA official urged EU members to hold off approving the vaccine. The UK’s foreign secretary Dominic Raab has written to the European Council president after he claimed the UK imposed an “outright ban” on coronavirus vaccine exports. Raab said he is seeking to “set the record straight”. Palestinian hospitals became overfull and intensive-care units were operating at 100% capacity with coronavirus patients in some areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, announced some limited relaxations to outdoor mixing in Scotland, in particular for teenagers. Bosnia’s foreign minister said she and her compatriots were “justifiably unhappy” after failing to yet to receive any of the promised vaccines from the EU-backed Covax scheme. 11.43pm GMT The White House medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci, has spoken about the challenge of containing more infectious variants of Covid-19 even as vaccines are rolled out, in an online conversation with Australia’s chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly. “Here is the challenge: are we going to chase each variant in an almost whack-a-mole way, or are we going to try and get a vaccine that has a good degree of protection against several strains and get the level of virus so low that we don’t really have an outbreak?” he asked. “Both strategies are being pursued in the United States.” Related: Dr Fauci praises Australia's Covid lockdowns: 'Viruses don't mutate unless they replicate' 11.26pm GMT The Red Cross has warned of a glaring gap in the plans to roll out Covid-19 vaccines around the world, saying remote communities risked missing out. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is aiming to help vaccinate 500 million people. The IFRC, which calls itself the world’s largest humanitarian network, is planning to throw its expertise into the distribution and acceptance of vaccines among some of the hardest-to-reach communities. But it said that while the procurement of vaccines and delivery to airport hubs was crucial, “too little thought” had been given to the next step: how those doses would be distributed within countries, including the “last mile” in getting to those furthest away. The Geneva-based federation said it needed 100 million Swiss francs ($111 million, 92.5 million euros) to fill the logistics gap between vaccines reaching airports in capital cities, and remote settlements. But so far the IFRC has raised only three percent of that figure. Without this funding, a gap will remain between the vaccines that will ultimately end this pandemic, and some of the most vulnerable and isolated people in the world,” said IFRC president Francesco Rocca. Such a gap means that the virus will continue to circulate and mutate, and that people will continue to get sick and die.” 11.00pm GMT The U.S. House of Representatives has voted to advance President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill, clearing the way for the measure to be considered on Wednesday, when a final vote is expected. 10.35pm GMT Governments can help protect women & their children from violence during #COVID19. ✅ Incl. violence against women essential services in COVID-19 emergency preparedness & response plans ✅ Support hotlines, shelters & other specialized services pic.twitter.com/c72toZRrgL — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) March 9, 2021 10.20pm GMT BioNTech SE could have capacity to make 3 billion doses of the Covid-19 vaccine it developed with partner Pfizer Inc next year, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing an interview with the German company’s chief executive officer. While BioNTech could increase manufacturing capacity in principle, it depends on demand and factors such as requirement of additional boost to vaccinations, CEO Ugur Sahin said. Pfizer last month said it aims to make at least 2 billion doses of its COVID-19 vaccine in 2021. 10.05pm GMT Brazil suffers highest daily death toll Brazil has suffered its highest daily death toll since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, with the confirmation of 1,972 new fatalities. The news, which took Brazil’s total death toll to nearly 270,000, comes as the South American lives through the most severe moment in its 13-month outbreak and sparked renewed calls for a nationwide lockdown. “São Paulo is on the verge of a public health collapse unprecedented in its history,” warned Miguel Nicolelis, a leading Brazilian scientist. “Football must stop now. Schools must close. Churches must close and services stop now.” A record 517 deaths were recorded in Brazil’s most populous state, São Paulo, on Tuesday. But Brazil’s far-right leader, Jair Bolsonaro, has declared he has no intention of ordering restrictions and last week told citizens to stop “whining” about the worst public health crisis in the country’s history. Átila Iamarino, a Brazilian biologist who has become one of the country’s most prominent scientific voices during the pandemic, told the Guardian: “Without a shutdown, what we are going to witness here is unthinkable. “ The numbers are insane … I simply cannot conceive a situation in which there is no shutdown.

Raab sought to “set the record straight” in a letter to the EU chief on Tuesday evening, writing that “any references to a UK export ban or any restrictions on vaccines are completely false”. He insisted the UK government “has not blocked a single Covid-19 vaccine or vaccine components”, adding: “We are all facing this pandemic together.” 9.00pm GMT A summary of today's developments Italy recorded 100,000 coronavirus deaths, a year after it became the first western country to impose a total lockdown and as it braces for a third wave of the pandemic. Japan decided to stage this summer’s Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics without overseas spectators due to public concern about Covid-19, the Kyodo news agency has said, citing officials with knowledge of the matter. The World Trade Organization director-general called for urgent action on boosting Covid-19 vaccine production in developing countries, saying manufacturing sites could be prepared in six to seven months or less than half the time previously thought. Estonia’s government has banned groups larger than two people, closed non-essential shops and told restaurants to switch to take-aways as part of a drive to contain a surge in Covid-19 infections. Denmark’s health minister Magnus Heunicke said there were grounds to ease restrictions further since the epidemic was not worsening in the Nordic country. People who are vaccinated against Covid-19, have antibodies or test negative can travel to Greece this summer, tourism minister Harry Theocharis has said, after the country led calls for an EU-wide vaccination certificate. Seventeen European countries received doses from a batch of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine that authorities in Austria have stopped using while investigating a death and an illness, a senior health official said. Johnson & Johnson told the EU it was facing supply issues that may complicate plans to deliver 55 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine to the bloc in the second quarter of the year, an EU official told Reuters. The developers of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine have questioned the neutrality of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) after an EMA official urged EU members to hold off approving the vaccine. The UK’s foreign secretary Dominic Raab has written to the European Council president after he claimed the UK imposed an “outright ban” on coronavirus vaccine exports. Raab said he is seeking to “set the record straight”. Palestinian hospitals became overfull and intensive-care units were operating at 100% capacity with coronavirus patients in some areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, announced some limited relaxations to outdoor mixing in Scotland, in particular for teenagers. Bosnia’s foreign minister said she and her compatriots were “justifiably unhappy” after failing to yet to receive any of the promised vaccines from the EU-backed Covax scheme. Updated at 9.03pm GMT 8.50pm GMT The World Trade Organization director-general called for urgent action on boosting Covid-19 vaccine production in developing countries, saying manufacturing sites could be prepared in six to seven months or less than half the time previously thought. “The fact is that each additional day the vaccine shortage continues, people will pay with their lives,” said Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala at a two-day summit focused on Covid-19 vaccine production , Reuters reports. 8.37pm GMT Manufacturing capacity and ingredients shortages are the main bottlenecks to expanding Covid-19 vaccine production, several global drug groups said, not patents that some critics are demanding be removed. IP (intellectual property) rights is not the issue,” said Thomas Cueni, who heads the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA). The bottlenecks are the capacity, the scarcity of raw materials, scarcity of ingredients, and it is about the know-how.” Cueni, who represents large drugmakers, spoke after a virtual meeting organised partly by the World Health Organization-backed COVAX vaccine sharing programme, Reuters reports. It included manufacturers, suppliers and international organizations seeking to boost vaccine supplies. 8.19pm GMT Estonia’s government has banned groups larger than two people, closed non-essential shops and told restaurants to switch to take-aways as part of a drive to contain a surge in Covid-19 infections. Primary schools will have to switch to online education, which was mandated to older students earlier this month in the Baltic nation of 1.3 million battles the second highest per capita rate of infections in the European Union after the Czech Republic. The government said it had recorded 1,336 cases over the previous 14 days per 100,000 people, more than twice the level seen a month ago and a fifth more than last week, when it told restaurants and many shops to close during weekend to control the surge. The new restrictions, which come into effect from Thursday, will stay until April 11. “The fresh data shows that the more aggressive British variant of the coronavirus is spreading more seriously in Estonia than previously predicted. Our medical system is in a crisis,” Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said. “This is the only way to the come out of the crisis. How fast we manage to do that depends of the behaviour of each individual*. 8.04pm GMT Ashley Hinson speaks at a press conference following a conference meeting at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC.

Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty Images 7.48pm GMT A representative of the EU’s delegation in Britain has been summoned by London after European Council President Charles Michel said the country has an outright ban on exports of Covid-19 shots, The Sun newspaper reported. “(Foreign minister Dominic Raab has written written to Michel demanding this is corrected, according to the newspaper. Earlier, a British government spokesman said the country has not blocked the export of coronavirus vaccines. The Foreign Office has yet to comment on the reports. 7.36pm GMT No company in France has signed a contract with Russia to produce its Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine, a spokesman for France’s industry minister said, appearing to contradict the head of Russia’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund. “We have not identified a site which meets their requirements,” the spokesman said when asked about a possible deal signed with RDIF. “As far as we’re aware, no contract has been signed by a company in France to produce the Sputnik V vaccine,” he said. Earlier, the head of Russia’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund said his organisation had struck deals with production facilities in Italy, Spain, France and Germany to manufacture the Russian shot. Speaking to state channel Rossiya 24, RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev did not provide any details, Reuters reports. Dmitriev was speaking after RDIF signed a commercial deal with Swiss-based drugmaker Adienne to produce the vaccine in Italy. An adviser to President Emmanuel Macron left the door open for a partnership between France and Russia on Sputnik V. “It’s one topic on which we can have a positive cooperation,” the adviser told reporters. “One of the difficulties Sputnik is facing is having access to production capacity for the volumes they would want.” 7.19pm GMT Zimbabwe has authorised the emergency use of four Covid-19 vaccines, including Russia’s Sputnik V and China’s Sinovac, the minister of information said. The southern African nation last month rolled out its Covid-19 vaccination programme after receiving a donation of 200,000 doses of shots from China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm). Last week, India announced that Zimbabwe had become the first African country to authorise the use of its Covaxin vaccine. The Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe has authorised the use of Sinopharm and Sinovac shots from China, Russia’s Sputnik V and India’s Covaxin, the information minister Monica Mutsvangwa said in a post-Cabinet briefing. “All Covid-19 approved vaccines will be procured through the National Vaccine Procurement Fund managed by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development,” Mutsvangwa said. She said private businesses wishing to import their own vaccines for employees should purchase only registered vaccines, Reuters reports. 7.05pm GMT The US has administered 93,692,598 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Tuesday morning and distributed 123,232,775 doses, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The tally is for Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccines as of 6:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday, the agency said. According to the tally posted on March 8, the agency had administered 92,089,852 doses of the vaccines, and distributed 116,378,615 doses. A total of 7,419,240 vaccine doses have been administered in long-term care facilities, the agency said. 6.52pm GMT Summary Italy recorded 100,000 coronavirus deaths, a year after it became the first western country to impose a total lockdown and as it braces for a third wave of the pandemic.

Reuters reports: The private and public sectors of tourism-dependent countries such as Spain, Italy and Greece have sought a unified response to the patchwork of health requisites, bans and quarantines which have grounded global travel. Amadeus said its system, which will be hosted within an existing platform for storing identification data, is due to be deployed in the second quarter. It will allow passengers to upload certificates or results from PCR or serological tests into any airline’s mobile app or website as part of the check-in process and cut down on the need for costly manual checks. “The current need to hand-verify health documents while maintaining social distance means that some of our airline customers need around 90% of their check-in staff to process just 30% of passengers,” Monika Wiederhold, global lead for safe travel at Amadeus, said in a statement. 6.16pm GMT Turkey has today recorded 13,755 new cases of coronavirus, health ministry data showed, the highest level since 6 January, more than week after president Tayyip Erdogan announced an easing of measures to curb the pandemic. The total number of cases rose to 2,807,387 and the data also showed 66 people died due to Covid-19 in the same period, raising the toll to 29,160. On Monday last week, Erdogan announced the partial opening of cafes, restaurants and schools, as well as an easing of weekend lockdowns among measures which he called a “controlled normalisation”. 6.08pm GMT Germany has temporarily suspended financial assistance to some companies suffering under lockdown measures to contain the coronavirus after identifying several cases of suspected fraud, the economy ministry has said. Reuters reports: The suspension affects companies which applied for special assistance for November and December as well as some special bridge loans. It said the suspension began on March 5 but did not say how many companies were affected. The ministry said it had referred the suspicious cases to prosecutors who have launched investigations into the irregularities. “There are suspicions that in a few cases corona-related state aid was obtained unlawfully through fraud,” an economy ministry spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. “Payments are being reviewed and temporarily halted. Aid will be made available (again) shortly.” The ministry did not say how much money was involved but the German-language website of Business Insider, the US-based news outlet that first reported the suspected fraud, put the figure in the millions of euros. 5.51pm GMT The UK government has accused EU chief Charles Michel of spreading falsehoods after he claimed the UK imposed an “outright ban” on coronavirus vaccine exports. PA reports that the European Council president accused Britain and the US of imposing bans on the movement of jabs as he sought to defend the bloc against allegations of “vaccine nationalism”. In the latest display of post-Brexit turbulence, the government struck back to refute his comments and insist the UK has “not blocked the export of a single Covid-19 vaccine”. Michel, in a newsletter, said he was “shocked” when he heard allegations of vaccine nationalism levelled at the EU, saying: The facts do not lie ... The UK and the US have imposed an outright ban on the export of vaccines or vaccine components produced on their territory. But the European Union, the region with the largest vaccine production capacity in the world, has simply put in place a system for controlling the export of doses produced in the EU.” But the UK government denied his claims. The UK government has not blocked the export of a single Covid-19 vaccine. Any references to a UK export ban or any restrictions on vaccines are completely false. This pandemic is a global challenge and international collaboration on vaccine development continues to be an integral part of our response. 5.41pm GMT After initially being anxious about what was feared could be a “PR nightmare” over inoculating prisoners Tennessee, US, officials have said some inmates were receiving a Covid vaccine — but only those who qualify as part of other groups the state has prioritised, AP reports. The Department of Correction has ordered 2,000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and 980 doses of the Moderna vaccine to be distributed to inmates who are 65 and older or have health conditions that put them in groups already given priority status by the state, department spokesperson Dorinda Carter said in an email. “We anticipate receiving additional doses soon and will order more doses, as needed,” Carter said. “The vaccine will be administered first to older inmates and those with health risks.” He added that the state had begun vaccinating inmates today. 5.26pm GMT Palestinian intensive care units at 100% capacity Palestinian hospitals are overfull and intensive-care units operating at 100% capacity with coronavirus patients in some areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh has said. Reuters reports: Palestinian cities have introduced full lockdowns over the last two weeks to control soaring COVID-19 infections, even as neighbouring Israel has begun to lift restrictions as it proceeds with one of the world’s fastest vaccination campaigns. “The percentage of hospital occupancy in some areas has reached more than 100%,” Shtayyeh said in Ramallah, one of the West Bank cities where his Palestinian Authority (PA) exercises limited self-rule. “The number of casualties is increasing and the number of deaths is increasing on a daily basis, forcing us to take strict, direct and unprecedented measures.” The West Bank and Gaza, home to a combined 5.2 million Palestinians, have received around 34,700 vaccine doses to date. These came from small donations by Israel and Russia as well as 20,000 sent by the United Arab Emirates to Gaza. Meanwhile in Israel, restaurants reopened on Sunday as the country kept up a fast pace of mass vaccinations. Updated at 5.30pm GMT 4.58pm GMT Students and pro-democracy supporters demonstrated in Algeria today in contravention of lockdown as a revived protest movement enters its third week of rallies. AFP reports: The march made its way through the main streets of the Algerian capital to reach the central post office, AFP journalists said. The site was an emblematic rallying point for the Hirak pro-democracy movement that began in February 2019 and within weeks forced then-president Abdelaziz Bouteflika to abandon a bid for a fifth term and resign. Protesters chanted Hirak slogans calling for a “free and democratic Algeria” and “a civil not a military state” and booed president Abdelmadjid Tebboune. “The main demands of students are the departure of the ‘system’; an independent justice system; and a free press that can report what the people say, and not what the system says,” 25-year-old Ilyes told AFP. A large banner at the head of the protest read, “The regime is dead and a corpse can’t be resuscitated... Clear out!” Zakaria, a 27-year-old student, said: “We are protesting because we refuse (to accept) this system, we refuse its methods and we refuse to be divided.” Also today, activist Sami Dernouni, in custody in Tipaza, near Algiers, was sentenced to two years behind bars for inciting a gathering and undermining national unity and security, the CNLD prisoners’ rights group said.

Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images 4.30pm GMT The Czech and Hungarian prime ministers will visit Israel this week to gain know-how on Covid-19 vaccinations and vaccine production, the Czech government has said. AFP reports: Czech prime minister Andrej Babis and his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban are due to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. “Israel is a leader in technologies. It is our traditional partner. I think it will be a very useful visit,” Babis said in a statement, adding he would visit a large vaccination centre in Jerusalem. Israel has given the two recommended doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab to roughly 40 percent of its nine-million strong population, while both the Czech Republic and Hungary have been struggling with their vaccine roll-outs. The Hungarian news agency MTI quoted Orban’s spokesman Bertalan Havasi as saying he expected to “form a closer cooperation in the fight against the coronavirus” during the trilateral meeting. The Czech Republic tops the world’s statistics for Covid-19 infections per capita over the past two weeks and is second in new deaths, according to an AFP tally based on official data. 4.22pm GMT Spain has again extended its ban on arrivals from Britain, Brazil and South Africa until the end of March to avoid the spread of new coronavirus strains. Only legal residents or nationals of Spain and the neighbouring micro-state of Andorra are currently allowed in on flights from these countries. The restriction on arrivals from Britain was imposed at the end of December to halt the spread of the highly contagious Covid-19 variant discovered there in November. The Brazil and South Africa arrivals ban came into effect on 3 February. The only exceptions are for passengers in transit who cannot leave the airport nor remain there longer than 24 hours. It is the sixth time the ban on British arrivals has been extended. 4.14pm GMT The Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History has acquired the vial that contained the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine administered in the US, as part of its plans to document the global pandemic and “this extraordinary period we were going through”.

The report, conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UN partners, found that domestic violence started young, with a quarter of 15- to 19-year-old girls and young women estimated to have been abused at least once in their lives. The highest rates were found to be among 30- to 39-year-olds.

Related: Sturgeon eases some Covid rules on outdoor mixing in Scotland 3.51pm GMT The president of the European council has warned the EU should not allow itself to be misled by regimes with “less desirable values than ours” and that the bloc would not use vaccines “for propaganda purposes”. In comments that, paradoxically, meet the definition of propaganda – using information to promote a political point of view – Charles Michel criticised Russia and China’s values and defended Europe’s much-criticised Covid-19 inoculation strategy by stressing Brussels was also sharing jabs with the world. “We should not let ourselves be misled by China and Russia, both regimes with less desirable values than ours, as they organise highly limited but widely publicised operations to supply vaccines to others,” the European Council president said. “Without Europe, it would not have been possible to develop and produce several types of vaccines in less than one year.” He said the EU was “actively promoting its values” by investing early in Covid-19 vaccine development and being the prime driver of the also Covax facility, which has faced criticism for a sluggish rollout that only began recently, to deliver doses to poorer countries. EU officials believe Russia and China are trying to score political points and expand influence by rushing to deliver their vaccines before they were rigorously vetted by regulators, AFP reports. Michel’s blunt comments came as the EU’s 27 member states struggle to achieve lift-off with a plan to immunise 70 percent of adults by mid-September. Much of the initial delivery shortfall was down to AstraZeneca failing to meet its supply schedule to the bloc. Some member states, among them Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, are increasingly looking to vaccines not authorised by the EU’s medicine regulator, the EMA, to fill the gap, in particular Russia’s Sputnik V jab and ones from China. But the EU executive has indicated it is unwilling to add it to its vaccines portfolio, which is projected to deliver 2.6 billion doses over this year and next. Updated at 3.53pm GMT 3.30pm GMT Bosnia has reported a record number of daily deaths from Covid today with the capital Sarajevo going into lockdown next weekend for the first time since last May in an attempt to combat spiking infections. It comes as the Balkan country said it was “justifiably unhappy” after failing to yet to receive any of the promised vaccines from the EU-backed Covax scheme (see 12:18pm). The Balkan country of 3.3 million, where inoculations using the Russian Sputnik V vaccine have begun only in its Serb autonomous region, reported 1,251 new cases and 48 deaths from Covid today, health authorities said. Sarajevo, which has seen a daily average of 456 new coronavirus cases over the past week, will be partially shut down next weekend for the first time in almost 10 months as hospital capacities have been overstretched, authorities said. Only food shops, pharmacies and gas stations will stay open. 3.11pm GMT Italy has recorded 100,000 coronavirus deaths, a year after it became the first western country to impose a total lockdown and as it braces for a third wave of the pandemic. Among those who have died in recent days are Monique Forciniti, a 55-year-old school cook from Pistoia in Tuscany and Stefano Limongi, the 34-year-old owner of a sushi bar in Rome. Italy’s recently appointed prime minister, Mario Draghi, said that passing the “terrible threshold” of 100,000 deaths was something “we would never have imagined a year ago”. On 9 March 2020, his predecessor, Giuseppe Conte, imposed unprecedented national restrictions as the pandemic took hold. At the time, Italy had registered 463 Covid-19 deaths and 9,172 infections. One year on, the number of deaths on Monday rose to 100,103 – the highest in Europe after the UK – while the total number of infections since the onset of the pandemic last week eclipsed 3 million. “A year ago, this was something that none of us doctors had ever experienced and of course, we hoped and imagined, like everyone else, that it would end quickly,” said Saverio Chiaravalle, the vice-president of the doctors’ order in the Lombardy province of Varese and a close friend of Roberto Stella, the president of the order who was the first medic in Italy to die from the virus.

Healthcare workers at Jabra isolation hospital in the capital. Khartoum. started to get their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, the agency said, adding that the first phase of the rollout will be expanded from 15 March to 15 May to include people aged 45 or older with chronic conditions. The first phase will cover 3.5% of the country’s population. Sudan became the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to benefit from Covax facility vaccines when it received 828,000 doses of the AstraZeneca shot on 3 March. Sudan says it expects to receive the remainder of a total 3.4m doses through Covax, a vaccine-sharing programme co-led by the World Health Organization, in the second quarter of this year. It aims to cover 20% of its population of 44 million through Covax by September, health ministry officials said. #Sudan begins its #COVID19 vaccination today! \uD83D\uDC89 Health care workers and people above 45 with core morbidity are receiving their first dose of the vaccine today at the Jebra Isolation Center.#VaccinesWork #COVAX pic.twitter.com/CopVy1gu5o — UNICEF Sudan (@UNICEFSudan) March 9, 2021 Updated at 3.42pm GMT 3.00pm GMT Here is footage of Thailand’s prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, finishing his weekly news conference by spraying alcohol disinfectant on the front row of journalists.

The Tokyo 2020 games organising committee said a decision would be made by the end of March. The Olympics, postponed by a year because of the pandemic, are scheduled to take place from 23 July to 8 August and the Paralympics from 24 August to 5 September. Kyodo said the government had concluded that welcoming fans from abroad would not be possible given public concern about the coronavirus and the detection of more contagious variants in many countries, Kyodo cited the officials as saying.

Photograph: Jae C Hong/AP Updated at 2.57pm GMT 2.24pm GMT After yet more bad news this today for the EU in the form of Johnson & Johnson’s statement about supplies of its vaccine, Ireland’s taoiseach has also been voicing disappointment “with some of the issues” with vaccine supply. The comments of Michael Martin followed reports of a shortfall in the expected supply of vaccines to Ireland by the end of March. The impact of the vaccines had been very positive in terms of protecting the most vulnerable, Martin told reporters on the way into a cabinet meeting in Dublin. Those who are most vulnerable are getting vaccinated and that will have an impact, RTE quoted him as saying. “So, when we come to the week before the fifth of April, we will examine the situation,” he added. Updated at 2.58pm GMT 2.09pm GMT Greece to allow tourists who have been vaccinated, have antibodies or test negative People who are vaccinated against Covid-19, have antibodies or test negative can travel to Greece this summer, tourism minister Harry Theocharis has said. Tourism is a major income earner for Greece, which has led calls for an EU-wide vaccination certificate to help unlock travel. The industry accounts for about a fifth of the Greek economy and employs one in five workers, but arrivals collapsed last year because of the pandemic. Greece is aiming to kick off its vital summer season by mid-May, said Theocharis as he addressed the ITB Berlin trade show from the Athens Acropolis Museum, home to sculptures from Greek antiquity. Women look at an information board at the Pnyx hill in central Athens, while the remains of heavy snowall cover the Acropolis and nearby hills in Athens in February. Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty Images “Greece is ready with a complete protocol for summer 2021,” he said. “Tourists will be welcome if before travel they are either vaccinated, or have antibodies, or test negative. All tourists will be subject to random testing.” He said the authorities would prioritise the vaccination of people working in the hospitality sector once the most vulnerable were vaccinated, and were mandating the frequent testing of employees. Updated at 2.33pm GMT 1.54pm GMT Instagram’s recommendations were pushing users toward Covid misinformation, anti-vaccination content and antisemitic material during the peak of the pandemic, according to a report from a social media watchdog. Misinformation was most frequently shown to new users who followed a mix of accounts on the platform that included leading anti-vaccination personalities or wellness influencers, according to the report, Malgorithm. Volunteers who followed 10 accounts with anti-vaccine links, for instance, received recommendations for posts promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories. Numerous posts claimed there was “no pandemic”, and others called on people to “stop getting tested” and “stop wearing your mask”.

AP reports: That history was repeating itself one year after Lombardy became the epicenter of Italy’s pandemic was a sickening realisation for Dr Gabriele Zanolini, who runs the Covid ward in the M Mellini hospital in the once-walled city that maintains its medieval circular street pattern. “You know that there are patients in the emergency room, and you don’t know where to put them,” Zanolini said “This for me is anguish, not to be able to respond to people who need to be treated. The most difficult moment is to find ourselves again in a state of emergency, after so much time.” The UK variant surge has filled 90% of hospital beds in Brescia province, bordering both Veneto and Emilia-Romagna regions, as Italy crossed the grim threshold of 100,000 pandemic dead on Monday and marks the one-year anniversary Wednesday of Italy’s draconian lockdown, the first in the west. Updated at 2.20pm GMT 1.27pm GMT Johnson & Johnson reportedly tells EU it is facing supply issues Johnson & Johnson has told the EU it is facing supply issues that may complicate plans to deliver 55 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine to the bloc in the second quarter of the year, an EU official told Reuters. Any delay would be a further blow to the EU’s vaccination plans, which have been hampered by bumpy supplies from other vaccine makers and a slow rollout of shots in many member states. J&J told the EU last week that issues with the supply of vaccine ingredients and equipment meant it was “under stress” to meet the goal of delivering 55 million doses by the end of June, the EU official – who is directly involved in confidential talks with the US company – told Reuters on condition of anonymity. The official added the company had said it was not impossible to meet the goal, but that it showed caution. J&J’s vaccine, which requires only one dose for protection, is expected to be approved on 11 March for use in the EU by the bloc’s regulator. EU officials have said deliveries could start in April. The company has committed to deliver 200 million doses of its vaccine to the bloc this year. “Aligned with our agreement, we expect to begin supplying our commitment of 200 million doses to the European Union in the second quarter of 2021,” J&J said in a statement, declining to comment on possible delays or the second-quarter target. J&J began rolling out its vaccine in the United States this month, with a target of delivering 100 million doses by the end of May, but has nearly halved its delivery forecasts for March to 20 million doses as it ramps up new manufacturing facilities. Updated at 2.20pm GMT 1.12pm GMT Ukraine has approved the Sinovac Covid vaccine, country’s the health ministry has said. Ukrainian pharmaceutical company Lekhim - one of Sinovac’s partners - has an agreement with the manufacturer to deliver 5 million doses of the vaccine in Ukraine, including 1.9 million via a state procurement scheme. Lekhim said last month it had submitted documents seeking approval for the shot, while a senior ministry official said last week that authorities would impose financial penalties on the company over delays in delivering it. Ukraine, one of Europe’s poorer countries, has lagged behind many of its neighbours in securing vaccines for its 41 million people, asking EU states for help while refusing to buy Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine. Ukraine started Covid-19 vaccinations in late February but only 19,118 first shots had been given by 9 March. 12.55pm GMT Russia has denied Washington’s claims that it was spearheading a disinformation campaign against US-made coronavirus vaccines to boost its own homegrown jab as “absurd and groundless”. The comments come a day after Washington alleged Russian intelligence was behind four websites involved in a campaign to undermine US-made vaccines, accusing Russia of putting lives at risk. Russian president Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the allegations “absurd and groundless”. “Russia has never taken part and is not going to take part in such information campaigns against other vaccines,” he told reporters. On the contrary, he said, Russia was cooperating with foreign vaccine producers “to make a more effective product”. Putin has boasted that Russia has developed the world’s best vaccines against the coronavirus, insisting last week they were better than the Pfizer and AstraZeneca jabs. 12.45pm GMT Grounds to ease Denmark lockdown, says health minister Denmark’s health minister Magnus Heunicke has said there were grounds to ease restrictions further since the epidemic was not worsening in the Nordic country. “The contact number is calculated at 1.0. That means that the epidemic in Denmark is not growing. Thus, we have the basis for further controlled reopening,” Magnus Heunicke said on Twitter. Kontakttallet er beregnet til 1,0. Betyder at epidemien i DK ikke er i vækst. Dermed har vi grundlaget for yderligere kontrolleret genåbning. Vores sekventering viser at B117 nu udgør 80% af epidemien, og med et kontakttal på 1,14 vinder den stadig frem (data tom 28/2) #COVID19dk pic.twitter.com/pXOurN0uZL — Magnus Heunicke (@Heunicke) March 9, 2021 The contact number, also known as the R-value, indicates how many people one infected person will pass the virus on to. Heunicke also said the more contagious B.1.1.7. variant, first identified in Britain, was found in around 80% of all positive cases. Denmark has already eased some of its tough lockdown measures introduced in December, as schools in some parts of the country have reopened, as well as shops, and outdoor leisure activities have resumed. Head of the state Serum Institute, Henrik Ullum, said late yesterday the partial reopening so far had not led the epidemic towards the worst-case scenario, where up to almost 900 hospitalisation could happen in April. Updated at 1.02pm GMT 12.32pm GMT An Italian-Swiss pharmaceutical company has agreed to produce Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine in Italy, the first such deal in the EU, a trade body has said. “The vaccine will be produced from July 2021 in [pharmaceutical company] Adienne factories in Lombardy,” northern Italy, a spokesman for the Italian-Russian chamber of commerce, Stefano Maggi, told AFP. “Ten million doses will be produced between July 1 and January 1, 2022,” he added, describing it as the “first agreement on the European level for the production on EU territory of the Sputnik vaccine”. Several EU countries have already begun distributing Sputnik V, but it has yet to be approved by the bloc’s medicines regulator. Last week the Amsterdam-based European Medicines Agency launched a rolling review of the Sputnik V vaccine, a key step towards being approved as the first non-Western jab to be used against the coronavirus across the 27-nation bloc. “If the vaccine is not authorised in Europe by July 1, the doses produced [in Italy] will be bought by the Russian sovereign fund and distributed in countries where the Sputnik vaccine is authorised,” Maggi said. 12.28pm GMT The government in Malawi announced a Covid emergency relief plan way back in April, but it is only now being disbursed, AFP reports. The package was initially earmarked for one million vulnerable people and small businesses hit by the coronavirus pandemic, over a three-month period. But in between, governments changed and a new administration narrowed down the number of beneficiaries for the 9.5-billion- kwacha ($25-million) package to around 200,000. The package and its late disbursement are rooted in the country’s poverty and a bout of political turmoil. A court last year barred government from imposing a lockdown on grounds there were insufficient measures to cushion loss of livelihood in one of the world’s poorest countries. As a result, the president at the time, Peter Mutharika, vowed to pay the equivalent of $40 monthly to the most vulnerable workers, matching the country’s minimum wage. But two months after the pledge, he was ousted through a court-sanctioned re-election and beaten by opposition leader Lazarus Chakwera. A separate state-funded Covid-19 package meant to buy protective gear for health workers and teachers, was recently hit by scandal when it emerged that most of the 6.5 billion kwacha went to pay personal allowances and hosting workshops for government officials. Malawi has so far counted 32,469 Covid-19 cases, of which just over 1,000 have been fatalities. 12.18pm GMT Bosnia’s foreign minister has said she and her compatriots were “justifiably unhappy” after failing to yet to receive any of the promised vaccines from the EU-backed Covax scheme. Bisera Turkovic told a press conference during a visit to Berlin: We expect Covax to fulfil its contractual obligations ... Our citizens are justifiably unhappy ... Every day counts. We’re talking about people’s lives. She said Bosnia had met its obligations and paid for more than 1.2 million doses through the international Covax scheme, a global vaccine-sharing effort, but “not a single dose” had arrived to date. The Balkan nation of 3.5 million people has recorded more than 5,000 deaths from Covid-19. Bosnian authorities have looked elsewhere for help, procuring some 22,000 doses of the Russian-made Sputnik V which is being doled out in the country’s Serb-dominated half, Republika Srpska. Neighbouring Serbia last week donated 10,000 AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccines, which will be distributed in the country’s other post-war entity, the Croat-Muslim federation. 12.09pm GMT Norway has recommended that AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine be used for people over the age of 65 in light of new studies amid hopes it would speed up vaccinations of the elderly. AFP reports: The Nordic country had initially restricted the use of the vaccine to those under the age of 65 on the grounds that the Anglo-Swedish firm had not conducted enough research on people above that age. Following in the footsteps of France, Germany, Italy and several Nordic neighbours, Norway’s public health agency said it was now recommending the vaccine for all people over the age of 18, based on British studies now conducted on elderly people. The government said it would follow the agency’s recommendation. Norway also wants to increase the waiting period between the first and second doses of the Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna vaccines from three to six weeks, a move that still requires a final approval from the public health agency. While the country has one of the lowest incidence rates in Europe, the number of cases has risen steeply lately. Norway has reported 632 Covid-related deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. 11.53am GMT Hungarian hospitals are under increasing strain as the number of coronavirus patients rose to 8,270 today, exceeding a peak in December reached during the second wave of the pandemic, the country’s surgeon general has told a briefing. Cecilia Muller said infections were expected to rise further in coming days, Reuters reports. Hungary imposed strict new lockdown measures yesterday in an attempt to curb a rise in infections and has accelerated its vaccination campaign. 11.31am GMT Domino’s Pizza has reported higher year-on-year profits in the UK and unveiled plans for more outlets and drive-thru services, as the Covid-19 pandemic prompted more people to order meals, especially over the festive period and during televised government press conferences. The profit figure includes £9m of Covid-19-related costs such as face masks and contact-free delivery boxes. The company designed a new platform box that pizzas and other food are placed on and left on customers’ doorsteps. Related: Domino’s Pizza plans more outlets as Covid-19 lockdown fuels sales 10.43am GMT The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the international financial talking shop, has increased its global growth forecast, citing the deployment of coronavirus vaccines and a huge economic stimulus programme in the US as reasons for greater optimism. The Paris-based organisations said it expects the global economy to grow 5.6%, an increase of 1.4 percentage points from its December forecast. It said in its economic outlook report published on Tuesday: Global economic prospects have improved markedly in recent months, helped by the gradual deployment of effective vaccines, announcements of additional fiscal support in some countries, and signs that economies are coping better with measures to suppress the virus. Global #GDP will grow by 5.6% this year, an upward revision of more than 1 percentage point since our last projection in Dec 2020. GDP growth by country ⬇️ \uD83C\uDD95 OECD Interim #EconomicOutlook: https://t.co/CaYycpMSjv pic.twitter.com/pcwjUUmK01 — OECD ➡️ Better policies for better lives (@OECD) March 9, 2021 The recovery will be largely led by the US thanks to Joe Biden’s $1.9tr stimulus programme, Laurence Boone, chief economist of the OECD, told AFP. However, the report noted that the recovery would be uneven and that “sizeable risks remain”. It said: There are increasing signs of divergence across countries and sectors. Strict containment measures will hold back growth in some countries and service sectors in the near term, while others will benefit from effective public health policies, faster vaccine deployment and strong policy support. Sizeable risks remain. Faster progress in vaccine deployment in all countries would enable restrictions to be lifted more quickly and enhance confidence and spending. Slow progress in vaccine rollout and the emergence of new virus mutations resistant to existing vaccines would result in a weaker recovery, larger job losses and more business failures. Updated at 11.12am GMT 10.21am GMT Batch of Oxford vaccine suspected of link to Austrian nurse's death went to 17 countries Seventeen European countries received doses from a batch of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine that authorities in Austria have stopped using while investigating a death and an illness, a senior health official has told Reuters. The warning came after a 49-year-old nurse in Zwettl, a town north-west of Vienna, died as a result of severe coagulation disorders after receiving the vaccine. Another nurse from Zwettl who is 35 and received a dose from the same batch, ABV 5300, developed a pulmonary embolism and is recovering. Christa Wirthumer-Hoche, the head of Austrian public health agency AGES’ medicines market supervisory body, was quoted by Reuters as saying: We informed all European colleagues in the European network as this batch, which amounted to roughly a million doses in total, was sent to 17 European countries. The European Medicines Agency’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), which monitors the safety of medicines, discussed the case on Monday, said Wirthumer-Hoche, who also heads EMA’s management board. AstraZeneca has said all batches of its coronavirus vaccine are subject to strict and rigorous quality controls and that there have been “no confirmed serious adverse events associated with the vaccine”. Meanwhile, an autopsy of the nurse is being carried out and Wirthumer-Hoche said she expected the results next week. Updated at 11.13am GMT 10.00am GMT India’s federal government has denied any shortage of coronavirus vaccine doses after a north-western state became the first to publicly request supplies to be urgently restocked. The country, which is the world’s biggest vaccine maker, has given 23m doses to 17 million people. As has risen after a slow start and initial hesitation among people, Rajasthan publicly requested more stock. But the federal health ministry said there was no shortage in Rajasthan or anywhere in the country. It said Rajasthan, a state of about 70m people, still had 1.4m doses left on Monday night. The ministry said in a statement: The factual position is that there is no shortage of Covid-19 vaccine with the state at present. The central government is regularly monitoring availability of vaccine supply in all states and (federal territories), and providing the doses as per their requirement and consumption pattern.

Photograph: Himanshu Sharma/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 11.14am GMT 9.31am GMT The prime ministers of Hungary and the Czech Republic, both of which are high on the scale of coronavirus death rates, will meet the prime minister of Israel to discuss policies to counter the pandemic. The meeting to be held on Thursday comes as central Europe deals with a third wave of Covid-19 that has made it a global pandemic hotspot. “The main topic of the meeting will be the effort to curb the pandemic,” the office of Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister, said in a statement seen by Reuters. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has made Israel’s vaccination programme a showcase of his campaign for re-election on 23 March. He has said 90% of eligible Israelis have either received at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine or recovered from the virus. Hungary imposed tough new lockdown measures on Monday to curb a rise in Covid-19 infections and has accelerated its vaccination campaign. Orban’s government has closed all schools and most shops. The Czech Republic, with hospitals reaching capacity due to the pandemic, has asked Germany, Poland and Switzerland to take in some Covid patients. Prague has sought to turn the tide with a strict lockdown restricting travel around the country and has boosted testing at industrial companies that have been untouched by restrictions.

Photograph: Michal Čížek/AFP/Getty Images 8.44am GMT The developers of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine have questioned the neutrality of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) after an EMA official urged EU members to hold off approving the vaccine. On Sunday, the head of the EMA’s management board, Christa Wirthumer-Hoche, told a talkshow on Austrian broadcaster ORF she “would urgently advise against giving a national emergency authorisation” to the Sputnik V shot. The Sputnik developers wrote a statement in response to Wirthumer-Hoche on the vaccine Twitter account: We demand a public apology from EMA’s Christa Wirthumer-Hoche for her negative comments on EU states directly approving Sputnik V. Her comments raise serious questions about possible political interference in the ongoing EMA review. Sputnik V is approved by 46 nations. — Sputnik V (@sputnikvaccine) March 8, 2021 EMA did not allow such statements about any other vaccine. Such comments are inappropriate and undermine credibility of EMA and its review process.

EU officials have said Brussels could start negotiations with a vaccine maker if at least four member countries request it. Updated at 9.55am GMT 8.19am GMT Jerome Salomon, France’s director of health, has said that authorities are not considering a regional lockdown around Paris, despite strain on hospitals in and around the city due to the spread of coronavirus variants. On Monday medical directors in the region had ordered hospitals to cancel 40% of their regular procedures to make space for Covid patients. In spite of that, Salomon was quoted by Reuters as telling French radio station RTL: A lockdown in the greater Paris region is not on the agenda. Lockdown is a last resort measure that would be submitted to the government and the president if we were under the impression the hospital system could not cope, The Paris region accounts for about one-sixth of France’s population According to Reuters the number of people treated in French intensive care units for Covid-19 reached a 14-1/2-week-high on Monday, at 3,849. That figure is close to 1,000 in the Paris region. 8.12am GMT Russia reported 9,445 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, the first time since early October that the daily tally has dropped below 10,000, Reuters reports. That took the total number of coronavirus infections in Russia to 4,342,474. Authorities said 336 people had died in the last 24 hours, pushing the official death toll to 89,809. Updated at 2.53pm GMT 8.01am GMT Matt Hancock, the UK health secretary, has described the closure of England’s Nightingale hospitals as an “important moment in our national recovery”. In a video posted to Twitter, Hancock said the hospitals were a “monument to this country’s ability to get things done fast when it really matters” and played a “critical role” in the UK’s response to the Covid outbreak. Speaking in a somewhat strained, awkward and hesitant manner, apparently reading the words out from an autocue, Hancock said: Built in just a matter of days, they gave us the confidence that the NHS would fulfil its timeless promise always to be there for you, to care for you and your family. Thanks to the vaccine rollout & our national effort, we can now stand down our Nightingale hospitals This is such an important moment in our national recovery THANK YOU to all involved in this incredible project pic.twitter.com/DdzS27b884 — Matt Hancock (@MattHancock) March 9, 2021 In replies beneath his tweet, Hancock was criticised for dishonesty. As my colleague Nadeem Badshah reported last night, the network of seven hospitals was barely used. The showpiece east London site treated only 54 patients in the first wave and was hamstrung by hospitals’ reluctance to release doctors and nurses to work there. It reopened in January and was used to treat non-coronavirus patients to free up beds for a surge in Covid cases and other serious illnesses. North Yorkshire’s 500-bed Nightingale hospital at Harrogate convention centre, opened by Captain Sir Tom Moore last April, will close without treating a single patient and will operate as a testing centre until then. Related: NHS Nightingale hospitals to close from next month Updated at 9.56am GMT 7.43am GMT Of all the countries to post coronavirus numbers so far today, the Czech Republic reports the highest numbers of infections, with 10,466 new cases and 110 new deaths. So far the country has reported a total 1,335,815 confirmed cases of coronavirus, the fourth highest rate of infection in the world per million people, according to figures collated by the Worldometers website. Its 22,147 deaths gives the country the world’s third highest per capita death rate from the virus. Updated at 2.53pm GMT 7.29am GMT Public health authorities in Germany this morning report the country’s smallest rise in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases since last October. The number of confirmed cases in Germany by 4,252 to 2,509,445, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed. According to the tally kept by the Worldometers website that is the lowest daily number since 11 October. The reported death toll rose by 255 to 72,189, the tally showed. 7.22am GMT Ministers must start war-gaming the next pandemic and their plans should be independently audited to prove the UK is prepared for global health threats to come, the Labour party has said, writes our chief political correspondent, Jessica Elgot, this morning. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, will give a speech on Tuesday attempting to refocus the blame for the catastrophic UK death toll on government failings, after polls showed support for Boris Johnson surging on the back of the the vaccine programme.

Reuters reports that this is partly due to logistical bottlenecks, but also because some French people don’t trust the AstraZeneca shot - despite multiple scientific studies that indicate it is safe and effective - according to interviews Reuters conducted with eight people involved in France’s vaccine rollout. 6.50am GMT That’s it from me, your faithful blogger, for today. May I suggest reading this brilliant column (that I wrote): Related: Daddy longlegs: there is one piece of information every child will know | Helen Sullivan 6.46am GMT China launches virus passport China has launched a health certificate programme for domestic travellers, leading the world in plans for so-called virus passports, AFP reports. The digital certificate, which shows a user’s vaccination status and virus test results, is available for Chinese citizens via a programme on Chinese social media platform WeChat that was launched on Monday. The certificate is being rolled out “to help promote world economic recovery and facilitate cross-border travel,” a foreign ministry spokesman said. However, the international health certificate is available only for use by Chinese citizens and it is not yet mandatory. The certificate, which is also available in paper form, is thought to be the world’s first known “virus passport”. The US and Britain are among countries considering implementing similar permits. The European Union is also working on a vaccine “green pass” that would allow citizens to travel between member countries and abroad. China’s programme includes an encrypted QR code that allows each country to obtain a travellers’ health information, state media agency Xinhua reported Monday. “QR health codes” within WeChat and other Chinese smartphone apps are already required to gain entry to domestic transport and many public spaces in China. The apps track a user’s location and produce a “green” code – synonymous with good health – if a user has not been in close contact with a confirmed case or has not travelled to a virus hotspot. The system has sparked privacy concerns and fears it marks an expansion of government surveillance. Updated at 6.53am GMT 6.43am GMT Summary Here are the key developments from the last few hours: The Covid vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE was able to neutralise a new variant of the coronavirus spreading rapidly in Brazil, according to a laboratory study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Monday. US airlines asked Biden to back Covid travel guidelines. Major US aviation, travel and aerospace groups on Monday joined airline unions in urging the Biden administration to help establish temporary Covid health credentials to boost travel, which has been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic. US House will take up Senate’s $1.9tn coronavirus bill by Wednesday - Pelosi. The US House of Representatives will take up by Wednesday the Senate version of the sweeping $1.9tn coronavirus relief package backed by President Joe Biden, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Monday. A Post-Covid consumer spending boom ‘implausible’, said a Treasury official. The prospects for a consumer spending boom after lockdown have been downplayed by a senior Treasury official, amid warnings that wealthier families have saved more than low-paid workers during the pandemic. China’s Sinovac jab is effective against Brazil variant, preliminary study suggests. Preliminary data from a study in Brazil indicates that the Covid-19 vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd is effective against the P1 variant of the virus first discovered in Brazil, a source familiar with the study told Reuters on Monday. Japan’s Terumo says it has made a syringe to draw 7 doses from Pfizer vaccine vials. Japan’s Terumo Corp said on Tuesday it has developed a new syringe that can get seven doses out of each vial of Covid vaccine made by Pfizer Inc , at least one more than accessible with existing syringes, Reuters reports.

Seven of the temporary hospitals were hastily constructed in England, starting last April with a 4,000-bed facility at London’s ExCeL centre. However, the showpiece east London site treated only 54 patients in the first wave and was hamstrung by hospitals’ reluctance to release doctors and nurses to work there.

The Covid-19 response minister, Chris Hipkins, announced the formation of the body on Tuesday, following criticism of the government’s handling of a cluster of coronavirus cases in Auckland. The city went into lockdown twice last month after confirmed cases were revealed to have defied stay-at-home orders, prompting the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, to voice frustration with rule-breakers. That, in turn, led to criticism of the government’s communication and outreach strategy from South Auckland community leaders, its political opponents, and media: Related: New Zealand orders review into handling of Covid to 'sharpen' response 5.55am GMT Animal news break: Related: Albatross faceplants to fame on New Zealand livestream 5.28am GMT Japan's Terumo says makes syringe to draw 7 doses from Pfizer vaccine vials Japan’s Terumo Corp said on Tuesday it has developed a new syringe that can get seven doses out of each vial of Covid vaccine made by Pfizer Inc , at least one more than accessible with existing syringes, Reuters reports. The health ministry approved the design on Friday, and Terumo will begin production at the end of March, a Terumo spokesman told Reuters. The Kyodo News agency, which first reported the development, said Terumo is aiming to make 20 million units this year. The vaccine made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, is shipped in vials initially indicated to hold five doses. Six doses can be drawn with special syringes, call low dead space, which minimise the amount of vaccine left in the syringe after use. Japan began its Covid inoculation campaign last month, using Pfizer’s vaccine. Taro Kono, the minister in charge of the effort, said on Friday that some shots may go to waste amid a shortage of the specialty syringes. 4.12am GMT New Zealand has opened its first large vaccination clinic as it scales up efforts to protect people from the coronavirus, AP reports. The clinic in south Auckland will initially target household members of border workers. New Zealand has stamped out community spread of the virus and considers border workers and their families the most vulnerable to catching the disease from infectious travellers. Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said that initially about 150 people a day will get vaccinated at the clinic, although the numbers will be rapidly increased. Health officials plan to open two more clinics in Auckland over the next few weeks. “I know a lot of our old people are probably scared of getting the vaccine but getting it today, it doesn’t hurt, and it is important for everybody to get it,” said Denise Fogasavaii, the sister of an Air New Zealand employee who has already been vaccinated. New Zealand this week announced it plans to use the Pfizer vaccine for all inoculations, and it hopes to complete its vaccination program by the end of the year. 3.42am GMT As the Czech Republic struggles to cope with the world’s highest coronavirus infection rate, a tidal wave of disinformation and a bungled government response are hampering vaccination efforts, AFP reports. From pseudo-scientific videos explaining how vaccines can “change your DNA” to panic-inducing stories of seniors dying en masse after receiving the jab, fake stories have overwhelmed Czech social media, messaging apps and chain mail. “Czech readers are exposed to lies about the Pfizer vaccine 25 times more than readers in the US,” said Frantisek Vrabel, the founder and CEO of Semantic Visions, which identifies potential disinformation based on the use of language patterns online. His company, whose clients include the US State Department, monitors about 5,000 disinformation sources in the Czech Republic alone, and more than a million worldwide. The “Czech Elves”, a loosely connected network of several hundred volunteers, have also been keeping track of the biggest fake news spreaders. “For years, fake news here was dominated by immigration, because it had the potential to scare people,” said Bohumil Kartous, a spokesman for the group. “Then Covid arrived, and the amount of disinformation just exploded.” Updated at 3.16pm GMT 3.21am GMT The French Pacific territories of New Caledonia and Wallis & Futuna have been forced into sudden lockdowns with Covid-19 outbreaks across both archipelagoes. New Caledonia went into an immediate lockdown from midnight Tuesday after nine cases were detected in Noumea, with the source of infection believed to be passengers who had arrived from Wallis & Futuna. Wallis & Futuna – a collection of islands between Fiji and Samoa – was rushed into a fortnight-long lockdown from Tuesday morning, after testing on Monday revealed 12 coronavirus cases in the community. Previously, the two territories were the only French territories in the Pacific to remain Covid-free. Travel between the two territories had been unrestricted (outsiders were required to quarantine) but all flights have now been suspended. People wear protective facemask as they sit, facing the ocean, on Noumea, the New Caledonian capital. Previously Covid-free, the French territory has now recorded nine cases.

Closing in on final approval of one of the biggest US anti-poverty measures since the 1960s, Democrats aim to enact the legislation by Sunday, when enhanced federal unemployment benefits are set to expire. The Senate passed its version of the bill after a marathon overnight vote on Saturday. The Senate version eliminated or pared back some provisions included in the House bill, which had increased the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and extended expanded jobless assistance through 29 August. Now that it has passed the Senate, it must be approved again by the House before it can make its way to Biden’s desk and be signed into law. Pelosi told reporters at the Capitol that the timing of a vote on the House floor “depends on when we get the paper from the Senate”. “We’d take it up Wednesday morning at the latest,” she said.

Election workers and volunteers needed written proof from local councils. Restaurants, bars and cannabis coffee shops will remain takeaway only, as they have done since October, said Rutte. But other restrictions will be slightly relaxed, including more customers allowed in large shops. Schools have already reopened in recent weeks. A Dutch appeals court upheld the coronavirus curfew in February after a lower court ruled that it was illegal and should immediately be lifted. Updated at 3.13pm GMT 1.50am GMT Greece mourns youngest Covid victim, 37-day-old baby Greece on Monday mourned the death of a 37-day-old baby, the youngest of the country’s nearly 6,800 Covid-19 victims, AFP reports. “Sadly today we had the pandemic’s youngest victim in our country, an infant that spent 17 of its 37 days fighting the coronavirus,” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted. “Today, grief is unbearable,” he said. The health ministry said the baby boy was brought to an Athens children’s hospital in mid-February with a nasal inflammation and fever, and was placed in intensive care a day later. He died on Sunday. Nearly 6,800 people have died of the virus in Greece, while nearly 480 people are in intensive care. The health ministry last week said it was calling for additional private hospital resources as it admitted that the public health system in Athens was under “unbearable pressure”. Updated at 3.13pm GMT 1.36am GMT Tunisia set to receive first coronavirus jabs Tunisia said Monday the first coronavirus vaccines were set to arrive to start mass inoculation in the north African nation using Russia’s Sputnik V jabs, AGP reports. An initial 30,000 doses are due to arrive on Tuesday from Russia, followed by 500,000 doses “in coming weeks”, a presidency statement read, citing “constant diplomatic efforts” to procure them. Tunisia, which has 11.7 million inhabitants and has recorded 237,704 Covid-19 cases including 8,201 deaths since the pandemic began, will be one of the last north African nations to start vaccinations. The government had previously announced it was expecting an initial 94,000 doses of Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca/Oxford jabs from mid-February, but delivery under the UN-led Covax scheme was delayed. Beijing last month also pledged to gift 100,000 doses. A vaccination campaign is expected to begin in coming days. Lockdown measures remain in place, although rules have been eased slightly with an overnight curfew now starting at 10pm instead of 8pm. For travellers, mandatory quarantine at a hotel has been replaced by self-isolation at home for 48 hours. Updated at 3.13pm GMT 1.10am GMT China’s Sinovac jab effective against Brazil variant, preliminary study suggests Preliminary data from a study in Brazil indicates that the Covid-19 vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd is effective against the P1 variant of the virus first discovered in Brazil, a source familiar with the study told Reuters on Monday. The source, who did not provide data details, said the study had tested the blood of vaccinated people against the Brazilian variant of the virus. Coronavac, as the Sinovac shot is known, is the main vaccine currently being used to inoculate people in Brazil. 12.52am GMT Post-Covid consumer spending boom 'implausible', says Treasury official The prospects for a consumer spending boom after lockdown have been downplayed by a senior Treasury official, amid warnings that wealthier families have saved more than low-paid workers during the pandemic. Charlie Bean, a former Bank of England deputy governor who sits on the government’s budget responsibility committee, said it would take several years for households to spend £180bn in extra savings accumulated mainly by retirees and higher-paid workers during the crisis. Casting doubt over forecasts for rapid growth in spending once Covid rules have been relaxed, he told MPs on the Commons Treasury committee: “The idea that people will make up for lost consumption by spending it all over the next few quarters once the economy has reopened, I find implausible. It is much more likely it’ll be spread out over several years.” Ministers are hoping such a surge could kickstart Britain’s economic recovery once lockdown restrictions have been removed this summer. Andy Haldane, the Bank’s chief economist, argued in a Daily Mail article last month that the economy could benefit from “enormous amounts of pent-up financial energy waiting to be released, like a coiled spring” as shop, pubs and restaurants reopen.

In a letter to the White House Covid recovery coordinator Jeff Zients, trade group Airlines for America, the US Chamber of Commerce and the US Travel Association urged the administration to work with industry to “quickly develop uniform, targeted federal guidance for temporary Covid health credentials (CHC) covering both tests and vaccinations”. The groups also said: “Covid vaccines should not be a requirement for domestic or international travel.” The White House did not immediately comment. Updated at 3.01pm GMT 12.08am GMT Pfizer vaccine effective against Brazil variant The Covid vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE was able to neutralise a new variant of the coronavirus spreading rapidly in Brazil, according to a laboratory study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Monday. Reuters: Blood taken from people who had been given the vaccine neutralised an engineered version of the virus that contained the same mutations carried on the spike portion of the highly contagious P.1 variant first identified in Brazil, the study conducted by scientists from the companies and the University of Texas Medical Branch found. The scientists said the neutralising ability was roughly equivalent the vaccine’s effect on a previous less contagious version of the virus from last year. The spike, used by the virus to enter human cells, is the primary target of many Covid vaccines. In previously published studies, Pfizer had found that its vaccine neutralised other more contagious variants first identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa, although the South African variant may reduce protective antibodies elicited by the vaccine. Pfizer has said it believes its current vaccine is highly likely to still protect against the South African variant. However, the drugmaker is planning to test a third booster dose of their vaccine as well as a version retooled specifically to combat the variant in order to better understand the immune response. 11.49pm GMT Summary Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. I’ll be bringing you the latest developments for the next few hours. I will also be posting some fun stories (headless slugs; are daddy long legs poisonous) to give everyone a much-needed break. So rest assured you will be informed and entertained. You can find me on Twitter @helenrsullivan if you feel I am not meeting my obligations as outlined. Onto the news of the day. The Covid vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE was able to neutralise a new variant of the coronavirus spreading rapidly in Brazil, according to a laboratory study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Monday. Major US aviation, travel and aerospace groups on Monday joined airline unions in urging the Biden administration to help establish temporary Covid health credentials to boost travel, which has been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Other key recent developments include: The reopening of schools in England will have an impact on infection rates that could affect the roadmap for lifting restrictions, prime minister Boris Johnson has warned, despite the number of new cases recorded in the UK having fallen to its lowest total since late September. Fully-vaccinated Americans can gather with other vaccinated people indoors without wearing a mask or social distancing. The pandemic has had an “extremely unfair” impact on the income and economic opportunities of women, US treasury secretary Janet Yellen said on Monday. Most Dutch coronavirus restrictions must remain in place for now, prime minister Mark Rutte said on Monday, with the evening curfew being extended until 31 March and foreign travel advised against until mid April. Italy’s coronavirus death toll eclipsed 100,000 on Monday, as prime minister Mario Draghi reiterated his pledge to speed up the vaccination programme. Italy approved the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine for people aged over 65 on Monday, after the Italian government had initially blocked the use for over-65s over doubts regarding the vaccine’s efficacy for that age group and a lack of data. Preliminary data from a study in Brazil indicates that the Covid-19 vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd is effective against the P1 variant of the virus first discovered in Brazil. The EU’s executive criticised Belgium on Monday for extending its blanket ban on non-essential travel to and from the country despite the European commission asking it to ease restrictions on movement. The US federal government should be able to launch the delivery of $1,400 checks to around 160m American households almost immediately, once Congress finalises the new coronavirus aid bill and president Joe Biden signs it. High schools in New York City will welcome students back to the classroom for in-person instruction on 22 March, mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday.

The house belonged to my great-grandmother and I went there every summer as a child. Now I want my own children, aged 12 and nine, to have a connection to the land. We plant trees, pick grapes from our vines. They have a freedom there that they don’t have in the city. Very few foreign visitors make it here and most Portuguese prefer to go to the beach, so it is very quiet. It’s much greener than the Alentejo, to the south – people sometimes call Ribatejo the Tuscany of Portugal – and it’s also cooler than the south. The nights are usually fresh. When we bring friends here they can’t believe how beautiful it is. Silvia Bastos and family on holiday Photograph: handout One of the best things to do is spend the day by the Zêzere River or Castelo do Bode, a 66km-long lake formed in the 1950s when the river was dammed. In the past few years the lake has become more geared up for tourism and now there are places offering water sports, such as wake boarding at Lago Azul in the town of Ferreria do Zêzere. An unexpected attraction is the famed dinosaur footprints at Pedreira do Galinha, 20km west of Tomar, discovered in 1994. Tomar itself is beautiful, with one of the best monuments in the country – the vast, Unesco-listed Convent of Christ, originally a 12th-century Templar stronghold. It’s surrounded by castle walls and its various cloisters were built over several centuries, in different architectural styles. We usually eat at home because we have planted so many fruit trees and plants, as well as vines, and it’s great to eat – and drink – what we grow, but in Tomar there’s a fun medieval-themed restaurant, Taverna Antiqua, that serves traditional dishes, like boar with wild berries. Grelha do Zêzere in Ferreria do Zêzere is also great – it serves regional cuisine, especially grilled meat. Tomar and the river are jewels of Portugal, yet few people explore them. • Stay at Quinta da Anunciada (doubles €65-90), a historic country house with pool, 2km from Tomar Interview by Isabel Choat Czech Republic: Orlické mountains Ondřej Vach, 36, from Prague Jana and daughter near Pastivny Dam Photograph: handout I spent my childhood holidays at my grandfather’s cottage in the Orlické mountains, and though I have always lived in Prague, it’s the place I consider my true home. The region, about a two-hour drive east of the capital, is attractive yet very humble, full of forests, cycle paths and nature reserves – and completely under the radar. There are no big hotels or expensive restaurants; it’s a peripheral tourist area where Czechs walk or have fun in the wild river – and that’s why I like it. I have been returning there with my wife, Jana, since I met her in 2012, and now that we have two small daughters – Janička, aged three, and Klárka, three months – we head there for our family holiday each summer. The iconic symbol of Orlické is undoubtedly Masaryk’s Chalet (Masarykova chata na Šerlicku), a three-storey green cottage built in the mid-1920s in honour of the first president of Czechoslovakia, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. During the second world war it was seized and used as a place of recovery for injured Nazi pilots, then the communists occupied it until after the revolution in 1989. It’s a fascinating site to walk to, with peaceful, unspoiled nature all around – and you can stay in lodge-style rooms for a good price, too (€14pp with breakfast). Pastviny Dam. Photograph: Alamy The Pastviny Dam (Vodní nádrž Pastviny), on the Divoká Orlice river, is another great place to visit, especially with kids. It’s 6km long, and is the last stone-made dam in the Czech Republic. It’s incredibly beautiful. My grandpa’s cottage was in this valley, it’s where I learned to swim. You can hire rowing or pedal boats, or just splash around in the clear water. A good base for exploring the region, and where we usually stay, is Žamberk, known as the gateway to the Orlické mountains. It’s a modest but pretty town with a rural atmosphere. There are two great restaurants – Imrvere, a very typical Czech restaurant, which does excellent roast duck with dumplings, and Kanec, which is also the local brewery pub. The name means wild boar, and I often head there for their strong, unfiltered lager and a plate of utopenec (pickled sausage). Oh, and do you know the British band Reef? Singer Gary Stringer and bassist Jack Bessant played at Žamberk’s JamRock festival a few years ago and were so impressed by the area they wrote a song called Road to Žamberk – then came back and played the festival for free the following year! Interview by Mark Pickering Denmark: Helgenæs peninsula, Jutland Esben Thorup, 37, from Copenhagen Old houses on a cobbled street in Ebeltoft. Photograph: Alamy Like many Danes, my grandfather bought a plot of land in the 1950s to build a summerhouse on. The Helgenæs peninsula is pretty rural – it’s known locally as the “snot drip” of Jutland (there’s a bump on the east coast that looks a little like a nose). It’s so off the beaten track that most Danes have never even heard of it. There are lots of fields around and it’s surprisingly hilly for Denmark. Some say it looks a little like Scotland. The house was built with two tiny bedrooms, one for my grandfather and grandmother and the other for my dad and my uncle to share, as well as a kitchen, a living room and a toilet. That was it – no bath, you just washed in the sea, 100 metres away. Because it’s on the east coast, the water is calm and it’s great for swimming. When I was small my family would spend three weeks here every summer. We swam, ate strawberries and ice-cream and the sun was always shining – at least that’s how I remember it. It isn’t fancy (although we did install an indoor shower in the 1990s) but I love it – my wife and I even got married here. We drive over from Copenhagen every summer with our three kids – aged one, four and seven – to spend time with my parents, my brothers and their families, and my uncle’s family. My dad built another small house on the same plot to fit everyone in, but there’s usually still someone sleeping on the sofa or the floor. Esben Thorup and son in Jutland Photograph: handout Not a lot goes on here – but that’s part of the attraction. To get to the house you have to go down an overgrown track, and there’s hardly any phone signal. We spend our time swimming, talking, walking and barbecuing. There are a few local artists – potters and painters mainly – who sell work from their houses. You can go windsurfing and there’s even an annual surf festival. There’s also fishing, kitesurfing and paragliding – the steep slopes leading to the beach give great uplift for catching the wind. If we’re ever in need of fancier attractions, we go to Ebletoft, an old port town 30 minutes’ drive away with a population of around 7,000 (this is “the big town”). There are a few visitor sites there, such as the glass museum, Glasmuseet Ebeltoft and Fregatten Jylland, which houses the world’s longest wooden ship. It’s also nice to just stroll around Ebeltoft’s old streets; sometimes we’ll get some craft beer from Ebeltoft brewery – they do a nice IPA. We eat pretty simply when at the summerhouse – we might pick up some salad leaves, new potatoes or fruit grown from the produce stands with honesty boxes dotted along the roads. And there’s a small fishing hut at the top of the peninsula where a fisherman and his son smoke fish and sell great seafood. I wish I could tell you what it was called and how to get hold of them, but the hut doesn’t even have a name, let alone a website. Just thinking about it brings back fond memories for me. Helgenæs is a special place that’s tightly bound to my family. It feels like “home”. • Sol Og Strand (sologstrand.com) has a selection of holiday homes in Helgennæs, starting at €302 a week in high season for a wooden cabin sleeping four Interview by Helen Russell Croatia: Premantura, Istria Daniel Dragojlović, 35, from Zagreb Aerial view of Cape Kamenjak. Photograph: Sebastian Rothe/Alamy At the end of the war in Croatia in 1995, my grandmother bought an old stone house in the village of Premantura, south of Pula. It was a safe area for my twin brother Davor and me to go, because it hadn’t been affected by the war. A cousin of ours had bought a piece of land nearby and said, “Oh, you have to come and see this little town. It’s magical.” What’s so special about this peninsula, Kamenjak, is that there is untouched nature and untouched beautiful beaches. It’s the only part of Istria that has a proper Mediterranean climate – completely different from anything else. At the far end of the peninsula are 10 to and 15-metre-high cliffs that you can jump off. There are also caves, a lighthouse and, apparently, dinosaur footprints. When we were kids we found it fascinating. It still feels magical. You take your bike or walk, to find spots where you can be on your own and not see anyone. Daniel Dragojlovic with twin brother Davor, friend Ivana and her son in Istria Photograph: Handout A favourite beach is Velika Kolombarica, whose cliffs are often featured in Croatian tourism ads. Just above it is the Safari Bar, which has a great story. This Croatian guy who used to work in Switzerland decided to live like Robinson Crusoe, so he made this bar out of practically nothing, just materials he found on the peninsula, or in the sea. We walk down to Kolombarica, jump off the cliff, go to a cave, and then go back to the bar for a drink. We usually cook at home but sometimes we’ll go inland to villages that do truffles and homemade pasta. Istria is the land of truffles. In Banjole, up the coast towards Pula, there’s a restaurant called Batelina where the chef creates dishes using types of fish and seafood that fishermen would normally throw away. It also does amazing pasta and bottarga (cured fish roe). Most of the accommodation in Premantura is private apartments and villas, but the recently opened Premantura Resort has a pool and doubles from €85-€175 B&B. We come to Premantura every August with my parents and grandmother, and we still have friends we met here when we were young kids. Some of them live in Zagreb, some in other cities in Europe, but they all have houses in Premantura and now return every year with their own families. So these connections are still going strong. Interview by Mary Novakovich Hungary: Nyíregyháza-Sóstófürdő Gréta Klibán, 38, from Budapest Sóstó Lake, Hungary Photograph: Valentyna Gupalo/Getty Images Péter and I have been together for 10 years, and for almost all that time we have spent part of our summers in Nyíregyháza-Sóstófürdő, eastern Hungary, a 2½-hour drive from Budapest. It is 60km from Debrecen, where Péter grew up, so the area is especially nostalgic for him. We are fortunate to have a house here, built by Péter’s grandparents, which gives us a deep connection to the land. Though these days, even friends from Luxembourg and Belgium join us here because they love the relaxed vibe. The centrepiece is Sóstó Lake, which is surrounded by an oak forest for nice long walks. People come to bathe and run around the track. We like to take a paddle boat out on the water. Gréta Klibán and family in Nyíregyháza-Sóstófürdő Photograph: handout Our six-year-old daughter and four-year-old son are fans of the Aquarius Experience and Park Bath, which has a wave pool, slides and thermal waters. They also like the massive Nyíregyháza Zoo, where they always head to the Oceanarium first. Tourism has really started to blossom here in recent years, and now there are lovely homes to rent and charming hotels to stay in, like Aventinus (doubles from £58). The upscale Hunguest Hotel Sóstó is opening this summer, and we are excited about checking it out. A bridge will connect it directly to Aquarius. Every day, the kids crave ice-cream, usually from the atmospheric Omnia gelateria at the bottom of an old water tower. We sometimes eat at Colorado Steakhouse, which has a kitsch American wild west feel, with lots of wood. For something lighter than steak and pulled pork, we’ll eat alfresco at Italian restaurant La Terrazza, which has magical views of the lake. Afterwards, if we are lucky, there will be live music at Krúdy Vigadó. This beautiful terrace is where everybody comes together to chat, drink, and savour summer evenings. Interview by Alia Akkam Spain: Guimerà, Catalonia Elisa Minguella, 43, from Barcelona Ruined Vallsanta Convent, near Guimerà. Photograph: Lux Populi/Getty Images Every August, I go with my husband and two daughters to Guimerà, a tiny medieval village on a hillside in a quiet, rural part of Catalonia. It’s only 130km west of Barcelona but it feels a world away from the city and the crowded beach resorts. I’ve been coming to Guimerà for as long as I can remember. My great-grandfather was the mayor there, and my father was born in the house where we stay each summer. In the winter only a couple of hundred people live there but in the summer it’s full of families, almost all of them with a connection to the village going back generations. Elisa Minguella and family. Photograph: Annette Pacey When I was a child, I would spend the entire school summer holidays in Guimerà with my brothers and my grandmother. I had complete freedom to stay out all day with my friends, and I encourage my girls to do the same now. They love the novelty of going to the bakery on their own to buy bread. In August, my whole family gathers in the village: my parents, my two brothers, uncles and my cousins with their families. It can get pretty crowded in the house, Cal Belleta. Every house in the village has a name and that’s how we know which extended family people belong to. People ask: “De quina casa ets?” (Which house are you from?) There aren’t any hotels in Guimerà but it’s possible to rent a large house for far less than it would cost in more touristy places. Cal Caig (sleeps 11, on airbnb.com) for €120 a night; and Ca l’Anxica (sleeps 12) with a private pool is €290 a night (for up to eight people) or €360 a night for up to 12. The best way to discover the local countryside is on foot via one of the many walking trails. My favourite goes along the river Corb, passing the ruins of Convent de Vallsanta. There are also many places in the area to enjoy traditional Catalan food – we go to Cal Feliuet in nearby Belltall, where we always order snails. The day out we love the most is at the medieval market of Guimerà, which is held on the second weekend of August (10-11 Aug 2019). Everyone from the village dresses up in medieval costumes and each street is dedicated to a traditional trade, such as glassmaking. At night we put on a play based on a story from the history of the village, followed by fireworks from the tower. For me, the best part of the event is the way everybody comes together to make it happen. It’s that sense of community that will keep us coming back to Guimerà. Interview by Annette Pacey Italy: Capo Circeo, Lazio Federica Cannone, 42, from Rome Stabilimento Saporetti, near San Felice Circeo Photograph: Stabilimento Saporetti My father has a house in Borgo Montenero, a small village 100km south of Rome in a pine wood surrounded by fields of watermelons and strawberries. The place is super quiet but there’s a farmers’ market every weekend, an excellent little pizzeria called La Pizza in Piazza, and a grocery store and post office. The charming coastal town of San Felice Circeo is 10 minutes’ drive away, home to Spiaggia Capo Circeo beach, a sandy strip of stabilimenti balneari (quintessentially Italian beach clubs with rows of sunbeds and umbrellas). It gets fully booked in August, often by families who have been going for generations, so my husband and I go round the headland to Saporetti beach, right by Monte Circeo. Its restaurant, Ristorante Saporetti, is on the beach: I always go for the salad niçoise and, in the evening, fantastic (if a tad pricey) fish dishes. We like coming here because we know pretty much everyone now, from other families to the lifeguard, Carmelo, who’s been there for decades, and the owners of the stabilimento. Federerica’s children, Giulia and Francesco, at Cape Circeo Photograph: handout The area is relatively unknown to foreign visitors, who tend to head further south to the Amalfi coast or stay much closer to Rome, in Ostia. It’s a shame: Circeo is super-easy to get to (you can be here in just over 1½ hours from Rome) and it really has some beautiful beaches and pristine water – the area has been awarded a blue flag for the past three years. There are plenty of places to stay: lots of agriturismi or B&Bs. One of my favourites is Podere Bedin (doubles €75-110); the owners are friendly and the restaurant uses local products. The area is part of Circeo national park, which runs along the coast of Lazio, spanning forests, marshes, sand dunes, Lake Paola, the island of Zannone and stunning sand dunes. The Istituto Pangea Onlus offers trails and trekking excursions as part of its eco-educational programme, and there’s also cave diving, lots of cycling routes, and kayaking. Water Life, a company owned by local B&B Proprietá Scalfati, (doubles from €140) is our go-to for kayaking trips. You can also get to Ponza, the largest island in the Pontine archipelago, in just an hour from the port of San Felice Circeo (boats depart everyday at around 10am). Circeo’s food and drink are also a big draw. We always go to Cantina Sant’Andrea, not far from Borgo Montenero, where you can fill your own wine bottle straight from huge casks. Aperitivos are cheap and well-done pretty much anywhere you go. We usually go to Saporetti’s St Bar for an aperol spritz at sunset, and we really like Tiki and La Terrazza, too – both in the old town of San Felice Circeo. If we aren’t eating at home, we tend to go to Il Grottino, which has branches in the old town and the port. It’s the nicest trattoria, and their linguine all’astice – with white wine, parsley, tomatoes, garlic and astice (small lobster) – is phenomenal. Locanda degli Artisti is quite popular too, and more experimental – they do things like ravioli cacio e pepe with black truffle and seafood; prawn tartare with pine nuts and orange reduction; and scallops on a mousse of mushrooms and sundried tomatoes. And Ristorante Antico Molino, by our house, specialises in buffalo meat and mozzarella. Interview by Marianna Cerini The Netherlands: South Limburg Majella van der Horst, 44, from Haarlem Restaurants in the old town of Valkenburg aan de Geul. Photograph: Chris Mueller/Getty Images Whenever we ask our children (aged 11, seven and six) where they want to go on holiday, they always say, “We want to go to Oma’s campsite,” meaning Camping ’t Geuldal, a friendly campsite surrounded by fields and woods in hilly South Limburg, where their grandmother spends six months of the year in her caravan, and where my husband holidayed as a child in the 1960s. We live in Haarlem, near Amsterdam, and compared with the city, the beautiful Geuldal region is quiet and green. You can swim in the Geul River, cycle and take long walks. Majella’s daughter, Febe, tobogganing with dad Ronald Photograph: handout For a fun outing, we go to the town of Valkenburg, which has caves and the ruins of a 12th-century castle. There’s also a chair lift from the valley station, just south of the town centre, up to a summer toboggan centre where you can rocket back down the hill through a metal half-pipe on a sort of sledge on wheels. Our kids love getting a milkshake and a slice of Limburgse vlaai (fruit tart) at Cup & Vino in the town’s historic centre, or having a pizza at La Casa, whose fries are served with the best mayo we’ve tasted (they refuse to share the recipe). Most of our time, however, is spent on the campsite. We’ve stayed there five years in a row, sometimes for up to six weeks, first in a rented chalet and now in our own caravan. All our stuff is there, so I just pack some clothes and off we go. The kids can be totally free and play outside all day or take part in on-site activities such as ball games, a mini-disco or caring for animals at the petting zoo. If the children are happy, we can relax too. I read, lie in the sun and work a bit on my laptop. As long as the kids still love it there, we’ll keep on coming. • Camping ’t Geuldal is 10km from Maastricht; tent or motorhome pitches in high season €17-22 plus €3-4pp. Holiday homes around €600 a week high season, based on four sharing Interview by Deborah Nicholls-Lee France: Finistère, Brittany Nicolas Tanguy, 50, from Nice The Glénan islands, off the coast of Finistère. Photograph: Mathieu Rivrin/Getty Images I was born in Finistère, the westernmost tip of mainland France, and loved telling people where I came from as it means the fin de terre – the end of the Earth! When I was a teenager I used to go cycling around on my own or meet my friends and we would explore the Odet river, riding past the giant blue and pink hydrangeas and on to Sainte-Marine, a tiny port on the opposite side of the estuary from Bénodet, which has since become a notable yachting centre. I left the end of the Earth to study and work in Paris, where I met my wife, who is Australian, and we’ve travelled all over the place. Now we live in Nice, south-east France, and for 15 years I never thought about going back to Brittany, but then a few years ago my wife wanted to see where I was brought up. We went back to Sainte-Marine, sat under the giant white parasols of the Café de la Cale on the waterfront and took le bac (the ferryboat) across to Bénodet for an ice-cream at Bankiz. It was just magical, so now we go back regularly. Nicolas Tanguy and pal on his bike in Brittany Photograph: Nicolas Tanguy It’s all about the simple pleasures. We always have the blé noir (buckwheat) crêpe: a complète (ham, eggs and cheese) or a caramel au beurre salé from La Misaine. If we want seafood, we have a plate of langoustines – Sainte-Marine is the French capital of langoustines, which locals affectionately call demoiselles (maidens). The day’s catch still comes in at 4pm, heralded by squawking seagulls, so we always go down to see what the côtiers (small fishing boats) have brought in. There’s a tiny, sandy beach there too. The bilingual French-Breton street signs make it feel very local and distinctive. The stone houses have slate roofs and the ambiance is part-riverbank, part-seaside. Towards the ocean and sand dunes, there are lots of protected natural areas, where very little building is allowed. On our last trip we put our dog in the bicycle basket and went riding behind the dunes to the places I used to go to as a boy. You can cycle to Île-Tudy on the opposite headland, which has a huge white sand beach. Much further west (you need a car) is La Torche, which is famous for its tulips and for holding the world windsurfing championships (it’s one of the best windsurf spots in France). Sainte-Marine has a fantastic hotel, the Villa Tri Men (doubles from €97-265 room-only,) so this year, for my birthday – a big one – we ate in the restaurant there, Les Trois Rochers, and next morning took the boat out to the beautiful Glénan islands from Bénodet (adult return €36). The whole area is perfect for puttering round in a boat. I’m even thinking about taking my boat licence! Interview by Jon Bryant Germany: Lychen, Uckermark Bert Schulz, 45, from Berlin Family boating on an Uckermark lake. Photograph: Alamy This summer will be the fourth year in a row that our family – my wife Claudia and my two daughters Rosa (nine) and Tilda (seven) – will spend our summer holiday in a beautiful place called Lychen, in the rural Uckermark region. It’s little more than an hour’s journey north of Berlin but feels like a world away. Unlike much of the rest of mostly flat Brandenburg state, it is quite hilly. Getting there from Berlin is very easy – we don’t have a car so we take a train to Fürstenberg (one hour) and then ride our bikes 15km to Lychen. Bert Schulz and family Photograph: Bert Schulz Every year we book one of two rental flats in a converted farmhouse called Hof Georgenhoehe (from €52-82 a night for two plus €9-13 each additional peron) a little outside the town. One apartment used to be pigsty and the other was a stable. The place we rent has two bedrooms, and a terrace looking out over the countryside that is lovely to sit on in the summer. The place still has a few farm animals (pigs, a couple of old Highland cows, chickens and a small flock of sheep) but these days they are kept as pets. In the morning the first thing the kids do is go and collect eggs from the chickens, then they’ll feed the pigs, visit the farm cats and so on – it is a great way for children from the city to learn more about animals. We often go for a run in the mornings and there are several lakes nearby to swim in – our favourites are Grosser Lychensee, which is walking distance from the farmhouse, and we can cycle to Wurlsee and Rutenberger See. In the town of Lychen (population 3,000) there are a couple of decent German restaurants (Gasthof am Stadttor is our favourite) and bars (the Stadtkrug and the Gaststätte zum Dicken) if we don’t feel like cooking. A bit further away is a very good Japanese-style restaurant called Tenzo Gasthof, run by people who quit Berlin for life in the countryside. With kids this age, cycling is definitely the best way for us to enjoy the region, but others explore it by canoe or houseboat – the lakes in the area are all linked and you can sail around for weeks at a time.

Food and drink prices are very low, and the people really welcoming. Lift passes at €65 for two days are great value, or just €3 if, like me, you are over 70. There’s accommodation in Rialp at the foot of the mountain or stay at Red Rock Trails near Tremp, if you want a multi-activity holiday.

It is a small town surrounded by the Bjelasica and Sinjajevina mountains, which rise to above 2,000 metres. Skiing costs from €30 a day including lift pass, and there are also children’s slopes with instructors. My seven-year-old loved it. The great-value Balkan cuisine is delicious and accommodation ranges from upmarket Hotel Bianca to reasonably priced log cabins. The ski slopes are 7km away and accessible by bus. For a winter holiday without queues and high prices, I’d really recommend the area. Ralph Bavaria, Germany Garmisch-Partenkirchen.

As the sun goes down just after midday, a lot of the skiing takes place under floodlights (and in -40C), not to mention the aurora borealis. But among our family’s favourite local touches were the small smoke huts lining the edges of some slopes. These were small log teepees with a fire burning in the middle, topped with a grill to cook your locally bought meat on.

The complete review of Serie A's 2018-19 season","body":"Not even an alien invasion could change the narrative for Italian football. Cristiano Ronaldo was hailed as an extra-terrestrial when he touched down in Turin, a five-time Ballon d’Or winner arriving in a country where no player had got close to the award since Kaká claimed it in 2007. The Portuguese forward was supposed to carry Juventus to European glory. Instead, they won an eighth consecutive Serie A title, and nothing more. Ronaldo, for the most part, delivered. He did not hit those otherworldly heights of his best years in Madrid, but 28 goals and 10 assists are hardly a pittance. His hat-trick bailed the Bianconeri out after a catastrophic first leg against Atlético Madrid in the Champions League last-16, and he struck in both legs of the quarter-final defeat by Ajax. Still, few predicted at the outset that he would finish behind Fabio Quagliarella and Duván Zapata in the scoring charts. The former turned 36 in January. The latter had never gone beyond 11 goals in his previous five seasons in Italy. Look beyond Juventus’s dominance, and this was a season packed with unexpected twists. Atalanta, playing vibrant and ambitious football, finished third – higher than ever before in their 112-year history. They outscored everyone, including Juventus, and ended the Bianconeri’s bid for a fifth-consecutive domestic double with a 3-0 Coppa Italia rout. Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks. Inter, tipped as title challengers after adding Radja Nainggolan, Stefan De Vrij and Lautaro Martínez, instead produced a re-enactment of their previous campaign – finishing with the same points and again scraping into fourth with a nerve-shredding final-day win. OK, perhaps that bit was less surprising, but the path the Nerazzurri took was something else. Eight points clear of fifth at the start of 2019, Inter had won the derby, beaten Lazio 3-0 in Rome and earned results at home to Barcelona and Tottenham, too. Then they started the year poorly and alienated their only reliable goalscorer by stripping him of the captaincy. Perhaps that was even the right thing to do. Certainly, it was not ideal for Mauro Icardi’s wife and agent, Wanda, to be taking digs at teammates on TV chat shows. Then again, it was not exactly desirable for him to write an autobiography three years ago in which he triumphantly recalled threatening to bring criminals over from Argentina to murder fans who criticised him, either, and he did not lose the armband then. Icardi is expected to leave, as Antonio Conte builds a team in his image. Milan already offloaded their own ill-fitting Argentinian striker in January. Gonzalo Higuaín was supposed to fire the Rossoneri into the Champions League. Instead his brief loan stay will be remembered for a penalty miss, red card and meltdown against parent club Juventus. Related: Gennaro Gattuso leaves Milan but tells club not to pay him for rest of contract Krzysztof Piątek fared better, though his goals dried up, too, after an astonishing start in Serie A. He joined Genoa from CS Cracovia for €4.5m last June, and was sold to Milan for almost eight times that sum half a year later. An astonishing piece of business, and also one that very nearly backfired, as the Rossoblu slid to 17th without him. They avoided relegation only thanks to a head-to-head tie-breaker over Empoli. It was sad to see the Tuscans go: a team that always sought to attack under Aurelio Andreazzoli. Perhaps, if he had not been briefly replaced by Beppe Iachini in the middle of the season, Empoli might have survived, even with the smallest wage bill in the division. Many wealthier clubs delivered less bang for their buck. Fiorentina finished just three points above the relegation zone after an extraordinary collapse. Roma, too, were a disappointment, if not quite on the same scale. Monchi and Eusebio Di Francesco were gone by the middle of March. Now Daniele De Rossi’s journey with his boyhood club has come to an end as well. There were more positive seasons for Lazio, Coppa Italia winners, and Torino, who challenged strongly for a European place, as well as Spal and Sassuolo. Bologna had some of the best results in the league after hiring Sinisa Mihajlovic as manager in January. Parma followed up three consecutive promotions by consolidating their top-flight place. Lazio celebrate after winning the Coppa Italia. Photograph: Vincenzo Pinto/AFP/Getty Images Napoli cruised to second almost as comfortably as Juventus took first. Carlo Ancelotti deserves credit for evolving the team left by Maurizio Sarri, and making better use of his squad’s depth, without slipping down the table – even if the points tally was diminished. This will be another Serie A season, however, remembered for ugly events off the pitch as well. Kalidou Koulibaly was racially abused during Napoli’s defeat at Inter. Moise Kean, a joyful late-season revelation for Juventus, was likewise targeted during a match at Cagliari. The limp reaction of the authorities – who took no action against the Sardinian club – was dispiriting. But the response of Kean’s own team-mate Leonardo Bonucci, who suggested that blame “should be split 50-50” between the teenager and his abusers, was arguably worse. Ronaldo found himself at the centre of a grim story in October, when Las Vegas police confirmed that they were re-opening investigations into a rape accusation made against him in 2009. The player denied the charge and there are conflicting reports about whether the case has been dropped. But Juventus’s response, issuing a pair of tweets that highlighted his professionalism together with the length of time since the alleged incident, was nevertheless horribly misjudged. These stories cannot be swept aside, yet it is right to celebrate the highs of the season as well. So without further ado, here are your 2019 awards … Goal of the season 6) Between injuries, car trouble and a habit for showing up late to training, Radja Nainggolan’s first year at Inter was mostly a disappointment.

Gasperini was in charge of Genoa back then, but would go on to have his own disastrous stint in charge of the Nerazzurri: fired after just five games in 2011. It took time to bounce back. But what is so impressive about Gasperini is that he continues to evolve, even at 61. For most of his career, his schemes were premised on the idea that a team should keep one defender free to mop up. At Atalanta, there is no such safety net. He has dared his players to engage in one-on-one battles, and reaped incredible rewards. Atalanta head coach Gian Piero Gasperini. Photograph: Paolo Magni/EPA Gasperini has also drawn the best out of individuals by observing qualities that others had missed. Zapata’s muscular frame led many to presume that he was best suited to acting as a target-man who could hold the ball up and bring others into play. This season, he was encouraged to play facing the goal more. He scored 23 times. Definitely not manager of the season Giampiero Ventura, out of work since failing to qualify Italy to the 2018 World Cup, returned to management with Chievo in October. He presided over three defeats and a draw before handing in his resignation. He was, as the journalist Giovanni Capuano observed, “only 363 days late”. Player of the season Ronaldo was supposed to be the signing that allowed Juventus to win the Champions League. Instead, they crashed out against Ajax. The football was often drab, and Massimiliano Allegri lost his job. Still, Ronaldo was the best individual performer in a team that won Serie A at a stroll. If Juventus were able to take 24 wins and three draws from their first 27 league games, it was in part because they had a player who could resolve everything on his own even when they were playing badly. More was hoped for. But only because the bar was set high to begin with. Cristiano Ronaldo of Juventus celebrates after scoring against Sampdoria in December.

Most self-aware After scoring the only goal in a win over Fiorentina, Frosinone’s Daniel Ciofani lamented leaving himself out of his fantasy team. He was then asked whether his friends had allowed him buy himself cheaply in the preseason auction. “They let me pay [the minimum price] €1m,” confirmed Ciofani. “Not to do me a favour, but because I’m the centre-forward for Frosinone.” Honourable mention: Kevin-Prince Boateng, asked on the eve of the season if he could be Sassuolo’s Ronaldo. “Maybe, yes. But I’m short by 500 goals.” Best choreography (by a mile …) Spal’s supporters went all-out to remind Mattia Destro of the open goal he had missed against them a season before.

Lifetime achievement awards There are not enough words left to me here to do justice to De Rossi. A magnificent midfielder in his prime, he was always more than the hard-tackling caricature implied by the tattoo on his right calf. He will not retire a one-club man like Francesco Totti. Nor did he get the chance to raise a Scudetto for Roma, as his former team-mate did. But De Rossi did get to live that glory in a different way: as fan, as a member of the academy and as a ball-boy. This was always his team, long before he ever got the chance to play in it. Roma supporters pay tribute to Daniele De Rossi. Photograph: Riccardo Antimiani/EPA It will remain so, when he returns, as promised, to watch games with a sandwich and a beer. His journey as a professional footballer is not finished quite yet, though. Perhaps the 2006 World Cup winner will find there are further trophies to be claimed away from Rome. Before we finish, though, I want to give a mention for Marek Hamsik as well. He spent 11-and-a-half years at Napoli, the last five of those as captain – surpassing Diego Maradona as the club’s all-time leading scorer. His move to China in February marked the end of an era as well; not all heroes need to be homegrown. Grazie di tutto, ragazzi. Here’s hoping the next chapter is every bit as rewarding.","Id":"football/blog/2019/jun/05/its-the-bandinis-2019-the-complete-review-of-serie-a-2018-19-season","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webTitle":"It’s the Bandinis 2019!

The Guardian’s science correspondent Nicola Davis has the story: Related: Put London in tier 3 Covid restrictions within 48 hours, expert says 10.03pm GMT Brazil registers highest daily death toll in almost a month Brazil reported another 51,088 confirmed coronavirus infection in the past 24 hours and a further 842 fatalities from Covid-19, its health ministry said on Tuesday, marking the highest daily death tally since 14 November. The country has now registered 6,674,999 cases since the pandemic began, while its official death toll has risen to 178,159, according to ministry data. Brazil has the world’s third highest case count and second highest death toll. 9.50pm GMT The US president Donald Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani on Tuesday said he is feeling better after contracting Covid-19 and expects to leave the hospital on Wednesday. The 76-year-old former New York City mayor, who is spearheading Trump’s flagging effort to overturn the president’s election loss to Joe Biden, said he began to feel unusually tired on Friday. By Sunday, when his diagnosis was announced, Giuliani said he was showing other “mild symptoms” but that currently he has no fever and only a small cough. “I think they are going to let me out tomorrow morning,” Giuliani said in an interview with WABC Radio in New York. He was at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, two sources familiar with the situation said on Sunday. Giuliani plans to attend a virtual hearing this week with Georgia lawmakers, another source familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Tuesday. With Trump’s legal effort so far failing to convince any court of the president’s claim that widespread fraud cost him the election, Giuliani has been meeting with state officials in a long-shot bid to persuade them to overturn the election results. State and federal officials have repeatedly said there is no evidence of fraud on any significant scale. In Georgia, state lawmakers are due to hold a virtual meeting on Thursday to discuss election issues, following a hearing last week in which Giuliani urged the state’s lawmakers to intervene to overturn Biden’s victory in the state. Giuliani made similar pleas last week in Michigan and Arizona. After news broke on Sunday of Giuliani’s test result, the Arizona state legislature said it would close both chambers this week out of caution “for recent cases and concerns relating to Covid-19.” Giuliani met with about a dozen Republican lawmakers there last week. In his radio interview, Giuliani said he had tested negative just before his trip to the three states. He also confirmed that Jenna Ellis, an attorney with whom he has worked side-by-side on Trump’s legal challenges, also had contracted the coronavirus. 9.26pm GMT Mariachi Rey Azteca band performing in front of the San Gerardo Mayela Church commemorating Mother’s Day in Panama City. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images 9.12pm GMT Female leaders who have stood out for their handling of the coronavirus earned honours in the annual Forbes list of the world’s 100 most powerful women, which highlighted women’s roles in battling the global pandemic. Women from prime ministers to corporate executives earned spots in the list for their achievements helping mitigate and control the deadly contagious virus, which has infected more than 67 million people and caused 1.54 million deaths, Forbes said. New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern, Taiwan’s president Tsai Ing-wen, Finland’s prime minister Sanna Marin, the European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde and Tokyo’s governor Yuriko Koike were particularly effective, it said. “Where they differ in age, nationality and job description, they are united in the ways they have been using their platforms to address the unique challenges of 2020,” Forbes said on its website. It quoted the Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg, also on the list, who said recently that “countries where human rights are respected and where women are able to reach top positions in society are also the countries that are the best-equipped to handle crises by Covid-19.” New Zealand eliminated coronavirus infections with a strict lockdown, reporting just over 2,000 cases of the virus and 25 deaths. Taiwan kept the pandemic under control after instituting strict restrictions and largely closing its borders in January, long before western countries, limiting cases of the virus to just over 700 and seven deaths, it said. Of the 17 newcomers to the Forbes list, Carol Tomé, the chief executive of United Parcel Service, where delivery volumes skyrocketed during lockdowns, and Linda Rendle, the chief executive of Clorox, which boosted production of cleaning goods, were noted for their work. At CVS Health, Karen Lynch, who becomes chief executive in February, took over the pharmacy giant’s Covid-19 response and extensive network of testing sites. In 2021, she will be responsible for overseeing vaccine distribution at the company’s nearly 10,000 US locations. Stacey Cunningham, the first woman to head the New York Stock Exchange, made the “swift” decision to shut down in-person trading as the virus was spreading in March, it said. The German chancellor Angela Merkel for a tenth consecutive year headed up the group of 100 women that also included leaders in entertainment, technology, philanthropy and finance from 30 countries. Other honourees included the US vice president-elect Kamala Harris and the UK’s Queen Elizabeth II. 8.15pm GMT Martin Kenyon, 91, was outside Guy’s Hospital in London after getting the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine when he was chanced upon by CNN correspondent Cyril Vanier. Asked how it felt to be one of the first people in the world to receive the jab, Kenyon said: I don’t think I feel much at all, except that I hope that I’m not going to have the bloody bug now. During the interview, which went viral after being shared by CNN’s Omar Jimenez on Twitter, Kenyon added that he intended to hug his family for Christmas. “I’m going home to tell them now. Nobody knows. You’re the first to know,” he told Vanier. 7.54pm GMT New confirmed coronavirus infections over the past 24 hours in France rose to 13,713 on Tuesday, up from 3,411 on Monday and 8,083 last Tuesday, health ministry data showed. On the 11th day after the government eased a nationwide lockdown, the number of people in intensive care however fell by 110 to 3,088, bringing it closer to a 2,500-3,000 government threshold that is one of the conditions for further lockdown easing. The French president Emmanuel Macron said last month that daily new infections need to fall to around 5,000 and the number of people in ICU to below 3,000 in order to lift the lockdown on 15 December. The number of cases now stands at 2.31 million. The ministry also reported that the number of people in hospital with the virus fell by 451 to 25,914, after reporting an increase the past two days. It also reported 831 new coronavirus deaths, including a four-day batch of 454 deaths in retirement homes and 377 deaths in hospitals. On Monday, it reported 366 deaths in hospitals. 6.59pm GMT Summary Coronavirus surge in US. Deaths from Covid-19 in the US have soared to more than 2,200 a day on average, matching the frightening peak reached last April.Cases per day have eclipsed 200,000 on average for the first time on record, with the crisis all but certain to get worse because of the fallout from Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s. UK reports 616 more Covid-linked deaths and 12,282 more cases. The UK government said a further 616 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Tuesday, bringing the UK total to 62,033.As of 9am on Monday, there had been a further 12,282 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK.It brings the total number of cases in the UK to 1,750,241.

Germany inched towards stricter measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus, as an eastern region said it would close schools and most businesses and the health minister warned a partial lockdown had not stopped the disease.Europe’s biggest economy is struggling to squash new infections in a second wave of Covid-19 that is both proving far more difficult to tame than the first one and extracting a heavier human toll as daily deaths hit record highs. Dutch coronavirus cases rise for first week since October. The number of new coronavirus cases in the Netherlands has resumed rising after falling for weeks, the country’s health authority has said.There were 43,103 new cases registered in the week ended 8 December, the National Institute for Health said in its weekly update, up from 33,949 in the week ended 1 December. 6.41pm GMT Canada is confident there will be no disruption of Covid-19 vaccine supplies even if the United States blocks their export because vaccines are manufactured in several countries, a minister said. This comes ahead of an expected US executive order meant to ensure Americans’ priority access to the shots. President Donald Trump’s executive order is intended to ensure priority access for Covid-19 vaccines procured by the US government, ahead of other nations, senior administration officials said on Monday. Asked about the impact of any executive order on those deliveries at a media briefing, a Canadian minister said Canada’s purchases are not tied to any one manufacturing site, and noted that Pfizer Inc is manufacturing in Europe as well as the United States. “We’re very confident that Pfizer and other vaccine makers that are contractually obligated to deliver vaccine doses to Canada will be able to meet those obligations,” said Dominic LeBlanc, minister of intergovernmental affairs. 6.29pm GMT Mexico plans to begin vaccinating its people against Covid-19 at the end of the third week of December, starting with health workers, the government announced Tuesday. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said the vaccines will be “universal and free” — and also voluntary — and he hopes the full population will be vaccinated by the end of 2021. Officials said that starting in February, those over 60 will receive vaccinations, followed by those over 50 in April and over 40 in May. They urged people with risk factors to get vaccinated first. The 67-year-old president himself said he would get vaccinated in February, along with his age group. The government already has contracted for 34.4 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and it said earlier that 250,000 of those are expected to arrive around 17 December. The armed forces will distribute them to vaccination sites, initially in Mexico City and the northern border state of Coahuila. Mexico has reported 1.18 million confirmed infections with the new coronavirus and at least 110,074 deaths from Covid-19, though both are acknowledged to be undercounts. Updated at 8.19pm GMT 6.19pm GMT Sam Foster, the chief nursing officer at Oxford’s acute hospital trust, administered the first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at the city’s Churchill hospital this morning. “I have been proud to play my part in delivering the first vaccinations on this historic day in our battle against the pandemic”, she said. Foster and a number of nurses who are experienced in vaccination together injected the vaccine into the shoulder of scores of people over 80, most of whom are outpatients, some care workers and also some NHS staff classed as high-risk because they have underlying health issues -- the first three priority groups to get the jabs. All the nurses involved are also “peer vaccinators” -- staff who usually administer the winter flu jab to colleagues in their area of care in a bid to encourage take-up. “As such they are not just skilled at administering vaccines but also at dealing with people’s anxieties and sensitivities”, a hospital source explained. Because the trust has only “limited supplies currently” of the vaccine, people from Oxfordshire, West Berkshire and Buckinghamshire wanting to be immunised should not ring their GP or the hospital and should instead wait for the NHS to contact them, Foster stressed. “This is a hugely significant moment in our pandemic response and offers hope at what has been a incredibly difficult year for us all”, said Dr Bruno Holtof (corr), the chief executive of Oxford University Hospitals (OUH) NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the Churchill. “The strict approval process it has gone through means that the approved vaccine, and any other vaccines approved in the future, will not only be safe but will be our best defence against the virus”, Holtof added. The trust chose the Churchill rather than its main hospital, the John Radcliffe Infirmary, as the location for its rollout of the vaccine because it is quieter than the JRI and has been kept Covid-free during the pandemic, because it is mainly a specialist cancer hospital.

Everyone who receives their first dose is automatically booked in at the time for their second one three weeks later. Meanwhile, in Bristol, five staff from care home operators Brunelcare became some of the first social care staff in the country to have the vaccine. “The vaccine was quick and painless, and I’d encourage anyone who has the opportunity to get the vaccine to take it”, said Lesley Hobbs, the manager of the charity’s Deerhurst care home. She and her fellow workers were immunised at the city’s Southmead hospital; 85 other colleagues are also booked in to have their first dose this week. Oona Goldsworthy, Brunelcare’s chief executive, hailed the vaccine as “the lifeline we’ve been waiting for in social care”. But, she added: “It is just the first step. We now await details of how and when the vaccine will be made available to our residents in our care homes”. 6.08pm GMT Switzerland plans to ban all public events apart from church services and legislative meetings and further limit private gatherings after 12 December as infections swell. It is starting talks with the nation’s 26 cantons over the proposals, as it prepares for the new restrictions. The announcement came as the Federal Office of Public Health reported 92 more deaths, taking the death toll in Switzerland and neighbouring Liechtenstein to 5,116. The number of cases rose by 4,262 cases to 358,568, it said. The government also plans to order restaurants, shops and markets to close at 7pm through 20 January in an effort to restrict the spread of the virus. It also aims to restrict the number of people who could meet in households to five. Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga. Photograph: Arnd Wiegmann/Reuters “The number of new infections is high and is rising again, beds in intensive care units are stretched,” the government said. “The increasingly cold temperatures and bad weather may have accelerated the infection rate.” After getting feedback from the cantons, the Swiss government plans to meet again on Friday, ahead of a decision on the new measures due to start at the weekend. “The numbers are increasing exponentially - too quickly and too strongly. We want reduce contact and the number of infections,” Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga said. “If we don’t act quickly enough, the worst of the pandemic is still to come,” she added. “Then, even more drastic measures will be needed.” 5.53pm GMT Coronavirus surge in US Deaths from Covid-19 in the US have soared to more than 2,200 a day on average, matching the frightening peak reached last April. Cases per day have eclipsed 200,000 on average for the first time on record, with the crisis all but certain to get worse because of the fallout from Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s. Virtually every state is reporting surges just as a vaccine appears days away from getting the go-ahead in the U.S. “The epidemic in the U.S. is punishing. It’s widespread. It’s quite frankly shocking to see one to two persons a minute die in the U.S. — a country with a wonderful, strong health system, amazing technological capacities,” said Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization’s chief of emergencies. The virus is blamed for more than 280,000 deaths and almost 15 million confirmed infections in the United States. 5.39pm GMT Thousands of people defied public gathering restrictions to descend on a small village in central Sri Lanka for a syrup that a self-styled holy man claimed could prevent and treat coronavirus. The country has been experiencing a surge in cases since October, with the number of infections increased more than eight-fold since then to over 28,500 and 142 dead. Carpenter Dhammika Bandara claimed on national television last week that a so-called cure had been revealed to him by a god. A man undergoes a COVID-19 blood test at an area under lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Photograph: Chamila Karunarathne/EPA But doctors in the island nation said there was no scientific basis for the syrup. There is no known cure for Covid-19. Photographs of Health Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi published in local newspapers drinking the concoction helped spread Bandara’s claim. Reporters said some 12,000 people travelled to his small village some 85 kilometres (52 miles) northeast of capital Colombo, where he announced that he would be giving away some free samples. “I am saying with sincerity that this preparation will not only cure Covid-19, but after you take this once, you will never contract the virus,” he told the crowd, without offering any evidence. Footage showed police officers unable to enforce social distancing measures in the crowds. No-one was arrested or fined. Sri Lankan courts can slap fines on people for not wearing masks in public as part of the government’s measures in combating the pandemic. In previous months, there was an attempt to use traditional medicine as a cure for Covid-19 linked fevers in Sri Lanka. But Ayurveda doctors said testing was needed before the treatment could be prescribed. 5.16pm GMT Iceland will relax some measures aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus after seeing a slight fall in new infections. Public pools and cinemas will be allowed to open at reduced capacity, while shops may allow in up to 100 people, depending on the size of the shop, the Ministry of Health said in a statement. Iceland has an infection incidence of 46.1 per 100,000 on a two-week average. Only 28 people have died with the virus in Iceland, out of 5,506 infections in total. “It is therefore clear that we have managed to control the pandemic to a reasonable extent at the moment” Iceland’s chief epidemiologist said, calling the situation “delicate”. A limit on public gatherings of 10 people will continue to be in effect, with some exceptions, the government said. The easing measures will take effect on 10 December and remain in force until 12 January. 4.35pm GMT UK reports 616 more Covid-linked deaths and 12,282 more cases The UK government said a further 616 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Tuesday, bringing the UK total to 62,033. As of 9am on Monday, there had been a further 12,282 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK.It brings the total number of cases in the UK to 1,750,241. Separate figures published by the UK’s statistics agencies for deaths where Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate, together with additional data on deaths that have occurred in recent days, show there have now been 78,000 deaths involving Covid-19 in the UK. Updated at 4.38pm GMT 4.31pm GMT A European Union delegation visited Gaza on Tuesday pledging to help the blockaded Palestinian enclave access coronavirus vaccines, as the epidemic there continues to escalate. EU representative to the Palestinian Territories Sven Kuhn von Burgsdorff, who led the delegation of roughly 20 people, said the bloc would work with the United Nations “to facilitate (vaccination) to those most in need.” “It’s a very complicated issue, but... the moment these vaccines become available, we will try our utmost,” he said. Gaza, ruled by the Islamist group Hamas since 2007, is under a tight Israeli-enforced blockade, one factor that has led to weak health infrastructure in the Palestinian enclave. Israel says the blockade is necessary to contain Hamas. Hamas acted fast in March to forestall the virus, only allowing entry to a limited number of people, who were then required to isolate for three weeks in quarantine centres.

Photograph: Said Khatib/AFP/Getty Images In mid-August, Gaza had recorded only around 100 Covid-19 cases, but the past two weeks have seen a rapid deterioration in containment. On Monday, Hamas said it had received 20,000 test kits from the World Health Organization, after warning it could no longer perform testing due to a shortage. Facing a surge in cases, Hamas has also announced a lockdown on weekends lasting from December 11 to the end of the month. It also closed schools, universities, kindergartens and mosques. Gaza has now registered nearly 25,600 coronavirus infections, including around 150 deaths. Israel’s government has meanwhile announced the procurement of millions of doses of vaccines from both Pfizer and Moderna, but has not yet commented on whether its procurement would cater for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank or Gaza. Updated at 4.52pm GMT 4.27pm GMT Pfizer chief executive Albert Bourla said he understood concerns around the speed at which pharmaceutical companies have produced Covid-19 vaccines, but insisted that no corners had been cut. As Britain became the first Western country to start a mass coronavirus vaccine campaign, using the new Pfizer-BioNTech jab, Bourla said people should feel confident that it is safe and effective. “We didn’t cut any corners,” he told a virtual media briefing hosted by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA). The vaccine, based on new technology, has been tested “in the exact same way as we are testing any vaccine that is circulating out there,” Bourla assured. In fact, he added, “this vaccine actually was tested, because of the scrutiny, with even higher standards in terms of how we do things.” Care home worker Pillay Jagambrun, 61, receives a dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine at Croydon University Hospital in south London. Photograph: Dan Charity/AFP/Getty Images The Pfizer-BioNTech jab is one of several vaccine candidates approaching approval in a number of countries, bringing hope for an end to the pandemic that has killed more than 1.5 million people worldwide and ravaged economies. Bourla said he understood the concerns around the speed at which the vaccines had been developed. “Always there are people who are sceptical about vaccines, but I have to say they are wrong,” he said. “I can imagine that in this case, because the products, the vaccines or the medicines are developed very fast that it is even worse because it has been severely politicised, particularly in the US. “That makes people confused. They don’t know who to believe and what to believe, because the discussion was happening on political rather than on scientific terms.” 4.08pm GMT Russia’s second city Saint Petersburg registered a record number of virus deaths as authorities warned of an imminent lockdown and shuttered restaurants for the New Year’s holidays. Saint Petersburg - one of Russia’s most popular tourist destinations - is struggling with a major health crisis, with hospitals overwhelmed with coronavirus patients but residents flouting social distancing and other measures. Saint Petersburg, Russia’s worst-hit city after Moscow, recorded 3,734 new cases and 86 new coronavirus deaths, a record since the start of the pandemic. By comparison, Moscow, the outbreak’s epicentre, registered 5,232 new cases and 71 new fatalities. St Petersburg Governor Alexander Beglov Photograph: Alexander Demianchuk/TASS On Monday, Saint Petersburg Governor Alexander Beglov warned that the city was close to a formal lockdown as local hospitals were nearing full capacity. “A time has come for Saint Petersburg when very little separates us from a full lockdown,” Beglov said. He added that the approaching New Year’s holidays should not become a “marathon of spreading coronavirus”. Last week, Saint Petersburg authorities announced new virus restrictions, including the closure of bars and restaurants from December 30 until January 3. The decision prompted an outcry from local businesses with over 100 bars and restaurants announcing that they will not obey the orders in the absence of any tangible government support. Updated at 5.02pm GMT 2.36pm GMT Germany moving towards stricter measures Germany inched towards stricter measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus, as an eastern region said it would close schools and most businesses and the health minister warned a partial lockdown had not stopped the disease. Europe’s biggest economy is struggling to squash new infections in a second wave of Covid-19 that is both proving far more difficult to tame than the first one and extracting a heavier human toll as daily deaths hit record highs. The governor of the eastern state of Saxony, which has the highest seven-day incidence rate per 100,000 residents anywhere in Germany, said schools and non-essential businesses will be shut from 14 December as hospitals struggle to take in patients. Saxony governor, Michael Kretschmer, said: The situation in hospitals is not only tense, it is extremely dangerous at many locations, partly because a large number of beds are occupied by Covid-19 patients. German Health Minister Jens Spahn arrives with a face mask for a press statement in Berlin, Germany Photograph: Clemens Bilan/EPA The federal health minister, Jens Spahn, said existing measures such as closing gyms, restaurants, hotels and leisure venues, as well as limits on the number of people in shops and at private gatherings, were not enough to reverse the tide. He told the public broadcaster Phoenix: A short and comprehensive approach to really make a difference is probably more successful. If we don’t get there within the next one or two weeks until Christmas, we have to discuss it,” he added, referring to stricter measures that may well be similar to those approved in Saxony. Updated at 2.58pm GMT 2.20pm GMT Switzerland has increased its confirmed order for Moderna Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine doses to 7.5mfrom 4.5m, the US company said. The vaccine, mRNA-1273, is currently under review in the country, and Moderna said it could ship it as soon as regulatory approval is granted. The company has submitted applications seeking emergency use authorization in the United States and the European Union after full results from a late-stage study showed the vaccine was 94.1% effective with no serious safety concerns. Vaccine doses to be supplied to the country will be sourced from Moderna’s European production capacity with its partner Swiss contract drug manufacturer Lonza and Rovi of Spain for fill-finish services. Moderna, whose vaccine requires two doses per person, has said it remains on track to produce between 500 million and 1 billion doses annually by 2021. Updated at 2.43pm GMT 2.03pm GMT Japan’s government has approved more than $700 billion in fresh stimulus to fund projects from anti-coronavirus measures to green tech, the country’s third such package this financial year. The Covid-19 pandemic has wrought global economic carnage and countries across the world have announced massive cash injections.

It is the first stimulus spending, the prime minister Yoshihide Suga has announced since taking office in September, and comes as Japan faces a spike in Covid-19 infections, with record numbers of new cases reported in recent weeks. “We drew up (the stimulus package) to pave the way for new growth, to protect people’s livelihoods as well as maintaining employment and keeping businesses going,” Suga said. Updated at 2.15pm GMT 1.31pm GMT Dutch coronavirus cases rise for first week since October The number of new coronavirus cases in the Netherlands has resumed rising after falling for weeks, the country’s health authority has said. There were 43,103 new cases registered in the week ended 8 December, the National Institute for Health said in its weekly update, up from 33,949 in the week ended 1 December. Updated at 1.57pm GMT 1.05pm GMT A national train tour by Prince William and his wife, Kate, has received a frosty welcome from leaders in Wales and Scotland, with one Welsh official saying he would rather “no one was having unnecessary visits” during the coronavirus pandemic. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrived in the Welsh capital of Cardiff on Tuesday for the final day of their three-day royal train tour, meant to spread Christmas cheer and thank medical staff and other frontline employees for their hard, dangerous work during the pandemic. William and Kate attend a ‘toast your own marshmallow’ stall during a visit to Cardiff Castle in Cardiff in south Wales. Photograph: Jonathan Buckmaster/AFP/Getty Images But the Welsh health minister, Vaughan Gething, said he was not “particularly bothered or interested” when asked on BBC radio if he thought the couple should travel to Wales when the region has been recording high Covid-19 infections. Gething said on Monday that Wales was the only part of the UK where infections were not falling at the end of November, and warned that further restrictions might be needed. Asked if it was the right moment for the royal couple to visit, Gething said: I’d rather that no one was having unnecessary visits. And people always have divisive views about the monarchy, but their visit isn’t an excuse for people to say that they are confused about what they are being asked to do. On Monday, the Scottish leader, Nicola Sturgeon, suggested that William and Kate travelled to the Scottish capital of Edinburgh despite their office being made aware of coronavirus restrictions for those wanting to cross the border. Royal officials have said the visits were planned in consultation with the Scottish and Welsh governments, and that William and Kate were allowed to travel across the border because they were working. Wales and Scotland have their own devolved governments and different sets of coronavirus restrictions from England even though they are all part of the UK. Welsh and Scottish officials have discouraged people from the rest of the UK from travelling to their regions without a reasonable excuse in an attempt to reduce the virus’s spread. Britain has Europe’s deadliest outbreak, at more than 61,000 reported dead. Updated at 1.58pm GMT 12.44pm GMT Milan’s La Scala opera house staged a three-hour televised medley of arias and ballet on Monday after the coronavirus pandemic forced the cancellation of the traditional season opener for the first time since the second world war. Masked members of the choir and orchestra performed the national anthem in an empty auditorium that in other years would be packed with Italy’s political, business and show business elite for one of the highlights of Milan’s cultural calendar. La Scala premiere cancelled, Milan, Italy. Photograph: Nick Zonna/IPA/REX/Shutterstock Organisers called the show “A riveder le stelle” (“to see the stars again”) in reference to the final phrase in Dante Alighieri’s Inferno, signalling hope that the pandemic which has brought Europe’s economy to its knees will soon be overcome. The conductor, Riccardo Chailly, said: This was an extraordinary experience but I hope not to repeat it. Italy shut its theatres and concert halls in October to contain a resurgence of the pandemic after the summer and the restrictions are due to stay in place until at least after the Christmas holiday season. Some performances were live and others prerecorded. They included the star dancer Roberto Bolle, who performed a ballet solo surrounded only by light beams.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian Organisers also took viewers to normally off-limits rehearsal and backstage areas of La Scala, the 242-year-old theatre at the heart of Milan’s musical life. With the Lombardy region around Milan among the worst affected areas in Europe and still recording thousands of new coronavirus infections every day, it is still unclear how La Scala will stage its planned new season. In October dozens of La Scala singers and musicians tested positive for the virus, forcing all members of the chorus into quarantine along with members of the orchestra. Updated at 2.14pm GMT 12.28pm GMT Switzerland and Italy will halt all cross-border rail service from Thursday because train personnel do not have capacity to carry out Covid-19 safety checks ordered by the Italian government, the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) has said. The move, in place indefinitely, affects dozens of daily routes, including long-distance trains between Milan and Frankfurt, Germany, as well as regional trains that connect the two countries, where many workers travel daily across the border from northern Italy to Switzerland. Switzerland and neighbouring Italy, Germany and France had reduced train service in November, but rising cases during the second wave of infections that prompted the Italian government’s new requirements mean train service will be stopped much like it was during the pandemic’s first wave. Swiss railway Photograph: FedevPhoto/Alamy Stock Photo Italy did not explicitly forbid train travel abroad, but its requirements – including for passengers’ temperatures to be measured – exceed the capacity of train personnel, an SBB spokeswoman told Reuters, leading to the decision to shutter the Swiss-Italian routes. SBB said: Swiss Federal Railways trains will travel only to the country’s border to Italy. Italy, France and Germany have also introduced new requirements meant to prevent skiers from travelling over the holidays to Switzerland and Austria, where resorts are due to be open for limited, locals-only skiing. Updated at 12.31pm GMT 12.05pm GMT India’s government regulator could grant a license to some developers of Covid-19 vaccines in the next few weeks, the country’s top health official said on Tuesday. Six vaccines, including Astra Zeneca’s Covidshield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, are in trial stages, the federal health secretary, Rajesh Bhushan, said. Bhushan said Bharat Biotech had sought emergency-use authorisation from India’s drug regulator for its Covid-19 vaccine. Pfizer and Astra Zeneca have already applied for emergency-use authorisation in India. Updated at 12.22pm GMT 11.51am GMT This has just been sent in by a reader.

Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 12.23pm GMT 11.40am GMT Health officials and experts are still baffled by a mysterious illness that has left more than 500 people hospitalised and one person dead in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The illness was first detected Saturday evening in Eluru, an ancient city famous for its hand-woven products. People started convulsing without any warning, said Geeta Prasadini, the director of public health. Since then, symptoms ranging from nausea and anxiety to loss of consciousness have been reported in 546 patients admitted to hospitals. Many have recovered and returned home, while 148 are still being treated, said Dasari Nagarjuna, a government spokesperson. Teams of experts have arrived at the city from India’s top scientific institutes. Different theories have been suggested and are being tested. The most recent hypothesis is contamination of food by pesticides. “But nobody knows,” Prasadini admitted. Patients and their bystanders are seen at the district government hospital in Eluru, Andhra Pradesh state, India, Sunday, Dec.6 2020. Photograph: AP What is confounding experts is that there does not seem to be any common link among the hundreds of people who have fallen sick. All of the patients have tested negative for Covid-19 and other viral diseases such as dengue, chikungunya or herpes. They are not related to each other and do not all live in the same area. They’re from different age groups, including about 70 children, but very few are elderly. Initially, contaminated water was suspected. But the chief minister’s office confirmed that people who do not use the municipal water supply have also fallen ill, and that initial tests of water samples did not reveal any harmful chemicals. A 45-year-old man with the single name Sridhar was hospitalised with symptoms resembling epilepsy and died on Sunday evening, doctors said. Prasadini said his autopsy did not shed any light on the cause of death. The hypothesis currently being tested is that people ate vegetables tainted with pesticides made of organic compounds containing phosphorus. But this is an assumption based on the fact that such pesticides are commonly used in the area and not on any evidence, Prasadini said. She said that experts were testing to see if pesticides had contaminated fish ponds or spilled over to vegetables. Opposition leader N Chandrababu Naidu demanded on Twitter an “impartial, full-fledged inquiry into the incident.” Andhra Pradesh state is among those worst hit by Covid-19, with more than 800,000 detected cases. The health system in the state, like the rest of India, has been frayed by the virus. Updated at 11.49am GMT 11.27am GMT Israel will receive a first shipment of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccines on Thursday and will administer them to the elderly and other high-risk populations, a cabinet minister said on Tuesday. Pfizer and its partner BioNTech last month agreed to provide Israel with 8m doses of the vaccine, which Britain on Tuesday became the first country to administer. The intelligence minister, Eli Cohen, confirmed media reports that a first batch would be flown to Tel Aviv from Chicago on Thursday. Israel’s Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen. Photograph: Ronen Zvulun/Reuters Those doses would be given to at-risk populations, mainly those over 60-years-old, Cohen said in an interview with Army Radio. He gave no start date for the innoculations or details of the size of the batch. The public broadcaster Kan said it would contain 110,000 doses. Israel, with a population of 9 million, has reported 347,497 coronavirus cases and 2,925 deaths. 11.23am GMT Red wine mulled with cinnamon sticks, star aniseed, orange and plenty of sugar is a staple of the German Christmas season. And while cities across the country have this year agreed to forego hosting Christmas markets on their town squares due to the pandemic, Germans seem less willing to give up on the seasonal mug of steaming Glühwein. German authorities on Tuesday expressed their growing concern about pop-up stalls selling mulled wine in takeaway cups and “Glühwein street-walkers” gathering in city centres in spite of social distancing restrictions. A Christmas booth sells mulled wine to go in front of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church at the Breitscheidplatz in Berlin, Germany. Photograph: Hayoung Jeon/EPA The health minister, Jens Spahn, told the broadcaster RTL it was irresponsible to have crowds of people congregating around pop-up stalls while hospitals around Germany were voicing concerns about rising infections. Health expert Karl Lauterbach, of the Social Democratic party (SPD) complained that ’mulled wine booths are undermining social distancing restrictions’. There would be plenty of time to indulge in the sweetly sick drink after people had been vaccinated, he said. Some cities, including Lüneburg, Leipzig and Hamburg, have already taken steps to sell the outdoor sale of alcoholic beverages. Updated at 11.28am GMT 11.10am GMT Four lions at Barcelona zoo have tested positive for Covid-19, veterinary authorities said on Tuesday, in only the second known case in which large felines have contracted coronavirus. Three females – named Zala, Nima and Run Run – and Kiumbe, a male, were tested after keepers noticed they showed slight symptoms of coronavirus. Two staff at the zoo also tested positive for coronavirus, the authorities said, after the outbreak was first detected last month. Authorities are investigating how the lions became infected. Keepers carried out PCR tests on the lions in the same way as humans are tested as the animals are accustomed to contact with the zoo staff. The veterinary service of Barcelona contacted colleagues at the Bronx Zoo in New York, where four tigers and three lions tested positive for Covid-19 in April. It is the only other zoo where large felines are known to have contracted coronavirus. All of them recovered. “The zoo has contacted and collaborated with international experts such as the veterinary service of the Bronx zoo, the only one that has documented cases of Sars-CoV-2 infection in felines,” the Barcelona zoo said in a statement. The lions were given veterinary care for their mild clinical condition – similar to a very mild flu condition – through anti-inflammatory treatment and close monitoring, and the animals responded well. The four-year-old male and the females, who are all 16 years old, have had no contact with other animals at the zoo, which is open to visitors.

Reuters reports: The health minister, Jens Spahn, told the public broadcaster Phoenix: A short and comprehensive approach to really make a difference is probably more successful. If we don’t get there within the next one or two weeks until Christmas, we have to discuss it. Spahn did not rule out lockdown measures that would affect retailers, the TV station added. Germany introduced a partial lockdown in early November and banned in-door dining in restaurants. Shops and schools remain open. Political leaders believe the restrictions prevented further exponential growth of new infections, but numbers have plateaued. Germany reported 487 deaths on a single day last week, the highest number since the start of the pandemic. Updated at 11.07am GMT 10.49am GMT Denmark is reinstating tighter restrictions on 38 towns and cities including Copenhagen and Aarhus.

The restrictions will stay in place until 2021.https://t.co/rIYVmMsgT8 — The Local Denmark (@TheLocalDenmark) December 7, 2020 From today restaurants, bars, cafes, gyms, sports centres and swimming pools will be closed in the restricted areas. 10.10am GMT In Italy Pope Francis has made an unannounced, pre-dawn visit to a Rome landmark to pray after he was forced to cancel the traditional public ceremony because Covid-19. From Reuters: Popes traditionally go to Rome’s Spanish Steps area on the afternoon of 8 December, the Roman Catholic feast of the Immaculate Conception, to place a wreath of flowers at the base of a 12-metre column bearing a statue of the Madonna. The event, usually attended by thousands of people lining the streets and considered the start of the Rome Christmas season, was cancelled this year to avoid gatherings that could cause contagion. Francis went at 7am and placed a basket of white roses at the base of the statue in the rain. During the 15-minute visit he prayed for the city and for all people around the world affected by Covid-19, a Vatican statement said. Television footage showed the pope wearing a white mask and holding his own umbrella as he prayed. He then went to the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, where he said Mass before returning to the Vatican. It was the first of a series of Christmas season papal events being curtailed because of the pandemic. Only a limited number of people will be allowed into St Peter’s Basilica for papal Christmas Eve and Christmas Day Masses, which will be broadcast on television and streamed online. Access to his “Urbi et Orbi” (“To the city and the world”) blessing and message will also be restricted. In October, the pope’s weekly general audiences were moved back indoors without public participation after a period when a limited number of people were allowed to take part. Italy has had 60,606 Covid fatalities since its outbreak emerged in February, the second highest toll in Europe after Britain. It has registered 1.74 million cases to date. Updated at 11.09am GMT 9.41am GMT Poland has bought over 60m doses of Covid-19 vaccines from six producers, the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said. He wrote in a Facebook post: We are secured – and now is the time for a great challenge, which is the implementation of the National Covid-19 vaccination programme. Updated at 10.02am GMT 9.29am GMT The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, said people should not be afraid of getting vaccinated, and that people objecting to having the jab are “totally wrong”. Speaking at the vaccination centre at Guy’s hospital in London on Tuesday, he said: To all those who are scared [of getting vaccinated] – don’t be [...] You have seen people take the vaccine this morning in large numbers. There’s nothing to be nervous about. What I would say is that there are those obviously who feel that a vaccine is something they object to politically or for ideological reasons. I think they are totally wrong. It’s safe, it’s the right thing to do, it’s good for you and it’s good for the whole country. It’s going to take a while. I urge people to contain their impatience. Johnson said it was “very, very exciting” to meet some of the first people to be vaccinated against coronavirus. The prime minister said it was moving to talk to Lyn Wheeler, who was the first to receive the vaccine at Guy’s hospital. She is 81 and it is really very moving to hear her say she is doing it for Britain, which is exactly right – she is protecting herself but also helping to protect the entire country. Johnson warned that it would take time to vaccinate everyone: It will gradually make a huge, huge difference, but I stress ‘gradually’ because we are not there yet, we have not defeated this virus yet. We can’t afford to relax now and so my message would be: it’s amazing to see the vaccine coming out. Updated at 10.04am GMT 8.45am GMT Indonesia’s state-owned pharmaceutical company Bio Farma has said that interim data on trials it was conducting on vaccines produced by the Chinese company Sinovac showed up to 97% efficacy. From Reuters: Iwan Setiawan, a spokesman for Bio Farma, said it did not provide data on how many participants got infected during the trial that involved 1,600 people. He said: Our clinical trial team found, within one month, that the interim data shows up to 97% for its efficacy. Iwan said Bio Farma would wait for full results and it expected Indonesia’s food and drug agency to issue emergency use authorisation in late January before mass vaccination could start.

Dining out will be banned after 6 pm, beauty and massage parlours will be forced to close, and civil servants would be asked to work from home, she said. Hong Kong’s strict social distancing measures have largely helped keep infections to under 7,000 in the city of 7.5 million, with 112 deaths. But daily recorded cases have risen again to more than 100 on several occasions in recent weeks, the highest level since July. Speaking ahead of a weekly meeting with policy advisers, Lam said “the strictness of social distancing measures must at least return to the level” of the outbreak’s peak in the city in July and August.

Today the first vaccinations in the UK against COVID-19 begin. Thank you to our NHS, to all of the scientists who worked so hard to develop this vaccine, to all the volunteers - and to everyone who has been following the rules to protect others. We will beat this together. https://t.co/poOYG1vHQe — Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) December 8, 2020 7.46am GMT The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has told BBC Good Morning Scotland the next doses of the vaccine will arrive next week. He said: The next scheduled arrival will be next week and the numbers depend on how quickly Pfizer can manufacture it. It is being manufactured in Belgium and obviously right across the UK. The job is to be able to get the vaccinations done as quickly as the manufacturer can create it, so we’ve been all working together really closely, the UK government, which has been buying the vaccine and getting it delivered into the country, and then the NHS in the four nations of the UK. Asked how quickly the vaccine can arrive and in what sort of numbers, he replied: We’ve got a broad schedule, there will be several million for the UK as a whole, so several hundred thousand for Scotland over the remainder of this month. We’ve got that as a broad delivery schedule but obviously the manufacturing process itself is complicated, so we’ve got to get the stuff in the country and then once it’s in the country we can be confident that we’re able to deliver it, and I’m sure the NHS across Scotland and across the whole of the UK is up to the challenge. Hancock told Sky News he hoped care home residents would start being vaccinated before Christmas, but he could only do that “as fast as is safe”. Hancock also said vaccine cards being issued to patients were “standard NHS reminder cards” for the follow-up appointment for the second dose, adding: We are not proposing to have a sort of immunity certificate that allows you to do different things. The first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, said she “got a lump in her throat” watching a video of the first Covid-19 vaccination being administered. Got a bit of a lump in the throat watching this. Feels like such a milestone moment after a tough year for everyone. The first vaccines in Scotland will be administered today too. https://t.co/KKaEhf19Jo — Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) December 8, 2020 Updated at 10.09am GMT 7.31am GMT NHS nurse Mrs Parsons said it was a “huge honour” to be the first in the country to deliver the vaccine to a patient. She said: It’s a huge honour to be the first person in the country to deliver a Covid-19 jab to a patient, I’m just glad that I’m able to play a part in this historic day. The last few months have been tough for all of us working in the NHS, but now it feels like there is light at the end of the tunnel. The NHS Covid-19 vaccination programme will see patients aged 80 and above who are already attending hospital as an outpatient, and those who are being discharged home after a hospital stay, among the first to receive the jab. Care home providers are also being asked by the Department of Health and Social Care to begin booking staff in to vaccination clinics. GPs are also expected to be able to begin vaccinating care home residents. Any appointments not used for these groups will be used for healthcare workers who are at highest risk of serious illness from Covid-19. 7.26am GMT The chief executive of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens, praised all those involved in delivering the new vaccine programme. He said: Less than a year after the first case of this new disease was diagnosed, the NHS has now delivered the first clinically approved Covid-19 vaccination – that is a remarkable achievement. A heartfelt thank you goes to everyone who has made this a reality – the scientists and doctors who worked tirelessly, and the volunteers who selflessly took part in the trials. They have achieved in months what normally takes years. My colleagues across the health service are rightly proud of this historic moment as we lead in deploying the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

The retired jewellery shop assistant, who was given the jab by nurse May Parsons at her local hospital, added: I can’t thank May and the NHS staff enough who have looked after me tremendously, and my advice to anyone offered the vaccine is to take it – if I can have it at 90 then you can have it too. Keenan said she has been self-isolating for most of this year and was planning on having a very small family “bubble” Christmas to keep safe. Originally from Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, she has lived in Coventry for more than 60 years. She will receive a booster jab in 21 days to ensure she has the best chance of being protected against the virus. Updated at 10.11am GMT 7.04am GMT That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today.

Hong Kong to impose new virus restrictions. Hong Kong will ban evening dining at restaurants and close fitness centres, the city’s leader said Tuesday, as part of new measures aimed at stemming a fourth wave of coronavirus infections. Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the rules aim to reduce the “number of people on the streets”, echoing moves taken by authorities when cases spiked earlier this year. The World Health Organization said on Monday that persuading people on the merits of a Covid-19 vaccine would be far more effective than trying to make the jabs mandatory. The WHO said it would be down to individual countries as to how they want to conduct their vaccination campaigns against the coronavirus pandemic. South Korea ordered vaccines for 44 million people. According to Yonhap, South Korea has secured 64m doses for 44 million people (three of the vaccines need two shots). Vaccines for 34 million will come directly from the drugmakers and 10 million via the WHO. The vaccines ordered are sufficient to cover 88% of the population. The US president, Donald Trump, will sign an executive order on Tuesday to ensure that priority access for Covid-19 vaccines is given to the American people for doses procured by the US government, before assisting other nations, senior administration officials said on Monday. Armed police raid home of Florida scientist fired over Covid-19 data.

India reports lowest daily rise in coronavirus cases since 10 July. India reported 26,567 new coronavirus infections, data from the health ministry showed on Tuesday, the lowest daily increase since 10 July. Daily cases have been falling in India since hitting a peak in September. The country has 9.7m cases, second-highest caseload in the world after the United States.

Updated at 10.16am GMT 6.32am GMT Indian authorities are investigating if organochlorines used as pesticides or in mosquito control caused the death of one person and hospitalisation of more than 400 in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh in the past few days, a health official said on Tuesday, Reuters reports. The unknown illness has infected more than 300 children, with most of them suffering from dizziness, fainting spells, headache and vomiting. They have tested negative for Covid-19. The federal lawmaker GVL Narasimha Rao, who is from the state, said on Twitter he had spoken with government medical experts and that the “most likely cause is poisonous organochlorine substances”. “It is one of the possibilities,” said Geeta Prasadini, a public health director in Andhra Pradesh state, adding they were awaiting test reports to ascertain the cause.

Organochlorines are banned or restricted in many countries after research linked them to cancer and other potential health risks. However, some of the pollutants remain in the environment for years and build up in animal and human body fat. It was not immediately clear how extensively the chemicals are used in India, though it is found in DDT applied for mosquito control. Exposure to organochlorine pesticides over a short period may produce convulsions, headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, tremors, confusion, muscle weakness, slurred speech, salivation and sweating, US health authorities say.

The reported death toll rose by 423 to 19,342, the tally showed. 5.57am GMT A surge in Covid-19 infections and the prospect of another economic downturn could sorely test the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s reluctant acceptance of much higher interest rates and the need for greater austerity, Reuters reports. Already, record Covid-19 infections and deaths have led to new curfews and shorter business hours, hitting Turkey’s large hospitality sector and many others struggling with double-digit inflation, and raising fears of a winter recession. Erdoğan is also facing serious geopolitical headwinds, with the European Union and the United States both weighing economic sanctions, respectively over a gas drilling dispute and Turkey’s purchase of Russian missile defences. “It remains to be seen if the government will really stick to the recent tightening in economic policy if growth decelerates markedly,” said Yesenn El-Radhi, senior sovereign analyst at Capital Intelligence Ratings.

Photograph: Ümit Bektaş/Reuters Last month, Erdoğan’s newly installed central bank governor jacked up the policy rate by 475 points to 15%, cheering foreign investors. The currency rallied but more tightening is expected, given the Turkish lira is still down 24% this year versus the dollar. The new finance minister, Lütfi Elvan, has promised fiscal policies that support macroeconomic and price stability. The government has aggressively reined in credit growth to below 10% from 50% in the summer. A burst of state-driven cheap credit had triggered a sharp rebound in the third quarter but the pivot towards what Erdogan calls a new economic era with “bitter pills” could now lead to a technical recession on a sequential basis through the first quarter of 2021.

Reuters: Normally, about 30 employees at the Lien Teng Enterprise factory in Taichung, central Taiwan, would be making more than 10,000 trees. But this year, clients have slashed orders in anticipation of a huge slide in demand because of the coronavirus pandemic, and the factory has had to cut back staff to fewer than 10. “We have lost half or more of our exports to Europe and the Americas,” said Tsai, known in Taiwan as the “Christmas King”.

While few Taiwanese celebrate Christmas, the firm supplies decorations to shopping malls and major landmarks. With the island relatively unscathed by the virus, Tsai said demand had been quite stable. At a wholesale shop selling products from Lien Teng Enterprise last week, a steady stream of customers perused the offerings of festive baubles and fake pines in every imaginable hue. “We cannot travel overseas, so we came here today to check out if there are wholesale products in Taiwan,” said Wu Ming Teng, a Christmas product retailer. Updated at 10.23am GMT 4.38am GMT India reports lowest daily rise in coronavirus cases since 10 July India reported 26,567 new coronavirus infections, data from the health ministry showed on Tuesday, the lowest daily increase since July 10, according to a Reuters tally. Daily cases have been falling in India since hitting a peak in September. The country has 9.7 million cases, second-highest caseload in the world after the United States. Deaths rose by 385, the health ministry said, with the total now at 140,958. 4.23am GMT Hong Kong to impose new virus restrictions Hong Kong will ban evening dining at restaurants and close fitness centres, the city’s leader said Tuesday, as part of new measures aimed at stemming a fourth wave of coronavirus infections, AFP reports. Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the rules aim to reduce the “number of people on the streets”, echoing moves taken by authorities when cases spiked earlier this year. Dining out will be banned after 6pm, beauty and massage parlours will be forced to close, and civil servants would be asked to work from home, she said. Hong Kong’s strict social distancing measures have largely helped keep infections to under 7,000 in the city of 7.5 million, with 112 deaths. But daily recorded cases have risen again to more than 100 on several occasions in recent weeks, the highest level since July. Cleaners sterilise the street in Hong Kong, China, 3 December 2020. Photograph: Top Photo Corporation/REX/Shutterstock Speaking ahead of a weekly meeting with policy advisers, Lam said “the strictness of social distancing measures must at least return to the level” of the outbreak’s peak in the city in July and August. Schools, bars and nightclubs have already been ordered to close. Lam did not say when the measures would come into effect, but added that the city’s health minister, Sophia Chan, would announce further details later on Tuesday. Last week Hong Kong reimposed social distancing measures at some of their strictest levels since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Restrictions on public gatherings were tightened with a maximum of two people allowed to meet, down from four. Authorities have also launched a hotline for residents to report social distancing breaches.

The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on 12 November, was widely shared on social media including by scientists, doctors and policymakers and was covered in dozens of news stories. The researchers calculated the years of life lost that might be attributable to school closures, and compared that to the years of life lost attributed to the first months of the pandemic: Related: Coronavirus study that found US school closures cut life expectancy criticised by epidemiologist 3.53am GMT Armed police raid home of Florida scientist fired over Covid-19 data Rebekah Jones, the Florida data scientist embroiled in a dispute with the state’s Republican governor over the handling of coronavirus figures, had her home raided on Monday by armed police who confiscated her computers. In a stream of posts on Twitter, Jones posted a video of the raid that showed state police carrying handguns escorting her out of her Tallahassee home. She can be heard saying: “He just pointed a gun at my children,” with her husband and two children apparently upstairs at the time. Jones claimed in her tweets that the raid was the work of Ron DeSantis, the governor with whom she has clashed repeatedly since she was fired by the state’s department of health in May in a row over Covid-19 data. She compared the incident to sending “the gestapo”, adding: “This is what happens to scientists who do their job honestly. This is what happens to people who speak truth to power.” The Florida department of law enforcement confirmed they had entered Jones’s house on a search warrant. But in a statement the department said the action was related to a recent computer hack of the health department website, in which emergency response coordinators were sent an unauthorised message: Related: Armed police raid home of Florida scientist fired over Covid-19 data 3.35am GMT Here is our story on the Trump administration passing up a chance last summer to buy millions of additional doses of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine, a decision that could delay the delivery of a second batch of doses until the manufacturer fulfils other international contracts. The revelation, first reported by the New York Times and confirmed to the Associated Press on Monday, came a day before Donald Trump aimed to take credit for the speedy development of forthcoming vaccines at a White House summit. Pfizer’s vaccine, one of the leading Covid-19 vaccine contenders, is expected to be approved by a panel of Food and Drug Administration scientists as soon as this week, with delivery of 100m doses – enough for 50 million Americans – expected in coming months: Related: Trump administration refused offer to buy millions more Pfizer vaccine doses 3.29am GMT Hello!

The Trump administration is confident it will have enough vaccine to inoculate everyone who wants a vaccine by the end of the second quarter of 2021, one official said, disputing a New York Times story that the government declined when Pfizer Inc offered in late summer to sell more vaccine doses to the United States. Trump, who has faced sharp criticism for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, is eager to take credit for the speedy development and distribution of a vaccine. One official said the executive order would lead to the formulation of guidelines for US government agencies to help other countries procure the vaccine once demand in the United States was met. It was unclear why an executive order was needed to ensure that the vaccines would be distributed domestically first, though the order appeared to be designed in part to underscore Trump’s “America First” philosophy ahead of the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden. US President Donald Trump Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images The White House is holding a summit on Tuesday to explain plans for vaccine distribution through Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, which has been organising the effort.

South Korea reported 594 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday as the government prepared to outline its plans to secure enough vaccine candidates to potentially vaccinate millions of people next year. The elderly, frontline healthcare workers and first responders will be the first vaccinated. According to Yonhap, South Korea has secured 64 million doses for 44 million people (three of the vaccines need two shots). Vaccines for 34 million will come directly from the drugmakers and 10 million via the WHO. The vaccines ordered are sufficient to cover 88% of the population. Unlike South Korea’s previous two waves of infections, which were largely focused around a handful of facilities or events, the new wave is being driven by smaller, harder-to-trace clusters in and around the densely populated capital city of Seoul. A Covid-19 test being taken in Seoul. Photograph: Jeon Heon-Kyun/EPA Vice health minister Kang Do-tae said the government had been unable to trace the origin of 26% of all cases, and the positivity rate spiked nearly fourfold within a month to about 4%. “If social distancing is not implemented properly, outbreaks in the greater Seoul area would lead to greater transmissions nationwide,” Kang told a meeting of health officials according to a transcript from the health ministry. South Korean President Moon Jae-in called on Monday for expanded coronavirus testing and more thorough tracing as infections continued to rise despite the imposition of increasingly restrictive social distancing measures. Health authorities predicted daily cases would hover between 550 and 750 this week, and possibly spike to as much as 900 next week. If such predictions are accurate, Kang said the country’s health system may collapse. “There could be a dangerous situation where it becomes difficult not only to treat Covid-19 patients but also to provide essential medical services,” he said. South Korea has now reported a total of 38,755 cases, with 552 deaths. Updated at 3.40am GMT 1.29am GMT China reported 12 new Covid-19 cases on 7 December, down from 15 cases a day earlier, the national health authority said on Tuesday. The National Health Commission said in a statement 10 of the new cases were imported infections originating from overseas. The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, fell to five from six cases a day earlier. The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 86,646, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634. 1.17am GMT Mexico’s health ministry on Monday reported 6,399 new cases of coronavirus infection and an additional 357 fatalities, bringing the country’s totals to 1,182,249 cases and 110,074 deaths.

AFP: Tedros said health workers at high risk of infection were a top priority, plus people at the highest risk of serious disease or death due to their age - thereby easing the pressure on health systems. He said they should later be followed by people with a higher risk of severe disease due to underlying conditions, and marginalised groups at higher risk. The WHO’s ACT-Accelerator mechanism, pooling risk and reward among countries rich and poor, is a global attempt to speed up the development of Covid-19 vaccines, tests and treatments, and purchase and distribute them evenly regardless of wealth. However, the scheme needs $4.3 billion urgently, with a further $23.9 billion required in 2021. “What we need now globally is not to enter the land of empty promises in terms of supporting the ACT-Accelerator,” said Ryan, urging wealthy donors to stump up. “The means to do this allocation fairly and equitably is there. But what’s not in place is the financing to make that happen in 2021. “There’s too much of a gap between the rhetoric and the reality.” 11.46pm GMT WHO against mandatory Covid-19 vaccines The World Health Organization said Monday that persuading people on the merits of a Covid-19 vaccine would be far more effective than trying to make the jabs mandatory, AFP reports. The WHO said it would be down to individual countries as to how they want to conduct their vaccination campaigns against the coronavirus pandemic. But the UN health agency insisted making it mandatory to get immunised against the disease would be the wrong road to take, adding there were examples in the past of mandating vaccines use only to see it backfire with greater opposition to them. “I don’t think that mandates are the direction to go in here, especially for these vaccines,” Kate O’Brien, director of the WHO’s immunisation department, told a virtual news conference. “It is a much better position to actually encourage and facilitate the vaccination without those kinds of requirements. “I don’t think we envision any countries creating a mandate for vaccination.” O’Brien said there may be certain hospital professions in which being vaccinated might be required or highly recommended for staff and patient safety. But WHO experts admitted there was a battle to be fought to convince the general public to take the vaccines as they become available. 11.24pm GMT Summary Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest updates from around the world. You can find me on Twitter @helenrsullivan to ask me what I would like for Christmas. Britain is set to administer the first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Tuesday, with the NHS giving top priority to people over the age of 80, frontline healthcare workers and care home staff and residents. Meanwhile theWorld Health Organization said Monday that persuading people on the merits of a Covid-19 vaccine would be far more effective than trying to make the jabs mandatory. The WHO said it would be down to individual countries as to how they want to conduct their vaccination campaigns against the coronavirus pandemic. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: France unlikely to end lockdown as planned on 15 December. The French health ministry’s top official, Jérôme Salomon, has backed up the bleak assessment attributed to the health minister, Olivier Véran, earlier, who said the country was unlikely to meet the conditions required for ending its national lockdown on 15 December. Donald Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who tested positive for Covid-19, is doing well in the hospital and does not have a fever, the US president said. “Rudy’s doing well,” Trump told reporters. “No temperature, and he actually called me earlier this morning.” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada will get up to 249,000 doses of the vaccine developed by American drugmaker Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech before the end of December. Italy’s interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, discovered during a cabinet meeting on Monday that she had coronavirus, prompting her to leave the gathering hastily. political sources told Reuters. Citing a source in her office, the news agency reported that Lamorgese was asymptomatic and tested positive after undergoing a routine swab before the meeting. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said the government will offer Covid-19 vaccines to all Brazilians, without cost or obligation, once health regulator Anvisa gives it scientific and legal approval.In a post on his Twitter account, Bolsonaro also said the economy ministry has pledged there will be no shortage of resources for everyone who wants a vaccine to get one.","Id":"world/live/2020/dec/08/coronavirus-live-news-uk-to-start-vaccinations-on-tuesday-who-criticises-mandatory-vaccines","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Coronavirus live news: Brazil records highest daily death toll in a month; Briton first to receive vaccine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/dec/08/coronavirus-live-news-uk-to-start-vaccinations-on-tuesday-who-criticises-mandatory-vaccines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2020/dec/08/coronavirus-live-news-uk-to-start-vaccinations-on-tuesday-who-criticises-mandatory-vaccines","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":12160,"webPublicationDate":"2020-12-09T00:13:12Z","id":"world/live/2020/dec/08/coronavirus-live-news-uk-to-start-vaccinations-on-tuesday-who-criticises-mandatory-vaccines","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"A local’s guide to Rome: 10 top tips","body":"‘How do you cope with the tourists?” is a question that you get used to when living in Rome. But the truth is, for most of my time there, I hardly saw them. My first apartment was a stone’s throw from the Vatican, which meant that the local shops all sold rosary beads and holy water rather than bread and milk. But after learning that lesson, I quickly abandoned the centre in favour of the city’s more lively, and liveable, neighbourhoods. Related: 10 of the best restaurants near Rome’s major attractions In that sense, I’ve always seen Rome as two places. One is a spectacle that millions visit every year, with its monuments and crowds and cobbled streets, and the other is a city where the paint is peeling and the bins overflow, but also where you’ll find the best restaurants, the only bars worth drinking in and crucially, all but the richest of Romans. The Colosseum is a wonder; and, even after walking past a Bernini fountain a thousand times, it still leaves me speechless. But they’re only a small part of this incredible city’s identity. Contemporary romanità, to borrow a word from Italian, is to be found in the messy, modern sprawl to the fringes of the famous sites, and the contrast to be found there is the perfect antidote to downtown’s mire of guided groups, selfie sticks, and gladiators clad in plastic armour. L’Oasi della Birra This bar has one of the best beer selections in the city but, as it’s part of a wine shop, there are also plenty of options for those who prefer the grape to the grain. The bar has seating outside facing a lively piazza but most regulars sit indoors because they mainly come for the aperitivo buffet, which is enormous. All too often in Italy, these consist of limp pasta in lifeless sauces or various forms of flavourless bread, with a focus on quantity rather than quality, but at L’Oasi della Birra there’s a plethora of tasty snacks on offer, from fresh buffalo mozzarella and other cheeses to cured meats and baked dishes. • Piazza Testaccio 38-41, Mon–Sat 8am-1am, Sun 6pm-1am, on Facebook Mattatoio di Roma Formerly an annex of Rome’s museum of contemporary art, Macro Testaccio, the Mattatoio di Roma is a large complex of refurbished buildings that was once Testaccio’s slaughterhouse. It offers a refreshingly contemporary alternative to the more obvious and ancient attractions that most people associate with the city. In keeping with the neighbourhood’s reputation for nightlife, it’s occasionally open until midnight when there’s a show on, so it’s a good way to squeeze in a little bit more culture. Exhibitions change regularly but the building alone is worth a visit and still boasts many of its original features, including animal pens and a system of meat hooks on overhead rails. Next door, La Città dell’Altra Economia regularly runs cultural events of its own, usually focused on sustainability and ecology, and is a good spot to grab a bite to eat or a drink. • Piazza Orazio Giustiniani 4, opening hours vary, mattatoioroma.it Al Ristoro degli Angeli Garbatella is a leafy residential area just south of Ostiense, one of the city’s main stations. It’s popular with Romans for its distinctive architectural style, and for the abundant selection of places to eat among its warren of narrow streets (often made narrower by the local penchant for laissez-faire parking). Under an archway, just off a hectic piazza and across the road from the Teatro Palladium, Al Ristoro degli Angeli is, for me, the perfect neighbourhood restaurant. It’s in an old Ente Comunale di Consumo (Municipal Consumer Body), a kind of state-run shop created in the 1940s and 50s to serve working-class areas and limit inflation, and the decor is a mix of mid-20th century furniture and curiosities, ranging from an antique pizza transporter to theatre memorabilia and a collection of Star Wars toys. The ever-present owners are a treat and the staff are always friendly, it has a lively atmosphere and is cosy and informal, but the quality of the food and the small but excellent selection of wine lends the experience a sense of occasion. The menu is a celebration of Roman classics, sometimes with the proprietor’s personal twist. That’s not something that’s done lightly in these parts, where recipes for regional staples are treated more as canon than guidelines, and changes usually result in heated debate. But here, the touch is light and in the case of the cacio e pepe, a rich pasta dish made with pecorino cheese and black pepper, the addition of a wafer made from melted cheese is a welcome flourish rather than a violation of tradition. • Via Luigi Orlando 2, open for dinner only, closed Sunday, ristorodegliangeli.it Casetta Rossa Casetta Rossa is part social centre, part restaurant, run by a group of activists from a small, single-storey red building – from which it gets its name – in a spacious garden covered by thick canopy of trees beside the Parco Cavallo Pazzo. It runs a wide range of cultural events, and is a popular destination for locals on summer evenings, when dining outside is as much a necessity as a pleasure. Expect an uncomplicated menu that changes seasonally and is based on local, fresh produce. Booking is strongly advised. • Via Giovanni Battista Magnaghi 14, closed Monday, Sunday lunch only, casettarossa.org Ecosolidale market Held at weekends in old industrial sheds just off the hectic via Ostiense, this vintage market is a treasure trove of Italian fashion. Unlike with a lot of secondhand shops, there’s very little tat on display, and while the old ball gowns may not be to everyone’s taste, you’re likely to trip over a pre-loved Fendi bag or two as you dash to that rack of uber-cool 1970s coats. And best of all, proceeds go to charity. • Via del Porto Fluviale 2, Saturday 5pm–7pm, Sun 4.30pm–8pm, on Facebook Cimitero Acattolico Rome’s non-Catholic cemetery has some illustrious residents, from Antonio Gramsci, one of the founding fathers of European communism, to Belinda Lee, a now almost forgotten English actress who was a huge film star in the 1950s. Most visitors come to see the poets John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley but there’s a wide selection of fascinating lives to ponder, including an African-American anti-slavery activist and an atomic physicist. The most impressive of all the cemetery’s memorials is known as the Angel of Grief and is the work of William Wetmore Story, an American sculptor who made the statue for his wife. • Via Caio Cestio 6, Monday-Saturday 9am-5pm, Sunday and public holidays 9am-1pm, cemeteryrome.it Trattoria Zampagna A visit to the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls is a good way to take in some papal splendour without the crowds or the queues of the Vatican. Constructed on the site where Saint Paul is said to have been buried following his decapitation, it’s the second-largest church in the city after Saint Peter’s. Parts of it were built by the emperor Constantine in the fourth century, though most of the current building dates from the mid-1800s, after a fire destroyed much of the building. Many of the internal treasures were saved and the result is a rich mix of contrasting styles that conveys the basilica’s long history. Across the road, the kitchen at Trattoria Zampagna does much the same for the city’s culinary history. It’s the ideal place for a lazy lunch, with a reasonably priced menu full of old Roman reliables, served in large portions with a minimum of fuss. The carbonara and the bucatini all’amatriciana never fail to impress, and when in season the artichokes are a must. If a second course is in order, the coda alla vaccinara, slow-cooked oxtail with tomatoes and a large amount of celery, is about as Roman as it gets. According to local tradition, certain days bring special dishes, so expect handmade gnocchi on Thursdays, baccalà (salt cod) on Fridays and Roman-style tripe on Saturdays. • Via Ostiense 179, on Facebook, closed Sundays Flavio al Velavevodetto The Quinto Quarto (Fifth Quarter) refers to offal, with which butchers were traditionally part paid for the animals they slaughtered. As a result, the cheap cuts play a huge role in Roman cooking. And Testaccio, just south across the Tiber from touristy Trastevere, is the spiritual home for such dishes: it used to be the city’s main meat processing district. The area has been at the heart of trade in Rome since ancient times, and the main hill around which it grew up, Monte Testaccio, is actually a spoil heap of broken amphorae – ceramic containers used to transport goods – from the time of Emperor Augustus onwards. Flavio al Velavevodetto, one of Testaccio’s best restaurants, sits at the foot of that hill, just across the road from the crumbling ruins of AS Roma’s first stadium, and the Non-Catholic Cemetery. Back at the restaurant, some of the interior walls have been replaced with glass, allowing diners to ponder the age and origins of those neatly stacked clay pots, buried so many centuries ago. The main draw, however, is the food. Along with the classics, you’ll find sweetbreads, tongue, fettuccine with chicken giblets and a plate of rigatoni with pajata, the intestines of unweaned calves that still contain mother’s milk and produce a creamy sauce when cooked in a tomato base. The roasted rabbit cacciatora is also exceptional. • Via di Monte Testaccio, 97, lunch 12.30pm-3.00pm, dinner 7.45pm-11.00pm, ristorantevelavevodetto.it Felice a Testaccio This is another favourite in Testaccio. Many swear that Da Felice’s cacio e pepe with tonnarelli (square spaghetti) is the best in the city, but if such a cheesy sauce isn’t your thing, don’t worry because there’s not a bad dish on the menu. For the more adventurous, pajata is also available, or rigatoni with an oxtail or slow-cooked lamb sauce. This restaurant has been around since 1936 and has a dedicated clientele, so book a day or two in advance. • Via Mastro Giorgio 29, lunch 12.30pm-3pm, dinner 7pm-11.30pm, feliceatestaccio.it Latteria Garbatella This stylish cocktail bar run by two friends in the ground floor of a residential building has a great outdoor space for evening drinks in warmer months. The interior decor is full-on hipster, and as such could really be in any big city these days, but the courtyard space, surrounded by old apartment blocks with faded paint and crumbling plasterwork, is typical Rome, making it a perfect option for anyone looking for an aperitivo with a local vibe, or late-night drinks. The cocktails are superb and there’s a small but excellent selection of food. • Piazza Geremia Bonomelli, 9, Tues-Sat 6pm–2am, Sunday 10am–midnight, latteriagarbatella.com Getting there BA, easyJet, Ryanair, Jet2, Alitalia, Jet2, Flybe and Vueling all fly to Rome from several UK airports from £38 one way.

Arriving at our friends’ house, we found that it, too, was a single room deep and extremely long. “Did this style of house have a name?” I asked over a cup of tea and the best slice of jam-and-buttercream-filled Victoria sponge I’ve eaten since my granny passed away (recipe requested: it is from Annie Rigg). “Welsh long houses” was the satisfying reply, at which a book by Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peate was put on the table. House plans are the next best thing to having a nose-around and, even in a teatime chat about Welsh architecture, it is hard not to slip into potential buyer mode looking at them – assessing size, light and the best bedroom. Peate’s book – decades of work documenting this important part of Welsh history – is full of plans illustrating these houses, often with a stall for animals at one end (possibly a dairy) and the human living quarters at the other. As in life, my eyes end up on the kitchen, at the heart of which is always a large fireplace or hearth. In Welsh, the word for hearth is aelywyd, in Latin focus, which comes from the Italian fuoco (fire), the same root as the English word “focus”. Before ovens, bread was cooked on the hearth, the dough laid on the stone, maybe covered with hot ashes, and baked. In Italy, hearth bread was called panis foculis, which is the origin of the word “focaccia”, a yeasted dough cooked quickly. Over time, focaccia has taken on different forms and, depending on where you are in Italy, it now means different things. In Liguria, it is about 2cm high with childlike dimples, glistening with olive oil and crystals of salt. Focaccia Pugliese is much deeper, often with tomatoes pressed into the cushion-like dough, which then bake into it like deeply set red buttons. Hearth breads are also the ancestors of pizza; the difference – usually – is that pizza has less yeast, which makes it flatter. But this is not the case in Rome: the pizza bianca of my local bakery is plumper than the flaky, cracker-like focaccia of a nearby pizzeria. Not that I am fussing about size or semantics – I am happy when either is brought to me hot from the oven, glistening with olive oil and strewn with salt that clings to lips and fingers. For me, focaccia is inextricably linked to my teacher Carla Tomasi, because when she gives a lesson or makes you lunch, there is inevitably one baking in the oven when you arrive – a warm, yeasty welcome that seems to sum her up. Her recipe makes a focaccia that is just the right point between tender and chewy. It calls for 200g ‘00’ flour, 200g strong bread flour, a teaspoon of fast-action dry yeast, a teaspoon of fine salt, a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil and 300ml of tepid water mixed into a soft, slightly sticky and shaggy ball in a bowl, which is covered and left to rest for at least 15 minutes. You then turn the dough on to an oiled worktop and knead it gently for a few minutes before returning to the oiled bowl for an hour. By now, the dough should be as soft and pliable as warm putty, and ready to be pressed into a large bread tin – or two smaller ones. Then it is left to rest for another hour, before being given deep dimples with oily fingers and baked at 190C/375F/gas 5 for 25 minutes, or until puffed up and the colour of a polished cymbal. To finish, brush with more olive oil and sprinkle with salt and chopped rosemary, then serve while still warm. True, this all demands time, but not from the cook, as most of it is resting, which – because we know – is when good things happen.","Id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/29/rachel-roddy-authentic-italian-recipe-focaccia","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webTitle":"Rachel Roddy's recipe for focaccia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/29/rachel-roddy-authentic-italian-recipe-focaccia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/29/rachel-roddy-authentic-italian-recipe-focaccia","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":677,"webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T11:00:21Z","id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/29/rachel-roddy-authentic-italian-recipe-focaccia","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for chickpea pancakes","body":"The routine is always the same when we arrive at our house in Sicily. It is invariably late and everyone is cross. Turn on the tap to see if there is water (50/50 chance), yank up blinds, take visible bags inside but leave boot full, go to the pizzeria. It isn’t pizza we are looking for: it is ragu- and pea-filled rice balls called arancine, a cold beer and panelle. Deep-fried squares of chickpea flour batter that taste both nutty and creamy, panelle, like chips, are almost always good, even when they are not. Eaten in the piazza, the air thick and warm, they sate our hunger as the seatbelt creases fade. Panelle are a legacy of ninth-century Arab domination in Sicily. They are made by cooking the chickpea flour with water like polenta, until thick enough to set and then be sliced and fried. There are other recipes that use chickpea flour batter in Italy, mostly coastal towns, which suggests seafaring migration, maybe – a girl and a chickpea recipe in every port, or something like that. There is the baked farinata of Genoa, scented with rosemary and served in slices; the baked cecina or torta di ceci of Livorno in Tuscany, sandwiched in foccacia, and fainé in Sassari. After a drink or three, we plan for a chickpea odyssey, driving the length of Italy in search of them all, but until we do, we make them at home. I was committed to deep-frying panelle and baking farinata in the oven until the chef Claire Thomson arrived in my kitchen with a bottle of batter and got out a frying pan. Chickpea flour pancakes are made by shallow-frying, as you would ordinary pancakes, but have a particular flavour: the nutty, creamy savoury/sweetness of chickpeas with something newly sprouted; also crisp edges and an almost custardy middle. It was a stove eureka moment, and we have been making them at least once a week ever since. I have come to feel about bags of chickpea flour as I once did about packets of cigarettes: one on the go, one spare at all times. Chickpea flour is pastel yellow, and rather like talcum and cocoa in that it has an incredible fineness: stick a finger in and it is has a pleasing, silky nothingness. For pancakes, whisk 250g chickpea flour, 450ml cold water and a big pinch of salt into a batter with the consistency of smooth single cream. It then needs to sit for at least two and up to 24 hours, in which time it will bubble and thicken a little. When it is time to fry, heat a generous tablespoon of olive oil in a small, nonstick frying pan and add a ladleful of batter, then swish it round as you would a pancake, aiming for something about 5mm thick. Once the edges are crisp, lift to check the underside. When it is deep golden, flip and cook the other side, then slide on to a plate. A favourite partner for these pancakes is a small heap of twice-cooked greens – broccoli, spinach or chard, boiled briefly, drained, then cooked again in olive oil with a little garlic and chilli, with ricotta or salted ricotta on top. Alternatively, (and hoping this column feels like ongoing episodes, rather than a series of one-offs) the braised peas and spring onion from two weeks ago. In summer, a red pepper and tomato stew called peperonata is an absolutely delicious sidekick, as is sweet-and-sour caponata, making the pancakes feel rather Sicilian.","Id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/30/rachel-roddy-recipe-chickpea-pancakes","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webTitle":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for chickpea pancakes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/30/rachel-roddy-recipe-chickpea-pancakes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/30/rachel-roddy-recipe-chickpea-pancakes","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":587,"webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T11:00:11Z","id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/30/rachel-roddy-recipe-chickpea-pancakes","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Germany and Spain ease lockdown as Eurozone slumps 3.8% – as it happened","body":"12.16am BST We’ve launched a brand new blog at the link below.

I’ll have the blog for the next few hours, so please do get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: UK prime minister says the country now ‘past the peak’. Boris Johnson defended the decisions the UK government has taken. Speaking at the UK government’s daily press conference, Johnson said that the NHS has not been overwhelmed at any stage. Trump claims he has seen evidence of Covid-19 originating in Wuhan lab. When asked if he has seen anything that gives you a “high degree of confidence” that coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, President Trump replied: “Yes, I have.” Germany eases lockdown measures. Germany is to re-open museums, galleries, zoos and playgrounds and allow religious services to resume, in measures agreed by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the leaders of 16 federal states. Brazil sees record 7,218 new cases, raising the total to 85,380, Reuters reports the health ministry saying on Thursday.The death toll rose by 435 to 5,901. Denmark says partial reopening has not accelerated virus spread. Denmark became the first country outside of Asia to ease lockdown measures a fortnight ago. Spain allocates times slots for outdoor activities, as death toll falls. Spain’s daily death toll fell to its lowest level in nearly six week, with 268 fatalities related to Covid-19 recorded overnight. Eurozone records 3.8% slump, as European Central Bank chief warns of worse to come, with the eurozone potentially on course for a 15% collapse in output in the second quarter. Another 3.8 million Americans lose jobs as US unemployment continues to grow. The pace of layoffs appears to be slowing, but in just six weeks an unprecedented 30 million Americans have now sought unemployment benefits. Covid-19 outbreak increasing across Africa, WHO warns. World Health Organization officials in Africa have said the Covid-19 outbreak is still increasing across the continent despite widespread efforts at containment. Russian prime minister diagnosed with coronavirus. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has said he has been diagnosed with coronavirus and will self-isolate from the government in the country’s highest-profile case of the disease yet.

War-torn Yemen reports first virus deaths. The country reported its first two deaths and a new cluster of Covid-19 cases amid worries that the virus has been circulating undetected for some time. Czechs say coronavirus spread is contained as country reopens. The Czech Republic has seen the number of new cases drop below 100 for the past eight consecutive days. People out of work in Germany increased by 373,000 to 2.64 million in April. Data from the labour office also showed the unemployment rate increased to 5.8%, up from 5% in March, as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. 11.34pm BST US state and local governments could need close to $1 trillion in aid over several years to cope with the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned. She told reporters: “We’re not going to be able to cover all of it, but to the extent that we can keep the states and localities sustainable, that’s our goal.” Asked if state and local aid would be the largest part of upcoming relief legislation, Pelosi said: “I’ve talked about almost a trillion dollars right there, I would hope so. But we do have other issues that we want to deal with.” President Donald Trump said he would “think about what’s happening.” 11.32pm BST Canada’s coronavirus curve is flat but worrying trends are emerging, particularly outbreaks in vulnerable indigenous communities, the country’s top medical officer said. The daily death toll in Canada has risen by 10 pr cent or more only once in the last 11 days. The total number of people killed by the coronavirus increased by 6% to 3,082 in a day, official data showed on Thursday. “The COVID-19 curve is flat ... (but) we have to be very cautious going down the other side of the epidemic curve,” chief public health officer Theresa Tam told a briefing. “Already on this path we have seen some worrisome transmission events emerging,” she said, citing increasing cases in remote aboriginal communities in several of Canada’s 10 provinces. Meanwhile, Alberta unveiled a plan to reopen its economy gradually, starting on Monday with some non-urgent surgeries, golf courses and services such as physiotherapists and social workers. The next stage begins as early as May 14, reopening retail businesses, hair salons, daycares and restaurants. Moving to that stage hinges on increased testing and contact tracing, and rules for using masks in crowded spaces. Alberta has not set dates for reopening schools. Ontario, which has not set dates to restart its economy, issued more than 60 guidelines for businesses when they reopen, ranging from markers and barriers to maintain physical distancing, and additional labor inspectors to ensure compliance. 11.20pm BST Friday’s Guardian leads on Boris Johnson announcing the UK has passed the peak of Covid-19 cases.

Mayor Eric Garcetti announced the free testing on Wednesday, saying they are available to anyone in the county of roughly 10 million people, although priority would be given to healthcare workers and people showing symptoms of Covid-19. He said: “If you think you have Covid-19, if want the reassurance that you do not, if you’ve been around people that you have seen with symptoms, get a test. “You can’t put a price on the piece of mind of knowing that you can’t infect somebody around you.” The tests were funded in part by CORE, a nonprofit organisation co-founded by actor Sean Penn, using a $375,000 grant from the Rockefeller Foundation.

Photograph: Chris Pizzello/AP 9.45pm BST The EU’s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, denies claims that a report alleging disinformation tactics by the Chinese government during the pandemic was edited because of pressure from Chinese authorities. Borrell said the original version was changed because his staff wanted to “avoid inaccuracies in our terminology”. He added: “It was decided by the staff without any interference or pressure from outside or inside. We do not shy away from calling out clear disinformation cases by China, which are in the report.” Related: EU foreign policy chief denies report on China disinformation altered 9.36pm BST Amazon announced it had revenues of $75.4bn in the first three months of the year – equating to over $33m an hour.

The protest appeared to be the largest in the state since April 15, when supporters of President Donald Trump organised thousands of people for “Operation Gridlock,” jamming the streets of Lansing with their cars to call out what they said was the overreach of Whitmer’s strict stay-at-home order. The slow reopening of state economies around the country has taken on political overtones, as Republican politicians and individuals affiliated with Trump’s re-election promoted such protests in electoral swing states, such as Michigan. Many people at Thursday’s “American Patriot Rally”, including militia group members carrying firearms and people with pro-Trump signs, appeared to be ignoring state social distancing guidelines as they clustered together within six feet of each other. 9.22pm BST Here’s a report from our South American correspondent Tom Phillips outlining the growing concerns in Brazil over Bolsonaro’s approach to coronavirus. The president has previously attacked what he termed the “hysteria” over Covid-19, sacked his health minister and has sabotaged efforts to enforce social distancing measures.

The death toll rose by 435 to 5,901, it said. There has been outrage in the country over the approach of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. Earlier in the week, when asked by reporters about deaths exceeding the 5,000 figure, he said: “So what … I’m sorry. What do you want me to do?” Updated at 9.29pm BST 8.45pm BST The California governor, Gavin Newsom, has ordered beaches in Orange County to close until further notice. He made the announcement, days after tens of thousands of people in Orange County packed beaches during a sunny weekend. The governor said he hoped the order would not last very long, but felt it was necessary to protect public health. He said the order only applied to beaches in Orange County. Several California coastal communities have allowed beaches to be open with some restrictions. Updated at 8.49pm BST 8.28pm BST A group of Serbian opposition leaders staged a protest during an evening curfew to voice their criticism of the populist government’s measures against the new coronavirus. Also on Thursday, thousands banged pots and blew whistles from their windows and balconies, even as authorities eased a previously announced 83-hour curfew planned for the upcoming weekend. Serbia’s populist government in mid-March introduced some of the harshest measures in Europe, imposing a state of emergency, banning people over 65 years old from leaving their homes and imposing daily and weekend curfews. Government critics have insisted that the authorities of the autocratic President Aleksandar Vučić have used the state of emergency to curb democracy and media freedoms. Vučić has denied this. Leaders of several opposition parties gathered at the start of the curfew at 6pm, holding speeches outside the Serbian parliament building in Belgrade. They wore masks but didn’t fully respect social-distancing measures. No opposition supporters were invited to the protests, but some supporters of the government showed up, shouting at the opposition leaders. No major incidents were reported. The curfew initially was meant to last until Monday morning to prevent people from socialising during the May Day holiday, but the government earlier on Thursday shortened the ban, following public pressure. Serbia has reported 9,009 infections while 179 people have died. The Balkan country has started easing the measures, but experts have warned that the situation is still volatile. Updated at 8.46pm BST 8.11pm BST The number of deaths from Covid-19 in Peru has surpassed 1,000, the country’s ministry of health said on Thursday. The ministry said the number of deaths had risen to 1,051 from 943 the previous day, while the number of cases had risen by 3,045 to 36,976. Peru has the second highest number of confirmed cases and deaths in Latin America. Police and soldiers closed a busy food market in the capital Lima after mass rapid testing confirmed more than 160 of its traders had tested positive. Updated at 8.47pm BST 7.54pm BST South Africa reported another 297 positive cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, bringing the total in the country to 5,647, the health department said. “The total number of tests conducted to date is 207,530, of which 10,403 were done in the last 24 hours,” the Ministry of Health said. Deaths remained at 103. Wednesday’s increase of 354 in infections was the highest in a 24-hour cycle. South Africa’s five-week strict national lockdown ends on Friday, but with only a clutch of industries being allowed to operate in a bid to keep the economy going while keeping the spread of the virus at bay. Updated at 8.11pm BST 7.40pm BST A rise in cases of Covid-19 across northern Nigeria has seen several states controversially deport hundreds of “almajiris” - mostly children, studying in Islamic boarding schools - back to their states of origin. The states, most in Nigeria’s majority Muslim north, say the deportations are to halt the spread of Covid-19. Yet the deportations of mostly vulnerable children appear to be spreading it across states where the capacity to trace and test for Covid-19 is extremely limited. This afternoon, the Kaduna state government, in north-west Nigeria, said 16 new cases of Covid-19 were of almajiris, recently deported from neighbouring Kano state, where hundreds of unexplained deaths have occured in the last week. Doctors in Kano told the Guardian there has been a rise in pneumonia cases in recent weeks, heightening fears of a Covid-19 outbreak. The mass deportations of vulnerable children, who may have Covid-19 has caused alarm in Nigeria. Almajiris, enrolled in conservative Islamic schools, are often sent away from their homes without school fees, with many resorting to begging on the streets. As extreme poverty has grown, the system has become increasingly exploited. In the last 6 months, several almajiri schools have been shut after it emerged thousands were being enslaved, tortured and sexually abused. Authorities have been accused of ill treatment, with reports of almajiris being left in other states without protection. State-to-state deportations are contentious yet do occur in Nigeria, where state rights are sensitive. The increasing deportations of these children, some of whom appear to have Covid-19, moving between poor states with limited health services is worrying. Their health infrastructure to test or trace for the spread of Covid-19 is severely limited. Nigeria overall is struggling to boost testing, with just 13,000 tests administered. The number of confirmed infections across the country is relatively low - 1.728 - but the daily rise in new cases has been gradually accelerating. Updated at 7.48pm BST 7.27pm BST The New York state governor, Andrew Cuomo, said the New York subway will close between 1am and 5am from 7 May to allow the MTA to disinfect the carriages, train and stations, to protect essential workers from contracting coronavirus. Updated at 7.40pm BST 7.18pm BST The Czech Republic will allow cultural and sports events involving up to 100 people to go ahead from 11 May as part of the next phase of relaxing restrictions imposed to combat the spread of the coronavirus, officials said. This will include cinema screenings, theatre performances and religious services. The move comes sooner than the government had originally planned after it said the spread of the virus was now contained. Large events, however, such as music festivals due this summer with thousands of people, will not take place, the culture minister, Lubomír Zaorálek, said. The country of 10.7 million people is cautiously opening up its economy after it shut schools, shops and restaurants in March and imposed a lockdown. The Czech Republic has seen the number of new cases drop below 100 for the past eight days, and the number of active cases has also been on the decline. Stores of up to 2,500 square metres reopened on Monday. From 11 May, shopping malls and larger shops are also set to reopen, along with outdoor restaurants and pubs, hairdressers, and museums. The last phase is due on 25 May with restaurants, pubs and hotels returning to action. Updated at 7.50pm BST 7.09pm BST Summary Denmark says partial reopening has not accelerated virus spread Authorities in Denmark, became the first country outside of Asia to ease lockdown measures a fortnight ago, said the spread of Covid-19 had not accelerated. Day care centres and schools began reopening in the Nordic country two weeks ago, followed by hairdressers and other small businesses on 20 April. The move came after the number of infections and deaths slowed. Spain allocates times slots for outdoor activities, as death toll falls Health authorities in Spain have said time slots for specific outdoor activities will be used to help the country avoid confusion and further contagion when adults are allowed out on Saturday to exercise for the first time since mid-March. Spain’s daily death toll fell to its lowest level in nearly six week, with 268 fatalities related to Covid-19 recorded overnight. Eurozone records 3.8% slump, as ECB chief warns of worse to come The head of the European Central Bank has warned that the eurozone could be on course for a 15% collapse in output in the second quarter as evidence of the economic toll caused by Covid-19 pandemic started to emerge, with France and Italy falling into recession. Another 3.8 million Americans lose jobs as US unemployment continues to grow Another 3.8 million people lost their jobs in the US last week as the coronavirus pandemic continued to batter the economy. The pace of layoffs appears to be slowing, but in just six weeks an unprecedented 30 million Americans have now sought unemployment benefits and the numbers are still growing. Covid-19 outbreak increasing across Africa, WHO warns World Health Organization officials in Africa have said the Covid-19 outbreak is still increasing across the continent despite widespread efforts at containment. Unlike developed countries that can rely on relatively well-resourced health systems to treat large numbers of sick people, most African nations are hoping they can slow the spread of the disease to protect very limited facilities. Russian prime minister diagnosed with coronavirus Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has said he has been diagnosed with coronavirus and will self-isolate from the government in the country’s highest-profile case of the disease yet. Russia recorded a record daily rise in cases, taking the total of cases past 100,000. On Thursday 7,099 new cases were recorded, bringing the nationwide tally to 106,498. UK prime minister says the country now ‘past the peak’ The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson- who was himself seriously ill with Covid-19 - said that the country has past its peak, and defended the decisions the UK government has taken. Speaking at the UK government’s daily press conference, Johnson said that the NHS has not been overwhelmed at any stage Tajikistan reports first coronavirus cases Tajikistan, which was thought to be one of the few countries untouched by coronavirus, has recorded its first coronavirus cases.

This will take place under strict conditions. Certain states have already allowed some of these activities to restart, but measures on people keeping physical distance from each other will stay in place. Large-scale public gatherings will remain banned until the end of August. “We must work to make sure we bring the number of new infections down further,” Merkel said. “If the infection curve becomes steep again, we need to have a warning system to notice it early and be able to act.” Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel speaks during a press conference. Photograph: Kay Nietfeld/AP Updated at 7.34pm BST 6.46pm BST The French government has unveiled its coronavirus map dividing the country into “green” areas, where lockdown regulations will be relaxed, and “red” areas, where strict measures will remain in place. A number of departments were declared “orange”, meaning they will be watched closely over the next week before being declared red or green on 7 May. France has been under one of the most strict lockdowns since 17 March, with people facing heavy fines for leaving home without good reason. The lockdown is due to end on 11 May. Three criteria were used to decide what people living in the 96 mainland departments and five overseas departments would be allowed to do when the national confinement finishes: the number of new Covid-19 cases in the previous seven days; the capacity of the department’s hospitals to deal with the epidemic; and the department’s ability to test, track and contain the virus. The health minister, Olivier Véran, said the maps were only indicative at this stage. “The map changes nothing of the lockdown until 11 May. Don’t change what you are doing. Stay at home until 11 May,” Véran said. The definitive map, used to determine who can do what and where after 11 May, will be published on 7 May. The “gross” figure in the updated numbers is the number of new admissions to hospital or intensive care; the net number is the increase or reduction taking into account the number of people admitted against those who have died or been discharged. Jérôme Salomon, the head of Publique Santé France, the French health authority, gave the updated figures. Number of cases: 129,581 Number in hospital: 26,283 (+1,048 gross, -551 net) Number in i/c: 4,019 (+121 gross, -188 net) Deaths in hospital: 15,244 (+191) Deaths in homes: 9,132 (+98) Total deaths: 24,376 (+289) Updated at 7.46pm BST 6.38pm BST In Ghana, confirmed coronavirus cases have surged above 2,000, increasing 24% in a matter of days, health officials announced. The Ghana Health Service reported 403 new cases, bringing the total to 2,074. The spike was announced ten days after President Nana Akufo-Addo eased a three-week lockdown in the capital of Accra and in the city of Kumasi. Indian Ocean island nation of Comoros announced its first confirmed case, making it the 53rd of Africa’s 54 countries to report Covid-19. Only the small southern African kingdom of Lesotho has not reported a single case of the disease. African nations have now reported more than 37,400 cases, including 1,598 deaths, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

Mishustin disclosed that he was infected during a video call with Vladimir Putin, Russian state news agencies reported on Thursday evening. It wasn’t immediately clear how severe Mishustin’s case of the disease was, although one news agency reported that he had an elevated temperature of 39 degrees. Mishustin has been tasked with leading the government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, which surpassed 100,000 cases in Russia on Thursday. First deputy prime minister Andrei Belousov would take on his duties in his absence, Mishustin said. “Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich, I have just found out that the tests I gave for coronavirus have come back positive. Accordingly … I will go into self-isolation, fulfilling my doctors’ orders. This is necessary to do in order to protect my colleagues,” Mishustin reportedly told Putin during a video call. Putin has led semi-regular video calls with members of the government from his residence at Novo-Ogaryovo. He has not been pictured with other members of the government in the last several weeks. Updated at 6.57pm BST 6.08pm BST As nations around the world are wondering what a good lockdown exit strategy looks like, Spain has released details about the time slots during which adults will be allowed outside to walk and exercise, reports Sam Jones in Madrid. And it looks pretty rigid: The health minister, Salvador Illa, said that people will be allowed out to walk or take other exercise from 6am to 10am and then from 8pm until 11pm. People over 70, and those who need help walking, or who rely on carers, will be allowed out from 10am to midday, and then from 7pm til 8pm. Parents will be able to accompany children aged under 14 on walks between midday and 7pm. The new rules come into force first thing on Saturday morning. Walkers are entitled to an hour’s daily exercise within a 1km-radius of home, and while there are no time or distance limits for runners or those taking part in individual sports, they must stay within their home area. Social distancing guidelines must be observed, with people staying at least 1.5m away from others. Illa also said that towns of fewer than 5,000 inhabitants would be exempt from the time restirctions, allowing people to go out to walk or exercise when they wanted. People will also be allowed to return to their fruit and vegetable gardens and allotments to gather produce. The minister said the strict lockdown imposed on 14 March had worked. When the state of emergency began, the daily infection rate was 35% - today it’s at 0.6%. We need to keep acting very wisely and very prudently and follow expert advice. We got into this together and we need to get out of it together. There’s no other way. 6.05pm BST UK Prime Minister says the country now 'past the peak' The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has said that the country has past its peak, and defended the decisions the UK government has taken. Speaking at the UK government’s daily press conference, Johnson – who has just returned to work after a near-death brush with coronavirus, and the birth of his son – said that the NHS has not been overwhelmed at any stage. He says the UK avoided an “uncontrollable and catastrophic” epidemic that could have caused 500,000 deaths. The government has faced criticism for not giving the public a clear idea of what its exit strategy from the coronavirus lockdown might look like. He said he will publish a comprehensive plan next week, which will cover three things: how to restart the economy; how to get children back to school; and how to get people into work. So far, so simple. There will be five key tests: The ability to protect the NHS and its ability to cope A sustained fall in deaths A falling infection rate A solution to the challenges of testing and PPE Confidence that a second peak will not overwhelm the NHS For all the live updates from that press conference please do visit our UK coronavirus liveblog: Related: UK coronavirus news: 'We are past the peak' says Boris Johnson as deaths in all settings rise by 674 Updated at 6.08pm BST 5.38pm BST Last bit on Sweden (for now): Alberto Nardelli, Buzzfeed’s Europe editor (and formerly of this parish) did an excellent analysis of the figures earlier this week. He compared the number of deaths in Denmark and Sweden, and argued that the data showed many more people were dying in the latter. It’s a deep dive – but worth the time. Updated at 6.08pm BST 5.12pm BST If, like me, you have become slightly obsessed with the different approach Sweden has taken compared with its Nordic neighbours (just me, then?), this Forbes piece is worth a read. After describing scenes of “normal” life which many European countries are currently only able to dream of, it continues All this follows a handful of mostly optimistic reports from the Public Health Agency in Sweden indicating that the rate of new infections and deaths remains stable even as numbers continue to rise. The number of people in intensive care at any one time has stayed flat, and most of the field hospitals that were set up in March remain empty. Of particular interest are reports that around one quarter of Stockholm (some say even more) is believed to have already had the virus. Though that number has been debated, several experts appear increasingly confident that the number of asymptomatic cases is much higher than initially thought. Now is an especially interesting time to keep an eye on what happens as many countries in Europe, including Sweden’s Nordic neighbors, begin to ease restrictions themselves. Swedish authorities seem to have accepted that infections and deaths would inevitably climb at a certain rate, so the numbers here look much worse than in neighboring countries. Would be very interested to hear from any readers in Sweden about how they feel about their government’s response to the pandemic. You can read more about the nation’s policy from the Guardian’s excellent Europe correspondent Jon Henley, who very recently reported on politicians asking not to be judged prematurely, and comments from its chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, that the lockdown measures taken by other countries now opening up were difficult to justify.

The territorial chief public health officer, Dr Michael Patterson, said: We did anticipate that it was only a matter of time before our territory had a confirmed case, and unfortunately today is that day. We recognize that this news may be frightening. The case was recorded in Pond Inlet, a small community of 1,600 people. Officials have started contact tracing within the community. The government’s rapid response team is expected to arrive in the community on Thursday afternoon. All travel to and from Pond Inlet has been restricted, including travel by air and land. The government has made an exception for cargo and emergency travel. The premier, Joe Savikataaq, said: There is no need to panic. Nunavut has had time to prepare, and we are in a solid position to manage this. We ask people not to place any blame, not to shame and to support communities and each other as we overcome Covid-19 in Nunavut. Health experts have feared the isolated communities in the Arctic, many of which experience chronic overcrowding in homes and disproportionately high rates of respiratory illness, would be among Canada’s most vulnerable to the novel coronavirus. Anna Banerji, the director of global and indigenous health at the University of Toronto’s faculty of medicine, previously told the Guardian: If a whole bunch of people become sick in the Canadian Arctic or in these remote communities, and these people are getting sick from the coronavirus, then what happens? People will die.

The pace of layoffs appears to be slowing, but in just six weeks an unprecedented 30 million Americans have now sought unemployment benefits and the numbers are still growing, writes my colleague Dominic Rushe. The latest figures from the Department of Labor released on Thursday showed a fourth consecutive week of declining claims. While the trend is encouraging, the rate of losses means US unemployment is still on course to reach levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

AP reports: Investigators who responded to a 911 call found that the home had rented four trucks to hold about 50 corpses, according to a law enforcement official. No criminal charges were brought and the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation, spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The Andrew T Cleckley Funeral Home was cited for failing to control the odors. The home was able to obtain a larger, refrigerated truck later in the day, the official said. Workers suited up in protective gear could be seen in the afternoon transferring bodies into the refrigerated truck. Updated at 4.31pm BST 4.22pm BST In the US again, Anthony Fauci has today said that states reopening their economies “can’t just leap over things” that would potentially allow the coronavirus to rebound. In an interview on NBC’s Today show, Savannah Guthrie asked Fauci whether the states that are beginning to reopen have the capability to do contact tracing. Fauci responded that while he could not go through a list of each of them, he urged those that don’t have that capability to “go very slowly”. He said: You can’t just leap over things and get into a situation where you’re really tempting a rebound. That’s the thing I get concerned about. I hope they don’t do that. Fauci said states should follow federal guidelines and only begin to reopen if they have a two-week decline in the number of new Covid-19 cases. He cautioned that states must have the capability of identifying, isolating and contact tracing people who test positive because “there will be blips — there’s no doubt”. “When you pull back, there will be cases,” he said. 4.05pm BST In the US, federal guidelines on social distancing will expire tonight and at least two dozen states are set to begin reopening with greater social movement and business activity tomorrow or over the weekend. This is from our US coronavirus liveblog: While Donald Trump is keen for this to happen, his own public health experts are urging extreme caution about states relaxing their own stay-at-home orders (as opposed to mere guidelines).

According to the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of the Population (MoHSPP), 15 confirmed Covid-19 cases had been reported in the country as of 29 April. Health officials had previously said pneumonia was sweeping through the population, according to the report. Here’s a list from Al Jazeera of countries with no confirmed cases of coronavirus: Comoros; Kiribati; Lesotho; Marshall Islands; Micronesia; Nauru; North Korea; Palau; Samoa; Solomon Islands; Tonga; Turkmenistan; Tuvalu; Vanuatu Updated at 4.04pm BST 3.44pm BST Covid-19 outbreak increasing across Africa, WHO warns World Health Organization officials in Africa have said the Covid-19 outbreak is still increasing across the continent despite widespread efforts at containment, writes the Guardian’s Africa correspondent, Jason Burke. Unlike developed countries that can rely on relatively well-resourced health systems to treat large numbers of sick people, most African nations are hoping they can drastically slow the spread of the disease to protect very limited facilities. There are more than 34,000 confirmed cases across the continent, with about a third of those on its northern Mediterranean coast. The statistics are likely to significantly underestimate the true extent of the spread of the disease. Many countries have issued targeted lockdowns in major cities, as well as dusk-to-dawn curfews and restrictions on travel, but most have stopped short of nationwide lockdowns like that in South Africa, citing the economic and social costs of such measures. WHO officials warned that such choices could mean consequences in terms of the spread of Covid-19, but said they recognised the challenge of making tough decisions. They did however express concern at surging numbers of cases in some regions. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO’s director for the Africa region, said: We are very concerned about west Africa where we are seeing some community spread in a significant number of countries compared with others. Senegal, with a population of nearly 16 million, has recorded 933 cases, with nine deaths as of Thursday. The government has declared a state of emergency, closed schools and issued restrictions on gatherings and travel, but cases have continued to rise. There are also concerns that outbreaks are not being recognised. There are unconfirmed reports from local doctors and media of large numbers of deaths involving a respiratory illness in Somalia, northern Nigeria and elsewhere. A limited ability to test has slowed investigation. Michel Yao, WHO Africa’s emergency operations manager, said identification by symptoms could be enough if there had already been confirmed cases of Covid-19 in a given area. In South Africa, which now has 5,350 confirmed Covid-19 cases and more than 100 deaths, the peak of the outbreak is likely to be between July and September, depending on how the disease evolves during the southern hemisphere’s winter and the impact of containment measures, the health minister, Zweli Mkhize, said. A strict lockdown imposed five weeks ago in South Africa will be marginally softened tomorrow (Friday), with some exercise now allowed and a handful of designated industries returning to work. Prof Salim Abdool Karim, the principal government adviser on Covid-19, said South Africa had performed better than developed countries in slowing transmission, although the number of cases has continued to rise. He said: We have got quite clear evidence that we have flattened the curve and that the number of cases we are seeing, and the number of infections probably occurring, has declined quite substantially. Deep problems remain, however, with a shortage of trained medical personnel still a major concern. Updated at 5.28pm BST 3.30pm BST Denmark says partial reopening has not accelerated virus spread More news from Denmark, where authorities say the spread of Covid-19 has not accelerated since it became the first country outside of Asia to ease lockdown measures a fortnight ago. Day care centres and schools began reopening in the Nordic country two weeks ago, followed by hairdressers and other small businesses on 20 April. The move came after the number of infections and deaths slowed. “There are no signs that the Covid-19 epidemic is accelerating,” the State Serum Institute, which is responsible for preparedness against infectious diseases, said. Officers of the Danish North Jutland police walk behind a warning sign calling on people to keep apart from each other as they patrol in Aalborg, Denmark. Photograph: Henning Bagger/EPA The “R rate”, which indicates the average number of infections one person with the virus causes, increased slightly in the past two weeks but remained below 1.0, it said. Earlier this week, Germany announced its R rate had edged up back to 1.0 after a lockdown relaxation. Denmark, which was one of the first nations in Europe to shut down, had 452 coronavirus-related deaths as of Thursday, with the number of hospitalisations falling steadily during April. “There are no signs whatsoever that the partial reopening has caused a bigger spread of infection,” said Christian Wejse, a scientist at the department of infectious diseases at Aarhus University. “At least there is no indication that we are heading into another wave. That has been the concern, but I can’t see that at all,” he told Reuters. Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said yesterday that the spread of the virus was “under control” and that she would present a plan for the next steps in the reopening before 10 May. “We are by no means home safe, but we have a really good starting point now to get the number of infected further down,” Wejse said. Updated at 3.47pm BST 3.16pm BST Scientists have found evidence for mutations in some strains of the coronavirus that suggest the pathogen may be adapting to humans after spilling over from bats. The analysis of more than 5,300 coronavirus genomes from 62 countries shows that while the virus is fairly stable, some have gained mutations, including two genetic changes that alter the critical “spike protein” the virus uses to infect human cells. Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stress that it is unclear how the mutations affect the virus, but since the changes arose independently in different countries, they may help the virus spread more easily. The spike mutations are rare at the moment but Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases and a senior author on the study – which has yet to be published in a journal or peer reviewed – said their emergence highlighted the need for global surveillance of the virus so that more worrying changes could be picked up fast. Hibberd said: This is exactly what we need to look out for. People are making vaccines and other therapies against this spike protein because it seems a very good target. We need to keep an eye on it and make sure that any mutations don’t invalidate any of these approaches.” Studies of the virus revealed early on that the shape of its spike protein allowed it to bind to human cells more efficiently than Sars, a related virus that caused an outbreak in 2002. The difference may have helped the latest coronavirus infect more people and spread rapidly around the world. Scientists will be concerned if more extensive mutations in the spike protein arise, not only because they may alter how the virus behaves. The spike protein is the main target of leading vaccine programmes around the world, and if it changes too much those vaccines may no longer work. Other potential therapies, such as synthetic antibodies that home in on the spike protein, could be less effective, too.

Now French commuters are being urged to swap cars for bicycles when the Covid-19 lockdown ends. The government has announced plans to develop temporary bike lanes, with an additional €20m subsidy towards the cost of repairs. The initiative, by the energy and transport ministry, also includes an increase in bicycle parking spaces and training to get people back in the saddle.

Speaking after a video conference of foreign ministers from countries involved in mediation efforts, Heiko Maas agreed on a series of points. Maas agreed with his counterparts from France, Ukraine and Russia that there needed to be increased prisoner exchanges between the warring parties, efforts to ensure retired people in the east could access their Ukrainian pensions and more crossing points to add to the five currently in place along the 500km of the contact line. “In recent times too many excuses have been found to hesitate,” he said of a faltering implementation of a ceasefire, calling for observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to be given unhindered access. “The health concerns in the pandemic must not be used as an excuse.” But Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said that Kiev and Moscow were still far from finalising a prisoner swap of all inmates. The conflict, which broke out in 2014, has killed more than 13,000 people, left a large swathe of Ukraine de facto controlled by the separatists and aggravated the deepest east-west rift since the cold war. Updated at 3.04pm BST 2.39pm BST More from Italy, where it emerged earlier the economy has gone into recession, with the country’s prime minister announcing some regions might be able to unwind Covid-19 restrictions more rapidly than others. But the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, also warned local authorities against rushed, unilateral rollbacks. It comes after Italy, which has registered the highest coronavirus death toll in Europe with 27,682 fatalities, has endured some of the world’s toughest lockdown measures. But, according to Reuters, regions run by rightwing parties – which are not part of the ruling government coalition – have kicked back against plans for a gradual, nationwide easing of curbs, saying the proposed schedule, due to start on Monday, is too timid. Highlighting the growing discord, Calabria, in the south-west of the country, announced that bars and restaurants in its region can reopen immediately so long as they have outdoor tables - a month ahead of the government’s proposed schedule. In a speech to parliament, Conte said he would be willing to work with regions in future to enable them to relax measures more quickly if they had particularly low rates of infection. “There will not be a plan based on sudden initiatives by individual local authorities, but rather one based on scientific findings,” he said, warning that a quick end to curbs could fuel the contagion and lead to a surge in infections. He added: I’ll say this clearly, at the risk of appearing unpopular. The government cannot immediately ensure a return to normality ... we are still in this pandemic.” Autonomous moves by regions would be considered illegitimate, he added, opening the way for confrontations with regional chiefs set on defying the central government.

I’ll do my best to keep you updated with developments over the next hour or so. 2.11pm BST There’s a series of updates on the situation in the UK after a briefing of political journalists over on our UK coronavirus liveblog. It appears increasingly unlikely that there will be any major change to the current lockdown next week after the prime minister’s spokesman again played down the prospect, saying it would be wrong to “gamble away” what has already been achieved. No 10 has been transmitting this message for some days, but this seemed to be an even stronger hint that people should not expect too much from the review of the lockdown due by Thursday next week. The spokesman said: We don’t want to relax the social distancing measures or do anything which could lead to the virus, which the British public have done so much to suppress, being able to spread in an exponential way again, and that will guide our approach as we move forward. People have made huge sacrifices in order to bring down the rate of infection, to protect the NHS and ultimately to save lives and we are not going to gamble those sacrifices away by taking steps that could lead to an exponential growth in the disease again. When asked if the lockdown could continue until June, the spokesman said people would have to wait for the government decision. But he also reminded reporters of what Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, has said about how the virus will be around for a significant period of time. The spokesman went on: As the PM himself has said, the worst thing we could do is relax the social distancing measures too soon and throw away all of the progress that has been made. 2.03pm BST My colleague Khushbu Shah has written a great piece from Atlanta, Georgia, where the governor, Brian Kemp, has announced the state will reopen even as coronavirus cases continue to rise, with nearly 25,000 confirmed in the state as of Tuesday afternoon.

Noting the next review lockdown guidance planned for 7 May, she said: “It may well be too early even by this time next week to reduce the current restrictions.” She stressed that “our assessment as of today of the data and the evidence is that it would not be safe” to lift the restrictions. She urged the Scottish public not to ease up on travel restrictions in particular, revealing that there had been a significant increase over the last week.

Updated at 1.27pm BST 1.03pm BST Eye-popping story on the ingenuity of criminals, who are using food delivery services as a cover to transport drugs and other illegal goods during the coronavirus crisis. \uD83D\uDCE3 BREAKING: INTERPOL issues alert on dealers using food delivery services to avoid police detection when transporting drugs during COVID-19 lockdowns. https://t.co/IaM5cwNOeL — INTERPOL (@INTERPOL_HQ) April 30, 2020 Reuters reports: Interpol said it had received reports from police in Ireland, Malaysia, Spain and Britain identifying delivery drivers transporting drugs such as cocaine, marijuana, ketamine and ecstasy. Earlier this month, the Spanish National Police identified and arrested seven people dressed as food delivery drivers in Alicante and Valencia, said Interpol. It added that those involved in the Spanish case were caught delivering cocaine and marijuana by bicycle, motorcycle and car, with some of the drugs concealed inside home delivery backpacks. In Ireland, police recovered 8 kg (17 lbs) of cocaine as well as two handguns hidden in pizza boxes, added Interpol. Updated at 1.06pm BST 1.00pm BST In Germany, a company working with the US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has begun human trials of a potential Covid-19 vaccine that could supply millions by the end of the year, according to the two firms. Pfizer says it will begin testing the experimental vaccine in the United States as early as next week, and says a vaccine could be ready for emergency use in the autumn, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. There’s a CNN report here. Thanks to Guardian reader Claus Schrøder-Hansen for bringing it to my attention. Updated at 1.06pm BST 12.41pm BST Cyprus has released details about how it plans to reopen after its lockdown. The strategy to lift the restrictions and restart the economy has been divided into four phases, which will be adjusted depending on the epidemiological data. Phase one is set to start on 4 May and will include the reopening of the construction sector, retail apart from shopping malls and open markets. By phase 4, set to start on 14 July, theatres and cinemas, festivals and concerts, casinos and play areas are expected to be open. More details on the opening of schools are expected today. The Cyprus Mail has more details here. My thanks to Guardian reader Roger Dawson who flagged this. Updated at 12.58pm BST 12.16pm BST Spain to allocate times slots for outdoor activities Health authorities in Spain have said time slots for specific outdoor activities will be used to help the country avoid confusion and further contagion when adults are allowed out on Saturday to exercise for the first time since mid-March, reports my colleague Sam Jones. Details of the timetable are due to be explained later today by the health minister. They are thought to include a set time for people to run or go out to exercise as families. Children in Spain – which has been in lockdown since 14 March – have been allowed out to exercise with a parent or guardian since last Sunday. Speaking on Spanish radio on Thursday, the transport minister, José Luis Ábalos, said trips outside would be “sequenced” to prevent what he called “an explosive exit”. He told Cadena Ser: It’s a set of measures that will see certain hours agreed with regional and local governments. It will all need to be thoroughly discussed to avoid an explosive exit and so that trips outside with children can happen along with those of couples or people doing sport. Updated at 12.38pm BST 12.05pm BST Summary France has plunged into recession. Data shows that French GDP contracted by 5.8% in the first three months of 2020, a very sharp decline in activity triggered by the coronavirus lockdown. Italy’s economy has entered recession Italian GDP shrank by 4.7% in the first quarter of 2020, new figures from ISTAT show - that is the biggest drop since the data series began in 1995. South Korea reports no new domestic cases for first time since 29 February. South Korea reported on Thursday no new domestic coronavirus cases for the first time since its 29 February peak, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Spain’s daily death toll falls to lowest in nearly six weeks. The number of fatalities related to Covid-19 recorded overnight in Spain was 268. War-torn Yemen reports first virus deaths. The country reported its first two deaths and a new cluster of Covid-19 cases amid worries that the virus has been circulating undetected for some time and attempts at a humanitarian ceasefire to contain the new crisis are failing. Russia cases pass 100,000 with record daily rise. 7,099 new cases were recorded on Thursday, bringing the nationwide tally to 106,498. Czechs say coronavirus spread is contained as country reopens. The Czech Republic has seen the number of new cases drop below 100 for the past eight consecutive days, and the government will continue to cautiously open up the economy, the health minister said. Japan likely to extend nationwide state of emergency over the coronavirus. Prime minister Shinzō Abe is expected to extend the measure until the end of May or until 6 June, as the country’s healthcare system continues to face an “extremely tough situation”, he said. People out of work in Germany increased by 373,000 to 2.64 million in April. Data from the labour office also showed the unemployment rate increased to 5.8%, up from 5% in March, as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. A British pharmaceutical company will know whether it’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate is effective by June or July. AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said the company will continue working with Oxford Vaccine Unit to bring it to patients as soon as possible. 11.56am BST Italy enters recession More disheartening economic news from the eurozone. Italy has joined France in recession, after suffering its worst slump in decades which has wiped out all of the growth since the eurozone crisis, and then some. This from our business live blog: Italian GDP shrank by 4.7% in the first quarter of 2020, new figures from ISTAT show. That is the worst since the data series began in 1995, showing that the coronavirus lockdown measures implemented in recent weeks have had a very damaging impact on growth. It follows a 0.3% contraction in October to December, meaning Italy has notched up two consecutive quarters of contraction.

But clearly there is a flip side to this positive news. IEA head Fatih Birol adds: Given the number of deaths and the economic trauma ... this historic decline in global emissions is absolutely nothing to cheer. The impact of the global coronavirus outbreak will be so significant that renewable electricity will be the only source resilient enough to survive, according to the world’s energy watchdog. This is from the Guardian’s report by energy correspondent Jillian Ambrose. The International Energy Agency said the outbreak of Covid-19 would wipe out demand for fossil fuels by prompting a collapse in energy demand seven times greater than the slump caused by the global financial crisis. In a report, the IEA said the most severe plunge in energy demand since the second world war would trigger multi-decade lows for the world’s consumption of oil, gas and coal while renewable energy continued to grow. The steady rise of renewable energy combined with the collapse in demand for fossil fuels means clean electricity will play its largest ever role in the global energy system this year, and help erase a decade’s growth of global carbon emissions.

The total number of diagnosed cases of the coronavirus in Iran, one of the Middle Eastern countries hardest hit by the outbreak, has reached 94,640, he said. 10.57am BST In his final message, Kluge said Covid-19 “is not going away any time soon” and healthcare systems must adapt accordingly. We must be alert and open to new ways of delivering and receiving healthcare. We cannot risk seeing the tragedy of Covid-19 mirrored in a second catastrophe of ill health from other causes. He said the new Covid-19 Health System Response Monitor, launched by the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, is collating evidence of how health systems are responding to the pandemic. Updated at 11.21am BST 10.54am BST At the daily WHO briefing, Kluge said the WHO remained worried about interruptions to routine vaccinations as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which could result in “collateral damage” to children and vulnerable groups. He warned that measles continues to spread in some parts of Europe, affecting over 6,000 people in the first two months of this year. We cannot allow this situation to worsen. We should do everything within our powers to prevent children becoming victims of this pandemic due to their vulnerability of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, diphtheria, mumps and rubella. Covid-19 cannot be permitted to claim this collateral damage. Updated at 11.21am BST 10.47am BST Of the 44 countries in the European region that have implemented domestic movement restrictions, 21 countries have started easing some of these measures, and a further 11 are planning to do so in the coming days, said Hans Kluge, regional director of the World Health Organization in Europe. Speaking at a daily WHO press briefing, Kluge said countries must remain cautious. As I have said before – this virus is unforgiving – we must remain vigilant, persevere and be patient, ready to ramp up measures as and when needed. He said it was important that during the transition period, healthcare systems have the capacity to “operate along a dual track”, delivering regular health services while also able to respond aggressively to the virus when needed. Updated at 11.20am BST 10.33am BST The regional president of Madrid has been criticised after defending her administration’s decision to contract fast food companies to feed children from low-income families during Spain’s coronavirus lockdown. Children in and around the capital who are normally eligible for free school meals have been receiving pizza and sandwiches from well-known Spanish chains despite worries from nutritionists. Speaking in the regional assembly on Wednesday, Isabel Díaz Ayuso accused her political opponents of using the issue to try to score cheap points. She said: I don’t think giving a kid pizza is a problem. I’m sure you don’t like [these foods] and have never eaten them in your life … but I swear that 100% of children love them. The regional premier took careful aim at critics in the far-left, anti-austerity Unidas Podemos party, claiming that if they were in power, children in Madrid would be eating “Venezuelan meals – which is to say nothing at all”. Nutritionists, however, remain unimpressed by such arguments. “So, 100% of kids love pizza,” the nutritionist and dietician Julio Basulto wrote on Twitter. “Sure they do. But they also love sweets, cakes, ice creams, chocolates, Doritos and Red Bull.” Basulto said that while the odd pizza did not harm, a steady diet of them would lead to an unbalanced diet. He also pointed out that the governments of other Spanish regions had found ways to feed children from poorer families without resorting to fast-food chains. 10.20am BST Spain's daily death toll falls to lowest in nearly six weeks The number of fatalities related to Covid-19 recorded overnight in Spain fell to 268, the lowest in nearly six weeks, the country’s health ministry said. The overall death toll rose to 24,543 on Thursday, up from 24,275 on the previous day, the ministry said. The number of cases registered in the country rose to 213,435 from 212,917 the day before. Updated at 11.16am BST 10.13am BST Japan Airlines’ annual net profit plunged nearly 65%, the company said on Thursday, as it faced the “unprecedented” impact of the coronavirus pandemic on aviation demand. JAL said net profit for the fiscal year ending in March fell 64.6% to 53.4bn yen ($500m) on annual sales of 1.4trn yen, down 5.1%. The results were largely in line with a profit warning the airline issued last week. A Japan Airlines passenger plane on the tarmac at Tokyo’s Haneda airport. Photograph: Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP via Getty Images JAL said demand had plunged owing to entry bans around the world, the cancellation of major domestic events, and a state of emergency in Japan with authorities urging citizens not to travel. “Our group is facing an unprecedented situation,” the company said in a statement. For now, JAL plans to cut its number of flights by 90% on international routes and by more than 60% on domestic routes from its flight schedule announced before the pandemic. But the firm said it remained optimistic about the outlook. It said: The decline in flight demand due to the impact of the new coronavirus is a temporary phenomenon and our mid- and long-term forecast that demand for flights from and to Japan will grow greatly has remained unchanged. 10.05am BST Indonesia confirmed 347 new coronavirus infections on Thursday, taking the total in the south-east Asian country above 10,000 for the first time with 10,118 infections, said the health ministry official Achmad Yurianto. Yurianto reported eight new deaths, taking the total fatalities to 792, while 1,522 have recovered. More than 72,300 people have been tested. Updated at 10.45am BST 10.02am BST Czechs say coronavirus spread contained as country reopens The spread of Covid-19 has been contained in the Czech Republic and the government will continue to cautiously open up the economy, the health minister, Adam Vojtěch, said on Thursday. The country has seen the number of new cases drop below 100 for the past eight consecutive days, and the number of active cases has also been on the decline. The ministry said the reproduction rate of the virus had dropped to 0.7, which means every newly infected person passes the infection to fewer than one other person. There were 7,581 cases in the country as of Thursday morning, and 227 deaths. Positive developments have prompted the government to start reopening shops and services as well as non-urgent medical care, as doctors fear the impact of neglect in standard care. Vojtěch told a press conference: So far we do not see a negative trend resulting from previous relaxations. We will proceed with caution, gradually in the upcoming waves, and I believe we are on a good path. The country has also seen a decline in the number of hospitalised patients, to 348 on Wednesday from a peak of 446 on 9 April. The government, under pressure from businesses and the general population, has lifted most limits on movement and sped up reopening shops and services. Stores of up to 2,500 square metres reopened on Monday. People in Prague hold placards during a protest against the response of the Czech government to the Covid-19 pandemic. Photograph: Michal Čížek/AFP via Getty Images The head of the health ministry’s epidemiological advisory team, Rastislav Mad’ar, has cautioned about the faster relaxations, saying they may be risky. Schools are not to reopen fully until September, and the government is also keeping in place an obligation to wear face masks in public and a ban on large public gatherings. The government is hoping a system of tracing and testing contacts of infected people, newly boosted by an army of testers, mobile apps and location data from phones and payment card transactions, will be enough to contain any flare-ups without the need to reintroduce blanket restrictions. Updated at 10.44am BST 9.54am BST Malaysian health authorities reported 57 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, raising the cumulative total to 6,002 cases. The health ministry also reported two new deaths, bringing the total fatalities to 102. 9.54am BST Schools in Hungary will remain closed until the end of May and events with more than 500 participants cannot be held until 15 August, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s chief of staff, Gergely Gulyás, said on Thursday. Orbán announced on Wednesday that some restrictions outside Budapest imposed to contain the coronavirus outbreak will be lifted, starting next week. Existing restrictions will continue for now in the capital, which has reported the highest number of coronavirus infections and deaths in the country. Updated at 10.40am BST 9.51am BST The German government’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), this morning announced the latest reproduction number of the novel coronavirus as 0.75. Lothar Wieler, the RKI’s president, said the latest official data showed a “pleasing development”, indicating the spread of the virus in Germany was slowing down. The basic reproduction rate (R), which indicates how many new cases one infected person generates on average, had been announced as edging up to one in Monday’s report – causing concern as it seemed to suggest the spread of the virus was regaining momentum. The RKI, which uses a method called nowcasting to estimate the R number, said while it had in recent days tweaked the method by which it estimated the number of new infections, the reproduction numbers from the start and the end of the week were still comparable. Germany on Thursday recorded a total of 159,119 confirmed Covid-19 infections, an increase of 1,478 compared with yesterday. Wieler said the capacity for testing for the virus had been ramped up in Germany, to 860,000 tests a week. 476,000 tests were carried out last week, out of which 5.4% were positive. Updated at 10.39am BST 9.47am BST Sailors at a Sri Lankan naval base have become the biggest cluster of coronavirus infections in the Indian Ocean island nation, with 248 testing positive for the disease, authorities said on Thursday. Sri Lanka’s army chief, Lt Gen Shavendra Silva, said that out of 30 cases discovered in the last 24 hours, 22 are navy sailors and another seven had close contact with them. The virus is believed to have entered the camp on the outskirts of the capital, Colombo, last week when sailors were deployed to find a group of drug addicts who had contact with a Covid-19 patient and were evading quarantine. The virus then spread to different parts of the country when sailors went on home leave. About 4,000 navy troops are being quarantined inside the camp while 242 relatives have been taken to four quarantine centres run by the navy.

About half of the sick were diagnosed after 22 April and include 257 sailors or close contacts. According to the newspaper Lankadeepa, at least six villages have been sealed off this week in different parts of Sri Lanka because of exposure to the sailors who returned home. About 1,300 other people have been asked to self-quarantine, the paper reported. In a bid to control the spread of the virus, the government has cancelled home leaves for troops and ordered them to return to camps. On Wednesday night, Sri Lanka reimposed a 24-hour countrywide curfew, which had been in force since 20 March but was relaxed during daytime in more than two-thirds of the country. Police said they had arrested more than 41,000 curfew violators since last month. Updated at 10.37am BST 9.37am BST The Philippines reported 276 new coronavirus infections and 10 more deaths, bringing its total number of cases to 8,488 and fatalities to 568. It also said 20 more individuals had recovered, bringing total recoveries to 1,043. Updated at 9.57am BST 9.36am BST The number of people out of work in Germany increased by 373,000 to 2.64 million in April as the coronavirus outbreak began to bite, data from the labour office showed on Thursday, and the unemployment rate increased to 5.8%. The jobless rate had stood at 5.0% in seasonally adjusted terms in March. The labour office said 751,000 requests for short-time work for a total of 10.1 million people were made in March and until 26 April. It said that did not mean all of those people would actually end up on the short-time work scheme. For comparison, in the crisis year of 2009, applications for the short-time scheme were made for 3.3 million people, the labour office said. Short-time work is a form of state aid that allows employers to switch employees to shorter working hours during an economic downturn to keep them on the payroll. Updated at 9.56am BST 9.32am BST Luxembourg plans to test its entire population for coronavirus, the education minister, Claude Meisch, said on Tuesday. The small European country, which borders France, Germany and Belgium, has an estimated population of just over 600,000. The Luxembourg Times reports the country has a budget of €40m for the tests, provided by the ministry of higher education and research. During a press conference on Tuesday, Meisch said: We must live with the virus and control it. More testing will give people more freedom. The government is continuing to look into how we can move forward with the deconfinement measures. Testing began on Tuesday, with priority for children who are set to return to school from 4 May. The rest of the population will be tested on a voluntary basis at 17 stations around the country, with cross-border workers also encouraged to be tested. By 19 May, Luxembourg is set to have the capacity to test 20,000 people a day. 9.22am BST In Afghanistan, the health ministry has reported its biggest daily rise of new coronavirus cases amid intensified warfare across the country. Wahid Majroh, the deputy health minister, said on Thursday that 232 patients tested positive for Covid-19 over the last 24 hours, taking the total number of infections to 2,171. Total number of infections: 2171 Daily new infections: New infections: 232 Apr29:110 Apr28: 125 Apr27: 172 Apr26: 68 Apr25: 133 Apr24: 95 Apr23: 83 Apr22: 51 Apr21: 66 Apr20: 30 Death toll: 64 — Akhtar Mohammad Makoii (@akhtar_makoii) April 30, 2020 Three more Covid-19 patients died overnight, pushing the total number of deaths to 64. For days Afghanistan was struggling with a shortage of diagnostic testing equipment. A health ministry spokesman said that problem had now been solved and testing capacity was rising. Kabul is so far the country’s worst-affected area, with 573 confirmed cases and 20 more reported today. Despite lockdowns in several provinces to contain spread of the virus, in most cities streets are still crowded with vehicles and people walking freely, which experts fear will make the fight against the coronavirus more challenging. Health ministry spokesman Wahidullah Mayar warned the public on Wednesday that the peak of the virus is yet to come and said the “number of new infections is rising daily so we’re heading toward the peak and I ask people to stay at home”. Meanwhile, war continues to rage across the country. At least five civilians, including women and children, were killed in Ghazni province Wednesday evening. According to a Ghazni police statement, the incident occurred when a civilian’s vehicle hit a Taliban roadside mine in Andar district. The United Nations mission in Afghanistan has said more than 533 civilians, including 152 children, were killed in the first quarter of 2020. Updated at 9.55am BST 8.58am BST China has no interest in interfering in the US presidential election, it said on Thursday, following comments by President Donald Trump that Beijing “will do anything they can” to make him lose his re-election bid in November. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, told reporters during a daily briefing that the election was an internal affair of the United States and that Beijing hoped Americans would not try to drag China into it. “China will do anything they can to have me lose this race,” Trump said during an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, adding that he believes Beijing wants his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, to win the race to ease the pressure Trump has placed on China over trade, the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic and other issues. Updated at 9.27am BST 8.55am BST The chief executive of British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca said it would know by June or July whether a coronavirus vaccine it is working on with the University of Oxford will be effective or not. CEO Pascal Soriot told the BBC on Thursday: By June, July we will already have a very good idea of the direction of travel in terms of its potential efficacy. We’ll continue working with the Oxford Vaccine Unit to bring it to patients and to regulatory authorities first of all as soon as possible. Updated at 9.12am BST 8.43am BST War-torn Yemen reports first virus deaths Yemen has reported its first two deaths and a new cluster of Covid-19 cases amid worries that the virus has been circulating undetected for some time and attempts at a humanitarian ceasefire to contain the new crisis are failing. Five new cases were confirmed in the southern city of Aden on Wednesday night, leading the local separatist administration - which renewed calls for independence last week - to announce a two-week shutdown. Two of the patients died after testing positive for the coronavirus, officials said overnight. Yemen has previously only reported one case, a port worker in the town of al-Shihr some 540km away. Although he made a full recovery, officials were unable to identify patient zero. A health worker sprays disinfectant to help fight the spread of coronavirus in Sana’a, Yemen. Photograph: Mohammed Hamoud/Getty Images Health workers and aid agencies have been dreading a widespread outbreak of coronavirus in Yemen, where testing facilities are almost non-existent and five years of war have decimated the medical sector. Worst-case scenario planning from the World Health Organization says up to 93% of the population could become infected. The Saudi-led coalition fighting against Iran-backed Houthi rebels announced a unilateral ceasefire last month to help Yemen contain the spread of Covid-19, but fighting in several areas has worsened instead. Coalition airstrikes on Houthi territory increased by 30% last week, war monitor the Yemen Data Project said on Wednesday. Updated at 10.24am BST 8.38am BST Russia cases pass 100,000 with record daily rise Russia reported 7,099 new cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, a record daily rise, bringing its nationwide tally to 106,498. The official nationwide death toll rose to 1,073 after 101 people died in the last 24 hours, Russia’s coronavirus crisis response centre said. Updated at 9.01am BST 8.30am BST The German chancellor Angela Merkel’s chief of staff said on Thursday that social distancing measures in Europe’s largest economy would “certainly” be extended until 10 May for the time being. Helge Braun told broadcaster n-tv a larger discussion about further steps to ease the lockdown would happen on 6 May. Some shops have already reopened. 8.28am BST Japan’s prime minister, Shinzō Abe, is likely to extend a nationwide state of emergency imposed over the coronavirus, possibly by another month, local media reported on Thursday. The measure was initially declared on 7 April across seven regions experiencing a spike in infections, but was later expanded to cover the entire country. With the initial month-long period coming to an end next week after the country’s annual Golden Week holidays, local media reported that Abe was now expected to extend the measure, either until the end of May or for another full month until 6 June. In parliament on Thursday, Abe said the country’s healthcare system continues to face an “extremely tough situation”. He told lawmakers on Wednesday that “even now, we are seeing new infections”, adding: “Can we say on May 6 the state of emergency is over? I think severe situations are continuing.” Local media, including the Nikkei newspaper, reported the government would convene a panel of experts on Friday to discuss the virus and the state of emergency, adding that the experts had already informally backed a move to extend the measures. It was not yet clear when any extension would be announced, but Abe has said he will not wait until the last minute, to allow business and institutions including schools time to prepare accordingly. The declaration has limited effect compared with measures seen in some parts of Europe and elsewhere. It allows governors to call on people to stay at home and urge businesses to close, but there are no punishments for those who fail to comply. Updated at 9.00am BST 8.24am BST The Italian central government is set to issue an injunction, ANSA news agency reports, after authorities in the southern region of Calabria gave the all clear for bars and restaurants with outside tables to reopen, sources said on Thursday after a cabinet meeting. The move is at odds with a central government decree to gradually relax the coronavirus lockdown, which states that bars and restaurants should not reopen until June, except for takeaway services. It also clashes with a previous decree that keeps the current lockdown measures in force until Monday. Regions with centre-right governors are pressing to have more autonomy in deciding how to ease the lockdown. But the regional affairs minister, Francesco Boccia, said on Wednesday that regional governments must move in step with the central government in Rome on relaxing lockdown measures or they will be cited for not complying. He said: The regions must show the same unity as that requested from citizens. Updated at 8.58am BST 8.15am BST Singapore confirmed 528 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, its health ministry said, taking the city state’s total cases to 16,169. Updated at 8.57am BST 8.15am BST AstraZeneca will make and distribute globally the University of Oxford’s potential Covid-19 vaccine, the British drugmaker said on Thursday. The Cambridge-based company did not give details on when it will start producing the vaccine. While there are more than 70 vaccines in development for the coronavirus, industry experts say they expect development of a successful vaccine to take at least 12-18 months, compared with the average vaccine development time of 5-7 years. The company’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said in a statement: Our hope is that, by joining forces, we can accelerate the globalisation of a vaccine to combat the virus and protect people from the deadliest pandemic in a generation. The Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group have been working on a vaccine, called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and said earlier this month large-scale production capacity was being put in place to make millions of doses even before trials show whether it is effective. The team last week dosed the first volunteers in a trial of the vaccine, with possible early readouts in May.

Photograph: PA Updated at 8.56am BST 8.08am BST Potentially some positive news for the job market in all the gloom. Finance, technology and consumer goods firms are hiring tens of thousands in the United States and other countries, according to data from professional networking site LinkedIn. Across seven countries in North America, Europe and Asia, healthcare providers are among the busiest recruiters given the ongoing battle against Covid-19, LinkedIn said. But lifestyle changes during lockdown are also driving demand for financial consultants, factory workers, animators and game designers, and delivery workers. Overall, the hiring rate has plunged in the first quarter from the year-ago period, and in late April remains lower than a year ago across most countries surveyed by the platform. But the data offers a glimmer of hope, with a gradual uptick in China where the coronavirus emerged last year and which leads the world in surfacing from a months-long lockdown. LinkedIn, with over 690 million users worldwide, counts new hires when people add a new employer to their profile. The rate is the number of new hires divided by the total number of LinkedIn members in a country. The figures, tracked since mid-February, are not corroborated by official jobs data and do not represent the actual number of jobs in an economy. Government figures are usually released with a time-lag of several weeks. Guy Berger, principal economist at LinkedIn in California, told Reuters: We are confident that our data is directionally correct in that there has been a huge decline in hiring in the US and abroad. According to the data, hiring in China plummeted 50% during the height of its coronavirus crisis in mid-February, compared with 12 months earlier. Since restrictions were eased in early April, the hiring rate has inched up, and for the week ending 24 April was 3% lower than the same period in 2019. Hiring in the US, UK, France and Italy – which lead the world in coronavirus-related deaths – remains hugely depressed, but is falling less rapidly than a few weeks ago as the countries pass the peak of their epidemics, LinkedIn said. Updated at 8.55am BST 8.02am BST On Sunday Thailand will start reopening some businesses, such as outdoor markets, barber shops and pet groomers, after the number of new coronavirus infections dropped into single digits this week, a government spokesman said. The south-east Asian nation reported seven new infections but no deaths on Thursday, taking its tally since the outbreak began in January to 2,954 cases, with the death toll staying at 54. Even after Sunday’s reopening, a nighttime curfew and ban on sales of alcohol will stay until the end of May unless otherwise specified, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin of the government’s centre for Covid-19 situation administration. Among the six categories set to reopen are small retailers, street food stalls and restaurants outside shopping malls, and parks and outdoor sports facilities, he told a news conference. But department stores, movie theatres, gyms and spas, as well as most indoor sports venues, will stay closed to ensure there are no large gatherings.

These include a ban on incoming international passenger flights, Taweesin said, as well as the alcohol ban ordered on 10 April. “Unless changes are announced, alcohol sales will not happen at this time,” Taweesin said. Now it will watch the situation for the next 14 days to decide whether to free up more businesses or clamp down again to contain the virus. Taweesin said: If the number of infections stays stable, we will ease restrictions further. But if the number rises to double or triple digits again, we will have to reassess everything.

A major survey conducted by King’s College London with Ipsos Mori showed that two in five people in the UK have reported sleep disturbance. Prof Bobby Duffy, the research lead and director of the Policy Institute at King’s, says: “There is a clear relationship between increased stress and impact on sleep; 53% of those who said they found the crisis stressful reported sleep difficulties.” But many people around the world are also experiencing a new phenomenon: pandemic dreams: Several researchers are collecting dream data during the pandemic, including Dr Deirdre Barrett, a clinical and evolutionary psychologist at Harvard Medical School. Some dreams she has collected during the current pandemic are literal – “people are having trouble breathing or spiking a fever” – but many are abstract. After all, we know coronavirus is there, but we can’t see it. “There are earthquakes, tidal waves and tornadoes; every kind of uncontrollable disaster. But the biggest dream cluster is bugs; flying bugs attacking the dreamer, cockroaches swarming, masses of squirming worms.” Many people around the world are also experiencing a new phenomenon: pandemic dreams.

Shops are open and families cycle along in the sunny spring weather in the Netherlands, which has opted for what it calls an “intelligent lockdown” to curb the coronavirus pandemic. In contrast to most other European countries, where people are virtually housebound, the Dutch authorities have merely advised people to stay home and to keep 1.5 metres (five feet) of social distance.

Schools meanwhile start to reopen from 11 May. The Netherlands has the 14th-highest number of confirmed infections worldwide, with 38,998, and 4,727 people have lost their lives in the country so far. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte - who came up with the phrase “intelligent lockdown” - has been clear on the policy. “We don’t work like that in the Netherlands, where the government says ‘you have to do this, you have to do that,” Rutte told a press conference at the end of March. The authorities have admonished the public when the country’s beaches have become too crowded, but while police have closed car parks to stop crowds flocking there at the weekends, they remain open. The Dutch position - very similar to Sweden’s - also reflects a wider philosophical split in both Europe and the world on how to balance the need to curb the disease against the catastrophic economic damage caused by harsh lockdowns. 6.33am BST Greta Thunberg donates $100,000 to support children during pandemic Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has donated a $100,000 prize she won from a Danish foundation to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) for use against the COVID-19 pandemic, the world body said Thursday. “Like the climate crisis, the coronavirus pandemic is a child rights crisis,” Thunberg, 17, was quoted as saying in the UNICEF statement. “It will affect all children, now and in the long term, but vulnerable groups will be impacted the most,” she added. “I’m asking everyone to step up and join me in support of UNICEF’s vital work to save children’s lives, to protect health and continue education.” Swedish environmentalist Greta Thunberg.

It will emerge over the coming weeks,” said Sir Peter Gluckman, who was the chief science advisor to New Zealand’s prime minister from 2009 until 2018. “With that will emerge some groups of people who will do well, they will find in the change opportunity, but many people who will be very uncertain, very scared, frustrated, angry, and we know from other disasters that about 10% or more even will progress to actual depression and to suicidality.” However Gluckman also said the country possessed unique assets that could see it navigate the coronavirus crisis better than other nations would.

Despite a record 52,000 tests being carried out on Wednesday, 19,000 were re-tests and hospital leaders criticised ministers for “a series of frequent tactical announcements” about testing targets. They said it was a “red herring” that had distracted from wider policy failures. Just days after Matt Hancock pledged to meet the 100,000 target by the end of April, the government turned down an offer of 10,000 testing kits a day from a US company.

Everyone I’ve photographed is helping out the NHS in one way or another, but I found community groups, or mutual aid networks, are much more active on the ground. I’m interested by the comparative effectiveness of the mutual aid structure v the lumbering official NHS volunteer scheme. Under that scheme, people are referred for help by their GPs. In some cases, volunteers have called the person “in need” and they have no idea why they are being contacted. Mutual aid networks, in comparison, work almost street by street, with most doors have had a flyer offering help pushed through the letterbox. These networks are also not hamstrung by concerns about data protection and privacy regulations or worries about insurance.

Most recently, a video of her face as the US president suggested injecting disinfectant into human beings might cure coronavirus went viral. As Trump spoke, Birx appeared to purse her lips and looked down, her hands clasped in her lap. Around her neck and shoulders was a silk scarf, loosely tied – almost in the style of a girl scout. The scarf was Hermès. Or, to be precise, Hermès’ “Retour à la Terre”, in peach. We know this because there is now an Instagram account devoted to Dr Birx’s scarves. She wears a different one almost every day, tied in a variety of styles, a move that has spawned her scarves their own online fanbase. 04.10.20 | Echo “Cherry Blossoms” Strangely, Dr Birx has not had much time to comment on the meaning behind her scarves. We know that one, an Afework Tekle art silk scarf from Ethiopia, was a gift from a colleague. Another, also Hermès, costs around US$700. Some, like one called Eagle and another called Daughters of the American Revolution, are patriotic. Then there’s the scarf featuring a cherry blossom motif, which may or may not be a reference to BrainDead, a TV show in which aliens living in Washington’s cherry trees take over the minds of politicians.

South Korea’s caseload has been slowing in recent weeks after it recorded hundreds of new cases every day between late February and early March. The government has subsequently relaxed some of its social distancing guidelines. It expected to ease up on more restrictions in coming days if its caseload maintains a decline. The health authorities also concluded no local transmission occurred from a parliamentary election this month, where authorities took safety measures, including requiring voters to wear masks and plastic gloves when casting ballots. “Twenty-nine million voters participated in the 15 April parliamentary election ...

Abe is expected to announce the extension after meeting experts on Friday, the Nikkei said, adding that he would take into account how the virus was spreading, whether people were reducing their contact with others, and the state of the country’s health services. While the number of daily cases in Tokyo appears to have stabilised since a peak of 201 on 17 April, a government official told the newspaper that the apparent slowdown in the capital and other areas did not warrant a relaxation of restrictions. “We will have a hard time lifting the state of emergency unless we can bring new infections down to 20 or 30 people,”the official said.

Police were called to a Brooklyn neighbourhood Wednesday after a funeral home overwhelmed by the coronavirus resorted to storing dozens of bodies on ice in rented trucks, and a passerby complained about the smell, officials said. Investigators who responded to a 911 call found that the home had rented four trucks to hold about 50 corpses, according to a law enforcement official. No criminal charges were brought and the official, who was not authorised to speak publicly about the investigation, spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

Workers suited up in protective gear could be seen in the afternoon transferring bodies into the refrigerated truck. New York City funeral homes have struggled as at least 18,000 people have died in the city since late March. The city set up temporary morgues.

Andrea Circle Bear, 30, had been sentenced to more than two years in prison on a drug charge this January. She delivered her baby by caesarean section while on a ventilator in a Texas hospital on 1 April, and died there on 28 April. Circle Bear’s child survived, but officials declined to provide any additional information on the baby’s condition or where the child is now, “out of respect for the family and for privacy reasons”, a Bureau of Prisons spokesman said. The 30-year-old woman “had a pre-existing medical condition” that made her more at risk for a severe case of coronavirus, according to federal officials, who did not specify what the condition was.

It’s going to be gone. It’s going to be eradicated,’ US president Donald Trump said of the coronavirus during a White House round table with business leaders. His comment comes as the number of Americans who have died of coronavirus passed 60,000. Trump was asked if he wanted the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to help fast track the use of a closely watched intravenous therapeutic drug, remdesivir, currently undergoing trials for treating Covid-19 patients. ‘We want everything to be safe, but we would like to see very quick approvals, especially with things that work,’ Trump said. The US’s top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has said that the antiviral drug remdesivir will become the standard of care for Covid-19 after early results showed it helped patients recover more quickly from the illness. 2.17am BST President Donald Trump also told Reuters on Wednesday he does not believe opinion polls that show his likely Democratic presidential opponent, Joe Biden, leading in the 2020 race for the White House. During an interview in the Oval Office, the Republican president said he did not expect the election to be a referendum on his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and added he was surprised the former vice president was doing well. “I don’t believe the polls,” Trump said. “I believe the people of this country are smart. And I don’t think that they will put a man in who’s incompetent.” In case you missed it: in the interview Trump also said that coronavirus has “upset very badly” the US trade deal with China, and that China “will do anything they can to have me lose in 2020.” Updated at 2.20am BST 2.03am BST Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. 1.53am BST Confirmed cases of coronavirus infection in Panama reached 6,378 on Wednesday, a rise of 178 from the previous day, and deaths climbed by two to 178, the health ministry said.

Remdesivir is one of the drugs under observation in many of those trials. So I think a lot more data will come out,” he said. Ryan added: “But we are hopeful this drug and others may prove to be helpful in treating Covid-19.” 12.20am BST In case you missed it, here is our full story on the nearly 100 cases of a rare ‘Covid-linked’ syndrome in children reported in at least six countries. The Guardian’s Ian Sample and Denis Campbell report: Doctors around the world have reported more cases of a rare but potentially lethal inflammatory syndrome in children that appears to be linked to coronavirus infections. Nearly 100 cases of the unusual illness have emerged in at least six countries, with doctors in Britain, the US, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland now reported to be investigating the condition. The first cases came to light this week when the NHS issued an alert to paediatricians about a number of children admitted to intensive care units with a mix of toxic shock and a condition known as Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory disorder that affects the blood vessel, heart and other organs. So far 19 children have been affected in the UK and none have died. The French health minister, Olivier Veran, said on Wednesday that the country had more than a dozen children with inflammation around the heart, and while there was insufficient evidence to prove a link with coronavirus, he said the cases were being taken “very seriously.” At least three children in the US aged six months to eight years are being treated for a similar condition.

Doctors around the world have reported more cases of a rare but potentially lethal inflammatory syndrome in children that appears to be linked to coronavirus infections. Nearly 100 cases of the unusual illness have emerged in at least six countries, with doctors in Britain, the US, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland now reported to be investigating the condition. This worrying news comes as the UK has included deaths outside hospital in its official figure for the first time, bringing the toll to 26,166: higher than France and Spain’s tolls. The official global death toll exceeded 225,000, according to Johns Hopkins University data, with the official toll at 226,771. At least 3,187,919 people have been infected worldwide. Donald Trump has said the federal government will not be extending its coronavirus social distancing guidelines once they expire on Thursday. Meanwhile, the number of Americans who have died of coronavirus surpassed 60,000, a toll far higher than any other country. US drug trial shows ‘clear cut’ effect, says top medic. While a Chinese trial demonstrated no “significant clinical benefits” to administering the antiviral drug remdesivir to Covid-19 patients, a separate trial in the US shows a “clear-cut” effect, according to the head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr Anthony Fauci.

Swiss government extends ban on large public events. The Swiss government has extended its ban on public events exceeding 1000 people until the end of August, even as it announced the easing of some other restrictions on sporting events, shops, restaurants and museums. Sweden passes 20,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus. The total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Sweden rose past the 20,000 mark on Wednesday, after the Nordic country reported another 681 infections. Five coronavirus cases have been reported in Aden, southern Yemen, by the country’s internationally recognised government, raising the prospect that the war-ravaged country will soon also have an outbreak of the new disease. China’s parliament is to hold its annual meeting from 22 May - more than two months later than planned. Conditions for holding the meeting have been met as the coronavirus situation has improved, decision makers said. Russia’s coronavirus case tally neared the 100,000 milestone, after the country reported 5,841 new cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, bringing its overall nationwide tally to 99,399, Reuters reports. UK government is still aiming for 100,000 daily tests by tomorrow, according to the environment secretary, George Eustice. He said the search for an effective antibody test was still under way and denied that earlier introduction of testing at care homes would have saved lives. The coronavirus outbreak needs to be contained before 2021 Olympics can go ahead, the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said. “The Olympic Games must be held in a way that shows the world has won its battle against the coronavirus pandemic.” The UK prime minister Boris Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds announced the birth of a baby boy. Johnson returned to frontline work on Monday after falling ill with coronavirus and spending time in intensive care. Air passenger numbers are down 99% in the UK, the home secretary told MPs, as she defended the government’s decision not to test individuals entering the country.

It’s an unexpected delight, however, to find somewhere like this one minute from the chaos and greasy pizza slice stores of Termini. Er Buchetto serves very few things and is smaller than my student bedroom was, but I’d consider a trip to Rome without lunch here a wasted journey. Normally hating pork, I was reluctant to follow a friend’s advice and try this porchetta bar, but went for a simple sandwich: porchetta, crusty bread. I ordered a glass of wine to go with it – altogether, under €5. Most people have had that meal that caused them to sit back, nod their head and silently think about how everything’s all right, really. This was mine. I finished my sandwich and immediately asked the owner for a second serving – this time, the full porchetta plate. He smiled and nodded – he’d definitely seen this happen before. • On Facebook prostak Small but perfect, Umbria A dish from Antiche Sere Osteria Enoteca, Bevagna Photograph: Antiche Sere Bevagna is a tiny village in Umbria, 25 minutes south of Assisi, Despite its compact size, there are more than a dozen restaurants housed within its medieval walls, the best of which is Antiche Sere Osteria Enoteca. It sits next to the Porta Garibaldi on the edge of the village with five or six tables outside and another four inside. One of the entrances leads you directly into the kitchen, which is smaller than you’d get in an average semi. Out of this walk-in wardrobe space, the chef serves up a range of regional dishes using the best of local ingredients – game and the ubiquitous truffle feature prominently. An antipasto of truffle omelette, followed by a main of pigeon, rabbit or guanciale (pig’s cheek) and ending with a chunk of the softest ricotta dripping with local honey is the perfect combination after a day in the Umbrian sun. The service, provided by a single waitress, is friendly and personal – when things get busy, the chef steps out of his alcove to take a few orders and suggest recommendations. Prices for starters peak at €10 with mains between €10 and €15. Perfetto. • On Facebook Addison DeWitt Vegetarian tasting menu, Liguria Trattoria La Brinca, Campo di Ne Photograph: Trattoria La Brinca An Italian Riviera holiday promises plenty of relaxation and seaside adventures, but those in search of authentic Ligurian cuisine should head away from the coast and up into the hills. After leaving the autostrada at Lavagna, a short scenic drive brings you to Campo di Ne and the charming Trattoria La Brinca. This family-run restaurant specialises in the foods and wine from the surrounding area, and both the meat and vegetarian tasting menus are good value and highly recommended (€50, including four wines). Specialities reflect the simple, peasant traditions typical of the area, such as fresh ravioli filled with herbs in a spicy meat sauce, chestnut flour panella (fritter) with wild fennel, and slow cooked or stuffed meats, including rabbit, veal and guinea fowl. Cheeses are from neighbouring farmers, and the desserts are designed to showcase seasonal fruits and berries, local hazelnuts and honey. Sergio Circella is a generous host who manages the front of house and the abundant wine cellar. His brother Roberto and wife Pierangela are the outstanding talent in the kitchen, with other family members serving guests in the dining room. Reservations required. • labrinca.it Servethepublic An oasis of local delights, Avellino Oasis Sapori Antichi, Vallesaccarda Photograph: Oasis Sapori Antichi Halfway across Italy and just off the Naples-Bari autostrada, the marvellous one-Michelin-star restaurant of Oasis Sapori Antichi in the remote but charming village of Vallesaccarda rewards the detour with superb dishes from the hills of Irpinia, an aptly named oasis of antique flavours. There are delicious and original specialities conjured with home-produced olive oil, soups, pasta and bread, such as an amazing ravioli with burnt garlic and walnut filling, with seasonal variations bringing truffles, mushrooms, baccalà (battered salt cod) and locally sourced meats including rabbit and boar, rich cheeses and expertly chosen wines. That’s not to mention starters with miraculous hams and mozzarella and homemade ice creams among the desserts, all served with impeccably warm family hospitality and exquisite taste at very reasonable prices. • oasis-saporiantichi.it dorisyeltsin Baccalà and nothing but, Rome Dar Filettaro, Rome Photograph: Dar filettaro a Santa Barbara The time-warped sign on the facade says FILETTI DI BACCALÀ, and that pretty much says it all. Tucked into a piazza in front of Santa Barbara church, Dar Filettaro is a Roman legend. Locals queue for a seat at the outdoor trestles or in the no-frills dining room, where the tablecloths are paper and the service is efficient bordering on brusque. Choose (quickly, they need your table) from a spartan menu of baccalà – battered salt cod – and a few accompaniments: chicory shoots, anchovies, bruschetta, beans and draught beer.

Embedded in the fishing community just off the the remote yet angelic coast of the Nervi district of Genoa, this Italian restaurant ticks all the right boxes. Famous for its pizza and kebabs, the internal decor features some of Naples’s most famous faces, including a certain eccentric footballer. Naples is famed for its beautiful, chaotic ambiance, so in a northern Italy city that holds a close bond with its southern counterpart, a beautiful balance is struck. One can dine here well for around €20. The staff are serious about their food and there is plenty of great beer and wine to accompany the best pizza in Genoa/Naples. • On Facebook Jason O’Callaghan Meltingly good meats and polenta, Lake Como Osteria Il Pozzo, Menaggio.

Head to the Osteria Il Pozzo in Menaggio for some cheap cucina povera of princely pedigree. There really are only two dishes to be eaten here: the osso buco (veal shank) and the rabbit. At all costs avoid the tired and grey vegetable sides and go guiltlessly for the cheese and butter-rich polenta taragna, an extraordinary puddle of joy studded with gritty little buckwheat husks, which hails from the beauteous mountains of nearby Valtellina. The lunch service begins at midday so arrive early to avoid the queues. After your postprandial nap, head back out to the esplanade, grab a gelato from Il Gabbiano (the best in Menaggio) and on to the Conad supermarket on Via Marconi. Enjoy a humble plastic cup of nebbiolo (red wine) on the rickety pier behind the ungainly Camping Europa. Why? Far from the crowd, the mountains at sunset and the expletive serenade of the Menaggini fishermen is a rare and unmissable thing. • On Facebook Alex Witt Perfect pizza, Naples L’Antica Pizzeria da Michele, Naples Photograph: L’Antica Pizzeria da Michele L’Antica Pizzeria da Michele only serves two options: margherita pizza or marinara pizza, but don’t let that put you off. This thin, authentic raised-crust Neapolitan pizza is perfect in its simplicity. The lightly bubbled dough, fresh tangy sauce from locally grown tomatoes and rich mozzarella make for a memorable experience that soars above much more expensive and complex dining affairs I tried in Naples. It gets very busy, especially after featuring in Eat Pray Love (Julia Roberts’ character enjoyed the pizza as much as I did, apparently). The pizza costs only €4 and the drinks, including a good light beer, are also reasonably priced. • damichele.net Julia O’Connor The locals’ trattoria, Rome A dish from Trattoria Da Simonetta, Rome Photograph: Trattoria Da Simonetta I was recommended family-run trattoria Trattoria Da Simonetta, tucked away in a small suburb of Rome near San Giovanni Basilica, by our elderly B&B owner. It’s not much to look at from the street, but inside it offers all the charms of Italy without the gimmicks – pizza ovens, pasta kneaded in the open kitchen, red-and-white-chequered table cloths and baskets of fresh bread. The English-speaking owners easily translated the all-Italian menu and offered recommendations of their own. It was full of locals, which might be why prices were cheaper than any others I encountered in Rome, with one-litre carafes of wine for just €8 and pizzas and pastas for about the same. • On Facebook livvilee Food with a view, Tuscany La Grotta Trattoria, La Sassa Photograph: Antica trattoria La Grotta La Grotta Trattoria is a restaurant cut out of the rock in a tiny hilltop village called La Sassa in Tuscany. The nearest town is Volterra but it’s not very near. If you have a car or a motorbike, though, La Grotta is about 30 minutes drive from the campsites along the coast south of Livorno. There’s no menu; the food consists of antipasta, three pasta courses (at least one of which will involve wild boar), a main of wild boar and wood pigeon and the dessert of the day, often semi-freddo. I don’t remember a wine list – we just drank the excellent red they brought to the table. I’ve eaten there several times and each time was wonderful. At the end of an evening meal, you emerge to the most magical view out over the Tuscan hills.

We have been taking extraordinary precautions around the world to keep our plant environments safe and recent developments in North America make it clear this is the right thing to do now,” GM boss Mary Barra Updated at 6.01pm GMT 5.38pm GMT Trump gains wiped out Remember this? NASDAQ UP 72.2% SINCE OUR GREAT 2016 ELECTION VICTORY! DOW UP 55.8%. The best is yet to come! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2019 Presidents usually avoid boasting about the stock market, aware that today’s gains can be wiped out by tomorrow’s events. It’s a lesson Trump is learning the hard way. Covid-19 has now erased all the stock market gains of the Trump presidency. After his last speech, markets fell so hard they were temporarily stopped. Now they are open again and still falling. The Dow is now down 9%. Updated at 5.54pm GMT 5.21pm GMT Up and falling Trading has resumed and the falls continue. Some are blaming it on Trump. Here’s Dan Alpert, investment banker and credit bubble expert: And that's it. @realDonaldTrump literally succeeded in tanking the market - shutting it down as it hits it circuit breaker limit loss. He actually did it...the very stable genius! https://t.co/VI2kColI1Z — Dan Alpert (@DanielAlpert) March 18, 2020 5.05pm GMT Markets closed down - again Trading has stopped again after the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,660 points, or 7.8%, and the S&P 500 dropped over 7%. The indexes are down about 30% from their mid-February highs. Everything is falling today. Oil has plunged 15% to its lowest level in more than 18 years. Gold, usually a safe haven in times of panic, is down 1%. Looks like people want to cash out - they want to take their money and head for the hills until this blows over. Updated at 5.09pm GMT 4.59pm GMT “Shut it down now!” Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman is going off on CNBC. He sounds almost on the edge of tears. Says he has been in isolation recently because of fears he could carry the virus and pass it to older, vulnerable people including his dad. Ackman says he has never carried more than $200 in cash but went to the bank recently and took out “a large amount of money”. “Capitalism does not work in an 18 month shutdown,” he says. The Trump administration needs to close everything down in order to get rid of the virus as quickly as possible. “This is the only answer.” If we don’t jump on this now “America as we know it will end”. Mr. President, the moment you send everyone home for Spring Break and close the borders, the infection rate will plummet, the stock market will soar, and the clouds will lift. We need your leadership now! — Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) March 18, 2020 4.43pm GMT CEOs tell Trump to 'act boldly' America’s biggest companies are weighing in - calling on Congress to “act boldly” to limit the economic fallout from the pandemic. The Business Roundtable, which speaks for dozens of major US companies including Apple, General Motors, JP Morgan Chase and WalMart, wants a suspension of global tariffs, a temporary halt to payrolls taxes and measures to support the supply chain. The government actions necessary to address this crisis will have enormous costs,” the letter, signed by Walmart boss Doug McMillon, said. “However, failure to act boldly now will impose far greater costs to our country and our future.” Updated at 5.52pm GMT 4.27pm GMT European markets close down - US markets are still falling European markets are now closed after another bad day. In London the FTSE 100 fell over 4%, in Frankfurt the Dax dropped over 5% per cent and in Paris the Cac 40 was down by a similar margin.

The act gives the president more control of the US supply chain. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) the act “is the primary source of Presidential authorities to expedite and expand the supply of resources from the US industrial base to support military, energy, space, and homeland security programs.” The act authorizes the president to: require businesses to sign contracts or fulfill orders deemed necessary for national defense; allocate materials, services and facilities to national defense; and gives him greater control over scarce and/or critical materials. The act became law on September 8, 1950, in response to the start of the Korean War. 3.59pm GMT Trump speaks We are waiting for Trump to speak. The White House is asking Congress for $500bn that would pay for two emergency payments to US taxpayers. According to the New York Times, which has seen a draft of the proposal: The Treasury Department proposal calls for the authority to send two $250 billion rounds of checks directly to American taxpayers, the first on April 6 and the second May 18. Payments would be fixed, and their size dependent on income and family size, the summary said. 3.45pm GMT Job losses All these stock market falls can seem a bit abstract but we will soon see if they are making their way into the real economy. The US labor department releases its national weekly unemployment claims figures at 8:30am. During this unprecedented period of jobs growth the figures haven’t attracted much attention. Tomorrow will be different. This week Connecticut’s Hartford Courant reported the state is already witnessing a huge spike in claims. Recently the state has been getting 3,000 to 3,500 claims a week as people lose their jobs. Some 10,000 claims were filed Monday and nearly 12,000 more came on Tuesday, bringing the number to 30,000 since Friday. “I’ve never seen anything like this,’ deputy commissioner Daryle Dudzinski, who has been at the Labor Department since 1992, told the Courant. “It’s unbelievable.” 3.25pm GMT Dow drops below 20,000 The sell off is picking up on Wall Street. The Dow has now dropped below 20,000 and has lost some 1,400 points. This despite a promised $1tn US aid package. Traders have been saying for days that the only news likely to break this cycle is good news on the virus, falling infection rates or a medical breakthrough. Otherwise it looks like we are in for more turbulent days ahead. WATCH: The Dow is down more than 1,200 points, hovering around the 20,000 mark. https://t.co/QnNVMpVPjP — CNBC (@CNBC) March 18, 2020 3.17pm GMT Fiat Chrysler is closing an assembly plant in Michigan after an employee tested positive for the new coronavirus. Production at its pickup truck plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan is now on hold as the company makes plans to resume work under new guidelines reached with the United Auto Workers. 2.54pm GMT Trades unions are urging the government to provide wage subsidies to protect jobs. The TUC is also concerned that firms could take official help, and then cut jobs. Support for firms must be come with requirements to protect jobs and wages, it insists. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The Chancellor’s announcements so far will help protect businesses. But he must now urgently step up the protections that workers need too. Many other counties are using government wage subsidies to stop job losses and keep up economic activity. We need it too. And government support to businesses must be conditional on them producing a plan to protect jobs and wages. 2.49pm GMT Ryanair has announced it will ground “most if not all” flights after next Tuesday. It currently expects to run a “very small number of flights for essential connectivity”, mainly between the UK and Ireland. More than 80% of flights still scheduled until then will be grounded immediately. It said call centres were overloaded and asked customers not to call, and await email instructions. It may operate some “rescue flights” from the EU, it said, where possible. 2.29pm GMT Deutsche: Prepare for worst slowdown since World War 2 More gloom! Deutsche Bank has forecast a severe global recession will occur in the first half of 2020. In a new report, it says aggregate demand has plunged in China in the current quarter, and will plunge in Europe and the US in April-June. They warn: The quarterly declines in GDP growth we anticipate substantially exceed anything previously recorded going back to at least World War II. But... they also predict that governments will fight back: The fiscal response could turn out to be huge, with serious discussion in the US of stimulus packages amounting to 6% of GDP on top of already significant automatic stabilizers. In Europe, the fiscal rules have been effectively suspended and leaders pledge to spend “whatever it takes”. So, their new forecasts show a precipitous slump in growth, but then a recovery: Deutsche Bank economic forecasts Photograph: Deutsche Bank 2.24pm GMT ILO: 25 million jobs could be lost Here’s a chilling forecast -- 25 million jobs could be lost worldwide due to the Covid-19 crisis. That’s according to the International Labour Organization (ILO), who fear the impact will be even worse than the 2008 financial crisis. But the impact could be lower-- if policymakers take decisive steps. In its “low” scenario, the ILO estimates global unemployment would rise by 5.3m. But the “high” scenario shows it jumping by 24.7m worldwide, from 188m last year. By comparison, the 2008-9 global financial crisis increased global unemployment by 22 million. That ‘low’ scenario is based on governments protecting workers in the workplace, stimulating the economy and employment, and supporting jobs and incomes. ILO Director-General Guy Ryder says: This is no longer only a global health crisis, it is also a major labour market and economic crisis that is having a huge impact on people. In 2008, the world presented a united front to address the consequences of the global financial crisis, and the worst was averted. We need that kind of leadership and resolve now. 2.04pm GMT The usual suspects are dragging the Dow Jones down today. Boeing has lost another 16%, American Express are down 10% and Home Depot have lost 9%, reflecting the slump in travel and consumer spending. Pharmacy firm Walgreens Boots are up 4%, though, with Walmart up 3.7% and Procter & Gamble 1.2% higher. 1.58pm GMT With the US Federal Reserve running low on options, the responsibility for saving the US economy now lies with Donald Trump’s White House. And that’s terrifying, given the president’s past form, writes our business editor Dominic Rushe: The Trump administration is talking bailouts already for the airlines, hotels and others. What he can pass remains to be seen. Trump has no friends on the other side of the House and slim chance of making any. Even if he can get something approved, how effective will it be? The omens are ominous. If you want to imagine what a Trump bailout will look like, look no further than his 2017 tax cuts. “The rich will not be gaining at all with this plan,” Trump promised as he pushed through the $1.7tn cuts that the, then booming, US economy neither needed and which the future could ill afford. The tax cuts were sold on a lie. “Our focus is on helping the folks who work in the mailrooms and the machine shops of America. The plumbers, the carpenters, the cops, the teachers, the truck drivers, the pipe-fitters, the people that like me best,” promised Trump. In fact, more than 60% of the tax savings went to the most wealthy 20%, according to the non-partisan Tax Policy Center. Quite a number of them were in Congress. More here: Related: The Federal Reserve can't save us. Can Trump fix the impending global recession? 1.53pm GMT Wall Street is alarmed by reports that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin fears the coronavirus pandemic could drive up US unemployment to 20%, without decisive action. Mnuchin made the comments to Republican senators on Tuesday, apparently, as he urged them to back a massive stimulus rescue package. The Treasury downplayed the report, saying: Secretary Mnuchin used several mathematical examples for illustrative purposes, but he never implied this would be the case. But it’s reminded investors just how bad the downturn could be..... 1.46pm GMT Wall Street slumps at the open Not even the prospect of a $1.2 trillion stimulus package could prevent the New York stock market from sliding. Wall Street slumped roughly 5% as soon as the opening bell rang, wiping out most of yesterday’s rally. Dow: down 1,267 points or 6% at 19,970 points S&P 500: down 132 points or 5.24% at 2,396 points Nasdaq: down 304 points of 4% at 7,030.21 points 1.40pm GMT BoE governor: Stop shorting UK assets BoE governor Andrew Bailey has also fired two warning shots at the City -- don’t pay large bonuses and dividends if you take official help, and don’t you dare short UK assets during this crisis. He’s told the BBC that firms should also hold off from laying off staff, before checking if the government can help.

It’s not always malicious - a fund could short one retailer, for example, and buy shares in another whose prospects look brighter. 1.33pm GMT Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has also declared that all reasonable options are on the table to tackle the crisis. Speaking to Sky News, after warning Britain faces an economic emergency, Bailey didn’t rule out the idea of handing cash straight to people (helicopter money, in the jargon).

It is urging the Government to announce an employment support plan immediately, to help protect livelihoods. Otherwise, jobs will be cut, starting today. Kate Nicholls, CEO of UKHospitality said: “Our analysis suggests in excess of one million jobs are now on the line. Job cuts are extraordinarily deep and they are happening now – today and tomorrow, and are snowballing. Companies are having to make the very difficult decisions now and with many hospitality and leisure businesses now having to choose to close or massively reduce their operations, there is little chance of saving many jobs without far-reaching help. What the sector urgently needs is a package of support and funding to keep people in employment. This needs to happen now – within 24 hours. 1.04pm GMT Britain faces economic emergency, warns new Bank of England governor NEWSFLASH: The UK’s new top central banker has warned that Britain faces a national emergency (just three days into his new job). Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: Andrew Bailey, the new governor of the Bank of England, has warned that Britain faces an economic emergency and that further measures will be needed to prevent widespread disruption turning into destruction. Speaking in a conference call from a virtually deserted Threadneedle Street, Bailey said events had moved on rapidly in the week since the Bank cut interest rates and eased capital requirements on banks as part of a co-ordinated stimulus with Rishi Sunak’s budget. “Those were big steps we and the government took a week ago. They were the right steps”, Bailey said. “It is unquestionable, though, that things have moved on a lot in the ensuing period” Bailey, who took over from Mark Carney at the start of the week, said one big and worrying development was the impact of the coronavirus crisis on large companies as well as the small and medium-sized businesses that were the focus of the joint Bank-Treasury action a week ago.

Another morning of heavy selling has driven the UK’s FTSE 100 index down by 4.5% to 5,043, close to Monday’s eight-year low. Aerospace and defence firm Meggitt are currently the top fallers, down 20%, followed by online estate agent Rightmove (-16%) and equipment rental firm Ashtead (-16%). Supermarket chains are sharply higher, though, as they struggle to meet huge demand from stock-piling customers. Sainsbury and Morrisons are both up 11%. Other European markets are also being badly hit by fears of a deep global recession - with the Stoxx 600 index down nearly 5%. The pound has slumped, dropping below $1.20 and hitting lows last regularly seen in the 1980s as investors scramble to get their hands on dollars. *BRITISH POUND SINKS TO LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 1985 AGAINST DOLLAR — lemasabachthani (@lemasabachthani) March 18, 2020 Oil is tumbling too, with US crude prices hitting a 17-year low below $25 per barrel.

Italian government debt is under particular pressure. The European Central Bank has insisted that it has more firepower to hand, to fight the crisis. The UK government has indicated it will do more to help workers, and those who rent, after announcing a £350bn package of support last night. But the cost of the crisis is mounting. UBS reckon the Chinese economy may shrink at an annualised rate of 30% in the current quarter - an unheard of slump. City economists predict the UK could contract by up to 15% in April-June, given the shutdown across the economy. The big fear haunting the markets is the uncertainty of how long this crisis will rage for. Oxford Economics say: In our coronavirus pandemic scenario, global growth grinds to a halt in Q2 2020 as the world economy succumbs to recession, but it then rebounds to a rapid 5% pace of expansion within a year. With much of the initial output loss recovered in a relatively short period of time, long-term impacts are limited. But there are risks to this view. The period of disruption could be longer than anticipated, depending on the potential spread and seasonality of COVID-19 and policy actions to mitigate the fallout. Opinion polls also highlight the potential risk of larger, more persistent effects for some countries. In other developments: UK car factories are freezing production.

It’s not just because the dollar is in massive demand. He writes: Sterling has completed one of its steepest declines in memory by hitting its weakest level since 1985, excluding if you will the brief dive of the Oct 2016 ‘flash crash’. This is the worst sustained period of sterling selling that I can recall, and it points to a severe dollar liquidity crunch that central banks have yet to get a grip on. There is a synchronised rush for dollars that has caught most companies, governments and traders on the hop. Dollar funding issues have been far more serious than estimated prior to this crisis. However sterling is also sharply weaker against the euro in recent days, with EURGBP above 0.92, so whilst the main reason for the pound’s decline, there are clearly other factors at work. The UK government’s massive fiscal package undoubtedly means more borrowing for the UK economy - how do we pay for all this? And in a rather bizarre turn of events - if you have been schooled in the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis a few years back - the euro has developed certain safe haven characteristics. Sterling is, on the other hand, a bit of a proxy for risk. The pound vs the US dollar this year Photograph: Refinitiv 12.04pm GMT A growing number of European carmakers are downing tools, my colleague Rob Davies reports: BMW and Toyota have joined a rapidly lengthening list of carmakers shutting down European operations, affecting UK plants in Oxfordshire and Derbyshire, as the coronavirus brings the automotive industry grinding to a virtual halt. More than 10,000 car workers have been laid off across the industry as Nissan, the Mercedes-Benz parent, Daimler, Volkswagen, Ford, Fiat and Peugeot have already announced suspensions of their European output. Jaguar Land Rover kept its UK sites operating but has frozen output at its Slovak factory. Germany’s BMW and the Japanese auto giant Toyota followed suit on Wednesday, extending the roster of factories that would normally make millions of cars every year but are on pause for the time being.

The pound is now worth €1.082, down from €1.095 last night, meaning one euro is worth 92.3p - the weakest since August 2019. 11.36am GMT Investment firm Aviva has suspended trading in its UK property fund saying that the the coronavirus has made it impossible to correctly value the assets that it holds. The £461m fund is the third to be closed since the economic impact of the pandemic started to be felt in the UK. The fund, which invests in a range of commercial properties including offices, high street shops and leisure facilities, is regularly valued by an independent company and the price of buying shares in it is determined by that valuation’. Aviva said that it had been advised that there was currently too much uncertainty in its valuation, and that there was a risk that investors could buy or sell shares at a cost that did not reflect their true worth. 11.35am GMT Pound 'overwhelmed' by coronavirus Sterling is continuing to slump - it’s now down almost 1.5 cents today at $1.191. That’s the lowest since the post-Brexit vote flash crash in late 2016 - but really, we’re looking at the lowest point against the dollar in decades. As the Financial Times puts it: The UK currency has not consistently traded under $1.20 since the 1980s..... “Everyone thought that Brexit was the big deal for sterling this year but …the currency has been completely overwhelmed by the coronavirus,” said Richard Benson, co-chief investment officer at Millennium Global Investments in London. 11.16am GMT European markets are looking even messier, with the FTSE 100 now down almost 290 points or 5% at 5007 after three hour’s trading. That would be a new eight-year closing low if trading ended now. The German and French markets are also off 5%, as fears of a very deep eurozone recession grow. Deutsche Bank seeing Q2 annualised contractions of 13% in US and 24% in Euro area — Michael Hewson \uD83C\uDDEC\uD83C\uDDE7 (@mhewson_CMC) March 18, 2020 11.10am GMT Pound falls below $1.20 The pound has sunk below $1.20 against the US dollar, for the first time since last September. Its currently down three-quarters of a cent today, at $1.1975. Sterling has slumped since the coronavirus crisis began - it was trading over $1.30 in February, but is now heading towards levels last seen in the 2016 flash crash. The pound vs the US dollar Photograph: Refinitiv If you ignore that flash crash, the pound is approaching levels seen in the 1980s, against the dollar. But its partly because investors are piling into the dollar. Against the euro, the pound is at its lowest since last August. 10.52am GMT Government bonds join the selloff Government bond prices are weakening today, as investors sell up. This is pushing the yield on UK, US, German and other European government debt up from their recent record lows - a sign that prices are dropping from their peaks. Italy is not alone, although its moves are more dramatic (see earlier post). One reason is that the huge stimulus packages being drawn up to fight the Covid-19 crisis will need paying for, with an avalanche of debt. But it also suggests that investors are selling their safe-haven assets, perhaps to cover other losses or to satisfy redemption requests. The FT has a good take: Bond yields in the US and Europe rose to their highest levels in weeks as fund managers under pressure to return cash to investors were forced to dump their most liquid holdings, according to traders. Yields move in the opposite direction to prices. “This is fire-selling of liquid assets by those who need to meet redemptions,” said Mike Riddell, a portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors. “A lot of people need cash and they’re liquidating the only thing that they can. 10.44am GMT UBS slash Chinese growth forecasts UBS has slashed its forecast for China’s economic growth - warning that it could contract at an annual rate of 30% this quarter. That’s because the mobility restrictions imposed to contain the virus have had a chilling impact on the economy, while also curbing infections. UBS write: Only 0.005% of China’s population is confirmed to be infected but, because of the near complete halt in activity for 4-6 weeks, we now expect Q1 growth to fall -31% QoQ annualized, and full year growth to come in as low as 1%YoY. That revision moves our 2020 global growth forecast from 2.4% to 1.5%YoY, halfway towards our worst-case scenario. And many countries are now following China’s example. So with “broad-based service sector shutdowns in many countries”, the impact on global growth will be worse then feared, they add. 10.31am GMT ECB: We aren't out of ammunition Gosh! The European Central Bank has slapped down one of its own governing council members, Austria’s top central banker, after he suggested monetary policy was running low on gas. In an interview with Austria’s Der Standard, Robert Holzmann suggested the ECB was at its limits and markets were expecting too much from policymakers. Asked about the slump in shares and Italian bonds following last week’s ECB meeting, Holzmann said: We cannot solve the problem on our own, it is now primarily a matter of fiscal policy. It is the state’s responsibility to provide liability and social support. Monetary policy cannot cover up the problem. Holzmann also suggested the crisis could have a ‘cleansing’ impact, clearing out failing companies and making the economy (eventually) stronger: This has prompted a rare public rebuttal from the ECB, which says: With regards to comments made by Governor Holzmann, the ECB states: The Governing Council was unanimous in its analysis that in addition to the measures it decided on 12 March 2020, the ECB will continue to monitor closely the consequences for the economy of the spreading coronavirus and that the ECB stands ready to adjust all of its measures, as appropriate, should this be needed to safeguard liquidity conditions in the banking system and to ensure the smooth transmission of its monetary policy in all jurisdictions. We're at the \"central bankers telling other central bankers to shut the hell up\" stage of the crisis — Duncan Robinson (@duncanrobinson) March 18, 2020 10.07am GMT What more could the UK government do to help companies? One idea, being pushed by business groups, is to reverse the national insurance scheme - to inject cash back into struggling firms. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, which represents some of the country’s biggest employers, believes it could have an immediate impact. “This is about using existing systems, it’s all about speed,” Fairbairn told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “So the thought that we have put to the chancellor is to reverse national insurance contributions, not just defer or cancel them, but actually get the flow working in the other direction.” Fairbairn said that Germany is using a similar system, which is already up and running. The CBI proposal makes sense - reverse the National Insurance system to support wages. Do this for firms that can demonstrate a precipitate fall in turnover in the last few weeks. Enlist the aid of the accountancy profession to assess this so that decisions can be made quickly. — David N.F.

Sebastian James, the chief executive of Boots, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that products including hand sanitiser, paracetamol, pain relief, baby products and cleaning products should be flowing more freely. “504 lines are very much in demand at the moment in our stores, we are are getting more every day, it’s a little and often, we ship to our stores every single day, sometimes twice a day.” James said Boots, which has around 2,400 shops in the UK, was asking shoppers to buy only what they needed for their family, to make sure products were available for others. 9.43am GMT Italian government bonds are coming under real pressure today. The yield, or interest rates, on 10-year Italian debt has jumped over 3%, for the first time since the end of 2018. That widens the gap with German debt - a sign that traders are getting worried. Of course, Italy may need to issue a lot more government debt to finance the cost of its coronavirus response. That would typically push down prices, and push up yields (As Rome would need to offer a better interest rate to encourage demand). But the scale and speed of the moves are rather concerning. The old eurozone debt crisis problems are resurfacing. BTP out of control. Need a circuit-breaker. pic.twitter.com/IhFMduXqj4 — Frederik Ducrozet (@fwred) March 18, 2020 Yesterday, Italian PM Giuseppe Conte called for special “coronavirus bonds” or a European guarantee fund to help member states finance urgent health and economic policies. German chancellor Angela Merkel didn’t not rule it out, saying no decision had been made - but it’s not clear that Berlin has dropped its long opposition to shared borrowing. 9.33am GMT European markets fall as investors anticipate long-term damage After 90 minutes trading, European stocks are sagging. The FTSE 100 index is now down 4.5%, as the latest stimulus packages announced by world leaders fail to reassure the markets. Michael Strobaek, chief investment officer at Credit Suisse, suggests investors should keep to the sidelines, saying (via the FT): “The jury is still out on whether these measures will help stabilise financial markets.” Investors are also aware that this isn’t a repeat of 2008. It’s actually the reverse - the real economy is hurting the financial sector, not the other way round. As Kit Juckes of Société Générale wisely explains: 2008 was a crisis born in shadow banking that exposed how over-leveraged the financial sector had become and for many banks, including large ones, over-dependence on short-term funding was a major weakness which, in turn, caused liquidity to dry up. The banks were in the front line of the crisis. This time (economic) front line in the crisis, is the damage the pandemic is wreaking on companies in exposed sectors and on the economy more widely as the crisis spreads. So while market participants scramble de-leverage, the banks need money to lend to companies whose cashflow situation has changed almost overnight. That need for funds to flow into the economy isn’t going away any time soon. The result is that while direct financial effects of this crisis might be less acute than in 08, they will continue being felt for a long time. 9.26am GMT Over in Lisbon, the Portuguese government has announced a €9.2bn coronavirus economic package. It includes €3bn of government-backed credit guarantees, €1bn for social security payments, and a €5.2bn fiscal stimulus, Reuters reports. 9.18am GMT UK: We will do more.... As markets shrug at yesterday’s £350bn economic rescue plan, the UK government has suggested it could take further action - which could include more help for employees Speaking on the Today programme, business secretary Alok Sharma said the proposals put forward by the chancellor had been well-received by groups including the CBI, but confirmed that more action would be needed. “I completely understand that people want us to go further, particularly on this issue of support for employees, for employment... The chancellor was very clear that this is a conversation he and I are having with employers and trade unions, and we’ll come forward in the coming days with further measures.” While not ruling out direct payments to workers, Sharma said that the government was “looking at using the current system and how we can get that support very quickly into businesses.” He said: “The principle is that yes we will get support to businesses for employees measures specifically”. Asked if businesses could be relied on to pass money from grants and loans onto employees, rather than prioritising creditors or other payments he said: “The vast amount of businesses want to operate, they will behave sensibly, but I completely get this point about measures specifically for employees and employment and we will come forward with those.” Sharma ducked a question about whether he would be able to live on the £94.22 a week available as statutory sick pay to those who are unable to work, saying instead that 30% of employers paid more, and workers might also be entitled to other benefits. 9.12am GMT Selfridges in London yesterday Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA The coronavirus crisis has forced Selfridges,the high-end department chain, to shut its stores in London, Manchester and Birmingham will close from 7pm tonight. Selfridges flagship store on Oxford Street is one of the capital’s landmark retail sites, so this shows the scale of the retail downturn. My colleague Zoe Wood suspects other will soon follow.... How soon before other department store stores follow Selfridges lead? High fixed costs and presumably no shoppers. https://t.co/tUjUqYBhnC — Zoe Wood (@zoewoodguardian) March 18, 2020 9.00am GMT Investment bank Jefferies has welcomed Rishi Sunak’s £330bn stimulus package, saying it will help the UK economy recover. The next few months will be grim - GDP could fall by up to 15% in April-June. They told clients: Such quarterly declines in GDP are unprecedented, certainly in living memory, and will lead to further corporate failures and economic hardship. However, today’s announcements should be seen as further important steps to help address the substantial economic costs of effectively shutting down economies, and a further move towards substantial fiscal easing and rising government debt across many economies. But Jefferies does still expect “a significant bounce-back in activity”, eventually, as this chart shows: 8.56am GMT The smaller FTSE 250 index is having a rough morning, again, down another 3.6%. Transport groups National Express and Go-Ahead Group have both tumbled 20%, as commuters continue to shun services and work from home. IWG, which provides serviced offices, are down 17% at 121p (from 440p a month ago). Demand for its business centres will be hurt badly, the longer workers self-isolate. 8.44am GMT Oil slumps to lowest since 2003 Fears of a deep global recession are driving the oil price down again today. US crude has dropped nearly 4% to $25.83 per barrel, which looks to be the lowest since 2003. Oil prices have collapsed this year (from over $60 in January), as traders anticipate a global downturn. Saudi Arabia is pressing on with its price war too, by boosting crude output even though demand is falling. #WTI just dropped to its lowest since 2003. Mind-boggling to see oil trading at these prices. #OOTT #ONGT pic.twitter.com/lsRfIdRGwz — Jessica Jaganathan (@j3ssi3) March 18, 2020 Brent crude has dropped to $28.25 per barrel (last seen in 2016, I think). 8.35am GMT European stock markets are also under pressure, with the Stoxx 600 index down 3.3% and Germany’s DAX has dropped 4.7%. That’s a disappointment for investors, who saw stocks jump yesterday. But in the current climate, a 4% slide is quite gentle! Neil Wilson of Markets.com says The fact that markets keep shrugging off the stimulus measures reflects the deep uncertainty about the economic damage about to be done. But these moves are not the 7,8,9,10% type swings. This is better - smaller daily swings are the first step to stabilisation before we can start to look at the bottom being in. For now every rally is sold into, every financial relief effort is an opportunity to get out from positions long held. The market is behaving extremely short-term in its outlook, whilst the long-term effects are entirely unclear. The Vix remains elevated at 75, though somewhat off its highs around 85 after Wall St bounced yesterday. 8.24am GMT Here are the top risers and fallers on the FTSE 100 this morning. 8.21am GMT FTSE 100 falls, but supermarkets surge Britain’s stock market has opened in the red, as the government’s £330bn Covid-19 rescue plan fails to calm nerves in the City. The FTSE 100 has dropped by 180 points, or 3.3%, to 5123 - wiping out Monday’s rally. Jet engine maker Rolls-Royce is leading the slump, tumbling by 18% to 312p. JP Morgan slashes its target on the stock this morning, from 350p to 250p. With airlines grounding planes, and many expected to fail, demand for new engines - and lucrative servicing contracts on existing ones - is going to be hit. International equipment rental company Ashtead is down 13% But supermarket chains are surging, after Morrisons (+12%) posted its 5% jump in sales this morning. J Sainsbury are up 11%, with online grocer Ocado 5% up. Updated at 8.32am GMT 8.15am GMT UK supermarket Morrisons has reported a jump in sales - thanks to UK shoppers desperately stockpiling. But it’s not celebrating - instead, the group says it faces “unprecedented challenges and uncertainty” dealing with coronavirus. For the first six weeks of its 2020-21 year, retail like-for-like sales were up 5.0% at Morrisons - who yesterday announced it would hire 3,500 people to handle the rush. It says: “Looking after our colleagues and customers is our priority, ensuring that we have a clean, safe place to shop and work.” 8.12am GMT British fashion brand Superdry has warned it will miss its financial targets for this year. It says 78 stores are now shut across Europe, and customer numbers are falling in the US and UK. This means it won’t meet forecasts given in early January for 2020. 8.08am GMT Restaurant Group: sales are plunging Restaurant Group, which runs the Wagamama, Frankie & Benny’s and Chiquito chains, has told the City its trading has tumbled in the last fortnight. It says: Group like-for-like sales for the first eight weeks of the financial year were up 4.5%, in a period unaffected by Covid-19. In the last two weeks we have seen an increasing and material impact of Covid-19 across our businesses with Group like-for-like sales being down 12.5%. In particular, our Concessions business has been significantly impacted with like-for-like sales down 21.7% and getting worse by the day given International travel bans. Restaurant Group’s business plan is now based on group sales almost halving in the first six months of 2020, and by another 5% in H2. It is planning to cut capital expenditure this year by at least £45m from the previous guidance of £75m, and is seeking ‘covenant’ holidays from its banks (the relaxation of the terms on its loans). But it insists it can ride out the crisis, saying: The Restaurant Group is fundamentally a resilient business with a strong asset base, substantial cash liquidity and strong cash flow 7.57am GMT Pub chains warn of Covid-19 pain A pub on Carnaby Street, London, last night Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters A flurry of UK companies are warning that the coronavirus crisis is damaging their businesses. Let’s do the pubs first. Mitchells & Butlers, which runs the All Bar One and O’Neills chains, says it is still open for business - but suffering a slump in sales. So it can’t forecast its financial performance for 2020. For the first 24 weeks of the year, up to 14 March, like-for-like sales were 0.9%. Within this recent trading has been severely impacted by COVID-19 and the containment measures taken by the Government, including the recommendation to avoid pubs and restaurants which is now expected to lead to a further significant downturn in sales. Marstons has also warned its sales will be “significantly lower”, following official advice to avoid going on. It’s slashing capital expenditure, and says it will suspend rent for its tenants “on a case by case basis”. Recent statements from the UK Government suggest that the current state of much reduced social activity is likely to continue for several months at least. If that is the case, it is unlikely that an interim dividend will be recommended in May, retaining c.£20 million in the business. 7.42am GMT Introduction: Is the Fiscal Fightback enough? The floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly last night Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The fiscal fightback against the coronavirus has begun, but will it be enough? Yesterday, politicians on both sides of the Atlantic promised massive spending programmes to ward off the huge recession that is heading our way, as countries go into lockdown. UK chancellor Rishi Sunak pledged to do “whatever it takes”, as he unveiled a £350bn package of loans and grants. The government is offering state loan guarantees worth £330bn a one-year break from business rates grants of up to £25,000 for struggling retailers and pubs a mortgage holiday of up to three months for customers hurt by the crisis Related: 'Whatever it takes': chancellor announces £350bn aid for UK businesses Eurozone governments are also also fighting back. France is pledging €45bn in direct tax breaks and support for companies, as part of a €300bn package. Spain announced €100bn of loans and guarantees. In the US, Donald Trump is now pushing for a $1.2trn bailout package - bigger than expected - that would see $1,000 checks sent to each American. This would need Congressional approval, of course. The White House is also offering tax deferrals, to help families through the crisis. Yesterday, New Zealand unveiled a NZ$12.1bn stimulus package - worth 4% of GDP - that includes wage subsidies, business tax relief and healthcare funding. Related: New Zealand launches massive spending package to combat Covid-19 But financial markets aren’t terribly convinced. Wall Street did jump by 6% last night, but it’s now down 5% (limit-down) in the futures market. European markets are heading for another tumble - handing back yesterday’s rally. The FTSE 100 index is on track for a 4% slide, having gained 2.8% on Tuesday. European Opening Calls:#FTSE 5065 -4.35%#DAX 8545 -4.41%#CAC 3828 -4.10%#AEX 405 -4.58%#MIB 14597 -4.69%#IBEX 6244 -3.92%#OMX 1332 -2.94%#STOXX 2413 -4.64%#IGOpeningCall — IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) March 18, 2020 Asia-Pacific markets have already taken a tumble: Japan’s Nikkei: down 284 points or 1.68% at 16,726 points China’s CSI 300: down 73 points or 2% at 3,636 points Australia’s S&P ASX 200: down 340 points or 6.4% at 4,953 points Investors fear that these new packages may still not be enough to protect economies though the crisis. Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at OANDA: That call appears to be finally being heeded by governments around the world. Globally, from New Zealand to Spain, impressively large fiscal packages are being rolled out to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus recession. Most pleasingly, the United States seems to be finally getting its act together, with the White House seeking approval for a $1.2 trillion package that includes direct payments to households. The White House is proposing two tranches, of $1,000 and $2,000 to qualifying Americans within two weeks. Other proposals were $300 billion in small business loans and income tax payment deferrals. Off course this all needs to be approved by Congress, and one could argue, it probably isn’t enough. UK supermarkets are starting to impose restrictions on shoppers. From today, Sainsbury’s will also be restricting shoppers to buying a maximum of three items of any grocery product and two packets of popular items such as toilet paper, soap and UHT milk. Related: Sainsbury’s to close its meat, fish and pizza service counters to free up staff Two UK property funds froze yesterday, reflecting the slump in values of offices and warehouses - and more may follow. Ryan Hughes, head of active portfolios at AJ Bell, explains: “The suspension of the Kames Property Income fund has been swiftly followed by the Janus Henderson UK Property fund also suspending on the basis of material uncertainty over the valuation of UK commercial property. With independent valuers finding it impossible to accurately value property given the major economic uncertainty, there is little choice but to suspend dealing. The markets are likely to remain in turmoil until there are signs that the covonavirus crisis is easing. And we’re nowhere close .The global death toll from coronavirus is nearing 8,000, with 198,006 recorded cases worldwide.

In fact, she is making the most of her ninth decade by taking on a new challenge – her first restaurant. On the terrace of her hillside home in the coastal village of Pioppi, two hours south of Naples, A Casa di Delia, is reached by narrow stone steps through a garden. From vine-shaded tables, diners look out across the Tyrrhenian Sea, where windsurfers leave white trails in the sparkling blue water. Cilento map There is no menu. Instead Delia’s son Angelo, who moved back to Campania from Rome to help with his mum’s venture, brought us dish after dish of seasonal specialities: anchovies in lemon; broad strips of homemade pasta with tomatoes, capers, olives and tuna; more anchovies, this time deep-fried; melanzane parmigiana – a rich, oozy aubergine, tomato and cheese bake. We barely had room for the cannoli, handmade using the bamboo that grows around the house, and stuffed with chocolate custard. It was a typical feast from Campania, a region renowned for its seafood, tomatoes (said to be the secret to Neapolitan pizza), and buffalo mozzarella – but there’s nothing typical about Delia. Decades before Jamie Oliver made his fortune from the rustic cuisine of southern Italy, Delia played her part in bringing the local way of eating to the world’s attention. For 40 years she worked as housekeeper and cook for the US scientist Ancel Keys, who moved to Pioppi in the early 1960s after studying the link between the local diet and the low rate of cardiovascular disease in the area. Delia Morinelli. Photograph: Isabel Choat “He wanted to eat what I cooked for Giannino,” Delia told me, smiling at her 87-year-old husband, a former fisherman. Keys coined the term “Mediterranean diet”, detailing its benefits – and some of Delia’s recipes – in How to Eat Well and Stay Well the Mediterranean Way, co-written with his wife and published in 1975. The book put the pretty but otherwise unremarkable fishing village of Pioppi on the map. An old palazzo on the seafront now houses the Mediterranean diet museum, which highlights the health benefits of lots of fruit and vegetables, oily fish and limited meat; and the many speciality vegetables and grains grown in the area. Meanwhile, Delia is a local celebrity and an official ambassador for the diet. Just south of the Amalfi coast, the Cilento is Italy’s second-largest national park, yet relatively few foreign tourists come here. This is partly due to access – it’s about a two-hour drive from Naples airport – and partly due to a lack of large-scale accommodation. We spent a week at Le Favate, an agriturismo in a 17th-century house a few miles inland from the seaside town of Ascea. Managed by Caterina Socco, whose grandfather opened the park’s first agriturismo in 1989 and whose mum cooks, it is everything you could want in an Italian hideaway – a beautiful, secluded family enterprise with fantastic food that we could never finish. At sunset, our building glowed pinky orange and swallows dive bombed the pool. Terrace at A Casa di Delia restaurant. Photograph: Isabel Choat Arriving on a Sunday lunchtime, I headed straight to the village of Santa Barbara to stock up on essentials for our apartment. Of course nowhere was open, except the local bar. I wandered in and five minutes after asking where I could buy some food, I was in my car, following a local back down the hill to his farm. There, he filled a giant bucket with fruit and vegetables picked straight from the fields and orchards. I returned to Le Favate with enough tomatoes to feed a Roman army. To eat in the Cilento is to have that old M&S ad ringing in your ear ... These aren’t any old tomatoes, they are the finest tomatoes known to man. Montoro copper onions are the sweetest onions you’ll ever taste. The buffalo mozzarella is the best in the country – and therefore the world. Many of the villages in the national park are famed for a single product: in Cicerale, it’s chickpeas; in Menaica, it’s anchovies; while Prignano is devoted to the white fig. A total of 26 products grown or made in the park are recognised and protected by the Slow Food Movement. Beach Club 93 Photograph: PR I spent a day zigzagging across the park on a mini culinary road trip via sleepy villages where residents still evidently enjoy the longevity Keys first identified. In Gioi, I tracked down the tiny butcher’s that produces soppressata di Gioi, a spicy sausage with lard in the middle. In Felitto – famed for fusillo pasta – I found the shop that sells the noodle-like delicacy – though at €5.50 a packet it cost about what I paid for a lunch of fusillo with ragù in the village of Stio. After hours of driving around in 40C heat, I stopped off at a secluded swimming spot in Gole del Calore (the Calore gorge) near Felitto, where kids used a concrete slope as a water slide and leapt into a separate narrow channel with pinpoint accuracy. Stepping into the cool, pure water of the river was the most delicious moment of the day. Gole del Calore. Photograph: Isabel Choat Life in these honey-coloured settlements in the folds of wooded hillsides may move as slowly as treacle but it’s not preserved in aspic. Local entrepreneurs are starting to offer the Cilento’s main asset – its food – in a more modern, upscale environment. Giuseppe Pagano, owner of the Savoy Beach Hotel on the edge of the park and the sophisticated Beach Club 93 opposite, recently turned his attention (not to mention a substantial sum of money) to food and wine. La Dispensa Photograph: Antonio Alaimo/PR His vineyard, San Salvatore 1988 (book ahead to visit), is the only commercial winery in the national park, producing 12 wines from five grape varieties. His buffalo farm produces mozzarella, plus ice-cream, yoghurt and cheese, all sold in nearby La Dispensa, a deli and restaurant that opened last year. It’s a slick operation, in keeping with Pagano’s philosophy that “things have to be beautiful and good”, but this is rural Italy and the wine is still a bargain from about €3 a glass and the ice-cream is fantastic. Pagano is as smooth as one of his reds but there’s no doubting his devotion to the land and its products. Showing me around the deli, he joked that his buffalos are the happiest in the land. “We play them classical music and they have a view of Capri,” he said pointing at the speck of land in the hazy distance. Animal welfare is promoted heavily at the area’s most famous buffalo farm too, Tenuta Vannulo, a vast operation where you can see the buffalo, watch men in white coats cut the mozzarella by hand, and of course, sample the products. Its restaurant is another sophisticated spot with a €29 set menu – pricey for these parts but popular with Italian families. A room terrace at Borgo la Pietraia guesthouse Photograph: PR Vannulo and La Dispensa are both close to the extraordinary ruins of Paestum, the city founded by the Greeks around 600BC to exploit the fertile land. Borgo la Pietraia, a guesthouse that opened the high-end FOOD restaurant last year, where we dined on spaghetti cacio e pepe with tuna, is also nearby. The outer walls and doors of Borgo la Pietraia are painted bright red and green but inside it’s all cool shades and minimalism. In the evening I felt distinctly underdressed compared with the local Italians who came for cocktail hour and DJ tunes on the terrace. These new tourism ventures aren’t just helping to shine a spotlight on the Cilento, they are creating jobs, luring back the young who in the past have left the region in search of work. People like 30-year-old Chiara Pierro, director of communication at the Savoy Beach Hotel, who moved to Milan in her early 20s to work for one of the big fashion houses. It’s not hard to see why Pierro wanted to return to her roots. As well as its mountainous interior and idyllic villages, the Cilento has a gorgeous coast. Some of our most memorable moments were eating and drinking by the sea, from Delia’s place to the deck of Caffè del Capitano in the fishing village of Marina di Pisciotta, watching our son play in the lagoon. As the sun set, we sat drinking aperol spritzes – not strictly part of the Mediterranean diet, but good for the soul nonetheless. Way to go Where to stay Accommodation was provided by Le Favate (doubles from €90 B&B, apartments from €700 a week B&B) and Borgo La Pietraia (doubles from €80 B&B). Getting around Car hire was provided by Sicily by Car. A week’s rental from Naples airport costs from €400, including insurance. Flights There are flights to Naples from Gatwick (easyJet, BA), Stansted (Ryanair) and Luton (easyJet) year round. The budget airlines fly from East Midlands, Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol, Edinburgh and Birmingham from March-October, and Belfast June-October. When to go The shoulder seasons of April/May and September/October are best. If you go in July or August, stay somewhere with air conditioning.","Id":"travel/2018/feb/02/food-tour-cilento-campania-italy-mediterranean-diet-delia-morinelli","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webTitle":"Inspired by Italy’s Delia: a food tour of Cilento, Campania","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/feb/02/food-tour-cilento-campania-italy-mediterranean-diet-delia-morinelli","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/feb/02/food-tour-cilento-campania-italy-mediterranean-diet-delia-morinelli","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":1493,"webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T06:30:22Z","id":"travel/2018/feb/02/food-tour-cilento-campania-italy-mediterranean-diet-delia-morinelli","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"City breaks with kids: Rome","body":"I’m bored! Rome offers several offbeat, not-too academic museums and art galleries. The Centrale Montemartini (€7,50, under-6s free) is always a hit with my son. A short stroll from Garbatella metro station, it has Greek and Roman statues, busts and friezes masterfully displayed in a converted power plant built in 1932. The towering turbines, defunct diesel engines and colossal steam boilers create an exciting backdrop for the marble sculptures. There are free guided tours designed for children. ‘Students’ at the Gladiator School and Museum Photograph: gruppostoricoromano.it Another sure-fire hit is the Gladiator School and Museum (free admission, lesson a rather pricy €55). For the two-hour gladiator training class, children dress up in tunics and leather armour and learn basic swordsmanship, history and battle strategy. It could be a special treat – or a reward after visiting the Colosseum. The Zoology Museum (free for under-6s and for adults on the first Sunday of the month, €7 for over-6s ) is in the city zoo (Bioparco) and has five million specimens of insects, birds, mammals and fossils. In the modern wing are interactive exhibits and 3D reconstructions, life-size giraffes, mammoth whale skeletons and other beloved behemoths. Where are all the other kids? Casa delle Civette, in Villa Torlonia park. Photograph: Alamy Villa Torlonia in the elegant Nomentano neighbourhood covers 13.2 manicured hectares of bucolic bliss. Casa delle Civette (€6 when exhibitions are on, otherwise free), a home-turned-museum with period furniture and fairytale-like architecture, is in the park, but the main draw for children is the several play areas with swings, slides and jungle gyms. If your children are flagging, pop into La Limonaia for cake and lemonade, also in the park. Close to the Colosseum and Baths of Caracalla, the picnic place where Roman families hang out at weekends is Villa Celimontana (Via della Navicella), a 16th-century estate built on an ancient vineyard. The property changed hands many times and was transformed into a public park in 1926. The villa gardens are a lush green pocket in the heart of Imperial Rome, dotted with remnants of ancient temples, columns, statues and fountains. We go to concerts, treasure hunts and other family events here all summer long. I’m hungry A trapizzino is a focaccia pocket filled with tasty things Photograph: PR Kids’ menus are not common in Italy, but restaurants will gladly do a mezza porzione (half portion). Family mealtime at child-friendly venues is noon and 7.30pm. The Explora Children’s Museum complex just upped its dining offer by including one of Italy’s best pizzerias, an outpost of Naples’ Da Michele (pizzas from €7.50). Hostaria Buccilli (full meal with wine €50pp) is a family-run trattoria in a countryside setting on the edge of the city. Offering home-cooked food and a warm welcome, Buccilli’s biggest asset is an enclosed orchard where kids can scamper while parents dine under vine pergolas and parasols. In winter, we always book a table by the fireplace. There are high chairs and friendly staff, and waiter Luigi speaks fluent English. Ice-creams at Fatamorgana Photograph: prova/Fatamorgana As a healthy alternative to fast food, my son tucks into a trapizzino, a triangular focaccia pocket stuffed with typical Roman cuisine for €4, sold at outlets in Testaccio and Ponte Milvo. Seasonal fillings may include saucy meatballs, chicken cacciatore or aubergine parmigiana. The Ponte Milvio branch is a short walk from the Foro Italico sports complex and Stadio Olimpico football stadium. Gelato is always a good idea, especially if homemade, fresh and not containing additives or artificial flavourings. Fatamorgana (small cone/cup €2.50) is regarded as one of Rome’s best. Flavours include dark chocolate-orange, apple-cinnamon, ricotta and fig, white chocolate and mint … the list goes on. I’m tired Buonanotte Garibaldi B&B.

From Tuesday, a nationwide curfew will be lengthened by four hours to 5pm until 5am to suppress the spread of the virus. The previous curfew measures started at 9pm.

Photograph: Carlos Lemos/EPA Updated at 12.11am GMT 11.58pm GMT Summary The White House Correspondents Association said one of its members is suspected of having Covid-19, something that could put Donald Trump’s daily press briefings at risk - or at least raise the possibility of them being done remotely. Donald Trump asked the country not to blame Asian Americans. Reiterating a Tweet of his from earlier in the day, Trump at a White House press briefing said: “It’s very important that we protect our Asian American community in the US and all around the world. They’re amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form.” Antonio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, has appealed for an immediate global ceasefire, calling on an end to all armed conflicts so that the world can instead focus on fighting Coronavirus. The UK was placed under lockdown. Boris Johnson will order police to enforce a strict coronavirus lockdown, with a ban on gatherings of more than two people and strict limits on exercise, as he told the British public: “You must stay at home.” Japan’s government is negotiating with the International Olympic Committee to postpone the Tokyo Olympic Games by a maximum one year, the Sankei newspaper reported on Tuesday. Global recoveries passed 100,000 but the pandemic ‘is accelerating’. The World Heath Organization said it had taken 67 days from the first reported case to reach the first 100,000 cases, 11 days for the second 100,000 cases, and only four for the third 100,000 cases. UK deaths reach 335 and Britons abroad told to come home. The Foreign Office urged as many as a million Britons on holiday or business trips abroad to return to the UK immediately. Italy registered a smaller day-to-day increase in new coronavirus cases for the second day. The death toll from the outbreak grew by 602 to 6,078, the head of the Civil Protection Agency said. While that is an 11% increase, it is the smallest nominal rise since last Thursday. The first UK clinical trial enrolled patients. Researchers from the University of Oxford launched a clinical trial to test the effects of potential drug treatments for patients admitted to hospital with the virus. There are currently no specific treatments for the coronavirus, but it is possible that existing drugs used for other conditions may have some benefits. New York state confirmed 20,000 infections. The governor, Andrew Cuomo, said the state had 5,707 new cases, meaning it has confirmed 20,875 in total. Panama confirmed the death one of the youngest victims of the virus, a 13-year-old girl. Medical experts have been trying to drum home the warning that, while older people and those with underlying conditions are at greater risk, they are not the only ones who need to take precautionary measures. Denmark extended its lockdown. The nationwide restrictions will now last until 13 April. Russia may be forced to put off a public vote on amendments allowing Vladimir Putin to hold office until 2036. The Kremlin has not rescheduled the 22 April vote, but the prospect was explicitly acknowledged by Putin’s spokesman. Updated at 12.05am GMT 11.49pm GMT Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and his beard have taken to Twitter to remind people to stay home. You need to stay home. And so do your friends and family members. Help spread the word with your own video - and tag your friends to remind them to stay home too. And together, we can #PlankTheCurve. @MichaelBuble and @VancityReynolds - can you help? #StayAtHomeSaveLives pic.twitter.com/f1PQQrzMIK — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) March 23, 2020 Updated at 11.50pm GMT 11.47pm GMT Back to the White House now, where Dr Anthony Fauci, the head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is absent. My colleague David Smith is in the White House briefing room, and just asked President Trump, “Where is Dr. Fauci?” Dr Fauci has become a trusted public figure during the coronavirus crisis, sometimes speaking alongside the president. He did not appear at today’s briefing. “I was just with him,” Trump said, explaining that Fauci was “at a task force meeting.” David Smith asked Trump if Fauci agreed with him about the need to re-start the economy. d“He doesn’t not agree,” Trump said. “He understands there’s a tremendous cost to our country.” Updated at 11.47pm GMT 11.37pm GMT The Tokyo 2020 Olympic games look increasingly like they will become Tokyo 2021. But – perhaps in an effort to provide those under lockdown with consolation prize edge-of-their-sofa entertainment – there is still no official announcement from Japan or the International Olympic Committee. What we are hearing is that Japan’s government is negotiating with the IOC to postpone the games by a maximum one year – as reported in the Sankei newspaper on Tuesday. 11.26pm GMT In Australia now, where the market opened up about 2% on Tuesday morning despite a raft of companies revealing the damage the coronavirus pandemic was doing to their operations and falls overseas overnight. Mining giant Rio Tinto said it was cutting production in South Africa and Canada due to the outbreak. Broadcaster Seven West Media withdrew n its profit forecasts, citing a fall in ads and the postponement of the Olympics. Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, which was formed from the merger of the Australian Westfield group with France’s Unibail-Rodamco and owns shopping centres across Europe and the US, will cancel its final dividend this year but is pressing ahead with an interim one, due to be paid on Thursday. Shaver Shop has cancelled its dividend. Many of the companies worst affected by the pandemic, including travel agency Flight Centre and online flight sales site Webjet, are suspended from trade. 11.21pm GMT We’re moving away from that press conference now with an update from California from the Guardian’s Mario Koran: Speaking at an afternoon press conference governor Gavin Newsom updated Californians on where the situation stands with available hospital beds and hotel rooms for the state’s unhoused. Here’s snapshot of the state’s preparedness, by the numbers, according to Newom: Rooms and hospital beds: 108,000: the number of unhoused in California who need shelter 51,000: the number of hotel rooms Newsom plans to provide for the unhoused 416: Hospitals in California 78,000: Hospital beds that typically exist in the state. 19,500: The number of beds that the state will have to have to meet demand due to coronavirus. 1,000: Number of beds at skilled nursing facilities Newsom is looking to add to assist the elderly Unemployment claims: 2,000: Unemployment claims California sees in a typical day 40,000: Unemployment claims California saw a week ago Monday 140,000: Unemployment claims the state saw yesterday (meaning it may take additional time to issue payments). 11.20pm GMT Dr Deborah Birx says “Understand the way you get to [infection rates of 60%, for example] is you do nothing. They’re talking about three cycles.” The three cycles are over three years - infections each season in 2020, 2021 etc. “The reason we’re so much focussed on blunting the curve on this piece is that when the virus comes back we’ll be much better prepared.” 11.18pm GMT Asked when antibody tests will be rolled out, Dr Deborah Birx says she thinks “we’re still a couple of weeks out.” 11.17pm GMT Asked how confident she is for the start dates for infection curves for each area, Dr Deborah Birx says: If you look at the pandemic flu preparedness. All of this was built on the flu platform. It was never thought that you’d have a simultaneous respiratory disease hitting at the same time. 11.15pm GMT ‘Uh-oh’ A bizarre moment of comedy came earlier in this press conference. “Saturday, I had a little low-grade fever,” Dr. Deborah Birx said. “Uh-oh,” President Trump says, and backs away from the podium. (She said she got a test and tested negative, and the president eventually moved back.) Birx: \"Saturday, I had a little low grade fever.\" Trump jokes, \"Oh-oh!\" and recoils in cartoon fashion. Birx says she tested negative. Trump says, \"Phew!\" — David Smith (@SmithInAmerica) March 23, 2020 11.13pm GMT Trump: A bad economy causes deaths too, because of suicide Trump has repeatedly suggested that a damaged American economy could create “more death” than potential deaths from the coronavirus. “People get tremendous anxiety and depression and you have suicide over things like this, when you have a terrible economy, you have death, definitely would be in far greater numbers than we’re talking about with regard to the virus,” Trump said. “We have a double obligation. We have a great country, there’s no country like it in the world, and there’s no economy like it in the world.” Trump: \"This is going away. We're going to win the battle. But we have tremendous responsibility.\" You have suicides in terrible economies. — David Smith (@SmithInAmerica) March 23, 2020 11.11pm GMT Hi, Helen Sullivan here. Still with this Trump presser for now. Asked about his comments regarding not blaming Asian-Americans, Trump says: “It seems there could have been a bit of nasty language towards the Asian Americans in our country.” 11.07pm GMT Trump: ‘We’ll see what happens’ Major theme of this press conference: Trump wants to get the American economy going again as soon as possible, and is not open to the idea of restrictive public health measures going on for months. Asked what he would do if, a week from now, public health experts asked him to extend public health restrictions, Trump said, “We’ll see what happens.” Later, Trump said that very soon “we’re going to be opening up our country.” Asked by a reporter if that meant “weeks or months,” Trump s aid, “I’m not looking at months, I can tell you right now.” Trump is asked what will happen if, a week from now, doctors want him to maintain restrictions but he wants to start reopening the economy. “We’ll see what happens,” he says. “We can do two things at one time.” (Health officials will certainly say: no, we really can't.) — Josh Wingrove (@josh_wingrove) March 23, 2020 11.01pm GMT White House highlights NYC area as ‘troubling’ coronavirus hot spot Dr Deborah Birx, the response coordinator for Trump’s coronavirus task force, is addressing tonight’s White House coronavirus press briefing and issues strong warnings about New York, New Jersey and Long Island, saying they are areas of special concern. She says coronavirus has an attack rate close to 1 in 1,000 in this area and that 28% of submitted specimens are positive in this area, compared to about 8% in the rest of the country. “This is the group that absolutely needs to social distance, clearly the virus had been circulating for a number of weeks in order to have this level of penetrance of the general community,” she says. Dr. Birx on the NYC area: \"Clearly the virus had been circulating there for a numbers of weeks to have this level of [penetration] into the local community.\" (So the coronavirus was spreading in NYC as Trump suggested it would go away on its own.) pic.twitter.com/fDBddpr5fp — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) March 23, 2020 10.44pm GMT ‘This will be a great victory’ against a ‘horrible, invisible enemy’, says Trump Trump is finishing up his televised press conference now and has some words of comfort to offer to the nation. “I know this is a challenging time for all Americans, we are enduring a great national trial and we will meet the moment,” says Trump. Trump says that Covid-19 is a “horrible, invisible enemy. We’re at war, in a true sense we’re at war.” For those who are feeling alone and isolated, we are joined ... by a spirit of courage, and love and patriotism. No American is alone as long as we’re united and we are united, we’re very united... No force is equal to the strength of a united America. For those worried and afraid, please know that as long as I’m your president I will fight for you. This will be a great victory, and it will be a victory that in my opinion will happen much sooner than predicted. There’s never been anything like this and it’s vicious, some people recover well and some people have a hard time, we all know that. But we will be victorious. Finishing up, Trump says: “I’m very proud to be your president, you’re very special people.” 10.32pm GMT Donald Trump President Donald Trump speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Briefing Room. Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP Donald Trump, who is addressing the country from the White House now, has said that the US economy will “skyrocket” when this crisis has passed. He also says that the timeline for things to return to normal is much shorter than some are saying. Life will return to normal, the president said, and it will happen a lot faster than the three to four months some have projected. Trump has also said that hospital ships will be deployed around the country and “alternate care sites” will be built, including additional 1,000-bed hospital sites. Trump is now listing the medical and protective equipment that has been delivered to states experiencing the largest numbers of the cases, including ventilators, surgical masks and surgical gowns. Trump says “whatever the states need they should be getting, we’re sort of a back-up for the states”. The president is praising the private sector for its help in increasing production of PPE. 10.22pm GMT Donald Trump tells country not to blame Asian-Americans and says US was 'not built to be shut down' Hi, this is Kate Lyons taking over the blog, which began its life 24 hours ago in Australia and has travelled around the world to arrive back in Sydney again. Donald Trump is addressing the country at a televised press conference from the White House at the moment. After an awkward delay of several minutes, the US president has just taken the stage to begin the coronavirus press briefing today. Trump then reiterates almost word for word the message he tweeted out a few minutes ago: “It’s very important that we protect our Asian American community in the US and all around the world. They’re amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form.” ....is NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form. They are working closely with us to get rid of it. WE WILL PREVAIL TOGETHER! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2020 That new message, after the Trump administration spent a week embracing the racist tactic of calling coronavirus the “Chinese virus” and then responding with outrage and denial when it was labeled as racist, comes in the wake of growing evidence of the toll of racist attacks, harassment and blame targeting Asian Americans across the country. Trump opened his press conference with the promise that “the hardship will end. It will end soon.” “Our country was not built to be shut down,” Trump said. “This is not a country that was built for this. It was not built to be shut down.” 10.12pm GMT Cuba is the latest to close its schools, reports CNN’s Havana bureau chief: Just in: Cuba to suspend classes at all schools for a month. — Patrick Oppmann CNN (@CNN_Oppmann) March 23, 2020 10.01pm GMT The AFP news agency calculates that around 1.7 billion people across the world are now living under some form of lockdown due to coronavirus: Plus d'1,7 milliard de personnes confinées dans le monde, une pandémie toujours en expansion, le point en France: ce qu'il faut retenir sur le covid-19 au 23 mars #AFP pic.twitter.com/Ovxvw33uhN — Agence France-Presse (@afpfr) March 23, 2020 9.51pm GMT Asylum seekers and refugees in immigration detention centres across Australia say it is impossible for them to self-isolate and protect themselves from the virus. “We are sitting ducks for Covid-19 and extremely exposed to becoming severely ill, with the possibility of death,” detainees from across immigration detention centres have written in a letter to prime minister Scott Morrison, pleading to be released into the community on health grounds. Asylum seekers and refugees said they were “anxious and scared” of a Covid-19 outbreak inside detention, saying they were being held “in a potential death trap in which we have no option or means to protect ourselves”. The Australian government’s own advisory says “people in detention facilities” are considered most at risk of serious infection of Covid-19. Visits to immigration detention centres – including by family members – have been cancelled.

Orders in both provinces are set to go into effect on Tuesday at midnight. The shut-down – which comes after both Ontario and Quebec ordered all bars and restaurants to close last week – does not apply to essential businesses such as pharmacies and grocery stores. Both provinces have said they will release a list of businesses permitted to remain open on Tuesday morning. “This was a very, very tough decision. But it is the right decision … This decision was not made lightly and the gravity of this order does not escape me,” said Ontario premier Doug Ford at a press conference on Monday. “But as I’ve said from day one, we will – and we must – take all steps necessary to slow the spread of Covid-19.” Ontario recorded 78 new cases of the coronavirus on Monday, bringing the province’s total to 503. Canada has recorded nearly 2,000 cases of the virus, and 21 deaths. Ford’s announcement follows stern remarks from prime minister Justin Trudeau earlier in the day, where he chastised Canadians for ignoring pleas from public health officials to stay home and avoid gatherings outside. Quebec, which was the first province in the country to declare a state of emergency last week, is also planning to curtail its economy in dramatic fashion. “Quebec will hit pause for three weeks,” Quebec premier François Legault said Monday. “The faster we can limit contact between people, the faster we can limit the contagion and get back to normal life. I’m asking all Quebeckers to cooperate.” 9.07pm GMT UK: police to enforce lockdown Heather Stewart and Rowena Mason report on the drastic new measures just announced that will take the UK into lockdown: Boris Johnson will order police to enforce a strict coronavirus lockdown, with a ban on gatherings of more than two people and strict limits on exercise, as he told the British public: “You must stay at home.” The prime minister ratcheted up Britain’s response with an address to the nation on Monday evening, warning that people will only be allowed outside to buy food or medication, exercise alone once a day, or to travel to work if absolutely necessary. All non-essential shops will close with immediate effect, as will playgrounds and libraries, he said in the address from Downing Street. After days of being accused of sending mixed messages about what the public should do, Johnson significantly escalated his language as he urged people to comply with the new, more stringent measures. “You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say No. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine – and you should do this as little as you can,” he said. “If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.” Related: Boris Johnson orders UK lockdown to be enforced by police Updated at 9.08pm GMT 8.58pm GMT In Australia, the state of Queensland has announced that it will shut its borders tomorrow.

He says people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following “very limited purposes”: Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible. One form of exercise a day – for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household. Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person. Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home. That’s all – these are the only reasons you should leave your home. You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say No. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine – and you should do this as little as you can.

Tendayi Achiume, assistant professor of law at UCLA, said US president’s “calculated use of a geographic-based name” for the virus was leading to the stigmatising of people perceived to be of Chinese or east Asian descent. The World Health Organization, in its guidance for naming new infectious diseases, has previously warned that certain names can provoke a backlash against members of religious and ethnic communities. In a statement published to mark the international day for the elimination of racism, which was on Friday, Achiume said: These consequences have already become a reality. Over the past two months, people who are perceived or known to be of Chinese or other East Asian descent have been subject to racist and xenophobic attacks related to the virus. These attacks have ranged from hateful slurs to denial of services to brutal acts of violence. Covid-19-related expressions of racism and xenophobia online have included harassment, hate speech, proliferation of discriminatory stereotypes, and conspiracy theories. Not surprisingly, leaders who are attempting to attribute COVID-19 to certain national or ethnic groups are the very same nationalist populist leaders who have made racist and xenophobic rhetoric central to their political platforms. 7.54pm GMT Edouard Philippe, the French prime minister, has said that country’s lockdown could last several more weeks, with new restrictions – including limits on daily exercise outside the home – now in place: Any morning constitutional/jogging now has to be within 1km of home, 1 hour max, alone, and only once per day. https://t.co/3CvQzDtZpb — Joseph Schmid (@js_paname) March 23, 2020 7.49pm GMT Olympics reportedly 'to be postponed' The International Olympic Committee is facing almost irresistible pressure to postpone the Tokyo Olympics this week rather than wait until its mid-April deadline – with a growing number of athletes, governments and national federations saying it is unfair to keep them in limbo during the coronavirus pandemic. Veteran IOC member Dick Pound told USA Today that the Games would be postponed, likely to 2021, with the details to be worked out in the next four weeks. “The parameters going forward have not been determined, but the Games are not going to start on July 24, that much I know.” Pound said he believed that the IOC would announce its next steps soon. “It will come in stages,” he said. “We will postpone this and begin to deal with all the ramifications of moving this, which are immense.” Related: Athletes across globe call for Olympic postponement as countries pull out 7.40pm GMT In the Czech Republic, where as of the middle of last week there is ban on being in public spaces without wearing a face mask or some kind of facial covering, volunteers have set to work sewing masks at home. Zdenek Hrib, the mayor of Prague, wrote on Twitter last week: “On Prague public transport, it is mandatory to have a covered mouth and nose! Whether you have medical masks, self-made masks, or use a scarf, anything is better than nothing.” Earlier today, Dagmar Havlova, the widow of playwright-turned-president Vaclav Havel, posted videos on Instagram of her making masks at home. “We are sewing masks and giving them to paramedics free of charge. Wear masks, wash your hands, and keep a sound mind,” she wrote. There is now a fine of up to 20,000 Czech crowns (£670) for not wearing a face covering when in enclosed public spaces. 7.32pm GMT India has announced that it is stopping domestic flights and said the majority of the country was under complete lockdown, Reuters news agency reports: India has reported 471 cases of coronavirus, but health experts have said that a big jump could be imminent, which would overwhelm the underfunded and crumbling public health infrastructure. On Monday, India confirmed two more deaths, bringing the total to nine. One was a 54-year-old man with no history of foreign travel, suggesting the start of community transmission of the virus, officials said. The government ordered commercial airlines to shut down domestic operations from midnight on Tuesday on top of a ban on international flights to try to contain the coronavirus outbreak. About 144 million people travelled on domestic flights last year. Rail travel, which is hugely popular in India, has already been suspended after thousands of people, mostly migrant workers, crowded in train stations to go home as businesses shut down and jobs dried up.

That figure represents almost a third of the people known to have been infected around the world. However, these figures are partly based on official releases and could, therefore, underestimate the number of confirmed cases. The institution has counted 354,677 confirmed cases and 15,436 confirmed deaths. The World Heath Organization said it had taken 67 days from the first reported case to reach the first 100,000 cases, 11 days for the second 100,000 cases, and only four for the third 100,000 cases. UK deaths reach 335 and Britons abroad told to come home According to the Department of Health and Social Care, 6,650 people have tested positive, 77,295 negative and 335 patients have died. That included 46 more deaths in England, as well as four more in both Scotland and Wales. Two people have died from the disease in Northern Ireland, though it did not record any further deaths on Monday. The Foreign Office urged as many as a million Britons on holiday or business trips abroad to return to the UK immediately. Second consecutive smaller daily increase in Italy Italy, which has seen the most deaths of any nation, registered a smaller day-to-day increase in new coronavirus cases. The death toll from the outbreak grew by 602 to 6,078, the head of the Civil Protection Agency said. While that is an 11% increase, it is the smallest nominal rise since last Thursday. First UK clinical trial enrols patients Researchers from the University of Oxford launched a clinical trial to test the effects of potential drug treatments for patients admitted to hospital with the virus. There are currently no specific treatments for the coronavirus, but it is possible that existing drugs used for other conditions may have some benefits. Thousands of medics to rejoin UK’s health service In the House of Commons, the UK’s health secretary Matt Hancock said 7,563 former clinicians had answered his call to return to the NHS to help out during the outbreak. This followed news that thousands of private hospital beds had been secured. New York state confirms 20,000 infections The governor, Andrew Cuomo, said the state had 5,707 new cases, meaning it has confirmed 20,875 in total. Of those, 13% have needed to be cared for in hospital, around a quarter of whom are in intensive care, and 157 people have died. Panama confirms death one of youngest victims Offering yet further evidence that young, healthy people are not invulnerable to Covid-19, Panama confirmed the death of a 13-year-old girl. Medical experts have been trying to drum home the warning that, while older people and those with underlying conditions are at greater risk, they are not the only ones who need to take precautionary measures. Denmark extends lockdown The nationwide restrictions will now last until 13 April. The emergency measures, initially imposed on 11 March for a fortnight, closed schools and restaurants in the Nordic country and kept most public sector workers at home.

My colleague in Afghanistan, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii, has transcribed Gutteres’s speech: The world faces a common enemy: Covid19. The virus doesn’t care about nationality or ethnicity, faction or faith. It attacks all relentlessly. Meanwhile, armed conflict rages on around the world. The most vulnerable - women and children, people with disabilities, the marginalised and displaced - pay the highest price. They are also at the highest risk of suffering devastating losses from Covid-19. Let’s not forget that in war ravaged countries health systems have collapsed. Heath professionals, already few in number, have often been targeted. Refugees and others displaced by violent conflict are doubly vulnerable. The fury of the virus illustrates the folly of war. That is why today I am calling for an immediate global ceasefire in all corners of the world. It is time to put armed conflict on lockdown and focus together on the true fight of our lives. To warring parties, I say: pull back from hostilities. Put aside mistrust and animosity. Silence the guns; stop the artillery; end the airstrikes. This is crucial to help create corridors for life saving aids. To open precious windows for diplomacy. To bring hope to places among the most vulnerable to Covid-19. Let us take inspiration from coalitions and dialogue slowing taking shape among rival parties in some parts to enable joint approaches to Covid-19. But we need much more. End the sickness of war and fight the disease that is ravaging our world. It starts by stopping the fighting everywhere, now. That is what our human family needs, now more that ever. Today I am calling for an immediate global ceasefire in all corners of the world. It is time to put armed conflict on lockdown and focus together on the true fight of our lives – the #COVID19 pandemic.https://t.co/F6JRA6ekvZ pic.twitter.com/7WgtFMk5GC — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) March 23, 2020 7.05pm GMT World health leaders are investigating whether the loss of taste and smell could be an early symptom of coronavirus, amid widespread reports of impaired senses in patients, Mark Rice-Oxley reports. Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the World Health Organisation’s emerging diseases team, said several countries were investigating the reports to establish whether the correlation was significant. He said: We have seen quite a few reports now about people who are in their early stages of disease may lose their sense of smell, may lose the sense of taste, but this is something that we need to look in to, to really capture to see whether this is one of the signs of Covid-19. We have a number of countries that are conducting early investigations where they are capturing standardised information from cases and contacts where they are looking at signs and symptoms. ENT UK, a body representing ear nose and throat doctors, said in a statement that there was evidence from South Korea, China and Italy that significant numbers of patients had developed ‘anosmia’. The statement, issued jointly by top rhinologists Claire Hopkins and Nirmal Kumar, said: In Germany it is reported that more than 2 in 3 confirmed cases have anosmia. In South Korea, where testing has been more widespread, 30% of patients testing positive have had anosmia as their major presenting symptom in otherwise mild cases. 7.00pm GMT Total lockdown imposed in South Africa President Cyril Ramapahosa has imposed a 21 day total lockdown on the 56 million inhabitants of South Africa, telling them in an address on Monday night that the unprecedented and sweeping measures were necessary to avoid a “catastrophe of huge proportions”, Jason Burke reports from Johannesburg. The lockdown will come into effect on Thursday night and be enforced by the police and the army. International flights to major airports have been suspended and strict new quarantine regulations will be imposed. The number of Coronavirus cases in South Africa has risen steeply in recent days, going from 61 to more than 400 in just over a week.

It is clear that ... we need to urgently and dramatically escalate our response,” Ramaphosa said, raising the prospect of tens of thousands or “within a few weeks” hundreds of thousands of cases if nothing was done. South Africa declared a national disaster last week, closed schools and called for social distancing. But the measures were clearly seen as insufficient to stem the spread of the disease in Africa’s most developed nation. Though South Africa has a young population, there are millions who are vulnerable as HIV sufferers or have been weakened by malnutrition. The healthcare system has long suffered an acute lack of resources and critical facilities are extremely limited.

France now has 19,856 confirmed cases of coronavirus, 3,176 more than the previous day, and the death toll from the virus has reached 860, a jump of 186 in 24 hours. There are 8,675 people in hospital with the virus, of whom 2,080 are in intensive care. A banner which reads “Thanks to the caregivers” hangs from a balcony in Paris, where a lockdown is in place to slow the spread of Covid-19 Photograph: Benoît Tessier/Reuters Véran also announced the death of two doctors; a GP and a gynaecologist. They died doing their job and we will not forget them. Véran said 5,000 tests are carried out in France every day. Germany carries out double this number and France is looking to introduce new tests that are “quicker and more rapid”. There are hopes to have these new tests available in the next couple of weeks. I am aware of the sacrifice we are asking of the French people. Everyone understands the importance of the confinement. It is the only way we can stop the coronavirus and save lives. We are all hoping there will be a visible impact and we all hope this impact will happen soon. The confinement is absolutely necessary. He said the French committee for public health had met to look at possible treatments including the anti-malarial hydro-chloroquine. He said the authority had agreed this treatment could not be recommended except in extremely serious cases in hospital conditions, with the agreement of all the clinicians and doctors. All prescriptions of chloroquine were to be banned and people are urged not to self medicate because of the absence of “proven data” showing the benefits. Véran concluded: Fraternity is not an abstract idea or just a word in a motto. The French are proving that fraternity is a choice. The situation is difficult but we will not lose hope. We think of those who are ill and those who are caring for them. 6.45pm GMT Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian’s correspondent in Rome, has some more on the latest Covid-19 death toll and infection statistics from Italy, Europe’s worst affected country Italy’s coronavirus death toll and infection rate slowed for a second day on Monday. Deaths rose by 601 to 6,077, 50 less than on Sunday. New infections rose by 3,780, 177 less than on Sunday. Italy’s civil protection authority said 408 more people had recovered from the virus since Sunday, bringing the total number of people recovered to 7,432. The total number of cases in Italy to date, comprising deaths and those recovered, is at 63,927. “Today the downward trend is confirmed,” said Giulio Gallera, the welfare councillor for Lombardy, the region worst hit. We can say that it is the first positive day, it is not the time to sing victory but we finally see a light at the end of the tunnel.

In a video news conference on Monday the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, also said the bloc support Tehran’s request for IMF financial help. We’ve not been able to provide a lot of humanitarian help but there is some 20 million euros in the pipeline ... that we expect to be delivered over the next weeks ... We also agree in supporting the request by Iran and also by Venezuela to the International Monetary Fund to have financial support.

There are also predictions that Tehran would be hit be a specially large increase due to the big numbers that left the capital for the Iranian new year and due to return soon. The ministry said it was willing to introduce new measures to enforce social distancing saying pleading and pleading was not enough. The widely criticised official figures show the numbers killed each 24 hours by the virus remained steady at 127 with 1,411 new Coronavirus victims. The total number of patients was 23,049 and total deaths 1,812. The number of listed recoveries was 8,376. The average age of infected patients 59 years and age of those died 64 years. The official death rate has now been stable broadly for a week, raising suspicions that the figures have been manipulated. Updated at 6.37pm GMT 6.31pm GMT Germany is to take in six coronavirus patients from Italy for treatment. The patients from Lombardy, the Italian region worst-affected by the virus, will be transported to Saxony in the next few hours, according to a report in La Repubblica. 6.26pm GMT The rest of Europe is watching the UK’s coronavirus plan with disbelief, writes Giles Tremlett, a journalist and author based in Madrid, for the Guardian’s comment pages. Watching the UK from a distance has felt like scrambling out of your car at the front of a multiple pile-up on the motorway, only to see other cars smashing into the rear 20 minutes later. Didn’t anyone warn them about what lay ahead? Surely everyone knew. That is what it looks like from mainland Europe – the new centre of the pandemic.

From today, the 1,800m rink at the Ice Palace, in Madrid’s Hortaleza district, is to be turned into an improvised cold storage facility for the dead, after the closure of the city’s municipal funeral home.Making the announcement on Monday, Madrid’s city council said: Given the progressive increase in the number of deceased and the [inability] of funeral homes to be able to bury them within the established period, the Ice Palace concessionary company has ceded its facilities to house these bodies. According to a report in El Mundo, a “technical surface of synthetic material about two-three centimetres thick” will be installed on the ice rink, so that bodies will not be resting directly on the ice. 6.10pm GMT Foreign Office tells 1m Britons to return to the UK Up to 1 million Britons on holiday or on business trips abroad have been asked to return to the UK immediately by the Foreign Office, as they may not be able to get commercial flights within days. In updated advice, the FCO said British citizens abroad who are resident in the UK should make urgent plans to cut short holidays and other trips and come back home straight away. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, said: “We are strongly urging UK travellers overseas to return home now where and while there are still commercial routes to do so. Around the world, more airlines are suspending flights and more airports are closing, some without any notice. “Where commercial routes don’t exist, our staff are working round the clock to give advice and support to UK nationals. If you are on holiday abroad the time to come home is now while you still can.” Related: Coronavirus: Britons abroad urged to return to UK immediately Updated at 6.11pm GMT 6.03pm GMT An update on the situation with the 2020 Olympics, due to be held in Tokyo later this year. Mike Ryan, head of the World Health Organization’s emergencies programme, said the WHO was feeding into deliberations by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the Japanese government and the Tokyo 2020 Committee. Australia and Canada have already said they are withdrawing from the 2020 Games, while the Swiss Olympic Committee today said the games should be postponed. Organisers are facing increasing pressure to postpone them first time in their 124-year modern history. “I believe a decision will be made very soon,” Ryan said. He said any decision to postpone the Games would be made by Japan and the IOC, adding: We have every confidence that the Japanese government and the IOC will not proceed with any Games should they be dangerous to athletes or spectators. British Olympic Association chairman Hugh Robertson warned it was unlikely the country could send a team to Tokyo should the 2020 Games go ahead as scheduled. “I think it is very simple. If the virus continues as predicted by the (UK) government, I don’t think there is any way we can send a team,” Robertson, a former British sports minister, told Sky Sports News. We are actually in a process where we are talking to all our sports. We will complete that over the next couple of days. At the end of that we have already said to the IOC that we think their four-week pause is absolutely the right thing to do. We can’t see any way that this can go ahead as things are constituted at the moment. Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has suggested the possibility of postponing the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Photograph: Kimimasa Mayama/EPA Earlier, a spokesman for Boris Johnson, the British Prime Minister, urged the IOC to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. “Athletes are facing significant uncertainty in the current environment... We want the International Olympic Committee to make a definitive decision soon, to bring clarity to all of those involved,” the spokesman said. Updated at 6.05pm GMT 5.51pm GMT Smaller daily increase for second day in Italy Italy has registered a smaller day-to-day increase in new coronavirus cases for the second straight day. The death toll from an outbreak of coronavirus in Italy has grown by 602 to 6,078, the head of the Civil Protection Agency said, an 11% increase but the smallest rise in numerical terms since Thursday, suggesting a clear downward trend. On Sunday, 651 people died. That followed 793 on Saturday and 627 on Friday. Updated at 5.56pm GMT 5.34pm GMT France and China are seeking emergency G20 talks over coronavirus. The two countries have agreed on the need for emergency talks by leaders of the G20 major economies to coordinate an international response to the coronavirus crisis, the French presidency has said. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke by phone with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping today, after Saudi Arabia, which currently presides over the G20, last week called for a “virtual” summit. “The two leaders agreed a summit would be helpful in particular on the health front... and on the economic front” the Elysee Palace said in a statement, citing “coordinated fiscal and monetary measures.” Saudi Arabia has called for an extraordinary videoconference of G20 leaders as the economic fallout from the coronavirus lockdowns spreading worldwide hammered financial markets, putting many countries on course for a recession. 5.27pm GMT Coronavirus pandemic is accelerating, the WHO says The spread of the coronavirus is accelerating, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said, with more than 300,000 cases now recorded and infections reported from nearly every country worldwide. It took 67 days from the first reported case to reach the first 100,000 cases of Covid-19, but it took only 11 days for the second 100,000 cases, and just four days for the third 100,000 cases, WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said. Speaking in an online briefing to journalists he said: But we are not prisoners to statistics. We’re not helpless bystanders. We can change the trajectory of this pandemic. He called for global political commitment to change the trajectory of the pandemic, urging countries to take both defensive and attacking measures. Asking people to stay at home and other social distancing measures are an important way of slowing down the spread of the virus and buying time, but they are defensive measures. To win we need to attack the virus with aggressive and targeted tactics - testing every suspect case, isolating and caring for every confirmed cases and tracing and quarantining every close contact.” Updated at 5.37pm GMT 5.20pm GMT A number of French fashion houses have announced they will be producing coronavirus masks Design houses Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga will shift their attentions from high fashion to producing surgical face masks to aid the global coronavirus assault, their parent company Kering said. In a statement posted on its website, Kering said: The French workshops of Kering’s houses Balenciaga and Yves Saint Laurent are preparing to manufacture masks while complying with the strictest health protection measures for their staff members.

Updated at 5.23pm GMT 5.08pm GMT 13-year-old dies of Covid-19 in Panama Panama has confirmed the death of a 13-year-old girl from Covid-19 - one of the youngest reported victims so far, Nina Lakhani reports. Globally, the evidence shows that the virus is much more dangerous in people with preexisting medical conditions and the elderly, with around 20% of infected over 80s dying from complications. But the Panama case illustrates what medical experts have been trying to drum home in recent days: young adults and children are not immune to the virus or serious complications. There’s been growing frustration across the world at sites of busy play parks and beaches full of youngsters. The younger the child, the greater the chance of suffering critical or serious symptoms from the virus, according to one large study from China. An empty highway along the coast in Panama City, where residents are staying at home to avoid the spread of coronavirus Photograph: Luis Acosta/AFP via Getty Images Panama also confirmed the death of a 92-year-old man, bringing the death toll to five. Both victims died in hospital. It’s still unclear whether the 13-year-old victim suffered from preexisting health problems. As of Sunday, 313 cases were confirmed in Panama, which borders Colombia to the south and Nicaragua to the north, of which 42 were hospitalised. Today’s deaths bring the death toll in Central America to eight, but the number of confirmed cases are rapidly rising. Updated at 6.08pm GMT 5.04pm GMT Greek health authorities say coronavirus cases have risen by 71 overnight bringing the total to 695, Helena Smith reports from Athens. Of that number 114 are hospitalised and 35 in intensive care. Earlier Monday, the first day of a nationwide lockdown, the Hellenic National Public Health Organisation announced that coronavirus cases had been confirmed in 28 regions of the country. While the vast majority are in Athens, 16 have also been recorded in Thessaloniki, the northern capital, and 43 in the region of Ileia, in the western Peloponnese. There have been no cases in the Cyclades, which include some of the country’s most popular islands, or on Chios or Samos, the eastern Aegean isles on the frontline of the refugee crisis. A woman crosses Athens’ empty Syntagma square on Monday, when health authorities reported 71 new cases of coronavirus Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP via Getty Images Today, however, state TV said a second case of coronavirus had been confirmed on Lesbos, reporting a 60-year-old Greek man, recently returned from Thailand, had contracted the virus. A woman who was hospitalised on the island earlier this month also after testing positive has been allowed to return home after her condition improved. Seventeen people (14 men, three women) have died as a result of Covid-19 in Greece with authorities announcing the highest daily jump in cases (94) on Sunday. The record leap in infections prompted prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ centre-right government to further restrict movement on Monday in what, with few exceptions, has amounted to a comprehensive lockdown for all citizens in Greece. Those living in the country now have to register with authorities, or send prior notice via SMS to a government hotline, if they venture outdoors – or risk being slapped with a fine of 150 euros that will go into a fund to support the health system 5.01pm GMT Lawyers for Julian Assange, the jailed Wikileaks founder, are to make a fresh application that he be bailed, on the basis that he is vulnerable to the coronavirus outbreak in the UK prison where he is held. Assange is currently being held at the high security Belmarsh prison in south London while proceedings are underway to clear his extradition to the United States, where he is wanted on espionage charges related to Wikileaks’ publishing of American military and diplomatic secrets. Assange’s lawyers will make the application on Wednesday, when he is next expected to appear at Belmarsh magistrates court, which is attached to the prison. It comes after Andrea Albutt, president of the Prison Governors Association, has warned that “there will be deaths” in UK prisons. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Don’t Extradite Assange campaign said: Julian Assange falls into a category of persons who should be released to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 under the recommendations of independent legal charity, the Prison Advisory Service. Last week, campaigners called for Julian Assange’s release and the release of all low risk prisoners to slow the spread of the virus and minimise the number of deaths in prisons. 4.43pm GMT South Africa’s coronavirus cases jumped to 402 on Monday, up 128 from the day before, continuing worrying rise in numbers in the continent’s most developed economy, reports Jason Burke in Johannesburg. There are now 43 countries in Africa hit by Covid-19, 1,600 cases and 54 deaths according to the most recent figures. Cyril Ramaphosa, the South African president, is expected to speak on Monday evening to the nation about the threat from the disease and is widely expected him to announce new restrictive measures to try to slow its spread. More than half of South Africa’s total cases are in the populous and relatively prosperous Gauteng province, which include Johannesburg, the country’s largest city with 5.7 million people, and the capital, Pretoria, with 2.4 million, according to the figures released by the government health ministry.

South Africa has yet not registered a death from the disease and the majority of cases are from travellers from Europe and other countries. Though the number of cases that are locally transmitted is rising in South Africa, there is little evidence so far of drastic change in social behaviour - though the president has declared a national disaster, shut schools and called for the population to forego any non-essential journeys. Though some shops and businesses are shut, traffic on roads is only slightly diminished and supermarkets and shopping malls remain crowded. There have been reports of contingents from the South African army mobilising across the country, pending a possible deployment to enforce a lockdown. 4.30pm GMT British diplomats in Tunisia have failed to find a flight to repatriate British nationals who are stuck in the country, which is on lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus. Earlier we reported that the Tunisian president had ordered the army on to the streets of the country to enforce the lockdown in the country, which has so far recorded 89 cases of Covid-19 and two deaths. The British embassy had been trying to charter an Air Tunis flight to return Britons from the country. But earlier today, the ambassador, Louise de Sousa, tweeted a statement saying that it was proving difficult to find Tunisian air crew willing to fly to Europe. My team and I @UKinTunisia are disappointed not to have better news for stranded \uD83C\uDDEC\uD83C\uDDE7 nationals in \uD83C\uDDF9\uD83C\uDDF3. This is an extraordinarily difficult situation.

However this option is now looking extremely difficult as Tunis Air are unable to find air crew who are prepared to fly to Europe on grounds of their individual safety and potential exposure. 4.20pm GMT Greece is suspending all flights to the UK and Turkey from today until 15 April, citing concerns over coronavirus, the Guardian’s Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, reports. The decision, announced in the government gazette on Sunday, came into force as Aegean Airlines, the country’s largest carrier, broke the news that it, too, was halting all its international routes as of Thursday through to 30 April. The airline said in a statement: Given the extraordinary circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic, travel restrictions imposed by Greece, EU and other states, as well as the newly adopted measures for the restriction of unnecessary movements in Greece, AEGEAN is obliged to proceed with the temporary suspension of its international flights. A small number of weekly flights from Athens to Brussels will be operated, in order to maintain the country’s connectivity with the EU’s administrative centre. The carrier said it would continue to operate repatriation and other emergency flights, and limited domestic routes “ to facilitate minimum essential connectivity for the island’s needs.” Updated at 4.23pm GMT 4.14pm GMT We ran a piece earlier today about a controversial proposal in Hungary that would allow the far-right prime minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree, without a clear cut-off point. This afternoon the Hungarian parliament has rejected changing house rules to pass the bill immediately, as opposition parties refused to vote with Orbán to give him the four-fifths majority he required, Shaun Walker reports from Budapest. However, Orbán said he would pass the bill next week, when his ruling party’s two-thirds majority will be enough to see it through. “We will solve this crisis, even without you,” Orbán told opposition parties in parliament on Monday. While many countries are passing emergency legislation to cope with the threat posed by the coronavirus, critics worry that Orbán, who over a decade in power has been accused of flouting democratic norms and eroding rule of law, would abuse the provisions.

Trudeau reiterated calls for Canadians to abide by social distancing measures by staying at least two metres away from each other and avoiding groups. If you choose to ignore that advice, if you choose to get together with people or to go to crowded places, you are not just putting yourself at risk, you are putting others at risk too: your elderly relative who is in a nursing home, or your friend with a pre-existing condition; our nurses and doctors on the front lines; our workers stacking shelves at a grocery story.

The airline said in a statement: This decision has been made to limit the spread of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus and to protect citizens, residents, and international travellers. The decision comes after an order by the UAE’s national emergency crisis and disaster management authority, and its general civil aviation authority, to suspend all inbound, outbound, and transit passenger flights in the UAE. Tony Douglas, the group chief executive officer of the Etihad aviation group, said: These are unprecedented times and unprecedented decisions are being made by governments, authorities and companies, including Etihad, to contain the spread of the coronavirus and to help minimise its effects around the world. We stand with our loyal customers, who are having to endure disruption and inconvenience to their travel and their daily lives, and we dedicate all our efforts and resources to ensuring we do all we can to assist them with their travel planning during this challenging period. As the national airline, we stand in full support of the UAE government’s decision, and are confident that we’re well prepared to weather the commercial and operational impact this suspension will have on our services. 3.38pm GMT The European Union’s top diplomat has said “fake news” and disinformation are resulting in Europeans being stigmatised for the spread of coronavirus, Jennifer Rankin reports from Brussels. Following a telephone conference with EU foreign ministers on Monday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told reporters there was “clear stigmatisation of European Union citizens abroad”. Another thing that worries us [ministers] and we have been talking about is a clear attempt to discredit European Union, even through clear stigmatisation of European Union citizens abroad, presenting the virus as a kind of white people’s disease and blaming European citizens. He referred to an incident last Thursday when the mayor of Santiago de Guayaquil in Ecuador blocked an empty European plane from landing “to defend the city” against coronavirus. The Iberia plane, which eventually landed in Quito, was repatriating 190 travellers stranded in Ecuador, after flights were suspended to contain the spread of the virus. Borrell said it had been claimed the plane was “bringing the disease” adding that “spreading disinformation is playing with people’s lives”. Borrell referred to the EU’s disinformation taskforce, which recently produced a report that said pro-Kremlin media were producing false stories about coronavirus with the aim of “aggravating” the public health crisis in the west. He said the problem was “not a matter” of declarations by any government, but rather “the wide spread of fake news produces reactions and produces attitudes among people which are very dangerous”. Separately the EU executive announced that Italy was among four countries to respond to a call of help from Croatia, after Zagreb was struck by its biggest earthquake in 140 years.

Updated at 3.37pm GMT 3.30pm GMT Like Eve eyeing the forbidden fruit, Ireland is debating whether to take a mighty bite out of €14bn in disputed taxes paid by Apple, Rory Carroll reports from Dublin. The money – held in an escrow account pending a court case - could help pay for emergency measures to support workers, companies and a health care system all hit by coronavirus. Ireland collected the windfall after the European commission ruled in August 2016 that the tech giant had received unfair tax incentives from the Irish government. A temporary coronavirus testing centre on the quays of the River Liffey in Dublin Photograph: Aidan Crawley/EPA Both the Irish government – which does not want to alienate big tech - and Apple are appealing, saying the correct tax was paid. The appeal ruling could be a decade away – so distant it can be ignored to deal with the current crisis, say some. “I’m not sure Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, would put up much of a fight if we decided to spend the money now,” Chris Johns, a columnist, wrote in the Irish Times. Mary Lou McDonald, the leader of Sinn Fein, has made the same suggestion, saying the money coule be spent “right this minute”. But the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, is not biting. On Monday he accused McDonald of talking rubbish. “The European courts will decide whether that money either belongs to Apple or comes to the Irish revenue commissioners and then has to be distributed out among the counties of Europe. It’s not ours to take and it’s now before the courts. She should know better before coming out with that kind of rubbish.” Updated at 4.44pm GMT 3.27pm GMT While Canada’s shared border with the United States has closed down to any non-essential travel, two Canadian provinces have taken the rare step of closing their own borders stop the spread of the coronavirus, writes Leyland Cecco in Toronto. Both Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island have tightened restrictions on their borders, requiring anyone returning to either province to self-isolate for two weeks. Announcing a state of emergency for the province, premier Stephen McNeil said: For those who are not essential service and want to enter our province for social purposes, please stay home. In addition to border restrictions, all non-essential businesses, as well as city and provincial parks have been ordered closed. The province’s justice minister has suggested police enforcement might be used to enforce social distancing and to break up public gatherings. Prince Edward Island, Canada’s smallest province, began monitoring bridges, ferry terminals and airports over the weekend. While the Maritime provinces— Nova Scotia, New Brunswick Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island—have documented few cases, there is growing worry their aging population is vulnerable to the quickly-spreading coronavirus. 3.16pm GMT Denmark extends lockdown Denmark has extended its nationwide lockdown until 13 April, Reuters reports.

In New York, fashion designer Chirstian Siriano said his company would make as many masks as possible to donate to the city’s hospitals that are running dangerously low on supplies. Bernard Arnault, the head of LVMH and France’s richest man, and François Pinault, head of Kering, are business and philanthropic rivals. After the fire at Notre-Dame Cathedral in April last year, Arnault announced he was donating €200m to the rebuilding operation, doubling the €100m pledged by Pinault.

Updated at 1.11pm GMT 12.45pm GMT Russia may postpone vote on extension of Putin rule Russia may be forced to put off a public vote on amendments allowing Vladimir Putin to hold office until 2036, as the coronavirus threatens to upend a busy political season in Russia. The Kremlin so far has not rescheduled 22 April vote that was intended as a public endorsement for Putin’s surprise plan to “reset” his term limits, allowing him to run for a fifth and even sixth term as president under a revised constitution. But as Moscow and other Russian cities introduce stricter preventative measures against the coronavirus, election officials have discussed the possibility of home voting or other ways to pull off a nationwide plebiscite in a country of 140 million when health officials desperately want to reduce face-to-face contact. “The vote is set for 22 April, but the health of the country’s citizens is most important,” said Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Putin. “If the growth of the epidemiological situation gives cause to reschedule then it will be done.” 12.40pm GMT Summary Global coronavirus death toll passes 15,000 The number of people across the world who have died after contracting coronavirus stands at 15,308, according to Johns Hopkins University, which has been collating global data. The worldwide number of confirmed cases currently stands at 349,211. In Spain, one of Europe’s worst-hit countries, the coronavirus death toll has reached 2,182, the total growing by 462 overnight. The death toll in Iran from the new coronavirus has increased to 1,812, with 127 new deaths in 24 hours. Upwards curve in infections ‘may be flattening’ in Germany There were signs that the exponential upwards curve in new coronavirus infections in Germany is levelling off for the first time due to the strict social distancing measures in force, the head of the country’s public health institute has said. However, Lothar Wieler, the president of the Robert Koch Institute, urged caution, saying many health authorities had not yet submitted their data from the weekend. “I will only be able to confirm this trend definitively on Wednesday,” he said. But he said he remained optimistic. Postponement of Tokyo Olympics under consideration The head of the Japan Olympic committee (JOC) said on Monday he had to consider postponing the Games among his options amid increasing calls from committees around the world to delay the Olympics due to the coronavirus outbreak. “From the athletes’ point of view of safety and security, we have to come to a stage where we cannot help but consider things including postponement,” the JOC president, Yasuhiro Yamashita, told reporters on Monday. However, he said too long a delay would be a burden to athletes given the possibility of having to qualify again, for example. Britain warns tougher measures on movement may be on way Britain’s health minister has accused those still socialising of “very selfish” behaviour that risks the lives of NHS workers and others, as he signalled tougher restrictions on movement are likely to be on the way. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said stricter rules such as curfews or further closures could come into place “very soon” and urged people still socialising or going to holiday locations to “stop it, and if you don’t stop it then we’re going to have to take more measures.” French parliament votes for two-month ‘health state of emergency’ The move legalises the restrictive measures already taken – including the confinement introduced on 16 March – and gives the government power to legislate other emergency measures by decree. Indications are the French government will announce that the confinement to home regulations that were initially due to last two weeks, will be extended on Monday following recommendations from the country’s Covid-19 scientific committee. Markets slump as US Senate deadlocked over Covid-19 stimulus After stocks slumped in Asia overnight, European markets headed into a rocky start.

A government website has published lists divided by city, which give the names and addresses of those who are meant to be confined to their homes, either because they have returned to Montenegro from abroad or because they came into contact with someone later diagnosed with coronavirus. Criminal charges can be filed for those who break quarantine, but authorities said there was still a large number of people not complying. A statement on the website said the decision to publish names had been deemed preferable to enforcing a lockdown for the whole country. Montenegro’s first coronavirus cases were confirmed last week, making it one of the last European countries to declare a case. However, strict measures are already in place, including a ban on flights and the closure of restaurants, pubs and most shops. So far there are 22 confirmed cases in the small coastal country, with the first death from the virus announced on Monday morning, a 65-year-old man. 12.30pm GMT Japan’s Olympic organising committee plans to dramatically scale back the torch relay until a formal decision on the Games is made, public broadcaster NHK said on Monday.

The other was a 60-year-old general practitioner at a hospital in Saint-Avold near Metz, further north along the German frontier, according to the town’s mayor. Both died on Sunday when officials announced the death of a 67-year-old doctor who was among the first to treat coronavirus cases in the northern Oise department, which has been badly hit by the outbreak. 12.24pm GMT According to an AFP tally, more than one billion people around the world have now been asked to stay home in line with mandatory or recommended measures rolled out by governments trying to slow the tide of the pandemic.

Since 18 March, Belgian residents have only been allowed to go out for work deemed essential, visiting supermarkets or pharmacies, or to exercise while respecting 1.5 metres of social distancing. Asked how long the measures could last, health minister Maggie De Block said: That’s the million dollar question. We are now heading towards the peak of the epidemic, after which the curve will descend. I think this situation will last for at least another eight weeks. It would be the normal curve. She was speaking before Belgium’s federal crisis centre released its latest data on Monday, showing slowing growth in the number of people admitted to hospitals.

That’s just breaking on Reuters now. 11.03am GMT The Guardian’s Rome correspondent Angela Giuffrida has filed this detailed piece on what other countries may learn from the experience in Italy, where many people are struggling with the lockdown on daily life. A national lockdown came in on 10 March but the measures only really started to hit home a couple of days later, when bars, restaurants and other non-essential shops were closed across the country. The tone of the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, became clearer and more direct but also more humbling as time went on and he thanked Italians for the “great sacrifices” they were making for the common good, while repeating his call for people to stay at home. Sara Raginelli, a psychologist in Ancona, in the Marche region, said: “The moment the politics changed and started to speak in a more clear and direct way, people’s behaviour also changed and people developed more of an attitude of awareness. “The moment Italians were told to stay at home and rigid containment measures were introduced, the majority of the population complied.” Related: Italy struggled to convince citizens of coronavirus crisis. What can Europe learn? Updated at 11.44am GMT 10.51am GMT Sports fans must accept that it will be many months before packed crowds will be returning to watch live competition, writes Sean Ingle, the Guardian’s chief sports reporter. There’s a sense that many still do not “get it,” he writes, citing suggestions that the football season could be completed by mid‑July and that the Olympics could take place a week or two after. Over the weekend, he spoke to a leading expert, who is involved with the national response to the coronavirus pandemic, to ask him when sport as we know it – in front of packed crowds – might return. His response was sober and downbeat. My expectation is that this is something that is going to be around for a long period of time. There are no silver bullets on the horizon. We are talking months and months – and perhaps even next year and beyond. Related: Enough of this epic delusion: coronavirus makes sport in front of fans a long way off Updated at 11.44am GMT 10.41am GMT Germany: signs exponential growth curve of new infections levelling off for first time In Germany, there were signs that the exponential upwards curve in new coronavirus infections is levelling off for the first time due to the strict social distancing measures in force, the head of the country’s public health institute said on Monday. However, Lothar Wieler, the president of the Robert Koch Institute, urged caution, saying many health authorities had not yet submitted their data from the weekend. “I will only be able to confirm this trend definitively on Wednesday,” he said. But he said he remained optimistic. Germany has closed all its schools, and on Sunday ruled that no more than two people can gather at once, except for families or people sharing a household. Wieler said that current data on Germany´s Covid 19 cases indicates that the average age of those infected is 45, the average age of those who have died is 82. Fifty-seven per cent of those with confirmed infections have so far been men, 43% are women. Of the symptoms people have experienced, the most common is coughing (55%) and fever (40%). In his daily briefing, which has just ended, he appealed to German medical students to volunteer in the increasing effort to track all new cases, which he said continued to be an important part in the fight against the virus. A nationwide collection data point called Cosmos, which is gathering data on how the illness is being fought, shows a considerable increase in awareness of the virus, but still a considerable gap between awareness and behaviour, he said. Mobile phone data monitored anonymously at the weekend, of 30 million mobile phone users, showed that people have considerably reduced their mobility, but still not as much as was necessary, he said. Keeping a distance, regular hand washing and sneezing or coughing into the elbow still remained the most effective ways to avoid the spread of coronavirus, he added. “Keeping your distance is the order of the day,” he said. There are about 24,859 cases of coronavirus in Germany. There have so far been 97 reported deaths. Wieler responded to reports that Germany was not being upfront with the number of deaths owing to the fact the figure is relatively low compared with other countries. He confirmed that in Germany anyone who has died having been diagnosed with coronavirus is registered as having died from the virus, even if they had other illnesses, or medical complications. Meanwhile, Angela Merkel, who has been quarantined at home since yesterday after a doctor who administered a vaccine to her was tested positive for the virus, reportedly dialled in via telephone to the cabinet meeting of her government this morning. Updated at 10.55am GMT 10.20am GMT Norway plans UN donors fund for poorer states Amid mounting concern over the potential impact of coronavirus on poorer countries, Norway has announced that it plans to start a United Nations donors’ fund to assist in the effort. “We are concerned about the way the virus will affect developing countries which have fragile healthcare systems,” Norway’s development aid minister, Dag-Inge Ulstein, said in a statement. “International solidarity across borders is more important than ever. That’s why it is important for us to contribute financially to such a fund in the UN,” he added. The proposed fund would be similar to the 2014 response fund set up to counter the west African ebola outbreak. “We want to make sure that the efforts are as unified as possible and as early as possible so that we can answer up to the demands that countries will have, especially the poorest countries,” the foreign minister, Ine Eriksen Soereide, added. The initiative comes amid mounting concern over the mounting impact of the coronavirus on aid efforts in the world’s poorest countries already hard hit by border closures and restrictions on travel. The initiative has been welcomed favourably by the UN deputy secretary general, Amina Mohammed, Oslo said. On Thursday, the UN secretary general António Guterres warned “millions” of lives were at stake if the international community did not show solidarity, especially with the world’s poorest countries, amid the coronavirus outbreak. \uD83C\uDDF3\uD83C\uDDF4has initiated the creation of a\uD83C\uDD95 @UN multi-donor fund to assist developing countries'\uD83C\uDFE5systems in coping with the #CoronaCrisis ⚕️\uD83C\uDF0D \"Global solidarity is not only a moral imperative, it is in everyone's best interest\" -@antonioguterres #FlattenTheCurve #StaySafeHelpOthers pic.twitter.com/r7gGRaDHNN — UNDP Norway (@UNDPNorway) March 20, 2020 Updated at 10.48am GMT 10.02am GMT France could announce extended lockdown The French parliament has voted to introduce a two-month “health state of emergency”. This legalises the restrictive measures already taken – including the confinement introduced on 16 March – and gives the government power to legislate other emergency measures by decree. Indications are the French government will announce that the confinement to home regulations that were initially due to last two weeks, will be extended on Monday following recommendations from the country’s Covid-19 scientific committee. The council of state has been under pressure from medical unions to impose a “total confinement” on the population judging that the current restrictions are “too lax” and constitute a “serious and illegal attack on a fundamental freedom to life”. On Sunday, the council examined an official request, but decided to reject the demand for the moment. In its judgment it decided that a complete confinement to home would require food deliveries that it said “could not be organised across the country”. However, the council has given the government 48 hours to have another look at whether some movements should be proscribed, notably stopping people going out do practice an individual sport, mainly walking, jogging and running.

Updated at 10.50am GMT 9.48am GMT Too long a delay would burden athletes - Japanese Olympic chief There’s been pushback today from Japanese Olympic authorities at calls for a postponement of the games to later in the year. Too long of a delay would be a burden to athletes preparing for the Tokyo 2020 games, according to the president of the Japan Olympic Committee. Yasuhiro Yamashita made the comment at a news conference today in Japan as speculation deepened that Japan would be forced to delay the Olympics because of the widening coronavirus outbreak. That development came as Canada became the first country to warn that it won’t send its athletes to Tokyo unless they are postponed for a year. A man walks near a countdown display for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo, Monday, March 23, 2020. Photograph: Jae C Hong/AP The BBC meanwhile reported this morning that World Athletics president Sebastian Coe has written a letter to the International Olympic Committee expressing the “unanimous view” of athletics bodies that the games should be moved. The International Olympic Committee has paved the way for the Tokyo Games to be postponed after giving itself a four-week deadline to consider its options. While the IOC has emphatically ruled out cancelling the Olympics, it will consider a scaled down Games as well as delaying them for a few months or, more likely, a year. Only last week the IOC president, Thomas Bach, insisted that there was “No Plan B”, but it has since softened its stance amid mounting criticism by athletes amid the coronavirus crisis. The IOC will now examine several scenarios over the next month, but it is thought that deferring to the summer of 2021 is the most likely option.

The 68-year-old American has been placed in isolation at Wende correctional facility in New York state, said Michael Powers, the president of the state’s Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association. Powers said he learned the test came back positive on Sunday morning and was concerned about the corrections officers, who he said lack proper protective equipment. Several staff have been quarantined, Powers said. Weinstein arrived at Wende correctional facility, a maximum security prison east of Buffalo, on Wednesday after being housed at New York City’s Rikers Island jail. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison on 11 March for sexually assaulting the former production assistant Miriam Haley and raping a woman whom the Guardian is not naming because her wishes over identification are not clear.

Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP via Getty Images 9.23am GMT Delays in testing and giving people results are crippling Ireland’s response to coronavirus, fuelling fears of contagion despite social distancing measures. The waiting time for a test is four to five days, with several more days for results, according to the Health Service Executive (HSE), meaning people who suspect they have the disease are left in the dark for around a week. Around 40,000 people are waiting for a test, a backlog that hinders contact tracing and leaves healthcare workers who are in self-isolation, and potentially healthy, unable to work. Simon Harris, the health minister, told RTE on Monday that additional testing facilities were being opened across the country and that healthcare workers and other groups may be given priority testing until the backlog is cleared. The minister also warned of potential further closures of public amenities after crowds gathered at parks over weekends. The HSE confirmed 121 new cases on Sunday, raising Ireland’s total to 906. Northern Ireland reported 20 cases, bringing its total to 128. A nursing home and a direct provision centre which hosts asylum seekers have reported infections, fuelling fears of rapid contagion among vulnerable people who cannot easily self-isolate.

On Sunday, the regional government of the southeastern region of Murcia announced “the total shutdown of the region, except for minimal services”. It was rebuked by the central government, which said such an order could be given only by the health minister.”The Spanish government continues to follow the WHO’s recommendations at all times and reiterates that it has adopted the strictest measures on Europe and some of the strictest globally when it comes to beating the coronavirus,” the central government said in a statement.” We once again appeal for unity between administrations and stress out constant willingness to co-ordinate and collaborate with autonomous regions in the fight against the pandemic.” Updated at 9.29am GMT 9.02am GMT Afghanistan has reported six new Coronavirus cases, raising the total number to 40. Three of the new cases are reported in the western province of Herat, which raised the total number in the most affected part of Afghanistan to 21. Herat neighbours Iran and concerns are high in the war torn country as around 15 thousands Afghans come from Iran each day. Wahidullah Mayar, spokesman for Afghanisatan’s health ministry, said officials asked the government to quarantine Herat province but he added that no steps have been taken so far. In a press conference, Mayar showed pictures of empty streets of France, Italy and India and asked people to stay at home. Last week was the new solar year eve and thousands of people in Herat and across the country went out. Mayar warned that if things go on with “current state of condition, we will have a catastrophe and in that case heath ministry is not responsible”.

Matt Hancock said stricter rules such as curfews or constraints on movement could come into place “very soon” and urged people still socialising or going to holiday locations to “stop it, and if you don’t stop it then we’re going to have to take more measures”. He took a much tougher line than the prime minister on those defying social distancing rules, saying people carrying on as usual were being “incredibly unfair to go and socialise in the way we have seen”.

Rail franchise agreements are to be suspended to avoid train companies collapsing due to the coronavirus, the Department for Transport (DfT) has announced. Operators will be paid a small management fee to run services, with all revenue and cost risk transferred to the Government. The emergency measures will be in place for an initial period of six months. Rail timetables have been slashed because of Covid-19. The DfT said passenger numbers have fallen by up to 70%, while ticket sales are down by two-thirds. The move is coming as no surprise to critics of Britain’s highly privatised model, and many expect there will be no return.

Only mosque employees will be able to continue to pray on the esplanade outside the mosque, Sunday’s statement added. Jordan is the custodian of the compound, known by Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif, or Holy Sanctuary, and Temple Mount by Jews, which includes the Al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock.

Photograph: China Daily/Reuters Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak in China, has begun to loosen its two-month lockdown on citizens as more countries issued new restrictions to contain the pandemic. On Monday, small groups of residents in the central Chinese city were leaving their residential compounds, going to grocery stores and walking along the streets for the first time in weeks. At the weekend, the first train arrived in the city ferrying more than 1,000 workers from elsewhere in the province back to the city for work. On Sunday, local authorities said residents could begin returning to work if they did not have a temperature and could provide a green health code, signifying their virus-free status as well as a certificate from their employer. Officials said the city would be “gradually” reopened and public transportation would resume. Non-residents, those stranded in Wuhan since the stringent travel restrictions went into effect on 23 January, could also begin applying to leave the city, city authorities said.

Ear, nose and throat surgeons say losing your sense of smell could be used as a key clinical indicator in otherwise symptom-free carriers of Covid-19. “It is these silent carriers who may remain undetected by current screening procedures, which may explain why the disease has progressed so rapidly in so many countries around the world,” professor at Australia’s Flinders University and ENT specialist Simon Carney told AAP. “While further research is required, loss of smell, or anosmia, has been reported in as many as one in three patients in South Korea and in Germany, this figure was as high as one in two.” An ENT professor in London also reported a dramatic increase in patients with anosmia as their only symptom of Covid-19 infection. He said doctors and COVID-19 detection centres could use the subtle sign as part of their testing criteria and patients should also consider calling their GP if they notice this symptom. Utah Jazz player Rudy Gobert, who recently tested positive for Covid-19, says his experience backs this up: Just to give you guys an update, loss of smell and taste is definitely one of the symptoms, haven’t been able to smell anything for the last 4 days.

As new restrictions closing non-essential services came into effect, there were clear signs of economic and social stress with long queues forming outside offices of the main welfare agency across the country. After reporting only a gradual spread in January, the number of Covid-19 cases in Australia now appears to be tracking the much sharper increases seen elsewhere with the most populous states of New South Wales and Victoria recording the fastest rises. Most states have now closed their borders to travellers from other parts of the country and effected their own lockdown laws, in addition to the national curbs announced on Sunday.

Confirmed coronavirus cases have risen sharply in New York as both the state governor, Andrew Cuomo, and Mayor Bill de Blasio, called for urgent and better assistance from the federal government. The city has over 15,000 confirmed cases as of Sunday afternoon, up from 4,812 since Saturday. The growth is due, in part, to the rapid expansion of testing but also due to the accelerated growth of the virus throughout the city. On Sunday evening the city faced shutdown after Cuomo, on Friday, ordered the shutdown of all non-essential businesses in the state. Except for essential services, all New Yorkers are now ordered to stay indoors from 8pm Sunday evening. By Sunday the state of New York accounted for half the country’s 30,000 cases nationwide.

The head of the New York state corrections officers union confirmed late on Sunday that the former movie producer, who is serving a prison sentence for sexual assault and rape, has tested positive for the Covid-19. China saw a drop in its daily tally of new coronavirus cases, reversing four straight days of higher figures, as the capital Beijing ramped up measures to contain the number of infections arriving from abroad. Canada said it will not send athletes to Tokyo Olympics, New Zealand said it would consider boycotting Tokyo 2020 and Australia told its olympic athletes to prepare for the games to be held next year, in 2021 – all in the wake of Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, saying postponement could be an option. New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced the entire country should prepare for self isolation, as the country prepares to move to the highest alert level later this week. Nearly one in three Americans was under orders on Sunday to stay home to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic as Ohio, Louisiana and Delaware became the latest states to enact broad restrictions, Reuters reports. A European clinical trial involving some 3,200 people has been launched to test four possible experimental coronavirus treatments.

Photograph: REX/Shutterstock When reporter Jon Cohen says: You stood nearby while President Trump was in the Rose Garden shaking hands with people. You’re a doctor. You must have had a reaction like, Sir, please don’t do that. Dr Fauci replies: “I keep saying, is there any way we can get a virtual press conference. Thus far, no. But when you’re dealing with the White House, sometimes you have to say things 1,2,3,4 times, and then it happens. So I’m going to keep pushing.” Pressed on Trump’s claims that China was “very secretive” and should have informed people of the outbreak three to four months earlier, Dr Fauci replies: “I know, but what do you want me to do? I mean, seriously Jon, let’s get real, what do you want me to do?” Dr Fauci continues: “I told the appropriate people, it doesn’t comport, because two or three months earlier would have been September. The next time they sit down with him and talk about what he’s going to say, they will say, by the way, Mr. President, be careful about this and don’t say that. But I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down. OK, he said it. Let’s try and get it corrected for the next time.” Dr Fauci also gives insight into Trump’s coronavirus press conference ‘creative process’, as it were: “We go in to see the president, we present [our consensus] to him and somebody writes a speech. Then he gets up and ad libs on his speech. And then we’re up there to try and answer questions.” Asked about the viral moment when Fauci covered his mouth to hide a smirk following Trump’s reference to the “deep State Department,” conspiracy theory, Fauci responds: “no comment”.

Last week, president, Joko Widodo, acknowledged the need to immediately ramp up testing and said that he would introduce drive-through tests. The number of tests carried out has increased significantly from the 220 completed earlier this month, leading to a rise in identified cases. The country has recorded 48 deaths, prompting speculation that the number of cases is far higher than the 514 infections that have been officially recorded. 3.16am GMT Harvey Weinstein tests positive for coronavirus Harvey Weinstein has tested positive for Coronavirus, Reuters reports.

Several staff have been quarantined, Powers said. Weinstein arrived at Wende Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison east of Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday after being housed at New York City’s Rikers Island jail. A lawyer for Weinstein said on Sunday night that his legal team had not been notified of the coronavirus diagnosis. “Given Mr. Weinstein’s state of health, we are of course concerned, if this is the case, and we are vigilantly monitoring the situation,” said lawyer Imran Ansari, who is based in New York.

The official said he could not comment on any individual prisoner’s medical record. 3.11am GMT Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, refused US assistance to fight the new coronavirus on Sunday citing an unfounded conspiracy theory claiming the virus could be man-made by America. Iran has the sixth-highest number of confirmed cases worldwide, with 21,638, according to Johns Hopkins university. Khamenei’s comments come as Iran faces crushing US sanctions blocking the country from selling its crude oil and accessing international financial markets. Iranian civilian officials in recent days have increasingly criticised those sanctions, while Khamenei instead chose to traffic in the same conspiracy theory increasingly used by Chinese officials, AP reports, to deflect blame for the pandemic.

In contrast, 257 patients were released from hospitals where they had been isolated for treatment, the KCDC said. South Korea posted more recoveries than new infections on March 13 for the first time since its first case was confirmed on 20 January. 2.43am GMT Over to Hong Kong now, where authorities are searching for 36 people who have skipped out on mandatory home quarantine. Anyone arriving in Hong Kong must spend 14 days in home quarantine, unless they have come from Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk-do in Korea, Iran, or the Italian regions of Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy and Veneto, in which case they must go to a government quarantine centre. Authorities have also begun issuing tracking bracelets for all international arrivals. The wristbands, which connect to an app on the holders phone, send alerts to police and health authorities if the holder removes the wristband or leaves their building. On Sunday the government said police had tracked down five people who had left their buildings without permission. Two had removed their wristbands. All five were taken to government quarantine centres and now face potential prosecution. Police were investigating another 36 cases of people leaving their designated address without permission. Under Hong Kong law anyone breaching home quarantine orders faces fines of up to $25,000HKD (US$3220) or six months in prison. The Government said in a statement it strongly condemned anyone intending to breach quarantine orders. “Such actions increase the risk of community transmission and will negatively impact the health of others and the public at-large.” Hong Kong, which kept the infection rate low despite its proximity and connections to mainland China, has seen a rise in cases as students and citizens rushed home in recent weeks. It has reported 317 confirmed cases, and four deaths. 2.33am GMT Argentina has announced a fixed sum for self-employed and independent workers who are being left without their livelihood because of the country’s general lockdown to halt the spread of coronavirus.

Australian Team Chef de Mission for Tokyo Ian Chesterman says: It’s clear the Games can’t be held in July.

Australia has told its athletes to prepare for the olympics to be held next year, in 2021, the ABC reports. AOC chief executive Matt Caroll said in a statement: “We have athletes based overseas, training at central locations around Australia as teams and managing their own programs. With travel and other restrictions this becomes an untenable situation”. “The IOC had adopted the key principles of putting athlete health first and ensuring it acted in their best interests and the interests of sport. This decision reflects those principles. “We are now in a position where we can plan with greater certainty.” Updated at 2.11am GMT 2.00am GMT Back to the Olympics now: New Zealand Olympic Committee president Mike Stanley has said the country would consider boycotting the olympics. Earlier today, Stanley published an open letter in which he wrote, “Athletes need a safe, and fair, playing field to compete and, right now, the widespread and evolving impact of Covid-19 is not allowing that to happen,” and urged the International Olympic Committee to “finalise their decision as soon as possible, bringing clarity to our sports and athletes.” A few hours later, following the news that Japan was considering postponing the games, Stanley told Newshub that, the news organisation writes, “postponement is the only way to go,” and that if the IOC does not postpone the Tokyo Olympics, New Zealand would consider boycotting the games. Updated at 2.01am GMT 1.53am GMT The time of coronavirus is strange indeed – I for one never thought I would feel relieved to learn that car traffic anywhere is increasing, but as my colleague Lily Kuo just reported, enough Beijingers headed to work this morning that the city’s streets were at least somewhat jammed – and that’s a good thing. 1.48am GMT China latest figures We have the latest figures from China now, which saw a drop in its daily tally of new coronavirus cases, reversing four straight days of higher figures, as the capital Beijing ramped up measures to contain the number of infections arriving from abroad.

Photograph: Betsy Joles/Getty Images On Monday, China reported 39 new cases from the previous day, all of which were from imported cases, according to the National Health Commission. On Sunday, China ordered that all international flights to Beijing will be diverted to other cities where passengers will be screened before continuing on to the capital. Authorities in Wuhan are loosening restrictions. Residents can now leave the city if they have a green health code, issued through an app. Those stuck in Wuhan over the last two months may now leave if they are screened and get a health certificate from local authorities. Residents and community volunteers can now enter grocery shops but are required to present electronic health codes, from their smartphones, have their temperature tested and register their names. Other signs of life returning to normal in China include Beijing seeing early morning Monday before work traffic. Several provinces have announced dates for when students will go back to school. 1.38am GMT In a press release, the Canadian Olympic Committee and Canadian Paraolympic committee called “urgently” for the games to be postponed for one year. “While we realize the inherent complexities around a postponement, nothing is more important than the health and safety of our athletes and the world community,” it said. “This is not solely about athlete health - it is about public health.” RELEASE: The Canadian Olympic Committee and Canadian Paralympic Committee have made the difficult decision to not send Canadian teams to the Olympic and Paralympic Games in the summer of 2020: https://t.co/HyOBA5wwp4 pic.twitter.com/x9OWABVxMA — Team Canada PR (@TeamCanadaPR) March 23, 2020 Updated at 1.40am GMT 1.35am GMT The announcement from Canada comes as Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, hinted that postponing the Tokyo Olympics could be an option if the coronavirus pandemic made it impossible to hold the Games this summer and with the full quota of athletes and spectators. It is the first time that Abe has publicly conceded that the timing of the Games, which are due to open on 24 July, may have to change, as more athletes and sports federations added their voices to calls for a postponement. Cancellation, however, is not among the options, Abe said, echoing the position of the International Olympic Committee [IOC], which said on Sunday that it was drawing up alternative scenarios for the Games but was not considering calling them off. If holding the Olympics in its complete form “becomes impossible, we may have no option but to consider postponing the Games, given the Olympics’ principle of putting the health of athletes first,” he told parliament on Monday. The IOC is expected to take up to a month to reach a decision. “These scenarios relate to modifying existing operational plans for the Games to go ahead on 24 July 2020, and also for changes to the start date of the Games,” it said in a statement. “The IOC will ... start detailed discussions to complete its assessment of the rapid development of the worldwide health situation and its impact on the Olympic Games, including the scenario of postponement. The IOC is confident that it will have finalised these discussions within the next four weeks.” 1.33am GMT Canada will not send athletes to Tokyo Olympics Away from New Zealand now to Canada, where the Canadian olympic committee has just announced that it will not send athletes to Tokyo 2020. 1.26am GMT Some reaction now to the announcement.

We're going to get each other though \uD83D\uDC9A https://t.co/gTACuEJHG7 — Golriz Ghahraman (@golrizghahraman) March 23, 2020 1.19am GMT Below is an explainer on what New Zealand’s Covid-19 alert levels mean, from the NZ government website. In short, Level four (“eliminate”), which New Zealand will go up to on Tuesday, means it is “Likely that disease is not contained.” The listed response measures include: People instructed to stay at home Educational facilities closed Businesses closed except for essential services (e.g. supermarkets, pharmacies, clinics) and lifeline utilities Rationing of supplies and requisitioning of facilities Travel severely limited Major reprioritisation of healthcare services The full PDF is here, or you can check the official site here. New Zealand coronavirus alert levels. Photograph: supplied Updated at 1.21am GMT 1.11am GMT Just to summarise the latest from New Zealand now, where prime minister Jacinda Ardern has just concluded a press conference announcing that the country should prepare to go into self isolation. Ardern said: Medical modelling suggests that without the measures announced today, tens of thousands of people in the country will die. The country will move to a higher alert level – a three out of four – for the next 48 hours before the highest level of four is deployed, essentially shutting down the country. All non-essential businesses are to close, schools will be closed from tomorrow, and domestic travel restrictions will be in place. The level four restrictions will be in place for at least four weeks. Supermarkets, pharmacies and essential medical services will stay open. And news from earlier today: There were 36 new cases of coronavirus registered by 8am this morning. The New Zealand opposition party suspended all election campaigning amidst the coronavirus crisis. 1.06am GMT “I do not underestimate what I am asking New Zealanders to do. It is huge,” Ardern said of the decision to put the country into self isolation and close non-essential services. “The worst-case scenario is simply intolerable, it would represent the greatest loss of New Zealanders’ lives in our history and I will not take that chance.” She said it was important that New Zealanders followed the rules by not going to the park to see a friend or to have lunch with a family member. Ardern said she had no doubt that the measures would cause “unprecedented economic and social disruption, but they are necessary”. Her final message to people was: “Be kind, I understand that people will want to act as enforcers, I understand that; people are anxious.” But she said the government would act as the enforcer of these measures. She encouraged people to go home tonight, to check on their neighbours, to set up a phone tree with their street to check their wellbeing. Updated at 4.47am GMT 1.05am GMT Still in New Zealand for now, prime minister Jacinda Ardern says that medical modelling suggests that without the measures announced today, tens of thousands of people in the country will die. 12.59am GMT New Zealand announces move to lockdown in 48 hours New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern just announced the country would move to a higher alert level – a three out of four – for the next 48 hours before the highest level of four is deployed, essentially shutting down the country. All non-essential businesses are to close, schools will be closed from tomorrow, and domestic travel restrictions will be in place. The level four restrictions will be in place for at least four weeks. Supermarkets, pharmacies and essential medical services will stay open. “We are all now preparing as a nation to go into self-isolation,” Ardern said. “Staying at home is essential.” Updated at 4.17am GMT 12.59am GMT In New Zealand, prime minister Jacinda Ardern has said that in 48-hours’ time, the country will move to the highest alert level. Earlier on Monday, director general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said there were 36 new cases of coronavirus registered by 8am this morning, bringing the country’s total to 102 cases. 12.57am GMT New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern says the country must prepare to go into self-isolation, and that schools will close on Tuesday. Ardern also raised the nationwide alert level to level three, effective immediately. This is breaking now, we’ll have more very shortly, so do stay tuned. Updated at 1.02am GMT 12.41am GMT British musicians have already lost an estimated £13.9m (US$16m) in earnings because of coronavirus, according to a Musicians’ Union survey. The organisation, which has 32,000 members and is the main trade union for the sector in the UK, surveyed its members over the impact of the outbreak, and received more than 4,100 responses. Ninety per cent of respondents said their income had already been affected. Related: UK musicians lose £13.9m in earnings so far due to coronavirus 12.39am GMT In the US, Donald Trump attempted to blunt growing criticism of the stalled federal response to the coronavirus crisis on Sunday night, promising that more help was on the way for states suffering a critical shortage of medical equipment, hospital beds and testing facilities. As the death toll from Covid-19 in the US rose to 417, with more than 33,000 cases reported nationwide, increasing numbers of state and city leaders fired off warnings to the White House that a tipping point was near. Warnings were particularly strong from New York, where cases have risen sharply past 15,000 and now account for around half of those in the US.

Related: Coronavirus: at a glance 12.34am GMT New Zealand election campaigning suspended The New Zealand opposition party has suspended all election campaigning amid the coronavirus crisis, saying the priority is now on supporting and working with the government in emergency efforts to clamp down on the spread of the virus. “I have offered the Prime Minister my full support during this crisis, providing they move expeditiously enough. We will work in a supportive and constructive way in the interests of New Zealanders,” said National Party leader Simon Bridges in a statement. “I have also offered the Government the services of our MPs and staff to assist where we can. “We want to do all we can to protect the lives and livelihoods of New Zealanders.” Bridges said he had been “inundated” with calls from doctors, scientists and health professionals, and strongly believed the country needed to be moved to alert level 4 - a total shutdown, as seen in Italy, France and Spain. Bridges had expressed this message to prime minister Jacinda Ardern. “We won’t regret moving quickly to stop this virus spreading. We may have regrets if we don’t. “We will support the Government where we can. But we won’t always agree and we will continue to let the Government know when we don’t. “The Opposition will continue to play an important role to ensure the best decisions are being made in the interests of all New Zealanders. We won’t be campaigning for the foreseeable future, however.” Updated at 4.43pm GMT 12.28am GMT Here is the latest from the US now (thanks to our colleagues at the helm of the US live blog, which has now closed): The number of Covid-19 cases in the US has now gone past 33,000, with 417 deaths. New York is a hotspot for the virus, accounting for 5% of cases worldwide. Rand Paul has become the first US senator to test positive for Covid-19. The national guard have been deployed to New York, Washington and California to help with the outbreak in those states. Democrats have blocked an economic stimulus package, claiming it favored big business over the rights of workers. Updated at 12.28am GMT 12.25am GMT Jack Ma, the founder of China’s e-commerce giant Alibaba, has sent more than six million medical items to Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa. The supplies will be distributed to African countries in need of supplies to battle the spreading Covid-19 pandemic, AP reports. An Ethiopian Airlines cargo flight from Guangzhou, China arrived with 5.4 million face masks, 1.08 million testing kits, 40,000 sets of protective clothing and 60,000 protective face shields, according to Ethiopian officials and the Jack Ma Foundation. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed last week pledged to distribute the supplies to other countries in Africa. Ma has sent similar shipments of medical supplies to countries in Asia, Europe, North America and Latin America.

Abe also told parliament that cancelling the Games was not an option. On Saturday, crowds gathered to see the Olympic flame in Tokyo, despite coronavirus concerns.

Photograph: 山本毅/AP Updated at 12.19am GMT 12.14am GMT In New Zealand, the director general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said there were 36 new cases of coronavirus registered by 8am this morning, bringing the country’s total to 102 cases. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern will hold a press conference in 30 minutes and reveal more about the nation’s alert level. Dr Bloomfield hinted the country may move up a level, as two cases of the virus had not been ruled out as community transmission. There are four alert levels in New Zealand and the country is currently at level 2 - containing the virus. Level four would mean the entire country shut down, except for health and essential services. “Of the cases today over half are directly related to overseas travel, most of the remainder are close contacts of a previously confirmed case or associated with an event where there were confirmed cases such as the Queenstown World Hereford Cattle conference,” Dr Bloomfield said. “More than 1,100 laboratory tests were carried out yesterday, bringing the total number of completed tests to over 7400.” “Most of our cases are still from people who have travelled to NZ from overseas.” Updated at 4.39pm GMT 12.12am GMT The Australian market plunged more than 8% on Monday morning amid uncertainty over the effects of a shutdown of hospitality and entertainment operators announced by prime minister Scott Morrison on Sunday night. Monday’s losses are on top of more than a month of coronavirus-inspired selling that has already cut the value of Australian shares by a third. Before the market opened, gambling company Tabcorp said its totalisator outlets and on-course betting, both of which are to be shut, accounted for about 28% of its revenue. With this money now set to be ripped away, the company said it withdrew its previous profit guidance. A raft of companies temporarily halted trade in their shares to give them time to respond to the new restrictions, including Star Entertainment, which operates Sydney’s casino, and Retail Food Group, which is the franchisor of fast food outlets including Gloria Jean’s coffee shops and pizza joints Pizza Capers and Crust. Village Roadshow said it was closing Gold Coast theme parks Warner Bros. Movie World, Sea World, Wet’n’Wild and Paradise Country, but Sea World would remain open because it has a hotel. Airline Virgin Australia, which along with rival Qantas has already slashed flights as travel restrictions bite, said it “expects a material reduction in its domestic capacity as a result” of new travel bans announced by state and federal authorities over the weekend. 12.11am GMT In Australia the following types of businesses will all be forcibly closed within the next hour, the federal government has announced: Pubs, registered and licensed clubs (excluding bottle shops attached to these venues), hotels (excluding accommodation) Gyms and indoor sporting venues Cinemas, entertainment venues, casinos, and night clubs Restaurants and cafes will only be able to serve takeaway. Religious gatherings, places of worship or funerals (in enclosed spaces and other than very small groups and where the 1 person per 4 square metre rule applies). A few minutes ago, Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison addressed the country, saying “Australians would be living with this virus for at least the next six months. It could be longer.” There is no short-term solution to this. We have to steel ourselves for the next six months and work together to slow the spread in order to save lives, to protect the elderly and vulnerableAustralians. On social media, people are posting pictures of the queues are forming at Centrelink, the national body that delivers social security services and other payments: Centrelink Canberra.

It will slow this invader so our healthcare system ... will have time to treat casualties.” Ohio has 351 cases and three deaths, while Louisiana has 837 cases and 20 deaths, several in a senior-care facility. Louisiana has the third highest number of cases per capita and saw a 10-fold increase in cases in the past week, Governor John Bel Edwards said. Ohio’s order will go into effect at midnight EDT on Monday and stay in effect until April 6. Louisiana’s order goes into effect at 5 p.m. CDT on Monday and lasts through April 12. Delaware’s order starts at 8 a.m. EDT on Tuesday. In Kentucky, non-essential businesses must close by 8 p.m. EDT on Monday but authorities stopped short of ordering residents to stay home. 11.57pm GMT Summary Hi, this Helen Sullivan. I’ll bringing you key developments in the coronavirus pandemic for the next few hours, as we navigate a crisis that has seen around one billion people worldwide confined to their homes. As the virus continues to spread, governments are introducing stricter isolation measures and enforcement procedures, as well as financial plans in an attempt weaken its economic impact. A European clinical trial involving some 3,200 people has been launched to test four possible experimental coronavirus treatments. First cases of the virus have been confirmed in Syria, as well as Grenada and Mozambique. About 1.5 million UK residents who are particularly vulnerable to coronavirus will be contacted by the NHS and advised to stay at home for 12 weeks. There have been 48 new deaths in the UK and 112 in France. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has gone into quarantine after a doctor who gave her a vaccine tests positive for coronavirus. Germany has banned meetings of over two people, they are about work on slowing the spread of the coronavirus. 23 people have died and 83 have been left injured in overnight prison riots in Bogota as inmates demanded better protection against contamination. The death toll in the northern region of Lombardy rose by around 360 in a day to more than 3,450. The area has borne the brunt of Italy’s virus outbreak. Spain will ask parliament to extend the state of emergency for another 15 days until April 11. Dubai carrier Emirates reversed a previous announcement suspending all passenger flights, saying it is going to continue flying to 13 destinations, including the the U.S., the UK, Japan, Australia and Canada.

Related: Coronavirus live news: Trump says China could have stopped virus as global cases pass 3 million 12.05am BST New Zealand has ended its strictest lockdown phase and entered Level 3, with 400,000 Kiwis returning to work, takeaways open, and fishing, surfing and swimming permitted. Local media reported lines outside McDonald’s drive-through from 3am on Tuesday morning, and by 10am the food app Regulr – which many local cafes and restaurants are using to allow pick-ups – had crashed nationwide. Fast-food chains such as Dominos and Hells Pizza have warned customers to expect signficant delays as demand surges, and hired hundreds of extra employees to cope with the rush, and deliver food. NZ Domino’s general manager Cameron Toomey said “zero contact delivery”, more frequent hygiene and sanitisation practices, and physical distancing and temperature testing were now underway in all their stores, and essential workers would have priorities for pizza. Updated at 1.20pm GMT 11.57pm BST In that press conference Trump also said that he believed China “could have stopped” the coronavirus and that the US would conduct “serious investigations” into the outbreak. As Reuters report, Trump said: “We are doing very serious investigations ... We are not happy with China. “We believe it could have been stopped at the source. It could have been stopped quickly and it wouldn’t have spread all over the world.” Earlier, the director-general of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the “world should have listened” to the WHO. He said the agency sounded the highest level of alarm over the novel coronavirus early on, but that not all countries heeded its advice. 11.44pm BST Trump’s briefing has now ended. 11.36pm BST Trump was asked whether he has any information about Kim Jong Un’s health, which has been the subject of rumors and speculation in recent days. He says: “I can’t tell you exactly. Yes, I do have a very good idea but I can’t talk about it now.” 11.28pm BST Vice President Mike Pence appears to be arguing that the administration actually met its goals because millions of test kits were distributed, even though they were not given and processed. That is quite an argument. 11.25pm BST We’re hearing a lot about very large numbers of tests that will be done during the month of May. But it’s worth remembering that we have heard big promises in the past about testing, such as the big promises of drive-through testing run by Google, that have yet to materialize. 11.18pm BST Asked if he takes any responsibility for reports of people ingesting disinfectant after his own remarks, Trump says: “No, I don’t.” 11.17pm BST We’ve moved on to questions from the press. A reporter asks why HHS secretary Alex Azar hasn’t been fired. Trump says it’s an unfair question and attacks Democratic politicians. Trump has previously denied reports he planned to fire Azar. 11.13pm BST Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is now discussing an eight-part plan for testing. Apparently we are on step eight. pic.twitter.com/1vdUAYfJSf — Julia Carrie Wong (@juliacarriew) April 27, 2020 Updated at 11.17pm BST 11.11pm BST We also heard from Krogers, Walmart and Rite-Aid. Now we’re back to the president. Trump spoke again about testing, and has introduced the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, Dr Deborah Birx, to discuss a “blueprint” for states to expand testing. Updated at 11.29pm BST 11.09pm BST The chief executive of CVS Health just announced that the pharmacy chain will expand testing to 1,000 CVS facilities in May. For context, there are nearly 10,000 CVS locations across the US, so this means that approximately one out of 10 CVS locations will have testing capacity by next month. Next is the Walgreens boss, who says they will triple testing capacity, but does not provide hard numbers. 11.08pm BST Trump spoke briefly and generally about the pandemic before introducing a group of chief executives. We’ve identified the first up as the Quest Diagnostics boss, Steve Rusckowski, who boasted that his company is now running 50,000 tests per day. Updated at 11.30pm BST 10.42pm BST In Washington, the US president Donald Trump has just come out to start his briefing, alongside the vice-president Mike Pence. 10.40pm BST Meanwhile, experts are calling on the government to more than double the level of Germany’s current testing levels before it considers loosening restrictions. Germany has the capacity to carry out up to 818,000 tests every week, according to Helge Braun, the head of Merkel’s chancellery, but advisers have said that figure should rise to 2 million. Increasing the test capacity enables a detailed picture of the pandemic’s progress and helps form a basis for the evaluation of possible relaxation measures by the government. Whilst many countries have looked in admiration at Germany’s ability to carry out large-scale tests, the constant question being asked within the country is: Why is there not more testing? 10.38pm BST The president of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble, waded into the debate in a provocative way with his comments to the Sunday newspaper Der Tagesspiegel. He said Germany needed to better weigh up the social and economic costs with the desire to save lives, and decisions should not be left just to virologists. The massive economic, social, psychological and other effects need to be weighed up. To just bring everything to a halt for two years can also have horrific consequences. Schäuble said he did not believe the first clause in the German constitution, “human dignity is inviolable”, meant preserving human lives at all costs. The clause anchored in the basic law “does not exclude that we must die”, he said. He stressed that, while the state should provide the best possible medical care for everyone, “people will continue to die of coronavirus”. Schäuble warned that the mood in the nation was in danger of tipping if the restrictions stayed in place for too long. “It will be harder, the longer it lasts,” he said. Updated at 10.50pm BST 10.35pm BST German politicians are locked in a row over how and when to relax restrictions amid grave concern expressed by Angela Merkel and leading scientific figures that the country is in danger of gambling away the advantages it has gained. By Monday evening, there were 158,391 confirmed infections and there had been 6,088 deaths. Germany has done well on testing and contact tracing, as well as on boosting the number of its intensive care beds. Its death rate is quite a lot lower than that of other countries. But there are increasing references to the so-called ‘prevention paradox’ – by slowing down the virus’s spread, the impression many have is that the dangers have been exaggerated and isn’t it, therefore, about time the country got back to normal? Updated at 10.40pm BST 10.06pm BST Argentina has banned all commercial flight ticket sales until September, one of the toughest travel bans in the world. While the country’s borders have been closed since March, the new decree goes further by banning the sale and purchase of commercial flights to, from and within Argentina. Industry figures have claimed it will put too much strain on airlines and airports. The decree, signed by the National Civil Aviation Administration, said it was “understood to be reasonable” to implement the restrictions, without elaborating. 9.18pm BST The chairman of the English Premier League club Watford has said a resumption of top-level football should be off the agenda until the burden on the NHS has become less severe, adding that he does not think “football is important at the moment”. Before the meeting of Premier League executives scheduled for Friday, and with the Bundesliga lined up to be the first major league to restart after a coronavirus lockdown, Scott Duxbury said: I feel uncomfortable at this stage even talking about football because there are people dying every day, there are stresses on the NHS, and that has to be the priority. Do I want to resume football? Absolutely, and when it’s safe and the government says it’s fine and all the players and support staff that follow football can return, then I’m 100% behind that. But at the moment I feel all efforts have to be on beating the pandemic and supporting the NHS. Related: Football must not restart until strain on NHS eases, says Watford chairman 9.12pm BST Flaunting World Health Organization (WHO) guidance, Chile’s top health official has claimed a patient recovered from Covid-19 has little chance of contracting the disease again for at least three months. The WHO maintains there is scant evidence for such claims. Chile is preparing to roll out some of the world’s first “release certificates” for recovered patients this week. Health officials say they are not “immunity cards” but have previously suggested they will indicate some degree of resistance to the disease. The health minister, Jaime Mañalich, said he and UN health agency officials have met and agreed there is no way to guarantee immunity. But he cited data from China and South Korea that point to shorter-term protection for those who survive the disease. The probability that a person becomes ill again, or that someone else becomes ill, becomes very remote. How long? A minimum of three months. Updated at 9.49pm BST 8.55pm BST Jordan has eased restrictions on movement aimed at containing the outbreak and allowed more businesses to reopen to help jump-start the cash-strapped economy, officials have said. As of Wednesday, residents of the capital, Amman, can drive private vehicles between 8am and 6pm, in the first such move since a nationwide curfew nearly 40 days ago that ordered the country’s population of 10 million to stay at home. Public transport and taxi services will also now resume with passenger restrictions and compulsory wearing of face masks and gloves, said government spokesman Amjad Adailah. Updated at 8.59pm BST 8.45pm BST Amazon will extend the closure of its six warehouses in France to 5 May after a court rejected the US online retailer’s appeal against a ruling that restricts what it can deliver during the crisis. The company said it continues to “assess the best way to operate given the decision of the Court of Appeal [in Versailles]”. Updated at 8.48pm BST 8.32pm BST Nigeria to ease restrictions Nigeria will begin a “phased and gradual” easing of more than four weeks of lockdown at the beginning of next week, its president Muhammadu Buhari has said. Lagos and Ogun states, and the federal capital territory of Abuja, entered lockdown to tame the spread of the virus on 30 March. Updated at 9.52pm BST 8.30pm BST Ireland’s national public health emergency team will not recommend easing its lockdown next Tuesday unless progress on the spread and impact of the virus is made this week, the chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, has said. Some countries have announced such measures and Holohan raised hopes Ireland would join them next week when he said on 16 April the country had contained the first wave of the outbreak. However, he has said improvements in the number of new cases, in hospitalisations, and in admissions to intensive care units have slowed down. Ireland’s caretaker government has adopted the advice of Holohan’s team in full to date. I was saying that if the assessment was being made towards the end of last week, we wouldn’t be recommending that we had arrived at a point where we would be lifting those restrictions. If anything, I’m more firmly of that view given what we’re seeing. We’re seeing a persistent admission rate to intensive care units, we’d like to see that number come down. We’re still reporting a significant number of cases and we still have a significant challenge in healthcare facilities ... We’re still seeing improvement, but it’s slowed down. Updated at 9.42pm BST 8.17pm BST The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 957,875 cases and said the number of deaths has risen to 53,922. Over the weekend, the CDC updated its case count to 928,619 and said 52,459 people have died across the country as of 26 April, but that the numbers are preliminary and had not been confirmed by individual states. 8.12pm BST French researchers are preparing to launch a human trial to test their hypothesis that nicotine can help the body combat the infection, Reuters reports. The trial will involve groups of healthcare workers and patients wearing nicotine patches and other groups wearing placebo patches. Then they will be tested to see if there is a difference in how their bodies respond to the virus. The trial is a follow-up to a French study, published this month, of public health data which appeared to show that people who smoke are 80% less likely to catch Covid-19 than non-smokers of the same age and sex. 7.51pm BST There has been a surge of newly unemployed restaurant and pub workers forced to sleep on the streets of London because they can no longer afford to pay rent. Rough sleepers such as Martin, a recently-sacked chef from Poland, are finding life under lockdown increasingly difficult and dangerous. London has become so strange and sad. The only people who are out look like they are looking for drugs. There are a lot of crazy people with knives. Related: 'London is so strange and sad': the sacked hospitality workers sleeping rough Updated at 8.09pm BST 7.32pm BST South Korean officials emphasise they have detected no unusual movements in North Korea and caution against reports that Pyongyang’s leader, Kim Jong Un, may be ill or is being isolated because of coronavirus concerns, Reuters reports. At a closed-door forum on Sunday, South Korea’s unification minister, Kim Yeon-chul, who oversees North Korea engagement, said Seoul had the intelligence capabilities to say with confidence there were no indications of anything unusual. Rumours and speculation over the North Korean leader’s health began after he did not appear in public at a key state holiday on 15 April. He has since remained out of sight. Experts have cautioned that Kim has disappeared from state media coverage before, and that gathering accurate information in North Korea is difficult. Updated at 7.36pm BST 7.26pm BST Reacting to the news from the UK that families of NHS staff who die during their coronavirus work will get payments worth £60,000, the shadow health minister, Justin Madders, has said: It is welcome that the government has listened to workforce representatives and ensured that death-in-service benefits are available to everyone working in the NHS and social care sector. Now the government must finally get a grip over PPE supplies so that NHS and care staff aren’t putting their lives on the line to do their job and protect the rest of us. Updated at 7.33pm BST 7.16pm BST The US House of Representatives foreign affairs committee has launched an investigation into Donald Trump’s decision to block World Health Organization funding, giving the Department of State a week to provide relevant information. Writing to the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, the committee’s chairman said he would support reform of the “imperfect” UN health agency, but cutting its funding “while the world confronts the Covid-19 tragedy is not the answer”. In the letter, the Democratic representative, Eliot Engel, asked the State Department to provide 11 sets of documents or other information related to the decision to withhold funding no later than 4 May. If it did not do so, Engel said the committee would consider all measures at its disposal. A spokesman declined to provide specifics. Engel has the authority as a committee chairman to issue subpoenas to federal agencies. The requested materials included a list of interagency meetings between 1 December and 14 April at which funding for the WHO was discussed, a list of legal authorities under which the administration will execute the suspension of funds, and documents related to the administration’s investigation of the WHO. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump suspended US contributions to the WHO on 14 April, accusing it of being “China-centric” and promoting China’s “disinformation” about the coronavirus outbreak, and saying his administration would launch a review of the organisation. WHO officials have denied the claims and China insists it has been transparent and open. The United States is the WHO’s biggest donor. Trump’s decision prompted immediate criticism from US allies abroad, and within the United States from health experts and Democrats. Some Democrats accused the Republican president of using the WHO and China as scapegoats to distract from what they view as Trump’s mishandling of a pandemic that has killed nearly 55,000 Americans and cratered the economy. But Trump’s fellow Republicans have largely backed the president, praising his handling of the health crisis and calling on WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, to resign. Updated at 8.26pm BST 7.04pm BST Summary More than 3 million people around the world are now confirmed to have been infected with the coronavirus, according to a tally kept by researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The worst-affected country is by far the US, which – with 972,969 cases alone – counts for almost a third of the global total. Vaccines for more than 13 million people have been delayed because of the outbreak, the World Health Organization says. The WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, says vaccination drives against polio, measles, cholera, HPV, yellow fever and meningitis are affected. UK hospital deaths rose by 360, according to Matt Hancock, the UK’s health secretary, who said the total number of deaths in the country was now 21,902. The figure does not include deaths in other settings, which some estimates suggest will account for a significant proportion of the total. Italy reported 333 new deaths, a slightly accelerated increase compared to the previous 24 hours; up by 73. The number of people currently infected with the virus fell by 290 to 105,813. Italy has recorded 199,414 coronavirus cases to date. Mexico has managed “to tame” its coronavirus outbreak, the country’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, said, despite widespread suspicions that Covid-19 cases are being undercounted. Mexico reported its first Covid-19 case in late February and has now registered 1,351 deaths and 14,677 infections. WhatsApp claimed to have cut viral messages by 70% after introducing a limit on the number of people to whom users could forward messages. WhatsApp introduced the limit earlier this month amid claims that its service was contributing to the spread of misleading information about coronavirus. Many shops outside shopping malls are reopening in the Czech Republic as the government brings forward its five-stage lockdown exit plan. The UK government is understood to be closely studying the country’s approach as it seeks a route out of its own lockdown. Switzerland also began to ease its lockdown, with dentists, hairdressers and massage salons are among the services once again receiving customers. Most shops, schools and food markets will follow suit from 11 May, followed by vocational schools and universities from 8 June. Afghanistan recorded its biggest one-day rise in cases, triggered by a continued surge of transmission in Kandahar, as the health ministry warns two critical weeks lie ahead.

The worldwide death toll from the Covid-19 disease caused by the new virus recently passed 200,000. The worst-affected country is by far the US, which, with 972,969 cases alone, counts for almost a third of the global total, followed by Spain with 229,422, Italy with 199,414, and France with 162,220. However, with testing regimes differing widely around the world and questions raised about the efficacy of the tests themselves, the true number of cases is impossible to gauge.

Updated at 7.23pm BST 6.43pm BST Wearing face masks should not give people a false sense of security against the new coronavirus, one of Italy’s top public health officials has warned. Silvio Brusaferro, director of the ISS public health institute, said face masks should be worn on the street in cases when it is hard to maintain a safe distance from others. But masks “must not give a false sense of security”, Brusaferro told reporters. “It is an additional element, but personal hygiene and distancing are more important.” The Mediterranean country is making the use of face masks mandatory on transport and in stores as it gradually rolls back lockdown measures starting next Monday.

In Africa, we live in two worlds – the visible and the invisible. Only kings have the power through this libation to demand the protection of the invisible world. The king can order women who hold this secret to perform the ‘adjalou’ - a procession through the village to protect the people. During adjalou, these women are naked and we confine men and children in their homes. The women erect barricades at the entrance of villages to prevent bad spirits from entering and claiming lives. The procession is kept secret until the previous day when the royal announcer goes through the village to say it will take place. Updated at 6.48pm BST 6.26pm BST Children are falling ill with a new and potentially fatal combination of symptoms apparently linked to Covid-19, including a sore stomach and heart problems, reports Denis Campbell, the Guardian’s health policy correspondent. The children affected appear to have been struck by a form of toxic shock syndrome. Some have been left so seriously unwell that they have had to be treated in intensive care. At least one has undergone extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment, which is used when someone’s life is at risk because they can no longer breathe for themselves. It is not known how many such cases have appeared, though it is thought to be a small number. But NHS bosses are so concerned that they have written to doctors alerting them to the existence of the syndrome and asked them to urgently refer any children who appear to have it to hospital. In a letter to GPs in north London, reported by the Health Service Journal, NHS bosses said: It has been reported that over the last three weeks there has been an apparent rise in the number of children of all ages presenting with a multi-system inflammatory state requiring intensive care across London and also in other regions of the UK. The cases have in common overlapping feature of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters consistent with severe Covid-19 in children. There is a growing concern that a Sars-CoV-2-related inflammatory syndrome is emerging in children in the UK, or that there may be another, as yet unidentified, infectious pathogen associated with these cases.

While the country’s borders have been closed since March, the new decree goes further in preventing the sale and purchase of commercial flights to, from or within Argentina until 1 September. The spread of the coronavirus “does not allow certainties” for the end of social isolation measures, which would threaten commercial air transportation, the decree by the National Civil Aviation Administration said. It went on: It has been understood to be reasonable to set September 1, 2020 for the purpose of rescheduling regular operations or requesting authorisations for non-regular operations of passenger air transport subject to the effective lifting of restrictions imposed on commercial air transport and operating modalities. Part of the decree’s aim is to prevent airlines from ticketing flights not approved by the government. “The problem was that airlines were selling tickets without having authorisation to travel to Argentine soil,” a spokesman for President Alberto Fernández said. Aerolineas Argentinas passenger planes parked on the runway of the Jorge Newbery airport in Buenos Aires. Photograph: Miguel Lo Bianco/Reuters The decision prompted industry groups including ALTA, which lobbies on behalf of Latin American airlines, to warn that the decree represented an “imminent and substantial risk” to thousands of jobs in Argentina. It said in a statement: It is our responsibility to express the deep concern generated by the resolution in question, which was not shared or agreed with the industry and, furthermore, runs counter to the efforts of all the actors in the sector to propose and implement a plan for responsible and safe reactivation that re-establishes commercial activities and an essential service for the population. The presidential spokesman, however, said the decision resulted from a “consensus between the government and the airline sector”. Updated at 6.09pm BST 6.00pm BST Six more people have died from the coronavirus in Serbia, bringing the country’s total death toll to 162, Telegraf reports. The latest victims were three women and three men. Four of them were residents at the same care home, according to the Serbian news site. News of the latest deaths came as Serbia reported 233 more confirmed cases of Covid-19, bringing the total number of infections there so far to 8,275. Six weeks after Serbia declared a state of emergency in response to the pandemic, including special restrictions on the elderly, the UN Population Fund has helped launch a helpline for older people suffering from feelings of isolation. People aged over 65 in urban areas, and over 70 in smaller cities, are prohibited from engaging in habits like morning walks, coffee with neighbours or visits with relatives. Natasa Todorovic, of the Red Cross of Serbia, said: We know the psychological effects of isolation can have multiple negative effects, such as fear, nervousness, sadness and guilt. With so many stress factors that have arisen from the Covid-19 pandemic, such as fear of infection, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, stigma, financial challenges, having someone to talk to is very much needed. Updated at 6.05pm BST 5.45pm BST Here’s more from the World Health Organization’s coronavirus press briefing earlier, where Dr Mike Ryan, the WHO’s emergencies expert, said that the US seemed to have a “very clearly laid-out”, science-based federal plan for fighting its coronavirus epidemic – in spite of the bizarre outbursts of its president. “The federal government and the system of governors are working together to move America and its people through this very difficult situation,” Reuters reported Ryan as saying, adding that the federal system linking 50 states made the situation “complex”. Ryan repeated an earlier WHO warning against easing restrictions too soon. Speaking specifically about US plans to ease confinement measures, he said: We believe that the over-arching federal plan seems to be very much based on science ... We hope that the US government and its people can move through this plan, work through day-to-day how to do that and find a successful solution that reduces the impact on people’s lives and livelihoods. Updated at 5.55pm BST 5.37pm BST In parts of Germany, people caught in public without face masks face a €1,000 fine. In Madagascar they have another way of dealing with rule breakers: forcing them to sweep the streets. Face coverings have been made mandatory from today for everyone out in public in the Madagascan capital, Antananarivo, as well as in the cities of of Fianarantsoa and Toamasina, at the same time as other restrictions have begun to be loosened. Authorities warned that citizens leaving the house without face masks would face community service, AFP reports. The head of anti-coronavirus operations, Gen Elak Olivier Andriakaja, said on state television: Seventy percent of people on the street respected the rule … because they are scared of having to sweep pavements … Measures were taken before the sanctions fell into place to raise awareness and distribute mouth covers. I think that’s enough and that sanctions must now be applied. About 500 people in Antananarivo and Fianarantsoa were penalised on Monday, said the deputy head of police, Christian Rakotobe. Antananarivo’s commissioner, Hector Razafindrazaka, said 25 people were sentenced on the spot and forced to sweep the capital’s dusty streets. Images of the embarrassed-looking offenders were widely circulated on social media. To date, the Indian Ocean island-nation has recorded 128 cases of Covid-19. No fatalities have been recorded so far and 75 patients have recovered. A man stopped by the police for not wearing a mask in downtown Antananarivo.

Updated at 5.42pm BST 5.24pm BST New rules came into force on Monday legally requiring most people in Germany to wear face masks on public transport, long-distance trains and in shops, reports Kate Connolly, the Guardian’s Berlin correspondent. The so-called Maskenpflicht (mask duty) was introduced in 15 of the country’s 16 states on Monday morning. The northern state of Schleswig-Holstein will on Wednesday be the last state to implement the legislation. Fines of between €25 and €10,000 can be imposed on those who fail to wear a mask, with rates differing widely across the country, and some states, such as Berlin and Brandenburg, insisting they would not levy fines at all, but would rely instead on people showing each other mutual respect by wearing them. Other states said they would allow a few days of grace for people to get used to the new rule. A man looks at cotton face protection masks in a vending machine in Berlin Photograph: Clemens Bilan/EPA The heftiest fines will apply to shopkeepers whose staff are caught not wearing masks, and there are incremental fine systems in some states for repeat offenders. Authorities have been quick to insist the masks do not have to be medically approved. Scarfs or cloths over the nose or mouth are adequate. Tailors across the country, as well as bands of hobby sewers, have been busy making masks to meet high demand, while there are reports of elastic shortages.

Dentists, hairdressers, massage parlours and beauty salons were also among the services once again receiving customers, after closing down in March to slow the spread of the new disease. Most shops, schools and food markets will follow suit from 11 May. In a third stage, vocational schools and universities are set to reopen from 8 June, provided there is no significant increase in Covid-19 cases. Only grocery stores, chemists and other “essential” businesses have been allowed to remain open during the lockdown. “The number of new cases is continuing to decline, which is certainly good news on the first day we are starting to relax the measures,” Daniel Koch, the official leading Switzerland’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, told reporters in Bern. On Monday, Switzerland reported 30 new deaths from coronavirus, taking the total death toll in the country to 1,640. The total number of confirmed cases reached 29,164, after 103 new infections were detected – far fewer than in late March, when Swiss authorities were reporting close to a thousand or more cases each day.

Unlike its neighbours, Sweden has allowed schools for under-16s, cafes, bars, restaurants and businesses to stay open while urging people and businesses to respect social distancing guidelines. In an interview with Jon Henley, the Guardian’s European affairs correspondent, Sweden’s foreign minister, Ann Linde, said it was too early to judge her country’s light-touch approach to Covid-19. She said: There’s been a lot of misunderstanding. We have pretty much the same goals as every other government … And as we have always said, we are perfectly ready to go with more binding regulations if the population does not follow.

Tourism represents 10% of the EU’s economic output, but more in Italy, Spain, Croatia and Greece, which are facing a heavy blow from travel bans, grounded planes and closed borders. Gari Capelli, the minister of tourism in Croatia, who chaired the video conference, said the sector had “experienced an immense and unexpected decline in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic”. In a statement released after the meeting, he called for “the creation of joint solutions to the crisis of the tourism sector” as well as programmes and plans for combating similar threats in future. The minister did not spell out what he had in mind, while officials spoke of “common rules” and “protocols” expected to be defined in a forthcoming policy paper by the European commission. Capelli also said he was pleased that EU leaders had agreed last week to create a European Recovery Fund, which will give aid to the hardest-hit countries and sectors. “I believe that we are all aware that tourism definitely falls into the category of the most affected sectors in this crisis.” A woman swims at an empty beach in a southern Athens suburb on Saturday.

Unlike the vast majority of EU ministerial meetings, there was no press conference to allow journalists to question politicians on the substance of discussions. The UN World Tourism Organisation predicted a month ago that tourist arrivals could fall by 20-30% in 2020, leading to losses of up to $450bn (£362bn) for the industry. Updated at 3.42pm BST 3.33pm BST The downward trend in coronavirus deaths and new infections continues in the Netherlands, where 400 new confirmed cases and 43 new deaths were reported on Monday. That brings the total number of cases in the country to 38,245, with a death toll so far of 4,518, according to figures reported by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). Schools, businesses and some shops remain closed in the Netherlands, but some younger children are to be allowed back to school next month. Like Sweden, the Netherlands has made clear to the public that it is not seeking to try to eradicate Covid-19, but is pursuing an eventual goal of “herd immunity”. According to an in the coronavirus Q&A section of the RIVM website: Most people infected with the coronavirus recover. According to WHO, people show antibodies in their blood for at least a month after recovery. This means that in the Netherlands immunity against corona is being built up. This is not a goal in itself, but a result of the fact that the virus is present in the Netherlands. One of the effects is that gradually more people become immune to the virus, which will eventually lead to herd immunity, as is the case for other viral infections. As we are dealing with a newly emerged virus, WHO correctly states that there is no certainty about the development of immunity against COVID-19, or about how long this immunity will last. More information about this will become available soon. The Netherlands will keep on adapting its policy, based on the latest findings. Updated at 3.40pm BST 3.19pm BST Politicians in Germany are locked in a row over how and when to relax restrictions, amid grave concern, expressed by Angela Merkel and leading scientific figures, that the country is in danger of gambling away the advantages it has gained so far in dampening the spread of the virus, writes Kate Connolly, the Guardian’s Berlin correspondent. By Monday afternoon there were just over 158,000 confirmed infections and there have been 6047 deaths. As has been well publicised, Germany has done well on testing and tracing as well as on the number of its intensive care beds. Its death rate is much lower than other countries. But there are increasing references to the so-called ‘prevention paradox’ – by slowing down the virus’s spread the impression many have is that the dangers have been exaggerated and isn’t it therefore, about time the country got back to normal? The president of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble waded into the debate in a provocative way with his comments to Sunday newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, that Germany needed to better weigh up the social and economic costs with the desire to save lives and decisions should not be left just to virologists. “The massive economic, social, psychological and other effects need to be weighed up,” he said. “To just bring everything to a halt for two years can also have horrific consequences.” Schäuble said he did not believe that the first clause in the German constitution “human dignity is inviolable” meant preserving human lives at all costs. The clause anchored in the basic law “does not exclude that we must die,” he said. He stressed whilst the state should provide the best possible medical care for everyone, “people will continue to die of coronavirus”. He warned that the mood in the nation was in danger of tipping if the restrictions stayed in place for too long. “It will be harder, the longer it lasts,” he said. Medics test a driver for coronavirus at a testing station in Mitte, Berlin Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Meanwhile experts are calling on the government to more than double the level of Germany’s current testing levels before it considers loosening restrictions. Currently Germany has the capacity to carry out up to 818,000 tests every week, according to Helge Braun, head of Merkel’s chancellery, but advisers have said that figure should rise to 2 million. “Increasing the test capacity enables a detailed picture of the pandemic’s progress and helps form a basis for the evaluation of possible relaxation measures by the government,” he said. While many countries have looked in admiration at Germany’s ability to carry out large-scale tests, the constant question being asked in the country is: why is there not more testing?

Photograph: Sáshenka Gutiérrez/EPA Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has claimed his country has managed “to tame” the coronavirus pandemic despite widespread suspicions that Covid cases are being undercounted in Latin America’s second biggest economy. Mexico reported its first Covid case in late February and has now registered 1,351 deaths and 14,677 infections. Experts say they believe the country is still several weeks away from the peak of infections. But in a video message on Sunday López Obrador, or Amlo as he is widely known, claimed: “We’re doing well because we have managed to tame the epidemic”. Amlo praised Mexico’s 126 million citizens for helping slow the disease’s advance by following social distancing guidelines “to the letter”. Health specialists questioned Amlo’s claim Covid had been completely controlled. “I don’t believe we should be claiming victory,” said Alejandro Macías, a leading infectious diseases specialist. “We’re still in the upward phase [of infections].” Amlo has said he hopes Mexico can begin returning to normal from mid-May onwards, with schools possibly reopening at the start of June. But Macías said he believed low testing meant only a “small fraction” of cases had been identified and that it was not yet time to reopen. “To me these dates seem a little premature because we don’t yet know what the intensity of this will be,” he said. “Italy, France and Spain started this problem well before Mexico.” In a clear indication of concern over Covid’s spread, there were reports over the weekend that authorities in Jalisco state were racing to complete a special 700-grave cemetery for coronavirus victims.

Despite delays and the ongoing coronavirus crisis, the rector of the cathedral, Monsignor Patrick Chauvet, said work was still on target to hit the five-year deadline set by President Emmanuel Macron.

Under increasing pressure to lift parts of the UK’s lockdown and limit the damage to the economy, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is understood to be studying the Czech Republic’s approach to lifting the tight restrictions it imposed earlier than most countries further west, which have helped it limit cases to 7,400, with just 221 deaths [with the latest four cases and one death reported today - DG].

By 11 March it had closed all schools, limited public gatherings, banned all public events, sealed its borders and shuttered all non-essential stores. It also made face masks obligatory in public. Early this month it became the first European country to relax its restrictions, initially by allowing citizens to cycle, jog and walk in the countryside without wearing their masks, as long as they stayed 2 metres apart.

WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, introduced the limit earlier this month amid claims that its service was contributing to the spread of misleading information about the coronavirus pandemic. It cut the number of chats to which a user could pass on a so-called “highly forwarded message” from five to one. On Monday, a WhatsApp spokesperson said: WhatsApp is committed to doing our part to tackle viral messages. We recently introduced a limit to sharing ‘highly forwarded messages’ to just one chat. Since putting into place this new limit, globally there has been a 70% reduction in the number of highly forwarded messages sent on WhatsApp. This change is helping keep WhatsApp a place for personal and private conversations. Updated at 1.32pm BST 1.19pm BST Three hundred thousand people could starve to death every day for three months if the crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic stops the World Food Programme from reaching them with critical supplies, its director has said. David Beasley said in an interview with the Associated Press he has also been telling leaders that maintaining supply chains is critical and there are many potential obstacles, including export restrictions, closed borders and ports, farms not producing and roads closed. He said he had been spending hours every day speaking with officials in donor countries to try to keep donations coming, but that he was afraid that severe economic problems cut lead to cuts in funding at the same time as a catastrophic global recession. Support for WFP comes from the US, the UK, Germany, the European Union, Japan and other prosperous nations, he said. If their economies deteriorate substantially, that impacts our money, it impacts the local economies in the developing nations in a variety of different ways. According to Beasley, a former governor of South Carolina, 821 million people go to bed hungry every night all over the world now, a further 135 million people are facing crisis levels of hunger or worse. He said: WFP is providing food to nearly 100 million people on any given day, including about 30 million people who literally depend on us to stay alive. And if those 30 million people cant be reached, our analysis shows that 300,000 people could starve to death every single day over a three-month period and that doesn’t include increased starvation due to the new coronavirus.” In a worst-case scenario, we could be looking at famine in about three dozen countries, and in 10 of them there are already more than 1 million people per country on the verge of starvation.” Updated at 1.24pm BST 1.02pm BST Kenya has hailed its “tremendous progress” in recoveries from Covid-19, after eight patients with the disease were discharged from hospital - the same number of new carriers identified in the past 24 hours.

In an article, they write: There is a single species responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic – us. Recent pandemics are a direct consequence of human activity, particularly our global financial and economic systems that prize economic growth at any cost.

Primary schools and daycare centres are due to reopen in the country in early May, prime minister Mark Rutte announced last week, although class sizes may be cut to accommodate health guidelines, NLTimes reported. Controversy soon erupted, however, when a member of the Dutch outbreak management team suggested in a television appearance that the reopening of schools was part of a strategy to allow the virus to gradually spread through the population. Speaking on school reopening plans, Ann Vossen said last Tuesday that the Dutch government’s aim was not to eradicate the epidemic, but to slow it down. She said: It’s a common sentiment among the general public that we should ‘put a stop to it now!’ But that is not really the goal here. We just want to make sure it spreads in a gradual way, so to speak, while keeping the risk to public health the healthcare system as low as possible. But we do not want to halt it completely, because in that case we would have had to opt for a complete lockdown. Hello, world. Here is the Dutch #COVID19 approach.

They are counter to the advice from the World Health Organization, which has called for a “test, trace and quarantine” strategy to keep outbreaks as controlled as possible until a vaccine is available. However, in Sweden, the government has had more support for a similar approach.

Updated at 12.47pm BST 12.27pm BST Hospitals in Belgium admitted the lowest number of Covid-19 patients since the start of the lockdown almost seven weeks ago, figures showed on Monday, a week before the country starts to ease restrictions, Reuters reports. The number of hospital admissions, a key number to monitor the disease’s evolution, fell to 127 on Sunday, the lowest level since 18 March. Daily admissions peaked at over 600 at the end of March and have hovered at around 200 for the past week. The number of new confirmed Covid-19 cases also declined to a month low of 553, although health officials said the decline might be in part due to a weekend effect. The nation of 11.5 million people closed restaurants, cafes, gyms and schools from 14 March and then ordered that all non-food shops close from 18 March. The government outlined plans on Friday to allow a gradual easing of restrictions from 4 May, with a series of phases of further reopening during the course of the month.

The UN said the figures highlighted “the urgent need for all parties to the conflict to do more to protect civilians from harm, especially in view of the looming threat posed to all Afghans by Covid-19”. Deborah Lyons, the secretary general’s special representative for Afghanistan and head of UNAMA, said: I call on all parties to seize the opportunity offered by the secretary-general’s call for a global ceasefire to focus collective efforts on fighting a common enemy, the Covid-19 pandemic. To safeguard the lives of countless civilians in Afghanistan and to give the nation hope of a better future, it is imperative that violence is stopped with the establishment of a ceasefire and for peace negotiations to commence. Mayar, the health ministry spokesman, asked the Taliban to stop “killing brothers and instead fight against one enemy, which is coronavirus”. But in a tweet on Thursday, the Taliban’s spokesman, Suhail Shaheen, rejected ceasefire offers, citing ongoing disagreements over a potential peace process and a delayed prisoner exchange as reasons to keep fighting. Updated at 12.20pm BST 11.53am BST A loophole in Ireland’s lockdown laws means police cannot detain visitors from Northern Ireland, raising concern that some people may cross the border and defy physical distancing regulations, Rory Carroll reports from Dublin. Gardaí have been ordered not to arrest anyone from Northern Ireland because they have no powers of enforcement over people who do not live in the republic, RTE reported. The disclosure prompted concern from politicians and residents in Donegal and other border counties that Northern Ireland residents chafing at the UK’s continued lockdown may visit holiday homes and tour beauty spots in the republic. Residents in the republic are chafing at a ban on travelling more than 2km from home and would bristle at any sign of cross-border visitors taking advantage of the loophole. Sinn Féin said the loophole reinforced the need for an all-island response to the coronavirus pandemic. The party has also cited the UK’s higher death rate as further reason for an all-Ireland approach. The Ulster Unionist party accused Sinn Féin of “perverse” political point-scoring.

The country remains one of the world’s hardest-hit, with 23,521 lives claimed by the virus. The total number of cases, as confirmed by PCR tests, rose to 209,465 from 207,634 the day before. In recent days, the data has offered a glimmer of hope; Monday marked the fourth day in which the number of overnight deaths has hovered below 400 after reaching a high of 950 deaths on 2 April. The number of deaths and new infections is clearly on the decline, said Fernando Simón, the head of Spain’s centre for health emergencies. “And obviously this gives us hope.” As Spain’s outbreak appears to ease, residents have begun to get a glimpse of what health officials have described as the country’s “new normality”. On Sunday, more than 6 million children were allowed outside for the first time in six weeks. The daily outings come with stringent rules: Children must be 13 years of age or younger, stay within one kilometre of their homes and be supervised by one adult. The outings are limited to one hour once a day. While accusations of parents and children flouting physical distancing rules circulated on social media, the country’s health minister, Salvador Illa, said Sunday most families appeared to be following the restrictions. The government would continue to monitor the situation closely, he added, “and take steps if necessary”. The military – deployed at the height of the crisis to help with tasks such as disinfecting care homes and setting up field hospitals – has also started to retreat from Spanish streets, with the number of officers dropping from around 3,500 last week to just over 2,000, according to the defence ministry. The Spanish government has said it is eyeing allowing adults to exercise outdoors as of 2 May if infections continue to fall. The country’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, is expected to present more detailed plans on how it will cautiously ease out of the lockdown on Tuesday. The relaxing of the emergency measures comes as officials scramble to get a better picture of how far-reaching the virus has been in Spain. On Monday, scientists began carrying out antibody tests on more than 36,000 randomly selected households across the country in a study that is expected to continue for weeks. Updated at 12.03pm BST 11.33am BST Summary Confirmed cases worldwide approach 3 million Cases are nearing the 3 million mark, according to Johns Hopkins University, with 2,981,592 confirmed. At least 206,803 people have lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic, though the true toll is likely to be much higher due to under-reporting and some countries not including deaths among those with underlying conditions in their tolls. European countries cautiously ease lockdowns France is due to announce plans to ease its strict lockdown measures in promised “deconfinement plan”. Germany has urged states to “go carefully” with the lifting of restrictions. Primary school children in Norway have gone back to school after the government declared it had controlled the outbreak.

Updated at 12.05pm BST 10.43am BST China’s foreign ministry has denied claims that Beijing is spreading disinformation about the coronavirus following a European Union report that said there was “significant evidence” of covert Chinese operations on social media, Reuters reports. “China is opposed to the creation and spreading of disinformation by anyone or any organisation. China is a victim of disinformation, not an initiator,” said foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang at a regular press briefing on Monday. The report by the EU’s foreign policy arm said state-backed governments including China and Russia were responsible for spreading disinfomration on the virus. Reuters earlier reported that senior Chinese officials pressured the EU to drop the criticisms from the report last week, stating that it would make Beijing “very angry”. The report was published late last week after a delay and some information regarding China was changed. An EU spokeswoman declined to comment. China has fiercely defended its handling of the novel coronavirus amid calls from some countries to initiate an independent investigation into the virus and its source. The foreign ministry’s Geng said there was no conclusive evidence that the virus originated in China, and warned that “political manoeuvring” behind calls for an independent investigation would not be successful. He also hit back at Donald Trump’s claims that China has been hiding the true extent of the virus. He suggested Trump was trying to shift blame for his own failings. #FMsays Amid domestic questions about whether the US government is coping with #COVID_19 effectively, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang asked \"are the US government hiding something?

The Belgian government outlined a plan to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown last week, but with holidays abroad likely to remain impossible, burgemeester Bart Tommelein has received tentative backing from the government’s top virologist for his plan of a system of passes to keep people on beaches safe this summer. “It’s going to be an ants’ nest here,” Tommelein said when he proposed the beach passes plan, or strandpas in the local Flemish dialect used in the north of Belgium. The mayor’s sliding scale of priority, with tax-paying locals, second home owners and hotel guests given preference, has provoked criticism among the other nine coastal municipalities, and sparked a discussion about the right of all Belgians to access the country’s sandy beaches.

President Emmanuel Macron and the prime minister, Édouard Philippe, have been finalising details of the “deconfinement plan” that will be announced in the Assemblée Nationale, the lower house of parliament, at 3pm local time followed by a debate and a vote. Opposition MPs are angry they will be give only hours to discuss the plan and insist they need at least 24 hours to consider it and respond. Ministers from each sector were asked to present concrete proposals of how to end the coronavirus lockdown in six areas: health policy, school reopenings, the return to work for adults, businesses, transport and cultural or religious gatherings. The government is also hoping to have a Covid-19 tracking application available by 11 May, which has also raised concerns among the opposition benches. The scientific committee that is advising the government is reported to have serious reservations about the president’s announcement that schools will reopen progressively from 11 May, describing it in a statement as a “political decision”. The committee has advised schools remain closed until September. It has advised that the wearing of face masks be mandatory in public places and sanitising hand gel available to everyone. The health minister, Olivier Véran, has said the authorities will aim to carry out between 500,000 and 700,000 tests for Covid-19 among those showing symptoms of the virus, but insisted it was “impossible to test everyone”. Suggestions that the lockdown will be ended by region and by age, with older people being required to remain at home, have been reportedly ruled out. The measures in the plan will remain in place until mid-July and will be re-examined if there is a second coronavirus wave. Here are the latest Covid-19 figures from France, that has been under one of the more draconian lockdown regimes since 17 March. Restaurants, cafes, hotels and all non-essential shops have been closed since midnight on 14 March. Note that unlike the UK, the total number of deaths includes those in care homes.

Germany has had around 150,000 diagnosed cases of coronavirus, according to official figures published on Monday, but has only had 5,750 deaths, a far lower proportion of fatalities than neighbouring Italy, Spain, France and Britain. “As a person who believes in fact-based decisions, I recommend to all of us to proceed very carefully in order not to be forced into eventually rescinding easing measures,” Peter Altmaier told Deutschlandfunk radio on Monday. Markus Soeder, the premier of Bavaria, which has imposed some of the strictest social distancing measures, said his state was only taking small steps towards easing lockdown in order not to jeopardise early successes in fighting the disease. Soeder told BR radio that 80% of the retail sector are open again. “If it works out this week, we can think about a further easing.” The state minister of Lower Saxony Stephan Weil speaks to journalists on the first day of the resumption of car production at the Volkswagen factory in Wolfsburg.

Around 55% of the world’s population live in urban areas and that number is projected to rise to 68% by 2050. Nature’s role in the wellbeing and happiness of billions of people will be more important than ever. While urbanisation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, many conservationists and town planners are trying to make built-up areas more nature-friendly. The role of green spaces in urban areas has even been formalised in a draft UN agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, often referred to as the Paris agreement for nature. The Covid-19 outbreak has seen cities and towns across the world go into lockdown which has enabled wildlife such as wild boar, deer, monkeys, foxes and even lions to venture into territory previously dominated by humans. It has also offered us the chance to notice and appreciate the natural world in cities in an unprecedented way. In this special series of reports we’ll be looking at how animals and plants adapt to city life, what to look out for right now and how we can encourage more wild cities in the future. Here’s the first piece in the series: Related: 'The bliss of a quiet period': lockdown is a unique chance to study the nature of cities 8.24am BST Primary schools reopen in Norway Olav Kneppen takes his four-year-old son Oliver to nursery school in Oslo Photograph: Pierre-Henry Deshayes/AFP via Getty Images Children have begun returning to school in Norway, as primary schools reopen after the government claimed the coronavirus epidemic is under control, AFP reports. One week after nursery schools, pupils aged six to 10 started returning to their school desks after six weeks of remote learning from home. Classes were however reduced to a maximum of 15 students. Norway has progressively begun lifting restrictions imposed on 12 March to combat the spread of coronavirus. Hair salons and dermatologists were also authorised to resume business. Many measures remain in place, such as bans on sporting and cultural events, as well as physical distancing and hygiene recommendations. “We should not let down our guard, we have to work hard to keep the spread under control,” prime minister Erna Solberg said on Friday. “If we’re not careful, this could have serious consequences for others. In the worst of cases, we’ll have to tighten restrictions again. We’ll have to make sure to avoid that.” Some parents however find the return to school premature, noting that several staff at nursery schools have tested positive for the virus since they went back last week. “It wouldn’t surprise me that it gets worse when the schools reopen,” one user wrote on the Facebook page “My child should not be a guinea pig for Covid-19” that has almost 30,000 members. By Sunday, Norway had reported 7,505 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus and 193 deaths, while the curve of hospitalised cases has dropped significantly in recent weeks.

Photograph: Petros Giannakouris/AP Greece is preparing to lift restrictions on movement to islands and other parts of the country in June, media reports suggested on Monday. In an address to the nation on Tuesday, the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, is expected to outline how measures enforced to curb coronavirus almost two months ago will be gradually eased. The lockdown will be reversed in stages and is likely to require at least two months to unfold with small shops, hairdressers, beauticians and barbers opening on 4 May and secondary school students returning to class on 11 May. Restaurants, tavernas and other eateries will follow but will only be permitted to function with outside tables. “The return to normality will likely happen in three stages, at the beginning of May, the end of May and mid June,” said one insider. Government officials say it is essential that the economy is unlocked in a country that was only beginning to recover from a long and punishing debt crisis when the pandemic struck. The country’s tourist-reliant economy is on course to contract by as much as 10% this year, the finance minister announced at the weekend. Greece enforced measures to combat the deadly disease “hard and early” and has, as a result, fared better than most other EU member states with a death toll of 134 and 2,517 confirmed cases of the novel virus to date. The time gained has allowed the government to beef up the public health system – hit by successive budget cuts during the financial crisis - increasing the number of intensive care beds by 80% and employing an extra 3,200 medical staff. But Mitsotakis has already spoken of a possible second wave in the winter. With the war against the virus not yet over, aides say he will insist on the need for vigilance in the months ahead.

The companies are concerned that environmental issues will be put on the backburner during the Covid-19 pandemic. Car makers are already lobbying to prevent the announced tightening of emissions limits on cars, airlines for a waiver on jet fuel taxes, and the plastics industry for an appeal of the ban on some plastics products. “The pandemic highlights the vulnerability of our globalized economic system to threats that are not limited to regions or industries,” the appeal says. “Climate change is a comparable challenge.” The German BDI industry association said it was sticking to the European goal of climate neutrality, or net zero greenhouse gas emissions, in 2050, but warned that governments, companies and households will in future have reduced scope for investments. “The EU’s Green Deal must therefore become a Smart Deal, in which growth, employment and ambitious climate protection targets are linked as efficiently as possible via an intelligent investment and relief package,” said BDI deputy managing director Holger Loesch. 7.33am BST A team of more than 200 doctors from Cuba have arrived in South Africa to help it tackle coronavirus.

The Royal College of Physicians has condemned the apparently worsening availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) as “truly terrible” and warned that frontline staff’s lives are at risk as a result. Among doctors performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGP), in which patients with the disease release droplets from their mouth, 37% cannot always access a visor to wear while 31% have not been able to obtain a full-length surgical gown. Both are key elements of the full PPE NHS staff are advised to wear when participating in an AGP, such as a patient being intubated before being ventilated. A survey undertaken by the college, to which 2,129 hospital doctors responded last week, found medics are finding it harder generally access to any sort of PPE. Just over a quarter (27%) said they could not get the kit they needed to keep them safe while treating people with Covid-19, up from 22% who said the same when the RCP conducted the same survey at the start of April.

One of them said he was a business owner and had bought the masks, including 5,000 high protection FFP2 masks, in the Netherlands for a total of €80,000 (US$87,000). The masks were to be sold to construction workers for a large profit, according to police. In March, 32,500 masks from China were seized from a warehouse near Paris and 28,800 masks were discovered in a shop in a district of Chinese wholesalers, also in the Paris region. 3.35am BST New Zealanders will be allowed to go fishing, surfing, hunting and hiking this week for the first time in more than a month as the country begins to ease its way out of a strict lockdown that successfully slowed the spread of the coronavirus, Reuters reports. Around 400,000 people will return to work after the country shifts its alert level down a notch at midnight on Monday, but shops and restaurants will remain closed as several social restrictions remain in place.

While Ardern has generally received public support, there has been growing criticism that similar results may have been achieved with less stringent lockdown measures, as in Australia. Getting the $200 billion trade and tourism dependent economy running again from a standing start will be a major challenge for Ardern as she faces national elections in September. 3.26am BST Mexico has almost entirely cleared out government migrant centres over the past five weeks to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, returning most of the occupants to their countries of origin, official data showed on Sunday. In a statement, the National Migration Institute (INM) said that since 21 March, in order to comply with health and safety guidelines, it had been removing migrants from its 65 migrant facilities, which held 3,759 people last month. In the intervening weeks, Mexico has returned 3,653 migrants to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador by road and air, with the result that only 106 people remain in the centres, it said.

Commonly used as replacement substances for opioid addiction, most users are required to travel daily to pharmacies to access their prescriptions. But the new guidelines mean that, with some restrictions, pharmacies are able to offer takeaway doses earlier in a patient’s therapy. Other states are trying similar things. In New South Wales, addiction specialists are pushing for earlier access to longer-acting replacement therapies to reduce the need for patients to visit clinics. Across Australia, the Covid-19 crisis has prompted a seismic reckoning in addiction medicine. While people like George are managing to find a way through the crisis, experts are concerned that rising substance abuse fuelled by the virus, coupled with new restrictions on an already over-burdened drug and alcohol rehabilitation system, could see Australia staring down a crisis in addiction.

Australia has been one of the most successful countries in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, recording just 83 deaths and 6,700 cases, due to border closures, movement restrictions and a stay-at-home policy. It has lowered its infection rate to currently around 1% from 25% in March. The Australian government launched a new Covid-19 app, CovidSafe, on Sunday. The app is aimed to speed up the process of identifying people who have been in close contact with someone diagnosed with the Covid-19, and quickly stop further spread of the virus in the community. Photograph: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock Health Minister Greg Hunt said 1.13 million Australians downloaded the tracing app CovidSafe as of 6am (20.00 GMT) on Monday, nearly 4.5% of the country’s population. The first one million came within five hours of launching the app, he added. When asked how many people need to download the app for it to be successful, Hunt said “there is no magic number.” “As many as possible is our real goal,” he added. “It is about assisting our disease experts find people who might have been exposed and we are well ahead of our best hopes and expectations already.” Here’s an explainer about how the app works – and the privacy concerns involved: Related: Covid safe: Australian government launches coronavirus tracing app amid lingering privacy concerns The surge in downloads come as a Newspoll conducted for The Australian newspaper (paywalled) showed Morrison enjoyed the best approval rating for a leader since end-2008.

Japanese bank tellers wearing protective face masks work at counters behind plastic curtains in Tokyo, Japan, 24 April 2020. Photograph: Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters Such a move would put the BOJ in line with other major central banks that have unleashed unprecedented amounts of monetary support amid the health crisis. Sources have told Reuters the BOJ is likely to take further steps to ease funding strains for companies whose sales have collapsed, such as boosting purchases of corporate bonds and commercial debt. The central bank may also clarify its commitment to buy unlimited amounts of government bonds by scrapping loose guidance to buy them at an annual pace of ¥80tn (US$744bn) per year, say sources familiar with its thinking. Removing the guidance will be largely symbolic, they say. The BOJ has only purchased less than ¥20tn per year, as the bank’s huge presence in the market allows it to control yields with fewer purchases. 1.46am BST China has reported no new coronavirus deaths on 26 April – the same as the day before. It reported three new mainland cases, compared to 11 the previous day and 25 asymptomatic cases, compared to 30 the day before, and two new imported cases, compared to five the day before. Mainland China now has an accumulated total of 82,830 cases. It also recorded a total of 4,633 deaths as of the end of April 26, including one more death in Beijing in the tally that was previously unaccounted for.

It will be divided up into white, yellow and red regions based on the number of infections and deaths, Rouhani said, according to the presidency’s website. Activities in each region will be restricted accordingly, so an area that has been consistently free of infections or deaths will be labelled white and mosques could be reopened and Friday prayers resumed, Rouhani said. He said the label given to any region in the Islamic Republic could change and he did not specify when the colour-coding programme would come into force. Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi said in an interview with state TV on Sunday that 116 counties in the country could be considered white at the moment and 134 yellow. Iranians have returned to shops, bazaars and parks over the past week as the country eases coronavirus restrictions, with the daily increase in the death toll below 100 since April 14. The toll rose by 60 over the past 24 hours to 5,710, with 90,481 confirmed cases, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur told state TV on Sunday. 1.01am BST UK economy will take three years to recover from coronavirus – EY It will take the UK economy three years to fully recover from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a leading forecasting group. As the damage for jobs and growth unfolds, the EY Item Club said it would take until 2023 for the the economy to return to the level reached at the end of last year due to the depth of the crisis. One month on from the imposition of lockdown measures across Britain, effectively bringing large swathes of the economy to a halt, the group warned that almost half of all consumer spending in 2020 – the major engine of UK growth over recent decades – is at risk of either being delayed or lost completely. The group of economists said GDP was set to collapse by 6.8% in 2020, before returning to positive growth of 4.5% in 2021 as businesses try to make up for lost time and consumers ramp up their spending again.

The Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management took the decision since no new Covid-19 cases were recorded in the two areas in the last two days, the government media office said in a statement. It said more than 6,000 tests were conducted among Al Ras and Naif residents in less than a month. The UAE has reported more than 10,300 cases and 76 deaths resulting from the virus, the second-highest count among the six Gulf Arab countries after Saudi Arabia. It does not give breakdowns for each of the seven emirates that make up the country. Updated at 12.54am BST 12.36am BST Donald Trump’s coronavirus response coordinator, Dr Deborah Birx, has cautioned that social distancing measures are likely to stay in place throughout the summer, as she sought to downplay the president’s dangerous suggestion that injected disinfectant and ultraviolet light could play a role in the medical treatment of Covid-19. Birx made a number of appearances on the Sunday morning TV news shows, where she was asked about Trump’s outlandish comments made at a White House briefing on Thursday, which prompted immediate backlash from medical experts and industrial manufacturers who cited the potentially fatal outcome of such a process. Trump has falsely claimed the comments were sarcastic. Appearing on CNN’s State of the Union, Birx was asked if she was bothered by the fallout from the president’s remarks. “It bothers me that this is still in the news cycle, because I think we’re missing the bigger pieces of what we need to be doing as an American people to continue to protect one another,” Birx said. “As a scientist and a public health official and a researcher, sometimes I worry that we don’t get the information to the American people that they need when we continue to bring up something that was from Thursday night.” Related: Birx declines to criticise Trump and warns distancing will last months 12.31am BST Trump denies that he plans to fire Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar US President Donald Trump, who for a second day skipped the White House press briefing, took to Twitter to deny reports that he planned to fire Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar: Reports that H.H.S. Secretary @AlexAzar is going to be “fired” by me are Fake News. The Lamestream Media knows this, but they are desperate to create the perception of chaos & havoc in the minds of the public. They never even called to ask. Alex is doing an excellent job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 26, 2020 Trump also attacked the press, and was roundly mocked after tweeting about “Noble” prize for journalists, seeming to mean the Nobel prizes – which aren’t awarded in the field of journalism – or Pulitzers. Several 2019 Pulitzer winners interrogated his administration. “When will all of the “reporters” who have received Noble [sic] Prizes for their work on Russia, Russia, Russia, only to have been proven totally wrong (and, in fact, it was the other side who committed the crimes), be turning back their cherished “Nobles” so that they can be given ....to the REAL REPORTERS & JOURNALISTS who got it right.” Trump later tweeted that he had meant “Noble” as in “having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals,” and that he was being sarcastic in the earlier tweet. He has also claimed sarcasm as the intention behind is comments about injecting disinfectant. Does anybody get the meaning of what a so-called Noble (not Nobel) Prize is, especially as it pertains to Reporters and Journalists? Noble is defined as, “having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals.” Does sarcasm ever work? — Donald J.

World Health Organisation clarifies statement about immunity following concern among scientists. The global health body was criticised for saying there was “currently no evidence” that people who recover from Covid-19 will have some immunity from reinfection. Russia could experience a new spike in cases if people flout lockdown measures during public holidays scheduled for early May, a top health official said on Sunday, after total reported infections in Russia topped 80,000. Chile is to push ahead with immunity passports and is planning to issue previously announced “release certificates” for recovered Covid-19 patients ‘“soon”, despite a World Health Organization warning that it is not clear whether people have immunity after becoming infected. New York governor outlines lifting of restrictions for parts of the state. Andrew Cuomo said some regions of the state might qualify to open sooner, “with certain precautions”, such as upstate New York, as the daily death toll was markedly lower on Sunday than it was on Saturday. India’s PM urges citizens to abide by the lockdown amid “war” on the coronavirus, as new cases continue to rise. Narendra Modi gave a radio address to urge its 1.3 billion citizens to strictly comply with the nationwide lockdown as the number of confirmed cases increased steadily despite the month-long curfew.

The hearty innovation is the perfect embodiment of Rome’s modern food traditions: economical, thoughtfully prepared, and rooted in the flavours of the past. • Via Vespasiano 2, on Facebook CAPITOLINE MUSEUMS Terre e Domus wine bar At the base of the Capitoline Hill, Terre e Domus is a joint venture between the government and chef Marco Pasquali, aimed at promoting food produced in Rome and its environs. The strictly seasonal menu highlights the region’s bounty, with dishes such as vignarola (a spring stew of broad beans, peas, artichokes and lettuce, €10), while year-round items such as amatriciana (pasta with pancetta and tomato, €10) is a bright and balanced dish. Go at lunchtime and grab a table near the floor-to-ceiling windows for views over second-century Trajan’s column and the Forum. • Foro Traiano 82; on Facebook TRASTEVERE La Tavernaccia In spite of the name, which means “grotty tavern”, this is a pleasant family-run trattoria serving excellent food in bright rooms near Trastevere Station. Umbrian-born founder Bruno Persiani has passed the reins to his Roman-raised daughters and the result is a menu merging central Italian mountain traditions like pappardelle with boar ragù (around €13) and Roman classics. The spaghetti alla gricia (with pancetta, pecorino cheese and black pepper, €11) is one of Rome’s most satisfying versions. The wood-fired pizzas are crisp and delicious and the chef also uses the wood-burning oven to slow-roast punta di petto (beef brisket, €13) and maialino (suckling pig, €13) to tender, succulent perfection. • Via G da Castelbolognese 63, latavernacciaroma.com COLOSSEUM/FORUM/PALATINE Tempio di Iside Francesco Tripodi, a Calabrian transplant to Rome, serves supremely fresh fish at this cavernous restaurant near the Colosseum. The menu is divided into raw and cooked starters, such as fish carpaccio (€20) and roasted scallops (€16), pasta dishes – alle vongole (with clams) and ai ricci (sea urchins, both €16) are outstanding – and whole fish baked in salt or roasted with potatoes. The menu changes slightly to reflect seasonal catch, but Tempio di Iside’s kitchen always balances exceptional quality and freshness with minimalist techniques. • Via Pietro Verri, 11, isideristorante.it VILLA PAMPHILJ Cesare al Casaletto On the ground floor of a residential block near Villa Pamphilj, Rome’s largest public park, Cesare al Casaletto is the quintessential Roman trattoria. The menu features the Roman cuisine’s greatest hits: carbonara, gricia, amatriciana (all around €11) and a healthy sampling of quinto quarto (offal). There’s also plenty for vegetarians: tonnarelli cacio e pepe offers a perfect balance of savory pecorino and piquant black pepper. But be sure to kick it all off with fried appetisers – croquettes of shredded beef or aubergine, or baby squid. Pair it all with shockingly affordable sparkling and still wines from Italy, Slovenia and France. • Via del Casaletto 45, trattoriadacesare.it PANTHEON Armando al Pantheon As the name suggests, Armando is next to the city’s most intact ancient structure, but in spite of its location, it remains dedicated to serving Rome’s soulful classics, such as spaghetti alla gricia (around €10.50) and coda alla vaccinara (stewed oxtail, €18). Armando Gargioli opened this Roman institution in 1961 and now his children and grandchildren run the place, weaving a few original creations onto the menu, like calamari with tomatoes and saba (grape molasses, €14). It’s small and very popular, so use the online booking system to bag a place in the homely dining room, embellished with artwork donated by decades of regulars. • Salita dei Crescenzi 31, armandoalpantheon.it CASTEL SANT’ANGELO Sorpasso Sorpasso is in three distinct zones: a handful of outdoor seats, crowded with standing and seated customers sipping wine; a bar area flanked by hanging cured meats and shelves of wine; and a dining room serving a full menu of pasta, meat, and fish dishes. The first two zones are ideal for snacks such as a cheese plate (€10), a selection of salamis (€9), or a salad (from €6.50) with wine or a cocktail. The back room specialises in simple pastas (around €12) and trapizzini (from €3.50). • Via Properzio 31, sorpasso.info TREVI FOUNTAIN Al Moro Down a nondescript alley and packed with sketches and paintings by artistic regulars, Al Moro is among Rome’s most historic trattorias.

There are plenty of mainstream dishes, too, like spaghetti alla Moro, the house version of carbonara, with pancetta-enriched egg sauce seasoned with red pepper flakes (€22). • Vicolo delle Bollette 13, ristorantealmororoma.com MAXXI Enoteca Mostò The residential Flaminio district around the MAXXI art gallery and Parco della Musica auditorium attracts culture vultures who stick around for a glass and a snack at the zone’s growing number of casual bistros and wine bars. Among them is Mostò, a spartan wine bar where the main decor is the shelving filled with bottles of Italian vino and sparkling French wine. The menu features light fare such as steak tartare and beef carpaccio (both around €15) and buffalo mozzarella (around €13).

Contagion at sea inspired a special horror, as pleasure palaces turned into prison hulks, and rumours of infection on board spread between fetid cabins via WhatsApp. Trapped in close proximity to their fellow passengers, holidaymakers experienced the distress of being both victims and agents of infection, as a succession of ports refused them entry. When it began, the deadly situation at sea was seen as a freakish outgrowth of what many still thought of as a Chinese problem. The first ship to suffer a major outbreak was the Diamond Princess. By mid-February, 355 cases had been confirmed aboard, and the ship was held being in quarantine in the port of Yokohama. At the time, the ship accounted for more than half of reported cases outside China. Fourteen passengers on the Diamond Princess would die of the virus. Related: The end of tourism? – podcast The nightmare at sea has not concluded. Even after passengers from more than 30 afflicted cruise ships were allowed to disembark, and flooded into hospitals, quarantine hotels or on to charter flights home, an estimated 100,000 crew and staff remained trapped at sea, some in quarantine, others blocked from disembarking until their employers could make onward travel arrangements. This second drama led to a mass hunger strike – by 15 Romanian crew in limbo off the coast of Florida – and a police intervention to quell disturbances on a ship quarantined in the German port of Cuxhaven. As recently as 1 June, crew and staff aboard 20-odd cruise ships marooned in Manila Bay were reportedly clamouring to be allowed ashore. Cruises have become a symbol of the ravages that coronavirus has inflicted on tourism. A sector that until January was worth $150bn, by its own estimate, is shedding jobs, issuing debt and discounting furiously simply to survive. But even before the current crisis hit, cruising had become symptomatic of the damage that tourism wreaks on the world. Tourism is an unusual industry in that the assets it monetises – a view, a reef, a cathedral – do not belong to it. The world’s dominant cruise companies – Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian – pay little towards the upkeep of the public goods they live off. By incorporating themselves in overseas tax havens with benign environmental and labour laws – respectively Panama, Liberia and Bermuda – cruising’s big three, which account for three-quarters of the industry, get to enjoy low taxes and avoid much irksome regulation, while polluting the air and sea, eroding coastlines and pouring tens of millions of people into picturesque ports of call that often cannot cope with them. What goes for cruises goes for most of the travel industry. For decades, a small number of environmentally minded reformists in the sector have tried to develop sustainable tourism that creates enduring employment while minimising the damage it does. But most hotel groups, tour operators and national tourism authorities – whatever their stated commitment to sustainable tourism – continue to prioritise the economies of scale that inevitably lead to more tourists paying less money and heaping more pressure on those same assets. Before the pandemic, industry experts were forecasting that international arrivals would rise by between 3% and 4% in 2020. Chinese travellers, the largest and fastest-growing cohort in world tourism, were expected to make 160m trips abroad, a 27% increase on the 2015 figure. The virus has given us a picture, at once frightening and beautiful, of a world without tourism. We see now what happens to our public goods when tourists aren’t clustering to exploit them. Shorelines enjoy a respite from the erosion caused by cruise ships the size of canyons. Walkers stuck at home cannot litter mountainsides. Intricate culinary cultures are no longer menaced by triangles of defrosted pizza. It is hard to imagine a better illustration of tourism’s effects than our current holiday away from it. Coronavirus has also revealed the danger of overreliance on tourism, demonstrating in brutal fashion what happens when the industry supporting an entire community, at the expense of any other more sustainable activity, collapses. On 7 May, the UN World Tourism Organisation estimated that earnings from international tourism might be down 80% this year against last year’s figure of $1.7tn, and that 120m jobs could be lost. Since tourism relies on the same human mobility that spreads disease, and will be subject to the most stringent and lasting restrictions, it is likely to suffer more than almost any other economic activity. As tourism’s impact on the world has deepened, so the global economy has come to depend on it. Now, after the freeze forced upon foreign travel – unimaginable even six months ago – we have a rare opportunity to extract ourselves from this destructive cycle, and do things differently. * * * To accusations that it is spoiling the planet, the tourism industry responds with an economic argument: one in 10 jobs in the world depend on it. Governments tend to like tourism, because it creates jobs in the time it takes a hotel to open and the hot water to come on – and it brings in plenty of foreign money. One industry advocate I spoke to quoted Lelei Lelaulu, a development entrepreneur who, in 2007, described tourism as “the largest voluntary transfer of cash from the rich to the poor, the ‘haves’ to ‘have nots’, in history”. Even if one allows for considerable “leakage” – whereby much of tourists’ expenditure doesn’t go to the destination country but to foreign tour agencies, airlines and hotel chains whose services they use – it cannot be denied that Australians have spent liberally in Bali, Americans in Cancún and Chinese in Bangkok. At the end of January, when the flow of Chinese tourists to Europe dried up, Melissa Biggs Bradley – the founder of Indagare, a high-end US travel company, and a board member of the Center for Responsible Travel – was called by Italian colleagues who warned her: “Rome is empty. You have no idea how devastating this is going to be.” In those early days of the crisis, industry analysts reached for reassuring precedents. In 2009, international tourist arrivals fell by 4% as a result of the global financial crisis. The following year the industry roared back with 6.7% growth. After a series of terrorist attacks in Turkey in 2016, tourists stayed away, but Turkey’s loss was Spain’s gain, and the Costa Blanca experienced a surge in arrivals. ‘Rome is empty’ … the normally teeming Pantheon in April this year. Photograph: Giuseppe Fama/REX/Shutterstock It soon became clear that such comparisons were little help in understanding a global disease without a cure. In late March, Bernstein, a leading research firm, sent a note to investors that replaced an earlier, merely gloomy assessment of the hotel industry’s prospects with a properly cataclysmic one. “Just two weeks ago we considered 80% revenue declines ‘highly unlikely’, and now adopt it as our base case,” the note ran. “How naive we were!” And that was before room occupation in Spain and Italy bottomed out at 5%. Tourism accounts for around 15% of Spain’s GDP and some 13% of Italy’s. But painful though its loss is for the most diversified economies in southern Europe, it is life-threatening for tourism’s dependencies, such as the Maldives, where tourism contributes around a third of GDP, or for emerging destinations like Georgia, where visitor numbers have more than quadrupled in the past decade. In April, Edmund Bartlett, the tourism minister of Jamaica – where the industry brings in more than 50% of the island’s foreign currency – bemoaned the fact that there had been “zero arrivals for Montego Bay’s airport, zero arrivals for Kingston’s airport and zero guests in hotels … on top of the 300,000 people who are without jobs because all of the transportation systems that support tourism are at a halt, [because] the farmers who support tourism have nowhere to sell their crops, [because] the attractions … are closed.” For all the money the industry usually brings in, one of the prices of allowing a place to be taken over by tourism is the way it distorts local development. Farmers sell their land to the hotel chain, only for the price of crops they once grew to inflate beyond their reach. Water is diverted to the golf course while the locals go short. The road is paved as far as the theme park, not the school. In its subordination of an economy to a powerful, capricious, external motor, tourism dependency has something in common with the aid dependency that I observed as a reporter in Afghanistan after the 2001 invasion. In both cases, the worst threat is the possibility of sudden withdrawal. Biggs Bradley pointed to a number of “small, vulnerable” places that will be devastated, such as those islands in the Pacific that have recently become popular with diving tour operators. “They were opened up by the phenomenal rise in new air routes of recent years,” she said, only for the planes to stop arriving, leaving debt and unemployment behind. Tsotne Japaridze, whose tour agency Traffic Travel organises adventure holidays in Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia, described the pain that the virus inflicted on his business and those who rely on it. Japaridze employs three people full-time, hires 15 guides and drivers during the summer season, and sends tour groups to 30-odd vineyards, guesthouses and private houses around the country. His company can be seen as a powerful core diffusing revenue that supports hundreds of people. At the start of the crisis, Japaridze put his employees on unpaid leave (“It was a difficult decision but I had no option,” he said). As tourism vanished, demand has exploded for services that do not require customers to leave their homes. One of Japaridze’s former guides, who used to take tour groups to the beautiful Svaneti region of Georgia, is now making ends meet by delivering food on his motorbike. * * * If one danger of tourism dependency is that the tourists might suddenly stop arriving, a more common problem is overtourism – the saturation of a destination by visitors in numbers it cannot sustain. Near the peak of the pandemic, I spoke by Zoom to Jane da Mosto, whose NGO, We Are Here Venice, fights valiantly to keep the most noxiously over-touristed place on earth a tolerable place to live. While chopping vegetables for the family supper, Da Mosto confessed to a certain unease at the juxtaposition of apocalypse in Italian hospitals and the scenes of serenity and quiet observable from her window. The bridges were empty and seahorses cavorted in the Grand Canal, while peddlers of phallic-shaped pasta had been replaced by boatmen delivering homemade tortellini to the city’s residents. When Da Mosto moved out of view to attend to her potatoes, her place was occupied by her 19-year-old son, Pierangelo. From the day he first slid behind the wheel of his father’s boat, Pierangelo has lived for the water, and he feels queasy if obliged to sit in a car. He works as a carpenter and a restorer of the city’s famous keel-less boats, while also beetling about on an electric launch and showing tourists “Venice from a Venetian perspective”. A Venetian who acknowledges the importance of tourism but longs to relax its grip, Pierangelo and his friends – designers, students, fellow carpenters – had been discussing life after the virus, when, with fewer visitors, they would be faced with a steep drop in income, and would be obliged to make up the shortfall by drumming up business from local residents. And how, I asked, does he feel when he’s bobbing on the Giudecca Canal and turns to see a cruise ship bearing down on him? “Small,” Pierangelo smiled. “Very small.” Venice in June last year. Photograph: Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty Were it not for tourism, much of Venice’s Gothic fabric would have crumbled or been redeveloped years ago. But while the tourism industry provided much of the economic rationale for the preservation of the city’s architecture, power was handed to investors in hotels, restaurants and boats, many of them outsiders for whom Venice was simply a business opportunity. On 15 July 1989, the global music industry commandeered the city for a free concert, the memory of which vexes Venetians even now. As many as 200,000 people from all over Europe converged that day on the Piazza San Marco, the city’s spiritual and aesthetic core, some of them packed on to boats offshore, to see Pink Floyd on the final leg of their world tour. Panicky city councillors argued almost until the opening note of Shine on You Crazy Diamond about whether the concert should go ahead. In the end, the band agreed to lower the decibels and shorten their playlist to fit global TV schedules (Italian national broadcaster Rai did very nicely), while shopkeepers around the square sold warm beer at triple the price to fans who discovered too late that the authorities hadn’t laid on a single toilet. The following morning, the famous old flagstones were covered by cans, cigarette butts and puddles of urine. As an example of tourism squatting on the public good, an invasion of a medieval city centre by 200,000 people who pay no entry fee and leave the city to clear up their mess is hard to beat. One Italian TV report described the concert as a violation of human rights, “those of the invaders and those of the invaded”. So virulent was criticism of the city council that its members resigned en masse. Long before the invasion by rock fans, residents had been deserting the city. Between 1950 and 2019, Venice’s population dropped from about 180,000 to nearer 50,000, while the number of annual visitors rose from 1 million to 30 million. According to Jan van der Borg, a tourism specialist who teaches at Venice’s Ca’ Foscari University, and advises tourism authorities across Europe, this exceeds the city’s “carrying capacity”, the number it can accommodate without permanently damaging its infrastructure and way of life, by at least 10 million. Whether it is a gondola owner who lives far away and deputes someone else to row tourists through the packed canals, or the budget airlines that deposit thousands of tourists every day in an area barely one and a half times the size of New York’s Central Park, in Da Mosto’s words, “a huge number of people live off Venice without living in it”. And, says Van der Borg, the tourists are the wrong kind. Some 70% are day-trippers, who after being “spat from their tour buses, cruise ships and airplanes”, spend a few hours congesting the historic heart of Venice “but without contributing to its maintenance”. After parting with perhaps €15, enough to buy them a souvenir manufactured thousands of miles away, they are hurried by their guide on to their next destination. According to the unapologetic elitism that informs the thinking of Van der Borg and other industry strategists, “high-impact, low-value” excursionists should be made less welcome than the affluent independent travellers who stay in a hotel, eat at neighbourhood restaurants and perhaps round off a day in the city’s lesser-known churches with a bellini at Harry’s Bar – like Truman Capote before them. At every step, runs this line of reasoning, “quality” tourists contribute to the city’s wellbeing through taxes, tips and human interaction. So is the package holiday on the way out? According to a UK trend report by Abta in 2019, people considering their next holiday abroad were looking, above all, to spend less. If the budget holidaymaker is to be given a lukewarm welcome, British tourists have not got the hint. * * * In the past 10 years, the curse of “Venetianisation” – the hollowing out of a place, as it fills with tourist-termites – has beset city after city, as budget airlines and Airbnb have brought a weekend somewhere cobbled within reach of millions. That hasn’t just meant long-established destinations such as Venice or Paris, but sleepy coastal towns such as Porto, on Portugal’s Atlantic coast, that were completely unprepared for the numbers of tourists unleashed on them. The fightback can be dated to July 2015, when the city council in Barcelona – whose famous promenade, La Rambla, had been rendered all but impassable by the sheer number of tourists – introduced a moratorium on new hotels. The following year Airbnb was served a €600,000 fine for listing unlicensed properties – small beer for a company whose revenues from a single quarter have been known to exceed $1bn, but a sign of growing hostility towards an industry that could make a city unrecognisable to its residents in a short space of time. Last year, the mayor of Dubrovnik – whose perfectly preserved old town was overrun by visitors after it featured in the TV adaptation of Game of Thrones – shut 80% of the souvenir stalls clogging up the city centre and imposed a quota on bus and cruise tourists. The Belgian canal city of Bruges recently moved to limit the number of cruise ships docking at any one time and halted all advertising aimed at daytrippers. There is, of course, a financial cost to limiting tourism. As Fermín Villar, the president of the Friends of La Rambla, which represents the street’s residential and commercial interests, told the Guardian two years ago, “La Rambla is above all a business … every year more than 100 million people walk along this street. Imagine,” he enthused, “if each person spends only €1.” But mass tourism displaces other businesses, while the exodus of many creative and productive residents, as well as the stress placed on local infrastructure by visitors in such numbers, carry a cost of their own. Da Mosto told me that, in purely economic terms, Venice is a net loser from an industry that has set up shop on its premises and remits much of its revenues elsewhere. La Rambla in Barcelona in 2009. Photograph: JLImages/Alamy Behind the recent campaigns against over-tourism lies a growing appreciation that public goods that were assumed to be endlessly exploitable are, in fact, both finite and have a value that the price of visiting them should reflect. “Polluter pays” is an economic principle that is gradually being introduced to farming, manufacturing and energy. The idea is that if your business produces harmful side effects, then you should be the one who picks up the tab for the cleanup operation. Something similar, incorporating not only environmental harm but also wider cultural degradation or damage to way of life, might become the guiding principle of a properly sustainable tourism industry. At present the focus is centred narrowly on tourism taxes, which aim to reduce the number of tourists while also bringing in more revenue. Modest though they remain – Amsterdam adds 7% to your room bill in addition to a flat €3 per person per night – they are the tentative beginnings of a trend towards controlling tourism and turning it to the locals’ advantage, rather than the other way around. A certain nimbleness is required of companies that make money out of tourism but do not want to be seen as blind to its effects. The guide book publisher Fodor’s issues an annual “no list” of destinations that people should altruistically abstain from visiting. This year’s list features Easter Island and the Cambodian temple complex of Angkor Wat. Meanwhile Fodor’s also promotes “twenty-five places to see in the US before you die”. That list includes Big Sur, a stretch of Californian coastline that was recently festooned with a banner reading “Overtourism is killing Big Sur”. * * * Gazing at the distant profile of Mount Kenya from lightly chlorinated water in the African bush might seem like a bearable way to sit out the crisis, but the infinity pool at the Loisaba tented camp, one of three safari lodges in a 23,000-hectare reserve of the same name, hasn’t seen a swimmer in months. Less than a month after flights into the country were suspended on 25 March, Loisaba’s CEO, a Kenyan veteran of bush tourism called Tom Silvester, told me that he had laid off 90 employees, “and with each job around here carrying up to 10 dependents, that’s a big impact”. The damage done by the collapse of Kenya’s tourism industry, which is worth $1.6bn and employs 1.6 million people, is fearsome. After shuttering 24 properties across east Africa, Elewana, the hotel company that operates Loisaba’s three lodges, is drawing on cash reserves to support its 2,000-odd employees and their families. The website of another reserve, the Nashulai, is emblazoned with a plea for donations to combat starvation among the communities that rely on it. While in many places getting rid of tourists may be the only way to restore a healthy natural world, in countries where the tourist industry focuses on the environment, the opposite may be true. When I suggested to Karim Wissanji, Elewana’s CEO, that the best way to conserve Africa’s wildlife might be for human beings to migrate to the cities and leave them in peace, he retorted: “The future of our wildlife and their habitats are intrinsically linked to the future of the safari adventure industry.” Three-quarters of the 2 million foreign tourists who came to Kenya last year came for the wildlife. Were it not for tourism, many of the 160 private reserves that provide vital corridors for migrating animals and excess grazing capacity for the country’s national parks would revert to being hunting grounds or be turned over for agriculture, threatening one of the greatest concentrations of animal life in the world. Competition for grazing land, especially during times of drought, has intensified long-standing conflict between the needs of local communities and the region’s unique wildlife. As Paula Kahumbu, the CEO of conservation organisation Wildlife Direct, wrote in the Guardian, “most Kenyan youth see wildlife as irrelevant, something that benefits a few, rich visitors or white landowners”. In the wake of violent incursions on ranches and wildlife parks over the years, safari outfits have looked for ways to make tourism directly support the local population. The loss of incomes caused by the pandemic might yet precipitate disaster. On 21 April, Conservation International, a US charity that protects areas of exceptional biodiversity, reported that there has been an “alarming rise in bushmeat and ivory poaching in Kenya”. Loisaba has only been able to maintain its anti-poaching patrols thanks to a donation from The Nature Conservancy, another charity that funds and gives scientific advice for conservation projects around the world. Habitually operating at less than 40% occupancy, with just 48 beds to all those acres, you might think of Loisaba as a high-value, positive-impact answer to the daily disgorging of thousands of cruise passengers into Venice’s city centre. By paying $700 per day to enjoy the company of elephants, reticulated giraffes and an ark’s worth of other birds and mammals, Loisaba’s visitors are effectively paying to protect the wildlife from more intrusive human interventions. As Matthew Brown, The Nature Conservancy’s Africa director, put it, tourism that “tangibly contributes to conservation outcomes” is “the best way to finance biodiversity. Without it, the idea that one can protect animals and help local people quickly falls apart.” For all the money that foreigners bring to Loisaba, the reserve lacks the diversity of clientele that is an ingredient of the most resilient tourist businesses. Bush tourism in general is attracting too few of Kenya’s growing middle class – while the high cost of living keeps many at home, those who do travel for holidays tend to head for the coast. Being able to call on local customers would allow the country’s game reserves to recover faster once the current travel restrictions lapse – which will happen for African tourists sooner than for those coming from further afield. In April, Kenya’s tourism minister, Najib Balala, called for a “paradigm shift” in favour of the domestic and pan-African market. “It is no longer about waiting for international visitors to come in,” he said. “If we start now, in five years we will be resilient [in the face of] any shocks whatsoever, even travel advisories imposed by the western countries.” Tourist filming mountain gorillas in the Volcanos National Park in Rwanda, 2005. Photograph: Riccardo Gangale/AP Such a swift recovery is unlikely for the traditional stars of conservation tourism, the gorillas that are spread across national parks in Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. After coming close to extinction in the 1980s, their numbers recovered thanks to an international rescue effort funded in part by blue-chip tourism. (Americans visitors to Rwanda spend an average of around $12,000 per trip.) In 2016, the Rwandan government doubled to $1,500 the fee that tourists must pay for a single hour with the coveted primates. This had the miraculous effect of upping revenues from $15m to $19m – some of this money goes to pay rangers and fund local welfare schemes – while also reducing the number of visitors who tramp through their habitat in the Volcanoes National Park, from 22,000 to 15,000. Now that the country’s borders are shut and rich foreign tourists won’t be back for months, a new conservation strategy will be needed. From an environmental point of view, the immediate peril is that the great apes catch coronavirus. The longer-term challenge is to protect them from a rise in poaching for gorilla meat, and from getting caught in snares laid for antelopes. In June, Sheba Hanyurwa, who runs a tourism business across Uganda and Rwanda, told me that over recent years tourism revenues have allowed a certain economic diversification to take place. The relatively high salaries commanded by rangers and guides have enabled their communities to keep cows and chickens for their own needs. During the crisis, the governments of Uganda and Rwanda have maintained frequent patrols in their national parks – with greater success than the DRC, where 12 rangers were recently killed in the perennially unstable Virunga National Park. But, Hanyurwa told me, “hotel workers and porters have been laid off and people are hungry. The only livelihood here is from tourism and there won’t be any international tourists at least until next year.” Covid-19 has exposed the flaw in the model of elite tourism with a conscience. There is no plan B. * * * Not all nature-based tourism is good for the nature it is based on. As environmental awareness has grown, many businesses have adopted feel-good terms like “eco-friendly” and “green” – even though, in the words of one body that assesses tourism sustainability, “the experiences they sell are neither of these things”. Some travellers fail to notice that flying across the world to sit in a cabin sourced from illegally logged trees isn’t as eco-friendly as their Instagram feed makes out. Others balk at the cost of being good. According to a survey conducted by travel company Tui in 2017, while 84% of European holidaymakers consider it important to reduce their carbon footprint, only 11% are willing to shoulder the additional costs of a sustainable holiday over an ordinary one. Among the nations that have, in recent years, tried to build up wildlife tourism is Indonesia, home to the world’s largest lizard, the Komodo dragon. Last year, the government announced a plan to make the town of Labuan Bajo, which is currently the access point for Komodo national park’s numerous islands, into one of 10 major tourism destinations. Ominously, the government scheme is called “10 new Balis”. The idea isn’t to ease pressure on the over-touristed island of Bali, for which a major new airport is planned, but to emulate its success at attracting millions of tourists on cut-price holidays every year. In the process, Bali’s combination of heaving beaches, growing water shortages and mountains of rubbish may also be replicated at the 10 other destinations. “What was once a small fishing village is now supercharged with boom-town zeal and non-stop construction of restaurants and hotels,” reported a CNBC correspondent visiting Labuan Bajo in January. Between 2008 and 2018, the annual number of visitors to Komodo national park increased from 44,000 to 176,000. One big attraction, apart from the nature itself, is the price. After your $50 flight from Bali lands at Labuan Bajo’s new airport, I was told by Glenn Wappett, a former British serviceman who skippers yachts around eastern Indonesia, “you can stay in a hostel and take a day boat to see the dragons and still get change from $100”. That includes the roughly $12 park entry fee. Lonely Planet named the island chain that includes Komodo its “best-value destination” for 2020. (That was before the guidebook publisher was hit by the global lockdown and suspended most of its commercial activities in April.) Indonesia’s preference for mass over elite tourism has been guided by the addition of 2 million young people to the labour market each year. More tourists means more jobs. After all, even if their per-capita outlay is low, large numbers of visitors need more waiters, taxi drivers and marine guides than a handful of extravagant ones. Komodo dragons in Indonesia. Photograph: Alamy But as visitor numbers to the islands have risen, the dragon population has fallen. Mating practices were disrupted by tourists, while deer poaching depleted their main food source and logging destroyed their habitat. In 2018, Viktor Bungtilu Laiskodat, the governor of the province of East Nusa Tenggara, in which the park lies, advocated increasing the entrance fee to $500 with the aim of attracting richer tourists, reducing visitor numbers and protecting the lizards. In March 2019, after smugglers stole more than 40 Komodo dragons, his administration went a step further and announced that the island of Komodo, home to around 1,700 giant lizards, would close for the whole of 2020 to allow the reptiles, the deer they feed on and their shared habitat, to recuperate. But the governor’s attempts at conserving the region’s main attraction went down badly with many of the locals who make a living from tourism. “There was a huge backlash from dive companies, hotels and restaurants,” recalled Wappett. They demanded that tourists be allowed on Komodo, and in October, the national government overruled the governor and the plan was scrapped. The virus is succeeding where the governor of East Nusa Tenggara failed. Entry to the Komodo National Park has been barred to all but the fishing communities that inhabit it. The dragons sup on venison and fish, which, according to Wappett’s friends in the area, have returned in spectacular numbers to these overvisited waters. Still, it’s not hard to imagine what will happen once tourism becomes feasible again. On 14 April, Indonesia’s finance minister predicted that coronavirus, by freezing the tourist trade, could leave as many as 5.2 million Indonesians unemployed. Unless some alternative path for job creation can be found in the future, as soon as flights resume, tourists will be encouraged to return en masse and the dragons will once again come under threat. * * * On 7 May, the UN World Tourism Organisation suggested that the coronavirus crisis would squeeze the industry so hard that progress towards making tourism sustainable – principally by reducing overcrowding and addressing climate change – would be not just halted but reversed. Indeed, since the start of the crisis, airlines and cruise companies have been lobbying hard for tax breaks and the lifting of environmental measures. From the petrol and particulates that spew from jetskis to pesticides drenching the putting green, the holidaymaker’s every innocent pleasure seems like another blow to the poor old planet. Then there is the food left in the fridge and the chemicals used to launder the sheets after each single-night occupancy in one of Airbnb’s 7 million rental properties, and the carcinogenic fuel that is burned by cruise ships. And then there are the carbon emissions. “Tourism is significantly more carbon-intensive than other potential areas of economic development,” reported a recent study in the journal Nature Climate Change. Between 2009 and 2013, the industry’s global carbon footprint grew to about 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the majority generated by air travel. “The rapid increase in tourism demand,” the study went on, “is effectively outstripping the decarbonisation of tourism-related technology”. Destructive though it is, the virus has offered us the opportunity to imagine a different world – one in which we start decarbonising, and staying local. The absence of tourism has forced us to consider ways in which the industry can diversify, indigenise and reduce its dependency on the all-singing, all-dancing carbon disaster that is global aviation. For Komodo in Indonesia the alternative ending involves fewer visitors paying more to visit the national park while the surrounding communities develop the fishing and textile industries that have kept them going for centuries. In Georgia’s Svaneti region, where the lure of tourist dollars has drawn people to abandon animal husbandry in favour of opening guesthouses and cafes, Tsotne Japaridze told me the crisis could be a “lesson not to forget their traditional means of making a living”. Related: ‘We can’t go back to normal’: how will coronavirus change the world? More broadly, tourism must be valued not as a quickfire source of foreign exchange, but as an integrated part of a nation’s economy, subject to the same forward planning and cost-benefit analysis as any other sector. In places where tourism is too dominant, it needs to shrink. All this needs to happen in tandem with wider efforts to decarbonise society. As an international industry, tourism means nothing less than the aggregate of activities that range from building airline engines at Rolls-Royce’s plant in Derbyshire to pulling pints in the Irish pub in Montego Bay. From this global perspective, it cannot easily be planned or controlled. Its natural bosses are municipal, provincial and national governments, and it is to these institutions that responsibility for reform now falls. Some have already begun. The council in Barcelona, for example, reclaimed parts of town that had been lost to holiday lets; the governor of East Nusa Tenggara tried to price the Komodo Dragon out of danger. Such instincts to tame tourism’s excesses through taxes and pricing need to be adopted everywhere. Tourism isn’t the right that many holidaymakers, whatever their budgets, seem to think it is. It’s a luxury that needs to pay its way. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here","Id":"travel/2020/jun/18/end-of-tourism-coronavirus-pandemic-travel-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webTitle":"The end of tourism?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jun/18/end-of-tourism-coronavirus-pandemic-travel-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2020/jun/18/end-of-tourism-coronavirus-pandemic-travel-industry","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":5678,"webPublicationDate":"2020-06-18T05:00:41Z","id":"travel/2020/jun/18/end-of-tourism-coronavirus-pandemic-travel-industry","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"‘Our island is like a mosaic’: how migrants are reshaping Sicily’s food culture","body":"Shapoor Safari left Kabul in 1996 after the mujahideen knocked on his door and tried to order him into their ranks. He fled first to Pakistan, then to Iran where he washed cars and learned to solder metal, then to Turkey, where he worked in a bread factory, putting mini brioches on the conveyor belt to go into the ovens. Two friends told him there was a boat going to Italy. He paid $3,000 for his place. “It was 2002. It was the first boat to go to Italy,” he told me without pride. “There were 150 of us. Afghans, Pakistanis, Iranians, even a few Iraqis. Men, women, families, children also. On the second day, food and water ran out. The crew gave some biscuits to the children. On the third day, the captain began to sell bottles of water for $100.” On the fourth day, there was a storm and the engine stopped and the boat heaved violently in the waves for three hours, until they got it started again. On the fifth day, they were rescued by the Italian navy and taken to a camp in Calabria. In those days, the numbers of migrants and refugees was far fewer, processing was faster. In two or three months, Safari had documents allowing him to work. Students learn to cook at the Astalli Centre for migrants in Palermo. Photograph: Alex Majoli / Magnum Photos/The Observer For seven years, he travelled all over Italy: Milan, Turin, Rome, Venice. He took jobs in supermarkets, as a dishwasher, making pizza; one summer, he picked olives, another tomatoes. But he never managed to get a permanent contract. He was alone. He looked at the map, saw Sicily being “kicked” by the Italian boot, and got on a train to Palermo. There, he seemed to find his feet. He worked for a year in the kitchen of the Teatro Massimo, from morning until midnight, earning €25 a day. Then he left and went to work in other restaurant kitchens, watching, learning, cooking. Food is as much, or more, about identity, memory and family as it is about sustenance. Sicily’s history is one of successive empires, “dominations” as Sicilians term them – Greek, Phoenician, Roman, Byzantine, Gothic, Arab, Norman, Spanish, and most recently, Sicilians laugh, Italian – that have come ashore and into its cooking pots. Safari told me: “Palermo is different, I feel here people are looking forward to meeting new people. Sicily,” he added laughing, “is not Europe!” Its culture comes as much from its position as a Mediterranean island as it does from its inclusion in a relatively recent Italian union. Palermo’s mayor, Leoluca Orlando, likes to say that it is a Middle Eastern city that happens to be in the EU. The sweet and sour taste of Eastern agrodolce is key to its cuisine. Its most famous dishes are pasta con le sarde, a sardine sauce often made with capers and raisins, and almond granita, the descendent of an Ottoman sherbet. Levantine pine nuts, pistachios and sesame seeds are generously scattered over gelato or spaghetti. In Palermo, couscous with fish is a staple family dish. Since the Arab Spring in 2011, the fall of Gaddafi and the subsequent breakdown of law and order in Libya, roughly 400,000 migrants have crossed the Mediterranean and landed in southern Italy and Sicily. The majority are young African men, but before them came Bangladeshis and Tamils; in the 1990s, Tunisians came over to work in the fields. As much as the recent African influx comes with political, ethnic, economic and even criminal complications, there is a part of Sicilian tradition that identifies with the new arrivals. Sicily has always been an island of immigrants and, in the 20th century, of emigrants. How, I wondered, given this background, are the more recent migrants encountering a new continent around Sicilian tables and integrating in its kitchens?

Photograph: Alex Majoli / Magnum Photos/The Observer Safari is now head chef at Moltivolti in Palermo, half-restaurant and half a shared space for NGOs working with migrants, a utopian bubble in the midst of a big city and a bigger issue. His kitchen team comprises a Sardinian, two Senegalese and an Iraqi. The menu is international: from Sicily, pasta with swordfish and aubergine or broccoli, anchovies and raisins, or artichokes and bottarga; Italian lasagne; hummus from Jordan; tabbouleh from Lebanon; falafel from Palestine; Argentinian sweet potato; Iraqi kebab with pumpkin; and Tunisian brik with tuna. “Do you like cooking?” I asked. At this question, finally, Safari smiled. “When I am in the kitchen, when I am cooking or teaching people – it is messy and people are stirring and arguing, I feel the same as I did with my family all around.” Moltivolti lies at the heart of the Ballarò neighbourhood of Palermo. Alleyways strung with washing wind into piazzas overlooked by crumbling madonnas. For many years, Ballarò was a dilapidated, clannish ghetto, increasingly depopulated as families moved to airier suburbs. Several years ago, new arrivals began renting here and now the area is an extraordinary mix of mafia, migrants and hip young social entrepreneurs. In the market that runs like a spine through the neighbourhood, Bangladeshi groceries sell cassava, okra, scotch bonnet chillies and mangoes beside stalls piled with springtime artichokes and still-warm ricotta, while Sicilians yell the virtues of flashing silver sardines, lemon granita and freshly fried chickpea fritters, known as panelle. “We are in the middle here,” Claudio Arestivo, one of the co-founders of Moltivolti, told me, “I feel we are living an experiment.” Not far from Moltivolti is the Astalli Centre for migrants, housed in several buildings built around a gothic cloister. “The Jesuits help us a lot,” Emanuele Cardella, the director, told me. (In Ballarò, and all over Sicily, the Catholic church is active in providing frontline services for migrants). Cardella gave me a tour of the classrooms and workshops where they give lessons in computer science, Italian, English, tailoring, carpentry, ceramics, and the dining room where they feed 100 people every day for breakfast. In the kitchen, Cardella explained, they have also run a cooking course for several months, for 10 or 12 migrants at a time. He showed me photographs of several groups, smiling for the camera in front of the centre’s stoves: women and men, headscarves and beards. “Afghan women, people from Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Ghana, Morocco, Tunisia.” Preparing lasagne, Moltivolti-style. Photograph: Alex Majoli / Magnum Photos/The Observer The course deliberately features half Italian and half foreign cuisine. “I discovered tikka masala!” Cardella told me, kissing his fingertips enthusiastically. “It’s great! It is amazing the infinity of combinations of new tastes to discover. If we mix different cultures, we increase exponentially our discovery of new taste. It’s amazing to see, for example, a Nigerian cook discover Indian spices.” I met Ricardo Pizzuto and Samuel Torres, who oversee the cooking class, as they were teaching a group of children to sing the Italian national anthem accompanied by bongo drums. Pizzuto said he had never explained a new technique or a new ingredient without someone from the class finding a correlation to their own culinary background. I told them that I had seen three aubergine dishes on the menu at Moltivolti – baba ganoush, caponata and a dish of aubergine with mint, parmesan and eggs described as Lebanese. I half-joked that they were more or less the same thing, but Torres shook his head. “No,” he said, with conviction. “They are different. If we mix them, we lose their identity.” I began to see that the Sicilian model of integration as less a melting pot of assimilation than as layers of different cultures, each distinct and delicious, what a third-generation pastry-maker described to me, pointing at a millefeuille, as “stratificazione”. “We are just like a mosaic,” mayor Orlando told me, proudly, adding another metaphor. Despite an “Italians first” rhetoric gaining traction and votes in the March national elections, Italy’s shift to the right on immigration issues has been less pronounced in the south and Sicily. The new interior minister recently visited the island and declared he’d had enough of Sicily being “the refugee camp of Europe”, and told migrants: “Get ready to pack your bags.” Mayor Orlando responded in a written statement: “We are severely worried about declarations which sound like propaganda slogans, that can compromise the well-established culture of welcoming and human rights respect of all, without splitting citizens with labels such as ‘locals’ and ‘migrants’.” Orlando has long championed migration as a human right and has launched a movement to abolish the residency permit. Just as prohibition gave rise to gangsters and cartel violence accompanies the drug trade, Orlando argues that limiting people’s freedom of movement creates the opportunity for criminal enterprise. “Our project is to be different but to be equal,” he told me in April. “To be different because we are human beings. To be equal because we are human beings.” Growing produce in Ballarò neighbourhood. Photograph: Alex Majoli / Magnum Photos/The Observer The juxtaposition is evident walking along the Via Maqueda, the Roman road that runs along the meridian of the city, where Bangladeshis fry samosas and pakoras between gelato shops and pizzerias. Side alleys ring with the clatter and chatter of informal front-room restaurants set up by Senegalese women have set up kitchens in their apartments. The woman behind one of these, Ami Fall, served up great mounds of maafe (spicy peanut stew) and yassa fish with onions when I ate there one lunchtime with three teenagers from Gambia, Guinea and Senegal who had been in Sicily only a few months and were finding it hard to get used to a diet of pasta. Fall has been in Palermo for more than 15 years and now cooks pasta al forno, lasagne, Moroccan couscous. “My children eat everything!” she said, laughing as a woman with curly blond hair poked her head around the door and said “Salve!” “Hey!” replied Fall. “How’s your mother doing?” “Not well.” “I’m so sorry!” Fall turned back to me. “It’s like family here, she is a neighbour, just like a sister, she helps the kids with their homework.” “I’m going to get a crepe,” called the neighbour. “Do you want one?” “Some Sicilians are really like Africans!” Fall said, laughing. As much as people are different, they can’t help mixing, especially when they eat. One afternoon at Moltivolti I met Safa Neji, who had come to see her Iraqi chef friend. Her family had moved to Sicily from Tunisia more than 20 years ago, she has an Italian passport and goes back often to visit relatives. “My grandfather complains when my mother makes him couscous,” she laughed. “He says she has lost her Tunisian-ness and makes it in the Sicilian way.” I asked her if she felt Tunisian or Sicilian, realising, even as I said it, that it was a crass question. “I am me,” she said simply. “There is no difference between Palermo and north Africa. Tunisia,” she pointed, as if towards the next neighbourhood, “is right here.” ‘Arabs brought the first lemons a thousand years ago. Spanish brought tomatoes from the New World’ Neji showed me photographs of the feast she and her mother had prepared to celebrate her graduation. There were two tables, each covered with a red tablecloth, side by side. One was laid out with Tunisian food: a mound of couscous with chickpeas, carrots laid against the ramparts, meat on a separate platter, fried brik triangles, Tunisian frittata “which is similar to the Sicilian but has parsley”. The second table was laid with Italian food: small pizzas and tarts with tomatoes and courgettes, everything on the Italian side was speared with a toothpick. I said it was interesting that even the method of eating, traditionally with your hands, on the Tunisian table and on the Italian, with an implement, was separate but equally represented. Neji nodded and, laughing, said she and her mother always liked to eat with their hands when they were in Tunisia, but grandfather would admonish them, as if it were something a bit retrograde. While young Sicilians are interested in the spicy new flavours, their parents tend to retain a more conservative palate. But traditions evolve: I met several migrants who worked as housekeepers and cooked for middle-class Sicilian families, learning family favourites and introducing their own recipes. Ambi Aram from Mauritius – another multiracial island, where Indians, Africans and Chinese have influenced local dishes – told me she cooks curries for the family she works for – “They like it hot and spicy!” – and often adds ginger to the Italian soffrito of onions and garlic. “I modify. I invent. Happiness is when we get to know another tradition, another taste.” This melding and blurring is also taking place in restaurant kitchens, where plenty of migrants have found jobs. At one of the mayor’s favourite trattorias, Il Pipino Rosso, housed in the medieval brick alcoves of a 14th-century palazzo, the owners were so impressed with a Syrian chef who put falafel and tabbouleh on the menu that they are in the process of opening a Syrian restaurant with him in a village outside the city. Their Bangladeshi pizzaiolo, Sheikh Al Mamun, told me he sometimes makes dishes using Indian spices, adding turmeric and ginger to the minestrone, for example. The new chef, Tizziana Allegri, was excited: “It’s beautiful, Sicilians are very open to new tastes. Here people find different flavours.” And one evening, I had dinner in a typically Sicilian trattoria, one I found by chance, and saw on the menu, amid the classics, pasta alla norma, pasta with pistachios, pesto Trapanese made with almonds, and “gnocchi with swordfish, salmon shrimp and curry”. A student on one of the Astalli Centre’s cookery courses. Photograph: Alex Majoli / Magnum Photos/The Observer When I told Sicilians that curry-pasta was creeping into their culinary repertoire, they were sceptical. But cross-cultural pollination is unavoidable. “I think all the world is mixing food because more people are coming, there is immigration, and people are travelling more, too,” Patrizia di Benedetto, the chef of the Michelin-starred Bye Bye Blues told me. For the celebrations of a local saint’s day last year, at Moltivolti they made arancini, fried rice balls, with a maafe sauce. At the Astalli Centre the chef, Ricardo, makes a ragu with Indian spices. “Sicily is a triangle,” Bonetta dell’Oglio, the chef, slow-food activist and author explained, pointing to the tattoo of the outline of the island on her forearm. “It is divided into three valleys by three mountain ranges.” One, she explained, looked towards Italy, one towards Africa, one towards Tunisia and the Maghreb. “All of these places and dominations enriched our culture.” Dell’Oglio had invented “sushiliana”, using couscous instead of rice and fish marinated in orange, lemon, white wine, salt and sugar and wrapped in a sheet of nori, to show that new concepts could be created with Sicilian flavours. For the wasabi, she made a paste of red chilli peppers. After all, she told me, many ingredients considered Sicilian were once foreign. “The Arabs brought the first citrus, lemons and oranges and mandarins, a thousand years ago. The Spanish brought peppers and tomatoes from the New World. Tomatoes only really arrived 200 years ago. Before that, they were more ornamental plants, people didn’t trust them. Think how quickly tomatoes have become part of almost every aspect of Sicilian cuisine.” Related: Francis and Mary, the migrant love story that ended in tragedy At Moltivolti one evening, they held a cooking class for a group of 40 students from Rotterdam studying cultural economics and entrepreneurship. They made traditional Sicilian cannoli, what was described as “Zambian polenta” – a cornmeal dish called nshima – and then Safari showed everyone how to make dumplings. He told his story through the ingredients. The spice mix of coriander, cumin, cardamom, garlic and pepper are his Afghanistan home; the flour reminds him of the Turkish bakery; the yogurt is from Iran; and the liquid to bind recalls his time on the boat when he learned the value of every single drop. One of the Dutch professors watched as a long tongue of dough rolled through the pasta machine and was taken up by many hands as everyone cheered. “And what is better than cooking together, hearing different stories?” he said.","Id":"world/2018/jun/17/our-island-is-like-a-mosaic-how-migrants-are-reshaping-sicilys-food-culture","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"‘Our island is like a mosaic’: how migrants are reshaping Sicily’s food culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/our-island-is-like-a-mosaic-how-migrants-are-reshaping-sicilys-food-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/our-island-is-like-a-mosaic-how-migrants-are-reshaping-sicilys-food-culture","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":2625,"webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T10:30:11Z","id":"world/2018/jun/17/our-island-is-like-a-mosaic-how-migrants-are-reshaping-sicilys-food-culture","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Eat, pray, pizza: London’s slice of the Neapolitan revolution","body":"Is L’Antica Pizzeria da Michele the best pizzeria in the world? No – it is far bigger than that. Which explains the hysteria surrounding the opening of this Italian institution’s third branch outside Naples, after Tokyo and Rome. It opens on Friday in Stoke Newington, London. Expect the queues to be long. There is a reason: da Michele is the restaurant where Julia Roberts’s character in Eat Pray Love enters into a relationship with a margherita pizza. While there are dozens of old-school pizzerias in the historic centre of Naples with hardcore followings for soft-cored Neapolitan pizza, da Michele has asserted itself, generation after generation, as a paragon of purism. “L’Antica Pizzeria da Michele perfectly represents the Neapolitan tradition,” says Antonio Mattozzi, author of Inventing the Pizzeria: A History of Pizza Making in Naples. It all started in 1870 when Salvatore Condurro received his licence to make pizza. He prepared and sold pizza fritta (deep-fried pizza) on the street outside his home in Naples. His son, Michele, opened the family’s first pizzeria in 1906. With the words “Il tempio della pizza” (the temple of pizza) etched on the backs of their white polos, today, the da Michele bakers uphold not so much an ideal pizza as a pizza ideal: Neapolitan-style pizza as it was in the heart of its ancestral homeland – unplugged, unembellished and uncorrupted. Julia Roberts, as Elizabeth Gilbert, eats pizza at L’Antica Pizzeria da Michele. Their handcrafted pizzas are more biomorphic than circular, with a distorted shape and uneven distribution of toppings. The defining constant is a diameter larger than that of the plate beneath it, otherwise known as pizza a ruota di carro (“cartwheel pizza”). The pizzaioli are capable of making perfectly round pizzas, and sometimes they do. Accidents like that happen. But mostly they just don’t get bogged down with superficial details or showmanship. When it comes to the perfect Neapolitan pizza, it’s all about the base. Subjected to one minute of 500C heat in a wood-fired oven, the pizza at da Michele acquires more black spots than a leopard. The dark clusters (crucially, without a crunchy texture or burnt taste) around the cornicione, a pizza’s puffed rim, are the markings of rustic, low-tech baking. While charring typically turns bread crisp and dry, the interior of this crust is soft and steamy. To prevent sagging and even collapse, the pizza must be handled with knowing, loving hands – the baker’s as well as the eater’s. The Neapolitan-style has caught fire in the UK already, with Italian and British-born traders alike embracing its aura of authenticity. This pizza renaissance traces back to 2008, when Giuseppe Mascoli founded Franco Manca, in London’s Brixton Market. Now there are 29 Franco Mancas nationwide serving soft-crusted, wood-fired pizza, including a branch in Stoke Newington – 0.3 miles from da Michele. Britain’s embrace of the Naples pizza school – as opposed to the regional styles of Rome, Verona, Sicily or such capitals of the pizza diaspora as New York, Detroit or Buenos Aires – poses risks and rewards for da Michele. Franco Manca was founded by Giuseppe Mascoli in 2008. Photograph: Michelle Grant/Rex/Shutterstock The Condurro family may be heartened to discover that Londoners already know and appreciate this kind of pizza. Their customers won’t need to be initiated into the pleasures of a bendy crust, rather than a rigid one better equipped to support layer upon layer of unctuous toppings. But with this familiarity comes pressure to hold London’s interest. As a latecomer to London’s pizza roots movement, da Michele will not be crowned Neapolitan pizza king by acclamation, nor by virtue of doing something terribly new or unusual. Its claim to fame here, as in Naples, will be same old, same old. As such, the menu in London, as at home, will be limited to two classic pizzas: the margherita, with tomato, fior di latte (cow’s milk mozzarella) and basil; and the marinara, with tomato, oregano and garlic. The Condurros were pondering the unthinkable: adding a third pizza, possibly a rotated special. In the end, they decided to stick with the limited menu that got them where they are. Beyond the initial period of curiosity, success at da Michele’s London branch may ultimately depend on a single factor: whether its Neapolitan pizza is truly distinct from the versions at top-notch London joints such as Santa Maria in Ealing and Fulham, Addommè in Streatham Hill or Sud Italia at Spitalfields. Time will tell if the Condurros will stick stubbornly and, many would add, admirably to their two-pizza dictum or perhaps start to incorporate local, British-made ingredients, as the likes of Franco Manca have. The question is: would adding new options to the menu merely betray a lack of faith in Londoners to appreciate proper pizza without embellishment? • Daniel Young of youngandfoodish.com is author of Where to Eat Pizza: The Experts’ Guide to the Best Pizza Places in the World.

As a result, signature creations such as his margherita sbagliata (“mistaken margherita”) or sensazioni di costiera (“sensations of the coast”) are master-pizzas of destiny. 2 Pizzarium, Italy Via della Meloria, 43 Cipro-Ottaviano, Rome, Lazio 00136 Gabriele Bonci is the Michelangelo of pizza al taglio – the rectangular, “by the cut”, ready-to-go pizza displayed in bakery-like window cases throughout Rome. At Pizzarium, the pizza selection is so vast and impressive there is almost a risk of it distracting from the singular experience of Bonci’s divinely airy crust and its compression to the chew. 3 50 Kalò di Ciro Salvo, Italy Piazza Sannazaro 201B, Mergellina, Naples, Campania 80122 The glamour permeating 50 Kalò reflects the freshly elevated status of pizza in Naples. Its dough yields an incomparably light, supple crust – a flawless platform for the very best pizza sourcing and baking technique. 4 I Tigli, Italy Via Camporosolo 11, San Bonifacio, Veneto 37047 Before I Tigli only Michelin chefs and sushi masters worked with tweezers; not pizzaioli. Applying impeccable raw materials with meticulous craftsmanship, Simone Padoan has transformed pizza into a refined finger food. The Italian press call it pizza gourmet. Padoan introduced sashimi to pizza and created a brioche pizza dough to replace the toast for foie gras. 5 Pizzeria Bianco, USA 623 E Adams St, Phoenix, Arizona 85004 When, in 1988, Chris Bianco began making pizzas in a grocery store, Phoenix, Arizona was not yet Margheritaville USA. With know-how developed in New York and Italy, supplies from local producers and homemade mozzarella, Bianco crafted the touchstone for artisanal pizza. He is a hero to DIY pizza geeks with woodfired ovens everywhere. 6 Pizzaria la Notizia, Italy Via Michelangelo da Caravaggio, 53 Mergellina, Naples, Campania 80126 Enzo Coccia can lecture on dough hydration, or rhapsodise over the stretchy mozzarella clinging to a pizza as a slice of it is pulled away. It is this delicious paradox that makes La Notizia so remarkable: you can order an inventive pizza with stunning ingredients and appreciate it was conceived by a master, or choose a classic, cheesy margherita and know it was prepared by a scholar who is a kid at heart. 7 L’Antica Pizzeria da Michele, Italy Via Cesare Sersale 1-3 Forcella, Naples, Campania 80139 Da Michele is part pizza temple and part pizza time machine. Its mystique rests on the resolve of Michele Condurro, the legendary stickler who opened the pizzeria in 1906, and his heirs to limit the selection to two classic pizzas, the margherita and the marinara. Free-form pizzas too big for their plates, or boxes, are perfect in their rustic imperfection. 8 Bæst, Denmark Guldbergsgade 29, Copenhagen, Hovedstaden 2200 The charred pizza crust at the stylish Italian restaurant opened by Michelin-starred chef Christian Puglisi is delicately crunchy outside and divinely soft inside – a perfect base for house-made organic charcuterie and cheeses, including hand-stretched mozzarella. 9 Roberta’s, USA 261 Moore Street, Brooklyn, New York The utter excitement of finding something new and edgy in the grimmest reaches of the city is part of every bohemian counterculture. What’s unique about Roberta’s rise from the cinderblocks of Bushwick, Brooklyn is that its fame came not from painting, poetry or punk rock, but from pizza. Fittingly, the spicy pizzas wear lots of black, acquired in the wood-fired blaze. 10 Bráz, Brazil Rue Graúna 125, Moema, São Paulo Bráz upholds the immigrant traditions of São Paolo, one of the world’s great pizza capitals.

Welcome to the Las Vegas Expo","body":"The world’s biggest pizza trade fair is not held in Naples or even Rome, but Las Vegas. Here 8,000 of the world’s pizzerati gather to catch up with friends, spy on the opposition and seek marginal competitive advantages. They attend seminars called things like “Pizza Crust Boot Camp, Part 1: Technical” or “Menu Labelling: Is It Right For You?” What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, except if it is crust innovation. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, except if it is crust innovation Pizza Pilgrims, as you might guess from the name, has previous for devotional peregrination. In 2011, brothers Thom and James Elliot decided to quit their jobs and get into pizza. They bought a three-wheeled Piaggio Ape van, stuck a pizza oven in the back and drove to southern Italy with a TV crew in tow. A regular market stall and a cookbook followed, before a permanent site in Soho. Theirs is Neapolitan pizza: cooked for a very short time at a very high temperature, usually with only a few toppings, where the sauce and dough are as important as the cheese. Five years later, the Pilgrims have just opened their sixth London restaurant, with plans to expand out of the capital. As the business has grown, their problems have changed. At their busiest site, off Carnaby Street, they can make up to 1,200 pizzas a day. They know how to make pizza; the challenge now is how to grow while maintaining the standards of the first few. Upper crust: sample slice cutting at the Pizza Expo. Photograph: Ed Cumming “If we can save three seconds per pizza, that’s an hour per day,” Thom explains, examining a new sauce spoon, as we amble down the aisles in the vast convention centre. At regular walking pace, a lap around the perimeter took nearly 15 minutes. There are hundreds of stalls. There are multi-slice cutters, heated boxes, dough conditioners, dough mixers, vending machines, pizza trousers. Extra-long salamis, extra-sweet tomatoes, extra-gloopy mozzarella. Some are dystopian: a camera system to monitor the proportions of toppings for paranoid owners. One specific problem for the Pilgrims is boxes. Neapolitan pizza, with its thin base and relatively liquid toppings, is notoriously hard to transport – unlike Domino’s, say, which as James explains was “designed in a lab to be delivered”. Neapolitan pizza needs a box that lets steam out, doesn’t get soggy and stays hot. “If we can find a box that keeps our pizza hot 10% longer,” says Thom, “the whole trip will have been worth it.” At last they find one which claims to use sog-resistant “virgin grade craft paper”. On a mission: brothers Thom (left) and James Elliot who founded Pizza Pilgrims. Photograph: Ed Cumming Visiting an event of this size holds practical challenges of its own. Soon after we arrive we bump into Scott Wiener, known professionally as Scott the Pizza Guy. Not a slow talker, Scott gives pizza tours of New York, and boasts the world’s largest collection of pizza box art. He attends Pizza Expo every year and offers some advice. There’s a Mel Brooks quote, which is that ‘pizza is like sex – even when it’s bad, it’s good’ “Carry a bottle of water. Familiarise yourself with the restrooms and take some trail mix – you’re going to need the protein. Oh, and don’t eat the samples unless you really need to.” At the end of the day, trying to sleep with 22 slices churning in my stomach, I will think back on this advice and wonder why I chose to ignore it. The previous day, visiting a high-street pizza joint on the Strip, the Pilgrims explained what they look for. “You want leoparding on the crust (or cornicione, in Italian) – spots of dark and brown,” says James. “Like a pitta, the crust should puff up when it goes into the oven. The tomatoes should be San Marzano.” Pile them high: some of the hundreds of varieties available at the Pizza Expo. Photograph: Ed Cumming “Ideally the mozzarella is fior di latte, and it should poach in the tomato sauce,” adds Thom. “It shouldn’t be brown, or yellow – that means it’s burnt, or the oil has leaked into the sauce. Too much black on the crust or underside of the base means burning. Cheese is a particularly tricky issue.” 'The innovation in pizza isn't really the food,' says James, as we waddle out into the white light of a Nevada afternoon It’s not until the end of the afternoon that Thom addresses the question that has been hanging over the vast exhibition hall, the Damoclean slice. “There’s a Mel Brooks quote, which is that ‘pizza is like sex – even when it’s bad, it’s good’,” he says. “That’s true. Pizza is never a disaster. With burgers you can have a real disaster, but you rarely put a pizza in your mouth and find it completely disgusting.” “The innovation in pizza is not really the food,” says James, as we waddle out into the white light of a Nevada afternoon. “You can’t really mess with mozzarella and tomato and flour,” adds Thom, “but you can discover they grow better tomatoes in California than in Italy,” he says. “Just because it started in Naples doesn’t mean it can’t be improved on.” Back at the hotel, as I wait for a couple of Rennies to work, it occurs to me that another fatty, carby pizza is not necessarily the foodstuff one should expect to be enjoying at such a moment, but in other ways it makes perfect sense. Pizza is personal and endlessly customisable. Whatever your diet, there’s a pizza for it: the consensus at the expo is that gluten-free will be the next big trend. But I don’t have long to reflect. Thom and James have heard about an Evel Knievel-themed pizza restaurant they simply have to check out. They’re not really pilgrims, I realise. Pilgrimages come to an end.","Id":"global/2017/may/14/who-says-naples-knows-pizza-best-welcome-to-the-las-vegas-expo","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webTitle":"Who says Naples knows pizza best?

A few years ago, she wrote an article in the New York Times called Seduced By Naples in which she describes her enduring love for the city, and how, when living in Rome, she would often escape to Naples – “a surefire adrenaline rush, a slap in the face, a semi-failed state only an hour south by train”. Naples had slapped me some years before I read the article – it was the city I arrived in when I first came to Italy – but her words persist, as good writing can, and tempt me. It takes an hour and six minutes to get from Roma Termini to Napoli Central if you catch the Frecciarossa, which I did, leaving a recuperating five-year-old and patient partner watching The Incredibles, beside them a floor fan with a death rattle. “The last train back is at 9:37pm,” Vincenzo reminded me as I closed the front door. “The one after that is 1am,” echoed down the lift shaft with me. Related: Devilishly good: an Italian spatchcock chicken recipe | A Kitchen in Rome There is nothing like a train journey with a good book, your eyes on the page, but also aware of the world flashing past. The 60 pages reread, and mind now on a Napoli-style charity dinner I was going to help cook in London the next day, I flipped back through the book. References to food punctuate My Brilliant Friend, but in a restrained way – lean details such as the “yellow peach” given to Elena by her dad – which turns out to be a revealing part of Ferrante’s lucid and compelling storytelling. As I walked around the ancient heart of the city on Sunday, all the details were there: a woman washing vegetables, the yellow peach, the scent of frying pizza and so much fruit on a hot day. All this mingled with the the kids on the hot steps, washing; almost violent beauty, breeze blowing in from the sea. “What a sea... the waves rolled in like blue metal tubes carrying an egg white foam on their peaks, then broke in a thousand glittering splinters”. Then we have Pasquale, the son of a carpenter, in a hat made of newspaper, in the sun, eating greens and sausages during his lunch break. The greens Ferrante mentions are no doubt friarielli. Known as broccoletti in Rome, cime di rapa in Puglia and rapini in Tuscany, friarielli are a slightly bitter cooking green related to both broccoli and turnip tops, with softly spiky leaves and scattered clusters of broccoli-like buds. Opinions and thoughts about how best to prepare these greens are strongly held, and nowhere more than Napoli, where they are often cooked with sausages. As we prepare the dinner in east London a day later, Paolo, the Neapolitan chef at Campania & Jones just off London’s Columbia Road, warns me never to boil friarielli. Trim rigorously to get rid of tough bits, he continues, then cook them in lots of oil, with chilli, garlic and white wine until tender, then add the sausages. Not that we have friarielli. It is not the season. But with Ferrante in mind we are cooking greens with sausages. Tenderstem broccoli can tolerate a par boil. We re-cook the florets with olive oil, garlic and chilli until tender – a good bed for meaty sausages. Paolo also prepares tortelli stuffed with aubergine, sartus of rice that seem like little red sandcastles in a puddle of tomato sea, fried dough balls called zeppole, and marinated vegetables. A good cook is a curious one and never too proud to learn something new, he reminds me, then laughs. The small kitchen and back room are overflowing with goodness: crates of date-shaped tomatoes, cherries, bulbous onions the colour of a bishop’s cassock. Two caprese (chocolate torte) balance on a window ledge, sloshing tubs of putty-coloured batter and wet dough. Containers are brimming with grilled aubergine slices in olive oil. The stove seems alive, sputtering: “Passing by you caught a whiff of spices, of olives and salami, of fresh bread, of pork fat and crackling that made you hungry.” And not just for food. Sausages and greens Serves 4 800g broccoli 6-8 tbsp olive oil 1-2 garlic cloves A small red chilli, finely chopped Salt White wine (optional) 4–8 pork sausages 1 If you are using broccoli, romanesco, sprouting broccoli or tenderstem, trim and cut into florets, then parboil. If you are using broccoletti, friarielli or rapini, just trim away all the tough parts. 2 Warm the oil in a large frying pan. Peel and crush the garlic for a milder flavour; chop it for a fiercer one – then add to the pan with the broccoli, chilli and a pinch of salt. The par-boiled broccoli will need a few minutes until is is ready. Uncooked greens will need longer – and possibly some wine and time under a lid. It should be tender and tangled in the end. 3 Keep an eye on the greens and taste now and then. Cook the sausages in another frying pan or under the grill, then unite them with the greens and leave to mingle for a bit. Serve hot or at room temperature, with bread ... possibly wearing a paper hat.

Head there for the latest global coronavirus news: Related: Coronavirus live news: Brazil deaths exceed known China toll as US infections pass 1 million 12.13am BST Three US children with the coronavirus being treated for rare inflammatory syndrome Three US children infected with the coronavirus are being treated for a rare inflammatory syndrome that appears similar to one that has raised concerns by doctors in Britain, Italy and Spain, Reuters reports. All three children - who range in age from 6 months to 8 years - have undergone treatment at Columbia University Medical Centre in New York, and all had fever and inflammation of the heart and the gut. “Right now, we’re at the very beginning of trying to understand what that represents,” Columbia’s Dr Mark Gorelik told Reuters. Italian and British medical experts are investigating a possible link between the coronavirus pandemic and clusters of Kawasaki disease, a severe inflammatory disease among infants arriving in hospitals with high fevers and swollen arteries. The syndrome has been largely undetected in the United States, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Gorelik said he believes the cases are likely not Kawasaki disease, but a similar process that shares an underlying mechanism with Kawasaki, which is thought to be triggered by an infectious agent that sparks an immune response. 11.48pm BST Summary Known global death toll exceeds 215,000. According to the Johns Hopkins researchers, at least 3,110,219 people have been infected worldwide and at least 216,808 have died since the outbreak began. The numbers are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing testing and recording systems around the world. US passes 1 million confirmed cases. The country, by far the world’s worst affected, reaches the milestone of 1 million confirmed cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US death toll is now at more than 57,000 people. Confirmed deaths in Brazil exceed known Chinese toll. Brazil’s total number of confirmed deaths overtakes the WHO’s figure for China as cases accelerate in Latin America’s biggest country. UK reports 586 more deaths. The heath secretary, Matt Hancock, says the country has suffered 586 more deaths, bringing the total death toll in British hospitals to 21,678. Portugal to end state of emergency. The country’s president announces that its state of emergency will end at the weekend. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa says the third such 15-day period will end at midnight on Saturday and “we hope it will not be necessary to use it again in the future”. Spain outlines ‘plan for transition to normality’. The Spanish government sets out details of its lockdown strategy, as the country’s daily death toll continues to decline and the rate of contagion falls. 12,000 BA staff face redundancy. British Airways sets out plans to make as many as 12,000 of its staff redundant due to the global collapse in air travel caused by the pandemic.

Pence triggered a storm of controversy on Tuesday by failing to wear a face mask on a visit to the facilities. Pence leads the US government’s coronavirus taskforce, but his staff have claimed he does not need to wear the protective covering because he is regularly tested for the coronavirus: Updated at 11.56pm BST 11.33pm BST My colleague Sam Levin has this story: Iranian scientist in Ice detention tests positive for Covid-19 An Iranian scientist who has been pleading for weeks to be released from a US immigration jail due to his fragile health has contracted Covid-19, according to his family and attorneys. Dr Sirous Asgari, a materials science and engineering professor who spoke out in March about the unsanitary and “inhumane” conditions in detention, was placed in an isolation cell this week inside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) jail in Louisiana. His lawyers learned on Tuesday that his Covid-19 test was positive. He and his family are calling for his release to a medical facility where he can receive proper care.

Updated at 11.45pm BST 11.10pm BST Doctors on the frontline also widely believe that the real numbers are much higher – one factor being people dying at home. Speaking on condition of anonymity, one medic in Rio de Janeiro state said three patients who were intubated after testing positive using faster, less accurate serological tests died during his overnight shift last weekend at a public hospital in the town of Nova Iguaçu. If one doctor saw this (in one night) I think it’s unlikely the number for the whole of Brazil is 474. 10.28pm BST Confirmed deaths in Brazil surpass known Chinese toll Brazil’s total number of confirmed deaths has now overtaken the WHO’s figure for China as cases accelerate in Latin America’s biggest country. On Tuesday, the Brazilian health ministry reported 474 deaths over the previous 24 hours, taking the total to 5,017 – more than China, where the virus was first reported and which has seen 4,643 deaths so far, according to the WHO. Brazil now has 71,886 confirmed cases after adding 5,385 in the last 24 hours, though widespread underreporting and a generalised lack of tests means numbers are almost definitely much higher. The G1 news site reported on Tuesday that deaths in São Paulo are 168% more than the official number of 2,049. Updated at 10.41pm BST 10.12pm BST Streamed films to be eligible for Oscars Films released on streaming platforms only will be eligible for Academy Awards next year because of the pandemic’s disruption to the industry, the organisers of the Oscars have said. The change, announced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, follows the closure of cinemas across the US. Previously, a movie had to have been screened in a cinema in Los Angeles for at least seven days to be eligible for Oscar consideration. 9.58pm BST The number of cases in Peru has passed 30,000, with 854 associated deaths, the country’s health ministry has confirmed. Tuesday’s 31,190 confirmed cases represents the second-highest caseload in Latin America. The number has more than doubled in nine days, according to a Reuters tally. Infections have prompted the collapse of some medical facilities, with bodies being kept in hallways, masks being repeatedly reused, and protests breaking out amongst medical workers concerned over their safety. 9.55pm BST In the UK, leading BAME campaigners have said the credibility of an inquiry into why black, Asian and minority ethnic people are being disproportionately affected by Covid-19 is being undermined among those it seeks to serve by the appointment of Trevor Phillips. The former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission was selected despite being suspended from the Labour party last month for alleged Islamophobia, including a reference to UK Muslims as being “a nation within a nation”. The first four UK doctors with Covid-19 known to have died were all Muslim. And Labour’s former shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, has said: We need a public inquiry. Very sadly, the public health executive have chosen to make Trevor Phillips one of their advisers on their inquiry, which I think means that their inquiry is dead on arrival. Related: Trevor Phillips role ‘undermines Covid-19 BAME inquiry’ 9.16pm BST Morocco has insisted that allegations of police brutality in enforcing the lockdown there are unfounded after an official in the office of the UN high commissioner for human eights included it in a list of countries where crackdowns have raised concern. High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet has accused some governments of using emergency powers invoked over the coronavirus “to quash dissent, control the population, and even perpetuate their time in power”. Bachelet did not name any countries. But at a news conference in Geneva, Georgette Gagnon, the director of field operations for the UN high commissioner’s office, included Morocco among 15 countries where police actions in enforcing lockdown measures were deemed most troubling. Morocco’s diplomatic mission in Geneva said measures it has adopted are in line with “the rule of law in full respect of human rights”. False information on alleged violations shared by some media are unfounded and were not mentioned in any official document of the High Commission for Human Rights. Moroccan police have registered nearly 77,000 violations of lockdown measures and nearly 41,000 people are awaiting trial, a Moroccan source told Reuters. Prosecutors said 5% of them are in detention. Morocco has confirmed 4,252 cases of the coronavirus, including 165 deaths. 9.05pm BST The US vice-president Mike Pence has been heavily criticised for failing to wear a face mask on a visit to the Mayo Clinic’s facilities in Minnesota. Pence leads the US government’s coronavirus taskforce, though he is typically overshadowed by Donald Trump or medical experts at the regular press briefings. Related: Mike Pence ignores Mayo Clinic's face mask rule during visit Updated at 9.07pm BST 9.02pm BST Nearly 70 residents of a single home for military veterans in the US state of Massachusetts have died, local officials have said. While the death toll at the state-run Holyoke Soldiers’ Home continues to climb, federal officials are investigating whether residents were denied proper medical care while the state’s top prosecutor is deciding whether to bring legal action. “It’s horrific. These guys never had a chance,” said Edward Lapointe, whose father-in-law lives at the home and had a mild case of the virus. According to the Associated Press, officials said 66 residents who tested positive and the cause of another death is unknown. Another 83 residents and 81 staff have tested positive. 8.20pm BST A state of emergency in the Czech Republic is set to be extended until 17 May after a vote in the lower house of the country’s parliament. The extension is a week shorter than the government sought. The prime minister, Andrej Babiš, had asked for an extension until 25 May to be able to keep restrictions on business in place. The state of emergency was due to expire on 30 April. The government is reluctant to end the emergency early, even though it has already reopened some shops and services over the past week as the pace of new infections has declined. It has announced that it now expects to reopen the economy faster than previously forecast, although not in time for the deadline now set by parliament. Updated at 8.29pm BST 8.16pm BST Ireland has failed to reach its target to carry out 100,000 tests per week and will not meet it until the week of 18 May, three weeks later than planned, a senior health official has admitted. The ability to quickly test and isolate anyone who catches the virus is a key component in the debate over whether to ease stay-home restrictions now in place until 5 May. Ireland’s chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, set the 100,000 testing capacity target on 17 April and said the health service planned to meet it within 10 days. But Cillian De Gascun, chair of Ireland’s expert advisory group, has said testing capacity has been increased to only 60,000 tests per week. 8.10pm BST The teenage son of a doctor who died of Covid-19 after warning the UK prime minister Boris Johnson about a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) is still holding out for an apology from the government after personally confronting the health secretary, Matt Hancock. In one of the most symbolic moments yet of the crisis, 18-year-old Intisar Chowdhury picked up the baton from his father Dr Abdul Mabud Chowdhury and asked the health secretary on radio if he regretted not taking more seriously the concerns he had raised in a letter to Downing Street two weeks before his death. Dr Abdul Mahud Chowhury, on a flight to Bangladesh to see the hospital he established Photograph: Intisar Chowhury The teen’s intervention led to figures from politics and beyond heaping pressure on the government to admit that it had made serious errors in relation to PPE for key workers who have died. They were commemorated on Tuesday in a one-minute silence. After challenging Hancock on LBC radio, Chowdhury told the Guardian: I have faith there will be an apology because I do feel that it has come to a point where we need one. The government are not robots. They are humans and they will understand that. The health secretary would only go so far as to say he was really sorry about his father’s death. I feel that was a blanket statement, that other senior government figures have forbid an apology and that was why Matt Hancock, Priti Patel and others have not given a real apology. Whoever instructed that blanket statement – and I’m not sure who it was – was in the wrong because apologies are not an admission of guilt. Apologies are not going to make you liable for litigation and things like that. The purpose of them is to display honesty, integrity and build trust from the public. That is the most important aspect. Dr Chowdhury, a consultant urologist at Homerton hospital in east London, urged the prime minister to ensure every NHS worker was protected in an open letter last month shortly after being taken ill with Covid-19.

But they will need to wear face masks when travelling in taxis or on public transport, and will not immediately be able to travel around the country. Schools and churches will open in May and hotels, restaurants and tavernas on 1 June. But they too will have to apply austere physical distancing rules when they do. Mitsotakis said: All these things should become second nature, because there is no return to pre-coronavirus reality. Already, we are living differently. The relaxation of measures will be reviewed every 24 hours by the experts who have been advising the government, raising the spectre of the policies being reintroduced if necessary. Updated at 8.03pm BST 7.21pm BST The Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has announced the relaxation of restrictions enforced almost six weeks ago. In a televised speech from his Megarou Maximou office, Mitsotakis said the containment measures will be reversed, gradually, beginning on Monday 4 May. “Our new slogan will be we stay safe,” he said, insisting that exit from lockdown would unfold according to a finely tuned plan over the course of the next two months. The centre-right government implemented draconian safeguards early on and Greece has had far fewer deaths and infections than most EU member states; suffering 138 and 2,566 respectively. Mitsotakis said: Today, we can say with certainty that the measures we took paid off. The facts cannot be disputed. He said new cases have been virtually eliminated and the number of patients requiring hospitalisation has dropped; as has the number in intensive care. But the Greek leader warned the battle is now on to keep it that way. This is not the end of the ordeal but a continuation. I will say it again: our exit from quarantine will be done step by step. No one can rule out a possible resurgence of the threat. Updated at 7.25pm BST 7.15pm BST The shadow transport secretary, Labour’s Jim McMahon, has said the news is devastating for BA staff. The government should have stepped in sooner and done more to protect their jobs. The aviation industry is critical to the UK economy but workers should not be being laid off by those at the top who have reaped the rewards from their hard work. It was always clear aviation needed a sector specific deal to alleviate the immediate financial pressures that exist, yet the government failed to act. The government must do more to ensure that airlines and airports have the financial resources needed to operate in a safe environment for staff and customers when the time is right to transition out of the lockdown. 7.13pm BST More than one in four BA staff facing redundancy British Airways has set out plans to make as many as 12,000 of its staff redundant due to the global collapse in air travel caused by the pandemic. The airline’s chief executive, Alex Cruz, has told BA’s 42,000 staff that the company “must act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future” and that more than one in four jobs must be cut. Cruz said BA, which has placed 22,600 people on the UK government’s furlough scheme, “cannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely”. Yesterday, British Airways flew just a handful of aircraft out of Heathrow. On a normal day, we would fly more than 300. What we are facing as an airline, like so many other businesses up and down the country, is that there is no ‘normal’ any longer. Related: British Airways plans to make up to 12,000 staff redundant 7.02pm BST Summary Here are the latest lines in the Guardian’s global coverage of the coronavirus outbreak: The head of Germany’s Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases called on people to stay at home as much as possible as new figures show the country’s infection rate has increased. Vladimir Putin extended a non-working period in Russia until 11 May, as he warned the rate of infection in the country has not yet peaked. The Russian president made the announcement during a meeting with senior officials and regional heads. France began outlining the schedule for the end of the lockdown. The prime minister, Édouard Philippe said: “Who could have envisaged a France where schools, universities, cafes, restaurants, the majority of businesses, libraries … beaches, stadiums … would be closed?” Philippe also announced an ambition to increase testing to 700,000 a week, including everyone who has been in contact with someone with the virus, whether they are symptomatic or not. The number of confirmed cases in Saudia Arabia passed 20,000 as its health authorities reported 1,266 new infections. The kingdom reported eight deaths, bringing its total death toll to 152. The UK said it would begin including deaths in care homes in its daily reports, as official figures show they account for almost a quarter of the total death toll in England and Wales, with yet more occurring in private homes, hospices or elsewhere. Britain also expanded the list of those eligible for coronavirus tests, with health secretary Matt Hancock saying asymptomatic NHS and care staff, over-65s and those who travel to work will now qualify. He previously promised there would be 100,000 tests per day by the end of April. More than 3 million people around the world have been infected with coronavirus, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, while 212,345 are confirmed to have died. But the figures are likely to represent significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting. 6.49pm BST Harley-Davidson has reported a 45% drop in quarterly profits, as motorcycle sales are hit by the global coronavirus pandemic. The US manufacturer said Covid-19 had “dramatically changed” its business environment and it would need to make widespread cost cuts. Net income fell to $70m (£56m) in the first three months of the year, from $128m in the same period last year. The Milwaukee-based company said global sales in the first quarter fell 18% to 40,439 motorcycles. Jochen Zeitz, acting president and chief executive of Harley-Davidson, said: Covid-19 has dramatically changed our business environment and it is critical we respond with agility to this new reality. We have determined that we need to make significant changes to the company: to our priorities, to our operating model and to our strategy to drive more consistent performance as we emerge from this crisis. Updated at 6.51pm BST 6.35pm BST Portugal to end state of emergency on Saturday The president of Portugal has announced the country’s state of emergency to tackle the coronavirus pandemic will end at the weekend, AFP reports. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said the third 15-day period of the state of emergency will end at midnight on Saturday and “we hope it will not be necessary to use it again in the future,” the president told the media. But, he warned, a return to normal activity would proceed “in stages”. Sunday will also be a lockdown day, meaning that only essential workers will be able to leave their residence during the coming long weekend, which begins on 1 May.

Next Tuesday, Costa is due to meet the president of the Portuguese Football Federation and the leaders of the country’s three biggest clubs - Benfica, Porto and Sporting Lisbon - to discuss a possible resumption of the league from the start of June at the earliest. It comes as Portugal reported 295 new confirmed cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number in the country to 24,322. There have been 948 deaths from Covid-19, after 20 more were announced on Tuesday. Updated at 6.40pm BST 6.27pm BST People in Germany have been advised to stay at home as much as possible and continue to apply physical distancing as official data appeared to indicate the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic was once again accelerating, reports Philip Oltermann, the Guardian’s Berlin bureau chief. The basic reproduction number (R), indicating how many new cases one infected person generates on average, has come to be seen as the key indicator over whether restrictions on public life can be loosened after Angela Merkel stressed the importance of keeping the number below one. On Tuesday, the German government’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), announced the reproduction number for Monday 27 April had risen to 1, after having put it as low as 0.7 in mid-April. Lothar Wieler, the RKI’s president, later specified that the reproduction rate for Monday was 0.96, and therefore technically still below one. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel – seen here speaking during an international climate video conference on Tuesday – has stressed the importance of keeping the Covid-19 reproduction rate below one. Photograph: Michael Kappeler/EPA Scientists believe the basic reproduction rate of Covid-19, R0, to lie somewhere between 2.4 and 3.3. Without measures taken to curb the spread of the virus, the rate of new infections would grow exponentially, until about 70% of the population has been infected. Wieler appealed to the German public to “preserve our success” of having prevented health services from being overwhelmed, by continuing to apply physical distancing even though federal authorities have already begun to relax restrictions on social movement. Related: Germans urged to stay home amid fears Covid-19 infection rate is rising again Updated at 6.29pm BST 6.23pm BST Justin Trudeau has urged caution as Canada’s most populous provinces announce plans to ease their lockdown measures, highlighting the challenge of balancing public health recommendations with a growing pressure to loosen coronavirus restrictions, writes Leyland Cecco in Toronto. Trudeau said on Tuesday: The measures we’ve taken so far are working. In fact, in many parts of the country the curve has flattened. But we’re not out of the woods yet. We’re in the middle of the most serious public health emergency Canada has ever seen and if we lift measures too quickly, we might lose the progress we’ve made. Quebec – the hardest-hit region in the country with more than 1,600 deaths – plans to reopen elementary schools and childcare facilities on 11 May. The province has opted to suspend the return of high school until autumn, fearing that 1 million students descending on schools could trigger a second wave of Covid-19 cases. But officials have acknowledged growing concerns the sustained lockdown could have on younger children. “Life must go on,” said the premier, François Legault, adding that parents would not be required to send their children to school and that older teachers with health concerns would be permitted to work from home. On Tuesday afternoon, Quebec is set to announce plans for businesses to reopen. Ontario, in contrast, has taken a far more cautious approach, announcing what the premier, Doug Ford, called a “road map” rather than “calendar” on Monday. “The framework is about how we’re reopening – not when we’re reopening,” said Ford.

Prisoners lit fires and broke out of confinement in their wings into communal areas in the Miguel Castro Castro prison early on Monday afternoon, reports Dan Collyns from Lima. Television images showed prisoners holding up banners and signs which read: “We want to live but outside these walls” and “Right to life”, demanding their release. Others showed inmates on the rooftops of the jail clashing with police officers who responded with teargas and firearms. By the evening, some 200 police officers and 70 soldiers had quelled the riot but questions are being asked about the proportionate use of force after initial reports of three dead prisoners rose to nine. Five police and 60 prison officers were injured in the incident, the authorities said.

Local media reports claim the violence flared after the body was left in a communal area of the prison, but the head of Peru’s prison service Gerson Villar denies this. Villar told local media that the prison service was investigating the deaths. “[The officers] did not use firearms, they used buckshot shotguns,” he said, insisting that officers were issued with “non-lethal arms”. Some 631 prisoners were found to be infected with coronavirus after 1,393 rapid tests were conducted in Peru’s jails, Villar added.

Covid-19 has impacted hard on its prison population of around 97,500. At least 500 inmates were infected with the virus and 13 were reported to have died along with five prison officers, the authorities reported last week. Some human rights groups are calling on the Peruvian government to allow house arrest during the pandemic. Around 3,000 vulnerable inmates were to set be released amid fears about Covid-19 propagation in the country’s jails, the justice ministry announced last week. Peru has confirmed 28,699 cases of coronavirus and 782 deaths, the second-highest total in Latin America after Brazil. Updated at 6.25pm BST 6.08pm BST Spain outlines \"plan for transition to normality\" The government in Spain on Tuesday announced details of its lockdown strategy, as the country’s daily death toll continued to decline and the rate of contagion fell, Stephen Burgen reports from Barcelona. With 301 deaths recorded over the past 24 hours, compared to 331 yesterday, the number of dead now stands at 23,822 out of a total of 210,000 reported cases. The “plan for a transition to normality” outlined by Pedro Sánchez, the prime minister, proposes a transition in four phases, each lasting approximately two weeks, without setting a specific date when bars and restaurants can reopen or sporting and other events can resume. It divides the transition into areas of activities including work, personal life, culture, sport, tourism and religion, each of which will be assessed in accordance with progress in the battle against the virus. The easing of the strict lockdown began last Sunday when for the first time in seven weeks children under 12 were allowed out with their parents. This Saturday adults will be allowed out for exercise.

The majority of cases have been concentrated in cities, Madrid and Barcelona in particular, and restrictions will be loosened sooner in some rural areas and the Canary and Balearic Islands where the pandemic seems to be more under control. Initially some bars and restaurants with outside terraces will be allowed to open 30% of their outdoor tables and hotels will also be permitted to offer 30% of their rooms. Small businesses will be allowed to open under rules of social distancing, but not shopping centres. Cinemas and theatres will reopen, but only at 30% capacity. This will be relaxed gradually towards the end of the year. Freedom of movement will gradually be extended and should return to normal by the end of June, although it’s recommended that people continue to wear masks. Schools will reopen in September. The ministry of health will coordinate the de-escalation of the lockdown which means that normality will return at different speeds in different zones, Sánchez said. Each area will have to meet certain criteria before advancing to the next phase. “It depends on all of us,” Sánchez said. “Any irresponsible behaviour will harm society overall. We have to curb our impatience and allow ourselves to be guided by the experts. Our behaviour can save lives and this is what patriotism means right now.” Updated at 6.14pm BST 5.55pm BST UK reports 586 more deaths from Covid-19 The UK has recorded 586 new deaths from Covid-19, according to the country’s health secretary, Matt Hancock, bringing the total death toll in British hospitals to 21,678. In the UK government’s daily coronavirus briefing, Hancock said that the government will publish daily figures for the number of coronavirus deaths in care homes and in the community. It comes after consistent criticism of the UK’s reporting of Covid-19 deaths, with the government producing daily figures showing just the numbers of deaths in hospitals then comparing them with daily death toll figures from other countries that include deaths in other settings. Hancock said the proportion of coronavirus deaths in care homes is around a sixth of the total, a figure that did not seem in line with the most recent reports from the UK’s Office for National Statistics, which suggested that about 70% were in hospitals, while the rest were in private homes, hospices, or elsewhere.

Some experts have warned that the recent anti-quarantine rallies and counter-protests taking place nationwide could cause a surge in coronavirus cases in America. Guardian US writer Adam Gabbatt explains where these protests originated and who is behind them 5.28pm BST Governments planning to ease coronavirus lockdown restrictions must take action to prevent and control the spread of Covid-19 in workplaces, the International Labour Organisation said on Tuesday. In a statement marking international safety and health at work day, the ILO said authorities needed to seek active involvement from and dialogue with employers and workers to ensure people’s safety at work. Guy Ryder, director general of the ILO, said: The safety and health of our entire workforce is paramount today. In the face of an infectious disease outbreak, how we protect our workers now clearly dictates how safe our communities are, and how resilient our businesses will be, as this pandemic evolves. It is only by implementing occupational safety and health measures that we can protect the lives of workers, their families and the larger communities, ensure work continuity and economic survival. The ILO called for risk control measures to be specifically adapted to the needs of workers on the frontlines of the Covid-19 pandemic, including health workers, nurses, doctors and emergency workers, as well as those in food retail and cleaning services. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, said: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for strong national programmes to protect the health and safety of health workers, medical professionals, emergency responders, and the many other workers risking their lives on our behalf. On World Day for Safety and Health at Work, I call on all countries to assure well-defined, decent and safe working conditions for all health workers.

The French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, told parliament the decision to confine the population to their homes six weeks ago had saved 62,000 lives but it was now time to start lifting the lockdown to avoid economic collapse. He said: We are going to have to learn to live with Covid-19, and to protect ourselves from it … It is a fine line that must be followed. A little too much carelessness, and the epidemic restarts. A little too much caution, and the entire country sinks. Edouard Philippe, France’s prime minister, delivers his speech at the National Assembly in Paris Photograph: David Niviere/AFP via Getty Images France has so far suffered more than 23,000 deaths from the coronavirus, one of the world’s highest death tolls. Philippe warned that since some parts of the country had been hit far harder than others, lockdown measures would be lifted by area, with départements classified as red, orange or green depending on their infection level. And if infection rates did not continue to fall as expected over the coming fortnight, the prime minister said, “we will not unwind the lockdown on May 11 – or we will do it more strictly” Governments across Europe are wrestling with the conundrum of how best to lift confinement measures that are exacting a disastrous toll on their economies while avoiding a dangerous second wave of contagion, with Spain also set to announce its exit plan on Tuesday.

Italy has recorded 201,505 coronavirus cases to date, including the victims and 68,941 survivors. 5.06pm BST The World Health Organization warned Tuesday of the impact coronavirus could have in Middle Eastern conflict zones, AFP reports. “This fight has become even more challenging with the appearance of the virus in countries such as the Syrian Arabic Republic, Libya and Yemen,” said the WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean director Ahmed al-Mandhari. Years of turmoil and conflicts have destroyed healthcare infrastructure in these countries, leaving vulnerable populations prone to infectious diseases as they grapple with limited access to basic medical services, he told an online press conference from Cairo. شاهد الآن | مؤتمر صحفي لمنظمة الصحة العالمية حول آخر المستجدات المتعلقة بمرض #كوفيد_19. https://t.co/D2qeh68FGQ — WHO EMRO (@WHOEMRO) April 28, 2020 Another serious challenge in these countries is political fragmentation, which has often hindered information sharing and humanitarian access in these countries, Mandhari added. Yemen, where half of healthcare facilities have been destroyed in a war between local rebels and an international coalition led by Saudi Arabia, has so far declared a single Covid-19 case. Syria, which has experienced a devastating nine-year war, has declared 43 cases. And Libya, which has been gripped by chaos and fighting since the 2011 removal and killing of longtime leader Moamer Kadhafi, has reported 61 cases. \"Let this unprecedented #COVID19 pandemic be an opportunity for all nations to put aside their differences, find common ground, and work together for the sake of humanity.\" - Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari pic.twitter.com/f0rfcym6vw — WHO EMRO (@WHOEMRO) April 28, 2020 4.51pm BST Six more people have died from Covid-19 in Serbia, taking its death toll from the coronavirus to 168, the country’s health authorities reported on Tuesday, according to Serbian news site Telegraf. In the past 24 hours, a further 222 confirmed cases of coronavirus were detected, after 5,446 people were tested, making a total of 8,497 infections across Serbia since its outbreak began. Seventy-nine patients are being ventilated in Serbian hospitals. Serbia’s latest figures come as the country eases its lockdown. People in the country were from today allowed out to visit parks and exercise outdoors again, while from from next Monday, 4 May, coffee shops and restaurants will reopen, although social distancing and face masks will be mandatory. (“I don’t know how we can eat with masks on, but i will update you on that one,” Ivana Nikolić, Telegraf’s world news editor, tells me.) Nursery schools and primary schools for children up to the age of 12 will reopen from 11 May. On 18 May, air traffic will resume. Updated at 5.00pm BST 4.31pm BST Refugees face worse consequences from the long-term economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic than they do from the disease itself, the head of the Red Cross has said. In an address to the African Union’s peace and security council, Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross said the Covid-19 pandemic came “on top of an already devastating humanitarian situation” precipitated by conflicts, climate change and plagues of locusts. He warned that displaced people and refugees already have limited access to basic services, and face difficulties in maintaining basic hygiene and physical distancing measures. In his statement, published online on Tuesday, Maurer said: IDPs will also be disproportionately impacted by the economic repercussions of lockdown measures, given their already precarious circumstances and heavy dependency on external support from host communities and humanitarian actors. It is therefore the ICRC’s view that if Covid-19 containment measures are imposed, authorities need to prepare and/or allow for alternate methods of delivering assistance and providing services to IDPs and host communities, in conditions that protect the health of both IDPs and staff involved. He added: The long-term economic disruption (and resulting social disruption) will be far worse than the health/pandemic itself. We must therefore work very hard collectively and in solidarity to accelerate responses not just in economic terms but also safety nets and given that the economic and social disruption in fragile contexts will be most acute, the international community needs to support the response through dedicated resources to these contexts. Updated at 4.37pm BST 4.17pm BST Experts have warned that a surge in gun-related Google searches and estimated gun sales in the US during the worst public health emergency in modern history could lead to higher suicide rates, writes Alexandra Villarreal in New York. From early March to mid-April, when the US began to experience the full force of Covid-19, its residents conducted roughly 2.1m Google searches about buying and cleaning guns, according to research conducted by Everytown for Gun Safety and shared exclusively with the Guardian. Those numbers signaled a 158% increase from what would have been expected absent the coronavirus pandemic. Estimated gun sales also soared to 2.58m in March, Small Arms Analytics and Forecasting reported, an 85.3% jump from the same time last year. Sarah Burd-Sharps, director of research at Everytown, said: This unprecedented spike in new guns in people’s homes and this Googling about taking people’s guns out of storage, combined with this drastic increase in unemployment, presents a huge risk for a collateral public health crisis, which is firearm suicide.

Restrictions were due to be lifted at the end of April, but Putin said the peak of Russia’s coronavirus infections had not yet been reached. He ordered the government to come up with fresh measures aimed at supporting the economy and citizens, and to prepare recommendations on gradually easing the coronavirus lockdown restrictions by 5 May.

Speaking at a two-day international meeting on climate change, the United Nations chief said the only effective response to the worldwide health emergency is “brave, visionary and collaborative leadership”. “The same leadership is needed to address the looming existential threat of climate disruption,” Guterres said, noting that the past decade was the hottest in history since measurements began. #COVID19 has exposed the fragility of our societies to global shocks, such as disease or the climate crisis.

The picturesque fishing village of Zahara de los Atunes sent tractors equipped with sprayers along part of its beach last week as officials readied for the release of the country’s children after six weeks of confinement. Spain has been among the countries hardest hit by coronavirus, with more than 23,800 deaths. The government imposed lockdown measures in mid-March, and this week the measures were loosened to allow children under the age of 14 daily outings of up to an hour. The decision to disinfect the beach has incensed environmentalists. “It’s totally absurd,” said María Dolores Iglesias Benítez. “The beach is a living ecosystem. And when you spray it down with bleach, you’re killing everything you come across.” Related: Spanish official apologises for spraying beach with bleach 3.37pm BST With Europe and the US still the hotspots for the coronavirus pandemic, the response to the outbreak has so far focused primarily on its impact on the developed world, while poorer countries have to an extent been overlooked. An editorial in the medical journal the Lancet challenges this outlook. Headlined “Decolonising Covid-19”, it argues that even before the health impact of the pandemic has been felt in the developing world, it’s economic impact is proving hugely damaging. UNDP has estimated income losses of US$220 billion in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and that nearly half of all jobs in Africa could be lost. This, combined with the potential health impact, could be catastrophic. A Comment published in The Lancet Global Health in April found that a rapid acceleration in the number of cases in west Africa, as has been seen in Europe, could quickly overwhelm vulnerable health systems that typically have fewer than five hospital beds per 10,000 population. There is a risk, the Lancet says, that attempts to tackle the pandemic by richer nations could leave the developing world “in the dark”, whilst, at the same time, expertise developed in Africa from dealing with, for example, the Ebola epidemics, is not being respected. And, it adds, “a sinister undercurrent has re-emerged” as teams around the world race to develop treatments and vaccines for Covid-19. At the beginning of April, two French doctors sparked an intense backlash over comments made during a live television discussion about Covid-19 trials in Europe and Australia by saying that the studies should be done in Africa first “where there are no masks, no treatments, no resuscitation”, reasoning that certain studies on AIDS had been carried out in prostitutes “because we know that they are highly exposed and that they do not protect themselves”. Africa is a continent where the legacy of colonialism is particularly heavy. It is shocking to hear these remarks from scientists in the 21st century, at a time when the work of epidemiologists, infectious disease modellers, public health specialists and, indeed, all health workers, is in the public spotlight like never before. At the WHO press briefing on April 6, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus responded plainly, “To be honest, I was so appalled, and it was at a time when I said we needed solidarity. These kinds of racist remarks will not help. It goes against solidarity. Africa cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine … The hangover from a colonial mentality has to stop.” Read the rest of the article here.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently said surgical masks are “an acceptable alternative” to highly protective N95 respirators unless workers are performing intubations or other procedures on patients with Covid-19 that could unleash high volumes of virus particles. But scholars, not-for-profit leaders and former regulators in the specialized field of occupational safety say relying on surgical masks – which are considerably less protective than N95 respirators – is almost certainly fueling illness among frontline health workers, who probably make up about 11% of all known Covid-19 cases.

He announced that nurseries and primary schools will reopen on 12 May, with no more than 10 children in a nursery group and 15 per school class. A limited reopening of secondary schools will begin on 18 May. Updated at 3.46pm BST 2.45pm BST South Africa and Nigeria - the two biggest economies in sub-Saharan Africa - will ease their lockdowns over the next days despite the continuing spread of Covid-19 on the continent. There are now around 32,000 confirmed cases of the virus and 1,400 deaths reported in Africa, though limited testing means this is likely to be a significant underestimate. But the social and economic pain inflicted by lockdowns, especially in poor, crowded neighbourhoods, is severe, and there have been growing if sporadic protests in many countries. More than 25 million residents in Abuja, Lagos and neighbouring Ogun state have been under a federal lockdown in Nigeria since 30 March. This will now be eased and new measures introduced. These include a nationwide night-time curfew, mandatory wearing of facemasks and a ban on “non-essential” travel between different regions. But a new and immediate two-week lockdown will be imposed in northern Nigeria’s largest city Kano after officials said they were probing reports of “mysterious deaths” that doctors say often involve pneumonia. In South Africa, where a strict nationwide lockdown has confined 56 million people to their homes for all but essential journeys since late March, restrictions are being loosened on Friday to allow some people to go back to work in designated industries and basic public transport to function. Schools however remain shut and sales of alcohol banned. South Africa has been lauded for its aggressive effort to root out pockets of infection with screening and testing, as well as its big economic relief package. However there are signs that the lockdown - which has been largely respected - is beginning to fray. In a national address last week, Cyril Ramaphosa described five stages of progressively looser lockdown. But no dates have been given for moving down (or up) the scale beyond May 1st and the shift to phase four, and different phases can be imposed in different parts of the country simultaneously. Strategies have differed across Africa. Kenya has imposed a loose lockdown in the capital Nairobi and port city of Mombasa along with a nationwide curfew. Ghana recently lifted most of the restrictions placed on inhabitants of major cities but has maintained a ban on social events and public gatherings are still banned. So too has the Democratic Republic of Congo, which imposed a loose lockdown on parts of the capital Kinshasa. In Malawi, legal action has blocked attempts by the government to impose a lockdown while in Tanzania, president John Magufuli has been criticised for not imposing one fast enough. Updated at 2.57pm BST 2.41pm BST Philippe also said there was a risk of France’s economy collapsing if the lockdown was not ended, and that the country’s hospitals had held up well to the challenge posed by the virus. “The risk of a second wave, which might mean another lockdown, is a risk we have to take seriously,” he said, adding France had to “protect, test and isolate”. The lockdown would be followed by a monitoring phase, which would continue until 2 June, with regulations differing between regions. “Our national strategy has to be adapted to different circumstances,” Philippe said, adding that he would be meeting local officials on Wednesday and unions on Thursday to discuss the end of lockdown measures. “So, we have to live with virus, to end the lockdown progressively and adapt to circumstances; these are the three elements of our strategy,” he said. Philippe said the availability of masks had been a subject that angered and upset a lot of French people. “Giving masks to medical workers, necessarily meant depriving others of them,” he said. He said local authorities that bought masks would be reimbursed by the government for half the price, and that there would be enough masks in the country for the general public by 11 May, the day the lockdown ends, but said it would be some time for masks to be freely and widely available in shops. Updated at 2.43pm BST 2.33pm BST French prime minister outlines schedule for end of lockdown The French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, has begun outlining the schedule for the end of the coronavirus lockdown in France to MPs in the Assemblée Nationale. Philippe began saying the situation was unique. “Who could have envisaged a France where schools, universities, cafés, restaurants, the majority of businesses, libraries … beaches, stadia … would be closed. We have never known this situation in our country. Not during the war, not during the occupation, not during previous epidemics,” he said. “The country cannot be locked down for a long time … it is efficient against the virus, to stop its spread and the saturation of our hospitals and protect vulnerable people.” “An instrument is only useful if in the long term the positive effects are greater than the negative … We have to proceed to a progressive end of lockdown.” Philippe said he would outline the “national strategy” to end the lockdown. In medical terms “we have to learn to live with the virus …no vaccine will be available in the short term, there is no treatment and we don’t have what they call herd immunity”. Philippe said it was implausible to think the virus would just “disappear of it’s own accord”. He also announced that there will be no League 1 or 2 football matches before August. Updated at 2.45pm BST 2.26pm BST New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has said he wishes he had “blown the bugle” about Covid-19 earlier.

Countries such as France, Italy and Spain have recorded more deaths but not by much, and New York City alone has the fifth-highest death total in the world, with the UK in fourth. Speaking to Axios on HBO, Cuomo discussed US reactions to the first news of the outbreak, from China in December. “When we heard in December that China had a virus problem,” he said, “and China said basically, ‘It was under control, don’t worry,’ we should’ve worried. “I wish someone stood up and blew the bugle. And if no one was going to blow the bugle, I would feel much better if I was a bugle blower last December and January … I would feel better sitting here today saying, ‘I blew the bugle about Wuhan province in January.’ I can’t say that.” More here: Related: Andrew Cuomo wishes he 'blew the bugle' on coronavirus earlier Updated at 2.33pm BST 2.18pm BST Reuters have posted on Twitter footage of Belgian families visiting care home residents from the relative safety of a window-cleaning crane: In Brussels, families visited care home residents for the first time in weeks on a raised platform crane, which is normally used for cleaning windows pic.twitter.com/hibileVAGW — Reuters (@Reuters) April 28, 2020 2.07pm BST The Los Angeles Lakers have repaid a loan of roughly $4.6m from coronavirus business relief funds after learning the program had been depleted.

The Baltic state, which has recorded 1,344 cases of the coronavirus and 44 deaths, allowed cafes and restaurants with outdoor seating, hairdressers and almost all shops to begin reopening this week as part of a staged exit from lockdown. But the health ministry has imposed strict physical distancing rules and safety measures. Shops must limit the number of customers at one time, masks will remain mandatory in all public spaces, and cafe and restaurant tables have to be placed at least 2 metres apart.

A further 171 people tested positive for coronavirus, according to the the latest update from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), fewer than any single day since 15 March. 1.03pm BST The economic crisis precipitated by the lockdowns to curb the spread of the coronavirus is beginning to bite across the world. In few places is that more apparent than Spain, where figures show the unemployment rate jumped to 14.4% in the first quarter of 2020. The jobless rate was up from 13.8% in the previous quarter, its lowest level since the third quarter of 2008 but still the highest rate in the eurozone after Greece, AFP reports. “This rise reflects the effect of Covid-19,” secretary of state for the economy, Ana de la Cueva, told a news conference, adding the rise in joblessness was concentrated in the services sector and among workers with temporary contracts. Spain has been under lockdown since 14 March. The number of jobless rose by 121,000 people to hit 3.31 million at the end of March, according to the statistics office. But the figure may actually be higher since INE said many workers who lost their jobs were classified as “inactive” because the survey carried out to determine the jobless rate was disrupted by the lockdown. The jobless rate also does not include the roughly 3.9 million workers who the government says have been temporarily laid off from their jobs. Updated at 1.06pm BST 12.53pm BST How big-money measures are helping the economy through coronavirus – video explainer The global economy is heading for what the International Monetary Fund believes is the worst recession since at least the Great Depression after the Wall Street crash of 1929. This is as a consequence of governments around the world attempting to suppress economic and social activity through lockdown measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The Guardian’s economics correspondent, Richard Partington, explains the unprecedented measures being taken to help protect individuals, households and businesses; how they are helping and the costs they may involve. Updated at 1.07pm BST 12.42pm BST Police in Ireland have launched a week-long sweep of patrols and checkpoints to deter people from travelling before and during the May bank holiday, writes Rory Carroll, the Guardian’s Dublin correspondent. More than 2,500 gardaí started deploying on Tuesday to enforce restrictions on movement amid growing public restlessness with the lockdown. A gardaí police officer mans a checkpoint Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty Images Operation Fanacht will see patrols and checkpoints along main routes and back roads as well as at tourist locations and beauty spots until 4 May. It is a repeat of the operation that helped keep Ireland locked down during the Easter holiday, said John Twomey, the deputy commissioner. We need this compliance to continue. This is a critical week for the country. If we all work together, we can help save the lives of our family, friends, neighbours and colleagues. Government officials have expressed concern that compliance is fraying in anticipation of restrictions easing next week. Ireland’s infection rate has subsided but delays in testing and contact tracing may push back significant relaxation of the lockdown to late May. 12.29pm BST Luxembourg has announced an ambitious plan to test its entire population for coronavirus in a month, L’Essential reports. The government of the small, landlocked European country says it will begin the testing programme from 19 May. Claude Meisch, the research minister, said 20,000 tests can be performed every day across 17 stations in the country. Luxembourg has a population of about 600,000 people. It has so far detected 3,729 cases of coronavirus, of whom 88 patients have died and 3,123 have recovered. Updated at 12.33pm BST 12.08pm BST Summary These are the latest headlines in our global coronavirus news coverage. Austria has announced it will lift its lockdown at the end of April. The country will allow gatherings of up to 10 people, but the health minister, Rudolf Anschober, emphasised the importance of people continuing to follow distancing rules. The German economy is expected to contract 6.6% in 2020 due to coronavirus. According to economic institute Ifo, Europe’s largest economy shrank by 1.9% in the first three months of 2020 and is expecting a 12.2% contraction in the second quarter. The Covid-19 death toll in England and Wales was 52.9% higher than the daily figures. The Office for National Statistics said it had recorded 21,284 fatalities that mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate as of 17 April, compared with 13,917 in the daily hospital death stats published by the government. British energy firm BP recorded a $4.4bn net loss in the first quarter. As the coronavirus pandemic crushes demand for oil, the company’s profits plunged, down from a profit after tax of $2.9bn in the first quarter of 2019. Turkey has sent a planeload of medical equipment to help the US. It has sent hundreds of thousands of masks, along with overalls, disinfectant and goggles to help the US as it grapples with the coronavirus outbreak. Spain’s coronavirus death toll rises to 23,822 but the downward trend continues. There were 301 deaths recorded over the past 24 hours, compared with 331 yesterday and 288 on Monday. The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, will today outline Spain’s lockdown exit plan. Some children in the UK have died from a rare inflammatory syndrome that could be linked to Covid-19. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said some children without underlying health conditions had died. Italian and British medical experts are investigating a possible link between the coronavirus pandemic and clusters of severe inflammatory disease among infants who are arriving in hospital with high fevers and swollen arteries. The Egyptian president ordered the renewal for three months of a long-running state of emergency, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi cited health as well as security concerns for the extension of the state of emergency, which gives police broad powers of arrest and detention, and curtails constitutional rights such as freedom of speech and assembly. Diplomatic tensions escalated between Australia and China. Australia’s trade minister, Simon Birmingham, called for the Chinese ambassador to explain what Australia called a threat of “economic coercion” in response to Canberra’s push for an international inquiry into the source and spread of the coronavirus. The Scandinavian airline, SAS, said it could reduce its workforce by up to 5,000 full-time positions. It said the move was due to plunging demand and travel restrictions during the coronavirus outbreak. Updated at 12.34pm BST 12.00pm BST Germany infection rate rises to 1.0 as people told to stay home as much as possible The head of Germany’s Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases has called on Germans to stay at home as much as possible after new figures showed the coronavirus infection rate had increased. Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute, said the virus reproduction rate, dubbed ‘R’, is now at 1.0 in Germany, which means one person with the virus infects one other on average. Earlier this month, the rate was at 0.7. It comes after Germany eased some of its lockdown restrictions last week, allowing retailers with floor space of up to 800 sq metres to reopen, along with car and bicycle dealers, and bookshops. Lothar Wieler, president of Robert Koch Institute, speaking at Germany’s daily Covid-19 press briefing. Photograph: Action Press/REX/Shutterstock According to Reuters, Wieler told a regular news conference: Against the background of the easing (of restrictions), let’s ensure we can continue to defend this success we have achieved together. We don’t want the number of cases to rise again. Let’s, insofar as is possible, stay at home, let’s stick to the reduced contact. Academics have suggested public life may gradually return to normal if certain conditions are met, including the ‘R’ rate, stabilising at a low level. The number should stay below one, that is the big goal. The further it is below one, the more secure we can feel, the more leeway we have, but there are other numbers that are also important. The drop in new infections means that officials are now able to carry out contact-tracing again – something that had been abandoned in March when cases were rising too quickly, AFP reported. By contrast, the mortality rate from the disease has been rising day by day. On Tuesday, it had reached 3.8%, according to RKI figures, which remains well below some neighbouring countries such as France. Updated at 12.35pm BST 11.47am BST The United Arab Emirates recorded 541 new coronavirus infections on Tuesday, and seven deaths, as it pushed forward with plans to end its lockdown. Akhtar Mohammad Makoii, who writes for the Guardian from Afghanistan, is using his Twitter feed to post daily reports of the latest coronavirus statistics from across the Middle East. He reports that total infections in the country have now reached 11,380, the death toll now stands at 89. #coronavirus in United Arab Emirates Total infections: 11,380 New infections: 541 Apr27: 490 Apr26: 536 Apr25: 532 Apr24: 525 Apr23: 518 Apr22: 483 Apr21: 490 Apr20: 484 death toll: 89 New deaths: 7 Apr27: 6 Apr26: 5 Apr25: 7 Apr24: 8 Apr23: 4 Apr22: 6 Apr21: 3 Apr20: 2 — Akhtar Mohammad Makoii (@akhtar_makoii) April 28, 2020 The high number of infections comes at least partly because the UAE has rolled out one of the world’s most comprehensive testing regimes. Authorities say more than 1 million tests have been administered a number expected to rise, the Associated Press reports. Like in Singapore, another small, wealthy nation that relies heavily on migrant labour, many detected cases are among UAE’s population of low-paid labourers. They are particularly vulnerable to infection as they can live with up to 10 people in a single room. A woman walks in Ibn Battuta mall in the Emirate of Dubai Photograph: Giuseppe Cacace/AFP via Getty Images The latest from UAE comes as the country is opening up its cavernous malls and restaurants in a gamble to stimulate its economy while still trying to fight off the pandemic. According to AP, that’s led to a new normal of temperature checks, social distancing monitors at supermarkets and marked-off empty seats on the city’s driverless Metro. But crowds already have come to the malls and others are leaving their homes after weeks of a lockdown, eager to party in a city known for its nightlife and increasing the risk of the virus spreading. 11.27am BST The death toll in Iran from the coronavirus pandemic rose by 71 in the past 24 hours to 5,877, health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said on state TV on Tuesday, according to Reuters. The total number of diagnosed cases in Iran, one of the Middle Eastern countries hit hardest by the virus, has reached 92,584, he said. Iran’s defence minister, Brig Gen Amir Hatami, hailed his country’s response to the outbreak on Tuesday, the Islamic Republic News Agency (Irna) reported. In a visit to a hospital in Tehran, the Iranian capital, he said the country’s medical staff had fought coronavirus “as if they were on the battlefield to combat enemies”, and said it taught the country about how to deal with future threats.

Italian and British medical experts are investigating a possible link between the coronavirus pandemic and clusters of severe inflammatory disease among infants who are arriving in hospital with high fevers and swollen arteries. Doctors in northern Italy, one of the world’s hardest-hit areas during the pandemic, have reported extraordinarily large numbers of children under nine years old with severe cases of what appears to be Kawasaki disease, more common in parts of Asia. Hancock told LBC Radio: There are some children who have died who didn’t have underlying health conditions. It’s a new disease that we think may be caused by coronavirus and the Covid-19 virus. We’re not 100% sure because some of the people who got it hadn’t tested positive, so we’re doing a lot of research now but it is something that we’re worried about. Children were until now thought to be much less susceptible than their parents or grandparents to the most deadly complications wrought by the novel coronavirus, though the mysterious inflammatory disease noticed in Britain, Spain and Italy may demand a reassessment. “It is rare, although it is very significant for those children who do get it, the number of cases is small,” Hancock, one of the ministers leading Britain’s Covid-19 response, said. He did not give an exact figure for the number of deaths. Kawasaki disease, whose cause is unknown, is associated with fever, skin rashes, swelling of glands, and in severe cases, inflammation of arteries of the heart. Updated at 11.17am BST 10.52am BST Turkey sends planeload of medical equipment to help US Turkey has dispatched a planeload of personal protective equipment to support the US as it grapples with the coronavirus outbreak. A Turkish military cargo carrying the medical equipment took off from an airbase near the capital, Ankara, on Tuesday, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. It was scheduled to land at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington later in the day. Parcels of medical equipment to be donated by Turkey to help the US fight coronavirus.

Turkey has sent similar medical equipment aid to a total of 55 countries including Britain, Italy and Spain in an apparent attempt to improve its global standing by positioning itself as a provider of humanitarian aid in times of crisis. Updated at 11.17am BST 10.40am BST The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday that it is stepping up shipments of diagnostic tests and protective equipment, with a new focus on Latin America where Covid-19 is spreading. Paul Molinaro, chief of WHO operations support and logistics, said global vaccine shipments were disrupted in April and if this continued into May there will be gaps in immunisations, as well as disruption in some food supply chains. Molinaro told a UN virtual news briefing in Geneva: We saw the international air transport system on which we are quite dependent for movement of cargo gradually shut down. So we are at the point now where we need to look for solutions to this. It was “always willing to take more offers” of commercial aircraft. Panama will serve as a hub for regional distribution of personal protective equipment and other supplies in Latin America, he said. Updated at 11.18am BST 10.32am BST The Kremlin said president Vladimir Putin would give a speech about the coronavirus situation in the country later on Tuesday. “President Putin has a big speech planned, but I am not going to announce anything, let’s wait until the meeting,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Updated at 10.32am BST 10.05am BST The Czech Republic has reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus cases in more than six weeks as it eases out of a lockdown imposed to curb the spread of infection. The number of cases rose by 41 on Monday, bringing the total to 7,449, with 223 deaths. The central European country with a population of 10.7 million has seen far fewer cases than its western European neighbours after taking quick action to close schools and most shops and require face masks in public.

Photograph: David W Černý/Reuters The daily increase in new cases has been below 100 since 22 April while businesses have put pressure on the government to lift some of its lockdown measures in place since mid-March. The government is planning a full-reopening of shops and restaurants by 25 May. Restrictions on gatherings have been loosened, with groups of up to 10 now permitted in public, up from a previous limit of two. Czechs are once more allowed to travel abroad but have to present a negative coronavirus test or quarantine when they return. The country’s car manufacturing sector is also starting back up, giving some relief to an economy set to contract sharply this year. Skoda Auto, a unit of Volkswagen and the country’s biggest exporter, returned to work on Monday after a more than five-week outage since major factories idled last month to fight the spread of the virus. Related: UK said to be studying Czech exit plan where shops now reopening Updated at 11.19am BST 9.58am BST The Covid-19 death toll in England and Wales was 52.9% higher than the daily figures for deaths in hospitals released by the government as of 17 April, according to official data that include deaths in the community. The Office for National Statistics said it had recorded 21,284 fatalities that mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate as of 17 April, compared with 13,917 in the daily hospital death stats published by the government. Updated at 10.21am BST 9.56am BST Spain’s coronavirus death toll has risen to 23,822 but the downward trend continues, with 301 deaths recorded over the past 24 hours, compared to 331 yesterday and 288 on Monday. A total of 210,000 cases have been reported since the pandemic began. The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, will today outline Spain’s lockdown exit plan which has been flagged as being “gradual and asymmetrical”. Salvador Illa, the health minister, has suggested that the easing of lockdown restrictions should be staggered, with different groups of people, such as families with children and the elderly, being allowed out in shifts at different times of day. As of last Sunday, children under 12 were allowed out if accompanied by their parents and from next Saturday people of all ages will be allowed out for exercise, following seven weeks of strict lockdown. Surveys that tracked millions of mobile phones show that the overwhelming majority of Spaniards have adhered to the lockdown, with up to 95% not straying from their neighbourhood. It found that 30 million people had not gone further than 500 metres from their home. After six weeks stuck at home, Spain’s children are being allowed out as the government eased one of the world’s toughest coronavirus lockdowns.

Anyone with a temperature higher than 37 degrees will not be allowed to travel. In the southern region of Andalucía, which includes the Costa del Sol and is heavily dependent on tourism, there are plans to reopen hotels in early June. Bars and restaurants will also reopen but restrictive measures will be in place to maintain social distancing. Meanwhile, the Barcelona restaurant association estimated that around a quarter of the city’s 8,300 bars and restaurants won’t survive the current crisis. The association is calling for a freeze on rents until the industry recovers. 9.51am BST The Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, on Tuesday ordered the renewal for three months of a long-running state of emergency, citing health as well as security concerns. Egypt has been under a state of emergency since April 2017, when twin church bombings claimed by an Islamic State group affiliate killed dozens of people. The extension comes as the government battles to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic in the Arab world’s most populous country. A presidential decree published in the official gazette overnight said: Given the serious health and security situation … the state of emergency has been declared across the country for three months starting Tuesday 28 April. The health ministry has so far recorded 4,782 Covid-19 cases in the population of 100 million. Of those, 337 people have died, while 1,236 have recovered. The state of emergency gives police broad powers of arrest and detention, and curtails constitutional rights such as freedom of speech and assembly. Last week, state media reported that parliament had approved amendments to the emergency law expanding the president’s powers to curb the virus’s spread. The amendments grant the president rights to close schools, suspend public sector work, restrict gatherings, quarantine inbound travellers and order private medical facilities to assist with general healthcare. Updated at 9.58am BST 9.48am BST Malaysian health authorities on Tuesday reported 31 new coronavirus cases, raising the cumulative total to 5,851. The health ministry also reported one new death, bringing total fatalities to 100. 9.46am BST Australia has asked the Chinese ambassador to explain what it called a threat of “economic coercion” in response to Canberra’s push for an international inquiry into the source and spread of the coronavirus. Trade minister Simon Birmingham said Australia was a “crucial supplier” to China for critical imports like iron ore, and Australia’s resources and energy helped power much of China’s manufacturing growth and construction. Australia’s recent call for an international investigation into the coronavirus pandemic has angered China, its largest trading partner. Cheng Jingye, Beijing’s ambassador to Australia, told a local newspaper on Monday that Chinese consumers could boycott Australian beef, wine, tourism and universities in response. Birmingham said on Tuesday that Cheng had been called by the secretary of the department of foreign affairs and trade to explain his comments. Speaking on ABC radio, Birmingham said: Australia is no more going to change our policy position on major public health issues because of economic coercion, or threats of economic coercion, than we would change our policy position in matters of national security. The Chinese embassy published a summary of the conversation on its website later on Tuesday, which said Cheng had “flatly rejected the concern expressed from the Australian side”. Cheng also said “the fact cannot be buried that the proposal is a political manoeuvre”, according to the statement, which added that Australia was “crying up wine and selling vinegar” when it said the proposed review would not target China. China accounts for 26% of Australia’s total trade, worth about A$235bn ($150bn) in 2018-19, and is the biggest single market for Australian exports such as coal, iron ore, wine, beef, tourism and education. Updated at 10.00am BST 9.30am BST In Afghanistan, the president has issued a decree to release thousands of prisoners in a bid to contain the spread of coronavirus in prisons The country’s total number of confirmed cases reached 1,828 amid a continued surge of transmission in Herat, Kabul and Kandahar. Following a decree issued by President Ashraf Ghani on Monday, 12,399 prisoners convicted for different crimes will be pardoned as per certain parameters, Rashid Totakhail, the head of prison affairs said. This is in addition to 10,000 already in the process of being released. “All of the released prisoners have been directed to stay quarantined at their homes for at least 14 days as a precautionary measure in the wake of the coronavirus,” Totakhail added. Wahidullah Mayar, a health ministry spokesman, said on Tuesday that 125 more patients tested positive for Covid-19 in last 24 hours, taking the total number of infections to 1,828.

Thousands of Afghan migrants poured back from Iran in February and March, and the total number of infections in the province now stands at 444. Mayar said on Monday the next two weeks are “very critical” and asked the nation to stay at home. But with streets crowded with people and vehicles, experts fear fighting with the virus will be challenging. The United Nations Mission in Afghanistan said on Monday that more than 533 civilians, including 152 children, were killed in the first quarter of 2020. The UN said the new figures “highlight the urgent need for all parties to the conflict to do more to protect civilians from harm, especially in view of the looming threat posed to all Afghans by Covid-19”. The Taliban had already rejected multiple offers to declare a ceasefire and intensified their attacks, as around 100 Afghan security forces and 34 civilians were killed over last week. Updated at 10.01am BST 9.17am BST Singapore’s health ministry has said it is not able to test all migrant workers in dormitories and has been isolating some symptomatic patients first, a method that a government health adviser said was causing a lag in the reporting of cases. The island nation of 5.7 million people has nearly 15,000 confirmed coronavirus infections, one of the highest totals in Asia, largely because of outbreaks in cramped dormitories housing more than 300,000 mostly South Asian workers. The ministry on Tuesday confirmed 528 more coronavirus infections, the smallest daily rise in almost two weeks. Dale Fisher, chair of Singapore’s National Infection Prevention and Control committee, told ChannelNews Asia that authorities had stopped testing some symptomatic patients in hard-hit dorms and that these infections were not being immediately reported in official tallies. “Due to the need to prioritise, we are not able to test all in the dormitories at one go,” the health ministry said in a statement late on Monday following Fisher’s comments. “But if any worker were to report sick or show ARI (acute respiratory infection) symptoms, we will immediately pull aside and isolate the worker from his room-mates, and ensure that he receives the necessary medical care.” The health ministry did not say whether these isolated workers would eventually be tested, but said only those confirmed with Covid-19 infection would be reported in official daily case numbers. The health ministry did not respond to a request for further comment. Fisher, a senior consultant at Singapore’s National University hospital who chairs an infection control committee commissioned by the government, said this method would cause a lag in the reporting of cases.

Photograph: Reuters Singapore said it has been scaling up its testing capacity across the island, including in dormitories, from an average of 2,900 tests a day in early April to more than 8,000. Singapore says it has tested 2,100 people per 100,000, compared with 1,600 per 100,000 in the United States, and 1,000 per 100,000 in Britain. While the coronavirus has been spreading rapidly in the dormitories, many of which the authorities have sealed off, the spread in the community apart from the migrant workers has been much slower, with an average of 20 new cases a day over the past week. Fourteen people have died of the coronavirus in Singapore. Updated at 10.03am BST 9.12am BST The Philippines’ health ministry on Tuesday reported 19 more coronavirus deaths and 181 infections. In a bulletin, the health ministry said total deaths have increased to 530 while confirmed cases have risen to 7,958. But 43 more patients have recovered, bringing total recoveries to 975. 9.03am BST France is waiting for the prime minister, Édouard Philippe’s, much anticipated address to the Assemblée Nationale on Tuesday, detailing how France is going to “deconfine” on 11 May. The lockdown, in effect since noon on 17 March, has been strict to the point of draconian in France, so the measures – and details – are important. The address will cover six areas: Health: Masks: will they be mandatory for going out, if so how will people obtain them? Tests: how many and who Schools: This is a particular worry for parents and a thorny question for the government. How will they reopen safely on 12 May? The country’s scientific committee advising on Covid-19 has suggested schools remain shut until September and described Emmanuel Macron’s announcement that schools will open progressively on 12 May as a “political decision”. Work: Who can return to work and who should remain at home? Business: As above, what companies can reopen and how? Restaurants, cafés and bars ordered to close at midnight on 14 March, are anxious this should be as soon as possible, but it certainly won’t be 11 May and Philippe may not give a date. Transport: What obligatory measures will there be ie. will passengers have to wear masks? And where can people go within France and abroad? Public gatherings: What cultural and sporting events will be allowed and how many people in one place? Whatever the prime minister says has already been discussed and agreed with the president. The plan is the result of a fortnight of hasty consultation with French cabinet ministers who were all asked to come up with plans for the end of lockdown in their respective sectors, and the government’s Covid-19 scientific committee. After Philippe speaks, there will be a short debate in the lower house of parliament and a vote. Opposition MPs are demanding they be given 24 hours to consider the end-of-lockdown plan, but the government, which has a large majority, wants the vote this afternoon.

It said Europe’s largest economy shrank by 1.9% in the first three months of 2020 and is expecting a 12.2% contraction in the second quarter. A return to the pre-crisis level is expected for the end of 2021, Ifo said. Updated at 8.28am BST 8.25am BST The Scandinavian airline, SAS, said on Tuesday it could reduce its workforce by up to 5,000 full-time positions due to plunging demand and travel restrictions during the coronavirus outbreak. Airlines worldwide are cutting flights and costs due to the pandemic, and SAS said in a statement it expected limited activity during the key summer season. The company said last month that it would temporarily lay off up to 10,000 employees, or 90% of the airline’s total workforce, as the coronavirus brought international travel to a near standstill in March, while domestic travel has also been severely impacted. SAS CEO Rickard Gustafson said demand would probably be substantially lower this year and in 2021, while more normal levels could be reached in 2022. “That’s the scenario we are working towards, and it’s the best estimate we can give,” he told Reuters.

Norwegian is seeking to convert debt to equity in a bid to qualify for state aid as it seeks to survive the crisis. SAS, part-owned by Sweden and Denmark, added that the potential reduction of the workforce would be split with approximately 1,900 positions in Sweden, 1,300 in Norway and 1,700 in Denmark.

The lender reported pre-tax profits of $3.2bn, down 48% from the same period in 2019, citing credit losses from clients struck by the economic slowdown as a major cause. “The economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our customers has been the main driver of the change in our financial performance since the turn of the year,” newly confirmed CEO Noel Quinn said in a statement. Reported expected credit losses in the first quarter of the year were $3bn – $2.4bn more than the first quarter of 2019 and the bank’s biggest bad loan bundle in almost nine years.

Italian and British medical experts are investigating a possible link between the coronavirus pandemic and clusters of what appears to be Kawasaki disease, a severe inflammatory disease, among infants who are arriving in hospital with high fevers and swollen arteries. 7.42am BST China has criticised as “unfair and irresponsible” India’s decision to stop using Chinese testing kits for Covid-19 because of quality issues, in the latest strain in ties between the countries. The Indian Council of Medical Research, the top agency dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, said on Monday it planned to return kits for antibody tests procured from two Chinese firms because of poor accuracy. The Chinese embassy said it was deeply concerned by the Indian decision and Chinese authorities had validated the equipment produced by the two firms, Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech and Zhuhai Livzon Diagnostics. “It is unfair and irresponsible for certain individuals to label Chinese products as ‘faulty’ and look at issues with preemptive prejudice,” embassy spokeswoman Ji Rong said in a statement. The Chinese companies had exported equipment to several countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America without any problem, she said.

Photograph: Manish Swarup/AP The diplomatic flap comes days after China criticised an Indian decision to step up scrutiny of investments from neighbouring countries, seen as a move to stave off opportunistic takeovers by Chinese firms during the coronavirus outbreak. India ordered more than half a million Chinese kits for testing for antibodies to the coronavirus this month as a way to boost its screening, among the lowest per capita in the world. The antibody tests taken from blood samples do not always pick up early-stage infections but show whether a person had the virus in the past, even if the person had no symptoms. In comparison, the standard swab test determines whether a person has the virus at that moment by looking for it in secretions. Several Indian states said the Chinese tests had produced conflicting results. Updated at 8.24am BST 7.35am BST Three hundred thousand coronavirus masks sent to pregnant women in Japan as part of a government handout have been found to be faulty, media reports said, the latest in a string of complaints about how the government has dealt with the pandemic. The efforts of prime minister Shinzo Abe’s government to distribute protective cloth masks in its fight against the coronavirus have been marred by complaints about mould, insects and stains in a number of the masks handed out so far. Just days after it began supplying every household with two washable, reusable masks at a total cost of $430m, complaints emerged of soiled or defective products, many of them from pregnant women. By Tuesday, the number of defective masks distributed to pregnant women had risen to 300,000 out of 500,000, public broadcaster NHK reported. The masks are being sent out in order of priority, with pregnant women and care homes for the disabled at the head of the list, though private households in Tokyo are also starting to receive theirs. The health ministry was not immediately available for comment, but the health minister, Katsunobu Katō, told a Tuesday news conference the safety of all the masks would be verified. Updated at 7.36am BST 7.28am BST Austria's lockdown to be lifted at end of April General lockdown measures in Austria will expire on 30 April, said the country’s health minister, Rudolf Anschober. He said gatherings of up to 10 people will be allowed, and the main requirement for the public will be to respect distancing rules. Updated at 7.52am BST 7.24am BST Kim Jong-un may have missed a key holiday on 15 April because of concerns over the coronavirus, not because he is ill, South Korea’s minister for North Korean affairs said on Tuesday. The North Korean leader’s absence from public ceremonies on the birth anniversary of his grandfather and founder of the country, Kim Il-sung, was unprecedented, and he has not been seen in public since. That has led to days of speculation over his health. South Korean officials emphasise they have detected no unusual movements in North Korea and have cautioned against reports that Kim may be ill.

Photograph: Korea Summit Press Pool/AFP via Getty Images North Korea has said it has no confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but given the fact that the country has taken stringent steps to head off an outbreak, Kim’s absence from the ceremonies is not particularly unusual, unification minister Kim Yeon-chul, who oversees North Korea engagement, told lawmakers. He said at a parliamentary hearing It is true that he had never missed the anniversary for Kim Il-sung’s birthday since he took power, but many anniversary events including celebrations and a banquet had been cancelled because of coronavirus concerns. He said there were at least two instances since mid-January where Kim Jong-un was out of sight for nearly 20 days. “I don’t think that’s particularly unusual given the current (coronavirus) situation.” The US president, Donald Trump, said on Monday he has a good idea how Kim Jong-un is doing and hopes he is fine, but would not elaborate. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he was aware of reports on Kim’s health and he was was paying close attention to developments. North Korea had cancelled some large events, and imposed a border lockdown and quarantine measures in an effort to prevent an outbreak of the coronavirus. But if Kim Jong-un is hiding out due to fears surrounding Covid-19, it would “puncture a hole in the state media narrative of how this crisis has been perfectly managed”, said Chad O’Carroll, CEO of Korea Risk Group, which monitors North Korea. Updated at 7.35am BST 7.17am BST Hello everyone, it’s Jessica Murray here, I’ll be taking you through coronavirus developments across the globe for the next few hours. As always I’m keen to hear your experiences and observations - send them through to jessica.murray@theguardian.com / @journojess_ on Twitter, and I’ll do my best to respond to as many as I can. In the Chinese city of Wuhan, a laboratory has rejected claims it was the origin of the coronavirus pandemic. The head of the lab told Reuters the claims have no basis in fact, adding there were still no conclusive answers as to where the disease started. Conspiracy theorists have claimed Covid-19, now responsible for more than 200,000 deaths worldwide, was synthesised by the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), based in the city where the disease was first identified. Though the scientific consensus is that the coronavirus evolved naturally, such claims have gained traction. The US president, Donald Trump, said on 15 April that his government was investigating whether it had originated in the Wuhan lab. Yuan Zhiming, professor at WIV and the director of its National Biosafety Laboratory, said “malicious” claims about the lab had been “pulled out of thin air” and contradicted all available evidence. “The WIV does not have the intention and the ability to design and construct a new coronavirus,” he said in written responses to questions from Reuters. “Moreover, there is no information within the SARS-CoV-2 genome indicating it was manmade.” Some conspiracy theories were fuelled by a widely read scientific paper from the Indian Institute of Technology, since withdrawn, claiming that proteins in the coronavirus shared an “uncanny similarity” with those of HIV. However, most scientists now say Covid-19 originated in wildlife, with bats and pangolins identified as possible host species. “More than 70% of emerging infectious diseases originated from animals, especially wild animals,” Yuan said. “In recent years, we have seen increasing risks posed by close contact between humans and wild animals, with global climate change and the continuous expansion of human activities,” he said. All seven known human coronaviruses have origins in bats, mice or domestic animals, scientists say. Yuan also rejected theories that the lab had accidentally released a coronavirus it had harvested from bats for research purposes, saying the lab’s biosecurity procedures were strictly enforced. “High-level biosafety labs have sophisticated protective facilities and strict measures to ensure the safety of laboratory staff and protect the environment from contamination,” he said. 7.07am BST With that, I’ll hand over to my colleague Jessica Murray.

It exchanges Bluetooth handshakes with other phones with the app if you are near them for 15 minutes. My colleague Josh Taylor has a full explainer here. Related: Covidsafe app: how to download Australia's coronavirus contact tracing app and how it works 6.23am BST In Australia, the federal police have been called in to investigate a potential hoax about the country’s new coronavirus tracking app. The Australian government yesterday released its contact tracing app, called Covidsafe, which is based on Singapore’s. However, an image has been circulating on social media that claims to show a text from the app – telling the user they’ve been detected venturing outside their home and have 15 minutes to provide an excuse. Crucially, it’s not clear if the hoax text has actually been sent as a text to people’s phones, or it is a photoshop. Regardless, Australia’s health minister Greg Hunt said today it had been referred to the Australian Federal Police. “That investigation has begun, and anybody who is found responsible will be charged with a significant criminal offence,” he said. “To have a few people, or it may just be one person, who are doing something contrary to the public health messages, this isn’t a game. This is about life and death. This is about saving lives and protecting lives.” “The more people that are able to download and register, the more people who will be protected against inadvertently contracting a life-threatening disease,” he said. 5.51am BST Summary so far Donald Trump has said the US will conduct “serious investigations” into China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak and could pursue the country for billions in damages because China “could have stopped” the coronavirus. He also claimed that he had “a very good idea” about the health of Kim Jong-un, but “can’t talk about it now”. The president added that he “wishes [the North Korean leader] well”. Trump also said he does not take responsibility for reports that people have may ingested disinfectant after his recent comments on its effectiveness. The head of the Japan Medical Authority said it would be “difficult” to hold the Olympics, even after it was delayed until 2021, unless a vaccine is developed. New Zealand has partially relaxed restrictions and said that 75% of the economy is now operational as 1 million people return to work and restaurants open for takeaway. More than 2,200 Indonesians may have died from Covid-19, without being recorded in official death totals, according to a Reuters analysis. China has reported six new coronavirus cases and no deaths. Australia’s Bondi Beach has reopened as the state of New South Wales said it would partially ease restrictions by Friday. Updated at 7.12am BST 5.44am BST Germany has recorded 163 new deaths from Covid-19 and 1,144 new infections, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases The total death toll is now at 5,913 and total cases at 156,337. 5.38am BST In Nigeria, authorities have denied that Covid-19 is responsible for a surge in deaths from pneumonia. Doctors in Kano in the country’s north-west have reported a rise in fatal cases of pneumonia, but authorities have blaming malaria, meningitis, hypertension and other illnesses.

The videos were previously leaked, and show encounters from 2004 and 2015. The Pentagon said they released them to “to clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that has been circulating was real or whether or not there is more to the videos” . The video, and a full story is here: Related: Pentagon releases three UFO videos taken by US Navy pilots 5.07am BST The UN’s humanitarian affairs chief has said that the full impact of the pandemic has not yet hit the world’s poorest, but will in the next three to six months. Mark Lowcock said in a video briefing that it would cost $90bn to provide income support, food and health care to 700 million vulnerable people. He said two-thirds of the $90bn could come from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and the remaining third could be financed by a one-off increase in development assistance. The $90bn would be only 1 percent of the total combined stimulus packages that the world’s 20 richest countries have already put in place. “$90 billion is a lot of money but it is an affordable sum of money”, he said. Updated at 5.10am BST 4.57am BST The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, has said that the economic impact from the coronavirus will worsen in future, Reuters also reports. That’s after the pandemic already pushed South Korea’s economy in the first quarter into its biggest contraction since 2008. 4.32am BST In Hong Kong, leader Carrie Lam has said most civil servants will gradually return to work from May 4, Reuters reports. Hong Kong has reported no new infections for the second day in a row, and Lam said said outdoor sports facilities, libraries and museums would also reopen from Monday although they would still be subject to a ban on gatherings of more than four people. But the government had not yet decided whether to ease travel and social distancing restrictions that are due to expire next week. A key consideration for Lam will also be whether to ease cross-border travel restrictions with mainland China. Hong Kong has confirmed 1,038 cases and four deaths since the outbreak began in January. 4.03am BST And here is our piece for Australians in NSW on what the relaxed restrictions (from Friday) will mean: Related: NSW coronavirus restrictions will be partially lifted to allow limited visiting 3.51am BST And here is our fuller report on the latest odds of the Tokyo Olympics going ahead On Monday, Tokyo saw the number of daily confirmed cases drop below 100 for two days in a row, with 72 cases reported on Sunday and 39 on Monday, public broadcaster NHK said. The numbers of cases reported at the weekends and on Mondays tend to be lower because some testing facilities are not open throughout the week. Tokyo has reported almost 4,000 infections, by far the highest number among Japan’s 47 prefectures. Related: Holding Tokyo Olympics in 2021 will be 'difficult', Japanese health chief warns 3.40am BST China has reversed its tighter export controls on testing kits and other medical items, Caixin Global is reporting. For several month Chinese suppliers have been selling equipment to international buyers, or providing to the Chinese government to donate to other countries. After a few incidents of equipment not meeting standards, the Chinese government required Covid-19 test kits to be approved by the National Medical Products Administration and registered before they were exported. Now, according the report, exported products are now only required to meet the receiving country’s product standards. The new rule also applies to medical masks, scrubs, ventilators and infrared thermometers. In early April, China banned the export of equipment which didn’t meet its own standards, by requiring a domestic licence, but some manufacturers reportedly complained this was too difficult. The tight restrictions came after a series of controversial shipments which failed to meet international standards, including more than half a million facemasks which the Netherlands bought, more than 1.2m testing kits the Slovak government bought, and 50,000 which Spain bought. 3.32am BST And here’s the video of Trump’s comments from earlier: 3.19am BST The head of the Japan Medical Association has added his voice to speculation that the Tokyo Olympics, now due to be held next summer, could again be affected by the coronavirus pandemic. “Unless an effective vaccine is developed I think it will be difficult to hold the Olympics next year,” JMA president Yoshitake Yokokura told reporters in Tokyo on Tuesday. “I’m not saying at this point that they shouldn’t be held. The outbreak is not only confined to Japan ... it’s a worldwide issue.” Several health experts have cast doubt on plans to hold the Games next July and August. Last week, Kentaro Iwata, a specialist in infectious diseases, said he thought it “unlikely” that the Games would be held just over a year from now. “I am very pessimistic about holding the Olympic Games next summer unless you hold the Olympic Games in a totally different structure such as no audience, or a very limited participation,” he said. Japan’s organisers and the International Olympic Committee [IOC] agreed in March to postpone the Games by a year as the coronavirus spread across the globe. They have since said there is no “Plan B’’ other than working for the Olympics to open on July 23, 2021. But IOC member John Coates, who is overseeing preparations of the Tokyo Olympics, said this month it was still “too early to say” if the outbreak could further impact the Games. 3.01am BST There are growing fears of coronavirus spreading through Latin America’s crowded prisons after photos were released over the weekend of inmates in El Salvador packed tightly together during a search. Associated Press reported that “authorities crammed prisoners albeit wearing masks tightly together in prison yards while searching their cell.” Inmates are lined up during a security operation under the watch of police at the Izalco prison in San Salvador, El Salvador, Saturday, April 25. Photograph: AP This was after president Nayib Bukele ordered the crackdown after more than 20 people were murdered in the country Friday and intelligence suggested the orders came from imprisoned gang leaders. In Chile, the Puente Alto prison in downtown Santiago has more than 300 reported cases among 1,100 inmates. In the Dominican Republic, more than 5,500 inmates were tested at the La Victoria prison, with at least 239 testing positive. 2.39am BST 75% of New Zealand economy re-opens New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern is speaking now about the country’s lifting of its most extreme restrictions. Today, 400,000 Kiwis will return to work, and takeaway food services will re-open. But she said that New Zealanders should be more cautious than ever, due to the virus’s incubation period “It can take from two to 10 days for people to have been exposed to Covid-19 to come down with symptoms. That means we would not smell the smoke for a few weeks and that could put us back where we started before the lockdown. “With more people going back to work today, we need to be even more vigilant.” “Level three will see 400,000 more New Zealanders back at work, taking the total to 1 million Kiwis working. At level three, 75% of the economy is working, with building and construction, forestry, manufacturing and contactless retail starting up, major infrastructure projects start again today.” 2.33am BST More than 2,000 unreported Indonesian deaths More than 2,200 Indonesians have died from Covid-19, but were not recorded, according to an investigation from Reuters. The official death toll from the virus in the country is 765, but the new figures would make Indonesia the worst-hit Asian country after China. Reuters reporters Tom Allard and Kate Lamb said they reviewed data from 16 of the country’s 34 provinces. The most current data from the 16 provinces shows there were 2,212 deaths of patients under supervision because they have acute coronavirus symptoms. Indonesia’s health ministry uses the acronym PDP to classify these patients when there is no other clinical explanation for their symptoms. The data is collated by provincial agencies daily or weekly from figures supplied by hospitals, clinics and officials overseeing burials. It was obtained by Reuters by checking websites, talking to provincial officials and reviewing World Health Organization (WHO) reports. The 16 provinces account for more than three quarters of the country’s 260 million population. A senior member of the government’s Covid-19 taskforce, Wiku Adisasmito, did not dispute the Reuters findings but declined to comment on the number of coronavirus victims he believed were to be found among the patients classified as PDP. He said many of the 19,897 suspected coronavirus sufferers in Indonesia had not been tested because of long queues of specimens awaiting processing at under-staffed laboratories. Some people had died before their sample was analysed, he said. “I believe the vast majority of PDP deaths were caused by COVID-19,” said Pandu Riono, an epidemiologist at the University of Indonesia, citing their COVID-19 symptoms and that there was no other identified cause of death. 2.25am BST In Canada, just under half of people surveyed have said they would “have reservations” about sitting next to an Asian person on a bus, reports The Star. The poll, commissioned after a series of attacks on people of Chinese or Asian appearance, found 20% of Canadians surveyed thought it was “not safe at all” to sit next to an Asian person on a bus, and an additional 24% were “uncertain”. 2.17am BST Taiwan has thanked the US for lobbying for it to be included in the World Health Organization, Reuters reports. In a teleconference, Taiwan’s health minister, Chen Shih-chung, thanked the US secretary of health, Alex Azar “for the strong support extended by the United States for Taiwan’s participation in the WHO”. Direct, public interactions between ministerial-level officials from Taiwan and the United States are unusual as the two do not have official diplomatic ties/ The United States, like most countries, only has formal relations with Beijing, though it is Taiwan’s strongest backer on the international stage. 2.03am BST China reports 6 new cases and zero new deaths China has reported 6 new coronavirus cases (3 domestic and 3 from overseas) and no deaths, according to the country’s National Health Commission. That is up from 3 new cases total in mainland China yesterday. Three of the new cases were from Heilongjiang province and three were from returned travellers, according to the department. There were also 40 new asymptomatic cases, where people tested positive but had no symptoms, up from 25 new yesterday. The total number of cases in mainland China now stands at 82,836, and deaths at 4,633. 1.46am BST And in New Zealand, the country’s director general of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield reacted yesterday to Trump’s comments on bleach with nothing but silence. Pime minister Jacinda Ardern said they had not received any reports of Kiwis ingesting bleach, meaning that “no New Zealander has listened to or given any credence to that suggestion.” Dr Ashley Bloomfield 's response to the President's suggestion for Covid-19 treatment - absolutely priceless \uD83D\uDE02 pic.twitter.com/pQZQPxLkDn — Aimee (@Kiwi_things) April 27, 2020 Related: New Zealand's top health official reacts with stunned silence to Trump's disinfectant idea 1.33am BST Argentina passes 4,000 cases and extends lockdown Argentina hit a new high of confirmed coronavirus cases when it overtook the four thousand mark Monday. With 111 new cases reported, the country’s total reached 4,003 infected persons and 197 deaths so far. The national lockdown, which started 20 March, has been extended until 10 May, although one-hour outings within a five-block radius of homes will be allowed in a large part of the country. The exceptions are the capital city of Buenos Aires, the Greater Buenos Aires area and the main cities of Córdoba and Santa Fe, where the majority of Argentina’s population lives and where the largest number of cases are concentrated. The city of Buenos Aires leads with 34% of reported cases and the province of Buenos Aires with 26%. Buenos Aires city authorities say the lockdown in their area will probably remain total until the end of May at least given the continued growth of cases in Argentina’s capital. Updated at 1.48am BST 1.21am BST In his press conference earlier, US president Donald Trump also suggested that he would want to seek damages from China over their handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Trump was asked about a recent German newspaper editorial calling on China to pay Germany $165 billion. Asked if the US would consider doing the same, he said “we can do something much easier than that.” “Germany is looking at things, we are looking at things,” he said. “We are talking about a lot more money than Germany’s talking about.” “We haven’t determined the final amount yet,” Trump said. “It’s very substantial. “This is worldwide damage,” he said. “This is damage to the US, but this is damage to the world.” 1.15am BST Some more images of happy beachgoers returning to Bondi Beach in Australia.

Local media reported lines outside McDonald’s drive-through from 3am on Tuesday morning, and by 10am the food app Regulr – which many local cafes and restaurants are using to allow pick-ups – had crashed nationwide. Fast-food chains such as Dominos and Hells Pizza have warned customers to expect signficant delays as demand surges, and hired hundreds of extra employees to cope with the rush, and deliver food. NZ Domino’s general manager Cameron Toomey said “zero contact delivery”, more frequent hygiene and sanitisation practices, and physical distancing and temperature testing were now underway in all their stores, and essential workers would have priorities for pizza. Updated at 1.19pm GMT 12.59am BST Australia’s most populous state, New South Wales, has announced it will start easing its lockdown restrictions from Friday. Currently, social visits to friends and family are not allowed, unless you already live in the same house. From Friday, up to two adults will be able to visit another household. “Two adults will be able to go and visit anybody else in their home on the basis of care, on the basis of reducing social isolation and everybody’s mental health,” the state’s premier, Gladys Berejiklian said. However, people should still practice physical distancing and not visit friends if they were sick or even had “the mildest sniffle,” she said. Sydney’s iconic Bondi Beach also re-opened today, after weeks of closures due to overcrowding. Surfers walk as Bondi Beach reopens to surfers and swimmers. Photograph: Loren Elliott/Reuters Updated at 1.45am BST 12.44am BST And seeming to add to his criticism of China, Trump said that the response to coronavirus had led to “so much unnecessary death”. “It could have been stopped and it could have been stopped [faster] but someone a long time ago decided not to do it that way.” 12.36am BST Trump says he knows Kim Jong Un's health status and \"hopes he's fine\" Trump also claimed that he had “a very good idea” about the health of Kim Jong Un and said he wishes him well. The US president was asked if he had any information about the North Korean leader’s health. He said: “I can’t tell you exactly. Yes, I do have a very good idea but I can’t talk about it now. I just wish him well. “I hope he’s fine. I do know how he’s doing relatively speaking. We will see – you’ll probably be hearing in the not too distant future.” Updated at 1.50am BST 12.27am BST In that latest US briefing, the Trump also announced an 8-part plan for increasing testing. He introduced the chief executive of pharmacy chain CVS Health, who said it would expand testing to 1,000 of its 10,000 stores. 12.18am BST Hello and welcome to today’s rolling global coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. It’s Naaman Zhou here, bringing you the latest. Donald Trump has just given a White House briefing after an absence over the weekend, following his controversial remarks on Friday about injecting disinfectant. In a combative briefing, he said he “does not” take responsibility for reports that people have may have followed his suggestions which were universally discredited by medical experts. Trump also hit out at China, saying Beijing could have stopped the virus at its source and said his administration was conducting “serious investigations” into what happened: “We’re doing very serious investigations ... We are not happy with China,” he said. In other news, the World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, says that the agency sounded the highest level of alarm over the novel coronavirus early on, but that not all countries heeded its advice: “The world should have listened to WHO then, carefully,” he said. Other key developments over the past few hours include: The number of people confirmed to have coronavirus has passed 3 million according to Johns Hopkins University, with 207,583 deaths globally. Switzerland and Nigeria say they will begin easing its restrictions. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said he is concerned about people missing vaccines for diseases such as polio and measles because of the coronavirus pandemic. UK hospital deaths rose by 360, taking the total to 21,902. Mexico’s president declared the country had “tamed” its coronavirus outbreak, despite widespread suspicions that Covid-19 cases are being undercounted. WhatsApp claims to have cut viral messages by 70% after introducing a limit on the number of people to whom users could forward messages. Afghanistan has recorded its biggest one-day rise in cases, triggered by a continued surge of transmission in Kandahar.

As a child, on holiday in France, my face steaming above my own bowlful, I remember being shocked and fascinated by their colour and appearance, like mysterious alien organs. I think being taught to use one hinged mussel shell to pick out the flesh from another helped me overcome my suspicions, and I was an adventurous child who liked salt and would try most things – fussiness came later. Thirty years on, my son pokes, pinches and eats mussels in much the same way I did, showing almost, but not quite, as much enthusiasm as he does with red pizza and cocoa pops. Mussels inhale and filter the ocean at a rate of around 40 litres (9 gallons) a day. Nourishment and pollution are one and the same thing to them – so you need to know your ocean, or lake. My fishmonger in Testaccio market gets his mussels from Lago di Paola, on the coast between Rome and Naples. They are safe, good, cheap and best of all – like good guests arriving at your door – they bring lots of liquor. This one is a briny elixir of the sea released when the mussels are exposed to heat. It is the key to this recipe, a dish that makes my mouth water just thinking of it. Pasta con patate e cozze – pasta with potatoes and mussels – is a dish typical of Ischia, a small, volcanic island in the gulf of Naples. I find tugging mussel beards an extremely satisfying job – and they do need a tug, at which the mussel clenches back shut. Once they are thoroughly cleaned the mussels need steaming open, then lifting from their liquor and setting aside. You then use the intensely flavoured liquid – lip-smacking stuff – to finish cooking the par-boiled pasta and potatoes. Much of the liquor is absorbed by the pasta and potatoes as they bubble. Liquor that isn’t absorbed is thickened by the starch from the collapsing potatoes, olive oil and your stirring, creating a silky, creamy sauce. This way of cooking pasta is similar to that of risotto – in fact, it is called risottare la pasta. Related: A quick recipe for Italian soft almond biscuits from Rachel Roddy | A kitchen in Rome It is not a complicated method, but one that does require attention and a keen eye when the pasta is cooking. You are watching and waiting for the moment the liquor and starch unite into a sauce and thicken slightly, coating both the back of the spoon and the pasta. Depending on the amount of liquid, the starchiness of the potatoes and how the ingredients choose to behave on that particular day, you might need a little pasta cooking water. Practice is the way, but isn’t that almost always the case? Various pasta shapes work here. My favourite by far – and a favourite pasta shape full stop – is paccheri: a short, wide tube that is typical of Campania. In her encyclopaedic and brilliant book Pasta, Oretta Zanini de Vita suggests the origins of paccheri can be found in the onomatopoeic Neapolitan word paccarià, which means “to slap” – named so because the original fresh pasta, put quickly in the mouth, supposedly slapped the face. Whether you feel slapped or not, paccheri is a fullbodied and pleasing shape, especially when coated with a deeply flavoured sauce of land and sea, the tubes just the right size to catch the plump coral mussels and flecks of parsley. Pasta with potato and mussels The mussels can be steamed open in advance: just set the flesh aside and keep the liquor to one side, reheating it when you are ready. Serves 4 1kg mussels Olive oil A garlic clove, peeled, crushed A pinch of red chilli flakes 2 potatoes (about 400g) 450g pasta – paccheri/rigatoni/mezze maniche/pappadelle Parsley, finely chopped 1 Wash, scrub and scrape the mussels until they are clean. In a large deep frying pan with a lid, warm 4 tbsp olive oil with the chilli and the garlic, which you have peeled and crushed with the back of a knife. Cook until fragrant. 2 Add the mussels, stir, cover the pan and cook – shaking the it occasionally – until the mussels have opened and released their liquor. Use a slotted spoon to lift the mussels from the pan, letting any liquor in the shells drip back. When the mussels are cool enough to handle, pull the flesh from the shells and set aside. 3 Peel the potatoes and cut into short batons. Bring a large pan of water to the boil, add salt, the potatoes and pasta, then cook for 5 minutes or until half cooked. Drain, reserving some water – the pasta will still be very firm. 4 Bring the mussel broth back to the boil, add the pasta and potatoes, cover and cook for the rest of the pasta cooking time, shaking the pan from time to time, until it is al dente. If you are worried about the amount of broth, add a little pasta cooking water. In the last minute of cooking time, add the mussels and a handful of chopped parsley, stir and serve.

She has taken her father to a doctor’s appointment, held a conference call for her new clothing line, Mission Statement, and run to a meeting about one of the three TV shows she is currently producing, along with three films. “Constant everything!” she grins, looking casual and efficient in a sundress. She has arrived just in time to order a piece of salmon – to go. The two-time Oscar winner still has a lot left to accomplish. Swank, 44, has been having a busy summer. If you haven’t seen her for a while, that is due to her making a necessary choice. Just before Christmas 2014, her father Stephen, a former chief master sergeant in the Oregon air national guard, underwent a life-saving lung transplant. For three years, Swank was his sole live-in carer, which meant saying no to Hollywood – or, as she phrases it: “I was saying yes to something else that I wanted to be a part of.” Today, her dad is “really good,” she says. “It’s a long time coming.” So, too, is this moment in which the feverishly curious actor can finally make things happen. One of those is learning to tap dance, she says, pulling up a YouTube video of a group called the Syncopated Ladies, headed by one of her tap mentors, doing a staccato-glam routine over a Beyoncé speech about the female right to vote. “I’ve always wanted to tap dance since I was 20 – actually, since I was a teenager.” When she married the social venture entrepreneur Philip Schneider in California earlier this month, the couple surprised guests by performing a tap routine. And, of course, she is plunging back into acting. What They Had, a sibling drama that pairs Swank with Michael Shannon, a rare performer who can match her intensity, is coming out in the US this autumn, followed by the Australian apocalypse flick, I Am Mother. First up, though, is Trust, Danny Boyle’s 10-part bleakly funny miniseries about the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III in 1973. It premieres on BBC Two next month, with Donald Sutherland as the boy’s grandfather, the miserable oil miser John Paul Getty, and Swank the show’s emotional heart as John Paul’s desperate mother Abigail “Gail” Getty. Trust is the second retelling of the bloody saga in 12 months, after Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World, but Swank had no reservations in following Michelle Williams’ Golden Globe-nominated performance with her own turn as the working-class mother of four who marries into the money-hungry clan. “I said: ‘Danny, pretty much you had me at hello,’” she laughs. Gail is a terrific fit for Swank, who slips into the role as perfectly as she does her character’s shiny, burnt-orange blouses. (“I don’t know if you’d like those acrylic 70s outfits if you were in Rome in August, by the way,” she mock-groans. “You’re boiling every second of the day.”) Trust is so comically gothic it gives Sutherland a harem of cat-fighting mistresses and introduces his estate by panning across a garden full of black flowers and black geese. If that weren’t enough, minutes later one of the birds gets squashed by a car, the camera lingering over its guts. Swank in Trust: ‘I don’t know if you’d like those acrylic 70s outfits if you were in Rome in August.’ Photograph: FX TV Trust Then Swank cruises into the frame in Gail’s green station wagon, the straight-talking princess who must break the spell her father-in-law holds over his kin – and her missing son’s life. There is a supporting turn from Brendan Fraser as Fletcher Chase, an ex-CIA agent who functions as Getty senior’s one-man wrecking crew, complete with American flag bandana around his neck and an Ennio Morricone-esque cowboy trill as his theme music. “The most harrowing things in life, there’s gotta be levity in it or it’s just too heavy,” says Swank. It is clear from her voice that she knows this firsthand. There is some irony in Swank embracing the screwed-up Gettys, given the way she dotes on her own family. Or maybe not. “When I take a character on, I love them,” insists Swank. “They make me a better person because of it – I love that I don’t always understand how they walk in the world until I play them. And then I go: ‘Oh! What a beautiful way of seeing!’” Gail, says Swank, was resilient, stubborn and flawed, a mother forced to ask how she contributed to her son’s fractured adolescence, which left him flitting around Italy getting high, before getting kidnapped. Gail didn’t always make the best choices, she adds, stressing that she is psychoanalysing her character and not the woman, who now lives quietly in London, and in her 80s is the same age as grandpa Getty when her son went missing. But when Gail confronts an obstacle, she rams against it until she finally muscles through. Not unlike the actor playing her. I was from what people perceived as the wrong side of the tracks Swank’s ambitions hit their first road bump in grade school in Bellingham, Washington, when she auditioned for the part of Baloo the bear in a class production of The Jungle Book. Her teacher insisted she portray Mowgli, because, even at nine years old, “I had this really deep, raspy voice,” says Swank. She turned to the teacher and said: “I’ll have to think about that.” Of course, she said yes, and her love of the arts took hold. “When I was a kid, I felt like I was an outsider,” says Swank. Books and movies were her way to connect with different kinds of lives, maybe ones where people didn’t live in a trailer park in an industrial bay just south of the Canadian border. “I was from what people perceived as the wrong side of the tracks.” Note her choice of the word “perceived”. There is a legendary story about Swank that starts six years later when, aged 15, she left Washington to chase her acting goals. She and her mother, Judy, a newly single secretary, drove south to Hollywood with just $75 in savings and spent two months living out of their car. Sometimes acquaintances will sadly tut-tut about her hungry days splitting a $1.99 breakfast with her mother, and scraping together cash for a dollar slice of pizza at night. “I’m like: ‘No! It was awesome!’” says Swank. “It’s not a negative. It’s a memory you love because it just reminds you of pursuing something that you want. For me, I was moving to California and I was living my dream!” Plus, she smiles: “My mom really believed in me – and her belief made me believe in myself, which is everything. The best gift you can give a child.” Not long afterwards, Swank landed a villainous role as a snotty cheerleader in the comedy Buffy the Vampire Slayer. There, she first met her Trust co-star Donald Sutherland, who was cast as a vampire-slayer coach. He gave her a tip, too. “Donald said to me: ‘Can I give you some advice?’” recalls Swank. “‘Act less with your forehead.’” She didn’t take it. “I thought: ‘How do you say ‘Puh-leeeese, that’s so five minutes ago!’ without your forehead?!” Swank jokes, crinkling her face into a caricature of Valley girl disgust. Swank (centre) in Boys Don’t Cry, 1999. Photograph: Searchlig/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock There is a pause. Across the room, a stranger is snapping Swank without asking. She grins and shoots her a thumbs-up. “It’s like I’m part of the circus,” says Swank through her teeth, holding the smile. She is used to it, and is gracious, but you can sense the Bellingham girl inside of her will never stop thinking public attention is bizarre. The woman shows her mobile to her friends and seems to sigh that she should have got a better shot. Thankfully, she doesn’t have the gall to try again. “It’s weird when you see a camera pointed at you,” says Swank. “You kind of look around like: ‘Is there a rainbow out?’” But that is what happens when you win two best actress Academy awards before your 30th birthday, first for playing murdered trans kid Brandon Teena in Boys Don’t Cry, and again five years later for the part of hard-living boxer Maggie Fitzgerald in Clint Eastwood’s Million Dollar Baby. “All of a sudden you’re just famous,” she says, snapping her fingers. She knew from her first Hollywood days, that stretch when she was fighting for thankless gigs on Beverly Hills 90210, that “there were no roles like that, there was nothing else like that”. So she gave all of them everything she had, and people noticed. “I don’t know what I did in this life to deserve all this,” stammered Swank on stage at the Dolby Theater with her second statuette. “I’m just a girl from a trailer park who had a dream.” All genders should have the opportunity to audition for all types of roles This year is the 25th anniversary of Teena’s death. I ask if trans rights have improved in that time and Swank contemplates the question seriously. “I don’t know how we define better,” she says, finally. “Expanding awareness is definitely growth. We have a long way to go still.” Boys Don’t Cry definitely changed her own life. Glaad (the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) applauded it as the year’s outstanding film. She was flooded with letters from people who said the film saved them, gave them the courage to come out, a map to help their parents understand – and the hope necessary to stay alive. For more than a decade, people turned to Swank as a voice for a community. She recognised that her responsibility extended far past the film’s closing credits and helped the Hetrick-Martin Institute launch its first accredited high school for at-risk LGBTQ kids. We meet at a time when controversy is still swirling around the casting of Scarlett Johansson as a trans man in the drama Rub & Tug – Johansson later withdrew from the project, saying she had “learned a lot from the community since making my first statement about my casting, and realise it was insensitive”. Swank says there are people, “who have said I shouldn’t have done Boys Don’t Cry”. She understands this. It is complicated, and consciousness has grown a lot in the past two decades, thanks in part to the conversation her film started, back in an era when the script didn’t even use the word transgender. “At the time, the whole community was grateful that I did it because they said, had it been someone who was from this experience, people would have said: ‘Oh, you’re just telling your personal story.’” Fewer people might have bothered to see it. With Clint Eastwood in Million Dollar Baby, 2004. Photograph: Allstar/WARNER BROS/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar That was the uphill fight in 1999. Today’s battleground is different, having shifted from awareness to access. “What’s hard is that not everyone is given an opportunity, and that’s where I think the struggle is,” says Swank. Producers should take a risk on giving unknown trans actors a shot at stardom. The argument is often that there aren’t any trans actors who are famous enough to get a project made. But “nobody knew who I was when I did Boys Don’t Cry,” says Swank. “I was a newcomer – and the movie did well. “The important thing to remember is people are wanting to be seen for who they are,” she adds. “And people are fighting for their space in the world. That I understand. But I do think it can be a slippery slope, because I don’t think anyone should be pigeonholed. And I do think that all genders should have an opportunity to be an actor and tell their stories. And I think that all genders should have the opportunity to audition for all types of roles. I was honoured to be a part of the beginning of an important conversation. The community means a great deal to me.” And that conversation is ongoing, and will be for a while. “We all have the underlying sameness of wanting to be loved; to give love, to receive love. We all experience pain. It might be from different circumstances, but the pain is the same.” “I love people who persevere through adversity,” she says. Brandon. Maggie. Gail. Amelia Earhart. She played the aviator in 2009, the woman whose bones it was recently claimed had been found – again – on the Pacific island of Nikumaroro. Swank rolls her eyes. “They say that every week! I think she’s perhaps at the bottom of the ocean somewhere.” She would love to do an action movie soon, something “just flat-out entertaining”. Maybe someone will give her an excuse to tap dance. Either way, she is glad she has emerged from seclusion at a time when Hollywood is ready for more of the kind of female characters she has spent her career fighting to play. “Now there are more offers coming in than there ever have been.” So it is up to her, as an actor and an increasingly busy producer, to make the right choices. No stress, she shrugs, grabbing her to-go lunch as she heads to her next challenge. She has been ready for this since she was a kid tearing through a stack of Choose Your Own Adventure books. “Once I chose my adventure, I didn’t go: ‘Well, what would happen if I had gone that way?’” Swank laughs. “I was enjoying the journey I was on.” This article was amended on 31 August to correct the name of Hilary Swank’s husband. Trust starts on 12 September on BBC Two at 9pm.

But nonetheless, in the UK, we have a deep love for lasagne. We have made this month’s How to Eat subject our own. An early version of “loseyns” features in the 14th-century English cookbook, The Forme of Cury, while, in 2016, the Good Housekeeping Institute found that, 700 years later, it was still Britain’s second most popular ready-meal. That is some staying power, and may explain why lasagne has become an unexpected bit player in so many political bridge-building exercises. Left or right, it seems, leave or remain, we all adore lasagne. Even if, as How to Eat [HTE] – the series examining how to best eat Britain’s favourite dishes – will now explain, people are doing it all wrong. Probably. The lasagne variations Given that, even within Italy, lasagne (essentially, a catch-all name for savoury ingredients layered between pasta sheets) can range from a Ligurian pesto version to the Neapolitan carnevale of meatballs and boiled eggs, only a fool would attempt to disbar any of the potential iterations of lasagne. And HTE is just that fool. Let’s face it, not all lasagnes were created equal, and we should be upfront about that. HTE will concentrate on the lasagne alla bolognese because: 1) HTE’s mind is closed to the open lasagne, that impractical, unsatisfying confusion of huge pasta folds unsuited to conveying the accompanying oily sauces and, often, random ingredients. Every open lasagne could immediately be improved by being arranged in a stack formation, doused with béchamel and baked in the oven. 2) If you are looking for a metaphor for the self-defeating insularity of Brexit, look no further than Theresa May serving chicken lasagne (with boiled potatoes!) at Chequers. There is some ancient historical precedent for using chicken in lasagne, but, in 21st-century Britain, there is barely a dish in existence that would benefit from having beef replaced by this paltry meat. Alhough, in the Brexit wastelands of the 2040s, we may look back on the halycon days of chicken lasagne with fondness. It could be all turkey mince by then. 3) Like a good U2 song or a comfortable journey on a commuter train, eating an impressive vegetable lasagne is possible. But it is an experience so vanishingly rare as to be statistically insignificant. For every restaurant doing something exquisite with jerusalem artichokes or wild mushrooms, there are 10,000 lumpen veggie lasagnes layered with an overly sweet, overly acidic ratatouille-like slurry of “Mediterranean” vegetables that have all the sunshine flavour of an abandoned graveyard in Telford. If anyone ever talks to you about putting lentils in a lasagne, just run. And hide. You should be out of earshot before they complete the sentence. A roasted butternut squash lasagne. Photograph: Diana Miller/Getty Images/Cultura RF 4) Seafood lasagne, see vegetable lasagne – only with the added threat of tuna and poached salmon in the mix. 5) Some people suggest serving spinach with lasagne, in lasagne or, fiendishly, worked into the pasta sheets which, at first, you might imagine someone has amusingly augmented with green food colouring. Ignore those people. Say no to the spinach-lasagne crossover. Say no to lasagne verdi. A note on lasagne alla bolognese HTE defers to Felicity Cloake on the minutiae of how to cook lasagne, but it must make the case for dried egg pasta sheets as the building material of choice. There are experts, as diverse as Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Giorgio Locatelli, who insist on fresh pasta. But crucially the, respectively, River Café alumni and Michelin-starred chef can probably create pasta that, despite being thinner than a Tory promise on the NHS still retains its bite and structure. Most of us are not nearly that skilled. Instead, we produce, not gossamer-thin pasta sheets, but overly thick, galumphing great folios of flour and water that bring a dead, lead weight to a lasagne. A lot of commercial fresh pasta is similarly flawed. Dried lasagne sheets. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo Dried egg pasta is the way to go, particularly if you are a connoisseur (the kind of connoisseur who would fight their family members to the death for the prized corner portion of a homemade lasagne) of the crispy, slightly scorched curls of pasta at a lasagne’s exposed edges. Think of it as lasagne’s crackling. Note: under no circumstances should that pasta be replaced with grilled slices of aubergine. In terms of the filling, while it is tempting to say there is no such thing as too much cheese, in lasagne’s case that is incorrect. Layered with mozzarella or piled high with cheddar, it can quickly become a cloying, artery-clogging gloopfest. A circumspect top layer of intense parmesan (or grana padano, for the cost-savvy), perhaps mixed with a few breadcrumbs, is really all that lasagne needs. Garnishes It does not need any. No prissy basil leaves. No scattered flat-leaf parsley (the surest way to ruin that cheesy top layer). No crossed chives, the tell-tale mark left by the unimaginative chef. Served In a wide, shallow bowl with a broad rim (useful for balancing bread on, see below), which means the lasagne will sit squat in its own sauce, rather than those juices running all over the plate and going cold too quickly. Sides Does it need any? Arguably not; a well-made lasagne is really a self-contained meal. However, if not essential, certain sides are more preferable than others. In many quarters, there seems to be a carte blanche carbs-on-carbs ban when it comes to lasagne. And as Theresa May’s boiled potatoes prove, such combinations can be horrific. However, there is a whiff of snobbery to all this too, a sense that carbs are now somehow déclassé. Thickly buttered crusty bread with lasagne is delicious, if unsophisticated. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo A few chips alongside a lasagne can be a glorious thing. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo Yet, unsophisticated as serving thickly buttered crusty bread with lasagne may be, it is delicious. How could it not be? As you mop up beefy gravy, tomato, béchamel and cheese from around your bowl, you are, essentially, creating several fleeting bursts of the same flavours you love in everything from a Sunday roast to pizza. HTE may draw the line at the “lasandwich” – it is too much of a potentially good thing – but, a little bread, like a few chips (it’s cheesy chips … it’s chips’n’gravy; what’s not to love?), is a glorious thing. Note: avoid stiff garlic bread, it is neither manoeuvrable nor absorbent enough. Lasagne is more commonly served with a salad, which is far worthier and far less successful. True, if your lasagne is exceptionally rich, greasy and filling, a side-salad can make a pleasant palate-cleanser. But it must be served separately. No one wants to see those salad leaves wilt into a bowl that is swimming in hot gravy, béchamel and cheese. A green salad is a worthy side to a lasagne. Photograph: fotogal/Getty Images/iStockphoto For such a salad, HTE would recommend a mix of peppery watercress, sweet red oak leaf etc, simply dressed with oil and salt. No rocket (increasingly woody and hedge-like) and no overly bitter combinations of frisee or radicchio, either. They would ruin your next mouthful of lasagne. As will, for different reasons, creamy chopped, mayo- or ranch-dressed salads, or any salads that involve, say, tomato or beetroots. Who wants to eat cold vegetables (please do not write in, HTE is fully aware that tomatoes are not vegetables), halfway through a hot meal? If, for medical reasons, your body is crying out for vitamins, then peas or broccoli are not the worst vegetable options. They have a natural affinity with cheese and meaty gravy and, texturally, fold unobtrusively into the wider meal. Beyond that, on an arc from kale (too assertive), via grilled courgettes (likewise, a potentially mineral clanger) to roasted peppers (unholy slime at the best of times), the vegetables that do not work with lasagne are many and varied. This is a dish best left to stand alone. Sauces One Guardian colleague (“I’m an animal”) confesses to loving reheated lasagne with loads of ketchup. HTE has checked and, unfortunately, this is not a sackable offence. Eating cold lasagne – yes, shrivelled, set, solidified lasagne – is in the same bizarre ballpark. As 10cc once sang: “Life is a minestrone… death is a cold lasagne.” When Lasagne is surely an evening meal, too filling for lunch (when you can ill afford the mid-afternoon carb crash), but perfect for when you want to flop down on the sofa in front of the TV, put your brain in neutral (or watch an improving documentary about Renaissance fresco restoration on BBC4) and let yourself melt into the warm, comforting arms of a bowl of lasagne as big as your head.

The Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, announced on Wednesday that a national plebiscite would take place on 2 October for voters to either accept or reject the accord. Iván Márquez, the Farc’s top negotiator, said: “We have won the most beautiful of all battles: [the battle] of peace for Colombia.” Farc peace deal: rebels and Colombian government sign accord to end war Sanders staff flee legacy project No sooner had Democratic primary runner-up Bernie Sanders announced the Our Revolution grassroots project to “continue the struggle for justice”, than key staff began to quit over its leadership and fundraising structure. The departures, including the entire organizing department and the group’s digital director, came after Sanders’s former campaign manager Jeff Weaver was appointed president of the group. Notwithstanding this setback, Sanders said the project planned to support “progressives at every level”. Fleeing the Bern: half of staff quit Sanders legacy project before it begins Marijuana admitted to Oregon state fair Prize-winning marijuana plants will be included in the state fair’s agricultural line-up in a move that cannabis advocates call a monumental step in removing the stigma around a product. The marijuana plants will only be viewable by those 21 and older. And the plants will be guarded by security. “Cannabis is taking its rightful place next to tomatoes and other agriculture,” said Don Morse, with the Oregon Cannabis Business Council. Prize-winning pot: top marijuana plants debut at Oregon state fair Sex toys, not machine guns In another first for student democracy, hundreds of undergraduates at the University of Texas at Austin have signaled their opposition to the state’s “campus carry” gun law by carrying dildos to an anti-gun demonstration. Under a new law, gun owners aged 21 and older are permitted to carry concealed handguns in most places on public university campuses. “We have crazy laws here but this is by far the craziest, that you can’t bring a dildo on to campus legally but you can bring your gun,” said Rosie Zander, a 20-year-old history student. Cocks Not Glocks: Texas students carry dildos on campus to protest gun law The speed of melting ice The Greenland Ice Sheet is losing 110,000 Olympic size swimming pools worth of water each year, a new study estimates. The findings, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, used data from the Cryosat 2 satellite to make high-resolution measurement of Greenland. Lead author Malcolm McMillan from the Centre for Polar Observation and Modeling estimates approximately 270 gigatons of ice loss per year for 2011–2014. Global warming is melting the Greenland Ice Sheet, fast Pizza by drone Global pizza giant Dominos will become the first to carry out regular deliveries by drone in New Zealand from late 2016. Speaking after the Domino’s test flight this week, the country’s transport minister, Simon Bridges, said the country was an “ideal environment” for drone delivery. Don Meij, the chief executive of Domino’s Pizza Enterprises, said: “We’ve always said that it doesn’t make sense to have a two-tonne machine delivering a 2kg order.” Domino’s planning drone pizza delivery service in New Zealand Hope Solo given six-month ban The goalkeeper was given a six-month suspension for calling Sweden “a bunch of cowards” at the Olympics in Rio for their defensive play against Team USA. Solo also angered fans in Brazil when she posted a photo on social media of herself covered with mosquito netting and armed with insect repellant. Fans chanted “Zika!” each time she kicked downfield. The player, who was previously suspended for 30 days early in 2015 for her conduct, will not be eligible for selection to the national team until February.

Bristol isn’t the most beautiful city in the world (the blitz and brutalist post-war planning saw to that), but it compensates with a unique, offbeat charm. Cycle paths, community farms, street art, street food and a potent live music scene make it a multicultural, civic-minded kind of place with an alternative approach to city planning, green credentials and an unshowy, creative vibe – characteristics that also make it a family-friendly destination. There’s no need to spend hundreds of Bristol (or any other) pounds to have a good time here (Leigh Woods, Blaise Castle Estate, Cabot Tower, M Shed and many more big-hitters are free to visit, including the famous Clifton Suspension Bridge if you’re on foot), but two fee-paying attractions are must-dos. SS Great Britain. Photograph: Adam Gasson The first is the SS Great Britain (family ticket for two adults and up to three children, £37), which is easily reached by bus and foot, but is more fun approached via the water: hop on a Bristol Ferry at the back of Temple Meads station and it’s a 25-minute ride (adult single £3.10, child £2.60, under-5s free). Brunel’s radically engineered ship is probably the city’s most famous attraction, and rightly so. Younger kids can dress up as Victorian cabin boys, have a go at punchbag-boxing on deck, pinch their noses at the reek of horses and chickens in the hold, and jump when they try to open a toilet door in steerage only to find a booming recorded voice telling them it’s occupied. Older children and adults will get more context about how the design rewrote the rules of shipbuilding – and can pay extra to climb the rigging. At-Bristol Science Centre. Photograph: James Beck The other must-visit is the At-Bristol Science Centre (family ticket for up to four £43) just across the water from the SS Great Britain on Millennium Square: take a cross-harbour ferry (90p, under-5s free), then it’s a five-minute walk. Its hectic medley of hands-on exhibits includes plenty for younger children to turn, splash, fly, draw or build, while older children could just come away with a grasp of the science behind its giant bubbles, pulley-parachutes, soundwave machines and animation screens. Even toddlers can get on board with a builders-themed play area kitted out with soft bricks and wheelbarrows. This is the first attraction we’ve ever had to drag our two under-fives away from (wristband entrance tickets mean you can go in and out), but if the standard attractions start to wane there’s a regular programme of demos and workshops, plus an on-site planetarium, where bookable shows cost £2.50 per child and are well-judged for different ages. If you’re an outdoorsy lot, hire bikes and pedal out along the Bristol to Bath Cycle Path. The 13-mile off-road route between Temple Meads and Bath Spa stations is wide, asphalted and peppered with sculptures. Children too young to cycle the whole route might manage the seven or so miles from the centre of Bristol to Warmley, where Warmley Waiting Room does bacon rolls, cream teas or Marshfield ice-creams, and there’s a Tardis-shaped toilet. Where are all the other kids? The Bristol International Balloon Fiesta. Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA Ashton Court Estate’s 850 acres of woods and parkland are free to explore and include cafes, a deer park, natural play area, miniature railway and a mountain bike hire and skills coaching centre. Crowds descend for the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta each August, but balloons take off from the estate most mornings and early evenings throughout the summer – a sight that’s always worth catching. The other reliable local all-rounder is Tyntesfield, a National Trust property on the western fringes of the city (from £22.70 per family, free for members). At the centre of this 540-acre estate is a gothically gloomy grade I-listed Victorian mansion, proving that where there’s muck there really is brass (it was built with a fortune made flogging guano). Aerial view of Tyntesfield. Photograph: David Goddard/Getty Images The house itself doesn’t hold much appeal for very young children. Save the higher entrance fee and explore the grounds instead; there are good play areas beside the site’s two cafes, and the Trust has recently built a vast woodland play zone on a slope above the house, with treehouses, rope swings, climbing frames and a den-building village. It’s quite a hike to get to (especially with a buggy), but you’ll be glad you kept going once you find it. Two city farms are also worth making a beeline for - and they’re both free. St Werburghs, to the north, is small but has a great, Gaudí-esque cafe with a play area, food made (sometimes) with ingredients picked from the neighbouring allotments and, next door, a bohemian pub with a sunny, family-friendly garden. Windmill Hill is more central and has a wider range of play areas, animals and events (kids’ cookery workshops, circus skills, street food pop-ups). Its cafe is currently squished into a temporary site while a new one is being built, but the new, improved space should be open by June. Willsbridge Valley local nature reserve Photograph: PR Less busy is Willsbridge Valley (also free), a local nature reserve whose wildlife gardens and woodland walking trails (great for balance bikes and buggies) are run in partnership by the Avon Wildlife Trust and a local community group. Stop for lunch at the cafe in restored mill buildings, then dip your toes in the stream just behind it. I’m hungry Swoon Gelato. Photograph: Dan Regan If you’re in the city centre and everyone’s screaming for ice-cream, pizza or fish and chips, help is at better-than-average hand in the shape of Swoon Gelato, Pi Shop and Salt & Malt. The first on that list, overlooking College Green, does superior takes on classic strawberry, vanilla and chocolate ices as well as myriad seasonal flavours (don’t miss the chocolate sorbet) and Swoon on a Stick (think posh Magnum). Gelato available in a bambino portion also wins them brownie points. Pi Shop, just across the waterfront, is a good option if you want to steer clear of nuggets and cartoon character placemats. A stylish but laid-back pizza spot a little away from the hullabaloo, it has good-value children’s pizzas, colouring sheets and high chairs. These mean it’s packed with families in the early evening, despite its grown-up feel (walls are whitewashed, tables are hewn from wood and metal, and the drinks list includes a mean citrus-and-herb aperol spritz). Cracking pizzas, too (try a Wye Valley asparagus with tallegio, ewe’s curd and rocket). No 1 Harbourside Photograph: PR Salt & Malt is Josh Eggleton’s sustainable, family-friendly fish restaurant at Cargo 2, a cluster of food outlets in shipping containers set to open imminently at Wapping Wharf. If you can’t wait, and you have your own wheels, drive out to the original restaurant at Chew Valley, just south of the city, and follow a walk around the adjacent lake with portions of battered cod, haddock, plaice or scampi. For a sit-down Sunday lunch or dinner in the centre, make your way to No 1 Harbourside. A big, light space with children’s toys and colouring pads peppered among its wooden tables, this waterside restaurant holds a Sustainable Restaurant Association three-star rating for its ethical approach to food. Much – though not all – of it is vegan or vegetarian (it does outstanding Buddha bowls with toasted quinoa, spiced carrot hummus, dukkah, pickled beetroot and turnip, and purple sprouting broccoli marinated in lemongrass and ginger) and a new children’s menu includes made-from-scratch pasta sauces and posh fish finger sandwiches. I’m tired… Kyle Blue ‘boatel’ Photograph: PR The city’s new ‘boatel’, the Kyle Blue (dorm beds from £29, doubles from £49, family rooms for four from £102), opened in January at Wapping Wharf. What once served as the green room for guests on Richard & Judy’s TV show at Liverpool’s Albert Dock was shipped south, overhauled and fitted out with geothermal heating, powerful showers, customised wooden bunks, plump duvets and free wifi, tea and coffee. Bristol YHA. Photograph: Matt Selby The peace is worth splashing out for: this part of the waterfront is quiet at night, and we woke only to the gentle sounds of swans smacking the water and rowers gliding past. There’s a self-catering kitchen, but if you don’t want to make your own breakfast, Brunel’s Buttery kiosk, two steps away, does a brisk trade in bacon sandwiches. More of a landlubber? Family rooms at Bristol YHA, just over the water, start from £39 for four. Or nearby Brooks Guest House has standard triple bedrooms, or rooftop Rocket trailers sleeping four (last-minute rates for these start at around £87 B&B). • For more information see visitbristol.co.uk","Id":"travel/2017/may/23/city-breaks-with-kids-bristol-family-day-trips-food","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webTitle":"City breaks with kids: Bristol","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/may/23/city-breaks-with-kids-bristol-family-day-trips-food","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/may/23/city-breaks-with-kids-bristol-family-day-trips-food","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":1390,"webPublicationDate":"2017-05-23T05:30:44Z","id":"travel/2017/may/23/city-breaks-with-kids-bristol-family-day-trips-food","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"City breaks with kids: Brighton","body":"I’m bored! Brighton’s Palace Pier may be the city’s most iconic landmark but in my experience a trip there with kids rarely ends well. It’s not just that the rides are expensive – though they truly are: £4.50 for the log flume, £2.50 for the carousel or unlimited ride wristbands £70 for a family of four – it’s that the rides are also short. As soon as they finish one, your children are tugging at your arm for another go, or pulling you towards the ice cream kiosk or the churros stand or the sweet shop. The structure itself oozes faded seaside glamour or, in kids’ eyes, bright noisy flashing stuff, but it’s most excitingly viewed from below, on a boat tour (£8.50 adult, £6.60 under-16s, Watertours.co.uk) which my children, aged four and six, both love. Trips lasts for around 45 minutes and run from mid-March to November except in stormy seas. Brighton beach and pier. Photograph: Paul Mansfield Photography/Getty Images With slightly older children you could hire a kayak or standup paddleboard (from £10 an hour, Brighton Watersports) and play about in the sea between the Palace Pier and the eerily beautiful skeleton wreck of the West Pier. The best place to see the West Pier is from i360 observation tower (adult £13.50, 4-16 £6.75). Weekends and Wednesdays in summer, and Sundays in all school holidays, there’s a free Punch and Judy show at the bottom of the i360, run by Professor Glyn Edwards, who has been performing the act for 50 years. Parents may roll their eyes but my kids guffaw the whole way through. The Volks Railway on Brighton seafront. Photograph: Alamy Another firm seafront favourite for children is the historic Volks Electric Railway train, which starts just east of the Palace Pier at the end of Madeira Drive and runs along the coast for a mile. It has open-air carriages and goes past the nudist beach, which always makes my kids giggle, even though a strategic mound of pebbles protects the modesty of bathers. It’s the world’s oldest electric railway, opened in 1883. It’s temporarily closed for refurbishment but should reopen in the early summer of 2017. My eldest son likes Brighton Museum’s World Stories treasure trail at the Royal Pavilion (one adult and two children £8.20) and learning about the pharaohs in the Ancient Egypt gallery. Both enjoy the Toy and Model Museum (£14 for two adults and three kids), mostly to watch the giant 1930s train set in action, although they also enjoy the old-fashioned teddy bears, Meccano sets and penny arcade games, especially the one where the puppets can be made to dance. A stuffed red squirrel at the Booth Museum of Natural History. Photograph: Alamy A more surprising hit with my family is the Booth Museum of Natural History, a short way inland from the seafront on Dyke Road. It was originally a Victorian collector’s private museum and entry is free, though donations are encouraged. I’ll always find it slightly uncomfortable to be surrounded by stuffed dead animals, but my kids on the other hand were in their element. Their eyes widened at the giant brown bear mother and cub at the entrance and then galloped excitedly from one exhibit to another. My younger son liked the lion, zebra and the extinct Tasmanian tiger best, while his elder brother was more in to the rare owls, ospreys and eagles. We also saw the bones of a dodo and a sinister-looking python skeleton. Where are all the other kids? Low tide near the remains of the West Pier. Photograph: Paul Mansfield Photography/Getty Images While few kids will tire of paddling on Brighton’s long stretch of pebble beach, which is lifeguarded from May to September, and skimming stones into the sea, under-fives will also love the paddling pools at Kings Road playground, just west of the i360, and at Hove Lagoon, an easy 15-minute cycle along the seafront to the west. Hove Lagoon also has a popular skate park, playground, wakeboard cable and watersports centre and Norman Cook’s Big Beach Café. My kids love it there but their favourite playground in summer is The Level close to the centre of Brighton, mainly because it has fountains people can dance about in on hot days and the city’s most imaginative playground. They stand awestruck watching the local skateboarders and BMXers in the skate park. A teenager cycles past beach huts on Brighton’s seafront. Photograph: Rex Features We love cycling along the seafront as a family. Bikes can be hired from Amsterdammers’ by Brighton station, from £7 for adult-and-child bikes for three hours. It also has cargo bikes and kids’ seats. And from summer 2017 the city will have its own bike share scheme. Most visitors to Brighton barely move much beyond the Palace Pier and the Lanes so if you take a short cycle in either direction the crowds will quickly thin out. Our two favourite rides are west to Hove Lagoon (as mentioned above) and east to Ovingdean, passing the boats at Brighton Marina, and along the dramatic chalk undercliff path (shared with pedestrians). I’m hungry La Choza Photograph: La Choza There are plenty of places offering good value breakfasts in Brighton. Try Little Miss Piggies in Kemptown for fry-ups, Joe’s Café inland towards Preston Park for breakfast hashes and milkshakes. My boys love the pancakes at Moksha Caffe on York Place by St Peter’s Church. I also like the zero -waste ethics of Silo, so we sometimes go there for porridge or honey toast. In Hove, the banana bread and crumpets at Treacle are delicious, and the Monmouth coffee is great. The Hidden Pantry also has good brunch and lunch options for kids (sausage and fish finger sandwiches). The Hidden Pantry Photograph: The Hidden Pantry Our favourite lunch haunts include La Choza, which can get busy, but the quesadillas, and crispy fish burritos are excellent. My boys are also rather taken by the burgers at Lucky Beach on the seafront. There are lots of amazing veggie restaurants. The focaccia pizza and halloumi burgers at Food for Friends are favourites of ours. Planet India does lovely vegetarian curries and the Infinity Foods Café and Iydea are also good options. The chain restaurants Pho, Leon (both close to the Lanes) and pizza joint Fatto A Mano (in Hove and on London Road) are reasonably priced fall-back options. I’m tired Strawberry Fields Photograph: Strawberry Fields Strawberry Fields is a bright and cosy B&B just off the seafront in Kemptown. Its attic rooms are great for families and start at £45 a night. The YHA is centrally located and good for Brighton style on a budget: family rooms start at £29. The Holiday Inn may not be the most exciting brand in the business but the Brighton one is right on the seafront and many rooms have stunning sea views. Family rooms start at £77. Starlings over the West Pier. Photograph: Alamy Brighton is very much an Airbnb hotspot. It’s the company’s second most popular English city for rentals after London (it’s fourth overall in the UK, after Edinburgh and Glasgow) and there are plenty of cool spaces for families on a budget. If you can’t find what you want for your money in Brighton, look west towards Hove. From there, buses to Brighton are quick and frequent, or it’s an easy 10-minute cycle or stroll along the seafront.","Id":"travel/2017/feb/13/brighton-hove-children-kids-sights-museums-cafes","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webTitle":"City breaks with kids: Brighton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/feb/13/brighton-hove-children-kids-sights-museums-cafes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/feb/13/brighton-hove-children-kids-sights-museums-cafes","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":1150,"webPublicationDate":"2017-02-13T06:30:06Z","id":"travel/2017/feb/13/brighton-hove-children-kids-sights-museums-cafes","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"PM announces new business restrictions to stop Covid-19 spread – as it happened","body":"11.49am GMT Still confused about what has been shut down? Pin this to your browser, we will probably be updating it as the week goes on. Related: Australia coronavirus shutdown: which places are closed and which are open Updated at 12.07pm GMT 11.36am GMT The national cabinet's new announcements Let’s quickly recap what was announced tonight. From midnight tomorrow, all libraries, museums, galleries, beauty salons, tattoo parlours, shopping centre food courts, auctions, open houses, amusement parks, arcades, indoor and outdoor play centres, swimming pools, and indoor exercise activities will be shut down. That adds to the earlier closures, enforced from midday Monday, of all cafes and restaurants for everything other than takeaway or deliveries, as well as the closure of pubs, clubs, casinos, gyms and places of worship. Weddings will be restricted to five people including the couple. Funerals will be restricted to 10 mourners. Hairdressers and barbers remain open for appointments of less than 30 minutes; outdoor personal training and boot camps can continue for groups of less than 10. All retail stores, including supermarkets and bottle shops, remain open. All Australians have been told to stay at home except for essential outings, including work, grocery shopping, and medical appointments and supplies. Exercising outside alone or with a friend is fine. States and territories will look at possibly making it an offence to hold house parties. Dinner parties, barbecues and children’s birthday parties should not be held. Gathering in groups in public, even small groups of friends in a park, should also not occur. Schools remain open. After the Easter holidays, Morrison says schools in the ACT and Victoria that are currently closed will reopen. All schools will offer a mix of distance and in-person learning, and there will be efforts made to ensure vulnerable teachers do not have to go to work. There is now a travel ban on Australians going overseas except in exceptional circumstances. Updated at 11.41am GMT 11.22am GMT The national cabinet will meet again tomorrow night and discuss the issue of rent relief, which was on the agenda tonight but not resolved. The supply of personal protective equipment – face masks, hand sanitiser, etc – will also be on the agenda tomorrow, as will the continued supply of tests and testing materials. Updated at 11.29am GMT 11.20am GMT Asked how he intended to get this information about social distancing restrictions out to the general public, Scott Morrison said there would be a text message campaign happening soon. He said the media also had a role to play in getting that information out and urged people to share the official campaign among their friends. The text messaging, yes, that will be coming very, very soon – very soon. We will be using all of those devices to get that message out, but I think it’s pretty clear that most people, if not every person in this country, would know that the coronavirus is having an impact on our country and on the lives of Australians. I mean, it is hard to avoid when you look at the Centrelink queues and not understand that something very serious is going on. So I would encourage Australians to seek out that information from the trusted sources. Updated at 11.31am GMT 11.17am GMT Centrelink’s mutual obligation requirements have been suspended until 31 March and this will be extended beyond that time if needed, Morrison says. He suggests there will be some industries that need to hire people during the pandemic, including Centrelink call centres, which are hiring 5,000 new staff. Updated at 11.34am GMT 11.14am GMT Scott Morrison is asked why personal trainers are able to work with groups of 10 people, while weddings are limited to five. He says that is because boot camps and personal training sessions are businesses. Weddings, we note, are also businesses. On the boot camp issue, Morrison says: That is a business, that is someone’s livelihood, and you are saying that I should turn their livelihood off ... I am not going to be cavalier about people’s jobs and their businesses. Updated at 11.34am GMT 11.12am GMT This is a pretty extensive list, so I will try to list them individually. All these changes come into force at midnight tomorrow. Included in the new ban: Auction houses and open house inspections Food courts in shopping centres (shopping centres themselves remain open) Outdoor and indoor markets (states and territories may leave some major food markets open) Beauty salons including waxing, tanning and nail salons Tattoo parlours Amusement parks and arcades Indoor and outdoor play centres Galleries, museums, and libraries Swimming pools Allowed to remain open or take place, with restrictions: Hairdressers and barber shops, with strict social distancing and provided appointments do not go for more than 30 minutes Personal training and boot camps must be limited to 10 people Weddings are limited to five people including the couple and celebrant Funerals limited to 10 mourners Heavily recommended against, with state and territory laws to follow: Dinner parties, house parties, and in-home gatherings Gatherings in public places, like parks 11.07am GMT Brendan Murphy says the national cabinet has not adopted the advice of the Group of Eight university experts because it “certainly wasn’t a unanimous view”. He says the Group of Eight position was “very seriously considered”, but he is reluctant to recommend very severe restrictions, which the universities call for, before they are necessary. Updated at 11.36am GMT 11.05am GMT Scott Morrison is asked about the queues forming at Centrelink, caused by the first round of social distancing measures that left more than a million people unemployed. The closures announced tonight will leave thousands more without jobs. Morrison says the government is “deeply sorry”. I would say to Australians, yes, we are terribly sorry, but at the same time, we are asking Australians, even in these most difficult of circumstances to be patient. Everyone is doing their best. What we are dealing with is unprecedented. No system is built to deal with the circumstance and events we are facing as a nation. I would urge people, as difficult as it is, work with us, we are working to get it as high and far as we can, but we have had multiple, many times over what is expected from the system, and it has been upgraded and upgraded again and will be upgraded again. He says it may take “a few days” for people to be able to sign up to welfare but the support “will get to you”. Updated at 11.07am GMT 11.01am GMT The ABC’s Andrew Probyn asks if schools are required to remain open, they are becoming “human petri dishes” for the virus. Scott Morrison does not like this question. I think it is important, Andrew, [that] media don’t use that alarmist language. I don’t think it helps. I would encourage more moderate language on the issues, particularly based on the medical advice you’ve heard from us day after day on this issue. I would encourage a more measured way of talking about these issues, because I think that can cause unnecessary alarm amongst parents. Morrison says he expects schools to reopen after the Easter break with a mix of online and in-person learning. Brendan Murphy repeats that children are not likely to be at significant risk from the virus, but says that teachers who are vulnerable should be allowed to stay home. We do not see fit, healthy children with this virus and schools can do things to make them a safe place, with good hygiene ... some parents are choosing to keep their children at home and we think a well-structured class room is better than children roaming the community, which they probably would. Updated at 11.11am GMT 10.56am GMT Scott Morrison says he hopes the measures will not be extended to shutting down retail stores, and says he believes that by cracking down on social gatherings, such as dinner parties and casual football games, a retail ban will not be necessary. But it is important for people to go to the shop. It is important to go to the shopping centre. It is important that they get access to these normal services. It is important for them, because they need it, it’s also important for our economy that it continues to operate and function as much as possible. So I don’t leap to that conclusion. Morrison says he has seen some people suggest Australia should move to a total lockdown, as Italy did. Be careful what you wish for on something like that. Be very careful. Because that would need to be sustained for a very long time. And that could have a very significant and even more onerous impact on life in Australia. And we should seek to try to avoid that where it is possible Updated at 11.05am GMT 10.53am GMT On the tougher social distancing rules announced tonight, Brendan Murphy says: Because of the great rise in cases, we felt it was very important to recommend that those restrictive measures be well articulated and made clear and to some extent tightened, because we have to get people to take this seriously. We have to change the way we interact, as human beings, in our society, for quite a long time. This virus will be with us for some time. We have to all think about avoiding any unnecessary interactions where you are close to someone and could place them at risk. These measures are really draconian. We know that. But if we’re going to control community transmission, we have to stop the capacity of this virus from spreading from person to person. And I have said many times, it is a long haul and that is why we are keen to keep society functioning but keep society safe. Updated at 10.57am GMT 10.50am GMT The chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, says he is very worried about the rate of rise in cases of Covid-19 being reported in Australia. We are very worried about the rate of rise of the number of coronavirus cases in Australia, particularly over the last few days. It is a very, very steep growth and it is very concerning. Still, a significant proportion of those new cases are returned travellers or contacts of returned travellers ... I want to emphasise again that we are really serious now about a returned traveller. You leave the airport, you go home and stay there for 14 days, and the states and territories will be checking on you. We will not tolerate anybody putting the community at risk as a returned traveller. Murphy says there is no exception to the requirement that returned travellers stay home for 14 days. So returned travellers, please, stay at home, don’t go anywhere on the way from the airport or the cruise ship or wherever you are from. He says there have been cases of returned travellers going to the chemist, and even people who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 going to the chemist. If you are isolating because you are a positive case or you’re a contact, you go home and you isolate and you obey those rules. That is a really, really important part of the control. Updated at 10.55am GMT 10.46am GMT Australia to introduce a ban on all overseas travel This is a significant escalation. Scott Morrison says the travel advice from Dfat will be escalated from a “do not travel” warning to a ban on all overseas travel, except in exceptional circumstances. Exceptions will include people providing aid work in the Pacific, compassionate travel and essential travel for employment. Morrison says the ban has been introduced because “there are people defying that advice and looking to go overseas on leisure travel”. He says the Australian government will also introduce new offences for people profiteering from bringing essential medical supplies into the country. Updated at 10.51am GMT 10.42am GMT On school closures, Scott Morrison says the medical advice has not changed. That is, it’s still safe to send your kids to school. Morrison is meeting with the education minister, Dan Tehan, and the national education unions to ensure that schools remain open and that teachers can be protected. I said this the other day: This is incredibly important. It’s going to be a tough year in 2020 and one of the things I don’t want to have yielded up is a year of a child’s education, which is so important. We need to work so hard together to try and ensure that those kids get that education and that is not lost to this virus. Morrison says all schools around the country will reopen after the Easter holidays, but it will be a mixture of in-person and distance learning. He says schools will remain open for “essential workers” and, under his definition, every worker is essential. Everyone who has a job in this economy is an essential worker. Every single job that is being done in our economy with these severe restrictions that are taking place is essential. It can be an essential service whether it’s a nurse or a doctor or a schoolteacher, or a public servant who is working tonight to ensure that we can get even greater capacity in our Centrelink offices, working until 8pm under the new arrangement in the call centres, these are all essential jobs. People stacking shelves, that is essential. People earning money in their family when another member of their family may have lost their job and can no longer earn, that’s an essential job. Jobs are essential. And everyone who has one needs to be able to keep doing their job, and that means they will need to continue to be able to send their children to school for an education. Updated at 10.48am GMT 10.36am GMT Scott Morrison: You should only go outside your home to go to those essential things I talked about, not to go and congregate in groups. We need you to stop doing that. That is not going to help. If we do all these things then we are going to be able to put greater pressure on slowing the rate of the spread of this virus, which in particular in New South Wales and Victoria has been growing at a much more rapid rate than other places. Updated at 10.38am GMT 10.35am GMT All of these bans will come into force from midnight tomorrow. Scott Morrison says he wants Australians to show common sense in engaging in social distancing, and “to stay at home unless it is absolutely necessary you go out”. Going out for the basics, going out for an exercise, perhaps with your partner or family members, provided it’s a small group, that’s fine. But going outside and going out and participating more broadly in the community, unless you’re shopping for basics or there are medical needs or you’re providing care and support to an individual at another place. Going to work and where you cannot work from home. That is encouraged, strongly encouraged to work from home where you can do that. Visits to your premises, to your house, to your residence, should be kept to a minimum and with very small numbers of guests. We don’t want to be overly specific about that, we want Australians to exercise their common sense. The PM says states and territories may look at introducing specific offences for people who hold house parties. He says people will also be told not to gather in groups in public. Updated at 10.37am GMT 10.32am GMT Funerals of more than 10 mourners banned, weddings restricted to five people Scott Morrison says funerals of more than 10 mourners will now be banned. He says he knows this will be “very difficult”. Weddings will be restricted to just five people – the couple, the celebrant and two witnesses. These are the same rules that were introduced in the UK recently. Morrison says he knows this will be a particularly difficult change for people. Updated at 10.35am GMT 10.27am GMT Bans on indoor gatherings extended Scott Morrison says the national cabinet has agreed to extend the restrictions on indoor gatherings, announced on Sunday, to include a range of new closures. They include auction houses, food courts in shopping centres and some markets, although the markets will be decided by state and territory governments. There are also bans on beauty services, tanning services, tattoo parlours, waxing salons and nail salons. Hairdressers and barbers can continue to operate provided each client is in and out in 30 minutes. Updated at 10.32am GMT 10.24am GMT Scott Morrison says the national cabinet as well as the federal and state and territory governments “have considered the many many difficult issues that we are having to address”. We are not unconscious of the real impact these measures are having on the lives of daily Australians so we will continue to do everything we can, both as a federal government and at state government and territory governments around the country, to do all we can to support our people through what is going to be an incredibly difficult time. Morrison says the government “will work night and day to ensure that we can get more capacity into [Centrelink] systems. But what this reflects is the size of the need.” Updated at 10.28am GMT 10.21am GMT The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is talking now. Updated at 10.24am GMT 10.13am GMT While we wait for Scott Morrison, this is what the advertising expert Dee Madigan had to say about the Australian government’s communication campaign so far: I understand the government doesn’t want to panic people, but in the face of so much mixed messaging people have been confused. Now it’s at the point they need to scare the fuck out of people to get the message across. You can read more of what experts are saying on the need for clearer messaging and a clearer rationale on Australia’s coronavirus strategy, here: Related: Australia is crying out for clearer messaging on coronavirus, 'rambling' politicians told Updated at 10.25am GMT 10.02am GMT We have just been told that Scott Morrison will give a press conference at 9.20pm. As Amy Remeikes reported earlier, the national cabinet tonight was discussing possible stage two social distancing measures. Stage one was the closure of cafes, gyms and places of worship announced on Sunday. We know that experts asked to provided advice to the chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, recommended much stronger social distancing measures and said localised measures, shutting down particular suburbs as Morrison suggested earlier in the week, wouldn’t work as well as tough national rules. The national cabinet was also discussing the ability of the health system to respond to a projected increase in cases. Those Group of Eight experts suggested the number of cases in Australia could reach 50,000 by Easter. Updated at 10.07am GMT 9.40am GMT Not now, Northern Territory politics. The Assembly has conducted a secret ballot pursuant to a motion moved by the Member for Spillet. The result is the Member for Spillet is to be recognised as the Official Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly. 5 votes to 3 — Legislative Assembly (@LegAssemblyNT) March 24, 2020 9.34am GMT We are expecting to hear from the prime minister, Scott Morrison, shortly, with an update on what was decided at the national cabinet meeting tonight. Updated at 9.40am GMT 9.29am GMT The Greens senator Rachel Siewert says she worked with the federal government to ensure mutual obligation requirements were suspended. Siewert says: I have been working with the minister to get this fixed. I’m very pleased that mutual obligations have been suspended until at least 31 March. She said it was “incredibly stressful” for people who are reliant on welfare to try to meet those fortnightly reporting requirements at a time when queues for Centrelink are several blocks long, and 3.2 million people have accessed the MyGov website in 20 hours. If welfare recipients did not meet their reporting requirements, they risked having payments suspended. Updated at 9.31am GMT 9.13am GMT Universities warn Australia could see more than 50,000 cases by Easter The Group of Eight universities have written to the health minister, Greg Hunt, with new advice on social distancing requested by the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy. Perhaps the most concerning observation from the experts is that: As government is aware, the doubling time is approximately every 1.6 days in Australia, compared to 6 days in February. The reduction in doubling time is an indicator that the window for proactive intervention is very small. At this current rate Australia could theoretically expect over 6,000 cases by the end of next week and over 50,000 cases by Easter. The experts say they “support the stronger decisions being now taken by government and what we term as the ‘go now, go hard and go smart’ strategy”. But their recommendations go much further: Australia without delay implements national stronger social distancing measures, more extensive banning of mass gatherings, school closure or class dismissal. Australia urgently seeks mechanisms to enable a much-enhanced and coordinated regime of Covid-19 testing without delay. This should include community testing to estimate the rates of disease in the population and this should guide further decision making. Strengthen the messaging around the importance of people complying with all of the requirements of isolation or quarantine and having increased compliance monitoring and support to allow them to do so. Social distancing, especially when introduced vigorously across so many areas of life, will have significant costs for individuals and groups in society. These consequences will impact unequally. Governments should plan for this and ensure flexible and supportive policy responses for all who may be disadvantaged. The experts warned that an estimated 20% to 30% of the population “will not comply” with social distancing rules. As national cabinet meets to discuss stronger measures (or “stage 2 measures”), the Group of Eight experts warned that “interventions need to be comprehensive and simultaneous to have the most impact and a slow trickle of interventions, or suburb-by-suburb lockdowns likely will not be adequate”. Updated at 9.20am GMT 9.11am GMT Centrelink mutual obligations lifted The Australian government has lifted the mutual obligation requirements for welfare recipients, meaning people will not have their payments suspended if they are unable to meet fortnightly reporting requirements. The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, and the social services minister, Anne Ruston, released this joint statement a short time ago: The Coronavirus has, and will continue to have, a devastating impact on Australian jobs and businesses. Due to the high demand on government services, jobseekers have experienced difficulty with reporting their mutual obligations. During this challenging time, the Morrison Government is lifting all mutual obligation requirements for jobseekers until capacity can be restored to the MyGov website. Requirements will be lifted until 31 March, 2020, however if congestion continues, the Government will consider extending these arrangements. What this means is that no one will be penalised for not being able to report their attendance at appointments or activities – no one’s payments will be suspended and no compliance action will be taken. The Morrison Government remains committed to mutual obligations and their success with jobseekers and believes in the importance of Australians continued connection to the workforce during this difficult time. Updated at 9.14am GMT 8.59am GMT Queensland reports 78 new cases of Covid-19, bringing state total to 397 Figures just released by the Queensland health department show the state recorded 78 new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number to 397. The majority of cases are still from patients who have travelled overseas or had direct contact with a known case, Queensland Health said. The majority of cases to date – 208 – are in the Brisbane region. Another 79 are on the Gold Coast and 46 were recorded on the Sunshine Coast. Updated at 9.07am GMT 8.49am GMT Scenes from the new border checkpoint in Eucla, Western Australia. WA police have released this footage of border checks at Eucla on the Eyre Highway this afternoon.

As of 3pm today, according to the Australian health department, there are 2,136 confirmed coronavirus cases in Australia. That’s 427 new cases in the past 24 hours. These figures are already out of date. Updated at 8.42am GMT 8.11am GMT 3.2 million people logged into MyGov, says Stuart Robert The government services minister, Stuart Robert, says 3.2 million people have logged in to MyGov in the past 20 hours. He says new Centrelink call staff are being trained urgently, with some to start tomorrow. Robert made the comments on Twitter, in what seems to be his first statement after that interview with Alan Jones this morning where he admitted the government had been inadequately prepared for the high demand for unemployment services caused by coronavirus shutdown measures. He said: There is unprecedented demand for Centrelink services right now. We know that. We are doing everything we can to increase capacity for myGov and our call centres. The scale of this challenge is immense and it will take some time to get everyone into our systems but please be assured support is here for you and your family. We have facilitated 3.2 million logins to myGov over the past 20 hours. This is just extraordinary demand. We will continue to run this service 24/7 and progressively increase its capacity as we have over recent days & months. — Stuart Robert MP (@stuartrobertmp) March 24, 2020 Yes, there are significant delays on our phone lines as well. We have trained large numbers of staff and are rapidly training more people to work on these phone lines – even as soon as tomorrow. Again, we need everyone to be patient so we can help you – we aren’t going anywhere and will here through this difficult time. Payments will be available and Centrelink staff are working as hard as they can. If you missed the minister’s comments on 2GB earlier today, he said: Again my bad not realising the sheer scale of the decision on Sunday night by national leaders that literally saw hundreds of thousands, maybe a million, people unemployed overnight. Let me heartily recommend political editor Katharine Murphy’s view on that interview, for your reading pleasure: Related: Stuart Robert’s incompetence on MyGov should accelerate his own social isolation | Katharine Murphy Updated at 8.32am GMT 7.58am GMT A second student of the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) has tested positive for Covid-19. In a statement, UTS said the student attended its Sydney campus on Wednesday 11 March and Thursday 12 March. They received their positive test result last night. UTS said both students who have tested positive to Covid-19 are second-year students in the faculty of health, but “there is no evidence they are linked”. It said all the classrooms the student attended have received a “deep clean” and UTS was now delivering most teaching online, with most staff allowed to work remotely. 7.40am GMT 2020, what a horrible year. Tomorrow would’ve been the opening night of the 2020 Melbourne Comedy Festival.

We will bring you any updates from this meeting as soon as they become available. Updated at 7.32am GMT 7.26am GMT There is already talk of a potential class action for passengers of the Ruby Princess cruise ship. As of today, 133 passengers from that ship have tested positive to Covid-19 and one person has sadly died. Shine Lawyers says it has been contacted by passengers from the ship and is “investigating multiple avenues to compensate distressed and disappointed passengers who contracted Covid-19 as a result of this alleged negligence”. In the meantime: do not go on a cruise. If you have been on a cruise in the last 14 days, even if it’s not the Ruby Princess, stay home for 14 days and monitor your health for possible symptoms of Covid-19. Updated at 7.32am GMT 7.19am GMT Commercial charter flights to rescue Australians stranded in locked down Peru and Argentina are slated to fly Friday, but airlines are still waiting on final approval from those South American governments in order to fly. Hundreds of Australians remained stranded in both countries, and, even if those flights are able to repatriate some citizens, others, in more remote parts of those countries, will be unable to get to airports to be evacuated. For others, the cost of the repatriation flights — more than $5000 for an economy class seat — is too great. Foreign affairs minister Marise Payne has said the Australian government understood that tightening lockdowns and closed borders was making it hard for many to get home. She said: To those who are seeing border closures and flight disruptions, our diplomatic and consular personnel are talking to host governments, airlines, travel companies, so that we can help you in finding transport options. We continue to urge you, if you want to come home, to do so as soon as possible via commercial means. Shadow foreign affairs minister Penny Wong said the Australian government needed to follow the lead of other countries, and send planes to rescue its citizens. Qantas and Virgin are set to cease international flights on March 30, Wong said. Wong: Closing borders and airports, changing travel warnings, and cancelled flights are leaving many Australians with no commercial travel options. It’s not just countries like Peru that are in lockdown; major hubs like Singapore have banned transit altogether by non-citizens. Australians overseas and their families are deeply worried for their safety and welfare. Scott Morrison must act now, while the airlines are still operating, to address this problem. 7.08am GMT The Queensland government has issued a fact sheet for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples on how to conduct funerals and sorry business during the coronavirus crisis. It reads: We know sorry business and other cultural reasons for large gatherings in communities are very important, but it is important to understand that it will put Elders and others who are already ill at serious risk if you don’t observe health advice.

It is good to clear this up – I have seen some concern and confusion from the transport and agricultural industries this week. McCormack says that “freight movements around the nation will continue across state borders as it did before this crisis began”. There is no need to worry about essential supplies of food, medicine, or other goods because freight is an essential service. As our way of life is fundamentally disrupted, I want to reassure Australians that freight movements around the country will continue throughout the #COVID19AU pandemic. Food supplies, medicine & other goods will reach their destination, because freight is an essential service. pic.twitter.com/aDKUazymwd — Michael McCormack (@M_McCormackMP) March 24, 2020 Updated at 7.05am GMT 6.56am GMT Meanwhile, Labor’s government services shadow minister, Bill Shorten, has issued a list of suggestions that the opposition believes could help solve the ongoing problems with Centrelink. They include having Centrelink staff speaking with people in queues to “start triaging”, distributing a one page form to people in queues to give them a customer reference number (CRN), separate hotlines for new Centrelink customers, and a “callback” function so people do not need to stay on hold indefinitely. Shorten said: These are our suggestions made in good faith. If the government has better ideas we are open to them. But there should be no more excuses, only solutions. Shorten also said the government should rehire about 4,000 experienced staff cut in recent years. The government said Sunday it was hiring up to 5,000 new staff. It has also promised streamlined Centrelink application processes and pledged to increase the capacity of the MyGov website to avoid further crashes. Updated at 7.17am GMT 6.51am GMT Welfare recipients should not be penalised for reporting requirements When you look at all the images of the newly unemployed gathered outside Centrelink offices and read the accounts of their struggles with myGov website, spare a thought for those already receiving welfare benefits and who also need those services. Many of them will have needed to report their circumstances to Centrelink. It’s a fortnightly obligation and failing to do so usually triggers and automatic payment suspension. The way to fix that (and ensure you get your payment on time) is, yes, you guessed it – to contact Centrelink. “The government has a moral obligation to guarantee that people already on Centrelink will not get their payment suspended if they can’t report online or complete mutual obligations while Centrelink is experiencing this unprecedented surge in people needing its services,” the Greens senator Rachel Siewert said today. The government has so far declined to fully suspend mutual obligations or promise that no payments will be suspended during the crisis. “This is why I have been calling and continue to call for the minister to suspend all mutual obligations, the system is not set up to handle a health and economic crisis like this,” Siewert said. The Guardian has contacted the government services minister, Stuart Robert, for comment. Updated at 7.07am GMT 6.46am GMT Roger Cook says that healthcare workers in WA who record a temperature of more than 38C and have “influenza-like illness” will also be tested at Covid-19 clinics. He said the state would move to an “aggressive outreach program” to target high-risk communities. Cook said: We will now be targeting geographically localised areas where we’ve become aware there’s community transmission. We’re will also be testing people in other settings where we identified localised outbreaks. So you can understand if we have a localised outbreak in a particular community that will then lead to a heightened awareness around the public health units in that community and start testing a wider group. The new testing regime also includes anyone who has disembarked a cruise ship in the past 14 days, even if that ship has not been in international waters. Cook said they would also conduct testing in areas where there had been examples of respiratory illness occurring among vulnerable or close-quartered populations, even if there was no confirmed community transmission of coronavirus in those areas. That includes aged and residential care settings, remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, detention centres or prisons, boarding schools, military barracks or equivalent. If we see respiratory illness in those cases, two or more, we’ll undertake testing then. Five of the new cases reported on Tuesday are in regional areas: two in the Kimberley, one in the mid west, one in the wheatbelt and one in the great southern. Updated at 7.08am GMT 6.39am GMT Western Australia reports 35 new cases, and announces new testing regime The Western Australian health minister, Roger Cook, says that WA has recorded 35 new cases of Covid-19 in the past day, bringing the total number of cases to 175. Two of the new cases are young children, aged four and 10. Those children are members of the same family and contracted the virus from a known contract. Cook says: Of these new cases, eight are passengers of the Ruby Princess. And four are from the Ovation Of The Seas. The cruise ships that were docked in Sydney Harbour. Now you see just what an impact those two cruise ships have had nationally. He says more than 10,500 people have been tested to date and WA would expand its testing regime to “scan the horizon” for new outbreaks. The testing regime that we will now be pursuing essentially has three aims. One is that we want to protect the vulnerable. Two, we want to pick up individual cases and to be able to scan the horizon to see them easily. And, three, we want to increase our awareness of any community transmission as that starts to take place. However he said the Covid-19 clinics would remain focused on overseas travellers and confirmed contacts. Updated at 7.09am GMT 6.33am GMT In Western Australia, the state government has reportedly converted its $1.6bn Optus Stadium into a coronavirus crisis management centre. Former WA premier Colin Barnett was pretty heavily criticised for investing a big chunk of the surplus from the mining boom into this stadium, but perhaps he knew all along that it would be useful as a staging area in the event of a pandemic that caused the shut down of all the sport for which it was built. But probably not. According to New.com.au, the premier Mark McGowan said the stadium would primarily be used by police as a staging point for “maintaining law and order”. McGowan told reporters: They will turn the directions that come out of the state emergency committee meetings, which happens at least twice a week, into operational guidance for officers. It is one of four crisis management centres being established in WA. 6.27am GMT The New South Wales parliament has passed an amendment to its Long Service Leave Act to allow public sector workers to take their long service leave entitlements early, if their employer agrees. NSW treasurer Dom Perrottet said it will “help support families during this difficult time”. I'm pleased to say Parliament today passed an amendment to the Long Service Leave Act allowing workers who wish to access LSL early to do so, with mutual agreement from their employer. This will help to support families during this difficult time. #nswpol #auspol @business_nsw — Dom Perrottet (@Dom_Perrottet) March 24, 2020 6.22am GMT SBS News will be broadcast from Canberra tonight because an employee based in its Sydney newsroom has tested positive to Covid-19, executive editor Sally Roberts said.

In a statement released this afternoon the chair of the NSW Education Standards Authority, Prof Peter Shergold, said the state’s higher school certificate would still go ahead, with individual principals to be given discretion over the number and weighting of assessments. He also said any student who became sick would not be disadvantaged as a result. Shergold sought to reassure students who have this week been told they should no longer attend classes unless they need to be there. We know you are worried. While we recognise we are facing an unprecedented situation, we want to assure you that you will be able to get a HSC certificate this year, and that the certificate will facilitate access to university, further education and employment, as it has for students over the past 50 years. Keep learning, do your assessments as advised by your school, make progress on your major projects where you can and, most importantly, look after yourself, whether you are at school or at home. Reach out to family, friends and your teachers if you need to. If you get sick, your school and NESA have provisions to ensure you are not disadvantaged. He said the NESA board was still working on a solution for students who would usually do vocational work placements or performances as part of their HSC. The board discussed at length issues of disadvantage, dislocation and social isolation. Decisions and advice will be based on the principles of fairness and equity that have always underpinned the internationally recognised HSC credential.

Updated at 6.26am GMT 6.14am GMT South Australia has its first case of community transmission South Australia had another 36 people diagnosed with Covid-19, bringing its total to 170 cases. That includes its first case of community transmission. This is a woman in her 50s. She has had recent contact with people from overseas. But the information I have been given to date is that these people did not have symptoms when she was in contact with them. Which is obviously concerning. However, the rest of our confirmed cases, to this day, have either had overseas or interstate travel or they have had contact with a confirmed case. 6.11am GMT Today so far NSW records its seventh death, a woman in her 70s, who was a passenger on the Ruby Diamond cruise ship. That brings the nation’s total fatalities to eight. Queensland will close its borders from tomorrow, with permits needed for those who regularly cross the Tweed. Queensland has also announced a $4bn rescue package for business and displaced workers. WA has closed its borders and restricted travel within the state. Tasmania has said it will turn away all non-residents and non-essential travellers on the Spirit of Tasmania.

He’ll have more information on that for you soon. 6.02am GMT Amnesty International wants state and territory governments to release children who are on remand and are detained in adult watch houses. “We’re talking about kids as young as 10 in adult prisons,” Amnesty International Australia’s Indigenous rights lead, Lidia Thorpe, said. “Most of these kids are later released without conviction, only underlining that it’s totally unacceptable to leave them in prison when they would be safer at home with their family. Thorpe said under the convention on the rights of the child, detention of a child before trial or after sentencing must be used only as a measure of last resort, for the shortest time possible, and separate from detained adults wherever possible. “Given that the spread of Covid-19 is a particular public health concern in custodial environments, the authorities should urgently release these children and seriously consider the same for other groups at special risks,” Amnesty said. Earlier today the NSW government announced new emergency powers aimed at keeping the justice system functional, including giving the corrections minister power to early release or parole certain prisoners on a case-by-case basis.

At Booderee national park, camping will be cancelled until 1 May 2020, and no forward bookings taken until there is greater clarity on longer-term arrangements. Existing bookings will be refunded. Parks Australia will continue to facilitate access to Booderee, Kakadu and Uluru-Kata Tjuta national parks for residents of the parks and surrounding Aboriginal communities, essential services, and those working in the community.

Jo-anne Schofield, the national president of United Workers Union says: “As the Fair Work Commission full bench hears this application, there are close to a million hospitality workers across the country facing cuts to their hours, being stood down, or losing their jobs. “Our hospitality members want job security and certainty above all else and we hope this variation will help to deliver this. “Altering the award temporarily is an important step to help protect workers and their shifts during this unprecedented time. “We have moved quickly to ensure the temporary changes provides a measured response that supports equity so that as many workers as possible can access hours of work.” Schofield said penalty rates, allowances and job security would all be preserved under the proposal. Updated at 5.44am GMT 5.32am GMT Qantas has responded to Virgin Australia (and the ACCC) regarding this story from Ben Butler and Josh Taylor: Related: Rod Sims weighs in on Virgin Australia stoush with Qantas, calling for 'cooperative spirit' It’s a tough time for everyone in aviation, which is why we said that any assistance should be to be industry-wide and proportional. We don’t think that’s controversial or anti-competitive, and it’s exactly what the government has done with its aviation support package. In the past fortnight, Virgin has made legal threats to us directly and has now gone to the ACCC to claim we’re the source of various rumours circulating widely in the market. We’re not. What is true is that we’ve been very candid in our assessment of what’s happening to airlines around the world and the fact we’re determined to be different. Saying you want to survive is not anti-competitive. 5.29am GMT Telstra confirms phone network struggling with volumes of calls to government call centres This would explain the terrible reception most of us have had all day.

Average student absences across public schools in New South Wales increased from 40% yesterday to 74% today, after premier Gladys Berejiklian said parents should keep children at home if they can. — Michael McGowan (@mmcgowan) March 24, 2020 Updated at 5.20am GMT 5.18am GMT The Australian sharemarket closed up 4.2% on Tuesday, almost clawing back losses from Monday. Despite the solid performance, the market is still more than a third down from where it was a month ago, before it was gripped by a coronavirus-inspired selling frenzy. And several big companies that are most affected by the pandemic are suspended from trade, meaning they cannot weigh down the benchmark ASX 200 index. Graincorp shed more than 50%, but its drop was not coronavirus-related – today was the first day of trade for its malting arm, which it has spun off into a separate company. Consumer-exposed financial stocks that were smashed on Monday bounced back, with debt collector Credit Corp ballooning 46% and buy-now-pay-later operator Afterpay skyrocketing 26%. Travel agent Corporate Travel, which has been smashed by the virus and is also a perennial short-seller target, soared 31%. Updated at 5.21am GMT 5.14am GMT The mayor of the Tweed shire council says the closure of the New South Wales-Queensland border will cause traffic chaos in both states and potentially create long delays for thousands of essential service workers. Katie Milne told Guardian Australia her council had not been consulted about the Queensland government’s border plan and remained “very much in the dark” about how it would be enforced. “We’ve got 8,000 Tweed residents who work on the Gold Coast (and) we’re very worried about how that is going to be managed,” Milne said. “There are 5,000 Gold Coast residents who work in the Tweed. There are a lot of friends and family who live on either side, the communities are very intertwined. “We don’t know what will happen to people who rely on buses, whether they will be made to get off and show they have legitimate reasons for travelling. “There’s a lot of questions and we would have really loved to have been consulted. I do appreciate the [Queensland] premier’s intent, and I understand where she’s coming from but the practicalities are extremely difficult.” The closure of Queensland borders will be logistically more difficult than in other states, where there are main highway routes in and out. Suburban areas of Tweed Heads and Coolangatta blend together and in some places border crossings are not signposted. Milne had been calling for a coordinated national lockdown, that would have itself prevented the sorts of long-haul movements that the Queensland border closure is attempting to stop, without causing localised disruption. “Our main concern is looking after our doctors and nurses and medical staff and making sure they are not overwhelmed and they can get to work. We now have a bit of an understanding about how they will manage the freeway (but) still don’t really know what is going to happen on local roads. “We don’t know who is going to manage that traffic congestion and whether we are supposed to have our workers out there in hazmat suits to cop the abuse. One hundred and thirty council staff live in the Gold Coast.” Updated at 5.27am GMT 5.13am GMT Netflix has agreed to the governments request to wind back its streaming configurations to help lower the impact on the nbn: Comms minister Paul Fletcher writes to Netflix, Stan and gaming companies asking them to reduce data to avoid broadband overload during coronavirus pandemic https://t.co/dAmTFKnqxa — Josh Taylor (@joshgnosis) March 20, 2020 Paul Fletcher: “I welcome Netflix’s proactive decision to temporarily dial back its streaming configurations to lessen demands on Australia’s broadband network, at a time when more and more Australians are relying on residential broadband for their connectivity and productivity. “NBN is accommodating increases in peak hour traffic, and there is substantial headroom for retail service providers to meet further demands. The measures taken by Netflix are sensible and helpful in anticipation of greater traffic and data use on residential broadband in the near-term. At the same time, there is unlikely to be a noticeable change for viewers. “Last week I held discussions with the telecommunications industry about planning and preparedness for increased numbers of people working from home, and I wrote to video streaming and gaming platforms asking them to consider actions they could take to optimise broadband conditions for all Australians as they respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. “I have every expectation that other over-the-top providers will adopt similarly helpful measures in the community’s interest over this period.” 5.09am GMT The National Farmers Federation wants governments to guarantee that the border closures happening across the country (except Victoria and NSW) will not stop the agricultural supply chain: Governments must assure all Australians that the agricultural supply chain will not be disrupted by state and territory border closures and mandatory quarantine periods, the National Farmers’ Federation has reiterated today. “Protecting human health is the most important priority and the requirement for state border closures and mandatory quarantine is understood,” NFF CEO Tony Mahar said. “However, we are calling on Governments to immediately formally implement and communicate nationally consistent, straight-forward exemptions for farmers and transport operators, so Australians’ access to fresh produce can continue to be guaranteed. “Getting produce from paddock to plate is a complex process that often spans multiple state and territory jurisdictions. “Whether it’s moving fruit from north Queensland to New South Wales, or livestock from selling centres in Victoria to processors in South Australia, freedom of movement is critical. “Logistics that deliver inputs such as fodder, fertiliser and packaging to farms, meat processors and packing facilities are also fundamental. “Right now, the last thing the people who are doing the important job of producing, processing and delivering every-day essentials need is inconsistency across states and territories and a mountain of cumbersome paperwork.” 5.08am GMT [Cont from previous post] Last week, Solomon Lew’s retail empire said the coronavirus pandemic had slashed customer traffic in its Smiggle stationery stores around the world. Lew, who has been complaining about high rents for years, said Premier closed two Hong Kong stores due to Covid-19 “and we are prepared to close many more stores globally if landlords do not respond to the current crisis”. Others have put on a brave face – on Monday, JB Hi-Fi said it was doing well, pointing out that it sold things people need to respond to the crisis, including home office equipment. But despite the brave talk, it withdrew its profit forecasts anyway. Bizarrely enough, Myer, which has long been struggling, hasn’t updated the market for more than a week. Its main rival, David Jones, is no longer listed on the exchange after being taken over by South African group Woolworths. But Woolworths is listed, on the Johannesburg exchange. Last month it said sales at DJs and womenswear chain Country Road, which it also owns, were already down in the usually lucrative pre-Christmas period due to the bushfires and Country Road pulling its stock out of Myer. Updated at 6.04am GMT 5.07am GMT With the market relatively quiet today, it’s a good time to have a look at what’s going on in the retail sector – and what’s going to happen. A walk down your local shopping strip will show you that some retailers have already pulled the plug rather than try to tough it out any further in a sector that’s already been smashed by years of persistently low consumer confidence, which means households are reluctant to spend. The hospitality and entertainment sectors have already been almost completely shut down, tipping huge numbers of people into the dole queues we’ve seen stretching around the block over the past two days. Non-essential retail is also getting hammered and is in line to be shut down next – remember, the Victorian and NSW governments announced just that on Sunday afternoon, before abandoning the plan later that evening at national cabinet. Shopping centre owners have already lost their foodcourts and analysts say they are likely to have to give up trying to collect rent from at least some tenants – a big turnaround from their usual habit of regularly hiking rents. Analysts at Macquarie forecast this will cut shopping centre rents in half for at least three months. Macquarie analysts and their rivals at UBS both think most shopping centre operators have enough money in the bank to absorb the pain. But their tenants are in a lot more trouble. Today, Retail Food Group, which is the franchiser of a raft of foodcourt favourites including Gloria Jean’s, Brumby’s, Donut King, Michel’s Patisserie, Pizza Capers and Crust Pizza, withdrew its profit forecasts. “A reduced customer count amongst RFG’s domestic franchise network, as a consequence of the increasingly onerous restrictions made in a series of announcements by the government since last week, is anticipated by the company (and supported by recent trading data referable to that period),” it told the ASX. “The trend will likely be more pronounced, in the company’s view, amongst outlets operating within shopping centres.” Updated at 6.06am GMT 5.00am GMT AAP has more on what the border shutdown will mean for residents who live in the Tweed (right next to the Queensland border with Coolangatta): Thousands of people living in northern NSW will have to apply for permits to travel into Queensland from Wednesday in a desperate bid to stop the spread of Covid-19. Residents living in the Tweed and in the New England areas will face a border policed in an RBT-style with officers to determine who needs to cross. While still in the planning stages, police said residents could be issued with stickers to place on their cars to ensure travel is “as seamless as possible”, deputy commissioner Steve Gollschewski told reporters. “We acknowledge this inconvenience may be quite challenging for some people, but we appeal to them to comply with our directions to help manage the impact of Covid-19 on our community,” he said. “You will see police officers and other officials, government officials, out on the road as of one minute past midnight tomorrow night, making sure that these measures work. “If any person is allowed to come into Queensland, they have to recognise that if they don’t have these reasons to come in, an essential purpose, they will be required to do 14 days self-quarantine regardless of whether they are symptomatic or not.” Anyone travelling by road, air, sea and rail for non-essential purposes will essentially be cut off Travelling to work, to the supermarket, the pharmacy and the petrol station is classed as essential. Updated at 6.06am GMT 4.43am GMT New South Wales and Victoria are now the only jurisdictions without additional movement restrictions. 4.28am GMT WA to restrict movement between regions Mark McGowan says if drivers reach the WA border by 1.30pm WA time – including waiting in your car in the queue, you won’t have to undergo the new restrictions (which includes 14 days of forced quarantine) The WA premier also says he will be moving to keep WA residents at home – with restrictions between regions to be cracked down upon. Our new border restrictions have helped put a complete stop, a major restriction or stop on any unnecessary travel into the state. I also want to expand that advice across Western Australia. That means that any unnecessary intrastate, internal travel in Western Australia, needs to be avoided. We’ll be putting in place restrictions on the movement between Western Australia’s regions. It is important we minimise the spread of this virus. Clear guidelines around this will be released soon. Essential travel cannot be avoided. That is understandable. But we need to avoid everything else. I’m asking West Australians for their understanding during this very, very difficult time. This measure we’re putting in place in the future will protect our regional citizens, especially the elderly, and especially Aboriginal people. If people don’t stay away from the beaches, McGowan says the state will also shut down all beaches. Updated at 4.30am GMT 4.22am GMT [continued from previous post] Police are being provided with daily lists of people who are supposed to be in isolation by authorities like the health department and Australian Border Force. Nugent said they were concerned that mandatory isolation could lead to an increase in family violence, and police had been told to be alert to those signs when they conduct self-isolation checks. At the moment those checks are occuring in person, but they may soon move to video calls. Police are also patrolling public areas in Victoria on the lookout for mass gatherings, and going to shopping centres to ensure there is no squabbling over toilet paper. Australians have also been dobbing in their neighbours; Nugent said they had received “tens” of calls a day reporting suspected breaches. Asked if he was upset such a “draconian” response was required to ensure people followed public health rules, Nugent said: “We have seen internationally what’s going on with this virus and we are seeing nationally the spread, the rate of spread, and we need to be doing all we can to limit that spread. If police have to play a stronger role, and it’s a role we have not had to do before, then that’s our role. Because our role is about helping people in need of assistance. It is our role, it’s in the act.” Updated at 4.25am GMT 4.21am GMT Police in Victoria will be conducting spot checks on people who are supposed to be undergoing mandatory self-isolation to make sure they are complying with the rules, deputy commissioner Rick Nugent said. At a press conference in Melbourne earlier, Nugent said the checks had been going on for a few weeks and not everyone had been remaining indoors, as directed. A statewide police operation, Operation Sentinel, is being stood up this week, and 500 police will be out every day specifically monitoring coronavirus provisions. Nugent said: “Unfortunately there are people who are not taking these restrictions seriously. What we are finding in doing these spot checks is that people are not actually staying home and quarantining themselves. They have been visiting the movies, going out for breakfast or other meals. This is just putting too many people at risk. “People who ignore the restrictions are placing others at significant risk of catching the virus, and people will become infected … It’s actually quite selfish and we know it will put lives at risk.” To date, no one has been fined. The fines in Victoria are $20,000 for individuals or $100,000 for corporations – the same fines apply to those who breach mass gathering rules. Nugent said that those who had breached the mandatory self-isolation requirements had done so out of “a degree of ignorance”. People had said they had stayed at home for the most part, but just popped out for breakfast when they needed “a break”. “When you have explained that they can’t do it at all they have been quite apologetic,” Nugent said. He said “we don’t want to have a big stick approach to this” but would fine when there was a “blatant, selfish disregard” for the public health guidelines. Updated at 4.23am GMT 4.18am GMT Jacinda Ardern says she has asked the Australian government to allow New Zealanders to access welfare benefits during the coronavirus crisis. She told a press conference today: I have raised this issue with Prime Minister Morrison. I have specifically sought, ‘Could we have a short-term exemption?’ Just for these exceptional circumstances for New Zealanders to be supported. Not least because it will encourage compliance at a time when we need everyone to be self isolating if they have to for instance.” Ardern said both she and the deputy prime minister, Winston Peters, had asked for the exemption with their counterparts. Most New Zealanders are banned from accessing welfare benefits and other social programs such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme under immigration laws brought in by the Howard government. Updated at 4.21am GMT 4.12am GMT Another 78 cases of Covid-19 in Queensland There have been 78 new cases of Covid-19 in Queensland overnight. That brings the state’s total to 397.

Jason Clare, Bill Shorten and Linda Burney think this should be included: The package, to be discussed tonight should consider: Eviction moratorium – preventing landlords commencing eviction proceedings for a failure to pay rent as a result of financial hardship caused by the virus. Payment flexibility – allowing rents to be paid over time. This could be a smart way to transfer the mortgage flexibility given to landlords by banks, to the tenants who live in these dwellings. Utility payment holidays – extended, and penalty free, periods to pay the phone, the gas, the internet, and the power bills, without fear the service will be cut off. Last week the UK and US governments announced measures to protect mortgage-holders from foreclosure and tenants from eviction. We should do the same. UK landlords will not be able to start proceedings to evict tenants for at least a three-month period. The states have had a number of days now to consider the most impactful measures and create a comprehensive and workable package. We urge governments to act immediately tonight. Updated at 3.58am GMT 3.52am GMT Palm Island is also shutting itself off from non-residents and non-essential visitors: The Palm Island Local Disaster Management Group (LDMG) has approved travel restrictions to the community after the Queensland premier’s state disaster declaration on Sunday. “From midnight on Wednesday [25 March] night, travel to Palm Island will be restricted,” LDMG interim-chair deputy mayor Roy Prior said. “That means only people involved in the provision of essential services in the community, and people undertaking essential medical travel as provided by Queensland Health, will be allowed here. “We recognise many members of our community may be vulnerable to coronavirus, therefore these measures are necessary to try and ensure the ongoing health, wellbeing and safety of all our residents in these challenging times. “It is understood some of these difficult decisions are contrary to our culture, however the concerns surrounding coronavirus and the possible impact on our community are really important at this time.” For more information see the council’s website at www.palmcouncil.qld.gov.au Updated at 3.56am GMT 3.51am GMT Western Australia is shutting its border very, very soon (1.30pm WA time) There are long queues at the WA/SA border as people rush to get back into WA before border restrictions come into force at 1.30pm @westaustralian pic.twitter.com/YxqTQN8WhW — angelapownall (@angelapownall) March 24, 2020 3.44am GMT More on who is allowed in – or not – in Queensland Important information about Queensland border restrictions: https://t.co/jJRc4qCMD6 Measures take effect from midnight Wednesday. #Queensland #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/2hMVPzaNLh — Annastacia Palaszczuk (@AnnastaciaMP) March 24, 2020 It remains the greatest nation on earth, even if it has locked me out. 3.42am GMT More than 300 Australians are stranded across Peru, which has closed its borders and enforced a nationwide curfew, enforced by the military and police.

Australia’s ambassador to Ecuador and Bolivia Diana Nelson posted a video message from Lima, assuring citizens the government was seeking ways to get its citizens home. “We understand that this is an incredibly stressful and difficult time as we deal with these unprecedented circumstances. In Canberra, the government is working around the clock to find solutions to bring you home to Australia.

Morrison has asked social services minister, Anne Ruston, to propose options for moving the thresholds with a view to increasing the eligibility – but there is not one particular solution that has been proposed and agreed. So Australians out of work who are ineligible for jobseeker payments because their partner earns more than $48,000 will need to wait a little longer to see what the new threshold is.

Updated at 3.33am GMT 3.18am GMT Some more information has come through on Tasmania’s new restrictions (TT Line runs the Spirit of Tasmania) TT-Line is currently contacting all bookings of caravans and motorhomes of non-Tasmanian residents to advise them of the restrictions in relation to travelling to the state. Non-essential travellers must enter 14 days of self-quarantine and this self-quarantine in caravans and motorhomes is not permitted. The message is clear – if you are not a Tasmanian resident returning home or an essential traveller, do not get on the Spirit with your caravan or motorhome as you will not be able to self-isolate in it. Anyone whose booking has been cancelled as a result of these important restrictions will receive a full refund and should call TT-Line on 1800 634 906. Tasmanians returning home to the state, regardless of whether it is by air or sea, must adhere to the 14-day self-quarantine instructions currently in place. It is absolutely vital everyone plays their part to reduce the spread of Covid-19 to save lives. Updated at 3.24am GMT 3.11am GMT We are now a nation where toilet paper heists are a thing. From NSW police: Police are appealing for public assistance to identify two men following a series of thefts and attempted thefts from supermarkets in Sydney’s south west at the weekend. Between 7pm and 8.30pm last Sunday (22 March 2020), two men attended supermarkets in Granville, Auburn, Bass Hill and Lidcombe, and accessed restricted storage areas. The pair appeared to be targeting toilet paper and stole multiple packs from the Granville and Auburn stores, however, left empty handed from the stores in Bass Hill and Lidcombe. It was also reported that one of the men threatened an employee with a knife at the Auburn store. Officers from Wetherill Park Region Enforcement Squad (RES) have commenced an investigation and are now appealing to the community for information. The first man is depicted as being of Mediterranean/Middle Eastern appearance, about 185-190cm tall, aged in his 30s, with a solid build. He has tattoos on his arms and was wearing a grey collared shirt with long blue track pants. The second man is described as being 175-180cm tall with a slim build, aged between 30-35, and at the time was wearing black Adidas pants and a camouflaged hooded jumper. Updated at 3.16am GMT 3.10am GMT In addition to arguing for students, Abstudy and Austudy recipients to get coronavirus supplement payments, Labor is now claiming victory in its efforts to persuade the government to change income testing for jobseeker payments. According to shadow social services minister Linda Burney, as it stands: Australians out of work will receive nothing at all if their partner earns around $48,000 or more The JobSeeker payment tapers out by 60 cents for every dollar a person’s partner earns over $26,000 She said: “The government agreed to a commitment to adjust the income test to make more families eligible, and we anticipate the government will shortly announce the details. “Labor also secured a significant amendment to the stimulus legislation that means the government can fix the partner income test and expand payments as needed – including for age pensioners, people on DSP, carers, those out of work and anyone at risk of slipping through the cracks.” Updated at 3.13am GMT 3.09am GMT Anne Ruston on the decision to expand the Coronavirus supplement to students: \"The Government has made this decision in recognition that many full-time students also supplement their income through part-time and casual work which may not be available over coming months.\" #auspol pic.twitter.com/rDnnv9lgs9 — Luke Henriques-Gomes (@lukehgomes) March 24, 2020 2.55am GMT If you are looking to see what is happening with your local library, you can see what is still open, here 2.52am GMT Penny Wong DOES NOT have coronavirus: As soon as I am feeling well enough to travel I will return to Adelaide from Canberra.

I will let the group charged with that to do that work today. But we are developing a staged approach. We recognise and appreciate what has happened in other parts of the world. Indeed, all of us are learning from each other. But obviously, this notion of greater isolation, more time at home, less time out in groups, is what we are encouraging.

From Ben Butler and Josh Taylor: Competition regulator Rod Sims says Australia needs two big airlines and he will be contacting Qantas to ask it to end a public campaign it has mounted against rival Virgin Australia during the coronavirus crisis. Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, told Guardian Australia he would be investigating a complaint Virgin chief executive Paul Scurrah lodged against Qantas over the weekend. “It’s an important complaint and I’ve said to Paul Scurrah that we will look into it, and we will,” Sims said. Sims slapped down Qantas CEO Alan Joyce for making comments over the past week that airlines were in a battle of the “survival of the fittest” and said now was instead the time for cooperation between business rivals to make sure companies remain in place so that there can be an economic upswing when the pandemic ends.

This patient was one of the initial three passengers who were confirmed to be Covid-19 positive following testing of retained specimens from onboard the Ruby Princess. NSW Health passes on our condolences to the family of this patient. Seven people have now died in NSW having tested positive to Covid-19. So far, 133 passengers from that one cruise ship, which docked in Sydney and was given the all-clear to disperse passengers, have been diagnosed with coronavirus. It should be noted, no cases of Covid-19 had been identified by doctors onboard before docking.

He thanks them all for their efforts and mentions his own daughter Kate who is an intensive care specialist, and who is now unable to be with her family in person. “Normal familial affection” is denied us right now, Speakman says, but he looks forward to the time when we can all enjoy these freedoms again. Labor’s Paul Lynch says as a “responsible opposition” they have made the commitment not to oppose these measures proposed and commends the bill to the house. Updated at 2.26am GMT 2.23am GMT Victoria sees four fold increase in Covid-19 cases in just one week Victoria has recorded 64 new cases of Covid-19 today, bringing the total number of cases to 411. If you can remember this time last week, Victoria had just 94 cases. So that’s a four-fold increase in seven days. We have also, I think, had the youngest person so far to test positive. The new cases include people from preschool age to late 80s. This time last week Victoria had conducted 14,200 tests. Today, it’s more than 25,000. The number of cases in Victoria confirmed to be from community transmission remains at six. Twelve of the 411 are in hospital, two of whom are in intensive care, and 113, or 27% of all confirmed cases, have recovered. The majority of the cases in Victoria remain in the city. Just 41 are in regional areas. They are: 10 in Greater Geelong, four in Ballarat, two in the Baw Baws, three in Greater Shepparton, two on the Surf Coast, two in Warrnambool, two in the Macedon Ranges, three in Mitchell, three in Mount Alexander. There is also one confirmed case each in the Bass Coast, Gannawarra, Hepburn, Latrobe, Mildura, Moira, Moorabool, South Gippsland, Wellington and Yarriambiack. The department of health and human services reiterates that the penalty for not complying with mandatory self-isolation requirements is a fine of up to $20,000 for individuals or $100,000 for companies. Updated at 2.39am GMT 2.17am GMT NSW parliament is now discussing the broad powers the government wants to control the spread of the virus. The Covid-19 bill seeks “extraordinary provisions but these are extraordinary times”, attorney general Mark Speakman saying in introducing the law. “These are powers we hope we will never have to use,” Speakman says, but the development of the virus may make such measures necessary. In terms of prisons, vulnerable offenders and others who “pose a low risk” to the community would be considered for conditional release. “Offenders sentenced for the most serious offences cannot be released under these changes. Any conditional release would be subject to strict parole conditions … including home detention, pre-approved schedule of movements and electronic monitoring. Updated at 2.19am GMT 2.16am GMT Earlier on we mentioned the police taskforces being established in states including Victoria and Queensland to enforce the closures of non-essential venues. The Victorian department of health has just issued a statement saying non-compliance with isolation and distancing orders could result in significant fines for both individuals and businesses. The department says: “While most Victorians are voluntarily complying with requests to isolate, police have strong powers to enforce the direction if it’s required. Under the State of Emergency people who don’t comply with a directive could receive a fine of up to $20,000. Companies face fines of up to $100,000.” Victoria police will hold a press conference later on Tuesday afternoon about the task force. There were 64 new cases confirmed in Victoria overnight, bringing the total number of cases in the state to 411. The health department has given a breakdown of the areas affected. “Multiple cases have occurred in the regional local government areas of Greater Geelong (10), Ballarat (4), Baw Baw (2), Greater Shepparton (3), Surf Coast (2), Warrnambool (2), Macedon Ranges (2), Mitchell (3) and Mount Alexander (3). Bass Coast, Gannawarra, Hepburn, Latrobe, Mildura, Moira, Moorabool, South Gippsland, Wellington and Yarriambiack have all recorded one case.” The department says it follows up and monitors all close contacts of confirmed cases.

Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian Updated at 2.22am GMT 2.08am GMT The Queensland treasurer (and deputy premier) Jackie Trad, says she expects the impacts from Covid-19 to last longer than six months. She says the state needs to step in and fill the gap with the federal assistance, which includes displaced workers in vulnerable, seasonal work: Displaced workers expect the state government to step up and help them as well, and our $500m worker displacement program will be there to help them get jobs in areas where we know there will be shortages – in healthcare, in cleaning, in agriculture. We will be working with the business community and with the unions to get this program right and to make sure it’s supporting workers right across our state. Additionally, we will be helping iconic Queensland companies, important, large Queensland employers, who we absolutely need to survive this downturn in our economy. We need them to get through this difficult time as we need to get through this difficult time, so that when our economy bounces back, they are part of the rebuild. They can scale-up and they can start re-employing Queenslanders. But fundamentally, this is all focused on supporting workers, and supporting workers in industries that are feeling it tough. I know that there has been a lot of conversation between different jurisdictions - I sit around the table with a number of treasurers from right around the country and we are having a phone hook-up with the federal treasurer later on today. We are working as one. Making sure that our assistance packages, our support packages are complementing and amplifying the efforts of each jurisdiction and that we, together, are helping workers and helping industry get through this very difficult time in our community. Updated at 2.13am GMT 2.05am GMT The Australian stockmarket was up about 3.5% at lunchtime on Tuesday as several stocks heavily hit by the coronavirus pandemic rebounded. It’s important to note that the market remains extremely volatile and today’s gains claw back little of the gargantuan losses experienced over the past month or so. According to research by MST Marquee, this has been the fastest sharemarket collapse in a century. Shares in debt collector Credit Corp and buy-now-pay-later company Afterpay, both of which were savaged on Monday following new restrictions on making people bankrupt and the closure of the hospitality and entertainment industries, bounced dramatically in morning trade. Shortly before 1pm Credit Corp was up an absurd 42% while Afterpay was up 26%. The biggest loser was grain distributor Graincorp, which lost half its value - but that’s because it has spun off its malt division, United Malt Group, which began trading as a separately listed company on Tuesday morning. Updated at 2.07am GMT 2.04am GMT The ACT has seen another seven people diagnosed in the past 24 hours, bringing the territory’s total to 39.

BREAKING: We’re unveiling a $4 billion relief package for Queenslanders in response to coronavirus. ➡️ $2.5B to support our workers and businesses ➡️ $300M for Queensland households, including $200 off utility bills ➡️ $1.2B to strengthen our health system#qldjobs #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/0AtlV0uwFC — Annastacia Palaszczuk (@AnnastaciaMP) March 24, 2020 1.55am GMT The deputy premier Jackie Trad estimates that more than 50,000 people lost their job in Queensland just yesterday, when the hospitality industry was all but shut down. Queensland now has a $4bn business package, on top of the federal government package. Updated at 2.02am GMT 1.52am GMT It is all borders – air, rail, road and sea. Police will be enforcing the turnbacks. The state disaster co-ordinator: We accept that there will be significant impact upon persons who are ordinarily crossing our border daily. We will give messaging around that, so people clearly understand how they’re impacted, particularly those that live in border communities. However, essential services, lawful businesses and trade will not be impacted. We will provide information to these people who regularly cross the border for work purposes and give them advice as to how we can manage that so we can make it as seamless as possible. We ask our community for a high level of compliance and we will be showing a high level of compassion and communication while we deal with them. We acknowledge this inconvenience may be quite challenging for some people, but we appeal to them to comply with our directions to help manage the impact of Covid-19 on our community. You will see police officers and other officials, government officials, out on the road as of one minute past midnight tomorrow night, making sure that these measures work. If any person is allowed to come into Queensland, they have to recognise that if they don’t have these reasons to come into us, an essential purpose, they will be required to do 14 days self-quarantine regardless of whether they are symptomatic or not. Updated at 2.01am GMT 1.50am GMT The Queensland border restrictions will come into place at midnight tomorrow. 1.49am GMT Annastacia Palaszczuk: I urge people, if you are living in other states, please do not go through with your school holidays, your school break - stay at home. Stay in your state, and stay in your suburb. The measures we are putting in place are for serious public health reasons. I don’t take this decision lightly. I’m quite sure in 1918 they didn’t take the decision lightly either to close the border. That does not mean if you are an essential worker, of course you will be able to come to Queensland. If you are delivering freight, of course you will be able to come to Queensland. We do not want people coming to Queensland to have a holiday break. This is not holiday break season. This is the season to stay at home with your family. 1.48am GMT Annastacia Palaszczuk: The chief medical officer has advised me there are serious health issues of people coming from other states to Queensland. Now, that is a big problem, because if we have people who are coming here, who have the coronavirus, we do not have the resources to spend on contact tracing all of those people and checking up on where they are staying under a 14-day quarantine. So, unless you’re returning home to Queensland or coming to Queensland for an essential purpose like work or a medical appointment, or freight issues, then the border is closed to you. This is for your own public health. So, let me make it very clear: Queenslanders should stay in Queensland, people in New South Wales should stay in New South Wales and people in Victoria should stay in Victoria. Updated at 1.58am GMT 1.46am GMT Queensland to close borders – permits needed to cross the border The Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has announced strict new entry measures for non-residents. People wanting to get into Queensland will need permits to stop spread of coronavirus. Qld Police to enforce & will turn people around at border.

I know – deep in my heart I know – these are uncertain times and there are many people who will legitimately be concerned, whether it’s about their employment, but above all else about their health or the health of their family members. Our task is for all of us – for all of us together – to take the steps with regards to distancing. It’s so contrary to our nature but it’s essential to our future. So to take those steps, which will protect each of us in ourselves but all of those around us and at the same time our task is to reduce the infection and reduce the spread but to increase the capacity. These announcements today, particularly for primary care, are about providing increased capacity but also letting the Australian people know that as we flatten the curve, and reduce infection, we’re increasing the capacity and these are the things that over the coming six months will allow us to get through it, because get through this together – we will. Updated at 1.57am GMT 1.33am GMT Whole-of-population telehealth is coming, but the health experts are working out how that is rolled out. Updated at 1.34am GMT 1.27am GMT [continued from previous post] · Justice: amendments to ensure NSW courts can continue to deliver justice, with fewer people required to physically attend court. The supreme and district courts will have greater discretion to order judge-alone trials, reducing the need to summon large numbers of potential jurors. Vulnerable people will be exempt from jury summons. Increased use of A/V and pre-recording evidence of key witnesses and apprehended domestic violence orders will be extended from 28 days to six months. · Corrections: amendments will give power to the governor to decide who might be eligible for potential conditional release on parole. “These extraordinary measures are only to be used to respond to the threat of Covid-19, and would allow the commissioner of corrective services to prioritise vulnerable offenders and others who pose a low risk to the community for consideration for conditional release. “Offenders sentenced for the most serious offences cannot be released under these changes. “Any conditional release would be subject to strict parole conditions, as well as any other requirements the Commissioner considers appropriate, including home detention, pre-approved schedule of movements and electronic monitoring. In addition, the commissioner may prohibit or restrict any person from entering or visiting correctional facilities.” · Better regulation: In response to panic buying and stockpiling, an amendment to the Retail Trading Act will allow supermarkets to stock their shelves and trade throughout the Easter long weekend and Anzac Day this year, ensuring food and other essential items are available at standard retail prices. But the Greens MP and justice spokesperson, David Shoebridge, said: “Parliament must retain critical oversight of any emergency measures. “Extraordinary powers cannot be allowed to proliferate in the absence of any scrutiny, particularly given the tensions we will see play out between our fundamental rights and freedoms, and the unquestionable need for strict public health measures. “We will be opposing the government’s plan to adjourn the parliament until 16 September, any special adjournment should be no longer than 1 month.” Updated at 1.38am GMT 1.27am GMT NSW parliament is now sitting to discuss an emergency bill giving the government broad new powers to combat the spread of Covid-19. The attorney general, Mark Speakman, said the government was acting swiftly to ensure we are as prepared as possible to respond to the evolving threat of coronavirus, while reducing the risk of further transmission in the community. “Our No 1 priority is the health and safety of the people of NSW,” Speakman said. But the opposition parties have reservations about giving the government broad powers to change the law without oversight of parliament for the next six months. The Covid-19 legislation amendment (emergency measures) bill proposes: · Health: to give police power to take immediate action on suspected breaches of Covid-19 public health orders, including returning those in breach to their residence or place of quarantine. NSW Health will have more flexibility to use private health facilities when urgently required and streamline the establishment of state vaccine centres to better manage the flu season. The mental health tribunal will be able to conduct inquiries by telephone and extend existing community treatment orders for a further three months. Updated at 1.36am GMT 1.24am GMT Health minister warns of further lockdown restrictions Further lockdowns are coming. Greg Hunt: We have always indicated as the prime minister said and the national cabinet said, this was stage one. It is not the last stage. I think I should be very upfront and honest about that. Right as we speak, those next stages are being designed and the timing and the implementation measures for it are being carefully considered. What’s the value of the national cabinet? It pools our health professionals together and our leaders together, to take these steps together. Updated at 1.28am GMT 1.22am GMT Greg Hunt says direct text messages are coming, with information on Covid-19 and the government’s response. Updated at 1.34am GMT 1.21am GMT Alison McMillan is the Australian government’s chief nursing and midwifery officer. She makes an appearance at this Greg Hunt press conference as well: If you’re sick, stay at home. Do not go out. Get other people to do things for you, but you need to stay at home. For everybody else, this means we need to maintain that social distancing. We’ve all seen it out there in the community already. We’re all walking around each other. Please keep that up. It’s really important. Hands – wash your hands frequently, wash them before you eat, wash them after you’ve been to the bathroom, or use the alcohol hand sanitiser as often as you like. Cough etiquette and sneezing – remember it’s really important you cough or sneeze into your elbow. If you use a tissue, throw it away straight away and wash your hands. All of us need to play a part in this and this is how the community can help protect everyone. The minister has spoken around intensive care. We will need to expand and double our intensive care capacity. That work has been done in collaboration with the intensive care doctors and nurses out there who are going to rise to this occasion and provide the care we need to those most vulnerable. I speak finally to one particular topic. That is that we ask everyone, if you are tested positive, that is the moment you go home, don’t go to the pharmacies or anywhere else, the shops – please go straight home and ask others to help you. There is a pharmacy system that now will come to you. You can find the details of that and the details of many of the things you ask on our website, health.gov.au. Updated at 1.33am GMT 1.18am GMT Australia has 2,000 ventilators in its intensive care wards. Greg Hunt says the government is working to double that capacity. The health panel is also urgently working on which consultations can be fast tracked through the telehealth system, and which still need face-to-face appearances. Updated at 1.32am GMT 1.16am GMT Mildura’s only newspaper, the Sunraysia Daily, has announced it will suspend printing and stand down its staff due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The newspaper announced its own closure in an article, saying staff had been informed of the decision on Tuesday morning. “It was proposed that Saturday’s paper would be the last edition until further notice,” the paper said. “Staff were told the intention was for operations to eventually resume.” Owned by the Elliott Newspaper Group, the Sunraysia Daily is Mildura’s only daily newspaper and is in its 100th year of operation. The meeting happened at about 10.30am this morning, with staff addressed by the paper’s general manager and owners. They were told the virus had seen an already challenging advertising market completely dry up. Staff at the paper estimate there about 50 people onsite, including at the in-house printing press. The Elliot Newspaper Group also publishes the Sunraysia Life, the Guardian in Swan Hill and Gannawarra Times, all of which will be impacted by the closure. The closures mean the local ABC radio station becomes the only news outlet serving the region. Mlidura’s local Win television station also closed in 2015. “Basically we go until Friday and then after that line up at Centrelink,” one staff member told the Guardian. Updated at 1.31am GMT 1.15am GMT An additional 150,000 Covid-19 test kits have arrived in Australia. 1.5 million point of care tests have also been ordered, which Greg Hunt says will help with healthcare worker testing — Tom McIlroy (@TomMcIlroy) March 24, 2020 Updated at 1.26am GMT 1.12am GMT Masks for medical staff: In relation to the medical community, with regards to masks, we’ve just had 1.5m masks arrive in the previous couple of days. There is mask production being developed in Australia and I mentioned previously that we are expecting 54m masks by the end of April. I’m now advised that in fact 30m of those will be in the country within the next two weeks, ahead of schedule, which I think is important. We will count them when we’ve got them. What that will allow us to do is to provide a very important commitment to our general practitioners of 5m masks, delivered through the primary health networks, to support them in their work over the period between now and 30 June. But doctors will still have to use those carefully, Greg Hunt says, as we are “operating at our capacity” in terms of orders. Updated at 1.15am GMT 1.07am GMT Greg Hunt says Australia has stepped up its testing: In terms of progress, with regards to testing, the latest figures is there have now been approximately 147,000 pathology tests carried out in Australia. On a per-capita basis on the advice from the National Incidence Centre, that means we now have 557.9 approximately tests per 100,000 or greater than 0.5% of the population. This is on the advice I have, higher than even Korea, which has done a magnificent job with their testing on a per-capita basis. Why is that important? What it means is that we are picking up a very large proportion of those tests through the breadth and width of our testing, that approximately 1.2% of total cases tested have been positive, and so just under 99% of total cases have been negative. Updated at 1.14am GMT 1.05am GMT Greg Hunt press conference The federal health minister says there have been “disturbing reports” of abuse of health workers Our doctors and our nurses, our receptionists, our health workers, our allied health workers are our heroes for the months to come. If we take care of them, they can take care of us. Hunt says people will be be charged if they abuse workers. Updated at 1.14am GMT 1.02am GMT Australia’s sporting leagues are trying to work out how they survive (like so hundreds of thousands across the nation) given that they have all shut down, at least for now. Sponsorships and broadcast payments make up the bulk of payments for these leagues, meaning that everything is up in the air at the moment. AFL players have offered to take a 50% pay cut while the season is suspended. For some clubs, that won’t be enough. Members are reporting that their memberships are still being taken by the clubs, which, for people who have found themselves in financial stress overnight, is an issue. There are no answers there as yet. Updated at 1.14am GMT 12.47am GMT The Australian Council of Social Services has put together an advice sheet for accessing Centrelink: If you already receive Newstart or another payment, you do not need to contact Centrelink to get the extra support announced. If you are still getting paid, still have income coming in, if you can wait a few days, that may help. If you don’t need payments urgently, wait a day or two to connect. For people who have lost their jobs and need to apply for a payment urgently: Online: If you have digital access, try applying online through MyGov. Try again later if you cannot get through. The government has enacted Intent to Claim processes so people don’t have to lodge a full claim immediately, and they will be back paid to the day they lodged their intent to claim. In other words, people won’t miss out on income support because of delays to lodge a completed claim. Phone: We know many people do not have online access. The phone number for Jobseeker Payment is 132 850. In person: If you do decide to line up, please practice social distancing. We are also monitoring advice from Centrelink. Don’t give up. For those who can access Centrelink via online or phone, please don’t give up – try again later. We will see unprecedented levels of demand for Centrelink. Understanding on all sides as Centrelink staff are doing all they can to help people trying to get support. Things may take some time. The Government’s commitment to hiring 5,000 extra Centrelink staff is very welcome and we urge Government to move quickly to get these staff on deck. Updated at 12.58am GMT 12.47am GMT Michael McGowan will have more information on this for you soon. Sunraysia Daily is closing down indefinitely at the end of the week due to the coronavirus. It was meant to be celebrating its centenary this year. This will leave Mildura without a daily paper, five years after the only local TV newsroom was shut down. A dark day for the town. — Christopher Testa (@cmtesta) March 24, 2020 12.44am GMT The Queensland premier and deputy premier will be holding a press conference in the next hour to explain how they plan on closing the border. Updated at 12.46am GMT 12.34am GMT Queensland police have followed Victoria police in creating a taskforce to ensure that people and venues are adhering to social distancing and shutdown measures. In a statement, Queensland police said the multi-agency taskforce would ensure compliance with directions now in place for all pubs, registered and licensed clubs, gyms, indoor sporting venues, casinos and nightclubs. The statement said: These measures are aimed at reducing the spread of Covid-19 and ensuring overall public health and safety. Police have certain powers under the Public Health Act 2005 (Qld) to ensure compliance with the intent of the legislation, and penalty provisions apply. Yesterday the Victorian government refused to answer my questions about the kinds of actions that would be taken against those found to be breaking the rules. The government and Victoria police said they would not be expanding on their initial statement, which read: Victoria Police has conducted a number of spot checks to ensure people are self-isolating in accordance with the advice of the Chief Health Officer. Police will continue to do spot checks and respond to requests from the Department of Health and Human Services. For operational reasons, we will not disclose how these checks are being undertaken or how many have been conducted so far. At this stage, no one has been charged with refusing or failing to comply with direction. Meanwhile in the Northern Territory, parliamentary sittings resume in Darwin today to debate emergency legislation to deal with the response to Covid-19. Updated at 12.42am GMT 12.25am GMT There are still massive wait times to access myGov. Social services minister Anne Ruston said capacity on MyGov was increased overnight to 150,000 concurrent users and there was 123,000 this morning and \"was still operating and operating much more quickly than it was yesterday.\" Uhh https://t.co/L3gLFTFSe0 — Josh Taylor (@joshgnosis) March 24, 2020 Updated at 12.27am GMT 12.21am GMT Centrelink clarifications Right. So, answers. Partner earning threshold: Currently, if your partner earns more than $48,000 you will NOT be eligible for the coronavirus payments. The government is working to change that threshold to $75,000 but that change has not come in as yet. Getting a CRN: You DO NOT have to go into Centrelink. You DO have to get one over the phone and there are very, very long wait times. But you DO NOT have to physically attend a Centrelink office. Identity can be verified OVER THE PHONE. You DO NOT have to attend a Centrelink office to do that. Students: If you receive youth allowance, as a student or apprentice, you will receive the supplement after an amendment to the bill last night. Skilled visa holders: The government is working on what you can be eligible for, but at the moment, nothing has changed there. Already receiving Centrelink payments: You DO NOT have to do anything. It should be applied automatically. Updated at 12.28am GMT 12.17am GMT The myGov website is still showing an error message for lots of people – the numbers, despite being boosted, are still not enough. 12.16am GMT Anne Ruston says she is working through the number of visa types in Australia, to see what is available for those people to receive social security payments. In relation to visas, certainly there’s been some commentary around it. We made the decision, which was announced on Sunday, that anybody who is on a pathway to citizenship and is serving their new arrival waiting period, that waiting period would be waived so they would be automatically eligible to access the same benefits as a jobseeker, and everything that goes with that ... That’s in relates to those on the pathway to citizenship. There are a range of different visas that sit and there are so many of them. I am currently working my way through those visa types to see what options there are available to assist those people. But what I would say is that I already have the capacity as the minister for social services in legislation – the capacity to grant what we call special benefit to those people on visas that would not otherwise be eligible to Australian social security payments if they are in a time of financial hardship. That is already in place, but yesterday they supercharged those powers by the regulation last night, which means that I can look more broadly at all of them. Updated at 12.29am GMT 12.13am GMT Anne Ruston confirms that if your partner earns over $48,000, you will NOT be eligible for the coronavirus payments: Once you get to, I ... think it’s $48,001 or thereabouts, is currently when it will cut out. Below that, the partner only needs to be eligible for $1, so slightly under that, so they will be eligible for the coronavirus payment as we sit here today but, as I said, the powers that were granted to me last night will enable me to make changes to that if that’s the decision which could change that and see that move up. Updated at 12.29am GMT 12.11am GMT How was it screwed up, so comprehensively, given every human and their cat knew this was coming? Anne Ruston: Well, I wouldn’t accept your categorisation. What I would say is there’s been a number of factors that have played into the increased demand spike that we saw yesterday. Obviously, the rapid escalation on Sunday when we saw a number of changes by the federal government and the state government that escalated the people yesterday, finding themselves in a position when they went to work in the morning that they no longer had a job. The other thing that it would be great to get out to people is that we are seeing a lot of misinformation on social media telling people to go and do things that aren’t correct, and so what I’d say is truth-test anything that you see on social media. Truth-test it with the media that are in this room who are credible media. Go on to a government website, whether it be the myGov website or the Australia.gov.au website, and truth-test what you’re seeing on social media, because I think that a lot of people have been led to believe things that aren’t true because of what they’ve seen. We certainly understand that yesterday was an extraordinary spike in the number of people that were looking to use the service and overnight Sunday night. We increased capacity. Yesterday, we put another 5,000 people on to meet the demand. This is an unprecedented situation. Updated at 12.30am GMT 12.08am GMT Social services minister's press conference Anne Ruston is holding a press conference to try and clear up the mass confusion over the coronavirus payments, not helped by her partner minister, Stuart Robert, who has continually issued the incorrect information: What is the cut off for the coronavirus payment? At the moment, for a single person with no dependents it’s $1,850. But anybody who is eligible for $1 of payment or their spouse is eligible for $1 of payment, will also be eligible for all of the other benefits that people who are on social security are able to access. The minister has been given the powers to change that, if she deems it necessary. Do you need to attend a Centrelink office physically to apply? Yesterday Centrelink made changes so that you are no longer required to attend a Centrelink site to provide proof of identity – which is what you’re referring to. Yesterday, the changes came into place which require you only to provide proof of identity over the phone, so you can ring up any of our Centrelink call centres, you can say, identify yourself, we will not require you to provide any physical demonstration. We will only require you to actually advise us and we’ll take your word for it, understanding these are exceptional circumstances and we don’t want people attending Centrelink sites in person. They will then give you a validation that says, yes, you are who you say you are on the basis of what you’ve said, and then you can go online and register through myGov, or equally, if you don’t want to do that, you can remain on the phone and do your rental operation on the phone. Updated at 12.31am GMT 12.03am GMT Stuart Robert is still trying to clean up the mess he created. After saying you could get a customer reference number (CRN) online (which was not true), he is now admitting it has to be done over the phone. SAus have massively surged capacity into MyGov overnight. There are right now 123,000 concurrent users (max 55,000 yesterday and only 6000 last Friday). Get a CRN via the phone - 132850 and go to MyGov to link and claim Jobseeker payment — Stuart Robert MP (@stuartrobertmp) March 23, 2020 11.58pm GMT And on Stuart Robert’s admission he “jumped the gun” and blamed a cyber attack for the myGov failure yesterday, when it was just a case of the system being overwhelmed because he didn’t prepare for the sheer numbers of people who would need help, Anthony Albanese says: Stuart Robert, you know, has said today, flippantly, apparently, you know, “My bad.” Well, it’s a bit more serious than that. And the minister and the government need to be accurate in the information that they’re putting forward at all times, but particularly at this time. Updated at 12.03am GMT 11.55pm GMT In terms of future lockdowns, Anthony Albanese says it should be whatever the health experts think: I’m saying that the health experts need to be listened to, shouldn’t be second-guessed by politicians. If the health experts are saying that is going to happen, then we should be responding accordingly. He also said there needs to be clearer messages: We’re not trying to look for – be very clear here – we’re not trying to look for false distinctions with the government here. I think, indeed, it is important that there be as much unity as possible. I think there were very confusing messages, to be frank, even yesterday. I think the idea that we say schools are open, but we don’t want kids to go there, is a mixed message. And we need to be much clearer about it. Updated at 12.02am GMT 11.53pm GMT Most the Australian passengers who were trapped on the Costa Luminosa in Italy have finally been allowed on land. After repeated changes of plans, and even the Australian embassy being left in the dark, it seems those who were allowed off the boat in Savona and have been packed on to buses destined for Rome. They will now have to wait out a two-week quarantine period in hotel rooms. The embassy has assured passengers there will be adequate medical care. But the family members of passengers say those who have tested positive for Covid-19 have not been allowed off. They do not yet know if the ship will stay in the port of Savon as they wait out their illness or will travel to Tuscany as originally planned, where there is now less strain on hospitals. Related: Australians onboard Costa Luminosa cruise feel 'kidnapped' after being forced to isolate in Italy Updated at 11.58pm GMT 11.50pm GMT Labor wants the $750 payments (one at the end of this month and one in July) put together and put out as fast as possible. It also wants answers on rent relief. Anthony Albanese: One of the things that small business has said to me is that a number of them – your local cafe all of a sudden has shut up, doesn’t have any work, still has to pay rent. They can do some things in terms of takeaway, but a range of businesses can’t. Gyms, for example, can’t do gym work by remote, off-site. It can’t happen. All of a sudden, they have had their income reduced to zero. I know of one case that pays $30,000 a month in rent. And when they contacted their landlord, they were told, “No, you’ve gotta keep paying your rent.” Well, that business won’t survive. We need relief in terms of small business, in particular, but we also need to plan for individuals. The concern that we have is if people are literally unable to pay their rent and evicted from property, then what we will have is consequences that are dire, indeed, for health, in terms of it’s impossible to self-isolate. One of the things I said in parliament yesterday was, “How do you self-isolate if you’re homeless?” The national cabinet will be looking at this issue tonight. Updated at 11.57pm GMT 11.44pm GMT Anthony Albanese: We have got to remember this is all about people. Today the queues outside Centrelink are longer than they were yesterday. We’ve got to remember so many people out there are anxious, are scared about their futures. So many people rely on the day-to-day income, whether it be their wage or their Newstart payment, or their pension, to get by on a day-to-day basis. It’s why the messaging has to be clear on these issues. The government have said they’ll need to come back for further stimulus measures, and we think that’s right. We don’t believe this package is perfect, and it’s not the package that Labor would have put forward. But we weren’t going to stand in the way of a package which was urgent. Updated at 11.56pm GMT 11.33pm GMT If you are already in the Centrelink system (as in you are already receiving a payment), and are eligible, you should not have to do anything more to receive the additional payments. If you need to access Centrelink for the first time, you will need a customer reference number – a CRN – before you can access it online. You can get this from the phone service, but there are massive delays. If you have access to a phone, you can avoid Centrelink, physically. Updated at 11.56pm GMT 11.30pm GMT Anthony Albanese says Stuart Robert’s “my bad” response to misrepresenting why the myGov system had failed (he blamed a DDOS attack, when it was just overwhelmed by people desperately and legitimately trying to access the site) was “not the finest moment in Australian politics”. “If we have people just making things up then that is a very bad thing indeed, because it breaks people’s trust in the system,” Albanese says. 11.23pm GMT The government is pushing this site – australia.gov.au – as having the “most up to date” coronavirus information. For the most up-to-date and accurate Coronavirus information, please visit: https://t.co/j2Uv2XtqF9 pic.twitter.com/cOuyUbzPxi — Peter Dutton (@PeterDutton_MP) March 23, 2020 It hasn’t been updated since 4.50pm yesterday. In that time, a lot has changed – the stimulus package passed, Centrelink confusion, more border lockdowns and an increase in cases. Updated at 11.31pm GMT 11.18pm GMT Market update The Australian market opened up about 2% on Tuesday morning despite a raft of companies revealing the damage the coronavirus pandemic was doing to their operations and falls overseas overnight. The mining giant Rio Tinto said it was cutting production in South Africa and Canada due to the outbreak. The broadcaster Seven West Media withdrew its profit forecasts, citing a fall in ads and the postponement of the Olympics. Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, which was formed from the merger of the Australian Westfield group with France’s Unibail-Rodamco and owns shopping centres across Europe and the US, will cancel its final dividend this year but is pressing ahead with an interim one, due to be paid on Thursday. Shaver Shop has cancelled its dividend. Many of the companies worst affected by the pandemic, including the travel agency Flight Centre and the online flight sales site Webjet, are suspended from trade. Updated at 11.27pm GMT 11.14pm GMT Anne Ruston’s press conference has now been moved to 11am. I guess the minister is having trouble getting clear information as well. 11.07pm GMT The A-League season has been postponed, bringing all top-level sport in Australia to a halt as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Football Federation Australia announced on Tuesday morning the competition would be put on hold at least until the decision was reviewed on 22 April. Monday night’s game between Newcastle and Melbourne City, won 1-0 by the Jets, proved to be the last for the time being, despite FFA’s hopes of playing out a condensed version of the season. The A-League was one of few major sporting competitions globally still running at the beginning of the week but the federal government’s advice on Monday against all non-essential travel within Australia effectively made the continuation of the season untenable. The decision follows that of the NRL on Monday to suspend its season indefinitely, while the AFL had put its men’s competition on hold a day previously and cancelled the AFLW season outright. The W-League season was able to be completed at the weekend, with Melbourne City crowned champions after the grand final was played in an empty stadium. The FFA’s chief executive, James Johnson, said: Our priority is to ensure the safety of both the football community and the community at large. As each passing day raises additional concerns for the safety of both, it is imperative that we follow the lead of governments at national and state level and take the necessary precautionary and proactive measures and in doing so play our part in preventing the spread and impact of Covid-19. To get so close to completing the competition, only to pull up a few weeks short, has been heartbreaking for the players, clubs and fans. That said, the health and safety of our fans, players, volunteers and staff has always been the overriding consideration for us. Updated at 11.26pm GMT 11.06pm GMT The social services minister, Anne Ruston, will be holding a press conference at 10.30am as the government scrambles to give people a clear message on what they are supposed to do to access the coronavirus payments. To be clear, the coronavirus supplement does not start until 27 April. Until then, it is just the standard jobseeker payment. The $750 stimulus payment will be paid at the end of the month. Updated at 11.11pm GMT 11.02pm GMT A-League season postponed The A-League season has been postponed, bringing all top-level sport in Australia to a halt as a result of the coronavirus pandemic 10.59pm GMT This is why the confusion is reigning. No one is getting the same answer twice Centrelink have just confirmed to my office that you can only get a CRN (required to complete support application on myGov) either face to face or by phone. If @stuartrobertmp knew anything about the system!!! #COVID19Aus #auspol2020 — Joanne Ryan MP (@JoanneRyanLalor) March 23, 2020 10.57pm GMT How to make a jobseeker claim There is a lot of confusion about about what is happening with Centrelink payments. This especially seems to be a problem for people who haven’t received income support before. We are still trying to make sense of the situation, too. We have compiled an explainer. But here are some quick tips. Making a claim for jobseeker payment After you create a MyGov account, which is where you can make a claim, you will be asked for a Centrelink customer reference number. The government says you can get this by calling Centrelink. (There will probably be delays.) You DO NOT need to go into a Centrelink office. That is what the minister Stuart Robert said yesterday. When does the $550 a fortnight coronavirus supplement start? From 27 April The following payments will be increased by $550pf: jobseeker payment; youth allowance; parenting payment (partnered and single); Austudy; Abstudy; farm household allowance; special benefit You will be back paid from when you inform Centrelink you want to make a payment claim, not when it is approved If your experiences don’t reflect this advice, please email luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com. Updated at 11.10pm GMT 10.33pm GMT That is a big change from Tasmania. Before it had said it would require all visitors to self-isolate. Now it is turning non-essential travellers (health workers and the like are essential) and non-residents away from the border. Updated at 10.46pm GMT 10.28pm GMT If you have been on a cruise ship, STAY INSIDE and self-isolate for two weeks. If you have travelled overseas, STAY INSIDE and self-isolate for two weeks. Updated at 10.43pm GMT 10.28pm GMT Tasmanian authorities are trying to contact trace passengers from four cruise ships: The Ruby Princess The Ovation of the Seas The Celebrity Solstice The Voyager of the Seas All of which were allowed into Sydney and for the passengers to disperse. Tasmania is seeing its infection rate increase because of Tasmanians returning home after cruises Updated at 10.43pm GMT 10.26pm GMT If you're not Tasmanian, stay away, premier says Tasmania is moving into a hardline stance about who can enter the state, shutting down the Trans-Tasman ferry line, the TT line, to all but “essential travellers” and Tasmanian residents. It has had six more cases, bringing the total number of people diagnosed to 28. Four of those six had been on the Ruby Princess, which was allowed to dock in Sydney last week. Another person had been on another cruise ship, the Celebrity Solstice, which was also able to dock in Sydney. The sixth had travelled overseas. There is NO community transmission – as yet. But the lockdown is getting more serious. Peter Gutwein: In terms of TT line, as of today there is a hardline position in place today that unless you’re an essential traveller, or a Tasmanian returning home on the TT line, you will not be travelling with us. The self-isolation rules have been applied and largely are being adhered to but I want to be absolutely certain and so, as from today, if you are travelling to Tasmania and it’s non-essential travel, do not come. Do not get on the TT line. What we will do is turn you around and ask you to go back. Updated at 10.43pm GMT 10.18pm GMT The Taronga zoos are closing because of Covid-19: For the health and safety of our guests, staff and the broader community, and to comply with social distancing measures, mandated by government and health authorities across the country to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, Taronga Zoo Sydney and Taronga Western Plains Zoo are required to temporarily close, effective 5pm Wednesday 25 March 2020. This closure includes the Taronga Institute of Science & Learning, all overnight accommodation across both Taronga Zoo Sydney and Taronga Western Plains Zoo and the Taronga Function Centre. While both Zoos will be closed to the public, Taronga’s essential staff will continue to ensure the welfare and safety of the animals in our care remains at the highest possible standard. Whilst non-essential staff will work mostly remotely, ensuring our commitments to conservation and education continue at this challenging time. Updated at 10.20pm GMT 10.17pm GMT New Zealand will move into its alert four-stage lockdown very soon – which means an almost total lockdown, as is being seen in Germany and the UK. Donald Trump says the US is “not built to be shut down” and he is working on reopening regions. We also have a large team working on what the next steps will be once the medical community gives a region the OK, meaning the OK to get going, to get back, let’s go to work. Our country wasn’t built to be shut down. This is not a country that was built for this. It was not built to be shut down. Updated at 10.20pm GMT 10.05pm GMT Doctors are calling for people to be released from Australia’s immigration detention centres: Related: 'We are sitting ducks for Covid 19': asylum seekers write to PM after detainee tested in immigration detention Updated at 10.07pm GMT 10.04pm GMT The cruise ship full of more than 100 Australian doctors, nurses and medical experts that was trapped off the coast of Chile after the country closed its borders will dock at the Falkland Islands soon to get the passengers out and back home, the cruise company has confirmed. The flights will leave Stanley in a few days, according to Hurtigruten. “Over the past weeks, Hurtigruten has helped thousands of guests safely home,” a spokeswoman said. Travel restrictions due to the coronavirus outbreak are making all travel more complex. “We are confident that we will get everyone on MS Roald Amundsen home as well – in a timely manner considering the travel restrictions and other circumstances.” The medical experts had been on board for a trip to Antarctica after a medical conference. The spokeswoman said there were no confirmed or suspected cases of coronavirus onboard the ship. Updated at 10.10pm GMT 10.01pm GMT Stuart Robert also says it was “heartbreaking stuff” to see the scenes of people lining up outside Centrelink offices: Decent people finding themselves very quickly in very desperate circumstances”. That sort of narrative says everything about the minister. There is no delineation between people who found themselves on welfare payments before the coronavirus crisis and now. You are no less worthy for needing Centrelink before a pandemic. That the government has finally seen fit to increase the payment, because of the sheer numbers of underemployment and job losses we are about to see, says everything about how impossible it was to live on what was on offer as part of the “social security blanket” before this crisis. 9.49pm GMT 'My bad' says Stuart Robert over Centrelink failures The minister in charge of government services, Stuart Robert, spoke to Alan Jones on Sydney radio 2GB about his insistence yesterday the MyGov failures were the result of a DDOS attack, before being forced to admit that yes, the system was just overwhelmed. He was as compassionate as ever: “I probably should have waited for the investigation before jumping the gun. “ ... We prepared, over the weekend, for 55,000 I didn’t think I’d have to prepare for 100,000 concurrent users. “Again my bad not realising the sheer scale of the decision on Sunday night by national leaders that literally saw hundreds of thousands, maybe a million, people unemployed overnight.” Updated at 9.57pm GMT 9.44pm GMT The union which looks after retail workers (including supermarket staff) is calling for new measures to be put in place to protect workers: On top of measures already introduced, the SDA is calling for retailers to: 1. Go ‘cash free’ and accept card payments only. 2. Install plexiglass screens at cash registers to protect workers who cannot keep at least 1.5 metres from customers. 3. Display signage and floor marking to ensure social distancing. 4. Ensure sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol content is readily available to all staff. 5. Provide workers with gloves and personal face shields. 6. Provide bags free of charge for each purchase to avoid handling of customer bags. No use of customers’ used bags unless the customer bags it themselves. 7. Continue to increase security to assist in enforcing purchase limits and in dealing with unreasonable customers. Police resources may also need to be deployed to protect workers. Ensure regular cleaning and sanitisation of workstations and personal protective equipment. 8. Take a zero tolerance approach to customer violence and abuse. 9. Publicly promote the SDA’s No One Deserve A Serve campaign to improve customer behaviour. Updated at 9.58pm GMT 9.41pm GMT Ed Husic is on Sky News talking about the urgency with which people need to get advice and access to the Centrelink payments. As Laura Jayes rightly points out, there are people with less than $10 in their bank accounts, and this idea people have savings to fall back on, is farcical. There was a five-day waiting period for processing claims BEFORE this crisis. Updated at 9.58pm GMT 9.23pm GMT The ACCC has approved some new measures for supermarket chains to ensure the supply chain is not broken. Supermarket operators will be able to coordinate immediately to ensure consumers have reliable and fair access to groceries during the Covid-19 pandemic following the ACCC’s granting of interim authorisation. The interim authorisation will allow supermarkets to coordinate with each other when working with manufacturers, suppliers and transport and logistics providers. The purpose of this is to ensure the supply and the fair and equitable distribution of fresh food, groceries and other household items to Australian consumers, including those who are vulnerable or live in rural and remote areas. The authorisation allows a range of coordinated activities but does not allow supermarkets to agree on retail prices for products. Updated at 9.27pm GMT 9.21pm GMT Lines for Centrelink (now Services Australia) are still resembling Great Depression lines for help. There are thousands of people all around the country lining up outside the office. People just want help and advice and a clear instruction over what they need to do. Staff at Centrelink have been cut over the past six years, with more and more services migrating online. Anyone who has had anything to do with Centrelink in the last few years knows that even if you go in you get directed to a computer. Anne Ruston, the social services minister, is urging people to go on the MyGov website, instead of lining up: The day that you actually start your application with Centrelink will be the day from which you’ll be eligible to receive your payment. So we would be asking the Australian public for calm, because we need to make sure these services are open for those people who really are in the most desperate need for them. The website can only handle (at this stage) 55,000 people accessing it at once. Previously, that was 6,000 people at once – but even with the increase, with an additional million people expected to come on board the system, it’s not enough. Ruston says if you already receive a Centrelink payment, you should just see the money come into your account: We are asking the Australian public, if you don’t need to go on to the MyGov website – so, for instance, if you’re already on payment, you don’t need to contact Centrelink. The payments will automatically turn up into your bank account. So we’d be asking you perhaps not to contact or to use the Centrelink services for the next few days. Updated at 9.28pm GMT 9.14pm GMT Gladys Berejiklian is having to defend her schools decision – there has been confusion over the message “schools are open, but keep your children home if you can”. Berejiklian says the absentee rates had hit 41% even before the announcement, but the schools need to stay open for parents who have no other choice. So schools are open. If you can keep your children at home, you should. If you can’t, then your children will not be turned away from school. Teachers and staff who are uncomfortable staying at work, or who are in the high-risk category, can work from home. Principals have been advised to make sure that happens. Updated at 9.15pm GMT 9.10pm GMT The NSW premier says the state is ramping up its compliance because enough people aren’t following the rules. Good government means prudent planning, it means making sure you have a no-regrets policy. And I have a no-regrets policy. I’m incredibly pleased with the decisions we’ve taken to date. I don’t regret any of them. Because I believe they’re in the best interests of our citizens, and I continue to make decisions based on the best interests of our citizens, because we are in uncertain times. And I want to look back and think that every time we made a decision it was the right one for our people. And I don’t care when criticism I get. Throw it at me, because I’m doing it because I believe it’s in the best interests of the citizens of New South Wales. We are a different state to the rest of Australia. We have the most people returned from overseas. We have the highest number of cases. We have the highest concentration. But to give you assurance, we also have the highest rates of testing, and that’s what’s giving me comfort. 9.08pm GMT Gladys Berejiklian: We need to make sure everybody who’s in self-isolation stays in self-isolation. We are ramping up our compliance. We’re making sure that people are followed up. If they’re supposed to be in self-isolation and they’re not, there are harsh penalties and we’ll enforce that. We have to take this seriously. And if New South Wales citizens follow the health advice, which is if you’re self-isolating, stay in self-isolation. That includes contacts, direct contacts of people who have been diagnosed with the virus. If you are under those instructions, please, please follow those instructions. Do not go out into the community. The quicker we stop the spread, the more handle, the more control we’ll have over this virus. 9.07pm GMT Gladys Berejiklian says NSW has 149 new cases of Covid-19 The NSW premier is holding her morning press conference. She again urges people to stay inside and follow the rules. NSW has seen an increase of 149 cases overnight, with 818 people in the state now diagnosed with Covid-19. Updated at 9.17pm GMT 9.04pm GMT With nearly two million people expected to access the coronavirus supplement payment passed over night, there are a lot of people who have never navigated Australia’s complex social service network before.

Great Full Story today https://t.co/GUb6jhHGDW — Gabrielle Jackson (@gabriellecj) March 23, 2020 9.02pm GMT Nationalisation of some industries is still on the agenda – particularly when it comes to the airline industry in Australia. Nationalisation just means the federal government steps in to help prop up the business (in this case, it would be a partial nationalisation, if it happens at all). But some of the states and jurisdictions are moving ahead to try and save some of the smaller airlines which are the only services to some of the most remote communities. Queensland has been subsidising Rex airlines, which has stopped flights everywhere but that states, and now the Northern Territory is also stepping in. The territory Labor government will immediately deliver a $2m support package to retain the regular passenger transport (RPT) aviation services, which are essential for our regional and remote towns in the territory. The territory aviation sector has been significantly impacted by the necessary decision to limit travel in and out of remote communities to essential personnel only. Continuing the supply of essential goods and services will ensure the protection and support of our communities under these trying circumstances. Although the coronavirus infection rate in the territory remains very low, the economic impact of this pandemic is already hitting many territorians and sectors, including businesses and industries. Updated at 9.07pm GMT 8.53pm GMT The Essential pollsters were out in the field last week, so if you are reading this, keep that in mind, but this is worrying when it comes to the overarching issue of trust. From Katharine Murphy: One-third of people in the latest Guardian Essential survey believe there has been an overreaction to the threat of the coronavirus, and only 35% of the sample trust the media to give them honest and reliable information about the pandemic. The latest survey of 1,034 respondents suggests men, and voters aged under 34, are more likely to think there has been an overreaction than voters over 55, and women. A majority (64%) say they feel informed about the evolving health crisis and the impact on their family, but the feedback from voters shows there is a substantial trust deficit about information presented by the media. Related: Guardian Essential poll: one-third say there has been an overreaction to coronavirus 8.43pm GMT Queensland will shut its borders tomorrow. There aren’t a lot of details on how that will work as yet – the premier announced it over Twitter following a cabinet meeting, but there hasn’t been any more information, other than it will take affect from midnight tomorrow. The southern border is the problem – a lot of people live on one side of the border and work on the other. We should get more details on that soon.

Updated at 8.47pm GMT 8.36pm GMT For anyone still confused about schools, here are the changes: Victoria: schools are CLOSED, with the holidays brought forward to today. NSW: Schools are OPEN, although parents are encouraged to keep their kids at home, if they can. ACT: Schools are PUPIL FREE, although any students dropped off at school will be cared for.

Related: Police to monitor cruise ship Magnifica as it refuels in WA to ensure no one disembarks 8.22pm GMT Good morning The parliament passed the necessary legislation to make the coronavirus stimulus package law and has changed all the procedures to postpone the next sitting until August. As it’s in “emergency mode” if urgent legislation is needed, it can reconvene. But there are a couple of break-in-case-of-emergency regulations built into the legislation last night, so the parliament shouldn’t have to sit any time soon. Labor and the Greens combined to amend the legislation to ensure students were included, which passed. The government is predicting at least 1 million people will need to access the coronavirus payment. That is on top of the people already on the JobSeeker payment. Australia is facing an unemployment rate which triples – which in people terms, is about two million people. About half of those are trying to get on the system for the first time. Hence the delays. The government has apologised for those waits – but only after the minister responsible for government services, Stuart Robert, tried to blame a DDOS attack. Turns out the MyGov system crashed for entirely legitimate reasons – people need help. People are already lining up outside Centrelink (now Services Australia) and the sun isn’t up. The national cabinet (the one with the premiers and the federal leaders) will meet again tonight, where things like childcare and the rental relief plan will be discussed. Localised lockdowns will also be on the agenda. The Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has already told residents to stay in their suburbs. In areas where there are breakouts of community transmissions, which are being seen in very early stages in places like Sydney and the Gold Coast, the governments are looking at putting in even stricter restrictions. But the supermarkets will remain open, so there is no need for panic buying. We’ll take you through all of it.

It’s possible to tour all five of them in a weekend. The larger two, Ponza and Ventotene, are lively and inhabited all year round. Palmarola only comes to life during summer when it offers simple accommodation. Santo Stefano and Zannone are desert isles, dominated by wilderness. Ponza It’s the main isle, shaped like a crescent moon, and roughly nine square kilometres. It is also très chic, so be prepared to bump into football players and royals. But if you avoid spending too much time on the main drag of Piazza Carlo Pisacane, with its fancy boutiques, and opt for the sea-dog lifestyle, there’s much to explore. It’s a labyrinth of orange-purple sea grottos, talcum powder-like beaches, white granite rocks and pirates caves where scuba divers still search for hidden treasures. One of Ponza’s many beautiful grottoes.

The best way to reach it is by kayak from Cala Feola bay (rentals starts at €25pp with guide for a three-hour tour). Popular Chiaia di Luna cliff, with its reddish-yellow layers, looks like a slice of Mars and is towards the south of the island, opposite the harbour. You can swim in Roman aqueducts, cisterns and fisheries at Pontius Pilate’s caves adjacent to the port, named after the Roman governor of Judea who loved to bathe here. More are dotted about the isle and were used by the Romans in the past to breed moray eels. After a day sunbathing, stroll along the picturesque ancient Roman harbour made of colourful fishermen dwellings and prehistoric grottos turned into studios, and where evening drinks are served on rooftops. Up on the hills, the area is dotted with colonial villas built by early settlers who were sent here in the 1700s by the Bourbon kings of Naples to colonise the isle.

This is the archipelago’s second-largest isle and is car-free, spartan and humble compared with Ponza. The laid-back vibe contrasts with its dark past: it was a jail for lustful Roman noble women and later on anti-fascists. Emperor Augustus shipped his daughter Julia here on charges of adultery and Nero exiled and sentenced to death his wife Octavia, so that he could marry Poppaea. Mosaics still cover the ruins of Julia’s villa at Punta Eolo. Centuries later, Mussolini confined his enemies here, including Altiero Spinelli, a European federalist and co-author of the Ventotene Manifesto.

The lounge cafe there, Mascalzone Village, is perfect for a quick lunch of aubergine pies and dishes of melon, ham and fresh buffalo mozzarella. The village can be noisy at night, so for somewhere quiet to stay the Parata Grande hotel (doubles from €130 half-board) is a good bet. It’s a former colonial villa surrounded by fields of lentils, and set atop the highest cliff on the island. The chef makes homemade barracuda-stuffed ravioli and octopus cocktails.

Wild goats graze on clifftops and there are ruins of a monastery, reachable through trekking routes. There’s nothing here, not even a bar.

Hopes that the country’s parliament might pass a budget on Wednesday provided some support, as did the continuing optimism that investors might rescue struggling Monte dei Paschi. If that does not happen, there was growing talk that a state bailout could take place this weekend. The idea that the bank would be recapitalised one way or another pushed the Italian banking index 9% higher, its best one day performance since 8 July. Monte dei Paschi itself added 1%, while Unicredit climbed 13%. Elsewhere Deutsche Bank jumped 8% while in the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland rose nearly 6% and Barclays 4.5%.

Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. 4.46pm GMT Back with Boeing, and Donald Trump’s tweet saying the company was charging too much to build the new Air Force One - $4bn - and should lose the contract. Boeing has now responded with a statement, saying: We are currently under contract for $170m to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer. Updated at 5.10pm GMT 4.13pm GMT Ratings agency Fitch has moved its outlook on Italian banks from stable to negative for 2017, in the wake of the referendum vote and worries about their ability to recapitalise. Fitch said: The Negative Outlook for the Italian banking sector reflects its increased vulnerability to shocks following the asset-quality deterioration in legacy portfolios... A step-up in pressure from authorities and market participants on the sector to reduce the very high levels of impaired loans has increased urgency and risks for Italian banks. Profitability in the sector is frail. Disposals of non-performing loan portfolios could lead to losses that require additional capital. These are some of the factors driving the 2017 Outlook to Negative from Stable. Problems for a small number of distressed banks raising capital have added to these pressures The “No” vote at the constitutional referendum has further heightened political uncertainty and possibly reduced the capacity to implement economic reforms. The risks from political instability were one factor that contributed to our revision of the Outlook on Italy’s ‘BBB+’ sovereign rating to Negative in October. The referendum result could also damage the recapitalisation plans of some Italian banks, most notably Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena and UniCredit, and have negative implications for the broader banking sector, whose attractiveness with investors has already reduced significantly during 2016. The sector’s ability to access the institutional markets for funding and capital, which has become more difficult and expensive this year, could deteriorate further... Significant disposals that materially improve asset quality could be positive for ratings. However, the disposals are likely to result in further provisioning and possibly more capital shortfalls for the banks involved. Portfolio sales could also result in risk-weighted assets rising for the remaining loans if the sales affect loss-given-default estimates at banks using internal rating models. Capitalisation will remain under pressure in 2017 with a weak earnings outlook limiting banks’ ability to build capital. Low interest rates, tepid economic growth and fierce competition for healthy borrowers are challenges for earnings. Profitability could also be dented by restructuring costs as banks focus on cost-cutting. We also believe regulators could require higher capital buffers from Italian banks to compensate for the risk in their large non-performing loan portfolios and for the large portion of Italian sovereign debt held. This could result in additional capital requirements at some banks. 3.58pm GMT The Italian referendum proved a non-event for markets, including emerging markets, because it had effectively been priced in, and at the same time suggested the European Central Bank might well extend its quantitative easing programme this week. So says David Rees of Capital Economics. But he adds: Nonetheless, the political situation in Italy, and indeed the rise of populism in Europe more generally, is something to keep an eye on in the months ahead. Italy’s economy and banking sector are weak, and if the Five Star Movement’s momentum continues to build, it may not be long before an exit from the euro becomes a more realistic concern for investors....Similar fears have rocked emerging market equities in the past, when the Greek debt crisis first came to the fore and Spanish and Italian bonds came under fire in 2012. 3.51pm GMT Italy’s banking sector continues to recover, helped by talk that the country’s parliament might approve its budget on Wednesday, and there could be a state bailout of troubled Monte dei Paschi this weekend. The country’s banking index is currently up more than 7%, its best daily performance since the middle of July. The overall European banking index is up 3%, hitting its highest level since the middle of January. 3.45pm GMT More fallout from Donald Trump’s election - this time affecting UK mortgage rates. Rupert Jones reports: The first evidence has emerged that the era of record-low fixed-rate mortgages may be coming to an end after HSBC withdrew its “cheapest-ever” deal and increased rates on other products. HSBC had been offering a mortgage that allowed customers to lock in for two years at a rate of 0.99%, but this deal has been pulled with immediate effect. The bank’s new mortgage offers are coming in at up to 0.5% higher. The move follows warnings from mortgage brokers that a number of factors, including Donald Trump’s US election win, were set to push up the cost of new fixed-rate home loans. David Hollingworth at broker London & Country Mortgages said: “The bottom of the market may have been hit. This [announcement] and the broader changes from HSBC, which has been very aggressively priced in the fixed-rate market, could spell the end of the sub-1% fixed rate, but also signals a potential turning point for fixed mortgage rates.” The full story is here: Related: HSBC raises mortgage rates and pulls 'cheapest-ever' fix 3.13pm GMT Donald Trump may be casting doubt on Boeing’s Air Force One order, but elsewhere US manufacturers are doing well. New orders for US factory goods rose 2.7% in October, the biggest increase for nearly a year and a half and just above expectations of a 2.6% improvement. The September figure was revised upwards from a gain of 0.3% to 0.6%. The latest figures mark the fourth straight month of increases. But there could be clouds ahead, given the strength of the dollar following Trump’s election victory. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: US factory orders surged... in October, providing manufacturers with plenty of optimism in what has been a turbulent year. Uncertainty surrounds the sector, though, amid renewed strength of the dollar and the incoming president’s trade policy, particularly his approach to China. Donald Trump’s promised fiscal stimulus and the increasing likelihood of raising interest rates has fuelled a greenback rally, and that could starve off exports and hit US factories hard in the new year. 2.52pm GMT And here’s a video clip of Donald Trump outlining his unhappiness with Boeing.

Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens For the first time since economic crisis engulfed Greece just over seven years ago, a sitting government in Athens has felt fit to describe a decision taken in Brussels as a “national success.” The positive spin and brave faces that have greeted the three bailouts rolled out for Greece, so far, have today been superseded by a genuine sense of relief at the announcement of short-term measures to lighten the country’s mountainous debt load. Many in Syriza, the governing left-wing party, said the move by euro zone partners to shave €45bn euros off the pile – the equivalent of 22 percent of GDP – by extending the repayment period and adjusting interest rates - exceeded “every expectation.” Addressing reporters today the government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos described the decision both as a “significant achievement” and “decisive step for the stabilisation of the Greek economy and complete restoration of confidence.” Riot police walk past the Greek parliament building today, during an anniversary rally marking the 2008 police shooting of 15-year-old student, Alexandros Grigoropoulos. Photograph: Alkis Konstantinidis/Reuters But as Greece’s political opposition was quick to point out the victory was bittersweet. This might be the first time that the nation’s unmanageable debt burden has been addressed head-on – and as such can only be seen as rich reward for prime minister Alexis Tsipras - but it comes against a backdrop of calls for Athens to adopt yet more austerity once its current bailout programme expires in mid-2018. Amid signs of a looming showdown with the International Monetary Fund, which says further belt-tightening is the only way to plug the looming fiscal gap and thus ensure its own participation in Greece’s third bailout to date, the spokesman called the demands “irrational.” Athens, he insisted, would neither accept the German proposal for Greece to achieve a primary surplus of 3.5 % through 2028 nor the IMF’s demands for extra measures in 2019 and 2020. Both are expected to dominate talks when auditors representing creditor institutions return to continue negotiating a second review of policy measures set as the price of bailout funds. “Greek society cannot endure more measures,” said Interior minister Panos Skourletis hinting at the battle that is brewing. “The Greek economy can’t endure them either.” Students shout slogans during the anniversary rally to remember Alexandros Grigoropoulos’s death.

She argues that closing some branches would help make the sector competitive, and free up capital for other uses: Italy has more bank branches than pizzerias, in the future it desperately needs more pizza and less banks! She also explains why Monte dei Paschi’s future matters, especially if its cash call fail this week. It’s certainly not as systemically important as other banks, for example Italy’s Unicredit, but Monte dei Paschi’s main problem is that it has become symbolic of Italy’s rotten banking sector that now relies on foreign capital for life support. If the Qatari’s decide against investing in it then it gives a terrible signal to the world about the ‘investability’ of Europe’s banks. Interestingly, in Europe it is not the systemically important banks that are the biggest risk to the financial sector, but the glut of mid-size banks that hold billions in bad debts that could endanger the health of the bigger banks in Europe, if contagion is to spread. .@KATHLEENBROOKS about Italy: \"In the future it desperately needs more pizza and less banks!\".

Ana Boata, economist at trade insurance firm Euler Hermes, believes 0.3 percentage points could be knocked off growth next year, taking the annual rate down from 0.9% to 0.6%. She predicts that foreign investment will be hit, and Italian firms could suffer high financing costs if their banks remain weak: While there is no need to panic, the resounding ‘No’ result and political turmoil that has followed could cause a mild confidence crisis in 2017. Even without any spill over to banks or the bond market, we expect -0.3pp of Italian GDP could be shaven off, leaving the economy with the prospect of a mere 0.6% growth next year. “It will be Italian companies that bear the brunt of a confidence shock, albeit a mild one, which are already contending with some of the worst cash flow conditions in the world – businesses are waiting on average for 88 days for payment for goods and services. We are likely to see divestment from abroad and tougher financing conditions mean that inward investment levels will stay flat, compared to 2% growth we previously predicted for 2017, and hamper the economy’s chances of recovery.” 10.48am GMT Bank shares rally on Italian bailout hopes European banking shares are rallying this morning, as traders look for silver linings in the Italian political upheaval. Almost every bank in the index of major European banks, the Stoxx 600, has gained ground. The prospect of Monte dei Paschi (-2.6%) receiving a dose of state aid this weekend is calming the markets, as this would remove the risk that it might simply collapse. The Stoxx 6000 this morning Photograph: Thomson Reuters Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, has taken his eye of his company’s plunging share price to explain all: One of the biggest worries surrounding the referendum was the impact it could have upon the nation’s banking system, with the likes of Unicredit and Monte dei Paschi in the midst of a recapitalisation and bank rescue plan. Plans to raise substantial funds at Monte dei Paschi have hit the buffers after the ‘No’ vote and while a likely government bailout may not be the ideal otucome for the bank, it will mitigate the risk of a collapse and contagion in the region, hence the widespread gains across the financial sector today. 10.32am GMT Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem has weighed in on Brexit this morning, warning that the UK’s demands are not compatible with a smooth exit from the EU.

It all depends whether Qatar can be persuaded to still back its €5bn cashcall, even though Italy has been plunged into political limbo. Here’s the key points. Bankers are running out of private-sector solutions for Monte dei Paschi di Siena and have told the Italian lender to prepare for a state bailout this weekend after prime minister Matteo Renzi was felled by a referendum defeat. While financial markets responded relatively calmly to the referendum result, people briefed on the situation said the political upheaval made it “more difficult” to secure a €1bn investment from Qatar on which Monte dei Paschi’s €5bn capital-raising plan hinges. Senior bankers fear that a failure to shore up the bank, which was the worst loser of this summer’s European bank healthcheck, could damage already jittery investor confidence about Italy’s overall banking sector, which is hobbled by €360bn of bad loans and weak profitability. JPMorgan Chase and Mediobanca, advisers to Monte dei Paschi, have been working with Pier Carlo Padoan, Italy’s finance minister, to persuade the Qatar Investment Authority to pump money into Italy’s third-largest lender. But hope is fading that they can secure a deal by this week’s deadline. Without the cornerstone investment from Qatar, the other parts of the complex plan to fill the bank’s €5bn capital shortfall are likely to collapse.

Intriguingly, this measure could (apparently) allow Rome to get much-needed capital into MPS without triggering European rules forcing some bondholders to take a hit. That would protect those families and pensioners who hold bank bonds. Here’s the story: Measures to allow state aid for Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena are ready but will depend on political developments in coming days, sources familiar with the matter said. The Tuscan lender is looking at the idea of a precautionary recapitalisation which would avoid the triggering of European bail-in rules, one source said. Monte dei Paschi needs to raise 5 billion euros ($5.38 billion) by the end of December to avoid being wound down, but investors are reluctant to back the cash call after Prime Minister Matteo Renzi lost a referendum on Sunday and pledged to resign. 8.35am GMT The agenda: Italy bank rescue in focus Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi arriving the Quirinale Palace to resign last night. Photograph: Ettore Ferrari/EPA Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Matteo Renzi’s defeat in Sunday’s Italian referendum continues to reverberate around Europe, even though the outgoing PM has agreed to stay on a little longer to get the country’s 2017 budget passed. Related: Matteo Renzi's resignation temporarily 'frozen' by Italian president The big worry, of course, is Italy’s banks - with their €350bn of non-performing loans and uncomfortably thin capital reserves. The City is watching to see if Renzi’s defeat has scuppered the plans to recapitalise these institutions using private money; potential investors could well have been scared away by the crisis in Rome. If these efforts fail, then Italy’s government may have to activate bail-in procedures, which would inflict losses on private bondholders. And in Italy, that includes many members of the public. As CMC’s Michael Hewson explains, the Italian banking sector is a serious worry: Any new government technocratic or otherwise is still faced with the unenviable task of either bailing in the Italian banking sector and wiping out a wave of Italian pensioners and savers, or defying Brussels and trying to bail the banks out with taxpayer’s money in contravention of new rules to protect taxpayers. As it is the recapitalisation plan for Monte dei Paschi di Siena is much more problematic now that Renzi has gone given the uncertainty that is likely to come next as we await the shape of any new administration. No one in their right mind is likely to invest in a bank that has already been bailed out three times in the last few years against such an uncertain political backdrop. One thing is certain the events of the last few days make it likely that we will see the ECB extend its asset purchase scheme by at least another six months, beyond March 2017 when they meet later this week. The wider stock markets, though, continue to be quite relaxed about the political situation in Italy. Most European indices rose yesterday, and traders are expecting a quiet morning today.

Once the chef at our nearby tavola calda (canteen-like eatery), he is now the proud owner of his own place a street away from our flat. Standing at Barberini’s sickle- shaped bar, with the clatter of cups and the fierce hiss of the coffee machine in the background, Donato has explained exuberantly how he makes lasagna, minestra and – most importantly – his excellent chicken or rabbit alla cacciatora. He has also told me a fair bit about his medical history and the renovation of his vintage car, all of which I have listened to attentively, while eyeing up the grappa on the top shelf. Related: Classic Roman pasta and chickpea broth | Kitchen Sink Tales Unlike some versions of this dish, which include tomato, onions and red peppers, Donato’s is simple and fragrant. Very good chicken is browned and then simmered until tender with white wine and a confetti of finely chopped rosemary, chilli and garlic, and the dish finished with a spoonful of vinegar and some olives. Just the thought of making this dish makes me happy – not just because any dish that calls for a glass of wine for the pan requires one for the cook, but because of the roaring scent rising up from the chopping board, the golden crust on the meat, the mighty whoosh the wine makes as it hits the pan, and the warm scent that fills the kitchen as the dish bubbles away. I am a rosemary lover, immensely fond of its sturdy, wild scent, all sap green and camphor, fearless of needles skewered between my teeth. This is why I am happy to live in Rome where it is often used with abandon, in soups, with meat and fish, on pizza with potatoes. For this dish I use a serious sprig; you could of course only use a needle or two. Dried rosemary is not a great idea here – in fact is it ever? Maybe you disagree. The vinegar may sound like an odd addition, but it works beautifully, sharpening the edges of the dish and making it bolder and more defined. My Sicilian almost-mother-in-law, who often finishes dishes with vinegar, would say the vinegar is la morte sua, which translates as “the death of it”, but in an entirely positive way. It is her family stories about cacciatora that remind me of its origins: hunter’s style – or in this case, hunter’s wife style, as it was zia (aunt) Maria who cooked the rabbit my zio Cecè brought home on his shoulder, adding rosemary pulled from the bushes that grow so voraciously in Sicily, and vinegar made from the family wine gone wild. When it comes to your panful, vinegar is of course optional, as are the olives. It is impossible to give precise timings, since so much depends on the meat. My butcher Roberta, who reassuringly makes her alla cacciatora in much the same way as Donato, says a battery animal will cook in significantly less time than a free-range one, it will also give out a heck of a lot more liquid. She also notes that while the meat is cooking you need to make sure there is enough liquid in the pan, and scrape the juices from the bottom of the pan into the gravy, which should cling to each piece. By the end the meat should be tender and flavoursome and surrounded by just enough flecked aromatic sauce. As with so many braises, it better made in advance then reheated, perhaps with another splash of wine. In Rome pollo alla cacciatora is a secondo – a second course – served after the pasta, with bread to fare la scarpetta – “do the little shoe”, or mop up the juices. Vegetables would come after as, for the most part, Italians prefer a sequence of small, defined courses. I do too. I am also just as happy to have the chicken beside a pile of really buttery mash – which is what we had last night – or boiled potatoes, polenta, or rice, or possibly green beans. As for the wine, working on the principle you are going to drink the rest of the bottle and that this is a Roman-ish version, use something from this part of Italy – maybe a dry, fragrant malvasia. But you probably know better than me. Whatever you drink, as the pan bubbles away, raise a cook’s glass to Donato. Pollo alla cacciatora (Hunter’s chicken) Serves 4 5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 1.5 kg chicken (a small one, jointed, or a mixture of legs and thighs) 2 garlic cloves 1 small chilli pepper, or good pinch of dried chilli A sprig of fresh rosemary Salt and black pepper 250ml white wine, plus extra if needed 1 tbsp red wine vinegar A handful of pitted black olives 1 Cut the chicken into about 12 pieces (I ask my butcher to do this). In a deep sauté pan with a lid, large enough to fit the meat in a snug, single layer, warm the olive oil over a medium heat. Add the meat pieces, skin-side down and cook until the skin forms a golden crust, then turn them over and do the same on the other side. This will take about 15 minutes. 2 While the meat is browning, chop the garlic, chilli and needles from the rosemary sprig very finely. Once the meat has browned, sprinkle with the chopped garlic, chilli and rosemary, season with salt and pepper, pour over the white wine, cover the pan and turn the heat down to low. 3 Cook the meat, turning from time to time, until the thighs feel very tender when prodded with a fork, and the meat is surrounded by thick gravy – 45–75 minutes depending on the chicken. If the pan seems a little dry, add a little more wine. 4 In the last minutes of cooking add the vinegar and the olives, stir, and cook for a minute more, before dividing between warm plates.","Id":"lifeandstyle/2016/feb/23/italian-chicken-stew-recipe-pollo-alla-cacciatore-rachel-roddy","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webTitle":"Rachel Roddy’s Italian hunter’s chicken recipe | A Kitchen in Rome","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/23/italian-chicken-stew-recipe-pollo-alla-cacciatore-rachel-roddy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/23/italian-chicken-stew-recipe-pollo-alla-cacciatore-rachel-roddy","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":1008,"webPublicationDate":"2016-02-23T13:00:12Z","id":"lifeandstyle/2016/feb/23/italian-chicken-stew-recipe-pollo-alla-cacciatore-rachel-roddy","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Milan local government bans traffic from city due to poor air quality","body":"The city of Milan was brought to a standstill on Monday after the local government barred all traffic within Italy’s fashion and business capital because of persistent poor air quality. The daily ban on all traffic from 10am to 4pm, which has been put in place until Wednesday, comes as a host of other measures are adopted across Italy to reduce air pollution, including in the town of San Vitaliano, near Naples, where the mayor has blocked the operation of wood-fired ovens that are normally used to make pizza. Related: Faecal attraction: mayor of Il Postino island refuses to close beach Rome also took steps to try to curb air pollution by issuing a nine-hour ban on all cars with odd-numbered registration plates on Monday, while even-numbered plates will be barred for nine hours on Tuesday. Poor air quality in many major cities has been blamed on the unseasonably warm and dry winter and, according to some experts, changes in high wind patterns. It has not rained for 50 days in many parts of the country, and Milan has reported that its air quality breached acceptable levels for 31 days as of last week. The news has elicited a sharp response from critics of Matteo Renzi’s centre-left government, including the head of the populist Five Star Movement, Beppe Grillo. On his blog, Grillo criticised the prime minister for fighting over half a percentage point of GDP and issuing “lightning decrees on a Sunday” to save failed banks, while allowing an industrial policy “from the 19th century” to remain in place.

The group estimated that about 84,400 deaths in Italy that year were related to air pollution, out of about 491,000 across the EU. The EEA also found in a report released early this year that, while Italy had satisfactory levels of air quality concerning sulphur dioxide and benzene, its concentrations of PM10 – a measurement of air pollution – reached unsatisfactory levels in more than 40% of monitoring stations. Measurements of ozone were exceeded in 93% of monitoring stations.

Vending machine that makes pizza from scratch angers Italian purists","body":"You can already get pizza delivered to your house or pop a frozen one in the microwave, but soon there will be an even faster way to get your hands on a slice of margherita, and it is making purists wince. Pizza twirlers and pizzeria owners in Italy have reacted with incredulity and disgust after an engineering professor in Padua announced he would unveil a vending machine that made the Italian staple from scratch in less than three minutes. “I will not eat this pizza,” said Enrico Famà, the director of Accademia Pizzaioli, a school that trains pizza-makers. “It is not something that is really a pizza.” The vending machine, to be unveiled on Saturday, is a collaboration between the engineering department of the University of Padua and a company called Sitos, which already has an automated pizza-maker on the market. The firm’s website says it is the only maker of a pizza vending machine that kneads the dough on the spot and uses fresh ingredients, unlike models that simply heat up an already finished product. “I can’t speak in details – there is some confidential stuff – but my group deals with the research of electro heat technologies,” said Fabrizio Dughiero, the professor behind the project. “It uses all fresh products, but to accelerate the process they have to use some other things. In any case, the flavour is very good,” he said. Dughiero predicts that such “high-quality vending machines” using fresh products will become ubiquitous. But, while engineers might like the idea, pizza experts are less enthusiastic. At Verbano Ventitre, an “enopizzoteca” that sells pizza by the slice in Rome, owner Alessandro Magnifico said the idea of automatic pizza went against nature. He added that he was fairly sure his grandmother would not approve, either. “We wait 72 hours for the dough to rest here,” he said. “We don’t use chemicals. The dough becomes full of air to make it light.” Now that spring had sprung and the temperature was rising outside, the restaurant would adjust its use of water and use ice to stop the pizza dough from rising too fast, he said. Magnifico added: “A machine like this will be wonderful all around Europe, but not in Italy. We are spoiled. We want to see the men massaging the dough.” At the Accademia Pizzaioli, Famà agreed, saying that 70% of a pizza’s “goodness” could be attributed to its dough. “If you let the dough rest for at least 24 hours, the pizza will be better, tender, more digestible,” he said. “When you mix flour and water it is like fresh meat, you can eat it after an hour but then your stomach has to do 100% of the work.”","Id":"lifeandstyle/2015/mar/13/dough-vending-machine-pizza-italy-padua-engineer","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webTitle":"Dough!

The name is a play on words, combining tramezzino (a triangular sandwich) and pizza. Unlike a calzone or panzerotto, the bread for a trapizzino is baked separately, then stuffed with a filling to order. Callegari’s innovation featured thick, triangular pieces of baked dough sliced open and filled with traditional Roman mains such as braised oxtail, tripe in tomato sauce, and chicken with peppers. It wasn’t revolutionary by global standards, but it was novel for Rome. And because it was rooted in traditional flavours and transformed main dishes into quick, portable, affordable snacks, the trapizzino was an immediate hit. Soon it eclipsed 00100’s pizza slices in popularity, and Callegari began travelling around Italy showcasing his invention. But it wasn’t until recently that the trapizzino had a shop of its own. The appropriately named Trapizzino opened in Piazzale di Ponte Milvio in northern Rome last December. Shortly afterwards, 00100 was closed and a second Trapizzino duly opened in its place. Numerous fillings sit in containers on a counter around the open kitchen. Classic Roman dishes are still available, but they have been joined by others such as the southern Italy-inspired burrata and anchovy filling and zighinì, a spicy Eritrean stew, a nod to Rome’s East African immigrants and a sign that Rome’s palate is slowly starting to try new flavours – and not just new formats like the trapizzino. • Via Giovanni Branca 88 (Testaccio), and Piazzale di Ponte Milvio 13 Katie Parla blogs about food at Parla Food","Id":"travel/2014/sep/27/foodie-traveller-rome-trapizzino-new-pizza","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webTitle":"The foodie traveller: Rome’s new take on pizza","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/sep/27/foodie-traveller-rome-trapizzino-new-pizza","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2014/sep/27/foodie-traveller-rome-trapizzino-new-pizza","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":261,"webPublicationDate":"2014-09-27T05:30:42Z","id":"travel/2014/sep/27/foodie-traveller-rome-trapizzino-new-pizza","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Unhappy Valentines: romantic holiday disasters","body":"Hitting rock bottom In 2004 I went on a two-week group holiday with some friends to Sidari in Greece. They were all couples and I was the only singleton so felt a bit left out. When I met a hot Greek waiter called Spiros (you couldn’t make this stereotype up!) on the third night, I fell for his charms and muscly arms. He was blonde, blue-eyed and very cute. We went on a couple of dates after he finished work during my first week then I thought, ‘what the hell - throw caution to the wind’ and decided to take things further. One night, drunk on ouzo, I invited him back to my apartment. He told me he’d finish work in an hour and would come over then. Dimming the lights, I put on my sexiest thong, black patent heels – and nothing else. When he walked in to find me draped sexily in the middle of the double bed his eyes lit up. “Come here,” I whispered, before suddenly falling through the bed. I hadn’t realised it was two singles pushed together and hit my naked backside on the concrete floor. All he could see was my arms and legs sticking out from the gap. I yelled at him to help me but he was laughing too hard. I was in agony afterwards – I’d fractured my coccyx – so instead of a night of passion, we ended up in A&E. I was given strong painkillers and told to lie on my side until my injury healed. I couldn’t drink on the painkillers, or walk very well, so I spent most of the rest of my holiday either sitting by the pool on a rubber ring, or in bed – alone. Nilufer Atik There were three in the bed … Sunset over the Mekong, Luang Prabang. Photograph: Leisa Tyler/LightRocket/Getty I proposed in Angkor Wat at dawn on my girlfriend’s birthday. We decided to celebrate by going on an early – pre-marriage – honeymoon to Luang Prabang. We’d save on the airfares if we did it now, I argued. We wafted around the gilded wats and the colonial villas of the ancient Laos capital for a couple of days in a fug of love. Then we got itchy feet and organised a three-day walking tour through the hill villages of the Hmong. Our marriage would start on an adventurous note. It was a disaster from the moment we entered the first village. We were to stay that night in the village chief’s hut. Only he didn’t appear to have been consulted. A bottle of local whisky was offered by our guide to smooth the way. We wanted to leave. It was too late and too far, he said. Our guide cooked us a meal in full view of all the village children who stared on in hungry anticipation. We didn’t have the heart to eat it and offered it as a buffet to the kids. We were led upstairs to bed, where a thin curtain had hastily been put up to separate us from the bed shared by the chief, his wife and their children. We didn’t think we could feel any more embarrassed but gritted our teeth and settled down for an uncomfortable night’s sleep. That’s when the guide arrived and asked me to budge up as he was coming in to join us. It was the only place to sleep, he said. In the morning, after he’d complained about my snoring, we asked for directions to the nearest road, and sprinted off in the direction he was pointing. Andy Pietrasik Sicily with the wrong bra Jude Clarke in her sexy honeymoon outfit! Photograph: Jude Clarke My new husband and I flew to Palermo for our long-saved-for, eagerly anticipated honeymoon. I had packed extra carefully, with specially purchased box-fresh clothes and all those treasured and irreplaceable items (best bra, effortlessly flattering dress, most reliable shoes). You guessed it: my suitcase never arrived. So I started my holiday of a lifetime in a pair of husband’s boxers and the grubby bra I’d flown in – not the kick-ass bikini I’d pictured. Plan B was soon activated: we’d cash our traveller’s cheques and go shopping. You only get one honeymoon, right? Right, except we managed to have our pockets picked. All our holiday money, along with my chance of gorgeous honeymoon clothes: gone. When we returned for our 10th anniversary, I took hand luggage only, and changed my outfit twice a day. Because I could. Jude Clarke Grim death in Tuscany Matilda Battersby and beau. Photograph: Matilda Battersby We wanted to get away from it all on our first trip abroad, so booked what looked like an idyllic cottage near a national park in Tuscany. We drove up tiny roads into the mountains, where the views were sensational, the evening lit by fireflies. Then we spotted our hideaway – a tumbledown building which had, we learned, been an abattoir. There was an unscrub-off-able atmosphere of death about it, and our only companions were ants (that ate our food), lizards and scary black scorpions. The floors had holes so big we could chat between storeys. The only saving grace – being on the edge of a brilliant mountain biking trail – turned sour when I cycled downhill too fast and ended up with a split chin that needed stitches. We drove a long way each day to escape our abbattoir – gelato and pizza made more romantic by the giant plaster on my face. We laughed – when it didn’t hurt my chin too much – and renamed it Sh-Italy. Matilda Battersby Blame the queen of hearts ‘This would be so beautiful if we were actually speaking to each other’ Photograph: Alamy It was 1997, the year Princess Diana died. I know that because her death was the reason for a big row on the first night of our “romantic” island holiday. We were in Manila on a one-night stopover before a flight to Boracay. Andy, my ex, said I was being “typically” cynical about the outpouring of grief from people who’d never met Diana. It got personal, and spiteful: relationship over. But, with flights booked, we had to continue our holiday. We sunbathed on stunning beaches, in silence. We snorkelled in clear waters, in silence. At night we sat in restaurants, sand between our toes, barely saying a word. One night I poured my heart out to the barman at a beachfront bar. I felt like I was in a film. Halfway through the week, someone stole my traveller’s cheques and I broke down. Andy did lend me some cash, but he didn’t comfort me as I cried myself to sleep. Beverley Fearis You’ve heard of Nordic noir … Bergen … but on a good day. Photograph: Getty Images As a honeymoon destination, Bergen, gateway to the fjords, sounded idyllic. We imagined a place where trolls frolicked in waterfalls, and we would feast on cinnamon buns. The reality was more like a wet week(end) in Wigan – if Wigan also had the highest food and alcohol prices in Europe. Bergen smelled of fish (we were vegetarians), there was little to do or see and the locals were grumpy. Worse, our honeymoon coincided with a brass band festival, so at every corner, our ears were assaulted by trombones playing When the Saints Go Marching In. It was July, but it rained – a lot. Like every single day. Our “cruise” around the fjords turned out to be six hours on a rickety tourist boat with no on-board refreshments. And we could see precisely nothing of Norway’s “wondrous landscape” through the impenetrable mist. We tried to escape, but the tour operator said we’d have to pay for new return flights. So we stuck it out. At least we’d been upgraded to a suite, so I could watch soaps dubbed into German on one TV, while my husband watched the World Cup on the other. And they say romance is dead. Hilary Freeman Whatever happened to baby Jane? ‘It didn’t look like this in the summer.’ Photograph: Martin Godwin June. It was hot and we’d just left school, so a gang of us bussed and hitched to Anglesey, invaded a Benllech campsite and spent two joyous weeks jumping off sea cliffs, boozing and chasing girls. I was particularly smitten with a local lass called Jane; my mate liked her friend Julia. I was in love. Going home was a wrench. We kept the dream alive with phone calls and flowery letters, and arranged to return as soon as we could afford it ... October in Benllech is different. Deserted except for a stiff onshore breeze. The campsite looked like the Falklands. We pitched our two-man tent on the same plot as before, and went in search of romance. The girls were not there as arranged. They were not in any of the usual haunts. Hours of enquiry yielded a solitary rumour: the girls were at a party and the love of my life was seeing a local quarry-faced dimwit called Siz. We returned to the now-dark campsite to find our tent and bags had been nicked and the contents distributed to the gales. I haven’t been back to Anglesey since. Dave Hall Miles apart in Portugal Never a barrel of laughs … Fado, Portugal’s heartbreaking folk music. Photograph: Alamy My fiance Michele and I met up in Lisbon to get over a rocky year living apart, but the holiday felt doomed from the start. On our first evening, we wandered in a daze of mutual misunderstanding through the city’s Barrio Alto. We stumbled into a Casa do Fado, where a black-shawled singer was performing fado, Portugal’s heartbreaking folk music. It was probably a bad omen. A couple of bottles of vinho verde later, we staggered back to our hotel room and collapsed into a sexless stupor. The next day we drove south along the coast. The beaches were out-of-season deserted but we could see only the bleakness. A night in a historic pousada made us more aware of the distance between us: the canopied bed was too much pressure. Back in Lisbon, we went through the motions of sightseeing. I gushed about the blue and white azulejos (tiles) and we ate bacalhau – or rather I did, submerging my sorrow in salted cod, while Michele left his cataplana (fish stew) untouched. While we were having a sad galão (milky coffee) before heading to the airport to catch separate flights to different homes, our hire car was towed away. Almost the last time we saw each other was in Lisbon’s distinctly unromantic car pound.

So far, so magical until, one evening, walking back to our bungalow, yours truly remembered that he still hadn’t carried his bride across the threshold. To much giggling from my lovely bride, I threw her over my shoulder. Harrison Ford has nothing on me. The thing about throwing people over your shoulder, though, is that they must land with their stomach, not their ribs. I misjudged the whole manoeuvre and managed to crack my wife’s rib. She didn’t leave me – in fact she was wonderfully gracious – but for the rest of the honeymoon there was a ban on making her laugh – too painful. And let’s just say lovemaking became a carefully choreographed dance. Sasha Damjanovski A fine Rome-ance Robert Hull with his wife on their honeymoon. Photograph: Robert Hull Rome could not have looked more romantic: the roads were quiet, the Colosseum and the Forum were illuminated on our bus ride from airport to hotel in the early hours. The half-a-day’s wait in the departure lounge was behind us. It would be the perfect weekend for me to propose. Romance would reign. On our first evening, we sat in a bar, glancing at football on the TV. My proposal had been greenlit, we were going for a meal and tomorrow we’d be at the Stadio Olimpico watching Roma vs Lazio, the rousing Rome derby. I stopped at an ATM. My card was refused. Another ATM, another refusal. No problem … I had a credit card. At the end of the meal the waitress said the restaurant was cash-only. My fiancee paid. As we left, my bank called. “Someone may be using your card. In Rome.” “It’s me.” “It may not be you.” “I’m pretty sure it’s me.” “We think it’s better to cancel your card.” In the hotel bar, the TV ran the result of the Roma-Lazio game. My rubbish Italian had Sabato and Domenica mixed up so we’d missed the game. At the airport our fortunes changed: we got an earlier flight home. Sadly, our luggage didn’t make the same trip. Thirteen years later we got married. Romance reigned. Or maybe not … on the first day of our honeymoon to Iceland our flight was delayed by nine hours and we waited for it at Gatwick’s Yotel … in separate bunkbeds.

I had been misty-eyed over a slightly sporty colleague. We had moved on to flirting, and summer plans. His joining me on my holiday filled me with quiet hope. On day two a jellyfish stung my face. It wasn’t so much a sting as an emblazoning, sealing one of my eyes and puffing up the surrounding area. Where some might have felt protective, I just caught revulsion on the face of my innamorato. We were confined to our hotel terrace, my forehead and chin swathed in bandages, his face wrapped in uneasy, trapped concern. I fed myself ice-creams through the gaps. The lavish care of our guide, who escorted me on hospital visits, revealed the couple we were not. We flew home early. “We” were not to be.

A rather tragic conversation with the hotel staff as to why it was my mum with me and not the man on the reservation added insult to injury. Lucy Dixon An ill-advised ‘joint’ venture ‘Don’t do it!’ Photograph: Alamy My boyfriend and I booked an 11-night make-or-break holiday in Agadir, intending to base ourselves at the hotel but travel around to see Marrakech and Essaouira. On arrival we discovered my credit card (Amex) wasn’t accepted by the car hire companies – so we had to almost exhaust our cash and ask friends to wire through more. A mountainous 10-hour journey to Marrakech along one of the “world’s worst roads”, littered with accident debris, and I nearly died of fright every time we turned a corner. When we discovered we could have taken an alternative route, we had a massive row. On our penultimate night, my boyfriend managed to procure some Moroccan hash. I’m not a smoker, but thought I would try it. I had one spliff and spent the next few hours having what must have been an awful trip. My last words – before I passed out – were: “I just want to go home and be with my mum.” We soon split up, but seven years later he got back in touch. And 16 years on from that fateful trip we went on our honeymoon – to Marrakech. He paid for everything, including the car hire, and I didn’t have to book a thing.

My new partner was separated and I was his first girlfriend since the split. His nine-year-old daughter back at home was not impressed, nor was the ex-wife, particularly when he told them of our impending trip. All started well as we pulled out of Luxor and began steaming down the river. The call to lunch interrupted our passion. In the dining room he was greeted by a nine-year-old girl, his daughter’s best friend, who looked at me quizzically. We tried to avoid her probing questions with comments about how exciting it was to see the temples on the banks of the river. Unfortunately, she was not easily distracted and took surreptitious photographs of us at every opportunity, texting them to the daughter at bedtime. Any chance of sharing beautiful sunsets or cosy cuddles was destroyed by the juvenile spy and the constant reminders of who had been left at home, and my irritation was the death knell of the relationship. We sat separately on the flight home and shook hands at Gatwick. Taniaz Greek tragedy ‘I can’t go out there. I’m staying in my room’ Photograph: Alamy I was 19 and head over heels in love with my university boyfriend, who was 21. We got a last-minute holiday to Greece. Just the two of us, in the hot Greek sun, no one and nothing to invade the bubble of our mutual obsession. Until the first day, when I gleefully ran out into the blazing sun and he announced that he was basically allergic to sunshine and usually his mum would build him a “nest” of wet towels to hide under. Took me a while to process why he thought a holiday to Greece in August was a good idea. What followed was a week of me resentfully dunking towels in the pool and draping them over a sun umbrella, so that he could scamper out of the hotel and dive into his Gollum cave. He also objected to me sunbathing topless. He asked me recently (I’m now aged 32) if I’d ever thought about getting back together. It was a firm no from me. KMD A weekend with a kleptomaniac ‘We didn’t order this wine’ Photograph: Alamy I met James when he was in my home town visiting friends. We hit it off and he invited me to come and visit him for the weekend in Auckland. On the first day he stole a postcard from a gift shop. Then we had lunch at a fish market and two glasses of wine mysteriously appeared on our tray. It got progressively worse. We went grocery shopping and afterwards he opened his coat and stuffed inside were brie cheese, gourmet chocolates, grapes and other items. I confronted him about his stealing and he gave me a lecture about how he liked to “Stick it to the man.” The kleptomania reached its final shameful heights when we visited a small family-run honey farm on our last day. He tried to get past the cashier without paying for the most expensive medicinal honey jar they sold. She was on to him though, and made him cough up. I was so embarrassed and furious we drove back to the airport in silence. I deleted him from Facebook on the plane home. Messy Hair A ‘short cut’ back to Avignon ‘Oooh, he’s got such a great sense of direction’ Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo Avignon, 2011, our first holiday. We peered at the map from the bicycle-hire shop. Even a low-skilled map reader like me could see there was insufficient detail. I gazed at A, admiring his confident sense of direction. We wobbled on ill-fitting bicycles to Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Free samples of it. Everywhere. It grew dark. Time to go back. We argued about the squiggly map. I followed A, whose back light was broken. The road was wide and fast with blaring horns. Not a road. A motorway. The wrong squiggle. Back in Avignon we were shaken, glad to be alive. Imagining ourselves as roadkill. Our en suite toilet became blocked and unignorable. A certain passion-killer. The next morning we discovered both bikes had been stolen. We’re still together.

Surely, I hear you scoff, no one could go wrong arranging tomatoes, basil and mozzarella on a plate? But before you decide that silly season has pitched its parasol on the food pages, think back to all the caprese salads you have had, and, if you live in Britain, you’ll realise it is indeed possible to ruin this Italian classic. According to Angela Hartnett: “While [it] appears on menus everywhere, very few places make it well.” Mostly, of course, this is down to ingredients; if you’ve only got “cheap, rubbery mozzarella and watery, chilled tomatoes”, as Hartnett puts it, you should probably make something else instead, but even the best raw material still requires careful handling. It’s not a question of tweaking – as J Kenji Lopez-Alt puts it on US site Serious Eats: “Working on a recipe for caprese salad is kind of like working on updating the Beatles’ classic If I Fell. It’s so damn near-perfect already, where is there to go with it?” Angela Hartnett’s caprese salad. Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian A caprese doesn’t need quinoa, strawberries or even, God forbid, kale. Lopez-Alt puts it perfectly when he says: “A good caprese salad is a culinary endpoint. Like a Neapolitan pizza or a good old American hamburger, it’s a dish that’s so well conceived, so balanced, so downright delicious in its most common incarnation, that to improve upon it by changing its basic form or structure is simply impossible.” No, it just needs to be faultless, and that’s this week’s mission. The tomatoes Lacking Capri’s sun-kissed climate, high summer is the only time of year you should consider making a caprese in Britain – although even then Hartnett is dubious, writing in her book Cucina that “the quality of the tomatoes in the UK is often pretty poor, so at the Connaught we roast the tomatoes in order to concentrate the flavour”. For good measure, she chucks on a very generous amount of sugar, plus some thyme and garlic, and slow-roasts them for two hours, until they’re sweet enough to eat like candy. If you can only get hold of orange, watery fruit, then hers is definitely the best approach, but in season, it seems a shame to sacrifice the natural acidity of a ripe tomato in favour of this richer, jammier flavour. (As an aside, talking to the specialist greengrocers Natoora last week, I was informed that you could tell a good quality tomato by its seeds: they should be jellied, rather than watery, and it should feel heavy for its size.) Christopher Boswell uses semi-green tomatoes. Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian Interestingly, Christopher Boswell, executive chef at the Rome Sustainable Food Project, and author of the book Verdure, explains that: “In southern Italy, caprese is almost always served with semi-green tomatoes, and this is intentional. Unripe tomatoes … have higher acidity than juicy red slicing tomatoes. Buffalo milk mozzarella is quite rich, and if served with a ripe sweet tomato and with sweet basil, the dish can just fall flat. A more acidic varietal, or the acidity of a slightly under-ripe tomato brings out the distinct flavour of each ingredient in the dish.” His caprese is crunchy and refreshingly sour – quite a different dish to one made with fully ripe tomatoes. My testers enjoy it while also regretting the loss of sweetness, so I think a mixture of different varieties is ideal if you can find them. Saveur magazine suggests combining big beefy berthas and little cherry or grape tiddlers, while Jamie Oliver simply recommends “good mixed ripe tomatoes of different shapes and sizes”, which just about covers it, although try and include some tarter or greener ones in there if you can. Greengrocers, farm shops and markets should have a decent selection in August if you don’t grow your own. Russell Norman’s book Polpo contains a recipe that starts by sprinkling the tomatoes with salt “to pull on the juices” before putting the salad together, a step that really seems to bring out their flavour, as well as creating an instant and intensely tomatoey dressing. Saveur suggests combining beefy berthas with cherry tiddlers. Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian Mozzarella To be honest, before soft, tangy fresh mozzarella came into my life I was pretty happy with the milky vacuum-packed variety. Sadly, now I know better and it’s impossible to go back. You don’t need a lot here, so splash out on the good stuff. Saveur suggests burrata instead, which is mozzarella’s blingier, cream-filled cousin – undoubtedly decadent, and undoubtedly delicious, but too blandly rich here for my testers, who miss the lactic sourness of straight mozzarella. Tear it, as Oliver suggests, rather than cutting it into uniform slices. It’s easier to dot around the salad, and looks, as he says in Jamie’s Italy, more rustic, which is rarely a bad thing in a salad. Russell Norman’s caprese. Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian The basil Another revelation last week – I finally realised why so many chefs, including Hartnett, Boswell and Saveur, call for basil “ideally with small leaves”. Genovese basil, which is the proud holder of a European protected designation of origin, has tiny leaves, and an intensity of fragrance and flavour that makes it almost unrecognisable for those of us used to the standard sort. It’s so sweet it’s almost clove-like. That said, it’s also pretty expensive, and fiendishly hard to get hold of – and even the ordinary stuff is pretty good, especially if you save the larger leaves for pesto. Oliver makes his into a “lovely smashed basil dressing” by grinding it up in a pestle and mortar with a good pinch of salt and some olive oil. It looks pretty, but the herb seems to lose some of its potency, which is a shame, so I’d mess about with it as little as possible. Jane Baxter and John Vincent add shallot and garlic. Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian The extras Oliver adds a little finely chopped spring onion to the mix, while Jane Baxter and John Vincent’s Leon Happy Salads opts for shallot and garlic; both excellent things with tomato, but they rather overpower the mozzarella, as does Saveur’s balsamic vinegar. Indeed, a debate rages as to whether vinegar, also used in various iterations by Baxter and Vincent, and Oliver, has any place in a caprese at all. Marcella Hazan, the grande dame of Italian food writing in the US, writes that, “in the classic caprese, there is no vinegar, but Victor [her husband] insists it is a required part of the juices in his version” – so clearly there’s some leeway. If you have a good mix of different tomatoes, however, including some sharper varieties, then I don’t think vinegar is really necessary, so taste before adding. Decent olive oil, however, is non-negotiable. Finally, make sure all the ingredients are at room temperature before you start – not that you should be refrigerating your tomatoes or basil anyway. Perfect caprese salad. Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian (serves 4 with bread) About 600g tomatoes of different shapes and sizes, including some slightly under-ripe or more acidic varieties Extra virgin olive oil 250g buffalo mozzarella Small bunch of basil, preferably with smallish leaves Cut the tomatoes into different sized slices and chunks depending on their size and shape – large craggy fruit often looks better cut into cross sections. Cut out the core if it looks chewy. Put into a bowl and sprinkle with sea salt, leave to sit for 10 minutes, then add 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil and gently toss with a couple of spoons. Arrange the tomatoes on a platter, spooning over their juices. Tear the mozzarella over the top, and scatter with torn basil leaves. Drizzle with more oil and season with a little more salt. Serve.

Many of his “Italian style” films, the majority of which had ambivalent main characters played by Marcello Mastroianni, Vittorio Gassman and Nino Manfredi, take place against a background of historic events. Typical was Scola’s first international success, We All Loved Each Other So Much (C’eravamo Tanto Amati, 1975), in which three men from different backgrounds have been bound by their friendship for 30 years since they met as partisans in the second world war. The lives of Antonio (Manfredi), a good-natured, politically active proletarian; Gianni (Gassman), a bourgeois opportunist, and Nicola (Stefano Flores), a radical intellectual film buff, are paralleled by the events and the history of Italian cinema over the years. In this moving and amusing humanistic study of friendship, there are extracts from films by Michelangelo Antonioni, Roberto Rossellini, Luchino Visconti, Federico Fellini and Vittorio De Sica (to whom the film is dedicated). We All Loved Each Other So Much, 1975, directed by Ettore Scola Scola, whose parents were actors, was born in Trevico in the southern province of Campania. He studied law in Rome, but was more interested in drawing satirical cartoons. After dropping out of university, he joined the humorous magazine Marc’ Aurelio as a cartoonist, and there he got to know Fellini, who was on the editorial board. This connection helped Scola enter the film business as a writer of dozens of screenplays for broad Italian comedies from 1952 to 1964. Scola’s best scripts were for Dino Risi, whose comic style he assimilated as director. Let’s Talk About Women (Se Permettete Parliamo Di Donne, 1964), his first film as director, was a series of sketches (a form fashionable in Italy at the time) featuring the versatile Gassman in nine different roles. In Jealousy Italian Style, aka The Pizza Triangle (Dramma della Gelosia, 1970), Mastroianni, as a young communist bricklayer, leaves his wife for Monica Vitti. All is bliss until she falls for his waiter friend, played by Giancarlo Giannini. In this contribution to that Italian genre which uses dark, melodramatic plots to create comedy, Scola manages to achieve delightful moments of political and social satire. Ettore Scola at the World Film festival in Montreal, Canada, in 1999. Photograph: Pierre Roussel/Getty Images After the triumph of the sensitive We All Loved Each Other So Much, whose theme, expressed by one of the characters was “We thought we’d change the world, instead the world has changed us”, Scola entered the realm of grotesque comedy with Down and Dirty aka Ugly, Dirty and Mean (Brutti, Sporchi e Cattivi, 1976). It focuses on a large family, headed by the ageing one-eyed Giacinto (Manfredi), living in squalor in one rat-infested room in a shanty town on the outskirts of Rome. Scola treats his poverty-stricken characters far less kindly than the directors of the Italian neo-realist movement, who saw the poor as innocent victims of a brutal system. No less critical of a system that breeds poverty, Scola shows its degrading effects in graphic, scatological detail, yet keeping an ironic distance. “Grotesque humour is a noble and tragic way of representing contemporary problems,” Scola claimed. In contrast, A Special Day (Una Giornata Particolare, 1977) told of two lonely residents of a seedy apartment building who are drawn together on the day in 1938 when the populace in the streets is cheering Hitler’s visit to Mussolini in Rome. Most of the appeal of this Oscar-nominated downbeat drama is the casting against type of Sophia Loren as a frumpish housewife, and Mastroianni as a depressed gay man. The film stresses how repression can be a common bond between two very different people. Passion of Love (Passione d’Amore, 1981), set in 1862, had an army captain (Bernard Giraudeau) transferred to a frontier post, where he meets a neurotic woman (Valeria D’Obici). To his horror, she conceives a hopeless passion for him, thus drawing him into a fatal web of pity and obligation. The film was the basis of the 1994 Stephen Sondheim musical Passion. This was followed by another successful period piece, That Night in Varennes (La Nuit de Varennes, 1982). During 1791, the French king and queen flee across the country in a coach that is finally captured by the people of Varennes. Observing them is a collection of people who include Casanova (Mastroianni), well past his prime, and the American revolutionary Tom Paine (Harvey Keitel). The group spends the journey engaged in philosophical discussion and commentary on life, love, politics and history – which is about to sweep several of them away in the revolution. The handsome film, glitteringly cast, is mounted in the style of an ambitious pageant and directed with finesse. One nice touch is that all that is seen of the ill-fated Louis and Marie Antoinette are their lower legs and feet. Le Bal (1984), which gained another Oscar nomination, followed events in France from 1936 to the present day as reflected inside a ballroom by the changing music and the characters who frequented the place over the years. Behind the decor and the caricature performances, one senses the pain of real events, underlined by the music. Films speak in many ways: Le Bal manages to say a lot without a single line of dialogue. Another Oscar-nominated film, The Family (La Famiglia, 1987), was a portrait of a bourgeois Italian family seen through the eyes of an old retired professor, over a period of 80 years, all the action of which takes place in the same apartment. Scola retired in 2003, stating that while Silvio Berlusconi was in power every film made in Italy was touched by some of his money. However, in 2013, he made How Strange to be Named Federico (Che Strano Chiamarsi Federico), an affectionate semi-documentary on his friend Fellini. He is survived by his wife Gigliola, and his daughters Silvia and Paola, both writers. • Ettore Scola, film director, born 10 May 1931; died 19 January 2016","Id":"film/2016/jan/26/ettore-scola","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webTitle":"Ettore Scola obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/26/ettore-scola","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2016/jan/26/ettore-scola","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts","wordcount":1024,"webPublicationDate":"2016-01-26T13:18:00Z","id":"film/2016/jan/26/ettore-scola","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Rachel Roddy’s pasta and potatoes recipe","body":"Pasta e patate has saved our lunch and dinner more times that I care to remember. Yet far from being a weary last resort, which it can be, it is still one of my favourite things to make, to serve, to eat. I was taught to make it by my friend Ezio, a gently opinionated Calabrian who cooks for his large family, and however many visitors happen to be around, calmly and extremely well. Like most things Ezio cooks, his pasta e patate is simple: onion, carrot, a celery stick, a couple of potatoes, lots of very good olive oil (which is of course key), and some pasta. I admit to having been wary as he began chopping, for as much as I love both pasta and potatoes, I did wonder about the double-starch beigeness of it all. Wariness soon faded. The beauty of this dish is the way the potato collapses, giving you a slightly thickened broth in which you cook pasta. The starch of the pasta then thickens everything further. Black pepper and grated cheese jolt everything nicely to finish. Nothing clever here, nor impressive: just a pleasing, satisfying bowlful. Related: A peperonata recipe straight from Rome | Kitchen sink tales As with most home cooking, anarchic by definition, there are infinite variations and opinions about how to make this dish. However, unlike discussions about carbonara and amatriciana, which can get fierce, discussions about pasta e patate and other minestre (thick Italian soups/stews) are mostly gentle. My partner Vincenzo suggested that this is because, for many Italians, this sort of minestra, dished up from the pan, is the embodiment of childhood nourishment, transporting them to another time, maybe. Gentle opinions, but opinions nonetheless. A friend from Bologna adds meat broth instead of water, a homemade or a very good stock cube, which produces an altogether bolder dish. A Neapolitan friend likes the soffritto reinforced with guanciale, the final panful enriched with provola cheese for a consistency so firm that the spoon almost stands to attention. The addition of herbs, although not original I am sure, is my idea. I like rosemary, the classic Roman sidekick for potatoes (on pizza, or with roast lamb) whose strident sap-green, piney flavour works incredibly well. In the absence of rosemary, bay gives a nice musty note. As for garlic, some people like to add a clove, two even, chopped in with the soffritto, or smashed and then pulled out once it has lent its scent – you will know better than me on this one. One thing I will stress the importance of is the extra virgin olive oil, with its grassy scent and seductive mix of butteriness and bitterness. It really is the fragrant foundation of this dish, and then brings out the flavours of other ingredients. Treat it as a key ingredient rather than an afterthought, seek out the good stuff with a specific provenance. Somewhere in Italy makes sense here, but if you find a better Greek or Spanish one then opt for that (rather than a poor mass market brand that comes from goodness knows where). True, a bottle of good extra virgin olive oil for, say, £10 or £12 ($20) is an expense whether you’re in Italy or further afield, but it is an investment in something that will transform the taste of your food. We have a pretty strict budget, so I forsake lots of other things in order to have good extra virgin olive olive oil, ideally from Sabina in Lazio or southern Sicily. Taking the lead from home cooks and teachers I trust, I use it liberally for everything – sautéing, frying, dressing, doing my split ends, buffing the wooden table... As I said, nothing complicated here, ingredients you will most likely have in the fridge. It is the sort of dish you could get going the minute you walk through the door while you still have your coat on. It them simmers away, warming the kitchen and scenting it with rosemary, while you get yourself sorted. This is an occasion to spezzare – break spaghetti into 3cm-ish bits – which always feels a slightly rebellious act, but I should probably get out more. Once you have added the broken bits, or other pasta, you need to keep an eye on the pan, stirring so it doesn’t stick, checking you have a consistency you like. Pasta e patate is best if you let it sit for a few minutes so the flavours settle, after which have spoons at the ready for some good, beige comfort. Pasta and potatoes (pasta e patate) Treat this as a set of guidelines rather than strict instructions. When it comes to the detail, you know better than me. ‘Pasta e patate is simple: onion, carrot, a celery stick, a couple of potatoes, lots of very good olive oil.’ Photograph: Rachel Roddy/The Guardian Serves 4 1 onion 1 stick of celery 1 medium carrot A sprig of rosemary or 2 bay leaves 2 medium potatoes (about 600g of any kind) 6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 1.4 litres water or light stock of some sort 170g pasta (quadrucci, pastina, farfalle, or broken spaghetti) Salt, black pepper and pecorino or parmesan 1 Peel the onion and carrot and then dice along with the celery. Peel and cut the potato into chunks. Warm some olive oil in a heavy-based pan over a medium-low heat, then fry the onion, carrot and celery (along with a pinch of salt) until soft and translucent. Add the bay leaf/rosemary and the potatoes and fry, stirring so each cube is coated with oil for a couple more minutes. 2 Add the water and another small pinch of salt, bring to a lively simmer and then reduce to a gentle simmer for 15 minutes or until the potato is very soft – you can break it up slightly with back of a wooden spoon. Add the pasta, raise the heat slightly and cook for another 10 minutes or so or until the pasta is cooked, stirring and adding a little more water if it looks to be getting too thick. Taste for salt (remembering you are probably going to add salty cheese) and grind over some black pepper. Serve with some grated pecorino or parmesan stirred in, or simply a streak of olive oil.

He told Guardian Australia that the competition was very tough. “I was happy to get into the top five, so to end up number one is a fantastic achievement for me and also for Australia,” he said. “It lets the rest of the world know we do produce quality product here in Australia.” Di Francesco said his secret was Italian-imported flour, high-quality buffalo mozzarella and fresh basil. “People underestimate the margherita,” he said. “They think it’s the easiest pizzas to make, but it’s one of the hardest. Because it has so few ingredients, you can taste the quality of the dough used. With other pizzas, you can mask that with toppings.”","Id":"lifeandstyle/2014/apr/14/melbourne-worlds-best-margherita-pizza-wins","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webTitle":"Home of the world's best margherita pizza?

Italian","body":"When you think about learning Italian, visions of beaches, pizza, gelato and elite fashion spring to mind. But Europe’s language of romance offers benefits far beyond tourism. Italian has been identified by the British Council as one of the 10 languages most important to the UK over the next 20 years. It’s the official language of the EU, and the fourth most requested language by employers. Despite its attractions, the numbers taking the subject are tiny. In popularity it ranks behind French, German and Spanish – with exam entries of only 5,000 compared with 150,000 a year in French. So, with English primary schools now obliged to teach languages to seven- to 11-year-olds, what better way to ignite interest than by introducing the language of pasta and Pinocchio to your young charges? This week on the Guardian Teacher Network we have a selection of ideas and resources to help your students develop a love of Italian. At key stage 2, the focus of study in modern languages is on practical communication. Start by teaching students some basic greetings such as “hello”, “goodbye” and “how are you?” with the help of these flashcards by Seeme Resources. Cut them into cards and use them for a game of snap, with players saying the words as they place them down. Or give each student a card and ask them to move around the classroom until they find someone with an appropriate response. Songs and rhymes are a great way of exploring the patterns and sounds of another language. These flashcards help students learn the numbers one to 10 in Italian, and you can reinforce this by singing songs such as “One, two, three, four five; Once I caught a fish alive” with the English numbers replaced by Italian. Expand on students’ learning with the help of Light Bulb Languages, a site packed with language resources for French, Spanish, German and Italian for all ages. For key stage 3 students, check out these PowerPoint presentations to help pupils explain how they are feeling and what subjects they like at school. Print out the slides to create a quick and colourful wall display, or challenge groups to create their own presentations on a topic of their choice. Make language learning relevant for secondary students by using news reports such as these articles in Italian by The Day, a current affairs website for schools. Use this piece about the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall or this one about elections in Greece to start a discussion about European history and politics in Italian. Alternatively, provide students with the English version of the Berlin Wall article or the Greek elections piece and ask them to create their own Italian versions. How do their translations compare with those by The Day? Useful topics to consider when looking at Italy in the news could include football, travel and food and drink. Students keen on greater interaction and more use of technology when learning languages will enjoy the Molto Bene Italian language app. It features almost 80 lessons based on real-life situations including dining out, shopping, exploring and meeting new friends. There are useful sound files for thousands of words and interactive games to reinforce learning. The Guardian Teacher Network has a collection of grammar charts that can be used alongside the app. These cover definite articles, indefinite articles, subject pronouns, direct object pronouns, indirect object pronouns and prepositional pronouns. Another good resource is the Guardian’s phrasebook, which has a helpful section on pronunciation and basic grammar. Topics covered include shopping for clothes, going to the cinema and talking about the economy. Developing students’ cultural understanding is a key part of language learning. With this in mind, you might want to take a look at the Euroclub website. It provides information, activities, songs and resources related to French, Spanish and Italian language and culture. We also have interactive whiteboard resources about the human and physical geography of northern Italy and southern Italy suitable for use at key stage 4. Other handy resources for primary students include these word and picture cards about the seasons, colours and parts of the body by Twinkl. Encourage kids to use their new vocabulary in games such as Hangman or I Spy. We also have Italy-themed page borders, which are great for displaying students’ work, and a rainbow-themed colouring sheet. For more ideas to liven up language lessons, see these How to teach articles on French, German, Spanish, Chinese, the European Union, and teaching languages creatively.

It was a mix of recipes: my mum’s (no doubt inspired by Elizabeth David and Jane Grigson), Claudia Roden’s, Anna del Conte’s, The River Cafe’s and even that of a friend’s Calabrian girlfriend. I was – I fancied – almost Italian because I used tomato sauce in as many ways as I could. Then I moved to Italy and discovered a world beyond tomato sauce. I was even made to feel slightly embarrassed by my love of red sauce – especially anglicised red sauce. For a while, tomato sauce was sidelined. Then I settled in Rome with a Sicilian – the grandson of a tomato farmer, no less – a man for whom salsa di pomodoro is a way of life, or rather a way of lunch. He didn’t turn his nose up at the way I made sauce (rather a lot of onion, carrot and celery back then), he simply nodded in approval, twisted his fork and ate. Everyone has their own recipe for tomato sauce, shaped by taste, influences and practice. This, my big batch sauce, is influenced by Sicilian salsa, sugo I’ve eaten here in Rome and also by being back in England regularly and wanting an accommodating sauce that also works when I can’t get hold of a glut of gorgeous fresh tomatoes. The sauce can be adjusted according to the season: all tinned in winter, more fresh in summer, tweaked with salt, chilli and sugar. Like so many Italian recipes, it is open to improvisation, so treat this as a template, not a prescription. That said, I will be prescriptive about the quantity of olive oil: don’t skimp. And buy the best tinned plum tomatoes you can. Related: How to grow your own tomatoes | Make your own As to how to use this pan of sauce, we are suggesting spaghetti, pizza, eggs and beans. Of course you might – like us – eat pasta with tomato sauce for all four meals, which is fine too. The other beauty of this sauce is how well it keeps (a week in the fridge). Also, if at any point you think basta (enough) sauce, it freezes brilliantly. The last bit of advice is from my almost-mother-in-law: the sauce should cook at the sort of gentle simmer that has you peering under the pan to see if the flame has gone out, until a red burp on the surface reassures all is well. For the tomato sauce Makes 2 litres (approx) 100ml olive oil 3 garlic cloves, peeled, split but whole 750g fresh tomatoes, roughly chopped A pinch of salt A pinch of dried chilli flakes 2 x 800g tins of plum tomatoes in juice (ideally san marzano) Sugar, to taste 1 In a large, heavy-based pan, over a medium-low flame, warm half the olive oil and the garlic you have peeled and crushed with the back of a knife so it splits but remains whole. Let the garlic fry gently for a few minutes until it is pale gold and fragrant – it mustn’t brown or it will taste bitter. You can now remove the garlic if you like. 2 Add the fresh tomatoes and a good pinch of both salt and dried chilli flakes. Let the pan simmer uncovered for 10 minutes. 3 Use scissors to roughly chop the tomatoes in their tins, then tip them into the pan along with the rest of the olive oil. Reduce the flame to very low and let the sauce simmer gently, uncovered, for 45 minutes, squashing the tomatoes against the side of the pan with a wooden spoon from time to time. 4 Take the pan off the heat, taste and adjust seasoning (if the sauce seems a bit sharp, you can add a teaspoon or so of sugar). If you like a smoother sauce, pass it through a food mill, or blend in short, cautious blasts with a hand blender (too fast and it will turn into a pinky foam.) The hearty brunch: eggs in sauce White souls being cleansed in the red flames of purgatory is the image conjured up by this dish of eggs baked in tomato sauce – for my Neapolitan friend at least, who calls it ova ‘mpriatoro. My Sicilian partner calls it uova in salsa. I call it eggs in sauce, my son eggs rosse. While names are debated, we all agree it is a delicious dish. You could well get a bit obsessed with reducing the sauce to the ideal consistency and catching that precise moment the white soul is set, but the yolk still runny enough to bleed like a desert sunrise into the sauce. Bread or toast is essential. The peppers are optional, as is the pinch of chilli. Serves 4 1 large or two small red peppers 3 tbsp olive oil 500ml tomato sauce A pinch of chilli (optional) 4 large eggs Toast (rubbed with garlic, if you like) 1 Peel, core and seed the pepper and cut into thin strips. In a large, deep frying pan, warm the olive oil over a medium-low flame, add the pepper and fry gently until soft, which will take about 7 minutes. Add the sauce and chilli, stir, lower the flame and simmer – stirring from time to time – for 10 minutes. Taste, adjust salt if necessary. 2 Using a wooden spoon, make a crater in the sauce and quickly crack an egg into it. Repeat for the other three eggs. Cover the pan for 3 minutes, or until the eggs have set, but the yolks are still a bit runny. Serve right away with toast. The classic pasta dish: spaghetti with tomato sauce A couple of things: look out for decent-quality pasta (such as Garofalo), ideally extruded over bronze, which sounds grand, but isn’t. It is a process used by all good manufacturers to give pasta the rough texture that helps the sauce cling. Cook the pasta until al dente. Whether you eat it just so, or finished with a dusting of cheese, spaghetti al pomodoro is one of the world’s truly great meals.You could, of course, add a couple of anchovies, or a handful of capers and black olives to the sauce as you heat it up. Though it may seem basic, spaghetti with tomato sauce, when done well, is one of life’s great flavour experiences. Photograph: Nassima Rothacker/Guardian Serves 4 500g spaghetti 500ml tomato sauce A sprig of fresh basil Parmesan or pecorino Salt 1 Bring a large pan of water to a fast boil, add salt, stir and add spaghetti. 2 While the spaghetti cooks, warm the sauce in a small pan with a sprig of basil, tasting and adjusting salt if necessary. 3 Drain the spaghetti, tip into a bowl, pour in ¾ of the sauce and toss well. Divide the spaghetti between four bowls and top with the remaining sauce. Pass around a bowl of grated parmesan or pecorino for those who wish. The perfect pizzas: pizza with tomato sauce and various toppings There are no two ways about it: pizza-making is a floury, chaotic affair, especially if everyone is involved in making their own, which they will be. You will be rolling, baking and eating in batches, so I suggest a floured zone for rolling, a topping zone and the table ready with boards, knives, napkins and beers. It is important the oven is at 250C/500F/gas mark 10, and the baking tray preheated. I generally begin with pizza bianca (dough simply brushed with oil and sprinkled with salt) to get a handle on timings. Then it is up to you. My personal favourite is tomato sauce, anchovies and capers. Once you get serious about pizza sessions, you may want to invest in an olive oil can with a really thin spout to finish each pizza before it goes in the oven. A good tomato sauce is a must, but from then on, your imagination is the only limit. Photograph: Nassima Rothacker/Guardian Makes 12 small pizzas For the dough 500g plain flour, ideally Italian 00 2 tsp fine salt 10g fast-action dried yeast 30ml extra virgin olive oil 300ml warm water For the toppings 250–350ml tomato sauce Thin slices of mozzarella, capers, olives, anchovies, oregano, thinly sliced red onion, prosciutto etc 1 In a large bowl, mix the flour, salt and yeast. Add the olive oil, then the water and, using first a spoon and then your hands, bring the dough into a rough ball. 2 Take the dough from the bowl and then slap it down hard several times on a floured work surface to stretch it out. Then knead the dough using the heel of your hand to first push the dough away from you – so stretching it out – and then fold it back over. As you fold the dough back in, rotate it a little each time. Continue kneading like this for about 8 minutes, by which point the dough should feel soft and springy. Put it back in a clean bowl, cover with oiled clingfilm or a tea towel and leave in a warm place for an hour or until it has doubled in size. 3 Preheat the oven to 250C/500F/gas mark 10 and put a baking tray or pizza stone in it. Divide the dough into 12 balls – at this point the dough can be put on a tray, covered with a cloth and kept in the fridge for up to 12 hours. Cook the pizzas in pairs. Roll two balls into roughly 20cm discs. Remove the tray from the oven, then working quickly, put the pizzas on the tray, spread with some sauce and toppings (finish with a drizzle of oil, if you like) and slide into the oven for 5–7 minutes, depending on your oven. The speedy stew: white beans in tomato sauce In an ideal world – or rather fridge – I would have a get-ahead pan of both white beans and tomato sauce on the go at all times. With a couple of ladlefuls of both, warmed in a pan while the bread is toasted, a tasty supper would be on the table quicker than you can say “beans on toast”. I have only managed this ideal fridge once; the rest of the time I use tinned cannellini or butter beans with a portion of sauce. Sausages or couscous make it slightly more work, but not much. Sausages make a substantial meal of this quick-to-whip-up white beans in tomato sauce stew. Photograph: Nassima Rothacker/Guardian Serves 4 500ml tomato sauce 400g cooked white beans Salt and black pepper To serve Sausages, couscous or toast 1 In a pan, over a medium-low heat, warm the beans and sauce. Taste-adjust the salt and grind over some black pepper. Serve with grilled sausages, couscous or simply on toast. • Rachel Roddy writes the popular blog racheleats.wordpress.com.

The film was partly inspired by my grandparents, former Hollywood actor Ginny (still very much alive) and [New York gallerist] John – specifically by the parties they threw at their apartment in Rome. There, in the primo piano of Palazzo Caetani, the beautiful elite, the literati, the glitterati, musicians and artists and actors and singers made and lived and breathed la dolce vita to the backdrop of a Rome very different from today’s. Fellini asked Ginny to appear as Steiner’s wife, but she declined – instead Steiner’s home is a facsimile of her old apartment. My gran’s figurine lamps light the scene of Steiner’s party, her friends fill it (including Iris Tree), and Ginny’s naive paintings decorate the walls in the film. The doll-like portrait behind Marcello’s head, one of hers, is of my young mum, Haidee, and Steiner’s children stand in the doorway of the party room as my mama used to. In contrast to Ginny’s sometimes surreal compositions my mum’s work is visceral and alive. Her paintings adorn my restaurant Bocca di Lupo and define my new venture, Vico, outside and in. She filled me with her love from the day I was born, and she filled me with food while she was at it. I grew up in love with her, in love with Italy, and in love with la dolce vita – the time and place that bore her. I feel at home when I land on Italian soil, though I have never lived there and have no Italian blood in my veins. I admire – covet – Latin social ease, when I myself am too shy to say hello to people even in my own restaurant. And so I take every opportunity to visit, so that I can at least pretend to live “the sweet life”, the land where no one is a stranger. On one visit, Mum and I stop for a day in Rome en route to Sperlonga, the seaside town where John bought a flat to escape Ginny’s parties, and which we still keep. We visit her old home, by Largo Argentina, ever overrun by feral cats, and find the doorman’s wife, half-deaf and half-blind, ensconced in the gatehouse, mending clothes. She shrieks with delight when she recognises Mama. A few minutes on and we are in the shadow of the Pantheon’s dome, at Caffè Sant Eustachio, a little roastery where the coffee is poison nectar and the baristas so intoxicated with caffeine their skin has an eerie green hue. It’s only a couple of paces more to Tre Scalini on Piazza Navona, which Domitian built to flood for his boat games. There we scoff infamous tartufo (Italian rocky road gelato slabs) perched on Bernini’s fountain. Onwards to Campo de’ Fiori, we purchase slabs of pizza al taglio and head towards the ghetto, passing by Filetti di Baccalà where rotund matrons should be frying thin strips of salt cod and we’re saved! It’s closed. From the ruined arches of the Coliseum we cross the river to Trastevere, and decide we are too full to eat dinner at da Enzo. We pass by to release our reservation, which in any event they have lost. It smells so good we recant, and hang around for a table. Later, we walk along the Tiber for a grattachecca – shaved ice, a frozen relic of Emperor Nero’s penchant for snow carried down from the mountains and sweetened with fruit syrups, ours spiked with vodka, to ease us into the evening. Never for a moment have we stopped walking, eating or talking. This way of eating – proper, rarefied and delicious snacks consumed on the hoof – is typical of Italy. The young gather amicably in the piazza, and everyone takes an evening passeggiata, mingling and talking and showing off. Eating gelati, crespelle (crepes), bombe (donuts), arancini, pizze, panini, polpette. This is street food here – not because it is cooked in the street necessarily, by a pedlar or from a van, but because it is eaten there. And there, in the acts of eating and talking and meeting and walking, is the heart of that Mediterranean social fluidity we are so envious of in England. Vico, my new restaurant, is my attempt to recreate a slice of that lifestyle I wish were my own. It is not somewhere to go to, but somewhere to pass through, to meet friends, to grab a bite and a glass and move on. Here are a few recipes to enjoy in passing, between one meal and the next… Shaved raw asparagus with balsamic vinegar and parmesan Photograph: Jean Cazals for Observer Food Monthly This salad is a celebration of Emilia-Romagna. Choose the fattest stalks. Served 4 as a starter or a side asparagus 12 fat spears (about half a kilo) rocket 100g (1 bunch) extra virgin olive oil 25ml good balsamic vinegar 2 tsp parmesan 75g, shaved with a potato peeler Break the tough stems from the asparagus and discard. Shave as much of the spears as you can, lengthways with a potato peeler from stalk to tip. Slice the last bit of stem as thinly as you can with a knife. When ready to serve, toss the asparagus and rocket with the oil and vinegar, and add salt and pepper to taste. Serve scattered with parmesan. Pickled sardines with pink onions Photograph: Jean Cazals for Observer Food Monthly The onions turn a delightful pink in the pickling, which makes for an attractive plate against the silvery skins of lightly cured sardine fillets. Pickling oily fish is an easy project, and a great way to introduce the sceptical – the acidic soak helps temper the more pungent flavours that some find off-putting, and results in a delicate flavour here balanced with the aroma of fresh oregano and a slight hint of chilli heat. It’s best to start this the day before you plan to eat. Serves 8 as a starter scaled fillets of sardines 750g, or 16 whole sardines, about 1.5kg, scaled, gutted and butterfly-filleted fine sea salt 10g black pepper ½ tsp red onion 1 small (200g), sliced very very thinly across the grain in half-moons fresh oregano leaves 1 tbsp crushed dried chilli flakes ½ tsp red wine vinegar 200ml water 200ml extra virgin olive oil 100ml Check the sardines are completely scaled and nicely filleted. Sprinkle them with salt and pepper; leave to infuse for a little while in the fridge – about an hour, give or take. Transfer them to a plastic container, layering them with onion, oregano and chilli. Mix together the vinegar and water and pour it over the sardines. Agitate a little with your fingers to make sure the pickle gets between the fillets. Leave in the fridge for 4 hours (for a light pickle – longer if you like). Drain the sardines and arrange them flat on a serving dish, silver skins up. Scatter the pickled onions over the fish and drizzle with the oil. Though you can eat them straight away (best with toast), the drained, oiled sardines improve if refrigerated overnight. Allow them to come to room temperature before serving. Lasagnancini Photograph: Jean Cazals for Observer Food Monthly These are the antithesis of healthy eating, and trashy as hell – what more could you want? Makes about 10 dried egg pappardelle 300g, or leftover cooked egg pasta 600g bolognese ragu 700g of your favourite recipe, or see below parmesan 120g, grated béchamel sauce 150g, thick, chilled until solid (optional) flour about 50g, for dusting eggs 2, beaten panko breadcrumbs about 100g, milled fine, or 150g normal ones, for coating vegetable oil for deep frying Break the nests of dried pasta roughly in your hands, set a pan of salted water on to boil and cook the pasta very al dente – a little undercooked even, to your taste – and drain it. Mix it with the ragu. Spread it out on a tray, sprinkle with the cheese and leave to cool, then refrigerate. Mix the pasta up with your hands, divide it into 10 portions. Form each into as tight a ball as you can manage, using your hands. If using the béchamel, put a tablespoon in the centre of each one. Dust the balls in the flour, then coat in the egg, then in the breadcrumbs. Refrigerate until ready to eat. Deep-fry in oil at 160C for 10 minutes. Ragù bolognese Serves 8 minced pork 500g minced veal (or beef) 500g chicken livers 100g, finely chopped (optional) carrot 1 (200g) celery 2 sticks (200g) onion 1, medium (200g) garlic cloves 4 butter 100g extra virgin olive oil 60ml pancetta 100g, not smoked, cut in strips white wine 375ml milk 600ml chopped tinned tomatoes 400g beef or chicken stock 250ml (optional, otherwise 250ml more milk) It is worth having a butcher mince the meats coarsely (8mm), for the improved texture. Peel and dice the carrot, dice the celery, chop the onion and slice the garlic. Take a very wide frying pan (30cm), and melt the butter in the oil over a medium heat. Add the vegetables and pancetta along with a good pinch of salt and sauté for 10-15 minutes until softened. Increase the heat to high and add the meat in four or five additions, allowing time for any water to evaporate, stirring and breaking up any lumps with a spoon. After the last addition, wait until the pan starts to splutter slightly, then decrease the heat to medium and fry, stirring occasionally, until the meat has browned with a fair proportion of crispy bits – about 15-20 minutes. Deglaze with the wine, then transfer to a saucepan along with the milk, tomatoes and stock as well as a good grinding of pepper and more salt to taste. Cook at a very gentle simmer, uncovered, for about 4 hours until the sauce is thick, more oil- than water-based (add a little stock or water if it dries too much or too quickly). When ready, the liquor will be as thick as double cream and, stirred up, the whole should be somewhat porridgy. Adjust the seasoning one last time. The addition of bay and/or dried chilli flakes along with the meat is heretical, but not displeasing. Polpette ‘cacio e uva’ Photograph: Jean Cazals for Observer Food Monthly In Abruzzo, around Easter, they make a dish that is all-things-Eastery in one – slow-cooked lamb, its sauce thickened with eggs and lemon and pecorino. It is rich, refreshing, meaty, cheesy, eggy, lemony, comforting, exciting. Makes a dozen meatballs leftover cooked lamb 400g, preferably braised, pot-roasted or slow-roast shoulder or leg meat, diced 1cm or slightly smaller pan juices from the lamb 2 tbsp breadcrumbs 10g (about 2 tbsp) lemon 1, zest and juice fresh rosemary leaves 1 dsp, finely chopped egg yolks 4 pecorino romano 150g, grated flour about 50g, for dusting eggs 2, beaten panko breadcrumbs about 100g, or 150g normal ones, milled fine, for coating vegetable oil for deep frying Pound together (or whizz in a food processor) about a quarter of the lamb with the lamb pan juice, breadcrumbs, lemon zest and juice, rosemary and egg yolk. Mix together with the remaining diced lamb and the pecorino, and season with salt and pepper. The texture should be gloopy, but thick enough to form into balls. Make about a dozen, each the size of a golf ball. As you go, roll them in the flour, then the egg and finally the breadcrumb. Refrigerate until ready to cook, then deep fry for 8 minutes in 160C oil. Octopus and potato salad Photograph: Jean Cazals for Observer Food Monthly It was at Moro I first learned to dress potato salads with vinegar, while the potatoes are warm. They absorb the dressing, and develop a depth of flavour that is lifted by the acidity. Serves 4 as a light meal raw octopus 1 medium (1-1.5kg), best are from frozen, Mediterranean double-sucker (defrosted) new potatoes 1kg largeish, skin on red wine vinegar 60ml extra virgin olive oil 50ml celery 3 stalks, sliced across in 5mm crescent moons capers 50g, soaked in water, if salted red onion ½ a very small, thinly sliced across the grain flat-leaf parsley a few sprigs, roughly chopped Boil the octopus for 40 minutes in lightly salted water. Drain it, and leave it to cool on a tray. Reserve the water, leaving it on the heat. Boil the potatoes in the octopussy water until tender. Drain them, and cut them, still warm, in 2-3cm chunks. Dress the potatoes with the vinegar and oil. Cut the octopus into 2cm chunks (discard the beak and eyes if they’re still there). Toss it with the potatoes, leave to cool to room temperature. Add the remaining ingredients, toss and season to taste. Anchovy and mozzarella crostini Photograph: Jean Cazals for Observer Food Monthly Most pizzeria bake or at least serve bread too, and what’s left at the end of the day goes stale. For reasons of economy, and to earn an extra euro, they make bruschetta (toasted bread with toppings) and crostini (open toasties) in the pizza oven. The former is best with raw tomato on top, but my favourite crostino is laden with gooey mozzarella and salty, savoury anchovy. Makes 8, enough for 4 as a starter or snack ciabatta bread 8 slices, fresh or stale, 1½cm thick (or baguette sliced on the bias) extra virgin olive oil 50ml (about 3 tbsp) buffalo mozzarella 350-400g plump salted anchovy fillets 8 (buy the very best you can find) freshly ground black pepper lots Preheat the oven to maximum, with the fan on if it has one. Lay the bread on a baking tray and drizzle with half the oil. Tear or slice the mozzarella and arrange it over the slices of bread, to more or less cover each slice. Lay an anchovy fillet on each. Drizzle with the remaining oil, and scatter liberally with pepper. Bake for 12-15 minutes until the cheese is browning and bubbling, and the bread toasty underneath. Serve hot. Strawberry granita and cream Photograph: Jean Cazals for Observer Food Monthly This is a very simple cheat’s way to make a granita – blending frozen fruit, instead of all that faff of forking, freezing and fluffing. While granita is typically Italian, particularly the coffee or orange or mulberry flavours so typical of Sicily, strawberries and cream is so very English. Just as all Sicilian cuisine is a fusion – of Roman and Arabic and Jewish and French – so this is a fusion of England and Sicily. Civilised, but refreshing. Serves 4 frozen strawberries 500g cold water 250ml caster sugar 60g whipping cream 150ml, whipped with caster sugar 15g (1 tbsp) Put the strawberries, water and sugar in an upright blender. Blend until smooth and slushy. The mixture is very thick and, at least until most of the strawberries have broken down, very hard for the blade to turn. You may need to shake the blender, or turn it off every few seconds to stir before giving another pulse. Serve topped with the whipped cream.

One pizza, one panel of judges, plenty of brow-furrowing questions on how you made the thing. “I just kept thinking to myself, ‘Make it like you’re in the restaurant and it’s for a customer’,” explains Johnny Di Francesco, the Melbourne pizzaiolo who took out the top prize in the Pizza World Championship in Parma, Italy, last week. “I was the only one to make my dough by hand, everyone else used machines. I think that helped.” Di Francesco has invited me to taste his winning dish, a seemingly humble margherita, at his restaurant, 400 Gradi in Brunswick. Patrons slap him on the back in congratulation as staff furiously roll out dough in preparation for the wood fired oven at the heart of the establishment. What follows is the most technical conversation imaginable about one of the country’s most popular takeaway dishes. The world championship rules state the pizza must be 35cm or less in diameter, with a crust that puffs up by 2cm. Only certain ingredients, such as cheese, peeled tomatoes, basil and olive oil, can be used. Di Francesco, who goes by the nickname Mr Pizza, explains that the doughy base must never be lifted off the counter by hand, as it attracts flour to the bottom. Flour burns in the oven. Johnny Di Francesco's branded flour, crucial to his prize-winning pizza dough. Photograph: Laura Owsianka/The Guardian Photograph: Laura Owsianka /The Guardian Flour is a consuming passion for Di Francesco. He sources it from a long-established mill near Padua. His custom is appreciated, and the flour company has put Di Francesco’s drawn face on its packaging, which stares at us as we eat. The tomatoes are imported from Italy too, although the basil is grown locally. Great care is also taken over the buffalo mozzarella and olive oil. “I used to run a takeaway business, but I felt I was wasting away there,” Di Francesco said. “I wanted to create something special.” He picks up a paper receipt and holds it rigid. “People think a pizza should be like this. A slice that’s completely flat. My answer to that is, are we eating a pizza here, or a biscuit?” So what does the best pizza in the world taste like? In a word, splendid. It is a worthy winner in a competition that attracted 600 entrants from 35 countries. The tomatoes are sweet and zesty, although Di Francesco just adds a dash of salt, not sugar. The crust is perfectly cooked, while the basil and cheese combine beautifully. Unlike many pizzas, it’s not overly filling. “People think a margherita is easy, but it’s a hard pizza to make,” says Di Francesco. “There’s nowhere to hide with the flavours. Some margheritas are just drowning with cheese. That’s what I’ve tried to avoid.” Move aside, Naples and Rome. Mr Pizza from Brunswick has trumped you both.","Id":"lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2014/apr/16/melbourne-pizza-johnny-di-francesco","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webTitle":"Tasting the perfect pizza ... in Melbourne","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2014/apr/16/melbourne-pizza-johnny-di-francesco","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2014/apr/16/melbourne-pizza-johnny-di-francesco","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":472,"webPublicationDate":"2014-04-16T01:39:42Z","id":"lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2014/apr/16/melbourne-pizza-johnny-di-francesco","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"The best food they ate in 2015","body":"Çiya Sofrasi and Kadiköy market, Istanbul René Redzepi Chef-patron, Noma, Copenhagen Walking through Kadiköy market in Istanbul you see dried aubergines hanging from stalls, dried chilli peppers and fresh dürüm, and Turkish tea being poured all throughout. You hear street merchants calling out their catch of the day, maybe a bag of sardines, turbot from the Black Sea or a kilo of mussels. I was there en route to Çiya, in the heart of this picturesque market. Çiya to me embodies the perfect restaurant: full of tradition but not afraid of innovating, with a generous and welcoming space. The meal is a cornucopia of all there is to offer from Anatolia – lamb stewed with dried cherries, chopped parsley with vinegar, rice cooked with raisins and fistfuls of whole spices... I would happily put myself on a plane just to go and have lunch there on a beautiful spring day. Pickled herring platter at Russ & Daughters, New York Yotam Ottolenghi Chef and food writer It was a platter of pickled herring fillets with three sauce options on the side – cream, mustard and curry – along with schmaltz herring fillets and then matjes herring fillets. In the centre were pickled onions, roll mops and a beet and herring salad. I had it for breakfast, around 11am, and it left a sweet (albeit fishy) taste in my mouth for the next few days. I love the cafe, which opened last year and is strongly modelled on the long-established store. Sardines, chubs, rugelach, pickles, boxes of matzo, halva sold by the block, rye bread to blow your socks off, Bloody Marys: these are the flavours which define New York for me. Idiazábal cheese, Urbia mountains, Spain Elena Arzak Chef-patron, Arzak, San Sebastián This spring I made an idiazábal cheese with a shepherd in the Urbia mountains in the Basque country. We used natural rennet which the shepherd made from the stomach of a latxa lamb. When I went to pick my cheese up this autumn (after the ageing process) it had all the rich true flavour of the milk, but you could also sense the environment in which the mother had grazed. I could close my eyes and imagine myself on that windswept mountain top. The fact I made it heightened the flavour. I ate it with my family, either by itself or with walnuts, quince jelly and apple jelly. Dashi-simmered asparagus, tofu and egg at Koya, London Sarit Packer and Itamar Srulovich Chef-owners, Honey & Co, London We went to Koya a couple of days before it closed and had an amazing goodbye meal. The asparagus and tofu dish was so delicious, we ordered another for dessert. It had those really fat English asparagus, blanched and chargrilled, with tofu, bonito flakes and a dashi broth. It was so nicely balanced and full of flavour. The next day, Itamar went back with our head chef to eat it all over again. The food in those last days of Koya felt very organic, more like dishes Junya [Yamasaki, the head chef] would make at home than normal restaurant stuff. Sea urchins from County Cork Jacob Kenedy Chef-patron, Bocca di Lupo, London From now until February or March, you can get amazing sea urchins from Ireland. I had my first one last week and it was mindbogglingly good. You can get warm-water sea urchins, which tend to be bigger and more impressive-looking, all year round, but they are much less intensely flavoured. The Irish ones – mine came from John Chamberlain in Dunmanus Bay, Co Cork – have an enveloping fishy flavour. They’re wonderful stirred through pasta or with sushi, but I prefer them on their own with just a tiny squeeze of lemon. You slice them open, clean out the gunky stuff, rinse them in sea water and scoop out the eggs with a teaspoon. It makes you realise how amazing nature is, and how little we should mess with our food. Sea-salt ice cream in Dingle, County Kerry James ‘Jocky’ Petrie Group executive development chef, Gordon Ramsay Group In Dingle this summer, during a chowder competition with lots of Guinness and live music, I tried a sea-salt ice cream at Murphy’s. It was one of those things that makes you go, damn, why didn’t I think of that? Everyone loves salted caramel, but this is different: just plain ice cream with sea salt. It sounds odd but it really works: the sweetness of the sugar balances the salty character. It’s almost savoury but not quite – it’s just a sweet salt. People come from miles around to eat this ice cream. Lamb köfte at Sultanahmet Köftecisi, Istanbul Karam Sethi Chef-patron, Gymkhana, Trishna, London I went to Istanbul for the first time this year and ate at a place called Sultanahmet Köftecisi. After visiting the Blue Mosque nearby, we saw the big queue outside and decided to find out what was going on. They specialise in lamb köftes grilled very simply over charcoal and served with bread, pickled chillies and their house chilli paste. We ordered one and ended up having six. It’s tough to find something so succulent and juicy and flavourful. I think it’s down to the quality and fat content of the meat, and that they serve them hot off the grill, so you can still taste the charcoal. They’ve mastered the recipe over years and years. It’s the ultimate kebab. Yuzu ramen at Afuri, Tokyo. Illustration: Nick Shepherd Yuzu ramen at Afuri, Tokyo Brett Redman Chef-owner, The Richmond, Elliot’s, Jidori, London On a research visit to Tokyo at the start of the year, I had a yuzu shio-ramen at a place called Afuri in the basement of a shopping centre in Roppongi Hills. I’m not an aficionado but it was the best ramen I’ve ever had. They make it with chicken stock, which makes it much lighter than the rich, milky tonkotsu ramen we’re used to in London. The addition of fresh yuzu is ingenious: the intensity and fragrance of yuzu peel blasts all the way through the stock. It left my head spinning: how do you get so much flavour into this bowl? Khao chae at Lai Rod, Bangkok Fuchsia Dunlop Food writer I was going to recommend a meal at the Dragon Well Manor restaurant in Hangzhou – every time I go there it’s the best meal of the year – but then I had something totally amazing today in Bangkok. I was in Thailand for the first time and the food blogger The Skinny Bib recommended I go to an old-school Thai restaurant called Lai Rod. The standout from quite a long lunch was a dish called khao chae: grains of rice in iced water with flower petals, perfumed with candle smoke. It was served with a platter of deep-fried relishes – green chilli stuffed with pork, fish floss flavoured with coconut, caramelised beef and some salted radish with a little egg yolk – and beautifully cut pieces of green mango, cucumber and a crunchy yellow root with a remarkable taste. The combination of the sweet, salty and umami flavours from the relishes and the smoky, perfumed rice soup was a revelation. Grilled shrimps at Sa Foradada, Mallorca Tomos Parry Head chef, Kitty Fisher’s, London I went to this fantastic cliffside restaurant this summer. The whole experience is pretty special: you park your car, jump over a fence (which stays closed to keep wild donkeys in) and walk for half an hour through fields with fig trees and goats. The trek is worth it for the food and the view – you’re looking out over the bay where they catch most of your dinner. I particularly liked the shrimp, cooked very simply over a grill with wood from the trees around the restaurant. A lot of the skill in grilling lies in restraint, and these shrimp were barely cooked, so you can still taste the sea without being overpowered by the wood. Grilled shrimps at Sa Foradada, Mallorca. Illustration: Nick Shepherd Unpasteurised cream from Ottinge Court Farm, Kent Stephen Harris Chef-patron, The Sportsman, Seasalter, Kent I’m slightly obsessed with dairy produce and this year I’ve started buying unpasteurised cream from Ottinge Court Farm near Folkestone. We hadn’t been able to get it at the restaurant for about five years because the testing required for unpasteurised milk has become prohibitively expensive for most farms. The difference is just incredible. The pasteurisation process wipes out all the interesting things. In this, I can taste a hint of flowers and a rosewater tone. There’s a slight dung-y taste, which some people find offputting but I really like. You know it has come from a cow as opposed to a goat or a sheep, because it smells a bit like when you get near cows. I’ve been trying it out with a warm chocolate mousse and a tiny bit of salt and that’s probably the best thing I’ve tasted all year. Iio Jozo’s fujisu vinegar, Japan James Lowe Head chef, Lyle’s, London In February I visited Iio Jozo, a vinegar-maker outside Kyoto which has been producing rice vinegar for 120 years. They oversee all the parts of the process themselves: they brew their own sake and have local farmers growing the organic rice for them. One thing they do is collect the sake lees – the fermented rice left over after filtering – and pile it into big wooden barrels to age for up to 10 years. It starts out as a white, pure-looking paste but by year ten it’s black like treacle. The vinegar he makes from it is incredible. He gave me a litre bottle and, at first, I tried to use it sparingly, but I ended up putting it on lots of things at the restaurant. It was gone within a week. Pasta al forno at La Cantinetta, Barolo, Italy Sam Harris Chef-patron, Zucca, London I’ve been eating at La Cantinetta since I started going to Piedmont 15 years ago – it’s a very simple little trattoria run by two brothers – but it was the first time I’d had this dish. They ran it as a special and it was amazing – a perfect baked pasta. Pasta al forno is basically lasagne, though the woman serving us insisted there was a difference. This one was quite firm and didn’t collapse all over the plate, which is a good thing. There were loads of layers – we counted about 15 – and a very scant amount of béchamel and meat ragu, but just the right amount. The seasoning was bang on, it was really crisp on the top. I’ve had millions of lasagnes over the years, but this blew my head off. Ochazuke at Ishikawa, Tokyo Isaac McHale Head chef, the Clove Club, London Ochazuke is a dish of rice, a few bits to sprinkle on top – seaweed, toasted things, salmon eggs, shiso, whatever you have – with green tea or dashi poured over it, a Japanese late-night fridge buffet. The fresh rice, the cornerstone of a Japanese meal, was a revelation. It was fragrant, just chewy, almost al dente and made me really pay attention to the rice for the rest of our trip. I’ve been reading about ochazuke in Japanese Cooking: A Simple Art for 18 years and dreaming of a Scottish version, with Assam tea and pheasant broth over barley. To be served one in one of the best restaurants in Japan, made my heart sing. Porcini in Tuscany Ruth Rogers Chef and co-founder, the River Café, London The family, around 20 of us, go to Tuscany every summer, near Monte Amiata. This year we were there when the first porcini were found. Our gardener brought them for us as a surprise, then I roasted them whole with a bit of garlic and thyme, two hours after they were picked. We put them in the oven for a long time, almost an hour, then ate them with nothing else on the plate. It was the setting as much as the flavour; all of us being there together, the excitement of them arriving. It was late August, so it felt like a farewell to summer and the beginning of autumn. Lobster pasta at Hedone, London Nathan Outlaw Chef-patron, Restaurant Nathan Outlaw, Port Isaac, Cornwall A lot of people told me Hedone was good, but the lobster pasta was the best thing I’ve ever eaten in England, and I’ve eaten a lot of food in England. It wasn’t so much the cooking as the ingredients. They kill all their seafood fresh to order and that makes all the difference. You don’t get a menu. If you ask Mikael [Jonsson] for one, he says he’ll send it, but never does. But from what I can gather he took the coral from the lobster and put it into the bisque, which was slightly aerated. The pasta was just a flat sheet, almost like lasagna, and cooked perfectly. It’s refreshing to see a chef sticking to his guns and cooking the best produce he can find. The British restaurant scene is much newer than in France or Spain or Italy, and I don’t think we’ve scratched the surface of what’s possible in our own country, with our own ingredients. Sushi at Masa, New York Hélène Darroze Chef cuisinière, Hélène Darroze at the Connaught, London I was in New York with my chefs to cook a special dinner and we went to Masa. It’s not the kind of place you can go every day – it’s really expensive – but it was an experience. You eat at the counter, and they make everything à la minute, right in front of you. The best thing was a piece where the chef took a kind of white membrane of the tuna – not the the meat itself – and wove it over a piece of rice into a piece of sushi. The rice was a little warm. It was so surprising: very smooth to eat but then the flavour of the tuna was like an explosion in the mouth. Just incredible. Sushi at Masa, New York. Illustration: Nick Shepherd Pizza at Mission Chinese, New York Lee Tiernan Chef-owner, Black Axe Mangal, London I was scared about opening our new restaurant, and Danny Bowien invited me over to spend a few days at Mission Chinese in New York. I always feel calm around Danny. He has a lot on his plate but he just deals with it. The best thing I ate was a cheese and tomato pizza with mapo tofu on top, cooked in their wood oven. The base is made to a Tartine bread recipe, then the tofu is just rolled around on top. It’s quite unusual to have a cheese and tomato DOP pizza on a Chinese restaurant menu, but nothing’s going to stop those guys doing what they want. I think about that pizza every day. I wish I was eating it right now, in fact. Roast lamb in Segovia, Spain Nieves Barragán Executive chef, Barrafina, London When I went to Segovia, one hour north of Madrid, I went to José María, a family place where they make the best roast mixed lamb on the wood fire. There were six of us; it was a four-hour lunch. We had two things: the lamb, which came with roast kidneys, and the suckling pig, with amazing roast potatoes and grilled peppers on the side. It was stunning: juicy, crisp … It sounds quite English, but the centre of Spain is like this, it’s very traditional – all roasts. Their oven is huge, so beautiful – half the size of Barrafina. I would love to have something like that in London. Tarte tatin in Lamotte-Beuvron, France Shuko Oda Head chef, Koya Bar, London We visited Lamotte-Beuvron, an hour or two from Paris, where tarte tatin is originally from. We went to the local bakery and bought the tarte tatin there. I don’t normally have a sweet tooth but it was absolutely beautiful. It was a nothing-special-but-everything-about-it-was-special type of thing. Goat’s curd mousse at Lyle’s, London Anissa Helou Food writer Lyle’s has been my favourite restaurant more or less since it opened, and a few months ago I took two young Qatari friends for dinner as I wanted them to taste James Lowe’s cooking. It was a perfect meal, ending with an amazing goat’s curd mousse. It was sensational: a little bowl with the mousse on the bottom, covered by an apple granita made with estivale apples and sorrel. The apples weren’t peeled so the flavour was incredibly intense – but not too sweet. And then there was this beautiful crunchy cracker – a very, very thin sheet – made with apple, sugar and star anise. The textures were incredible: creamy, icy and then crackly. My friends loved it. Pizza at Gjusta, Los Angeles Claire Ptak Owner, Violet Bakery, London The thing that’s really been on my mind is this pizza we had in Los Angeles at Gjusta [a bakery and café]. It was one of the best, most perfectly seasoned, chewy, crunchy, doughy things I’ve ever eaten. I’ve been dreaming about it. It’s more like pizza bianca that you get in Rome, but thinner. They make it in big rectangular sheet pans. Really salty and oily, and stretched out. The one we ate had tomatoes, red onion, little bits of ricotta, an egg, and just oil and salt. It was transcendent. Pizza at Gjusta, Los Angeles. Illustration: Nick Shepherd Grouse from Scotland Blanche Vaughan Cook and food writer I was standing on a moor in mid-September just when the heather is in flower and I shot a grouse. I plucked it myself, wrapped it up and took it back on the train. It’s a nice thing to be able to cook for other people. I made a recipe I learned at the River Café: you make a bruschetta with roast tomatoes on top, slosh in red wine so it soaks into the bread, then you brown the bird and roast it on top of the bruschetta so all the juices seep in. Burger at the Four Seasons, New York Fergus Henderson Co-owner, St John, London A perfect burger at the Four Seasons bar in the Seagram Building in New York. I had a dry martini, which is a good way to start lunch, and a very nice pinot noir to wash it down. A real treat. It was a classic burger but it’s the setting: it’s a beautiful room, a special place. They have chainmail on the windows, which shimmers. The bar has amazing spikes hanging above it, so everything they serve could be the last thing you ever eat or drink before a spike runs you through, which adds a certain twist to the whole thing. Grilled cauliflower at Hearth, New York Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley Cookery writers In September we went to Hearth in New York. They offered us a seat at the chef’s pass (directly in front of the kitchen), where we enjoyed the most incredible six-course tasting menu right at the heart of all the action. The atmosphere was electric, the food was incredible – the grilled cauliflower with sunflower seeds and capers, and grilled beef neck were especially memorable – and typical of chef Marco Canora’s food philosophy. His rustic, home-style cooking champions seasonal produce, nose-to-tail eating and a “waste not, want not” attitude. Spaghettoni at Ristorante Lido 84, Lake Garda, Italy Andrea Petrini Food writer, founder of Gelinaz! Spaghettoni at Ristorante Lido 84, Lake Garda, Italy. Illustration: Nick Shepherd It’s simple – almost provocatively simple. Spaghettoni [thick spaghetti], butter and beer yeast. When it comes to the table it’s almost monochrome – between pure white and lightly brown-ish in colour. The title of the dish may be simple, but of course it’s not just one butter, but a blend of three, and the beer has been spread out and cooked in the oven on a very gentle temperature until it solidifies. You have totally al dente spaghetti, the very savoury, milky presence of the butter, the suggestion of the crunchiness of the yeast that adds a dose of acidity, and a gently insinuating touch of caramelisation. It’s immediately recognisable comfort food that also pushes the boundaries. It’s an instant classic, something I fear the chef, Riccardo Camanini, will have on his shoulders for many years to come. You cannot add anything else, because you would destroy the balance, the subtle dialogue between these three major ingredients. And if you take something out, it falls apart. For me, that’s the definition of a dish, or a piece of art. You eat it in three bites, but it stays with you for a really long time. Porra de naranja at Arte de Cozina, Málaga, Spain Samantha Clark Chef and co-owner, Moro, Morito, London We have a house near Granada and we decided to do a detour and fly into Málaga to try a restaurant, Arte de Cozina, that one of our chefs had told us about. The standout dishes were porra de naranja and kid’s sweetbreads. Porras are the precursors to gazpachos but made with fewer ingredients – sometimes just bread or dried fava beans, garlic, olive oil and water. This one was scented with orange. The texture was smooth and creamy, the flavour subtle with orange, a fruity olive oil and perhaps a touch of vinegar. Topped with chopped almonds for crunch and salty jamón to balance the sweetness, it was nectar. ‘Adidas’ nigiri at Sawada, Tokyo Enrique Olvera Chef-patron, Pujol, Mexico City Sawada is a tiny two-Michelin-star sushi bar with only six chairs, where the owner, Koji Sawada, and his wife are the only ones taking care of every aspect of the entire omakase. It was a tuna fish nigiri, but a totally different cut, between the chutoro (belly area) and the otoro, with so much fat it actually melted in your mouth. It was named by Sawada as the three lines of fat form an “Adidas” appearance, like the three lines of the sport brand. The thing that inspired me the most was to see Sawada doing such an unusual thing but with so much respect for his culture. Innovating from tradition, applying a subtle change or improvement. You can still do new things that honour your roots. Bonnat Madagascar chocolate bar David Williams The Observer wine writer As someone with expensive tastes in wine and whisky (professional hazard) and cheese (just plain greed), I’ve been wary of developing an addiction to posh ‘bean to bar’ chocolate. The chocolate penny finally dropped with a bar made by French artisans Bonnat from beans sourced in Madagascar. A light, fruity, elegant creamy style described as “the pinot noir” of chocolate, it had me using words I’d usually reserve for wine: balance, texture, and most of all, length (the taste lasted for minutes). Buttermilk chicken at the Clove Club, London Thomasina Miers Wahaca founder, cookery writer For my mother’s birthday at the end of January we took her to the Clove Club. They blew us away with the food. We had the buttermilk chicken, consommé and 100-year-old madeira, and an Orkney scallop and orange dish that was so light. It’s exceptional how much they make from scratch: the charcuterie, the butter, the bread … My mother was blown away. Her eyes were shining like a seven-year-old’s at Christmas. Jamón from Barcelona Angela Hartnett Chef-patron, Murano, Cafe Murano I bought a jamón from Joan La Llar del Pernil, brought it back to London and had a jamón party in my garden. I invited Nieves [Barragán] and José [Pizarro] over, and some of my chefs; I thought I’d get everyone round at 2pm and they’d be gone by 8pm, but, of course, everyone was there until two in the morning. We’ve since gone back to Barcelona and bought another jamón. Squat lobster from the Firth of Clyde Ben Reade Co-founder, Edinburgh Food Studio, Edinburgh The most delicious thing I ate this year was a surprise gift of squat lobsters from a fisherman on the Firth of the Clyde called Ian Wightman. I’d ordered a load of langoustines [for a festival I was cooking at in North Ayrshire] and he gave us these as a bonus. We cooked them up the top of a glen over an oak fire, with white wine, butter and some nutmeg. They are one of the sweetest, most delicious meats ever, but not many people use them – in fact, most fishermen throw them back because they’re so small and they have horrible shells that cut into your fingers when you’re opening them. But they’re really worth the hassle, and the less you do when you’re cooking them the better.","Id":"lifeandstyle/2015/dec/13/the-best-food-they-ate-in-2015","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webTitle":"The best food they ate in 2015","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/13/the-best-food-they-ate-in-2015","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/13/the-best-food-they-ate-in-2015","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":4015,"webPublicationDate":"2015-12-14T09:54:35Z","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/dec/13/the-best-food-they-ate-in-2015","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Gaining currency: fall of euro has American tourists flocking to Europe","body":"Last spring, when one US dollar got you a paltry €0.72, Americans visiting to Paris needed to fork out $17 for a €12 entrance ticket to the permanent collections of the Louvre. Today the same ticket will set them back barely $13. Likewise, a reasonable three-star hotel in Rome: perhaps $350 last year, more like $275 this. Or three courses for two – plus a few beers – in one of an Amsterdam eetcafe: about $100 just 18 months ago but $75 now. “Europe feels like it’s on sale this year for Americans,” said Barrie Seidenberg, CEO of Viator, a US-based company that allows tourists to pre-book entrance tickets to the big attractions and small-group “jump the queue” tours before leaving home. As the euro currency sinks ever closer to parity with the dollar, the fact that a European vacation is now about 25% cheaper than it was last year has not escaped the attention of US holidaymakers. Although for some of the old world’s more popular attractions, that could cause problems. Over the last bank holiday weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported, the Palace of Versailles – despite recently investing €15m to revamp its entrance hall – was forced to post a message on its website asking tourists not already armed with an advance ticket to postpone their visit, or at least to confine it to the gardens. Versailles, the resplendent centre of French royal power until the 1789 revolution, drew more than 7.5 million visitors to its palace and gardens in 2013. But even that was comfortably exceeded by the world’s busiest museum, the Louvre, which is expecting to welcome well over 9 million people this year. Seidenberg said searches and bookings on the company’s site for attractions like the Louvre and the Sistine Chapel in Rome were up by 60%, while advance sales for the Eiffel Tower had soared by 170% this year. “Paris is on fire,” she said. “But really any place in Europe that people feel is iconic, that they have to see, and especially any place they fear there might be queues ... Much as people want to see the Sistine Chapel, they don’t want to queue for five hours in the Roman sun first.” Savvier American visitors have already learned that advance booking is now essential. “We planned it all online months ago from the US,” said Cindy Sohn, who is from southern California and visiting Paris with friends. “We spent two weekends meeting up over a bottle of wine deciding what to do, then I spent a day on museum websites booking everything for scheduled time slots.” Add to the surging US influx the growing number of Asian (particularly Chinese) holidaymakers eager to tour Europe’s most famous attractions, and it is hard to see how the visitor experience at many of Europe’s more venerable – and overcrowded – landmarks is not going to suffer. The Palace of Versailles recently asked prospective visitors, who had not bought an advance ticket, to consider postponing their visit. Photograph: Charles Platiau/Reuters Some tourists plainly have a miserable enough time already. “The lines are total chaos with little help from the staff and I couldn’t really advance purchase in this case: the website is terrible,” a recent US visitor to the Eiffel Tower wrote on the travel site Tripadvisor. Another agreed: “Lines were crazy, people trying to get you to buy things everywhere, trapping you and begging.” Of the Louvre, one Las Vegas tourist recorded that despite going late in the day, “It’s chaotic and a madhouse inside. It’s very disorganised too, even if you have the map.” A visitor from Virginia said the museum was “total and utter chaos” and that to see its main draw, the Mona Lisa, visitors should expect to “fight your way through a frenzied crowd pushing and shoving just to get a glimpse of it.” According to Atout France, the French tourism development agency, a record 3.2 million US tourists visited the country in 2014, encouraged by the euro’s gradual weakening over the course of the year. The number is expected to increase further this year. Anne-Laure Tuncer, director of the agency’s New York bureau, said early indications were that reservations for some categories of flights to France from the US were up by as much as 7% this April compared with last year. “It’s an indication of the way things are going,” she said. Tuncer added that a recent Gallup poll showed 82% of Americans had a broadly favourable image of France and the strong dollar-euro exchange rate was “a real bonus”. The impact should be felt not just in increased tourist numbers, she said, but “in upgrades – people tend to book more excursions, for example, or a better class of hotel. They’re easier with their money.” Rome’s Sistine Chapel now stays open until nearly midnight for one day each week to help deal with its 6 million visitors a year. Photograph: Musei Vaticani/Ansa/Claudio Peri/EPA In Venice, Florida-based tour organisers Randall and Dorothy Smith said their business had done well this year because the trips it runs, booked a year in advance with prices locked down in euros, are paid for only 30 days before they begin. “This year has been a banner year,” Randall said. “There’s money to be made.” For tourist attractions, there is also money to be spent. The Louvre is currently in the throes of a major £40m renovation programme aimed at helping it handle up to 14 million visitors a year – more than three times the number it was getting at the turn of the century. According to the museum, up to 40,000 people a day now jostle to see the Mona Lisa alone – funnelled towards it by a visitor flow system redesigned last year specifically to reflect the fact that, for many visitors to the Louvre, the enigmatic smile is all they really want to see. In Amsterdam, the celebrated Rijksmuseum reopened last year after a monumental £275m revamp that should allow it to cope with up to 5 million visitors a year. Along with several other major museums, it is also considering extending its hours (the Louvre, currently closed on Tuesdays, is thinking about staying open seven days a week). In Rome, the Sistine Chapel, expected to pull in 6 million visitors this year, is now staying open until nearly midnight one day a week. Even attractions outside city centres are also noticing a rise in US visitors. The Fondation Claude Monet, which runs the impressionist’s house and garden in Giverny, west of Paris, saw 625,000 visitors in the seven months it was open last year, 20% of them from America. “This year, the number of US visitors has already risen – and it’s around 27% of our total so far,” a spokesman said. Italy Just outside of Giolitti, one of the oldest gelaterias in Rome and a top tourist attraction, students Navi Atwal and Julia Spencer, both from California, admitted it was the favourable exchange rate that encouraged them to travel in Italy after their study abroad programme in Spain ended for the year. Spencer said she fully realised just how much the weakened euro helped her finances while she was studying in Spain: her monthly rent in euros stayed the same, but the dollar cheques she was receiving from her parents were buying her more and more. “I would feel like I had more money by the end of the month – $50 to $70 a month,” she says. “Coming here, I knew I had to be really careful with my money. But then later, as the price went down, I could be a little more flexible,” she said. Tennessee newlyweds Kevin Maggard and Sharmaine Hunt say they did not come to Italy especially because of the exchange rate, but noted that lots of people at home had mentioned to them that it was a “good time to go. You feel like you can spend a little more money,” Hunt said. On their first day in the Eternal City prices at lunch seemed “reasonable” and they calculated that an €8 dish would only set them back about $10 In Venice, Pam Sammartino, from Denver, Colorado, said the exchange rate had definitely helped her budget, allowing her to stay at a nicer hotel – one with a pool – than she otherwise would have. But Franco, a gondolier, said whatever the exchange rate, people were spending less money than they used to. The day of long lunches and gondola rides have been replaced by take-out pizza by the slice and public transport, he said. France Like hundreds of others, Scott Sohn, a building contractor from southern California and his wife, Cindy, had been queuing for over half an hour to climb the bell tower of Notre Dame Cathedral. “We got here well before opening time to stand in line because in the afternoon the line is twice as long,” he said. The Sohns and their fellow holidaymakers, the Phillipses from Palm Springs, are seasoned travellers from previous trips spent fighting the crowds in Rome. They had seen scores of pre-planned sights from the Normandy D-day beaches to their special queue-jumping pass and guide at the Louvre. “There were such crowds in front of the Mona Lisa that you had to push and shove to get close,” Cindy said. “If I was a first time visitor from the US and I went there on my own, I’m not sure what kind of impression I’d have. There’s a lot of pushing and a lot of tight corners,” Cohn said. At the Louvre, the crowd in front of the Mona Lisa is now almost as famous as the painting. “I took a photo of people taking photos of the Mona Lisa,” said Jon Gabrielson, a major in English and history. Further back in the queue, Rachel Tierney, an English major from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, said the impressionists at the Musée d’Orsay had proved tricky due to the wall of people taking selfies in front of the works of Degas. “You couldn’t see anything, we were 30 feet away from the pantings.” Maggie Finch, an English major in the same group of friends, had been “very surprised” in London to have to queue for half an hour to get a picture of platform nine and three quarters at Kings Cross station. Likewise, Paris’s recently restored gothic chapel La Sainte-Chapelle was stunning “but if you turned around you bumped into other tourists”. Most felt the queues in Paris were small-fry compared to Italy. “Rome was far worse,” sighed a pensioner from Texas waiting to get into Notre Dame.","Id":"business/2015/jun/05/euro-rate-american-tourists-europe-holiday","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webTitle":"Gaining currency: fall of euro has American tourists flocking to Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/05/euro-rate-american-tourists-europe-holiday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/jun/05/euro-rate-american-tourists-europe-holiday","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":1709,"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-05T19:13:29Z","id":"business/2015/jun/05/euro-rate-american-tourists-europe-holiday","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Working lunches around the world: what's in your lunchbox?","body":"Manchester The lunch al desko plague has thankfully yet fully to infect Manchester, where most workers still take a proper break. Drinking at lunch – or dinner, as most people still call the midday meal (tea is what you trough in the evening) – is far from unusual, especially on Fridays, when whole teams hit the pub for a few cheeky pints to welcome the weekend. At Creative Concern, an ethical media agency in the ever fashionable Northern Quarter (NQ), “gin o’clock” is a sacred institution on Fridays at 4pm, joined occasionally by “wine on Wednesdays” if they are having a particularly good (or bad) week. While Manchester’s evening dining options are still not up to London’s standards, the former Cottonopolis excels at cheap lunch eats. Katsouris, a deli on Deansgate, one of the main thoroughfares, has a queue out the door every day, offering a range of hot roast meat sarnies for £3.50 a pop (£4, if you plump for the mutant granary bap), as well as ridiculously large plates of paella and Middle Eastern meze. Philpotts, a superlative sandwich chain originally founded in Chester, puts Pret to shame, though the latter is always hoaching on Cross Street. Manchester is also very good at soup: Shlurp, on Brazennose Street, offers an ever-changing menu of seasonal, locally sourced soups, and is a favourite of council workers at the nearby cavernous town hall. Back in the NQ, there’s a bearded hippy, operating as Lunchbrakes, who arrives on a bicycle and shouts, “Soup and sandwich guy” as he rocks up with a basket and two giant flasks of soup: £1.40 for a small chicken korma soup, £2 for a large. It doesn’t look very inviting – it’s a tiny, no-frills place hidden down a back alley – but it is all about the food “Rice’n’three” is another popular choice, the speciality of a host of deceptively basic-looking takeaway joints that all compete with a range of tasty curries and rice for a fiver. Little Aladdin and This & That, both in the NQ, come recommended, while Phatha Phat, on Butter Lane near the legal district, is popular with lunching lawyers. Many people head to the Arndale shopping centre, bypassing the bland chains of the upstairs food hall for the market on the high street side, where you can eat your way around the world from stall to stall. If the sun’s out (“cracking t’flags” as we say in the north-west), everyone will rush outside and crowd into the few sunspots not overshadowed by Victorian architecture. The town hall’s monument steps offer a great people-watching spot, while the summer lawn in Spinningfields, a new glitzy development around the law courts, is a catwalk on a summer day. HP My lunch: Tom Gilbart, 34, barrister (pictured top left) My brother-in-law David and I are both lawyers. We like having lunch together, but don’t often get the chance because of the demands of our jobs. When we do manage it, we love eating at a “rice’n’three” place. There are a few dotted around the city centre, but our favourite is Phatha Phat. It’s only a few yards away from some of Manchester’s most glamorous restaurants, and I have to admit that it doesn’t look very inviting. It’s a tiny, no-frills place hidden down a back alley, but it is all about the food. Every day, the staff prepare a fresh selection of curries, daals and kebabs, and you take your pick with some rice and a salad. It costs £5 and is great value. Today we’re having slow-cooked lamb nihari, sag aloo, lentil dal, pilau rice, green salad and seekh kebab. At lunch, the place heaves with a wide range of people, and on Thursdays and Fridays you are lucky to get a table. The food is fresh, full of flavour and spicy without being overpowering. This sort of restaurant represents what I love about my home city: friendly and lacking in pretension, but excellent quality. Rome Andrea Zazzara in Rome. Photograph: Chiara Goia for the Guardian Three years ago, the government carried out a survey to find out how many people ate their lunch at home. The answer was 74.3%, a figure that says much about a country in which less than half of women have a paid job; one in which most of the population lives and works in villages, towns or small cities, where employees and employers alike can often get home for lunch and maybe even fit in a pisolino (nap) afterwards. Shopping, or doing any other kind of business, in an Italian provincial town is usually impossible between 1.30 and 3pm. And many establishments don’t reopen till 3.30 or even 4pm. Government ministers have more than once railed against the Italian lunch break, or pausa pranzo. One called it “a ritual that brings the whole of Italy to a stop”. But the picture among city office workers is very different. In Rome, tavola calda establishments, where the food is laid out on a bar, are popular with office workers. Sometimes, it is self-service; sometimes, there is a server haring between tables. But the customers all get to sit down and relax. The right to a lunch break – like almost everything in Italy – is enshrined in a law. The length of break is up to employers, and one survey by an Italian online recruitment agency found that 30% of its clients seldom left their desks at lunchtime, with 60% saying that a shortage of time forced them to rush. Then again, the same survey found more than two-thirds took lunch breaks that lasted an hour or more. JH It’s slow food – I would never eat a sandwich in a bar, absolutely not Andrea Zazzara My lunch: Andrea Zazzara, 43, lawyer I’m normally in court until 1pm or 1.30pm, and then I have to go back to my chambers, so I generally don’t get out to lunch before 2pm. There’s a nice little trattoria nearby, so if I go out with colleagues, we ring ahead and say how many we are. The chef, Pasquale, will then cook us a pasta. But we don’t know what it is. It’s a surprise. He has a lot of imagination and revisits traditional recipes. My favourite is a spaghetti alla carbonara that he makes with tuna and courgette. There’s another fantastic place nearby. There are tables, though not many. It’s slow food, really: nice, healthy ingredients and genuine flavours. It’s a bit like having a meal at home. But it does get very crowded, because this is how Romans particularly like to have lunch. If I don’t have enough time, I’ll go to a place selling pizza al taglio (pizza sold in rectangular slices). But I would never eat a sandwich in a bar. Absolutely not. I think they’re unhealthy. And they might have been prepared somewhere else. New York Amber Hoover in New York. Photograph: Adam Golfer for the Guardian The cliched impressions that outsiders have of New York City are largely false: people aren’t especially rude; life doesn’t move unusually fast, most of the time; in the average neighbourhood, it’s impossible to order takeout food in the middle of the night. Lunchtime in midtown and downtown Manhattan is an exception, though. For those who aren’t stuck with sandwiches or salads at their desks, it’s a genuinely frenetic event, marked by a crazy multiplicity of choices: traditional diners and delis; “fast casual” chains serving burgers, burritos or customised salads composed from a selection of 60 ingredients; plus the new generation of food trucks, serving curries and pad thai, lobster rolls and bacon-flavoured ice-cream. “Haste seems to be a controlling factor in the luncheon of the worker,” declared an article in Munsey’s Magazine in 1901, a few years before “automats” appeared in Times Square, offering pies and cakes from behind individual glass-fronted compartments, to shave off a few more seconds. The automats are gone, but the sense of haste lives on – although it’s recently grown easier to stop and breathe, too, thanks to the increase in pedestrianised areas, peppered with tables and chairs, orchestrated by Michael Bloomberg’s visionary transport commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan. Elsewhere in New York, far grander things are happening at lunchtime: the city was the birthplace of the original “power lunch” (the phrase was probably coined to describe meals at the Four Seasons restaurant, on 52nd Street) and of the uptown, upmarket “ladies who lunch”, a term popularised by New York magazine. For the non-plutocrats, meanwhile, it’s a speedy but crucial change of scenery in the working day, marked by an ever-increasing range of food options. There are a thousand more tranquil places on the planet to eat your lunch, of course, but what New Yorkers know is that plunging into the manic energy of the city for half an hour can be just as restorative. OB \u0007Lunch is, all too frequently, doing whatever I’m doing at my desk Amber Hoover My lunch: Amber Hoover, 37, foreign rights specialist at a publishing firm I’m eating braised beef over spinach, sriracha string beans and some sort of spring greens with onions. And rhubarb tea. From a place called Dig Inn – it’s pretty healthy, I think, and a good way of getting vegetables in my system. They even have a phone app, so I can pay without having to bother with cash. Because I work in publishing, there’s an entertainment element to lunch that happens sometimes – once or twice a week, I’ll have a business lunch, a proper sit-down. The rest of the time, lunch is either like this or, all too frequently, crammed in at my desk while I keep doing whatever I’m doing. Rio de Janeiro Clara Araújo in Rio. Photograph: Lianne Milton for the Guardian Typically, Cariocas [residents of Rio de Janeiro] lunch at a restaurante à quilo, a buffet where the price is determined by the weight of food on the plate. Almost all offer staple Brazilian fare, such as rice, feijão (black beans), meat, farofa (toasted cassava flour) and salgadinhos (a variety of savoury snacks), alongside various other dishes. Brazil has large and long-established Japanese, Italian and Middle Eastern communities, meaning sushi, spaghetti and esfihas (an unleavened bread pasty introduced by immigrants from Syria and Lebanon) are commonplace. Most à quilo restaurants also boast a salad bar. They vary enormously in quality, price and atmosphere, but the high-end ones operate with the efficiency of a well-oiled production line. Customers are given tickets on their way in, form an orderly queue around the buffet, weigh their plates, then sit at a table where one of the waiting staff takes their order for drinks. Plates are cleared as soon as they are empty. Customers then queue again in front of the cashier, before handing their receipt to a member of staff who lurks by the exit. Lunch is often the only meal these restaurants serve, so ensuring a rapid flow of customers is key. For high-end professionals, there are more traditional restaurants with a set menu, but such establishments are relatively rare. At the other end of the scale, there are plenty of lanchonetes, snack bars that serve salgadinhos and fruit juices, where customers generally eat standing up. No one eats at their desk, because it’s considered bad manners, and grossly unhygienic. The importance of the lunch hour is such that the specific timing of the break is often written into contracts. Many workers also get food vouchers as part of their pay, with a daily allowance of about R$20 (£4) loaded on to a credit card, accepted at most à quilo restaurants. Eating out appeals to the Cariocas’ natural sociability, allowing colleagues to spend time together chewing the fat outside the office. BD Leaving the office is important, a chance to nourish myself and my creativity Clara Araújo My lunch: Clara Araújo, 33, journalist for Criar Brasil, a media NGO Today, I’m eating what I usually have for lunch: on one side of the plate I have a bit of salad, because my mother taught me it was important to have something healthy; on the other is the stuff I really like – a slice of meat in mushroom sauce and a couple of esfihas, one filled with meat and the other with cheese. I come to this restaurant regularly with my colleagues. We like it because it’s nearby and the food is varied and excellent value. All the à quilo restaurants in the centre of Rio are busy and noisy at lunchtime, but this place is still kind of intimate. There are even a few booths where couples can sit close together. For me, leaving the office for lunch is important. I don’t cook, so bringing food into work is not an option. I also like to get away from work for a while. Leaving the office gives you a chance to nourish both your belly and your creativity. You get the chance to interact with your colleagues in a different way. Nairobi Jack Okinyi in Nairobi. Photograph: Sven Torfinn for the Guardian Lunch is a raucous and communal affair in the Kenyan capital. For many, it’s an escape from the drudgery of desk jobs, and they gather in the large restaurants around the business district, where they share hour-long sit-down meals. Not too many people have time for a proper breakfast before work. Cut-throat competition in schools means that the kids have to set off for class in the half-light of dawn; adults, too, generally leave home in the early hours, to beat the city’s notorious traffic. Lunch offers a welcome respite. At around midday, office workers troop out, in groups of three or four, and sometimes even seven or eight, to find a good spot in their favourite restaurant. Very few people go out for lunch alone. Local tastes vary, depending on affordability and a region’s culinary traditions. Cuisine from western Kenya is the most widespread, with smoked, fried or whole fish, sometimes stewed in coconut sauce – a popular choice. Those with a more adventurous palate can try boiled tilapia fish head, or chicken, beef or stewed goat tripe (the latter is a favourite at the popular Ranalo Foods downtown). The national dish, nyama choma (goat rib roasted on an open spit), is mostly enjoyed on weekend afternoons with a couple of drinks. Some choose to have their lunch at cafeteria-style restaurants, where they queue and then go out into the sunshine with their plates. But on a recent, unusually chilly Wednesday afternoon (temperatures anywhere below 20C are considered too cold by Nairobians), two sisters who work in computer sales, Marissa Oluchina and Emma Mwongeli, explained that they prefer having lunch at Abu’s Place, located just behind the city’s main mosque, which specialises in coastal dishes. Abu’s mainstay is pilau (rice cooked in a seasoned broth), while Mwongeli names a dish from the mountain region of Kenya as her favourite: “There is nothing as good as a nice plate of githeri [a mix of stewed maize and beans], topped with fresh avocado, to set you off into the afternoon in a good mood.” MM I rarely have time for breakfast or dinner, so lunch is important. I always eat with a friend or two Jack Okinyi My lunch: Jack Okinyi, 40, owner of a social media consultancy I rarely have time for dinner or even breakfast, so for me lunch is the most important meal. I usually grab a snack at dinner time (or sometimes forget to), but I can never miss lunch. I work in downtown Nairobi, so most of the time I take my lunch there. My favourite restaurant is Ranalo Foods, which specialises in the traditional cuisine of my Luo people; Barack Obama Sr is one of our more famous kinsmen. Most of the time, I have fish and a brown millet cake known as ugali. The fish can be deep-fried, smoked or boiled, but it is always tilapia. The restaurant sources it from the freshwater Lake Victoria, which has very tasty fish. I always eat with a friend or two, since I do not enjoy eating alone. My favourite lunch is deep-fried whole tilapia with osuga (wild vegetables in cream) and brown ugali. At KSh 750 (about £5), the meal is relatively expensive, but the restaurant is very clean and the service is world class. Beijing Zhang Tong in Beijing. Photograph: James Wasserman for the Guardian When it comes to a working lunch in Beijing, you can’t beat the baozi, or Chinese steamed bun. Legend has it taht the baozi was invented more than 1,800 years ago by Zhuge Liang, a Chinese statesman and military strategist who is also credited with creating the wheelbarrow. Facing crisis when his hungry, dehydrated soldiers began to fall ill, Zhuge dreamed up the idea of making doughy, human head-shaped buns packed with pork and beef. They are said to have cured his sick warriors and guaranteed subsequent battlefield success. Today, baozi can be found the length and breadth of China, and are eaten morning, noon and night by those in search of a quick, nutritious and filling snack. In China’s capital, where office workers generally get 45 minutes to an hour for their break, a lunch on the run means a trip to somewhere such as the Qingfeng Steamed Stuffed Bun Shop. With 290 outlets, Qingfeng is one of the city’s top bun makers, churning out 16 tonnes of baozi each day for famished Beijingers. The baozi is so much a part of popular culture that even president Xi Jinping popped into one of Qingfeng’s shops in an attempt to burnish his man-of-the-people credentials. The restaurant subsequently created the “Zhu xi tao can” or “President Xi Jinping combo” meal, which includes buns stuffed with onion and pork, stir-fried pig liver and intestine, and a plate of greens. There are pork and spring onion buns, pork and cabbage buns, prawn and vegetable buns, and vegetarian buns, each costing up to 4.5 yuan (46p). Also on the menu are bowls of pumpkin porridge – a snip at 3 yuan (30p) – pork and spring onion buns, which cost 3.5 yuan each (36p), and bowls of spicy cold noodles that sell for 9 yuan (92p). TP Additional reporting by Luna Lin It’s fast, it tastes OK and it’s safe. I look for fast-food chains that are clean and tidy Zhang Tong My lunch: Zhang Tong, 43, insurance salesman I’ll have steamed buns three or four times a week, and usually I’ll have six or nine buns a time – they’re made of flour and are stuffed with vegetables or meat. There are vegetarian ones, shrimp ones and pork ones, too. They cost 15-20 yuan (£1.50-£2). It is fast food, it tastes OK and it’s safe. Because of all the food scandals in China, I look for restaurants that are clean and tidy. In Beijing, common folk also go to restaurants that sell zhajiang mian – fried sauce noodles. There’s one just around the corner from here. The food is great, but the restaurant isn’t so clean. Sometimes I will eat with my colleagues and sometimes I dine alone – Chinese fast food chains are my go-to choices. I usually spend about 30 minutes having lunch. I hardly ever eat at my desk, because my job requires me to spend most of my working hours outside the office.","Id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/lunches-around-the-world-summer-food-special","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webTitle":"Working lunches around the world: what's in your lunchbox?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/lunches-around-the-world-summer-food-special","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/lunches-around-the-world-summer-food-special","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":3049,"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T10:00:10Z","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/lunches-around-the-world-summer-food-special","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"The Pope washes of the feet of young offenders in Rome","body":"We had all been told, about a month beforehand, that Pope Francis was coming to the Casal del Marmo youth detention centre in Rome, but no one really believed it until he showed up.

A group of detainees were due to sit down and have their feet washed by Francis. I knew the story of how Jesus washed the feet of his disciples and that was what Francis wanted to recreate.

The German polymath Goethe would have approved of that because on his first journey to Italy, in autumn 1786, he had barely crossed the Alps before he started enthusing about the food. He then enthused about painting, sculpture, ruins and, ultimately, the entire classical achievement. His colleagues of the Enlightenment were happy to concur and ever since then we have tended to draw a line through history that makes us the heirs of ancient Rome and beyond it, Greece. Michael Pye thinks we owe a greater debt elsewhere and has written a book to support this idea. A conventional view of history has the dark ages beginning with the decline of Rome in the 400s and the lights not coming back on until the Renaissance a millennium later. But it has become increasingly fashionable to wonder whether there wasn’t something going on in all that time, and Michael Pye is certainly not the first to shine a light into the gloom. But no book I have read, nor any that I spotted in Pye’s 50 pages of references, has looked at the available evidence in the way it is presented here. The title, however, should more exactly refer to “the edge of the Roman world” for this is where the North Sea sits, in many places well beyond the imperial frontier. And that is important to Pye’s thesis for he claims that it was those people who lived beyond the imperial reach who created the circumstances and the tools for what we consider modernity. It starts with the Frisians, with a change of climate and the fall of Rome. Pliny the Younger had mentioned that there were people on the edge of the world who lived cut off from the mainland by marshes. They were sea people, he announced, and all they had in their lives was fish, so they were not worth conquering. They were sea people for a reason, because in that region, at that time, it was quicker to travel on water than land. Seven hundred years later, the bishop of nearby Utrecht was similarly dismissive. “And yet,” Pye writes, “between the writing of those two accounts the Frisians reinvented all the links and ties across the North Sea.” The challenge to accepted dark age theories implicit in that sentence runs through the book and is usually followed, as in this case, by something even more surprising: the Frisians, Pye tells us, “reinvented money”. And that reinvention was something of a revolution, and one that speaks directly to us, because the way they used money, instead of barter or a straight equivalent in precious metals, required both buyer and seller to accept the abstract idea of value. And once you had abstract values, you had mathematics, and then it wasn’t long before there was a market. And once there was a market, as we all know in our post-crash world, there was the possibility of leverage, of fiddling values and exploiting the market. The Edge of the World does several things at once. It tells some of the history of the North Sea and its peoples. It traces the development of several things that came out of that sea, among them the idea that one could shape the world to one’s needs, that women could make key choices in their lives, that law was power and, by extension, that lawmakers and practitioners were powerful. And it challenges the notion that we owe our world to the ancients and the Renaissance. “We are not on the margins of history any more,” Pye concludes after looking at the golden age of cities such as Antwerp and Amsterdam, pointing to “the changes of mind that made our world possible”. All of which invites the question: are we the heirs of ancient Rome, of the Mediterranean world, or of not-so-ancient Frisia and the North Sea? The argument here is clearly the latter and if there is a problem with the assertion it is that it has been made too loudly, too eloquently. Pye draws on an extraordinary range of sources, from an essay on the emergence of bathing culture in Scarborough to a study of Viking references in medieval Irish literature. The Venerable Bede has a walk-on part, as too do Charlemagne and Cosimo de’ Medici, whose Renaissance rooms were “wrapped in Flemish taste”. More fascinating are the voices of less-known characters and Pye delights in bringing them back to the light, among them Robert Grosseteste, bishop of Lincoln, and Katelijne Vedelaer, a pretty Beguine from 14th-century Bruges who fought off wealthy abductors and insisted on her rights. Doubts remain about the argument – it would be good to know more about how these developments clashed with or complemented the achievements of the Arabs – but in spite of that the result is more lasagne than pickled herring, a multilayered, complicated, dense book that demands time to read and be digested but rewards by giving one plenty to chew on.

Also free at weekends (although it’s $5 on weekdays) is the Ikea ferry that runs from Wall Street to the Swedish furniture store in Red Hook, Brooklyn, and the East River ferry from Manhattan to Brooklyn ($4 weekdays, $6 weekends) is another scenic option. If you do decide you want to splash out, the Circle line ferry, which circumnavigates Manhattan island in two-and-a-half hours for $41, really gives you a comprehensive perspective on the city. Budget accommodation Bowery House hotel-hostel in Nolita Photograph: PR Related: Buffalo stance: New York state’s forgotten city is coming in from the cold Accommodation costs in New York can be as high as the city’s famous skyscrapers, but there are usually some bargains to be had among the array of properties available for holiday let on Airbnb, particularly if you avoid Manhattan. A bargain probably still means $100 a night for an apartment but, if you are willing to stay in a room in someone’s place, rather than having an apartment to yourself, you can cut the price to under $60. A flat-swap website such as HomeExchange is another option, although it’s obviously not for everyone. If you don’t fancy staying in an apartment, rooms at the Bowery House hotel-hostel in Nolita start at $109 a night for a double, while the summer rates at the Chelsea International Hostel on West 20th Street start at $75 for a single room with a shared bathroom, $140 for a private en suite double and $62 a person to stay in a dorm. Don’t forget the tip Waverly Restaurant, Greenwich Village. Photograph: Alamy Related: Eating out in New York City – by Instagram For the classic American diner experience, sit yourself down in one of the red-leather booths of the Waverly restaurant (cheeseburger $8.05) in Greenwich Village. Or if you want a wider selection head to Williamsburg on a Saturday or Brooklyn Bridge Park on a Sunday to visit Smorgasburg, an increasingly popular collection of open-air food stalls. Restaurants can be pricey in New York – especially once you factor in the mandatory 15%-20% tip – but Gruppo in Alphabet City is a good option for inexpensive and very tasty thin-crust pizza, and Cafe Argentino (499 Grand Street, +1 718 782 9477) in Williamsburg offers a $10 brunch. And if the well really has run dry, most delis offer a selection of cooked meals, usually charged by weight. For a cheap drink, try the Peter McManus Cafe in Chelsea, a friendly Irish pub where the bar staff will often give you a round on the house, or Jimmy’s Corner near Times Square, the best bar in that area. Get up on the roof Rooftop bar at 230 Fifth. Photograph: Alamy Related: Crime writer Jeffery Deaver on the unexpected side of New York City New York was made to be seen from up high but, unfortunately, the observation decks of the Empire State Building ($32), the Rockefeller Center ($30), and the new 1 World Trade Center ($32) will all set you back a pretty penny. Another option is to go to a rooftop bar and make a drink or two last while you enjoy the view. The best in town is the Standard hotel in the Meatpacking District, which has a beautiful copper-coloured bar on the top floor and a busy roof garden overlooking the Hudson River. The staff can be a bit sniffy about who gets in – in the evening – but they’re friendlier in the afternoon. Also worth trying is 230 Fifth in Midtown, while in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the Wythe hotel has a sweeping view across the East river of the Manhattan skyline. It’s unbeatable in the early evening as the sun goes down. A stroll in the park The High Line. Photograph: Sylvain Sonnet/Getty Images Related: Gowanus, Brooklyn’s former industrial hub, is cleaning up its act The decade-long effort by two Chelsea residents, Joshua David and Robert Hammond, to transform the abandoned and overgrown tracks of the old elevated freight train line along the city’s west side into a “park in the sky” - the High Line - has blossomed into one of New York’s most popular attractions. Strolling above the traffic among the semi-wild meadow plants – meant to evoke the decades when the tracks had reverted back to nature – provides a peaceful respite from the hustle and bustle of the city below, and there’s something rather European about promenading from one end to the other, not in order to arrive at any particular destination, but simply for the joy of it. Central Park gives you even more of feeling of having been suddenly removed from the city; its 840 acres include a reservoir, a boating lake, sports fields, a zoo and more, and the line of Midtown towers framing its woods, meadows and gardens to the south is a quintessential New York view. Prospect Park in Brooklyn is not much smaller and includes the beautiful cherry trees of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Pay what you wish for art Metropolitan Museum of Art. Photograph: Sylvain Sonnet/Getty Images Related: New York's historic Kings Theatre grand reopening – in pictures They don’t like to shout about it but the $25 fee to enter the prestigious Metropolitan Museum of Art in Central Park is actually a “recommended” amount: you can pay what you wish. John Singer Sargent’s portraits of the members of his artistic circle – including Monet, Rodin and Henry James – are on display at the moment, while the permanent collection covering Greece, Rome, Egypt and European and American art is unmissable. The Whitney Museum of American Art, which has just reopened in a brand-new building at the southern end of the High Line, also allows you to pay what you wish on Fridays between 7pm and 10pm. Its opening exhibition is a stunning survey of the US art scene from the beginning of the 20th century to today, while New York and New Jersey are themselves framed and presented as works of art through the huge glass windows at the east and west sides of the building. The Museum of Modern Art on 53rd Street is also free on Fridays from 4pm. Don’t miss Jacob Lawrence’s striking Migration Series: the story of African-Americans’ journey north in the wake of the first and second world wars, told through 60 tempera panels painted in vivid blocks of colour. Get some exercise A Citi Bike station in Manhattan. Photograph: Alamy Related: Concierge Dwight Owsley on New York City During the sweltering summer, the city opens dozens of free outdoor swimming pools across the five boroughs, many of them enormous. Asser Levy pool on East 23rd Street might be a good place to start. If you prefer a cycle ride, you could try picking up a Citi Bike from the city’s on-street cycle-hire scheme. There are stations spread across Manhattan below 60th Street, and in several areas of Brooklyn including Williamsburg, Brooklyn Heights and Fort Greene. Twenty-four hour access costs $9.95 although, if a single journey lasts longer than 30 minutes, you begin to rack up extra fees. For a longer ride, you would be better off hiring a bike from one of the numerous cycle shops in the city. At NYC Velo on Second Avenue in the East Village, or 11th Avenue in Hell’s Kitchen, prices start at $30 for 24 hours. The most enjoyable and safest trip is along the cycle path that runs up the whole west side of Manhattan, along the Hudson River – it’s a scenic journey that ends at the George Washington bridge, underneath which you will find the Little Red Lighthouse immortalised in Hildegarde Swift’s 1942 children’s book. Go for a walk Cafe Wha? in Greenwich Village. Photograph: Alamy Related: Swimming in New York: community pools and conversation Free Tours by Foot offers numerous tours of Manhattan and Brooklyn, including a ghost walk, a Williamsburg street-art tour, and tours of Harlem, Little Italy and Chinatown. I’d recommend the tour of Greenwich Village, which tells the story of the founding of this patchwork of dappled downtown streets by the Dutch as Groenwijck (Green District) in the 17th century up to its heyday as the home of the 1960s folk scene, taking in Cafe Wha? and the apartment where Bob Dylan wrote Blowin’ in the Wind. The tour also looks at the Village’s key part in the struggle for gay rights following the Stonewall riots in 1969, and you’ll also see an open-air swimming pool that the young Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro used to break into at night, right across the street from a house where Marlon Brando once kept a raccoon in the bathtub. As with many supposedly free walking tours, you’re encouraged to tip the guide at the end: $10 or $20 seems to be the going rate. Cross the Brooklyn bridge Photograph: Alamy One of New York’s most recognisable landmarks, the Brooklyn bridge was built in 1883, and its limestone and granite neo-gothic towers make it far more imposing than the steel bridges that followed it further up the East river. The bridge’s pedestrian and cycle pathway is elevated, so it offers fantastic views of the Manhattan skyline and downtown Brooklyn. It can be a bit of a scrum on there sometimes as tourists stop for photos and to attach love locks to its metal latticework fencing – so walking across may take longer than you think. If you cross from Manhattan to Brooklyn, walk down through the Dumbo district afterwards and have a coffee or an ice-cream in Brooklyn Bridge Park, which runs along the shoreline and currently features an enjoyable sculpture exhibition by Jeppe Hein called Please Touch the Art. Visit the 9/11 memorial Photograph: Alamy While the September 11 attack has already passed into history as the geopolitical turning point of the early 21st century, the 9/11 memorial (tickets for the museum cost $24 for adults, free on Tuesdays from 5pm) by architect Michael Arad and landscape architect Peter Walker successfully turns the focus back on to the nearly 3,000 people who died in the atrocity. The memorial consists of two enormous waterfalls pouring into the foundations where the Twin Towers once stood, with the names of the victims cut into a metal rim around them. It communicates a powerful sense of loss and absence.","Id":"travel/2015/jul/28/10-best-ways-to-enjoy-new-york-on-a-budget","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webTitle":"10 of the best ways to enjoy New York … on a budget","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jul/28/10-best-ways-to-enjoy-new-york-on-a-budget","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2015/jul/28/10-best-ways-to-enjoy-new-york-on-a-budget","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":1646,"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-28T05:30:07Z","id":"travel/2015/jul/28/10-best-ways-to-enjoy-new-york-on-a-budget","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"The pizza revolution: the staples from Naples","body":"There's a pizza revolution going on – and it doesn't involve pineapple or hotdog-stuffed crusts. Authentic, Neapolitan-style pizzas are winning over an army of British fans thanks to mini-chains such as Franco Manca and Rossopomodoro in London and Birmingham, independents PizzaFace in Brighton and La Favorita in Edinburgh, and street food crews Homeslice and Pizza Pilgrims, both of which have recently opened restaurants. (Pizza Pilgrims has also published a cookbook.) Why does it matter? Because Naples is the spiritual home of the pizza. While Rome has its pizza al taglio (by the slice), Chicago its deep-dish, and every high street in Britain its Sloppy Giuseppe and American Hot, Naples gave the world what the Oxford Companion to Food terms \"the archetype of modern pizzas\". The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana produces a mind-bendingly long and precise booklet about what constitutes an authentic Napoletana pizza, with edicts on acceptable toppings (sorry, no pineapple). But for British producers of Neapolitan-style pizzas, what matters are the quality ingredients and techniques: 00 flour, Italian tinned tomatoes (preferably San Marzano), fresh basil and firm fior di latte (mozzarella made from cow's milk) in the case of a classic margherita. The dough is left to rise slowly, then cooked for 60 to 90 seconds in a blisteringly hot wood-fired oven. The bases should be thin and softer in the middle of the circle, with a puffy cornicione (crust). To many, all this marks a sea change from the chains. \"When Francos [the forerunner of Franco Manca] opened in 1987, there was no one else doing authentic Neapolitan pizzas,\" says Sami Wasif, co-founder with Giuseppe Mascoli of Franco Manca and owner of Eco pizza. \"It was all Pizza Hut and Pizzaland.\" Franco Manca developed a cult following for its delicious cornicione and sourdough bases, which Wasif says are \"easily digestible\" thanks to the dough's slow fermentation. \"The big chains do things cheaper. They use big quantities of dry yeast plus other agents to accelerate the dough fermentation, and tend to buy cheap cheese,\" he says. Not that chain pizza is without its merits. \"Cheese, dough, tomatoes and meat together is never bad,\" says Thom Elliot of Pizza Pilgrims, who says he has a \"great place in my heart for Pizza Express\". But Pizza Pilgrims and Franco Manca hope to elevate what can be an average dish into a truly memorable one. Franco Manca leaves its sourdough to rise for at least 20 hours before baking it at 500C in a custom-built oven made by \"artisans from Naples\". Thom and James Elliot of Pizza Pilgrims earned their merit badges by taking a six-week road trip around Italy, meeting pizzaioli and collecting traditional recipes. \"Neapolitan gets used to mean an indicator of quality rather than referring to a specific style,\" says Thom Elliot. In other words, unless there is a wood-fired oven on full blast behind the bakery counter, it isn't a Neapolitan-style pizza.

Now a small chain, with five London branches, Franco Manca's original outlet in Brixton market is a shrine to pizza minimalism with its sparse decor and short menu.

Thanks to its wood-fired ovens and a dough recipe inherited from a Tuscan monk (it's a long story), its pizzas are a palpable cut above. Their elegantly thin, airy bases have real character, reassuring char and, if arguably they are a little crisp, plenty of fresh chew, too. Gusto's loosely pulped tomato sauce is unusually vibrant. Quality toppings seal the deal. Tony Naylor Santa Maria, Ealing 12in pizza from £5.45 santamariapizzeria.com Santa Maria's margherita pizza.

Paper-thin in the middle and patched with char, Santa Maria's easily digested, springy bases are topped with A1 imported ingredients. Once you fold your slice of its buffalo mozzarella bufalina, it's like eating a sandwich of the sweetest tomatoes and double cream. Best pizza in London? Quite possibly.

All the usual toppings, plus some novelties – radicchio, figs, baby spinach, parsley pesto, nduja sausage.

While the menu veers alarmingly into novelty territory (tandoori chicken pizza, anyone?), the simpler options are more than acceptable. The Cotto is covered in gooey mozzarella and firm, salty chunks of pancetta, on top of a sweet tomato sauce. While the base is pale and tastes a little doughy in places, there are good patches of char on the crust.

So, do said pizzas live up to the hype? Resoundingly so. The Bufala is dotted with Buffalo mozzarella – creamy and slightly golden from the oven. The sauce, made simply from crushed San Marzanos, tastes like purest essence of tomato, and the chewy, charred crust contrasts nicely with the soft middle.

We wandered down the back alleys of town, past a man in a hot pink three-piece suit, his little finger accessoriesed with a heavy gold signet ring. He was sitting in the front of a funeral parlour shouting into his mobile phone. Teenagers, sometimes three to a moped, hair gelled against the wind, overtook us at high speeds. In front of buildings decked with washing lines, grannies in housedresses and worn slippers stopped their gossiping for a quick pinch of my son's fat cheeks. We navigated past dark storefronts, dilapidated but still gorgeous grand palazzos, and more than a couple of overflowing rubbish bins. The gritty, cinematic scenes seemed plucked out of Rio or Mexico City, rather than Italy, especially when contrasted with well-ordered Tuscany, where we live, and where pretty, ordered tableaux seem arranged purely for photo shoots, and rubbish disappears as seamlessly as the day. But for me, as for many who fall in love with the city, it is the contrasts of Naples that appeal – it's a rebellious but beautiful place with layers of ancient art, a chaos that is almost soap operatic, and a determination to thrive even when things seem to be falling apart. But in the eyes of a new generation of entrepreneurs trying to showcase the city for tourists and citizens alike, Naples is far more than a caricature of itself. One of them, mayor Luigi de Magistris, has quickly become a symbol for the innovators, looking beyond the city's clichés and bringing a bit more order while preserving its antique treasures. Back-street driver … a couple on a Vespa in Naples and the Capodimonte museum, home to one of the world’s most underrated art collections. Photograph: Alamy Photograph: Alamy In fact, since de Magistris was elected in 2011, the city has gone through a noticeable shift: traffic restrictions on the waterfront and in the historic centre have made it easier to navigate, and the mayor's commitment to recycling has eased the rubbish problem. Just as importantly, his determination to pull apart the corrupt power structures (consider him a leftist in the same vein as Matteo Renzi, the new prime minister) has created a sense of civic pride. Volunteers are helping clean and maintain the city's gardens and squares alongside beleaguered municipal workers, who have felt the budget crunch more than in other parts of Italy. As a result of this mood change, cultural landmarks such as the Capodimonte museum have stepped into the spotlight. Set in magnificent gardens that were once the hunting preserve of the Bourbons, the Capodimonte, which opened in its current incarnation in 1840, has one of the world's most underrated art collections. Unlike in more famous spots, where it can be hard to see the art for the throngs, here you can enjoy masterpieces such as Caravaggio's the Flagellation, Titian's Danaë with Eros, and Breughel Senior's the Blind Leading the Blind – almost alone. And it's not just the ancient that's getting attention. Underneath the city, an innovative scheme to use metro stops as art installations has become one of the most talked-about projects in Italy. Due for completion in 2015, it was curated by Achille Bonito Oliva, a former director of the Venice Biennale. He commissioned more than 100 artists and architects to help transform the city's metro stations into a city-wide museum (metro.na.it). The Neapolitan line … Gae Aulenti’s art installation at Dante metro station Photograph: Alamy Photograph: Alamy The 11 stations completed so far include a psychedelic design by Karim Rashid for Università station, Gae Aulenti's complex of glass and steel at Dante, and the jaw-dropping Toledo stop, designed by Catalan architect Oscar Tusquets Blanca. This ethereal space includes a particularly evocative escalator climbing into a light-panelled seascape by Robert Wilson. Other artists involved include Sol LeWitt, Joseph Kosuth, and William Kentridge. Above ground, the Madre contemporary art gallery in the Donnaregina palace was one of the first of a new generation of museums in Italy (like the Zaha Hadid-designed Maxxi in Rome) with site-specific installations from artists such as Richard Serra, Jeff Koons and Anish Kapoor, and two rooms of frescos by influential Naples-born artist Francesco Clemente. The city's growing reputation for contemporary art has also attracted exciting private galleries and dealers. The Lia Rumma gallery, for example, is a new spot with a decidedly modern agenda. The whitewashed space, with its soaring ceilings, features the likes of Anselm Kiefer, Vanessa Beecroft, Marina Abramovic, as well as Kentridge, among its contemporary heavyweights. A couple on a Vespa in old Naples. Photograph: Alamy Photograph: Alamy The gallery is in the Chiaia district, with grand 19th century buildings running down to the waterfront. Here creative businesses have turned the mostly residential area into a model of revitalization: locals congregate at bar and restaurant Crudorè, round the corner on Piazza Vittoria, for great seafood and views, or for an espresso a short walk north at Anhelo, a two-year-old cafe with great home-roasted beans. An outpost of one of the Naples' most famous pizza spots, Sorbillo has just opened on the seafront Via Partenope. To feel at home in the neighbourhood, try a stay at the stylish three-bedroom Micalò hotel (rooms from €140 B&B). On my last trip to Naples, I based myself at the luxurious Romeo hotel (rooms from €160 a night) right by the port on Via Cristoforo Colombo. Its sleek rooftop pool offered a bird's eye view of the sea, the ferries setting out for Capri and, in the distance, Mount Vesuvius itself. Inside, the owners' contemporary art collection dazzled alongside a sushi bar and a beautiful, quiet spa. The whole property exemplifies a new kind of Naples, but I almost felt relieved when I walked outside. Vespas were whizzing by and jovial restaurant owners straight out of central casting were calling out to us to try their catch of the day. I don't want my beloved city getting too modern or sanitised after all – it's still all about the character, and layers of new and old.","Id":"travel/2014/apr/26/naples-napoli-new-art-scene","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webTitle":"See Naples and … you'll find a city on the rise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/apr/26/naples-napoli-new-art-scene","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2014/apr/26/naples-napoli-new-art-scene","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":980,"webPublicationDate":"2014-04-26T05:00:00Z","id":"travel/2014/apr/26/naples-napoli-new-art-scene","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Holidays in Italy – live Q&A","body":"From Rome's epic ruins to the cinematic beauty of Venice's canals and palazzos; from the mist-shrouded Tuscan hills to the atmospheric baroque towns of Puglia … with so much loveliness to choose from, it can be hard deciding where to holiday in Italy.

No celebration from the Democrats, who were the projected winners but came out sore losers. Nor from the seven million voters (down from 13 million in 2008) who still chose Silvio Berlusconi and then became invisible – almost no one admits to having voted for the disgraced former prime minister. There was not even any celebration from the real winners, the militants and voters of the Movimento 5 Stelle (Five Stars? How did Italy end up with a populist party whose name sounds like a luxury hotel chain?). Without securing a parliamentary majority, it is now the leading party in the Camera dei Deputati, and the second in the senate. But, contrary to national tradition, the movement's supporters did not meet in piazzas, they did not take to the streets honking their car horns, they did not gather outside the party's headquarters opening bottles of sparkling wine. Beppe Grillo's movement voters are recession-stricken and don't find a great deal to celebrate. Also, nobody knows, or much cares, where the party headquarters are actually based. Out of a sort of desperation, a few militants and many more reporters stood outside the former comedian's villa on the outskirts of Genoa, while at the Bar del Fico, in central Rome, about 100 Grillini ate pizza and drank house wine. In truth, many supporters, as well as shell-shocked citizens, remained online, posting comments on Grillo's blog, on Facebook, or on Twitter. In short, the quasi-winners did not seem too enthusiastic or hopeful; the losers were puzzled; and the path to a new government remains an enigma. Many Grillo voters already disagree with him and want him to support a minority cabinet with a short-term reform agenda led by a leader from the Democrats. Many former Grillo-haters show sudden admiration for his stamina and his success. However, our economy is not getting any better; but, along with a post-election Grillo hangover, we are at least now having an interesting – if scary – national conversation. No, we're not Greece. We're much bigger, and weirder. In Rome, we are without a prime minister (and pope); and with a president (the very worried Giorgio Napolitano) and a mayor (the much-criticized Gianni Alemanno) in the last weeks of their mandate. There are scarce hopes of political stability in the near future. Everybody saw the Grillo tsunami coming; everybody knew about people of all sorts – mostly impoverished, out of work, underemployed; but also over-educated, experienced and close to the ruling class – who were coming out in support for him. But many kept believing in the pollsters who erroneously predicted a clear if narrow victory of the centre-left coalition. Grillo has been attacked for his right-leaning outpourings about immigrants, women and trade unions. But among the 162 newly-elected 5 Stelle MPs there are 62 women; and the Grillini are, for the most part, young former left-wingers, environmentalists and local activists who had been ignored by the self-important and self-deceiving Democratic party leadership. Democrats are traumatised, but it looks like they are once more failing to learn their lesson. They're openly fighting each other. Some support a suicidal coalition with Berlusconi's Popolo delle Libertà. Some are desperately trying to start a dialogue with the 5 Stelle, which means exclusively with Grillo and his advisor-consultant-guru Gianroberto Casaleggio, who keeps humiliating them. Some want President Napolitano to appoint Grillo as prime minister. And some keep commuting around Rome in chauffeur-driven luxury cars, fuelling the resentment against the Casta, the often corrupt and always overpaid political caste. The other caste – CEOs, industrialists, wealthy professionals, and pundits who abhorred Grillo until the end of last week, are now praising him. He has been declared \"a Shakespearean fool, the only one who can say what others can't\" and \"an antidote to the proliferation of neo-Nazi movements which took hold of Hungary and Greece\". Leonardo Del Vecchio, the founder of Luxottica, a global eyewear company, even backed a Grillo cabinet: \"I don't think he's more stupid than the prime ministers we had in the past.\" Some endorsement! As the novelist and playwright Ennio Flaiano used to say: \"Italians tend to rush to help the winner.\" Some have decided to bet on him after suffering several other political delusions. Others have just decided to go with the pro-Grillo flow. Others are perplexed when they hear the new Grillini MPs telling reporters that they have no idea how the president is elected and they don't know where the senate is located. Nobody can predict how long all this will last, and what will happen next. Some real Grillo voters appear even less convinced than Del Vecchio. More than 100,000 of them signed an online petition launched by Viola Tesi, a PhD student, waitress and 5 Stelle supporter from Florence, to ask Grillo to negotiate with the Democrats. And many more agree. Others, the holier-than-thou Grillini, insist on fighting online, abusing dissenters. Italian-speakers might enjoy Libernazione.it, a website that has an automatic generator of Grillini insults, mostly about banks, subservient media, freemasons and corrupt politicians. The newly elected Grillini will be trained by a former MP who is under investigation – the picturesque Francesco Barbato. Grillo likes him and has called him \"a warrior\". Barbato's apprentices are expected to share apartments, give back most of their parliamentary salary, and follow the rules posted on Grillo's blog, apparently written by someone fond of 1984's Orwellian Newspeak: \"The members of Parliament are obliged to conform to the Statute, which will be named the Non-Statute.\" Alongside the Non-Statute, most Italians are expecting a Non-Government: a phase of turmoil that will end up, not with a revolution but – in a best-case scenario – with some resignations, a few reforms and new elections. The average Grillo voter is as pessimistic as any other depressed European. She generally says: \"I'm not a big Grillo fan. I voted for him because I support some of his proposals, but mostly because I wanted to send home our bankrupt political class.\" As I write, the only resignation has come from Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. On Thursday, he took off from St Peter's Square in a helicopter, \"flying over a crazy Rome\", wrote Francesco Merlo on the daily newspaper La Repubblica. It will probably get even crazier soon, and somewhat less stylish.

I’ve been a political activist and community organizer my whole life. I’m Palestinian, I’m a refugee. I’m Russian. I’m Muslim. I’m a woman. I care about radically transforming communities to make them healthier and safer. I’ve grown up all over this country. Inequality is increasing dramatically and I see it in my community every day. She was born in Palestine, came to Baltimore as a refugee. Trump started the movement to identify refugees as a threat. To associate politically and culturally and socially people who have been abandoned by every safety net in their societies and have absolutely nowhere to go. Being someone who knows what that feels like, being the first world where there’s so much wealth, I know that we have an obligation to just be human to one another. And I don’t think we’re meeting that obligation.

Tens of thousands were expected to mass on the National Mall for the Women’s March on Washington to send a message to the president-elect that their rights would not be compromised. The crowds, bringing women and men from all across the country, packed into buses and trains en route to the spot where Trump was sworn in on Friday as the next US president. Many of them donned so-called “pussy hats”, pink knit hats with mini ears that served as a rebuke of the video leaked during the presidential campaign showing Trump boasting of sexually assaulting women. They brandished signs with Hillary Clinton’s memorable statement as first lady that “women’s rights are equal rights” and labeling themselves “nasty women”, a reference to Trump’s jab on the debate stage against the first woman presidential nominee. The tone stood in stark contrast to Friday, when widespread protests to Trump’s inauguration occasionally erupted into clashes with police. The security presence was notably lighter on Saturday, befitting the day’s mood. Parents hoisted young children on their shoulders, while others arrived with babies in tow dressed for the occasion. Car horns sounded as drivers passing by the crowds expressed their approval. Strangers cheered at one another from across the street, waving signs related to women’s issues and more. There were pro-LGBT banners, posters declaring refugees “humans, not terrorists”, and vows that the people would rise alongside sea levels. “Hopefully this day is going to be a launch for an ongoing coming together to stand up for our rights, not just as women but as humans,” said Gael Murphy, a co-founder of Code Pink, the left-leaning grassroots organization describing its mission as promoting peace and social justice. “I personally don’t think that Trump is a legitimate president,” she added, citing Russian interference in the US election and structure of the electoral college. “He has done nothing to prepare for the job,” Murphy said. “But we’re here and we’re not going anywhere.

The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) published its response to a consultation on child tax credit exemptions on Friday, and women’s groups have condemned its contents. Rachel Krys, co-director of the End Violence Against Women (EVAW) coalition, said: “We are profoundly disappointed to see the publication of these new rules which make entitlement to child tax credit dependent on ‘proving’ rape. “The obvious difficulty of requiring women to identify a child as a ‘product’ of rape, and then having a third party verify this claim, should have been enough to force a complete rethink of the whole policy proposal. “It’s well known that women are reluctant to disclose rape to anyone, for many reasons including fear and self-protection, guilt, shame and concern for the impact of the knowledge on other family members. Requiring disclosure to officialdom in order to receive support for children is asking women to trust and depend on someone they may prefer not to.” Women’s groups also said they were concerned that the government’s response rejected exempting women who still live with their perpetrator on the grounds that it “would allow the alleged perpetrator to financially benefit from the abuse.” Krys said: “This whole policy betrays a lack of understanding about sexual and domestic abuse. Leading figures in this government have previously worked to try to improve justice outcomes for rape survivors, so it is extremely sad to see the insistence on this woman-judging measure by the DWP.” Updated at 2.31pm GMT 2.22pm GMT My colleague, Elena Cresci, says the atmosphere in London is “really jubilant” rather than angry.

The event begins in Manchester’s Albert Square at 1pm and will last until 3pm. The rally will include a minute’s silence to remember “women lost and those at risk without the luxury of free speech”. Just around the corner is St Peter’s Square, where a statue of Emmeline Pankhurst is due to be unveiled on International Women’s Day 2019. Jen Langton. Photograph: Frances Perraudin/The Guardian Jen Langton, 33, a singer and vocal coach, organised today’s rally in Manchester. She says she didn’t have the means to travel to a protest in another city, so she decided to organise one herself. “Sometimes when people are saying that somebody should do something, that person is you,” she says. “I thought that if I didn’t do something, nobody might. “A lot of people have been asking why we are doing this, because we’re not the USA. First of all, there are a lot of American students in Manchester who don’t have anywhere to go. But it’s also about showing solidarity. English-speaking countries do tend to take their cues from each other and there has been a lot of talk about the similarities between the new presidency and the state of affairs in British politics.” She says the rally is not partisan and Trump is a symptom of the trends they are protesting against, though she admits the billionaire’s inauguration has acted as a catalyst to get people out on to the streets. “To think that a person who openly supports molesting women for fun now has an international platform on which to espouse that kind of hatred is horrific, and if you don’t speak up about it when it happens elsewhere it will start to happen to you, in your country. It’s not enough to say it’s not us, it’s not here, it’s not happening in my town.” Louise Westcott with friends and family. Photograph: Frances Perraudin/The Guardian Louise Westcott, 39, has come to today’s women’s march in Manchester with her husband and two young children, aged six and three. “It’s important to show solidarity with what’s happening in the US. It’s a bit of a dark time at the moment.” She says the rally is about more than just Trump. “It feels like there are a lot of bad things going on in this country as well.” She wanted bring her children along today so they could start to understand the point of protest. “It’s quite difficult to explain to them what it’s about and I’m not sure they fully understand it yet,” she says. “But it’s the whole concept of having a voice and people coming together with a shared message.” Updated at 2.10pm GMT 1.52pm GMT More pussy hats proudly being worn by women (and men) on their way to the Washington DC march.

I would love to hear from you. 1.03pm GMT Here are some more quotes from marchers about why they’re out in force today. Nazila Kivi, feminist magazine editor, Copenhagen: I’m marching in solidarity with people gendered as women all around the world, especially indigenous, queer and migrant women, who are under a double burden of oppression. Women and our bodies very often become battle grounds for conservative and backwards ideas of nations, borders and racist ideologies. Solidarity and activism is all we have. Ritah Mutheu Muia, 37, entrepreneur, Nairobi: We march as the Her Voice society in Kenya because we stand in solidarity with our sisters from the US. We want to send a message that any act or policies that violate human rights or women’s rights will not be tolerated. In Kenya the fight against gender-based violence is far from over. As Kenyan women we have decided to break the silence. I’m handing the live blog over to my colleague Nicola Slawson now. She will continue to track all the latest developments.

Although organisers have said the march isn’t specifically anti-Donald Trump, it was timed to take place the day after he was inaugurated as president. Trump’s attitudes toward women dominated the campaign, particularly after a video revealed him saying he could “do anything” to women, including “grab them by the pussy”. At least 24 women came forward with allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior by Trump spanning more than 30 years. Trump has denied the allegations. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found the businessman and reality TV star had the lowest favourability rating of any incoming president since the 1970s. Women in the US gave a host of reasons for marching, ranging from inspiring other women to run for office to protesting Trump’s plans to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which among other things requires health insurers to cover birth control. Speakers in Washington will include Cecile Richards from reproductive health organisation Planned Parenthood, activists Angela Davis and Gloria Steinem, actresses Ashley Judd and Scarlett Johansson, filmmaker Michael Moore and the “Mothers of the Movement”, a group of mothers whose children died because of violence by the police or gun violence. Janelle Monáe, The Indigo Girls and Angelique Kidjo are among the musical acts scheduled to perform. Protests have been taking place across the US over the past day. In San Francisco, thousands formed a human chain on the Golden Gate Bridge and chanted “Love Trumps hate.” In the city’s financial district, a few hundred protesters blocked traffic outside an office building partly owned by Trump. In Atlanta, protests converged at City Hall and a few hundred people chanted and waved signs protesting Trump, denouncing racism and police brutality and expressing support for immigrants, Muslims and the Black Lives Matter movement. In Nashville, half a dozen protesters chained themselves to the doors of the Tennessee Capitol. Hundreds also sat in a 10-minute silent protest at a park while Trump took the oath of office. Organizers led a prayer, sang patriotic songs and read the Declaration of Independence aloud. In the Pacific Northwest, demonstrators in Portland, Oregon, burned US flags and students at Portland State University walked out of classes. About 200 protesters gathered on the Capitol steps in Olympia, Washington, carrying signs that included the messages “Resist Trump” and “Not My Problem.” 12.42pm GMT Yvette Cooper to give speech urging people to 'not let the clocks be turned back' Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP and chair of the home affairs select committee, will be speaking in Trafalgar Square, London, at around 2pm. Below is a copy of her speech: Today across the globe women and men are marching against hatred. Marching against division. Marching for equality. Marching because we will not be silenced and we will not go away. We are marching because the most powerful man in the country thinks it’s ok to grab women “by the pussy”. We are marching because a talented woman MP was murdered by a far right extremist and we need to call it out as the terrorism it is. We are marching because we believe what Jo Cox said that we have more in common than what divides us and because we won’t stay on the sidelines any more. And we are not just marching, we’re singing, we are shouting, we’re tweeting, snapchatting, facebooking - standing up to the misogynists, the bullies and the haters who try to intimidate and silence people online just as for years they tried to intimidate or silence women on the street, in the pub, in the workplace. Thirty years ago, many of us marched to reclaim the night. Women in Leeds were being told not to go out after dark, because it wasn’t safe, there were too many attacks. Instead they came together - in Leeds, London and across the country to reclaim the night, to take back the streets. Our new streets are online. Social media are our new pubs and clubs. So just as we stood together to reclaim the night we will stand together to reclaim the Internet too. But here’s the tough thing. We are here because we want to take a stand against Donald Trump. Millions of American women and men voted for him. Marching isn’t enough - we need to persuade, to win arguments, to challenge the deep causes of division and to build a future in common. We stand on the shoulders of our mothers and grandmothers - women who have gone before us and won great victories to get us equal pay, abortion rights, rape laws, child care paternity as well as maternity leave. But we won’t be judged on our victories but on how we deal with the setbacks. How we come together and rebuild when it feels like the clock is being turned back. For the sake of our children and grandchildren - our daughters and our sons - we are here because we will not let the clock be turned back now.

Khan said he was proud to march alongside women and men from London and around the world “to show how much we value the rights every woman should have”. He added: As a feminist in City Hall I fully support the fight for gender equality. It’s wrong that in 2017 someone’s life chances and fundamental rights are still dependent on their gender. In recent decades we’ve made good progress, but there is still so much more for us to do and we must redouble our efforts to make sure that as we strive for equality we do not lose all that we have achieved. As I march today I am more determined than ever to do everything I can to ensure that all girls growing up in London have the same opportunities in life as men.

Aisha Ali-Khan, 36, part-time teacher and carer, Shipley: I wanted to show solidarity with the rest of the women all over the world. Women are not being heard by those in power anywhere in the world – if they were we wouldn’t be marching today. I’m a Muslim, of Pakistani heritage – this is not just a white women’s march, it’s all women, all over the world. It’s a really inclusive movement and it’s amazing to be a part of that. Shoomi Chowdhury, Amnesty International, London We have so much left to do with regards to rights for ethnic minorities, particularly women from ethnic minorities, and not only is the potential for progress going to be lost, we’ve taken a massive step back.

Updated at 12.27pm GMT 12.05pm GMT Thousands of people are gathered outside the US embassy in London, hundreds of them wearing the pink pussy hats that have becoming a unifying symbol of this march. A huge variety of groups have gathered: those campaigning for migrant rights and women’s rights, as well as LGBTQ+ groups and anti-war protesters. But there are also many women – and a significant number of men – who have never been on a march before. Lizzy Billington, 62, had come from Cornwall to march with her daughter Alice, 22, and her 18-month-old grandson Isaac. “I haven’t been on a march since the 60s and I didn’t think I’d ever go on one again but I didn’t want to miss this,” she said. “In the 60s feminism wasn’t a dirty word and I feel this new movement is more like that. I find it very exciting.” The Women’s Equality party leader, Sophie Walker, said the march was “a powerful antidote to the message of fear and division we heard yesterday.” She added: “It is incredible to see such an huge commitment from all these people to do politics differently.” Frances Scott, of the 50:50 campaign which wants a more equal parliament in the UK, urged people to sign a petition run by the group. “I’m excited but I’m angry,” she said. “Trump was elected democratically, which shows that we really have to change the system. If we really believe in equality, that has to happen.” Already hundreds, if not thousands outside the American Embassy for #womensmarchonlondon pic.twitter.com/ERNQfz1c97 — Alexandra Topping (@LexyTopping) January 21, 2017 Updated at 12.55pm GMT 12.00pm GMT The Women’s March in London has begun, with more than 25,000 people expected to gather outside the US embassy in Grosvenor Square and march to Trafalgar Square. It takes place less than 24 hours after Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. Women and men from around the world have said they hope to send a unity message to Trump after a campaign in which he said Mexican immigrants were “rapists”, discussed banning Muslims from entering the US, and was revealed to have once bragged about grabbing women by the genitals and kissing them without permission. The chants are vast and varied.

Those values are propelling me. I’m marching because Trump ran a campaign of Islamophobia, antisemitism, misogyny, and racism: to stand up and say he does not speak for me. Natalino Soares Ornai Guterres, 27, consultant, Dili, East Timor: I have been displaced from my home and have travelled to other countries (including the US) in search of better opportunities. Being a member of the LGBT community, I am involved because I understand the struggle that our mothers, sisters and people with non-binary gender identities have to go through in a patriarchal society.

The march will begin at Grosvenor Square at 12 noon with speeches presented by the actor Rebecca Hall. Organisers say they aim to allow different voices to be heard. Speakers in Grosvenor Square will include the British playwright Rebecca Lenkiewicz and the Labour MP Stella Creasy. The march will then begin at 12.30pm and will finish at Trafalgar Square at 2pm with a rally hosted by Sandi Toksvig, involving speeches from celebrities and leaders of supporting organisations.

I’ll post a few of these throughout the day. Maria Kostaki, 43, author, Athens: While not a citizen of the US, I am organising this march in Athens because I believe the issues it represents are global. It’s about humanity. It’s about women’s rights, racism, equality, LGBT rights. I have a four-year-old son and I do not want him to grow up in a world where everything we have fought for is taken away. We can’t allow anyone to reverse what we have built. Lotje Horvers, 34, tour manager, Amsterdam I want to be part of the message to the world that there are more people who love than people who hate, and I will not stand by silently while a lying bully is given one of the most responsible positions in the world. I cannot be at peace with the fact he uses his voice to set an example that it is acceptable to be demeaning to women and minorities. Updated at 11.02am GMT 10.54am GMT Of course, not everyone supports today’s movement, for varying reasons.

It’s time to speak your mind and concerns and to do our best to salvage the values we cherish in America,” said Bill Scholer, an art teacher. In Manila on Friday, about 200 demonstrators from a Philippine nationalist group rallied for about an hour against Trump outside the US embassy. Some held up signs demanding US troops leave the Philippines, and others set fire to a paper US flag bearing a picture of Trump’s face. Updated at 10.49am GMT 10.15am GMT Protesters in Australia and New Zealand were the first to start marching today. In Sydney, Australia’s biggest city, about 3,000 people gathered for a rally in Hyde Park before marching on the US consulate downtown. A further 5,000 people rallied in Melbourne. In New Zealand there were marches in four cities, involving around 2,000 people. “Feminism is my Trump card” and “Fight like a girl,” were among the placards seen in Sydney. Organiser Mindy Freiband told Reuters: We’re not marching as an anti-Trump movement per se, we’re marching to protest the hate speech, the hateful rhetoric, the misogyny, the bigotry, the xenophobia and we want to present a united voice with women around the globe. Many of the protesters in Sydney and Melbourne wore pink hats, which activists referred to as their “pussyhats”. Many said they were worried that Trump’s politics and his attitude towards women and minorities could spread. “As a mature 56-year-old lesbian, I feel for the first time what is global is local,” said Vicki Skehan. “We’ve come so far with inclusiveness and I don’t want to see that go away.” Updated at 10.50am GMT 10.00am GMT Yesterday in Washington more than 200 protesters were arrested as police used pepper spray and stun grenades to suppress a series of small, violent confrontations before and after Trump was sworn in as president. Thousands of protesters from numerous groups descended on DC for mostly peaceful demonstrations throughout the day, but shortly after Trump was sworn in, violent protests broke out in the downtown area close to the north lawn of the White House and blocks from the path of the inaugural parade. A few dozen protesters clad in black threw projectiles at police and barricaded the road with newspaper kiosks and bins, which they later set fire to. The group were quickly surrounded by police in riot gear who used sting-ball grenades and pepper spray, police said, after a black limousine was set on fire.

A previous demonstration was the Women’s Suffrage Parade of 1913, in which, one day before President Woodrow Wilson’s inauguration, an estimated 5,000 to 8,000 suffragists marched on Pennsylvania Avenue. The parade is considered to be a major milestone for the movement to win women the right to vote, not least because it drew attention to the movement as the thousands of people who were in Washington for the inauguration witnessed the procession. The 1913 march is set to be depicted on the back of the redesigned $10 bill in 2020. Another inauguration that drew strong reaction from the world was that of Richard Nixon in 1968, as the United States fought an unpopular war in Vietnam. Updated at 10.53am GMT 9.21am GMT Organisers Women’s March Global, the international arm of the Washington march, have said Donald Trump’s election has ignited a powder keg under the global women’s rights movement that will have far-reaching ramifications. As many as 500,000 people are expected to descend on DC, joined by as many as 1.5 million more marching in support in 161 cities across all seven continents. The organisers are determined to capitalise on the wave of activism that has attracted hundreds of thousands of first-time campaigners as well as seasoned activists. “The women of the world were sitting on a powder keg and Donald Trump just lit the match,” Evvie Harmon, a Women’s March co-founder and global coordinator, told the Guardian. Set up after Trump’s election victory, the global movement is being hailed as an unprecedented grassroots movement, and organisers say it will have an immediate and concrete impact. Many international coordinators say they are marching in solidarity with US women, but that human rights and not Donald Trump are the focus. Cells set up throughout the US and hundreds of other places are plotting local campaigns, from preventing the construction of oil pipelines to outlawing female genital mutilation. They will adhere to the “guiding vision” of the Women’s March on issues such as the rights of immigrant, disabled and LGBTQIA women and female workers. Individual groups will decide which targeted actions to take. Marches are due to take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Erbil, Iraq where an organiser from Alliance for Peace and Human Rights (APHRO) said holding the march was a challenge because of tribalism, corruption and the difficulty of getting approval from the government “who deny that women have challenges in this Iraqi society,” such as lack of salaries, terror, hate, exploitation and trafficking. Harmon added: I don’t know any grassroots organisation that has grown to this size in only two months. There are now about 1,000 coordinators around the world. It’s too big and it’s growing too fast to control. And we wouldn’t want to. We just want to support and help it to flourish. Updated at 10.55am GMT 9.00am GMT In the UK at least 14 marches, demonstrations and gatherings are planned. In London, tens of thousands of people are planning to turn out in solidarity, and sister demonstrations are also being held in Bangor, Barnstaple, Belfast, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Lancaster, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Shipley, Southampton, St Austell and York. The London march starts at midday at the US embassy: 24 Grosvenor Square, W1A 2LQ. Marchers plan to assemble in front of the embassy before making their way to Trafalgar Square for a 90-minute rally from 2pm. People who would rather take a shorter route can join the march where Pall Mall meets Waterloo Place. Everything you need to know about the UK marches can be found in our report below. Related: Women's marches across the UK: what you need to know Updated at 10.56am GMT 8.53am GMT The Women’s March on Washington starts at 10am EST, near the south-east corner of the National Mall. But before and after then, many women’s marches are taking place across the US and around the world. There are marches planned in every state in the US, as well as many countries in Europe, Central and South America, Africa, Asia and various cities across Canada and Australia. Those marching outside the US are doing so in solidarity with American women and standing up for the rights of women in their own countries.

Although the organisers say the march isn’t specifically anti-Donald Trump, it was timed to take place the day after the businessman and former reality TV star was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States, to the dismay of many who had been appalled by his record on the election trail. Trump’s attitudes toward women dominated the campaign, particularly after a video revealed him saying he could “do anything” to women, including “grab them by the pussy”. At least 24 women came forward with allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior by Trump spanning more than 30 years. Trump has denied the allegations. Today women – and men – are taking to the streets to “send a bold message to our new government on their first day in office, and to the world that women’s rights are human rights”, according to the march’s official mission. The event kicks off at 10am ET with a rally on the corner of 3rd St and Independence Ave. Speakers will include Cecile Richards from reproductive health organisation Planned Parenthood, activists Angela Davis and Gloria Steinem, actresses Ashley Judd and Scarlett Johansson, filmmaker Michael Moore and the “Mothers of the Movement”, a group of mothers whose children died because of violence by the police or gun violence. Janelle Monáe, The Indigo Girls and Angelique Kidjo are among the musical acts scheduled to perform. At 1.15pm the march will begin down Independence Ave to 14th St SW, then it will head to the Ellipse and the Washington Monument, where the event will finish at 4pm. Other celebrity guests include singers Cher, Katy Perry and Zendaya, model Chrissy Teigen, comedians Amy Schumer and Cristela Alonzo, TV host Padma Lakshmi, artist Kara Walker, and actresses Hari Nef, Amandla Stenberg, Frances McDormand, Uzo Aduba, America Ferrera and Julianne Moore. Women from all over the country are pouring into DC, with trains, planes and buses full of marchers arriving on Friday and early Saturday morning.

A regularly updated map on the march website allows people to search by zipcode for their nearest event. More than 20 countries will also host solidarity marches, with nations including Australia, Canada, Portugal and Mexico and the UK holding events. Guardian reporters including Molly Redden, Lauren Gambino, Sabrina Siddiqui and Laurence Mathieu-Léger will at the DC march to provide live updates. We’ll provide interviews, news and photos from the march all day. Stay tuned.

We did one of those \"if it's Tuesday it must be Rome\" holidays, visiting too many cities in too short a time, travelling by train, feasting on cheese and salami and cheap red wine, and staying in cheap but far from cheerful two-star hotels. We loved it all the same. I remember catching the vaporetto down Venice's Grand Canal, gazing up at the obviously more affluent tourists sipping prosecco in glasses (not plastic cups) on palazzo terraces (not windowsills), and I think I actually sighed. I know I thought: \"We're going to holiday like that one day.\" Smitten with Italy – particularly with its fantastic food – we returned, each time staying longer. We hired a car and drove around, spending longer – several days, sometimes a week – in each place. But still we stayed in hotels, albeit nicer ones. We were a little older, but not yet wiser – because in Italy extra euros might get you a better bathroom and glassware, but it doesn't always buy extra space. We didn't yet realise we could be renting an apartment for a fraction of the price. We began to seek out more interesting, idiosyncratic and intimate hotels. And that's when we started to think about how we really like to travel. In Italy, small boutique hotels are often on back streets, tucked into forgotten corners of quaint, quiet neighbourhoods. It's amazing what a difference location makes: being in those out-of-the-way spots gave us a taste for everyday life beyond postcard images of washing on balconies and old people gossiping on park benches. Looking out of a window in Venice Photograph: Terence Carter The next year, we took things a step further, booking a studio in a centuries-old palazzo in Venice that I found on an estate agent's website. Located at the end of a skinny alleyway, slap-bang between Cannaregio and Castello, two of Venice's least touristy sestieri (districts), it really felt like a secret. We had to convert our sofa into a bed each night, the bathroom was bigger than the kitchen, and we didn't have that terrace I coveted. In fact, our two tiny balconies weren't much bigger than the two-star windowsills where we'd sipped vino years earlier. But there were frescoes on the walls, antique candelabra, and the Rialto market with its fresh produce was a stroll away. Each afternoon gondolas would glide down our picturesque little canal with camera-snapping tourists who had no hesitation including us in their pictures. Did they envy us sitting up there with our tumblers of table wine from a hole-in-the-wall shop around the corner where staff filled our empty one-litre water bottles from a wooden barrel for two euros? We didn't care. We got more of a thrill out of saying buongiorno to the guys who manoeuvred their small barges down the same canal to collect our rubbish twice a week. Ironically, it was participating in the routines and rituals of everyday life – taking the rubbish out, shopping in the markets and cooking, the very things we usually go on holiday to avoid – that gave us the biggest kick. They afforded us an insight into local life that you don't get as tourists. We were hooked. Naviglio canal, Milan Photograph: Terence Carter We spent a summer in Milan in an flat overlooking the Naviglio Grande canal – an arty neighbourhood quiet until after dark, when intrepid foodies descended on the local aperitivo bars and trattorias. That was fine, because we were the ones living there, participating in the locals' early evening sipping and snacking ritual every single day. As in Venice, we took our cues from the little old ladies pulling their vinyl shopping trollies when it came to deciding which specialist vendors to frequent and what produce to buy. And it delighted us no end that our favourite cheese-seller took pride in teaching us how to order in Italian, little by little, each day. Another year we stayed in a trullo, a whitewashed, conical house among olive groves just outside Alberobello in Puglia. Our caretaker, Maria, would turn up unannounced to hang a bunch of semi-dried tomatoes from the ceiling of our charming little kitchen or show us how to stoke the wood-fired oven attached to the home. One day she brought a wooden board, a rolling pin and a colossal bag of flour and taught us how to make fresh pasta and pizza. We insisted she call her family to come over and we all feasted together by candlelight next to the pizza oven. But it was our last summer in Venice that was the most memorable. We finally graduated to a sprawling palazzo overlooking the Grand Canal – even if the mezzanine-level bedroom looked like it had been added in the 1970s, the crockery was of the same era, and the wallpaper was peeling. We stocked the fridge with prosecco, Aperol and Campari, and established our own ritual. Each evening we stood at our window – no, we still didn't have a terrace – and sipped our homemade spritz while watching the vaporetto cruise by. And we sighed. • Travel writer Lara Dunston and her photographer husband Terence Carter have authored 60 guidebooks and countless stories.

In practical terms it means that the price for a dish or drink on the menu includes tax and tips and there are no hidden surprises. However, most serving staff are on fixed contracts and salaries, so this goes to the owner. Most French people will leave an additional tip of around €2 if the service has been moderately good, more – around 15% – if it is exceptional. These tips should be left in cash on the table. They may be added to a pot for all the serving staff or pocketed by individual waiters. Bars As in restaurants, the service is included in the price in cafes and bars. If you are at a table, or on a terrace, the prices will be slightly higher than at the bar (where the service is minimal) and the waiter will not expect, but will hope for, a small tip – usually a few coins – when he brings the change. In most bars customers are not expected to pay upfront – you order, you consume, you get a bill, you pay – but if you do pay upfront you are expected to stay at the bar and not go and sit down. Taxis Again there is no obligation, but taxi drivers do expect you to at least round up to the next euro and, if they have helped you catch that train, add another euro or two. Hotels This depends on the establishment. A good idea is around €1 per large bag. With the chambermaid it’s traditional to leave €1 a night (€1.50 if you’re feeling generous), but many people don’t. The person delivering room service will hope for a couple of euros. Good to know Waiters get a salary, which is usually just above the minimum wage. They rely on tips, and the cash supplements their often meagre fixed income. The word for “tip” in France is “pourboire” – literally “in order to drink”. If you have a pizza or a parcel delivered, the person doing so will be very happy with €1. Another form of tip for more long-term visitors to France are “étrennes”, the French equivalent of the Christmas box, which the concierge, firefighter, post delivery person and refuse collectors will ask for and expect. A TripAdvisor survey in August 2014 found that 15% of French customers never tip, up from 7% the previous year. More than a third said they leave less than in previous years. Kim Willsher, Paris Spain Restaurants Service charges are rarely included in the bill. Debit and credit cards are widely accepted, but it’s good to keep a few euros change on hand if you’re paying by card, as it’s unlikely that you’ll be able to add a tip through the machine. The economic crisis has introduced a degree of precariousness into the industry, meaning tipping is always appreciated In lower-end restaurants tipping is not expected, but you can round up the bill to the nearest euro. In middle- to high-end restaurants you can leave a few euros, up to a maximum of 5%, if you were happy with the service. If a staff member goes out of their way to translate a menu, or ensure your preferences are taken into account, it’s worth tipping an extra euro or two. At Michelin-starred restaurants tipping can go as high as 10% to reflect what should be a higher level of service. Bars Bartenders don’t expect any kind of tip. If you’re getting table service, it’s worth rounding up the bill to the nearest euro. Taxis No tip is expected, but rounding up to the nearest euro will suffice. Hotels Tips aren’t expected, but if you’re in a high-end hotel and a porter helps you with your bag, they should be tipped about a euro per bag. A euro or two for the room cleaner is not expected, but always welcome. Good to know People working in Spain’s hospitality industry are generally full-time employees who are paid a salary. However, the economic crisis has introduced a degree of precariousness into the industry, meaning tipping is always appreciated. Ashifa Kassam, Madrid Italy Restaurants A tip should be left in cash, not on a credit card, and it is not expected but is seen as generous. Most Italians would leave a few euros on the table, but not more than 10% of the total. Before you leave a tip make sure there is no service charge on the bill, which does happen in some cases and is listed as “coperto”, like a cover charge. Bars Italians do not generally tip at bars, although service is available at some bars and pubs. There are plenty of coffee bars. Ones that cater to tourists might charge far more if you decide to take a seat, when they will bring the coffee to you after you order it, instead of standing at the bar. Taxis Most Italians would round up the taxi charge, and it would be seen as generous for a long ride. But generally no tip is expected. Hotels A bag carrier would expect a few euros if they carry your bags to their room. The same can be said for cleaning staff in your hotel room. Stephanie Kirchgaessner, Rome United States Restaurants A tip of about 20% is generally expected as standard, with more suggested for particularly good service. Some locals tend, instead, to simply double the price stated on the bill for local sales tax, which works out at about 18% of the total. In America waitresses depend on tips for much of their pay, while in Sweden tipping a waiter can be seen as demeaning. Photograph: Getty Waiters and waitresses depend on tips for much of their pay. As such it is generally assumed that all tips go direct to the server. Cash makes this simpler, but American restaurants also make it easier to tip by card. You may add a tip when signing the receipt after your card has been swiped. Bars Bartenders expect a dollar per drink if they serve you at the bar. For table service something more like 20% of the bill is expected. Taxis Taxi drivers are not well paid and do expect tips. Again, 20% is generally seen as standard – as reflected by this being the smallest suggested tip listed on screen when paying by card. Hotels About $1-$2 per bag is expected among hotel staff, while roughly $5 per night spent is often left for the housekeeping staff. Good to know Generally it’s worth keeping in mind that in America workers in “tipped” jobs, such as waiters and bar staff, have a significantly lower minimum wage than others – not usually more than $2 an hour. So a standard tip is viewed by their bosses as simply part of their wage rather than a bonus for especially good service. Jon Swaine, New York Ireland Restaurants Very much like the UK: 10% generally, more if service is exceptionally good. Again like the UK, sometimes service is included in the bill (especially for large parties) and sometimes not. Don’t feel obliged to make a further payment if they have already added it on. One neat saving, though, is free tap water – nearly all restaurants, except the very fanciest, put it on tables as standard. Bars Tipping for bar service is rare. However, many pubs allow you to order from your seat and the drinks are brought to you (Guinness can take a long time to pour). If so, the standard tip is €1-€2 (for the round, not each individual drink). Taxis A bit of a mish-mash. It is not automatically expected, and most people do little more than round up the fare. If you do want to, 10% should be enough. Hotels A euro or two for taking bags to your room. Most hotel guests simply leave small change for the housekeeping staff. Good to know Irish workers, including waiters and waitresses, used to enjoy some of the highest minimum wage levels in the world, but there has been no increase since 2007 when it was set at €8.65 an hour. That now works out at just £6.07 an hour, significantly below the UK rate of £6.70, so they welcome tips. Patrick Collinson, Dublin Germany Restaurants Service (“bedienung” in German) and VAT are always included in your restaurant bill and waiters don’t live on tips, but it is customary to leave a gratuity unless the service was poor. As knigge.de, the German etiquette bible puts it: “Man sollte, muss aber nicht” (“You should tip, although you are not obliged to”). It is far more common to pay individually in Germany, which means you add your own tip to your bill You pay the waiter or waitress who served you – and who usually carries a big money pouch – at the table. As a rule you give a 5%-10% tip (or “trinkgeld”, which translates as “drinking money”). As bills are usually settled in cash, you simply round up – for example, if your meal costs €23 you round up to €25 (tell the waiter “25” when you hand over the cash). For bigger bills, round up to the nearest five or zero (eg, €50 if the bill is €46). If you have the exact amount you give it to the waiter and tell them “stimmt so” (“We are even”) so they know they can keep the change. Bars Again, for smaller bills, round up to the next euro or add another euro; for bigger bills, a bit more. If you are sitting at the bar you always run a tab and pay at the end (rather than by glass), so that’s when you include a gratuity if you want to. Taxis You don’t have to tip drivers, but you are expected to round up to the next euro or 50 cents. Give an extra euro or two if they have been helpful. Hotels In more upmarket hotels it is customary to tip €2 per bag, and €2-€5 for room service. Good to know You don’t leave change on the table – you give a tip to the waiter by rounding up your bill. The waiter usually asks whether you want to pay separately or together (“getrennt oder alles zusammen?”) – it is far more common to pay individually than in the UK, which means you add your own tip to your bill. Many restaurants do not accept credit cards so check before you order. Julia Kollewe, Bonn/London Austria Restaurants In less touristy areas service is often not included, and it is expected that customers either round up or add around 10% to their bill. This usually goes direct to the waiter/waitress who has their own change purse or, in some cases, it goes into a shared pot. It is always advisable to carry cash as quite a few places (again outside the tourist areas) still don’t accept cards, or only do so reluctantly. Bars Bartenders often expect a tip. If they serve at the table, which is usually the case, then they would expect at least a “rounded up tip”. Often they expect a similar tip even if they’ve served you at the bar. On principle, I don’t tip in these situations because I think it’s ridiculous – but I’ve found that approach does not make you any friends! Taxis It is common to leave a taxi driver a tip, especially if it’s easy to round up. If not, around 10% is fine, although I don’t think drivers would get upset if they don’t receive one. Hotels Tips are not expected, but a couple of euros would suffice if you want. Good to know It can be a bit confusing. It is usual for customers to pay individually for their drinks and food. Each person is expected to give their own tip to the waiter, but they should not leave it on the table. Instead, when the waiter says the amount the customer should specify how much they will pay, including the tip. So if it is €23, the customer might hand €30 and say “25”. This often catches tourists out. If you don’t do it that way the waiter might stand at the table pointedly rummaging around in their wallet for several minutes “looking” for your change. Easier to just hand over a rounded up amount and say “danke”, which implies you don’t want any change. To really impress, customers could also say “stimmt so” – another way of saying “keep the change”. Maddy French, Vienna Sweden Restaurants Service is almost always included, and you can safely assume it is unless expressly told otherwise. That shouldn’t stop you paying a tip if the service is particularly good, or if you really hit it off with the waiter, for example. The money goes to the waiting staff and is usually shared equally at the end of the evening. 10% is generous. In high-end hotels it is usual to tip a porter … but in Sweden staff would just look bewildered if you offered them cash. Photograph: Michael Blann/Getty Bars Often bar staff come to your table and expect you to order there, not at the bar, or if you get to the bar then they will bring you your drinks. But there is certainly no need to tip them for this. If staff prompt you to tip, something is amiss – or perhaps you are in a swanky city bar where moneyed young Swedes are keen to flaunt their cash. Taxis Taxi drivers do not expect to be tipped. Rides are metered – and not cheap – so you just pay what it says on the dashboard. Card payment is universally accepted. If paying cash, it is a courtesy to round up the amount. Hotels Hotel staff are likely to look bewildered if you offer them a tip for carrying your bags. They do not expect to have to tug their forelocks to earn their crust, and there is usually a clear career structure in hotels, which is how staff aspire to get on after they notch up the requisite training and qualifications. Good to know Service has not generally been itemised on restaurant bills since 1993, after unions representing restaurant staff signed an agreement with employers to regulate salaries across the industry. So your waiter is not on a minimum wage (Sweden does not even have one), has probably undergone formal and sometimes prolonged training at a specialist vocational college, has a sense of pride in his or her work, and faith in the future. Therefore they do not want a tip, let alone expect it – with the implication that their living is dependent on your caprice, rather than on the right to receive a living wage. It’s not quite Barcelona in 1936, but rather a legacy of the country’s idealistic, egalitarian past and its surviving consensus approach to industrial relations. David Crouch, Gothenburg Brazil Restaurants A 10% service charge is included. Extra tips are not expected but definitely appreciated, and mostly done only if the service is excellent. If you want to tip extra, do so in cash so it goes straight to the waiter. The tips are usually pooled and sometimes also divided with the kitchen and cleaning staff as well. Legally, it is not mandatory to pay the service charge but it is very rare to request that it be deducted – even when the service is bad. Most waiters earn a minimum wage (R$907,20 which is around £183 a month in Rio) plus tips. Bars Same as above as most bars function like restaurants and also serve food. In closed bars with music, bartenders often won’t handle money at all and tipping is rare. Taxis Tips are uncommon. It’s normal to round the value in order to avoid dealing with coins. Don’t expect exact change. If the taxi is R$13.75, paying R$14 is the norm but R$15 is still acceptable. If 5-10 cents above, round down. Hotels A tip of R$5 or R$10 (£1-£2) is normal for the cleaner and for the person who carries your bag to your room, if the service is good. Shanna Hanbury, Rio de Janeiro A tourist’s guide to Britain We are horribly mean … but still expect a chocolate on our pillow Restaurants It’s pot luck if the restaurant includes a service charge on the bill. Always check, and don’t be tempted to leave a penny extra if the charge has already been added. If not, most people feel 10% is OK, but there is a trend towards 12.5%. Please resist. Splitting a bill is difficult enough without having to work out what 12.5% is. Best to leave cash if possible – tips on cards probably just go to the boss. Bars We never tip. You will occasionally see your change put on a tray, the idea being that you leave it there. Ignore this and pocket the money immediately unless you really fancy the bartender. In some “hip” bars the loo attendant will try to spray you with eau de toilette and expect £1 in return. Not a single customer of the bar likes this, but they inexplicably persist with offering this “service”. Do what the Brits do – walk out awkwardly, mumbling that you have no money on you. Hotels Grip your luggage to avoid a flunkey carrying it a few yards and wanting payment. If you are caught, £1 per bag is enough.

I had checked the forecast and, as I left the warm valley behind, was ready to catch the last skiing of the season when I reached Gran Sasso, the highest peak in central Italy's Apennine range. What I wasn't ready for was the unusual history of the ski lodge that awaited me. The Hotel Campo Imperatore ski lodge, an art deco jewel at 7,000ft, is still surrounded by snow drifts in early May. While most mountain refuges pack hikers and skiers in like sardines, it has room for a grand piano in the panoramic dining room. And among its bedrooms is the room once occupied by fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. It has been preserved unchanged since he was held prisoner there for 12 days in 1943 – right down to the same elegant wooden furniture, the same bed and even the same, now pretty soggy, mattress. The sheets are new, but the originals are folded in the cupboard if you take your history that seriously. The story of Italy's oddest tourist attraction starts in 1934, when the lodge was built, complete with elegant mosaics, a glass-roofed reading room and cocktail bar, as a hangout for aristocrats, cardinals and Mussolini's officials, perched so high it was only reachable by cable car in winter. In September 1943, the good times came to an end when it was used as a makeshift prison for Mussolini, who had just been ousted by the king of Italy as the allies started their march up the peninsula. But two weeks later, Hitler ordered the SS to mount a daring raid using gliders to land outside the hotel and spirit Mussolini away – his 80 guards stood aside and failed to fire a shot – before installing him as a puppet dictator in the Republic of Salo. Seeing red: Benito's bedroom, preserved unchanged since he was imprisoned there. Photograph: PR Seven decades on, as manager Paolo Pecilli sets out plates of local ricotta cheese and chunks of pizza for a pre-dinner aperitivo, he said he does get neofascists coming through, although he isn't one: \"I keep the room and the hotel unchanged to respect the history, not to honour it.\" Pecilli has his work cut out. With funds short and no preservation order, the lodge is slowly crumbling and some of the huge windows in the dining room have been cracked by winter storms. Yet the sense of grandeur is palpable. After dinner, as the wind howled outside, I leaned on the piano to admire the murals of 1930s diners and felt like Jack Nicholson surrounded by ghosts in The Shining. Even as the spring sun melted the snow at nearby resorts such as Campo Felice, Pecilli told me the skiing was still good here until early May, or you can trek on snow shoes to the nearby Duca degli Abruzzi lodge along a path that becomes a gorgeous, grassy walk by June. By then, strong hikers can make it to the Corno Grande peak in three hours from the lodge to be stunned by the 360-degree view taking in the Adriatic Sea to the east and the Tyrrhenian Sea to the west. Slightly stiff after a night in Benito's bed, I hopped back into the cable car, emerging in the warm, sunny valley below to find Romans loading skis back in their cars for the 90-minute drive back to town, and nonchalantly talking of heading to the beach the next day. But I didn't want to go home to Rome. I was stuck on the idea of finding a bit of the Gran Sasso national park to hike in, free from snow, and since I didn't want to wait for June, my next stop was the village of Calascio, a pristine collection of handsome stone houses clinging to a mountain side at 4,000 feet. Calascio survived the 2009 earthquake that devastated L'Aquila, thanks to its solid palazzi – the area's wealth derived from wool and the herds of sheep that have populated Abruzzo since the Roman era. I arrived on a Sunday morning to find the almond trees in blossom, church bells ringing and cyclists stopping to suck in the cool mountain air, watched from the café by the mayor in his Sunday best, who was knocking back an espresso before mass. 'Mountains as far as the eye could see': Campo Imperatore at sunset. Photograph: Massimo Merlini/Getty Images/Vetta Photograph: Massimo Merlini/Getty Images/Vetta My plan was to climb up and check the view from the 1,000-year-old fortified tower on the peak above Calascio, built to defend the shepherds. Scaling a steep path past crocuses, daffodils and the first, hesitant lizard of the season, a collection of crumbled outhouses and a proud tower came into view, with what appeared to be most of the world spread out at its feet. To the south sat the snow-capped Monte Sirente, while to the east I looked down across empty mountains and deep valleys that marched off as far as the eye could see, punctuated by fairytale villages and sliced into shifting shades of green. Getting hungry, I drove on to the nearest of those villages, Castel del Monte – where George Clooney set his moody 2010 film The American – and ate a huge portion of excellent homemade pasta with lentils followed by salty mutton kebabs, or arrosticini, for a derisory sum at La Loggia, a restaurant hidden in an old house in the village. Afterwards, I walked off my lunch in the grassy wilderness of the national park, curling round contours to reach Santo Stefano di Sessanio, another ridiculously photogenic stone village. I know I'll be back. In August, when the heat is unbearable in the capital, Romans flee to Gran Sasso and hike up to the Calderone – Europe's southernmost glacier. I plan to join them – and eat sausage and polenta in the cold air, as if it were January. Essentials The Fonte Ceretto cable-car station is a 90-minute drive from Rome.

O’Hare’s The Man Behind the Curtain, atop a flash Leeds clothing emporium is equally idiosyncratic, a graffiti’d gallery space masquerading as one-star Michelin dining destination: the superannuated tyre-pushers were unusually on the ball, recognising it as something special in its first year. But this is not so much refined posh tea as full-on sensory assault, with ingredient combos and presentation that may give even Ferran Adrià pause for thought (smoked mackerel parfait in a coffee-dusted bonbon served in a cup of coffee beans, anyone?). Yet it works – mostly – not least because O’Hare’s cooking is informed by an outrageously infectious wit. In 2015, he even took a step towards celeb chef status with a winning turn on the BBC’s Great British Menu with a dish of pork, salt-baked purple potatoes, frozen flowers and anchovies. He called it My Mother is Single and Looking for a Well-Dressed Man. BG Top Floor, Flannels, 68-78 Vicar Lane, Leeds LS1 7JH 2: The new food TV The new food TV is happening outside traditional broadcasting slots and mostly online. Netflix is home to documentaries such as Chef’s Table – recently recommissioned for three more series – which focuses on star chefs such as Massimo Bottura, and Michael Pollan’s Cooked, based on the US food writer’s book of the same name. C4.com recently released My Pop Up Restaurant, a six-part series in which presenters (and supper-club hosts) Laura Jackson and Alice Levine visit home cooks from across the UK as they try and hold their own supper club. As Jackson and Levine point out: “You have a lot more freedom – online we can have more personality and say things that we definitely couldn’t say on TV.” SM 3: Mezcal Mexico’s second-most famous spirit is to tequila what armagnac is to cognac. The basic ingredient, the agave succulent, is the same (although mezcal can be made from a range of different agave varieties and tequila just one). Whereas tequila, with a handful of exceptions, is produced by bigger brands, mezcal is still mostly made by smaller producers in the southern state of Oaxaca. That makes for wider stylistic variations on a theme of smoky earthiness: in mezcal production the agave hearts are cooked in barbecue-like pits. It also fits in with bartenders’ appetite for artisanal products. Still not easy to find in supermarkets, mezcals from the likes of Quiquiriqui, Del Maguey and Siete Misterios are best sipped rather than shot in specialist Brahms & Liszt in Hackney or new-wave Mexican restaurants such as Dalston’s Mezcal Cantina or Soho’s La Bodega Negra. DW 4: The accountants for new restaurateurs “We hold up a mirror to our clients,” says Hussein Ahmad of Viewpoint Partners. “We show them what they are doing in cold, hard numbers.” The firm was started by David Grant after he responded to a Gumtree ad for an accountant from Brunswick House restaurant in south London. It now does the books for a whole range of London’s hottest openings, including Portland, Frank’s Café and Primeur. “It’s an organic thing,” Ahmad adds. “When a general manager or chef from one of our clients wants to set up on their own, they might know how to cook or buy wine, but not how to raise money. A lot of people are focused on the concept without understanding the costs. They can think they’re doing well, and get good reviews, but don’t realise they are losing money until six months down the line.” EC 5: The Sethi siblings Most people would be satisfied with running one of the UK’s rare Michelin-starred Indian restaurants, Trishna in London – after all, you can count those on one hand. But the Sethi siblings – chef Karam, ex-Goldman Sachs financial whiz Jyotin and sommelier sister Sunaina – repeated the trick with Gymkhana, which in 2014 was voted the UK’s best restaurant by industry experts, an unheard-of accolade for a curry house., no matter how fancy. The trio’s Midas touch doesn’t apply only to high-end subcontinental tucker, either: their JKS restaurant group also backs the lauded likes of James Lowe’s Lyle’s, Sandia Chang and James Knappett’s Bubbledogs/Kitchen Table double act, and a bricks-and-mortar venture by Taiwanese street-food favourites Bao. At the end of last year, the Sethis came up with Hoppers in Soho, which instantly had queues round the block for its Sri Lankan-inspired street snacks. A second Bao site is on the way, while rumours persist the Sethis have a further Indian-themed plan up their sleeves. If past form is anything to go by, the OFM 50 may be saluting whatever that turns out to be this time next year. BG jksrestaurants.com 6: Coffee and tonic However bizarre this may sound, trust me, it’s good. I tried it last summer at Koppi, a coffee shop and roastery in Helsingborg, Sweden, and I’ve been raving about it ever since. After a Koppi employee stumbled on it a few years ago, it’s become the shop’s bestselling cold brew – but you don’t have to go to Sweden to try it. Simply fill a tall glass with ice, add tonic (Koppi uses Fevertree) and top it off with a shot of espresso (the size of the shot is up to you). The trick, according to Koppi’s Anne Lunell, is to use lots of ice to offset the heat of the espresso. Good coffee helps, too: Koppi ship for free when you order four or more bags of its exceptional beans. KF 7: Amandine Chaignot Chef Amandine Chaignot. Photograph: Pål Hansen for Observer Food Monthly “My family was very science-focused, and it never occurred to me to work in hospitality,” says Amandine Chaignot, who studied pharmacy before retraining as a chef. “I put on my whites for the first time on the day France won the World Cup: 12 July 1998.” Since then, she has worked with Alain Ducasse and Christopher Hache, and at the Ritz in London and Le Meurice in Paris. Now she has been appointed executive chef at the Rosewood, in Holborn. Her menu for the hotel’s glitzy Mirror Room is highly seasonal with a deft touch. “Male chefs can be quite competitive about who has the richest sauces,” she says. “I have another way of cooking. Hopefully it’s refined but it’s also relaxed, and even though the food can be quite complex, I think it is easy to understand.” EC Mirror Room, Rosewood London, High Holborn, London WC1V 7EN 8: Alain Passard He is the still-curly-haired and choirboy-faced godfather of the vegetable: the triple-Michelin-star chef who figure-headed the movement to taking garnish centre stage. Alain Passard still cooks most days at L’Arpège, 30 years after taking over from mentor Alain Senderens; 20 after gaining his third star, and now approaching his own 60th birthday on 4 August. “I have had two lives,” he says. “Fifteen years mostly cooking with meat and 15 years with vegetables.” Cited by Momofuku’s David Chang as “the most important chef ever” and by David Kinch of California’s Manresa as “the only chef I’ve ever met that I can unequivocally call a true artist”, Passard has schooled Pascal Barbot of L’Astrance, Bertrand Grébaut of Septime, and – for a few weeks before he was fired – Magnus Nilsson of Fäviken. Vegetable dishes had shone before but Passard has made eating his menu an almost spiritual experience (he is also evangelical about farming, producing 40 tonnes of organic food a year from three potagers where ploughs are drawn by donkey). The switch came during the mad cow crisis, he says. He felt he had accomplished all he could with his menu, he was ”ready to cook with colours”. Ask about his favourite vegetables and he enters a sort of rapture: “In the spring,” he says, “perhaps peas are my favourite … for me, it’s green caviar. In autumn and winter, celeriac is my crystal ball.” (He tends to cook and talk in rhapsody.) “It’s fabulous to teach my team how to cook this way,” he says, “how to smell and what seasons mean. My favourite dish, for example, is a vegetable harlequin. At first it involved 12 elements. Today, there are only three. I try to be more precise.” Be warned, stellar three-star precision does not come cheap: the dejeuner des jardiniers menu is €140, the terre et mer, €370. On value for money, I ask Magnus Nilsson: “On my last day in France, after leaving L’Astrance [where he worked with Barbot],” he says, “I had the unexpected pleasure of receiving my holiday pay. I packed my belongings in three suitcases, lugged them to L’Arpège (I lived close by) and gave them the money – about €1,400 – in an envelope and asked them to make me lunch. It was one of those defining meals, not just because the food was fantastic and I had great old burgundy but because of all the circumstances around it. When the meal was over, I asked them to order me a taxi and went straight to the airport to leave for Sweden.” AJ 9: The Quality Chop House’s mince on toast The Quality Chop House’s confit potatoes are among the UK’s most Instagrammed dishes (and rightly so: they’re almost as good to look at as to eat , but I can’t fathom why another ever-present on Shaun Searley’s otherwise regularly changing menu doesn’t come in for similar levels of adoration. Sure, the Chop’s take on humble mince on toast may not have quite the come-hither allure as the spuds, but this is like no mince you’ve had before, the most insanely meaty mince imaginable, and hugely rich, thanks to proper dripping; it’s the sort of thing mythical grannies made in battered cast-iron pans. A side of Searley’s spuds wouldn’t go amiss, but I can’t think of many better ways to spend £14.50 on lunch. BG 88-94 Farringdon Rd, London EC1R 3EA 10: Heston’s mechanical sweet shop Fat Duck Sweet Trolley. Photograph: Levon Biss for Observer Food Monthly In the previous incarnation of the Fat Duck, before the recent £2.5m refurbishment of its home in Bray, the meal would end with a simple bag of sweets. Well, not that simple: the apple pie caramel had an edible wrapper and one of the petit fours took the form of a playing card. Since the restaurant reopened Heston Blumenthal has pushed this idea to an actual sweet shop. When the new £255 tasting menu draws to a close, a trolley arrives bearing a doll’s house that resembles the Fat Duck itself. It opens to reveal an old-fashioned dispenser, activated by a personalised coin received earlier in the meal. This dazzling contrivance, complete with a replica of Blumenthal’s boyhood bedroom and a chimney that puffs smoke, cost £150,000 to build. As Blumenthal says: “It would have been easier to buy a full-size sweet shop, and it’s probably around the same price.” The detail was inspired by dolls houses on display in Windsor Castle, and his characteristically perfectionist approach “probably drove everyone involved slightly bonkers”. The floorboards and roof tiles were handmade and the floors hand-laid “board by board like they would be in a life-sized house. It’s even got real roofing lead surrounding the chimney”. Blumenthal also notes the tiny jars of sweets in the window, a miniature replica of his glasses and “the smallest lightbulbs in the world” illuminating the two rooms. The reason for the elaborate finale? “I wanted to amplify the interactive involvement that guests experience throughout their time at the Fat Duck,” says Blumenthal. “It’s all based on the metaphor of feeling like a kid in a sweet shop, which I want everyone leaving the restaurant to feel.” KF thefatduck.co.uk 11: Alison Roman Now senior food editor at Buzzfeed, Roman worked at US food magazine Bon Appetit for four years where her recipes became something to look forward to: well written, with an innate understanding of flavour. And if you make her terrific rhubarb almond cake, it will be no surprise to find out that – “after leaving college a little early to go cut marshmallows for a living” – she spent years working as a pastry chef in LA, San Francisco and at Momofuku Milk Bar in New York. She’s just signed a two-book deal with Random House US with the first, Dining In, scheduled for autumn 2017. SM 12: Crepe Suzette at the Ritz One of the grandest set pieces of restaurant theatre in one of London’s grandest rooms. You are sitting with a friend at the Ritz. You may have had, say, John Williams’s brilliant langoustine in bisque with squid ink, partridge cooked in a pot with black truffles, perhaps a glass of pinot noir. Yet there is still something mysteriously missing. You watch as an elegant trolley is wheeled to a neighbouring table, a tin-lined copper pan taken out. There are vessels of orange juice, citrus rind in syrup, a bottle of Grand Marnier. On a plate sit four folded pancakes like monogrammed handkerchiefs. Devid Isabella sprinkles sugar from high into the hot pan, stirs quickly, adds butter. The rarefied air is scented with caramel. A splash of orange. The fragrance now like making marmalade. Crepes are added, unfolded, refolded, kept almost crisp. Then whoosh! The spirit and room lights with stuttering purple flame. Two plates are laid, pancakes added, sauce spooned, and a scoop of vanilla-flecked ice cream. Suddenly you know what you’re missing is a taste of history: the Ritz’s crepes Suzette served here since 1906. Inspired, you switch your order. I’ll have what she’s having, you say. AJ 13: Uncover booking app Tired of not being able to get into fashionable restaurants at short notice? Uncover promises a solution: an app that lets you check availability and book last-minute with a couple of taps. Uber, but for restaurants. You get access, Uncover takes a cut, and in exchange for keeping some tables free, restaurants get to welcome well-heeled, high-spending users. The company has now been bought by Velocity, another app which lets you pay on your phone without all that faff involving card machines. Later this month, the combined app is re-launching as Velocity 2.0, which will handle everything from choosing a restaurant to the tip. “Our users spend on average 14% more than regular customers,” says Alex MacDonald, Velocity’s co-founder, “so the offer to the restaurants is clear.” The app will also have a version for corporate accounts, which will integrate with company expense systems. EC velocityapp.com 14: Guest chefs Bertrand Grébaut and James Lowe at Lyle’s in Shoreditch, London. Photograph: Pål Hansen for Observer Food Monthly James Lowe is at the pass with Septime’s Bertrand Grébaut . They work quietly, intently. They smile and tweak a plate or two. They are simpatico. There is a synergy. You’d think they had worked together in Paris for months not a couple of days as part of Lowe’s Guest Series at Lyle’s in east London. There is a lot of guest cheffing around, it is officially A Thing. From Northcote’s Obsession line-up in Lancashire to the Seahorse in Devon and Nathan Outlaw in Cornwall. But it is London where it’s really taken hold. Isaac McHale’s Clove Club hosted Jorge Vallejo from Mexico City in September last year, and Robin Gill from the Dairy has a guest-chef-driven Bloodshot Supper Club once a month, kicking off at a nocturnal 1am. Even venerable J Sheekey has a series with female cooks including Olia Hercules and Anna Jones starting soon. Both McHale and Lowe were part of February’s Gelinaz extravaganza, when 16 chefs from the UK and Europe descended on their kitchens for a night, but you sense Lowe is more comfortable with less gaudy events, something perhaps more lasting and meaningful. “Every month, we get someone in who uses new techniques, style, ingredients,” he says. “I love seeing how people work, they way they think and approach something. Before Lyle’s, I used to travel all over to eat at restaurants, in the States, Spain, France, Denmark. Sometimes I’d fly somewhere just for a lunch on a day off! Since we opened, I haven’t really done that.” Asked for his favourite moments of the Guest Series, he cites getting up at 7am to drive to Brighton to get seawater, on to Lewes for vegetables, then Kent for fruit and Lincolnshire for 35kg of wild eel. “Spending the next 12 hours filleting them and finishing at 4am,” he says, “was one of the most intense experiences I’ve had.” AJ theguestseries.com 15: Laurie Colwin’s Home Cooking An American novelist and short story writer who died in 1992, at the age of 48, might seem an unlikely cult figure. But, with no less than Nigella a fan – you may have spotted her reading from Colwin’s Home Cooking on Simply Nigella – that is what she has become. Unlike today’s cookbooks, Home Cooking and More Home Cooking are slim paperbacks without photos. Recipes are woven into the text like anecdotes (“I ate eggplant constantly: with garlic and honey, with spaghetti, with fried onions and Chinese plum sauce” might be all you get). She encourages getting it wrong, with Stuffed Breast of Veal: A Bad Idea the ominous title of one essay. But the joy of reading Colwin is as much in the way she leaves you feeling hungry and inspired, amused and uplifted as in the recipes. Although her fried chicken is pretty definitive. SM 16: Wine on tap For years it was simple: if a pub was selling wine out of a tap, it was best to stick to beer. Even when the range wasn’t limited to “medium”, “dry” or “sweet”, this was a serving method that seemed to make good wines bad, and bad wines undrinkable. Over the past year, however, taps have been creeping back into some of London’s best wine-led bars and restaurants, from Michael and Charlotte Sager-Wilde’s California specialist Mission in Bethnal Green, to the branches of the consistently excellent Vinoteca group. This isn’t a cost-cutting exercise: the wines are seriously good, and actually taste fresher than they would from a bottle. DW 17: Top restaurants in art galleries These days, it’s not enough for high-end galleries to merely offer white walls and a gift shop: they also need a deluxe restaurant on site with a big-name chef at the helm. This is true of the new Gagosian gallery in Mayfair. Soon after the 18,000-sq-ft space opened off Berkeley Square last September, it was announced that River Cafe owner Ruth Rogers would be taking over the ground floor. It must have been an attractive offer: despite its popularity, the River Cafe hasn’t branched out since it opened in Hammersmith three decades ago. This venture, led by in-house chefs Sian Owen and Joseph Trivelli, will open next year. Mark Hix is less averse to diversifying: he has launched seven new restaurants since his Oyster & Chop House appeared in Farringdon in 2008. Now he’s taken charge of Pharmacy 2 at Damien Hirst’s Newport Street Gallery in Vauxhall. It revives the medical theme of Hirst’s original restaurant in Notting Hill, with surgical equipment on display and giant polyurethane pills for seats. This – along with the recently opened Anthony Demetre restaurant, Osteria, at the Barbican – goes to show just how magnetic the food world has become. KF 18: Coracle fishing Welsh coracle fishermen in Camarthen, Wales. Photograph: Levon Biss for Observer Food monthly When mankind first took to the water, it is likely they did so in a coracle. A small, round boat constructed by stretching waterproof fabric around a bent wood frame, coracles are still used to fish for salmon and sea trout on the rivers of Wales, and March sees the start of the season. Fishing is done in darkness when there is little or no moon so canny fish can’t see the nets. Fishermen gather on the riverbank, each carrying their coracle on their back, resembling giant black beetles. Working in pairs, they steer their coracles downstream close to the bank with a net stretched between them. The net is only 18-inches deep so the salmon have a sporting chance and the pickings are not exactly rich. But this ancient tradition is in mortal danger. There is only one coracle maker and six pairs of fishermen on the River Towy, the main coracle fishing river in Wales, but it seems the final nail will be hammered into the coffin with the heavy hand of legislation. In the name of conservation, the Environment Agency is pushing for a blanket ban on all salmon fishing with nets. After millennia of coracle fishing, 2016 may be its last season ever. KH 19: The Heron Were someone to ask you where to go for a great Thai meal in London, you might say Smoking Goat or Som Saa. What you might not – but should – suggest is a restaurant in the basement of an unassuming pub which is tucked off the distinctly unfashionable Sussex Gardens in Paddington. It’s not hip, it’s not a pop up and yes, you can book. And when your waiter asks you how spicy you’d like your order, know that this is not a challenge. “Slightly spicy” actually means plenty hot. A whole section of the menu is devoted to salads such as som tam and larb enhanced by salted crab or minced catfish. Even the cashew salad is great: salty nuts with slim slices of bird’s eye chilli, red onion and teeny refreshing wedges of lime. SM 1 Norfolk Crescent, London W2 2DN 20: J. Kenji López-Alt Managing culinary editor of Serious Eats, J Kenji López-Alt‘s scientific background makes him a perfect guide to the kitchen’s hard questions. Don’t know how to keep the structure of apple slices in pies, or the difference between temperature and heat? López-Alt does. He’s cooked steak on the bone, off the bone, from chilled, at room temperature, salted immediately before cooking, hours before cooking, with a dozen other variables, so you can get your grill right first time, to your taste. His relaxed, easy way with words extends to his view of food – from his 2015 Thanksgiving blog: “At the end of the day, it’s only food … so long as it’s gotten friends and family to gather around the table, it’s done its job.” That said, his book The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science, is mind-bogglingly detailed and rewarding. HO’N 21: Freddie Janssen’s F.A.T sandwiches Freddie Janssen. Photograph: Rebecca Reid / Evening Standard / eyevine Twice a month you’ll find Freddie Janssen at Druid Street market, in London’s Bermondsey, serving up her F.A.T. sandwiches to a dedicated following. Her mainstays have been a classic grilled cheese with cucumber dill pickle and, in a twist on the cheese’n’pickle theme, kimchi and stilton. This year, the menu will change every month, with occasional specials such as the Ultimate Meatball (pork and fennel meatballs with pickled fennel and walnut and rocket pesto) joined by a buttermilk fried chicken sandwich (brined overnight in pickle juice) with a pickled jalapeno slaw and kimchi hot sauce mayo. But don’t worry: the cheese sandwiches will be back. With a base like Druid Street, sourcing ingredients is easy: bread and burger buns for the sandwiches are from St John, cheese is from Neal’s Yard and the pickles are all made in her Clapton kitchen. Janssen moved to London from Holland in 2008 and worked in advertising before becoming marketing manager of Shoreditch restaurant Lyle’s. She founded F.A.T., a pop-up cafe, supper club and purveyor of pickles in 2009, but what started as a hobby has snowballed. Her first cookbook, the aptly named Pickled, is published next month. SM fffaaattt.com 22: Breakfast at Dandy cafe Last summer, Andy Leitch and Dan Wilson removed 10 tonnes of rubbish from two shipping containers, in which they created their ideal neighbourhood restaurant. Raw timber fit-out? Yes. Good coffee, cheery atmosphere, corrugated plastic roof that amplifies the rain? Check, check, check. Small plates? Of course. Minimal intervention wines? Yes, three by the glass: red, white and “weird”. So far, so good, so Hackney. It’s weekend brunch where the magic happens; simple, different, some of the best around. A tiny lamb cutlet where others would serve bacon; crab omelette folded round a rainbow of radish wafers; the season’s first rhubarb, caramelised and sandwiched in brioche. The tall man cooking looks familiar? It’s Alt-J’s Gus Unger-Hamilton, the third Dandy, turning his hand to frying eggs (crisp frill underneath, set whites, yolks that burst soon as you look at them – five stars). No big deal, just friends, good at what they do, quietly getting on with it. HO’N 9-15 Helmsley Place, London E8 23: Moonshine It’s the romance of American moonshine that has long set it apart from more humdrum homemade drinks: introduced by Scots-Irish immigrants who settled in the Appalachians in the late 18th century, the term principally refers to an un-aged whiskey made from corn mash, and often distilled illegally, at night, to avoid detection. Making moonshine at home is still illegal (due to a heady combination of tax matters and lead-poisoning issues), but shifting licensing laws have led to a rise in small-batch distilleries offering un-aged white whiskey, with distillers springing up in the hooch heartland of Tennessee and North Carolina, as well as in more far-flung corners of the US such as the Pacific north west, New England and California. The most well-known brand is Ole Smoky, the first moonshine to be sold in Walmart, but as with beer, gin and bourbon, white whiskey is becoming a niche market, with the focus on innovative and distinguished flavours – Kings County Distillery in New York, for example, produces a moonshine Jim Murray’s Whisky Bible describes as “absolutely spot-on corn whiskey”, noting its “sweet, clean berry-fruit” flavour and awarding it a 92-point score. In truth the moonshine revival has been rumbling since the late 1990s, but in recent years the market has gathered pace: US sales grew to $46m in 2014 — from just $5m in 2011, and with Jack Daniel’s and Jim Beam venturing into un-aged white whiskey, moonshine might finally have to get used to the limelight. LB 24: Martin Parr’s Real Food Twenty years ago Parr’s British Food series highlighted the difference between glossy, aspirational food porn and what was on most people’s plates. That meant harshly lit photographs of sliced white bread, salads of lettuce, cucumber and tomatoes, with a dollop of Branston pickle on the side, as well as tough-looking cakes from an era long before Bake Off. We are all food lovers now, of course, years of bestselling cookbooks, celebrity chefs and affordable foreign travel mean we’re clued up about sourdough, know the difference between za’atar and ras el hanout, and can rustle up a show-stopping bake or two. At least that’s what we tell the world on our Instagram feeds. A perfect time, then for Phaidon to publish an anthology of Parr’s food images, drawn from his archive. (The pigeon eyeing up a dinner of discarded fried chicken is a particular favourite.) There’s also a terrific introduction from St John’s Fergus Henderson, who warns of the dangers of a “two-tier food situation”, of a split between the world of “good meat from animals treated well when alive” and supermarkets selling “anonymous pink meat in plastic”. GG 25: The Dusty Knuckle Bakery For almost two years, the founders of the then fledgling bakery and social enterprise the Dusty Knuckle – Max Tobias, Rebecca Oliver and Daisy Terry – would get up at 5am every Saturday. They’d then bake the dough they’d made at Tobias’s flat in the pizza oven of an obliging local restaurant, selling it to a handful of wholesale customers. Fast-forward to October 2014 and, after successful applications for grants and a competition to occupy a shipping container in a Hackney car park, they were trading full-time. The bakery’s menu is short but perfectly thought out: a small range of sourdough breads, an Italian puff pastry filled with crème patissiere and apple, a sticky bun, and freshly made sandwiches filled with things like burnt aubergine, herb salads, tahini and harissa at lunchtime. Its social enterprise side came via Tobias’s frustration with his previous work: managing a gang prevention programme in east London. “I wanted to develop something with a continued impact, where [young people] could feel they were developing their independence, as opposed to a kind of dependence on services that were always short term and poorly funded.” Their aim is to work with young offenders, early school leavers and the long-term unemployed. That means training and working in the bakery but also holding workshops at youth centres and referral units and, crucially, helping with skills that are vital to employment, such as timekeeping or communicating effectively. “It all seemed fairly straightforward: start a bakery, employ the kids and that’d be that,” says Tobias. “Obviously it’s a little bit more complicated.” SM Abbott Street car park, Kingsland Road, London E8 3DP 26: Professional barista apprenticeship “The goal is to take a young unemployed person who may know nothing about coffee on day one, and within a year make them one of the highly trained baristas in the country.” So says Ben Szobody, of the Professional Barista Apprenticeship programme that recently took its second intake of 16-24 year olds, each previously out of work and education, and keen to learn. The free, government-funded programme – the first of its kind in the UK – is run by Szobody and the charity wing of Brighton-based baptist One Church, in conjunction with a nearby secondary school. Apprentices learn the minutiae of speciality coffee from preparing the perfect espresso, to honing sensory skills, to the business of taking a bean from plant of origin to shiny white cup. Throughout the year-long course, they are placed on paid apprenticeships in one of Brighton’s many independent coffee shops, including Small Batch, whose trainer Laura Holmes is the course’s principal teacher. DH 27: London Union What do Jamie, Nigella and Yotam have in common? Nope, not the first-name-recognition thing. Add Polpo’s Russell Norman, Soho House head honcho Nick Jones and top restaurant critics Giles Coren and Marina O’Loughlin, and you’ve got just a few of the founding investors of London Union, an ambitious plan to turn derelict corners of the city into street-food markets. It’s the brainchild of bar entrepreneur, restaurateur and street-food enthusiast Jonathan Downey and his business partner, Leon co-founder and former school dinners tsar Henry Dimbleby. And you wouldn’t bet against them pulling it off: they have form at this kind of thing with their successful Street Feast empire, which showcases the street-food scene at huge venues in London’s Dalston, Shoreditch and Canada Water – nearly 6,000 went through the doors of the latter site over the last weekend of January, making Hawker House one of the UK’s most visited dining venues. At the core of the new venture is an even more ambitious project: a new super-market for central London (Smithfield has been touted as one possible site) to usurp Borough and rival the likes of Barcelona’s Boqueria in global reputation. BG 28: The new wave of women bakers Sarah Lemke at De Superette in Gent, Brussels. Photograph: Joanna van Mulder for Observer Food Monthly Customers travel from all over to eat the magnificent bread made by Sarah Lemke and her all-female team of bakers at De Superette in the Belgian city of Ghent. And like Laura Hart of Hart’s Bakery in Bristol, Bridget Hugo at London’s Bread Bread, and Carol Choi of Mirabelle in Copenhagen, they’re quietly proving that women can master more than cakes. “Half of my bread team is female,” confirms Chad Robertson, co-owner of San Francisco’s Tartine bakery. “They are all amazingly talented, any of them are capable of leading.” More and more women are approaching Laura Hart at her booming bakery, looking to make bread for a living. “Perhaps the shift from mass production to smaller artisan bakeries is more appealing to women,” she says. “By slowing down our baking rhythms, we don’t need to work through the night, and we get to see our customers enjoying what we’ve made.” Breadmaking as a craft that blends technique and intuition does have more charm than the mechanised drudgery of Chorleywood-style production, and the practice of leaving sourdough to ferment slowly overnight means that antisocial night shifts can be replaced by very early starts. The physicality of the job can be a pro or a con, depending on who you are. Hauling 25kg bags of flour and plunging wooden peels into scorching ovens at 5am isn’t for everyone, but it’s here these women have found their calling, and mastered it. “We have so much fun,” says Lemke. “We get covered in flour, light fires. If you love it, you love it, it’s as simple as that.” ZN 29: Lunch at Books for Cooks My favourite eating space in London is Books for Cooks in Notting Hill. I call it a “space” because it is a strange and delightful mixture of bookshop, cafe (Eric Treuille, the owner, calls it a canteen) and community centre. It was launched in 1983 by Heidi Lascelles, and later run by the late Clarissa Dixon Wright of Two Fat Ladies fame. Eric took over 13 years ago, after he met his wife while browsing the thousands of cookbooks that line the walls. He has made it his own – with his charismatic personality and astonishingly cheap meals (£5 for two courses, £7 for three), prepared from a different book (or books) from his shelves every day. I have been coming here for 10 years, sometimes every day of the working week. At first, I ate by myself, hidden behind a book or a newspaper. Eventually, despite myself, I started talking to other lone souls. They were, on the whole, an interesting bunch – singers, psychologists, poets, a few market traders, other restaurateurs – and a host of anonymous others. Eventually, Eric installed a six-seat table for people coming by themselves and we have formed a community of diners. We squabble and fall out, we laugh and gossip, and comfort each other. Eric is usually there (with sidekicks Marilu and Liv) ribbing us or making jokes as his remarkable staff cook and serve. What you see on the blackboard, three courses, is what you get until it runs out (which it can do by 1pm). Eric is a friend, he catered my wedding, my last book launch, and my 60th birthday. I can’t imagine how diminished my life would be if the place ever closed. So what do you get to eat? Recent favourites have included lamb shoulder with pommes dauphinoise, brisket with polenta and coriander, and salt cod and chorizo – but you never know what you’re going to get. All you know is that it will be delicious (particularly the cakes), ridiculously cheap and displaying hospitality that comes from the heart, not from the profit motive. TL 4 Blenheim Crescent, London W11 1NN 30: Deliciously Stella It was inevitable that the world of healthy eaters on Instagram would inspire a backlash. In May last year, 27-year-old Bella Younger started Deliciously Stella, a play on Ella Woodward’s Deliciously Ella account. Where Ella recommends juices and kale, Stella posts shots of (Creme) eggs with avocado on toast, her “Fab abs” – Fab lollies strapped to her stomach – and tote bags emblazoned with the slogan: “You can’t milk an almond.” She’s working on a stand-up show too. “The only problem is people now expect me to be Stella all the time,” Younger says. “They see me in the shops and ask why I’m not carrying a Lucozade.” EC 31: Black Axe Mangal Chef Lee Tiernan at Black Axe Mangal in Islington, London. Photograph: Adrian Lourie / Evening Standard / eyevine After 10 years with the St John group, chef Lee Tiernan started his Black Axe Mangal as a pop-up in Copenhagen before moving to a permanent site on Highbury Corner at the end of last year. It’s since won raves for its “metal and mangal” offering, matching loud music with a short, punchy, meat-driven menu in a 33-cover space. Few parts of the animal are spared: think hearts, livers, tails and noses, all liberally seasoned and cooked at high heat. Nor is Tiernan afraid to borrow from his friends: his spiced mutton is made with the spice mix from Danny Bowien’s Mission Chinese, and the flatbread recipe is inspired by Tartine in San Francisco. EC 156 Canonbury Road, London N1 2UP 32: Neil Broomfield : from police to pies When Neil Broomfield started selling homemade pies in 2007, he had to fit it in around his day job as a policeman. He baked his wares in a room above the family deli and sold them at farmers’ markets on his days off from keeping the peace. This double life lasted four years, until the awards started piling up and the Great North Pie Co became his full-time concern. Last year, at the British Pie Awards, he took prizes in four categories and his Goosnargh chicken, mushroom and English mustard cream pie was voted best in Britain. If you don’t live in the Manchester area, Great North pies are available at Selfridges and dukeshillham.co.uk. KF 33: 2015 French vintage According to the “rule of five”, France always produces a great vintage in years divisible by five. By all accounts, the rule has held for 2015, with producers in Bordeaux, Burgundy, the Rhône and Champagne talking up the harvest as “exceptional”. This is particularly encouraging for the wine trade in Bordeaux, which has been struggling following a series of lacklustre red vintages. We’ll get to see just how good 2015 really is when Bordeaux producers show their unfinished wines to the press and trade in the spring. But it seems that, for the first time in five years, the quality may go some way towards justifying the hype (and inevitably crazy prices). DW 34: Noble Rot If you’d told Dan Keeling and Mark Andrew back in 2013, when they launched wine magazine Noble Rot , that they’d be the brains behind one of 2015’s most feverishly received openings, they’d have laughed in your face. But that’s exactly what former music A&R man Keeling and Andrew, ex-buyer at Roberson Wine, have pulled off with this wine bar/restaurant. It helps that they handed kitchen duties to Paul Weaver, once of Stephen Harris’s Sportsman. It also helps that Harris co-developed the menu, a whip-smart mix of wine-bar staples (brilliant charcuterie, immaculate cheese), old Sportsman favourites and the odd slam-dunk of a showstopper (halibut braised in oxidised 1998 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru); and that the wine list makes aficionados go all gooey-eyed. Three months in, Noble Rot already looks lived in in just the right way, a 21st-century answer to Robin’s Nest – and we mean that as a compliment. BG 51 Lamb’s Conduit Street, London WC1 35: Tiffany Jesse, fermentation queen Tiffany Jesse, Food alchemist. Photograph: Mark Sanders Tiffany Jesse was given some kefir grains about nine years ago and has been nurturing them ever since. The grains are a culture which can be made into a fermented “milk”. “The end product ranges from mild to super sour,” she says. “It can often be effervescent and is known as the ‘champagne of milk’.” Kefir grains look a bit like cottage cheese and can last a lifetime if you look after them. After fermenting, the thickened milk is strained and the remaining grains go back into a clean glass jar, ready for the process to be repeated as often as you like. If you don’t have a friend with spare grains, you can buy them online (from Ocado, Planet Organic, and Abel and Cole). Jesse drinks kefir every day, often for breakfast. She also makes a kefir quark by letting the whey strain through a muslin cloth. She has a farm in Dorset where she rents out a holiday home, grows vegetables, and keeps chickens and goats and brings up her 10-year-old son, Jesse. If her goats have kids in the summer she will use the raw milk to make her kefir. That, she says, is “the gold standard”. TB themirabelletree.com 36: Matthew Young Mayfields, on Wilton Way in Hackney, won a dedicated following before it closed in September 2014. Jay Rayner wrote: “I imagine that, in years to come, all the people involved here will go on to much bigger things.” Now, one of those things has arrived in the form of Ellory, just the other side of London Fields, which has received similarly warm notices. Mayfields chef Matthew Young is at the helm, along with Jack Lewens, formerly sommelier at Spring. Young wants to offer a stylish, affordable update on French bistro cooking. “We want to serve food that we want to eat ourselves,” says Young, a late starter as a chefwho studied painting at art college. As a chef, he’s a minimalist, a specialist in the art of simplicity, of balancing a few ingredients with little fuss and maximum impact. Think Blackface lamb with anchovy and radicchio, or raw scallop with hazelnut and Jerusalem artichoke. Oh, and a five-course dinner is a relatively modest £38. EC Ellory, 1 Westgate Street, London E8 3RL 37: Istanbul With outposts of Cecconi’s, Zuma and even Pizza East, plus the Ristorante Italia Di Massimo Bottura, Istanbul’s food scene has become truly global. Thankfully, for those craving more traditional Turkish flavours, the city’s homegrown restaurants aren’t doing badly either. Anatolian stalwart Çiya Sofrası, in Kadıköy on the Asian side, continues to impress 29 years after opening, with its array of regional dishes, such as stuffed loquats, lamb with sour plums and roasted borage. Meanwhile, Alancha – which opened last year – brings foraging to Istanbul, with many ingredients on the 18-course tasting menu coming from champion-windsurfer-turned-chef Kemal Demirasal’s own farm. Affordable but delicious food is plentiful. If you see a queue of workers outside a cafe serving whatever its lunchtime speciality is, you can be pretty sure it’s worth joining. Places to seek out include Meshur Filibe Köftecisi on Ankara Caddesi (a few minutes’ walk up from the Sirkeci train station), which serves juicy lamb köfte with green salad and crusty bread; Adem Baba fish restaurant in the pretty Arnavutköy district; and Boris’in Yeri in Kumpakı, which, in its tiny shop, serves little more than plates of the incredibly addictive kaymak – a kind of clotted cream – with local honey drizzled over the top. LM 38: All the afternoon tea in China A mainstay on the Hong Kong culinary scene for decades, afternoon tea has caught on in cosmopolitan Shanghai and, more recently, in Beijing. Despite the capital’s five-star hotels, such as the Peninsula, offering cucumber sandwiches, scones and clotted cream for a while, it’s only become genuinely popular in the past couple of years, says Leon Wang, food and beverages manager of the Ritz-Carlton Beijing, as China’s middle class begin to acquire luxury experiences to go with their luxury goods. So branded afternoon teas have become popular – Lanvin, Issey Miyaki and Godiva chocolates are all involved – with fashionable young women replacing the old clientele of businessmen and tourists. Even Pizza Hut and KFC have started adding afternoon tea to their menus, injecting a little class into deep-pans and chicken wings. YR 39: Noma’s more accessible new restaurant, 108 108’s pork belly. Photograph: Thomas Degner Noma is relocating in 2017, but this year sees the launch of its long-awaited second restaurant. This spring, 108 will open in an old warehouse around the corner from its sibling and be more casual (there’s room for walk-ins) and affordable (à la carte dishes are between £9-£18) but no less ambitious. During a trial run in the Noma dining room, courses included caramelised milk skin stuffed with aged cheese and truffle, and romaine stems wilted in oyster marinade. “We want to create a place where you can drop by on your way home from work for a beer and a main course,” said 108 head chef Kristian Baumann. LE Strandgade 93, DK-1401 Copenhagen 40: Chefs discovering the work/life balance The kitchen-as-war-zone mindset, with 100-plus-hour weeks and hard-nut head chefs, informs the legends of Marco, Gordon et al. But the dinosaur days might be over – or at least changing. Last year, Sat Bains announced that, to improve working conditions, his acclaimed Nottingham restaurant would open only four days a week. “I’m used to the unsocial hours,” Bains explained, “but why should the next generation have to be?” Several high-profile joints, including Le Gavroche and Hibiscus, followed suit, but it’s not an entirely altruistic move: happy staff are less likely to jump ship, and the industry is having trouble finding, and retaining, staff; shorter hours also free up time for development work and lucrative private events. Corbin & King (the Wolseley, the Colony, Bellanger, etc), meanwhile, introduced a flexi-time initiative to entice female talent back after taking time out to raise children. Many chefs have long insisted on a decent work/life balance for their employees (take a bow, Giorgio Locatelli) – but if restaurateurs are at last taking this issue seriously, who knows, maybe they’ll next put their minds to service charges and wages? BG 41: Kombucha In Chinese, Korean and Russian the word for kombucha translates as “tea fungus”. To make it at home, you need a scoby (symbiotic compound of bacteria and yeast) which is mixed with tea and allowed to ferment. The scoby feeds off the tea: the result is a slightly fizzy drink that tastes sour like vinegar. It’s thought to date back to 220BC but since the 1990s it has been made commercially and that’s how you’re most likely to come across it – in a bottle in a health food shop or a hipster grocer. And come across it you will. The global market for commercially made kombucha is estimated to be $1.8bn by 2020. TB 42: Trattoria Da Maria When I yearn for Italy – which is badly and often – I go to the Trattoria Da Maria, in Notting Hill Gate, London. I’ve been coming here since the early 1980s before I worked in Naples and Rome. This is Notting Hill, subject to hyper-inflation of rents and change, and the Neapolitan Ruocco family that runs Da Maria shouldn’t have stood a chance, not after two Starbucks, All Bar One and Prêt appeared. The arrival of Jamie Oliver over the road seemed a final nail in Da Maria’s coffin. I lived in Naples with a season ticket at San Paolo stadium during the years Diego Maradona played there, and I swear: this is the best Neapolitan family cooking north of that Fuorigrotta neighbourhood. Each time a new rival appeared, I watched Da Maria take the blow. But the Ruoccos now thrive – what happened? Pasquale and his wife Maria Rosaria hit on an idea: Napoli Football Club, their passion. Up went the shirt Maradona wore in a match, framed. Up went a mural of the Vesuvian bay and Sophia Loren. Word got around: if you are an Italian in London, this is where you eat like Mamma cooked; if you support Napoli, you get to watch the game. Maradona’s son, Diego Jnr, came for lunch; commentators on Italian TV send “saluti ai tifosi– greetings, fans! – a Da Maria, Notting Hill”, when Napoli kick off. The club’s most-capped player, Giuseppe Bruscolotti, acclaimed the trattoria as “part of our history”. So now, for every match, the place is packed, and they stand six-deep on the pavement outside. EV 87 Notting Hill Gate, London W11 3JZ 43: The Kiwi connection New Zealanders have long been quietly influential on British food. Not just Peter Gordon, but also Margot Henderson, who opened the French House Dining Room with Fergus Henderson in 1992 and now runs Shoreditch’s Rochelle Canteen. Then there’s Monica Galetti, of MasterChef: the Professionals, soon to open her first restaurant, and Juliet Harbutt, founder of the British Cheese Awards. More recently, fellow Kiwis such as Michael Allpress have been crucial to Britain’s growing UK coffee culture, and the link between the two countries has come full circle in the form of Caravan co-founder and chef director Miles Kirby, who was once head chef at … Peter Gordon’s Providores. MT-H 44: The Sportsman’s aged beef project Stephen Harris has always had a keen interest in dairy produce. At the Sportsman, his pub-restaurant near Whitstable in Kent, the Michelin-starred chef churns his own butter and goes out of his way to source raw cream. Lately, he’s been seeing old dairy cows in a new light. “It started when I went to Fäviken in 2011 and Magnus Nilsson was serving retired dairy cow at the restaurant. I tasted the meat and thought, wow, this is extraordinary. Then London started going nuts for old milkers from Galicia.” Why, he wondered, aren’t we making better use of our own old milk cows? As well as producing great meat, wouldn’t it give a boost to the British dairy industry? He brought this up with his supplier Jerry Wilson, at Ottinge Court Farm near Folkestone, and they decided to test it out. Wilson had been selling his old cows to an abattoir for £800-£1,000 and the meat was ending up between burger buns. Harris paid Wilson the going rate for an eight-year-old Friesian crossbreed and, after fattening it for six months, they had it slaughtered in November. The early signs were good. “After hanging it for just three weeks I tasted the fillet, which is usually all texture no flavour, and the taste was incredible. I knew we were on to something.” Retired Kentish dairy cow with tarragon sauce and Camembert potato purée went on the Sportsman’s menu before Christmas and the response was encouraging. By the time I make it to Whitstable in early January, most of the 500kg cow has been used up – the lesser cuts went to a burger chain in Deal, bringing total earnings up to £2,000 – but Harris still has topside left for me to try. He gives it a sear and plates it. I’ve never been wowed by topside before but this is sensational: complex, with a blue cheese funkiness that lingers on the palate. Thankfully, Harris will be taking more of Wilson’s old dairy cows off his hands in the year ahead. KF 45: Leon Aarts & Calais camp kitchens Leon Aart at his Calais ‘Jungle’ camp kitchen. Photograph: Pål Hansen for Observer Food Monthly Feeding people has always been Leon Aarts’s priority. Not so long ago, he was a chef, restaurateur and entrepreneur in the Netherlands, with a wholesale business supplying high-end ingredients such as Wagyu beef and truffles. Now, he heads a team of 60, split between one warehouse and three gas-powered kitchens, serving up to 2,000 meals a day at the migrant camp in Calais. He’s been working there since last October, though his change of career began in 2007 after a business event in Bali, when he felt his attitude shift. “I realised that the successes I had were only on the outside, not the inside,” he says. He initially gave up his food career to start a foundation called Fill the Cup, feeding children in developing countries. His current role distributing food and running kitchens in Calais came after a friend asked him to help out, “and I just said yes”. Most food is donated or bought from fundraising in the UK and the meals are meat-free: rice with a vegetable stew or curry or dal. Before the recent demolition of part of the camp, Aarts supplied emergency packs to those forced to leave. He has also started supplying the small camps of 100-500 people which pop up in the area and is involved in building six small community kitchens in Dunkirk. Now a co-founder of fundraising initiative Nourish, raising money in the UK to feed refugees in Calais, Aarts feels thankful for his big move away from fine dining, concluding: “The most beautiful thing is the connection between human beings, from all nationalities, how we come together and make things happen with limited funds and resources. Everyone supports each other, even in these very difficult circumstances.” BP 46: Sustainable eels Eels have something of an arduous life cycle, and their dwindling stocks are causing alarm. Adult eels migrate from estuarine waters in Europe to spawn in the Sargasso Sea, which surrounds Bermuda. Baby eels – elvers – head back to their roots, a journey that takes two years or more. They cannot feed until they reach fresh water, where they’ll take at least 15 years to reach maturity. Although elvers were once commonplace and considered a delicacy, 80% of those caught in the UK are now used to restock rivers, but there is growing concern about the sustainability of processing eels fished in the wild. Aquaculture seems to be the answer. The Severn and Wye Smokery in Gloucestershire is tackling the issue and is now working with eel farms in Sweden, Denmark and Holland by sending them elvers caught on the River Severn and buying their farmed adult eels in return. KH 47: Tom Kerridge’s chocolate grenades Tom Kerridge was scrolling through Instagram when he noticed a photograph of a giant grenade apparently made of chocolate. “Is it real?” he asked Katie Lodge, the artist responsible. She told him no, the chocolate was fake, to which he replied: “Want to do something cool?” Lodge, a prop designer in the film industry, had been making oversized grenades out of resin and decorating them to look like Ming vases and chocolate eggs. The idea of making an edible version hadn’t occurred to her. With the help of Kerridge and pastry chef Claire Clark, she prepared 200 real-chocolate grenades for her first solo show Bitter Sweet, which opens at east London’s CNB gallery on 22 March. “We want them to be indulgent,” Kerridge tells me. “These will be solid and filled to the rafters with good stuff.” That means fondant, caramel and possibly Turkish delight. Lodge insists she’s not making any political statements by turning instruments of war into chocolate bombs – she’s more interested in how they look – but she does say this: “If you’re going to throw a grenade, throw a chocolate one.” KF 48: Barbara Ketcham Wheaton Barbara Ketcham Wheaton, an American food historian, is 84 years old. She lives a quiet life, in a continuing-care community near Boston. But, for the past 50 years, Wheaton has been engaged in a project of astonishing ambition. More or less single-handedly, she has created a database called The Cook’s Oracle, designed to record the contents of every cookbook published up to 1900 in all the major European languages. It’s now computerised, but when Wheaton started, she wrote down the entries on ‘McBee’ cards, sticking knitting needles through holes to search. The idea is that cooks and historians alike will be able to compare every historic soufflé recipe ever published; every tip for flakier pastry or better digestion. Wheaton has 130,000 individual entries from books by more than 6,000 authors, but the categories keep expanding. Her list of search terms ranges from hospitality to heat; from porcini to porpoise. The database reveals the extent to which cookbooks in the past contained not just delicious morsels but strange medical advice, such as remedies for an easy childbirth or handy cures for baldness: “all this crank stuff,” as Wheaton puts it. Then again, as she wryly observes, modern cookbooks still mirror our health worries and “anxieties about what should I feed my children?” The database is not online yet, although a version should be live this year. Not that it can ever really be finished: there is always another way to search. Wheaton – a delightfully humorous person – knows she has set herself a vast task, so, “It’s just as well I’m only 84.” BW 49: Alan Micks It’s taken 25 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall for organic farmers to recolonise Berlin’s lush river-laced Brandenburg farmland. This raging farm-to-table moment has triggered a wave of restaurants staffed by chefs from around the world, such as 34-year-old Alan Micks, from Limerick, who has his stove at the Hotel Michelberger’s eponymous restaurant, the go-to watering hole/lunchroom for Berlin’s film and music industry elite, by the River Spree in the Freidrichshain district. After starting out at Dublin’s stately Hotel Merrion, Micks paid his dues at London’s Lanesborough, Auckland’s Hotel DeBrett and New York’s WD-50. The globetrotting wisdom shows in his fine, firm hand on the venison, boar, beef, pork and fish delivered by his coterie of Brandenburg hunters, farmers and fishermen. Micks’s resolutely local, wholly organic menu is a first among Berlin hotels, and on the card last month was a roast duck breast with liquorice, quince and salt-baked parsips, as well as wild venison with beetroot, homemade sausage, and pickled walnuts. His potato mash is famed for the subtle dark, sweet notes delivered by smoked butter. The historical ironies of the dish are not lost on Micks. “Bit sad, isn’t it,” he says. “An Irishman comes to Berlin and gets known for potatoes. Now we can’t take it off the menu.” GM 40, Warschauer Strasse 39, 10243 Berlin 50: The Bramble The Bramble began life at Fred’s Bar – a notorious London member’s bar in the 80s with a reputation for shenanigans and the late great Dick Bradsell, who died last month, at the helm. Having the pleasure of working with Bradsell at the beginning of my career, the Bramble remains one of my favourite of his creations. Faithful to a classic format – a sour base sweetened with a little liqueur – Dick’s mastery of carefully balancing ingredients has turned it into a true modern classic. What made him so pioneering is that he created really drinkable drinks with ingredients that everyone could get hold of, and in this way they became universal. I love the egalitarian approach, which brought about a cocktail revival in the UK. This outlook, coupled with a dedication to a high-end level of service and wicked sense of humour, made Dick a virtuoso in navigating social situations. He knew what his customer wanted to drink before they knew themselves and where to position them in the room. I remember being at his house creating the menu for Party Bar and he’d gone out the night before and bought a ton of kids’ crayons and swaths of paper. We drew the menu across the sheets and fixed them to the wall of the bar that night. All customers had to do was point at these giant drawings and we’d get to work.

Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA Updated at 2.13pm BST 1.49pm BST José Mourinho has offered his congratulations to Leicester and Claudio Ranieri, via a CAA Sports UK statement which read: I want to congratulate everyone connected to LCFC; players, staff, owners and fans. I lost my title to Claudio Ranieri and it is with incredible emotion that I live this magic moment in his career. A bit different to his comments in 2008, when he described Ranieri as having “the mentality of someone who doesn’t need to win”: He is almost 70 years of age. He has won a Supercup and another small trophy, and he is too old to change his mentality. 1.25pm BST The latest Football Weekly podcast is here, with James Richardson joined by John Ashdown, Paolo Bandini, Philippe Auclair and Iain Macintosh to discuss all things Leicester. Updated at 1.30pm BST 1.05pm BST Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri and his players have been talking after making it in for training today. Ranieri: It means the job is good. I am very, very happy now because maybe if I won this title at the beginning of my career maybe I would forget. Now I am an old man I can feel it much better. I said every time I am very happy for the fans, for the chairman and for all the Leicester community. I don’t know the secret. The players, the heart, the soul and how they play. My message to the fans is now to keep going, we want to improve a lot. Midfielder Danny Drinkwater on watching the title being secured: It was brilliant, all the lads were together whilst it happened and it kind of sums us up as a group of lads. I’ve not [known a bond like it], and I think the rest of the lads would answer the question the same. It’s a special moment for us lot. Vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha on what comes next: We are not a team who produces players to be developed later by other teams. All players want to stay and keep on fighting together to see how far they can go. So selling players is not on our agenda. Leicester players celebrate at training.

In the past few hours we’ve learned: Leicester City’s Thai owners are pledging to do their best to keep their title-winning squad in place for next season. Unsurprisingly, the winning team gathered for a mega-party at the home of striker Jamie Vardy last night, documented on Instagram, on Twitter, and, speculatively, by Guardian cricket writer Elizabeth Ammon. Peter Soulsby, the directly elected Mayor of Leicester, said the team’s success was a bigger boost to the city than reburial of Richard III. Gary Lineker has corrected his earlier scepticism over the appointment of Claudio Ranieri as LCFC boss. It was just a slip of the thumb, honest... One Leicester City fan has walked away from a £5 bet on his home team, placed at the beginning of the season, with enough cash for a downpayment on a house. 12.28pm BST I just scoured my spam folder and found a whole hidden bunch of Leicester City fans who had sent celebratory emails. In no particular order, let’s start with Simon Lake, from Australia, who for some reason is reminded of Basic Instinct. Why? Read on: I’m writing from a foxhole in Brisbane having taken an emergency day’s leave to help soak up the events of this morning, along with the previous nine months. I’m currently ‘Home Alone’ with my friends ‘Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner’ (see below). It’s difficult to know where to begin except to say that I’ve felt compelled to utilise the ‘Love’ icon on Facebook for the first time. It’s also the first time I’ve ever submitted an e-mail to a ‘Blog’. Do I get a badge or something? I’m not sure how this area of life operates - must I cough up a special memory to get it published? Would it help if I told you that the first ‘18’ rated film I saw at the cinema was ‘Basic Instinct’ and I had my sleeping bag in tow? The film was utter tosh but it whiled away a couple of hours before heading down to Filbert Street where tickets were going on sale the following morning for Leicester’s 1992 Wembley play-off final against Blackburn Rovers. Arriving at 11pm, I thought we were early, only to find we were still down the street and around the corner. I also thought we were well prepared until a couple rocked up with a double bed and proceeded to assemble it on the pavement. I was mildly surprised that someone didn’t appear in the morning to serve them breakfast! There have been highs and lows, but as the saying goes: ‘Foxes Never Quit’. So proud of Claudio and team! As an aside, if any of your readers are travelling to Leicester from Brisbane this weekend, have a spare airline ticket and want to talk football all the way, then I’m your man! I’m totally happy to travel economy and am confident that I could offer a ‘good time’. I need to be back for work on Monday though! Is that asking a lot? Simon Lake’s friends ‘Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner’, who are keeping him company while he celebrates Leicester’s win from his home in Brisbane, Australia Photograph: Simon Lake Paul Lennon writes from Moscow, where he teaches theory of knowledge at the city’s Anglo-American School. He expects to see Leicester tops cropping up in PE soon: Working at The Anglo American School here in Moscow means we see all the different football shirts on display every day in PE. To this point not one Leicester top! Soon to change after last night and the season as a whole. A brilliant example to these young people from 60 odd different countries that leadership, team work, belief, quality, tactical intelligence, speed, movement and fitness can provide a platform for impossible dreams to come true. Welcome to visit our School any time King Claudio! Elsewhere in Russia, in the town of Votinsk, in the Udmurt Republic, Andrew Beznosov is celebrating with fish pie. He writes: Hello from Russian town Votkinsk, where we are celebrating this incredible victory! This is a fishy pie with ‘lavrushka’. Andrew Beznosov from Votkinsk, in the Udmurt Republic, Russia, sent in this picture of a celebratory fish pie Photograph: Andrew Beznosov Arne Anka from Sweden says he can finally hold his head up around his friends who support Premier League big dogs like Liverpool and Manchester United: I started watching English football in the 1970s on Swedish television as a teenager, and then, for some reason, LCFC became my team. I followed them through good and bad, both in England and on TV and thought that the two League cups would be the best they’d ever do. And my Swedish friends, all ManU, Liverpool, Arsenal etc fans...they have always asked me why? Why do you support that team??? Now they know!!!! .I’ve been up all night...Party Vardy Party LCFC! And finally, a rebuke from one reader who objects to the inclusion of glory-hunting politicians who have appeared on this blog. Marco Grandi writes: It would be good if you avoid giving coverage to politicians (whether left or right / Labour or tory) who congratulates Leicester or tries to get onto Leicester bandwagon. It is ridiculous and an insult to us fans. Zac Goldsmith as you put it does not even know where QPR plays, and it would probably have no idea what LCFC has achieved. Somebody has written him a script this morning so that he can connects with normal people in his messages. Be adult, be intelligent, and avoid putting that shit up. Thanks. 11.53am BST The news is still sinking in for Leicester fans. This contribution comes from Prakash Shah, who doesn’t give his location but I’m guessing he’s a Leicester man: I’ve followed Leicester for 37 years. I went to my first game when Gordon Milne was in charge and Steve Lynex and Alan Smith were leading the line. My friends and I used to walk home up the treelined New Walk dissecting the game and dodging the police cordon for the away fans around the station. This was at the old Filbert St and we’d recall moments of games past, always dreaming of this day. This feeling that Man U, Chelsea and Liverpool fans (at least the older ones) and CIty feel is their right was always just a dream for us. Just a dream. It isn’t today. I didn’t go to many games this year, with kids and family and working away it just isn’t possible, but inside, there’s still that hope, then nerves and last night ... realisation. I had a silent mosh pit around my living room (as the family were in bed - it’s a school night) with my arms aloft. That’s the feeling I want as a fan. That’s why I love football. Dreams and feelings. Now we have a title. We made history. We’ll never be forgotten and I’ll remember. I have this. Wow. And the Foxes’ army of overseas fans are still writing in, as well. Saurav Samaddar, from India, says he hopes the credit for the victory will go to Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri. I hope this title gives Ranieri his due as one of the great tacticians of the game. Discussions about his (hopefully now dead) reputation as a nearly man have always ignored the fact that in nearly each of those cases, he had his teams punching above their weight, as opposed to underachieving and falling short. Leicester’s team spirit which was carefully maintained and honed is a significant part of this success, but so is Ranieri getting the tactics just right each time. Also, hope Nigel Pearson is invited to the celebrations to acknowledge his contributions to the making of this team. 11.49am BST More on Jamie Vardy’s Premier League party last night. Admittedly, this one is pure speculation by our cricket writer, Elizabeth Ammon. The recycling bin outside Jamie Vardy's house this morning pic.twitter.com/iuLXdSuqof — Elizabeth Ammon (@legsidelizzy) May 3, 2016 11.35am BST Leicester City’s Premier League won led to a near doubling of Twitter activity in the UK, the microblogging service has said. According to Twitter’s data team, there were 5.5m tweets sent in response to the Foxes’ unexpected victory last night. They have put together this special tribute visualisation made out of congratulatory tweets from fans around the world. A special tribute visualisation made by Twitter’s analytics team to celebrate Leicester City’s league win last night.

Champions of England. pic.twitter.com/WRwfysTn2N — Leicester City (@LCFC) May 2, 2016 11.11am BST Gambling Leicester fan walks away with enough winnings for a house deposit Life-changing is a bit of hyperbole that gets bandied around quite a lot in sports coverage. But for one Leicester fan, Lee Herbert, the Foxes’ win has quite literally changed his life. Herbert was prescient enough to lay a £5 bet on Leicester winning the Premier League right at the start of the season, when they were battling odds of 5,000-1. Now, after cashing in part of the bet early, he’s walked away with £20,600, which he says he will use as the downpayment on a house for him and his fiancee. Asked what spurred him to place the bet, Herbert told Radio 5 Live this morning: I’d seen them come up from the Championship and they played brilliant in the Championship. They were trying to find their feet in their first season in the Premier League and they pulled off the great escape. And then they got Ranieri in as manager, and I just thought they have got something there, I could tell. I saw the odds at 5,000-1 and just thought however’s put those odds on are not giving them enough credit. Herbert admitted that he was plagued with the temptation to cash in his bet early, despite early in the season telling himself he would let it ride all the way to the finish. “But when it got to Easter the cash-out value was £14,500, and being a Leicester fan you get let down sometimes,” he said. “I just thought I could lose everything.” He took two pounds out - netting him winnings of £5,600 - and let the remaining £3 go all the way. Asked what he would do with the cash, Herbert said: I’m going to enjoy some of it. We are going to have a party next Saturday. But most of the money is going to go towards a deposit on a house for me and Kerry, my fiancee. Leicester City: their Premier League title glory in numbers. Updated at 11.27am BST 10.40am BST The Leicester City bandwagon is rolling, and politicians are keen to jump on. Tory London mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith, who has taken a hammering over accusations of racial stereotyping in his campaign against Labour rival Sadiq Khan, told LBC News this morning that he is hoping to replicated the Foxes’ unexpected success. Zac Goldsmith says “I’m hoping to do a bit of a Leicester City, zoom in from behind and win” https://t.co/ccRUGeu5ZW pic.twitter.com/OuMlLVeSxm — LBC (@LBC) May 3, 2016 As my colleague Matthew Weaver points out, this from the man who man who didn’t know which football team plays at Loftus Road... 10.21am BST Foxes fans from around the World continue to get in touch with their stories, including this beautiful scene described by Leicester City fan Sunil Suri, who was at Stamford Bridge last night. Sunil writes: Sunil Suri with a friend outside Stamford Bridge last night Photograph: Sunil Suri I was at Old Trafford on Sunday and thought I’d chance it and get a ticket to the Chelsea-Spurs game. I was sat in Shed End lower tier with the Chelsea fans who made it feel like a Leicester home game. I was wearing my Leicester shirt and so become something of an adopted mascot. Towards the end of the game someone lifted me onto their shoulders and hundreds of fans pointed at me and sang “Leicester City, we’ll win it for you”. It was pretty amazing. Unfortunately, my phone was dead, so I was wondering if you could put this on your live blog on the off chance that one of the many Chelsea fans who filmed the scene/took a photo might send it in to you. If not, never mind, somewhat etched in my memory. Thanks for the live blog, I’ve barely slept all night and now ran out to get the morning papers. Still real. Comments and congratulations are coming in from all around the world. Abishek Dubey emailed us from Hong Kong to say: Been a crazy year. Expected the foxes to reach the Champions league, but this is unbelievable. Even after watching the players celebrate at vardy’s place, I felt like this is all a dream. I guess until I don’t see Wes Morgan lifting the trophy, I won’t believe it. Morgan, the same guy who gave away a penalty at Anfield last year when the ball hit his face. I am not laughing anymore. Richard Leong emailed with this comment: Arsenal fan from Vancouver, Canada, now living in Brunei...what an amazing season for the Foxes. Gripping drama this season! A story for the ages. And Nelson Zacharia, who didn’t give his location, simply said: The king of the year no one like this :::::yeah I’m very surprised Updated at 10.22am BST 10.01am BST BreatheSport points out a curious synchronicity in the careers of Leicester City keeper Kasper Schmeichel and his father, Peter, the great Manchester United goalie.

Will his son go on to have such a glittering career? 9.47am BST Despite the gravitas of yesterday’s Spurs-Chelsea clash, and its implications for Leicester, Claudio Ranieri had chilled day. He told Sky News: I had lunch with my mother and at 8 o’clock I watched the match Asked what the first title means to him, Ranieri replied: It means the job is good. I’m very happy now. Maybe if I had won this title at the beginning of my career I would have forgot. But now I am an old man, I can celebrate 9.39am BST Keith Vaz pops up everywhere.

Then, on Monday night, Tottenham threw away a two-goal lead against Chelsea, sealing Leicester’s spot at the top of the table.

At the time of Ranieri’s appointment, the former England star turned football pundit and Walker’s Crisps man Gary Lineker tweeted: “Claudio Ranieri? Really?” Now, he claims that tweet slipped out before he had a chance to finish... 9.19am BST Here is a bit more cribbed from Radio 4’s coverage this morning by Matt Weaver: Sir Dave Brailsford, the former performance director of British Cycling, said Leicester’s success is a “fantastic case study in sport” that all sports teams can learn from.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that British Cycling has been trying to analyse how it can follow Leicester’s example as it prepares for the Olympic games. “Our sports science guys were up here a month and a half ago meeting with the guys here and having a look at what’s going on - that’s sport we all trying and learn from each other,” he said. Brailsford added: “The refreshing thing about this particularly story is that it just goes against every thing – the established norms and the conventional wisdom about how to win the premier league. It just shatters everything that everybody has established. So it just an exciting opportunity to learn. “There’s an old saying in sport that the star team will always beat the team of stars. You quite often hear people saying that, and it’s very rarely seen in fact, but this is a really good example of that.’ “They obviously had the talent, but the recruitment of that talent, how did they identify that talent, how did they pull it together, how did they developed goal clarity. The journey they went through was exciting, they built momentum, Vardy’s run of scoring goals, that gave them belief and you could see the belief growing all the time. So it is just a fantastic case study in sport.” 9.18am BST My sports desk colleague Stuart James has written the inside story of Leicester’s improbable season, including details of Claudio Ranieri’s appointment, the club’s unorthodox training and injury-recovery regimens, and the tricks that brought them the Premier League title. Here’s a taster: In July last year Claudio Ranieri was enjoying a break in Italy when he received a phone call from Steve Kutner, his agent, that would end up changing the face of English football in a way no one could have imagined. Kutner had been attempting to convince Jon Rudkin, Leicester City’s director of football, that Ranieri was worth considering as the Premier League club’s new manager and finally there was news of a breakthrough. Ranieri was out of work at the time but keen to return to management, in particular in England, where he had fond memories from his time in charge of Chelsea and still owned a property in London going back to those days at Stamford Bridge more than a decade earlier. Several Championship clubs had been sounded out without success when Nigel Pearson’s sacking at Leicester presented Kutner and Ranieri with a window of opportunity. Kutner sensed that Leicester were sceptical about Ranieri, yet he refused to be discouraged. He submitted Ranieri’s CV, listing the distinguished clubs the 64-year-old had managed, together with his record – a Copa del Rey and Super Cup winner with Valencia, Coppa Italia winner at Fiorentina, plus second-place finishes in the Premier League, Ligue 1 and twice in Serie A – and kept chipping away. “I just wanted to get Claudio in front of them, because I was sure that they would be impressed,” Kutner says. Related: Leicester City’s title triumph: the inside story of an extraordinary season | Stuart James 8.54am BST Leicester mayor: Premier League win a bigger boost than Richard III reburial Peter Soulsby, the directly elected Mayor of Leicester, said the team’s success was a bigger boost to the city than reburial of Richard III. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he said: Barely 12 months ago we were reburying Richard III in our cathedral and we thought it couldn’t get any better we had the eyes of the world on us at that time. And that has made a major boost to the economy - they reckon many tens of millions of pounds have come in on the back of that. We didn’t think it could get any better, well it has, the premier league is even bigger than that... It has been said that we are somehow being repaid for having reburied King Richard with dignity and honour in our cathedral. I suspect the reality is that it is down to a brilliant team and amazing leadership from two managers - Nigel Pearson and now Claudio Ranieri. Soulsby also portrayed Leicester’s success as a victory for multiculturalism. It is probably the most diverse city anywhere in Europe and many people in Leicester see the team as a metaphor for the city, showing what you can achieve when you bring together a very diverse group of people who others have written off. Updated at 9.01am BST 8.50am BST More details are emerging of the Leicester squad’s big party last night. It looks like it was a good one. Here’s Wes Morgan, Leicester’s captain, who is so delighted he has had to have a lie down.

Siddarth Upasani, of India, was on the phone to a London-based friend last night when he came up with a world-class comparison outlining just how unlikely it was. He told me in an email: I was on the phone last night, talking to a friend studying in London, while watching Chelsea-Spurs. She isn’t interested in football amazingly. Anyway, once Hazard scored, I interrupted her rather rudely and said: ‘Listen, you need make sure you keep this in mind for tomorrow so that you don’t feel left out. Leicester City, a football club, have won the Premier League.’ She asked if this was big news. Exasperated, I explained as follows: ‘Imagine Afghanistan winning the Cricket World Cup. And we are still nowhere near describing Leicester’s victory.’ 8.42am BST How do you party when you’ve just won the Premier League? Becky Vardy, wife of Foxes striker Jamie Vardy, has given us a bit of insight with this Instagram snippet of the celebrations in Leicester last night. 8.38am BST Leicester City’s Thai owners are hoping to resist attempts by bigger teams to pick off the cream of their league-winning squad, according to AP. Big-money suitors are expected to come calling for star players including midfielders Riyad Mahrez and N’Golo Kante, striker Jamie Vardy and goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel. But, speaking on Thai television, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, son of club chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, said: We are not a team who produces players to be developed later by other teams. All players want to stay and keep on fighting together to see how far they can go. So selling players is not on our agenda. Aiyawatt said that when his father bought the Foxes, winning the league “was not what we dared to dream”. He went on: He was already proud of being the owner of an English Premier League team. Now he has owned an English Premier League Champion team, he can’t be prouder. I have to say on his behalf that he has managed the club with his heart and he just hopes to gain a reputation for the country. The owners are already planning a visit to Thailand, even though a a similar visit last year resulted in some youth team players involved in a scandal which contributed to the firing of manager Nigel Pearson. Aiyawatt said: They are coming to Thailand very, very soon. This is unbelievable. Thai people should be given a lot of credit as all players acknowledge how much support they have been given.

(Thanks to all of those who’ve contacted me, it’s been a joy reading your messages. Sorry I couldn’t feature them all.) Pater Edmund Waldstein messages to say: I’m a Cistercian monk in Austria, and a Liverpool fan, but I am so pleased about Leicester. I’ve even written a blogpost about it. Now, I don’t write football live blogs very often, but I’m going to stick my neck out and say a contribution from a Cistercian monk is a first. Welcome! Gaurav Pandit emails: Congratulations to Leicester City from someone born in India, living in the US and vacationing in Mauritius, and is a Chelsea fan. Not that Chelsea should get any credit for their great achievement, but I am glad we did our bit. It feels great to hand over the trophy to City - there is no shame in it. Given how Chelsea season unfolded, this is the best outcome we could hope for. A fairytale to remember for years! Tom McMahon drops into my inbox from Pinawa, Manitoba, Canada: Every true sports fan in the world must have been cheering for “Lester” and Vardy and “soccer”! We love sports because we believe miracles do happen! Today, Leicester is king of the world! And Deepak Nandhakumar adds: 12 noon here in Kerala, India. Have just woken up after watching the match till 2am (its all right, I’m on study leave!). Just sitting here reading all about Leicester with a big, stupid smile on my face. Lifelong Man U fan but have been rooting for the Foxes from the start of the season. Finally found my 2nd team (Soon to be first if Man U continue the decline).

Here’s some more of your messages. Saurya Sengupta writes from Kolkata, India: Leicester’s win has pretty much all of us here who’ve ever watched a game of football in bawling like babies. My girlfriend who doesn’t follow football made it a point to keep track of their matches and hope and pray that they’d win. I don’t think India’s ever come together in such alliance for any football team (since our national team does nothing) – and that’s A LOT of support. This win is definitely one for Ranieri, the perennial nice guy of management … But, it’s also a message to journalists across the world (looking at you, Guardian :P) to stop trying to predict outcomes in football, especially in leagues. It isn’t even as if Leicester were an exception. Spurs were given no shouts of finishing in the top four, very few thought Newcastle would be battling against the drop, and the less said about Chelsea, the better. Point taken. Basnet Govinda, who runs the Leicester City Nepal fans Facebook page, has been in touch to say: I’m being a great fan of Leicester City football club … So I can proudly said that the offiical fan club from Nepal was managed by me … hurrayyy.” Robben, also in Nepal, has dropped me a line too: As a lifelong Chelsea fan from Nepal, with the earthquake and the poor season I had to endure, today’s fight by our team to hand Leicester the title was simply glorious. Tears rolling down with every story people are sharing on your feed! And John Palethorpe messages from New Zealand: Blimey! Kids at the school I teach at in Auckland have slowly been learning about Leicester this season – we’ve gone from them pretending to be Rooney and Hazard to Jamie Vardy and Mahrez. Not seen a shirt yet, but it’s only a matter of time … I saw Wes Morgan play for Forest against Northampton in League One 10 years ago – if you’d told me then that he’d captain a Prem winning side, I’d have laughed. I’m still laughing now though. What a story. Nice one Claudio. 7.00am BST Dilly dong: the wisdom of Claudio Ranieri Courtesy of Press Association, here are the Leicester boss’s most … characterful quotes of the season. Somebody get this man on Twitter, sharpish. I told them, if you keep a clean sheet, I’ll buy pizza for everybody. I think they’re waiting for me to offer a hot dog too. On being told a Leicester butcher had created a sausage in his honour: I pay for pizza, you pay for the sausage. I am the sausageman. On his distinctive catchphrase: From the beginning when something was wrong I’ve been saying: ‘Dilly-ding, dilly-dong, wake up, wake up!’ So on Christmas day I bought for all the players and all the staff a little bell. It was just a joke. On Jamie Vardy: This is not a footballer. This is a fantastic horse. On LCFC and Tom Hanks: Why can’t we continue to run, run, run? We are like Forrest Gump. Leicester is Forrest Gump. I give you the headline there.” On Leicester’s run for the title: Now we go straight away to try to win the title. We are in the Champions League, dilly ding, dilly dong – come on. We are in the Champions League, it is fantastic, terrific. Well done to everybody.

Wang Song Ao Han, a 26-year-old from Inner Mongolia, became a Foxes fan back in 2014 when he was studying at the University of Leicester for a master’s degree in media and advertising. Wang was a regular at the King Power stadium and said Monday night’s victory had left him on the verge of tears. Wang Song Ao Han at the King Power stadium. Photograph: Wang Song Ao Han “I have no words to express how I am feeling. It’s probably one of the best feelings I have ever felt in my entire life,” said Wang who lives in Beijing but is originally from Tongliao, a city of about three million inhabitants towards China’s border with Mongolia and Russia. “I watched Leicester when they were virtually unheard of. Hardly any Chinese journalists knew about them. Even in UK, it isn’t a well-known city. It’s a very small,” Wang went on. “It is really hard to express the feeling of seeing a team go from being a complete nobody to being today’s Premier League champion.” Wang said he would organise a celebratory dinner in Beijing on Saturday night to watch Leicester’s last home game of the season, against Everton. “I am so excited. I hope the dream will last a long time. I can’t get enough of it,” he said. 6.14am BST I suspect that readers are now engaged in some concerted effort to get a name-check for every country in the globe on this blog. Undaunted by the strength of the Australian and Canadian contingents, you’ve sent messages from far and wide. From Honduras, Dominic Fleming writes: As an Everton fan since I was seven years old I’m so relieved I will be able to follow my team with no guilt next weekend. Watched the Tottenham game in Utila, Honduras, today and the place erupted when Hazard grabbed the equaliser. The mosquitos are being ignored as we currently toast the upset of all upsets. Ben Daggers emails from Japan: The Osaka branch of the Leicester City fan club (population: 3) had a delirious Monday night. With a 4am kickoff there were no bars showing the game – we had to settle for a flurry of mildly-panicked, expletive-filled first half of text messages, followed by a euphoric, expletive-filled second half … Finally got to sleep at 7am and will be spending today smiling. And from Iran, Hugo Corden-Lloyd sends this: Just woken up in Tehran to see that Leicester are the champions! Everywhere I’ve been in the city over the last month as soon as I tell people I’m English the response has been ‘Jamie Vardy, Khoob!’ Which means Jamie Vardie, good! Some things just seem to generate universal excitement, which is a great thing to see. Ruby Dean has had a late night/early start in Nigeria: Words can’t describe how ecstatic I am by 4am in the wee hours of the morning in Nigeria! … Hard work surely begets success! Congrats to the new kings! And Mark Hannant seems to be having a tough night in Saudi Arabia but we’re here to help: My wife and I and two small children are stuck in Jeddah airport for 12 hours en route from Mumbai to Manchester. ‘Happy Hammer’ all my life so fully understand the disappointments of supporting unfashionable clubs. The Guardian’s rolling coverage is making a rather grim night into something memorable. Thanks. 6.00am BST If you’re just joining us/waking up/hearing the word Leicester for the first time, welcome! And also, what kept you? Here’s a great explainer of why everyone is very excited about a team that many expected to be facing relegation but that is instead getting its hands on the Premier League trophy: Related: The Leicester Supremacy – a triumph that was never supposed to happen | Barney Ronay Updated at 6.20am BST 5.44am BST My colleague Oliver Holmes in Bangkok has been checking out Leicester City’s Thai Facebook page, where many are hoping the team’s success could be translated to Thai football. “Goosebumps! Cheering on Leicester City is like cheering on the Thai national team. Foreigners say it’s a Thai team – not Mr Vichai’s team,” writes user Imnanmanas. “Congrats from my heart … even though I’m a Liverpool fan … because you are team of Thais,” writes user Gaoten, who wears a Liverpool shirt in his Facebook profile. “This has created the new page of history in the world of football around the world that you don’t have to invest mega amounts of money by buying expensive players to be champions. It’s about thinking and the management within the club. Absolutely the best! I would love to see Thai players get experience and prove their place with Leicester City,” writes user Winyool Yasrakool. Updated at 5.46am BST 5.37am BST I have had lots of emails from readers in Canada, which is always a joy whatever the reason, but right now makes me wonder if there is a great undiscovered Leicester diaspora there. Francesco emails to say: I am a life-long Arsenal supporter (now living in Canada having left my home in Ireland a few years ago). I have to say I am delighted with Leicester winning the title. I was always very impressed with the way Ranieri conducted himself at all the clubs he managed and he deserves all the praise he is receiving at the moment … Many years ago he saved Parma football club (Parma is the place where I was born) from certain relegation when he took over the team mid-season, an incredible feat at the time. His tactical acumen came in very handy towards the end of the season when the team needed points desperately. Christine Welch is one of a number of readers who’ve contacted me today to say their fathers would have been celebrating the victory: WOW. This makes me feel so good. My Dad used to take me to Filbert Street in the early 50s, he was a number one fan, no way could they do any wrong, he always blamed the ref. After every season he would always say ONE DAY WE WILL. He used to drive me crazy but he never wavered, he would have loved this day. Gavin Wightman checks in from Belle River, Ontario: I have been a Leicester fan for over 30 years especially since my Dad used to take me to games as a teenager. Moved here in 2008 and haven’t seen another Leicester fan. My nine-year-old son wears his Leicester shirt to school with pride, with the other kids in ignorance in their Barcelona/Messi shirts – perhaps now they will realise the significance. What an awesome achievement! (Gavin, as you can see, you are definitely not Canada’s sole Leicester fan!) Nick Grayson, also from Ontario, shares this tale: My father was born in Leicester on Brandon Street in 1929, we emigrated to Canada in 1973 when I was 13 … He hated football though and thought it was a total waste of time, (at least that’ s what he told me). Of course I loved the game and can still name all of the player’s from Leicester’s FA Cup team … He died just shortly after they found King Richard’s body. On his own death bed we talked about everything Leicester, even down to the parking lot where they found him … His final comments went to football, something he never brought up first. He asked me how Leicester were doing and that he had seen them play many times as child. I wasn’t expecting this confession and that’s where his life ended, with him saying that King Richard might bring the city luck. I never thought of my dad as a prophet – smart, but not a prophet. Tonight though my dad, King Richard and Leicester are bending their elbows and toasting those who believe and the underdogs, the strength of teamwork over straight-up dollars and buying success. I love it and long may they run.

Obviously all workplaces and schools in Leicester are giving everyone the day off on Tuesday*. (*You might need to check this because I have just made it up and I’m not the mayor or anything like that.) Some of these supporters have missed their bedtime.

Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA 5.02am BST Maybe it’s the Schwarzer effect, but I’m hearing from plenty of Leicester fans in Australia today. Here are a couple: Jo Staniforth emails to say: I got up at 4am to watch the Chelsea game in Adelaide … I just can’t get my head around anything else at the moment. I rang my brother in the UK at the final whistle and all we could manage was ‘fucking hell!’ Kevin Wesson had a good start to the day too: In almost 40 years of following Leicester City, I have never even day-dreamed of this. Sure I have imagined us winning the FA Cup on a sunny day in May or even European success on a balmy night in foreign climes, but never the Premier League! Got up this morning just in time to see Eden Hazard score Chelsea’s second and decisive goal. My seven-year-old son insisted on calling Grandma in the UK to share (who lives in the same town as Jamie Vardy) to share the wonderful news! Although he couldn’t wear his Leicester kit to school I borrowed his scarf to fly from my car window on this morning commute. Just finalising the post Mother’s Day pass-out to be in the UK for the final game at Chelsea and the open-top bus parade! Updated at 5.04am BST 4.53am BST Will the Leicester City and Australia goalkeeper end his season with a winner’s medal? Leicester’s victory has lent some weight to the theory that Mark Schwarzer is a Premier League lucky charm. While the former Socceroo did not play a single league match for the Foxes this season, he became the first goalkeeper to be involved in back-to-back title victories with separate clubs. Mark Schwarzer playing for Leicester City against Aston Villa in the FA Cup fifth round. Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty Images Schwarzer, who was with Chelsea last season, does not meet the official criteria to qualify for a winner’s medal, which stipulate a player must have made at least five appearances to receive one. The veteran did not play a league match during Chelsea’s title run last year either, yet he still pocketed a medal after then-Blues manager Jose Mourinho decided to buy him a replica in recognition of his efforts from the bench. There has been no indication yet from the victorious Leicester camp as to whether Claudio Ranieri will follow suit this year and make Schwarzer the first player since Eric Cantona (Leeds United-Manchester United in 1992 and 1993) to win back-to-back top-flight titles with different clubs. Related: Mark Schwarzer: Leicester City's non-playing Premier League lucky charm Updated at 7.26am BST 4.43am BST Reader Andrew Marshall emails to suggest that my esteemed Guardian football colleague Daniel Taylor deserves to lose extra points for his “Most excited about” prediction (made in August 2015). What do we think? Most excited about: I Believe in Miracles, the Jonny Owen documentary-film about Nottingham Forest, 1975-80, and the kind of implausible success story that could never happen again. In case anyone thinks I am enjoying this period of gloating at my colleagues: a) yes, yes I am, rather; and b) I’d never have predicted a Leicester City win either, so I am an enormous hypocrite. 4.26am BST Even in China football fans are celebrating Leicester’s victory, which a report by state broadcaster CCTV described as being less likely than finding the Loch Ness monster or discovering that Elvis was alive. One message left on the club’s official Weibo account this morning reads: “I am so happy to witness Leicester’s fairy tale! Thanks Leicester City for showing me how charming football can be again! It is so great for people who have dreams!” \"The cheering was loud enough to wake even King Richard III!\" - China's official news agency on @LCFC triumph https://t.co/cShAYq3J4e — Tom Phillips (@tomphillipsin) May 3, 2016 4.18am BST I’m sure my UK sports colleagues will take this in the spirit it’s intended (mild-ribbing-verging-on-outright-mockery), but given it’s 4.15am there and they’ll be asleep, let’s go for it. Here are their predictions for the 2016 EPL, made at the start of the season: Related: Premier League 2015-16: Guardian football writers’ season predictions I count 10 votes in there for Leicester to be among the teams relegated. Zero for title winners. And a couple of comments that I’m sure their originators have already eaten with a side helping of humble pie: Relegated: Watford and Norwich, just because they go up and they go down. And probably Leicester too. No Nigel, no party. How Claudio Ranieri continues to land good jobs is a mystery. Relegated: Leicester, Sunderland and Norwich. I fear that Claudio Ranieri will struggle at Leicester. Relegated: Watford, Leicester and Newcastle all for the same reason: the manager. I’m going to give Louise Taylor a bonus point for caveating her expectation that Leicester would find themselves in the relegation zone: … but Claudio Ranieri may just exceed expectations. Still, wouldn’t it be boring if football followed all the predictions? And most of them were backing Leicester by February: Related: Who will win the Premier League title? Guardian writers pick their winners 4.04am BST More reader emails! This is the best bit of my job today, I’ll be honest. Rob Newton messages to say: Two weeks ago I was in Hsi Paw, a small town in Shan state, Myanmar. Hsi Paw is mostly notable for its tea, its trekking, and the occasional flare-up of the decades-old conflict between Shan rebels and the Myanmar army. I walked into a pancake shop, where they were playing the premier league. The owner asked where I was from. I said Leicestershire. And he proudly declared his allegiance to Leicester City. Free pancakes in Hsi Paw tonight! Chilima Chola says hi from Lusaka, Zambia: Leicester’s story is our story. Everyday we get beaten down and slammed to the ground by life and our realities. But today, Leicester showed me and Zambia that no matter what the odds are in life, hard work and persistence is all you need to succeed in life. Joe Nhodza, from Zimbabwe, is warming to the fairytale theme: I’m a Man U fan but for some reason I’m up at 4.30am in this part of the world called Zimbabwe. And I’m finding it rather impossible not to be happy for Leicester. I feel Leicester’s story proves just how much everyone loves a good fairytale ending. I could compare Leicester’s triumph to that moment when Anna managed to thaw queen Elsa’s frozen heart, by getting her to believe in love again: marvellous! Well done Leicester for being our modern-day fairytale. Guru Singh is setting Leicester’s sights even higher: I am at the moment in Boston, USA. As a lifelong Nottingham Forest fan I can applause Leicester’s fantastic achievement having lived through similar emotions many times with Forest. Well done The Foxes! Now go and win the European Cup! 3.53am BST It’s a happy morning in Bangkok, Oliver Holmes reports: The Spurs match was at 2am, so only the most dedicated fans in Thailand watched, but many are waking up to the news now. Many supporters here were hoping that Leicester would win it at the weekend in the game against Manchester United, which was at 8pm. I was at King Power HQ, a huge duty-free outlet in central Bangkok, that night speaking to fans about why they loved Leicester. The club’s owner, billionaire Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, had treated hundreds to free beer, fresh prawns and a huge screen under the palm trees. Leicester City fans gathered at King Power hotel in Bangkok to watch the game between Manchester United and Leicester City at Old Trafford. Photograph: Borja Sanchez Trillo/Getty Images One fan, Akapong Nutthawute, said he had won a competition on Leicester City’s Thai Facebook page to get a seat at the showing. He has been watching English football since his childhood, mainly because that was the only choice. “Twenty or 30 years ago the only league that we could watch in Thailand was British. The other leagues weren’t on television, so Thais support British teams,” said the 37-year-old engineer from the country’s north. He said that he still has love for Liverpool, the team his parents have supported for decades, saying that Leicester was an “alternate team”. “This team have the team work. They played together last year and each player knows the skills of the other,” he said. His friend, the other lucky draw winner, nodded his head in approval. 3.39am BST The second biggest question of the day (after Where is Claudio Ranieri?) is – for those newer to LCFC’s meteoric rise – the challenge of pronouncing Leicester. Google’s suggested search reveals that it has certainly had a few queries (seriously, though, who doesn’t know how to pronounce “Lego”?): US broadcaster NBC came prepared: a napkin made by US television network (and EPL broadcast rights-holder) NBC two years ago https://t.co/nTgaQ40MOE pic.twitter.com/fVB6QU9uYK — Tiger Webb (@tfswebb) May 2, 2016 3.29am BST Oliver Holmes reports from Bangkok that many supporters on Leicester City’s Thai Facebook page, which has nearly 600,000 members, are sharing photos of themselves holding up talismanic cloths, which are blessed by Buddhist monks. Thai Buddhist monk Phra Prommangkalachan next to the ‘sacred holy unbeatable’ Leicester City fabric and talisman at Wat Traimit temple, also known as Golden Buddha temple, in Bangkok.

The text of the tattoos reads: “Brave and unyielding over any team. If you have this, your fortune will send you to be champions.” Updated at 3.30am BST 3.15am BST More emails from fans all over the globe, and this first one, from Riley Strother, might win today’s prize for the most farflung location: I’m alone at the Race Rocks lighthouse, which is situated on a tiny island on the west coast of British Columbia, Canada, and I am ecstatic about Leicester becoming champions! I’m a Newcastle fan, but since the start of the season I have been pulling for Leicester to pull off this incredible upset, and for the last few months I’ve been following every game out here on this rock. Even though there are only seals and sea lions to confirm it, I am indeed dancing for joy! Riley, please ask a marine mammal to take a photo to verify your claim. Diego García pops up with a message: Writing from the Dominican Republic just to let you know Leicester’s story and success were followed and celebrated here too. This is what makes sports so beautiful. Sveinn Sigþórsson says hello from Iceland: Earlier this evening I was at a game between KR Reykjavik and Vikingur Reykjavik in the Icelandic Premier League. The stadium announcer usually announces other goals around the Icelandic league and then the MOTM, but I’ve never heard him comment on matches abroad. Tonight, he excitedly announced “Chelsea and Tottenham have drawn 2-2, Leicester are champions!”, which drew wild celebrations from the crowd all around the stadium. As the match finished with a 0-0 scoreline that was just as boring as it sounds, this provided the only excitement of the game. And a magnanimous email from Jarrod Wilkinson-Smith, self-styled “Spurs fan in NZ”: So happy for Leicester – the table doesn’t lie. Also really happy Spurs are going to Champs League again – if we get one more star player and don’t lose the main guys we will be a real force for the next decade. Thanks to all of you who are emailing me. I’m reading them all and will feature as many of them as I can on here. 2.54am BST Eleanor Ainge Roy sends this jolly dispatch from New Zealand: At the bottom of the world, in Dunedin, Hayley Stirling spent Tuesday morning glued to her phone. Her internet was out, but her friend Maria in Yorkshire texted her minute-by-minute updates of the match, and she was “on tenterhooks” waiting to hear if Leicester City would prevail. [3/5 8:09 AM] Hayley: Fuck it, spurs are up by 2... damn. [3/5 8:11 AM] Maria: I know!!! I’m fuming. Chelsea better score 2 and quick! [3/5 8:18 AM] Maria: 2-1!!! Game on!

A draw is all they need!!! Come on!! [3/5 8:56 AM] Maria: Yes Leicester!!!! Amazing! [3/5 9:04 AM] Hayley: Oh my god!!!!!!!! Waaaaahhhhhoooooooo!!!! Foxes foxes foxes foxes!!!! Ranieri for president! [3/5 9:12 AM] Maria: Haha I’d vote Ranieri for President. “When I got into work, we didn’t say anything at all, we all just started high-fiving and hugging each other,” said Stirling, who is the women’s football development officer for Football South. “Usually we’ve all supported the big teams, but this season all of us have gone for Leicester. I think it’s a timeless thing anyone can relate to – we all want the underdog to have a chance for success, in sport and life.” Today Stirling and her colleagues have been too excited to concentrate on work, and have instead spent hours outside in the autumn sunshine, kicking a football back and forth “pretending we’re Jamie Vardy”. “We’ll go out tonight for a couple of drinks. We all can’t stop smiling. It’s really a great day here.” Updated at 3.10am BST 2.42am BST People “take to Twitter” for anything these days, I know, but UK football fans really did hit those 140 characters last night: Wow. Leicester winning the league triggered an 86% increase in normal Twitter activity in the UK...#havingaparty pic.twitter.com/vGTmtqwq2E — Twitter UK (@TwitterUK) May 2, 2016 Here’s the Twitter moment – you know, that bit at the bottom of the app that you never click on – on Leicester’s victory: 2.31am BST The big question now is: where is Claudio Ranieri? Press Association reports that his “whereabouts during the evening remain unknown”: He said after Monday’s 1-1 draw at Manchester United he would be heading back to Italy to fulfil a lunch date with his 96-year-old mother and as such would be flying to England when the full-time whistle was blown. Footage showed him leaving Rome Ciampino airport ahead of schedule, so it is likely he was able to see his old club do him the greatest of favours. Earlier, Ranieri told reporters: I’m so proud. I’m happy for my players, for the chairman, for the staff at Leicester City, all our fans and the Leicester community. It’s an amazing feeling and I’m so happy for everyone. I never expected this when I arrived. I’m a pragmatic man, I just wanted to win match after match and help my players to improve week after week. Never did I think too much about where it would take us. The players have been fantastic. Their focus, their determination, their spirit has made this possible. Every game they fight for each other and I love to see this in my players. They deserve to be champions. A Chelsea supporter-turned-Claudio Ranieri fan.

The broadcaster singled out Shinji Okazaki for praise. “He worked tirelessly in front of the goal, and was devoted to protecting his defence,” NHK wrote. “Goals such as his exquisite overhead kick in March helped Leicester keep up a momentum they never lost.” Shinji Okazaki: helping to make Leicester City big in Japan.

You know, the usual. And then to see them keep defying the odds, game after game, I started to follow again. Sometime around Christmas I decided Leicester we’re going to do it. “I have a warm glow,” Sherriff added. “I’d say smugness, but we don’t do smug in Leicester. Just a little sad to be so far from home on a day like this. Well, there hasn’t been a day like this for Leicester. Ever.” Many Japanese football fans, loyal to other teams, tweeted their congratulations. “You do not have to be a fan of Leicester to be crying with joy today,” wrote @hargreeeeaves. レスターファンじゃなくても嬉しいし涙出てくるね\uD83D\uDE02\uD83D\uDE02\uD83D\uDE02 — はーぐさん (@hargreeeeaves) May 3, 2016 The unofficial Leicester supporters club in Japan offered thanks for messages from all over the world. “We live Japan but, our hearts are always together!!!,” the account tweeted.

Mike Brooks messages from Chicago: I’m a lifelong Palace fan but (or perhaps and) this is by far the greatest footballing moment I have experienced. In the ruins of the oligarchical tyranny of the ‘big four’, I think the smoke of tribalism is clearing and we’re all remembering that, perhaps first and foremost, we’re fans of football. In fact, I’m feeling so sentimental I’m putting off the first beer for fear of tears! Rashed, from Dhaka,Bangladesh, is ahead of you, Mike: I’m crying continuously after reading this news as Leicester wins the Premiership title. I think they are also win Champions League in next season. After 20 round I thought Leicester can get highest 10th position but it was completely wrong … I think now if it is possible that Leicester’s title then I can do everything in my life. But Michael Clifton in Auckland, New Zealand, is wondering what he’ll do now with his Monday mornings: With the last 5 Leicester games played Sunday UK time this translated to Monday morning NZ time, giving me a shot of adrenaline to kick start my week.

We moved to Australia over 30 years ago, and he has religiously followed his team, every game, every season. Today, he is the happiest man in the world with his heart bursting with pride. My Dad and my sister have got their flights booked and tickets to see Leicester’s last game, they fly out next Sunday. My Dad, God love him, will cry his eyes out when he sees them with that trophy. He never ever believed that this would happen in his lifetime, if ever at all. What a great day! Have a fantastic trip, Joanna’s dad! Meanwhile, Niall Curran emails from South Korea to switch allegiances: Can I become a Leicester fan now? I was hoping they’d beat the team I ostensibly support – Man Utd.

Sadly, Australia’s Channel Nine didn’t appear to be fully across the details. Full marks for effort, though. 1.07am BST My colleague Claire Phipps will take over this liveblog now for more reaction from around the world to Leicester’s incredible title win. Thanks for reading so far. Send her your messages from wherever you are in the world, particularly if you’re a Leicester fan in a far flung place: claire.phipps@theguardian.com 12.55am BST It’s probably not the main focus, given Leicester’s remarkable title triumph, but here are five talking points from a fullblooded, firecracker of a match at Stamford Bridge - the result of which led to Leicester winning the Premier League. Related: Chelsea 2-2 Tottenham: five talking points from Stamford Bridge as Leicester win title | James Riach 12.49am BST Barney Ronay’s excellent piece on Leicester’s title - a triumph that was never supposed to happen - is here. The bald facts of the Leicester Supremacy are brilliantly stark. This is a club whose previous highest league position was a runners-up spot in 1929, who have been relegated or promoted 22 times in all. Too small to stay up, too big to stay down, Leicester are instead the ultimate ballcock team, clunking up and down between the divisions with reassuring regularity, an inbetweener club in a city on the way to somewhere else. Related: The Leicester Supremacy – a triumph that was never supposed to happen | Barney Ronay Updated at 1.03am BST 12.43am BST For a timeline on quite how far Leicester have come in the past five years, you could do worse than this (which was prepared for Sunday, when Leicester could have won the title against Manchester United but drew 1-1). Related: How Leicester City’s five-year fairytale unfolded 12.40am BST Stuart James, our Midlands football correspondent, has followed Leicester all season long. He reports on the Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri’s reaction to a fairytale title victory. Claudio Ranieri has described winning the Premier League title as an “amazing feeling” and paid tribute to his Leicester City players for completing one of the most remarkable stories in the history of English football. The Leicester manager, who flew back to England on Monday night after having lunch in Italy with his 96-year-old mother, Renata, admitted his players had surpassed all expectations and praised them for their spirit and determination. Read the full story here: Related: Proud Claudio Ranieri says Leicester players deserve to be champions 12.37am BST It got pretty tasty at the end of the Chelsea v Tottenham match, with players from both sides involved in ugly scenes as they left the pitch (and, to be honest, throughout the match). Chelsea’s 2-2 draw with Spurs handed the title to Leicester and deprived Tottenham of the chance to be named champions. The Tottenham manager Mauricio Pohettino refused to criticise his players and had this to say about it: It was a derby, we were fighting to win the title and Chelsea were fighting to try and win. We were all involved. When you play for the title and play a big team like Chelsea, they want to win. It was normal emotion, fighting on the pitch is not a good example, for both teams. The Chelsea interim manager Guus Hiddink said this: I took Fàbregas, I tried to get him down [the tunnel], because there were some words in Spanish and I understand Spanish. Threatening a bit. There became more people involved and we shuffled around. James Riach has filed this story: Related: Mauricio Pochettino: “It was a derby and we were fighting” 12.33am BST A tweet from the deputy editor of our US sports desk, Bryan Armen Graham that goes some way to summing up what Leicester have achieved: Here's what the English Premier League table looked like 381 days ago. pic.twitter.com/1HxgjFOKZg — Bryan Armen Graham (@BryanAGraham) May 2, 2016 12.27am BST Leicester City’s striker, Jamie Vardy, recently crowned the Football Writers’ player of the year has said of the title win: “It’s an unbelievable feeling I’ve never known anything like it. We were scrapping to stay in the league last season and on Saturday we’ll be lifting the trophy. That gives you an idea of how much hard work has gone into this season from every single player and member of staff. “It’s the biggest achievement in the history of a great club and we all feel privileged to be part of it. It’s even more special to have done it with these lads. Every minute of hard work we’ve put in on the training pitch has been worth it for this moment.” The midfielder Andy King, who has now won League One, Championship and Premier League titles with Leicester City said: “I thought I’d seen everything with this club, but I never thought I’d see this. It’s difficult to put into words. The players deserve it, the gaffer and the staff deserve it, and the fans deserve it. It’s been an unbelievable season. “The story of where this team has come from to get to this point has been all over the world recently and I think the lads deserve great credit for the way they’ve taken it in their stride, stayed focused and kept delivering results - especially with a great side like Spurs chasing us so hard. “We’ve been so consistent and just determined not to let the opportunity pass us by. We deserve this.” 12.17am BST Amid Leicester celebrations, it is easy to forget that Tottenham blew their chance of winning a first title since 1961. Simon Burnton was at Stamford Bridge, and reports on how they lost their chance to do it again tonight - and lost all control while they were at it. It was a hell of a match in west London on Monday evening - a snarling, furious, wildly attacking, brilliant game of football. Well, you can’t say they didn’t go down fighting. It took until the final half-hour for Tottenham Hotspur’s title challenge to finally, definitively unravel, but from the seventh minute, when Mousa Dembélé initiated a snarling squabble with Mikel John Obi, to the seventh minute of stoppage time, when the final whistle blew and players and managers brawled on their way down the tunnel, this was a display full more of malice than of merit. Related: Tottenham lose title hopes and all control in draw with Chelsea 12.10am BST Owen Gibson has written a detailed profile of the Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri. As well as being a master tactician Ranieri has also perfectly judged the psychology. He kept things simple, lifting the pressure from his side and focusing relentlessly on the next game, admitting only recently that the title was in sight with his “Dilly-ding, dilly-dong” rallying cry. In the age of the individual’s veneration in football Ranieri, like Diego Simeone at Atlético Madrid, has made teamwork fashionable again. And, paradoxically, in the process he has made unlikely stars of Vardy and Mahrez.

With Spurs 0-2 up I was pretty convinced we’d have to wait until next week. I logged onto the plane’s wi-fi and saw we’d won, I shed a tear and now I think I’m the happiest man at 30,000ft anywhere in the world. Let’s hope we can hang onto our players for next year. What a team.” Tony O’Brien in New Zealand: “I’ve just bought the entire company morning tea, tonight at a Trigg point overlooking the town a Leicester City flag will be flying.” John Perry in Nicaragua: “Here in rural Nicaragua I’ve been watching the Chelsea game with my wife Abi and sharing tears of joy and sadness. I’ve supported Leicester City for over 30 years, mainly because my late son Joss dragged me to the games when he was about 10 years old. It’s fantastic to see a team that you’ve watched being relegated to League One having such an amazing season. What a team, what a manager, what a club, what a city!” 11.55pm BST Claudio Ranieri has released a statement, via Leicester City: “I’m so proud. I’m happy for my players, for the chairman, for the staff at Leicester City, all our fans and the Leicester community. It’s an amazing feeling and I’m so happy for everyone. “I never expected this when I arrived. I’m a pragmatic man, I just wanted to win match after match and help my players to improve week after week. Never did I think too much about where it would take us. “The players have been fantastic. Their focus, their determination, their spirit has made this possible. Every game they fight for each other and I love to see this in my players. They deserve to be champions.” 11.48pm BST Gary Lineker, the former Leicester City striker and Match of the Day presenter, has spoken to Radio 5 Live: “It’s extraordinary. Sat watching with three of my boys. Couple of Leicester fans they are. It was just so emotional, so incredible. “It looked like it was going to go to next Saturday. Then that extraordinary second half. I just can’t get my head round it. “I just think it’s generally the biggest sporting shock. I can’t think of anything that surpasses it. When it’s your own team it’s too extraordinary. Too difficult to put over in words. “To be honest I got a bit emotional at the end of the game. I just couldn’t hold it back. It was quite hard to breathe the last few minutes to be honest. “I’ve followed them since I was a little kid. I was a season-ticket holder until I was seven years old. I saw them in a cup final - lose - that was the closest we ever got to big glory. Won the league cup a couple of times but this is just something else. This is actually impossible. “There were no odds that I would have taken at the start of the season. No odds. You could have given me 10 million to one and I’d have said ‘Nah, it’s a waste of a quid’. “It’s extraordinary. I’m from there and I went to play for them for a couple of years. I even kind of part owned them for a while when they were in trouble. To see where they are now and to enjoy this moment especially with my family, it’s incredible.” 11.45pm BST Another poem, this one from Harley Quinn: The warning signs were showing, T’was April and snowing, The hunt was still going, Their horns were still blowing, ‘Cause the Foxes were still running free, They raced blinding bright through the Palace of Light, Drew the Red Devils well on a cold day in hell, Though Spurs dig deep in and Lions chase, neither win, So the Foxes are still running free, We know you don’t believe us, We know you don’t believe us, We know you don’t believe us but… THEY WENT AND RAN THE LEAGUE!!! 11.44pm BST Lots of people are getting in touch from New Zealand to tell Dahya and Suresh Rama (see earlier) that there are plenty in the country who not only care, but are delighted by Leicester City’s win. “Tell Dahya and Suresh Rama that there are people in NZ who care - a lot more younger people than their generation, but a lot of us love football and are loving this fairy-tale,’ emails Andrew Bunyan. “Their’s is a fantastic story to find amidst Leicester’s triumph” 11.40pm BST A report on Leicester’s other big title winner tonight, Mark Selby, can be found here Related: Mark Selby clinches second world title with 18-14 win over Ding Junhui 11.37pm BST Ladrokes says they will never again offer odds of 5,000/1 for an underdog after paying out on incredible Leicester’s title win. Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes said: “We may be paying out record sums to Leicester backers but we do so with a smile and we have to applaud the handful of fans who took the mammoth odds at the start of the season. “The days of 5000/1 are over. We’ll never be so generous with odds again for an underdog.” One punter, Karishma Kapoor, a student and lifelong Leicester fan, won £10,000 while the company also paid out £100,000 (from a £20 stake), £73,500 (from £10 each way) Kapoor said: “I’m just ecstatic, not just due to the bet but for the team and the entire city. I’m on cloud nine as a Leicester fan as it is and the bet is the icing on the cake.

James Riach reports: Claudio Ranieri made an emotional phone call to Guus Hiddink to thank Chelsea for handing Leicester City the title, after a tumultuous night when the Italian’s name was sung loud at Stamford Bridge. Ranieri, who managed Chelsea before Jose Mourinho was first appointed manager in 2004, telephoned Hiddink after flying back from Italy where he had been lunching with his 96-year-old mother. Tempers flared at the final whistle as Tottenham and Chelsea players and staff became embroiled in a mass brawl by the tunnel, but after Eden Hazard’s equaliser Ranieri’s name was sung by the delighted Chelsea fans who were desperate to end Spurs’ title hopes. Hiddink said: “Just after the final whistle, a few minutes after the judo, I got a call from Ranieri, he thanked us especially for what we did in the second half and I congratulated him for being champions. They deserved it, it may be a bit of a shock for the established clubs that they did so well. They didn’t implode, there was no tension when they started smelling the title. “I didn’t see any tears because it was not a Facetime conversation but his voice was trembling a bit.

Here’s an email from two fans, Dahya and Suresh Rama, who write that they are Indian and now live in New Zealand. “My brother and I have been loyal Leicester City supporters since 1965 , when we first came from Kenya. Our first home was at 68 Walnut Street, one street from Filbert Street. We started watching and following City since then. “I went to Wembley to watch the FA Cup match against Manchester City, we lost, most disappointing. We even had an off licence shop on Filbert Street for a couple of years. “We moved to New Zealand in 1977, soccer was not big here then however we have stuck to our team, through thick and thin, never supported any other major teams and today, it’s our turn to be in the sunshine . “I went to Moat Boys school in Leicester, City of Leicester Boys and I played soccer with Carl Jayes, Leicester reserve goalkeeper. I qualified as a pharmacist, worked in Leicester for six months, moved to London for two years and moved to New Zealand in 1977. I have been here since then. “We loved our beloved Leicester. Players like Jackie Sinclair, Peter Rodgers, Len Glover, Gordon Banks ,Derek Dougan, Peter Shilton heroes of our days . “Would love to be with the boys and fans to celebrate this amazing mile stone after 123 years, would love The Guardian to shout us trip back home? Now we can go to our graves happy and meet our maker to talk to him about it. A great Leicester City team, all credit to the manager, players and fans. May we have many more wins and we do well in Europe. I can’t wipe the smile off my face, no one in NZ cares.” 11.19pm BST Worth a punt? Bet365 said it was now pricing Leicester at 100/1 to win the Champions League, report Press Association. Spokesman Steve Freeth said: “The dream has become reality and Leicester City will be the toast of a number of punters after pulling off the biggest sports betting shock of all-time - to the tune of over 3m in our case.” Leicester’s win has cost the bookies William Hill £2.2m, their worst individual day in two decades. “Leicester’s 5,000/1 victory has smashed all bookmaking records and in the process cost us a £2.2m loss - our worst individual day’s result on a single sport since Frankie Dettori rode all seven winners at Ascot in September 1996 and cost us over £8m and the industry 50m.” said William Hill’s spokesman Graham Sharpe. William Hill are pricing Leicester at 25/1 for the title next season and at 16/1 to go down. The bookmaker added that its largest bet on Leicester was £20 at 5,000/1 and the smallest 5p at the same price. 11.15pm BST The Leicester City captain, Wes Morgan, has spoken about winning the Premier League title: It’s the best feeling of my career and I couldn’t be prouder that it’s as part of this team. Everyone’s worked so hard for this, nobody believed we could do it, but here we are, Premier League champions and deservedly so. “I’ve never known a spirit like the one between these boys, we’re like brothers. People saw it last season when everyone expected us to be relegated, but we fought back to prove people wrong. This season’s been a continuation of that. We’ve built on the momentum, but I don’t think anyone believed it would come to this. 11.13pm BST The Chelsea captain John Terry has been talking to Sky Sports. Congratulations to Leicester because they have been superb this year. The rivalry with Tottenham means a lot but that still hurts us tonight losing the league title after the way we won it last year. “It hurts passing the Premier League title to Leicester but credit to them, they’ve been superb. We’ve not been good enough but we’ll be back next year. “Claudio Ranieri is different class and I’m pleased for him 100%. I spoke to him pre-season and wished him well and to do what they’ve done this season has been unbelievable and given hope to the smaller sides. “Credit to Claudio because he’s a great manager and a great person. Congratulations to Leicester and all their players because all season long everyone has been saying they’d lose the next one, they’ll lose the next one but they never did and they’ve kept churning out results.” 11.12pm BST Ben Quinn is the Guardian’s man in Leicester. He has been talking to the city’s mayor As car horns hooted outside his window, Leicester’s mayor, Peter Sousby, told the Guardian “We thought it couldn’t get any better 12 months ago when the eyes of the world were on us as we reinterred the bones of Richard III, but this is even better.” “We are very proud of what is probably the most diverse city in Europe and in fact many people see the team as a metaphor because it shows what you can really achieve when you bring a diverse group of people together,” he said. He added that the official celebrations will take place after the end of the season “although we will have two weeks of parties before then of course.” 11.08pm BST Pictures are filtering in from Jamie Vardy’s house, where the Leicester side gathered to watch the Chelsea v Tottenham draw which secured the club their first Premier League title.

Boro won 3-2, Bernie’s bum was duly aired. 10.53pm BST More on the sad news that bookies are taking a hammering. Here’s PA’s take: Bookmakers were left counting the cost of Leicester’s Premier League title on Monday night. City, 5,000-1 outsiders at the start of the season, claimed the crown on Monday night as rivals Tottenham failed to win at Chelsea. Stories have slowly emerged of those once optimistic punters who put the odd pound on their side to win the Premier League, in nothing but hope. And now, that hope is returning riches. Sky Bet said it had paid out a record £4.6m to gamblers, saying it was an industry loser with 128 people backing City at the longest price. Sky Bet’s Sandro Di Michele said: “The unthinkable has become reality and we’re facing a paying out the sort of liability that you joke about at the start of the season. “We’re now bracing ourselves for more punters looking to get on long-price outright odds, but Leicester certainly won’t be 5,000/1 next season!” Updated at 11.05pm BST 10.51pm BST Here is the latest from the pubs of Leicester: Related: Leicester fans celebrate football's unlikeliest win 10.50pm BST The Kasabian guitarist and Leicester City fan Serge Pizzorno is delighted: There have been so many great moments.

Photograph: @FuchsOfficial/Twitter Updated at 10.42pm BST 10.13pm BST It’s very hard to think of another story in football to compete with this. Perhaps Greece winning Euro 2004 (read about that here). But a cup competition is always primed for an upset. A league? Never.

Written off as relegation candidates at the start of the season, when the bookmakers made Leicester 5,000-1 outsiders to be crowned champions, they secured the first top-flight title in the club’s history after Tottenham were unable to beat Chelsea on Monday night. Related: Leicester City win the Premier League title after fairytale season 10.05pm BST Barney Ronay has written about Leicester’s sensational title win: Do not adjust your reality: this really is happening. For the last three months Leicester City’s gloriously bold progress towards a first English top-flight title has unfurled like a slow breaking wave. A draw against Manchester United on Sunday afternoon left Claudio Ranieri’s collection of off-cuts and rising talents a step closer. Tottenham’s failure to beat Chelsea on Monday night was the final nudge. The wave has finally broken on a Premier League title some are already calling the most unlikely sporting victory of all time.

Perhaps this is the scene playing out in mid-air somewhere as he flies back from taking his 96-year-old mother out to lunch in Italy \"This is your captain speaking....we're currently flying at 30,000 feet. Oh, and Claudio, you are the champion\" — Sid Lowe (@sidlowe) May 2, 2016 10.02pm BST Here is our first take on the news of Leicester’s incredible title win, courtesy of Chelsea’s draw with Tottenham: Related: Leicester City win the Premier League title after fairytale season 10.01pm BST There is bedlam in Leicester, absolute bedlam. Here is Iman Amrani’s latest video. Look at those scenes! 10.00pm BST What an incredible game of football that was, a fitting finale to the incredible story of Leicester City’s season. Played at breakneck speed, full to bursting with passion. The goals were wonderful - particularly Hazard’s - the attitude was confrontational, and the crowd were sensational. Couldn’t have asked for a better game to decide the title - except, of course, for Leicester City being in it. Updated at 10.19pm BST 9.58pm BST Tottenham’s players look sick. Their manager looks ashen. There are players in each others’ faces, it’s getting ugly on the pitch at Chelsea. Michel Vorm, the reserve Spurs keeper, is at the heart of it. This is a melee. But in Leicester, there are wild celebrations. More clashes as the players head towards the tunnel. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters Updated at 10.06pm BST 9.55pm BST LEICESTER CITY ARE CHAMPIONS The referee blows the whistle. It’s the greatest fairytale in Premier League history. In football history! Dejected Spurs players walk of the pitch at the end of the game. Photograph: Tottenham Hotspur/Getty Images Updated at 10.07pm BST 9.55pm BST 90min+6: How are there still 11 players on each side? 9.54pm BST 90 min+6: Lamela attempts to build an attack, but Chelsea nick the ball. Dier reacts by absolutely clattering Fabregas. Up the other end, Mason assaults Hazard. Tottenham have lost their heads. Yellow for Mason. 9.53pm BST 90 min+4: Willian races forward across the centre circle and is chopped down by a frustrated Harry Kane. It leads to another big row in the centre of the pitch, all the players getting involved. As it stands Leicester are winning the title. 9.52pm BST 90 min +3: Hazard, in acres of space charges forward. He aims a wicked shot at goal from distance but hits Oscar on the back of the head. Spurs goal kick. 9.51pm BST 90min+3: A full blooded challenge on Vertonghen puts sufficient pressure on the defender for him to put the ball straight into touch when looking for a team-mate. 9.50pm BST 90 min +2: There is a lot of messing about and not very much football going on at the moment. Could well get more than six minutes extra time. Another scuffle breaks out. Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images Updated at 10.04pm BST 9.50pm BST 90 min +1: Chelsea’s fans are just chanting “Leicester! Leicester!” 9.49pm BST 90min +1: Chadli is brought on for Spurs, he replaces Alderweireld, injured after that tangle with Costa. 9.49pm BST 90 min: Diego Costa wins a corner after chasing down a lost cause and putting in a sensational tackle on Alderweireld. THe referee neglects to give it though. Six minutes added time. 9.47pm BST 88 min: Fabregas takes it, but it is a poor ball in - Willian can do little with it. Chelsea fans are singing ‘Over Land And Sea’, their chant that makes fond reference to Leicester. 9.46pm BST 88 min: Kyle Walker is on the touchlines, wiping blood from his face. John Terry, meanwhile, has been booked for his reaction to the foul on Hazard. Chelsea line up a free kick 40 yards out. 9.46pm BST 87 min: Tottenham have lost it: Dier absolutely clatters Hazard, a furious tackle. He gets a yellow but Chelsea’s players have once again surrounded the referee. This is a sensational game of football. Eric Dier takes out Eden Hazard. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters Updated at 9.59pm BST 9.45pm BST 86 min: Clattenburg tells the players to get on with it. 9.44pm BST 86 min: The game has flared up again, Fabregas insisting that Lamela stamped on his hand, I think. THe players are in a huddle, rowing furiously. Clattenburg is keeping his counsel for now but Lamela is on a yellow. 9.43pm BST 85 min: As it stands Leicester are champions. Leicester City fans celebrate. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters Updated at 9.54pm BST 9.42pm BST 84 min: What an impact he has had since coming on. He runs up the left, finds Costa - who is incredibly strong to hold challenges - then finds Hazard again, who curls an immaculate finish into the top corner. What a goal! This incredible game entirely deserves that sort of quality. Dejected Spurs players react after conceding the second. Photograph: Ian Walton/Getty Images Updated at 9.57pm BST 9.41pm BST GOAL! GOAL!! GOAL!!! Chelsea 2-2 Tottenham (Hazard, 82) Eden Hazardddddddd!!!!!! Eden Hazard scores a sublime second goal. Photograph: John Sibley/Reuters Updated at 9.47pm BST 9.40pm BST 81 min: And a minute later, Chelsea rampage forward on the attack. Diego Costa not able to get a proper shot away. Danny Rose has gone down injured and Ben Davies will replace him. Pochettino attempts to tell his players to calm down, but he does on his knees and pounding the pitch which sends a somewhat mixed signal. 9.38pm BST 78 min: Danny Rose rakes a ball from the centre of the pitch, straight through the Chelsea defence and into the box. He’s looking for Walker - left back to right back high up the pitch - but Willian (a wing) is back to deal with it. Mad stuff from a breakneck game. 9.37pm BST 78 min: Hazard diddles about with the ball up the Chelsea left. He is patient, waiting for an opening, but can’t find it. He passes to Mikel, who is not patient and lumps a woeful ball straight into the box which Lloris catches easily. 9.35pm BST 77 min: A moment after that fluffed chance, Eriksen shot but a brilliant block by Ivanovic denied him. Matic is coming off, Oscar coming on for Chelsea. An attacking change from Hiddink. 9.34pm BST 76 min: How does Mason not score? Walker, so threatening up the right, finds Mason on the edge of the box. Cahill had been dragged out of position by Kane’s run and so Mason had the entire goal to aim at. He fluffs his lines though. Poor. 9.33pm BST 74 min: Spurs have got Chelsea pegged back now, the home side’s revival after their goal flagging. The heat’s gone out of the match once more, which will suit Tottenham. Having said that, Hazard and Costa’s neat interplay nearly sends the Belgian into the box. It wakes Chelsea up and Willian jinks through the box, finds Hazard, who fizzes a low cross across the goal - a boot attempts to make contact but can’t connect. Walker clears for a corner, which Chelsea waste. Eden Hazard is fouled by Christian Eriksen. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian Updated at 9.35pm BST 9.30pm BST 72 min: Ivanovic earns himself a yellow for an oafish challenge on, I think, Lamela. Free kick to Spurs 10 yards from the corner of the box. The ball in is good, but there are no Spur players to meet it. Azpilicueta heads it out for a corner. Eventually, Spurs win another corner from it. Iman Amrani has the reaction in Leicester to Cahill’s goal: Updated at 9.31pm BST 9.28pm BST 69 min: Kane, battling hard, edges backwards into the Chelsea box but is met with two Chelsea defenders who clear (with a high boot). It’s worth saying that Chelsea’s defender have been all over Kane, but he has yet to react with anything more than a wry smile. Eriksen is booked, Spurs’s fifth of the night. Harry Kane goes to ground after being challenged by John Terry. Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 9.32pm BST 9.27pm BST 68 min: The mood inside Stamford Bridge: Stamford Bridge, home to champions 1yr ago, desperately willing its team on to a draw against a side they've not lost to in 26yrs. Brutal. — Dan Levene (@danlevene) May 2, 2016 9.25pm BST 67 min: Diego Costa gets on the end of the corner, but heads it back out for another one. Eriksen is not hurrying over these corners and abbregas gets the second away. But still Tottenham stay on the attack, Vertonghen lofting the ball to the back post but Begovic getting in the way of the subsequent header at goal. 9.24pm BST 66 min: Tottenham, very sensibly, are putting a metaphorical foot on the ball. Passing it about the back, taking the heat out of the game. Or so it seems until suddenly they pounce - Eriksen finds Mason, whose shot is poor but rebounds for Kane to have another crack: corner. 9.22pm BST 63 min: Hazard is again racing up the middle, but he’s closed down before being able to get a shot away. Hard to know if he is playing so well because he wants to beat Spurs (as he said), is attempting to prove something to fans who have been on his back, is back in form, is looking to impress potential suitors. Ryan Mason comes on for Son. 9.21pm BST 62 min: Hazard has woken Chelsea up. He charges forward, finds Costa then goes for the return pass. Costa doesn’t give it to him, finding Willian instead. His shot is tame though and easily saved. It’s not all doom and gloom in Leicester. Here’s the latest from our video reporter there: 9.19pm BST 61 min: Chelsea have pressed forward now, putting the pressure back onto Spurs. Willian is clattered, and frmo the free-kick Chelsea pour forward again. Hazard finds Costa, who passes the ball back to him. Hazard then finds Ivanovic, who fizzes a ball into the box - Costa handles it in attempting to control it. 9.18pm BST 59 min: Costa finds himself in the clear, he is through on goal and charges into the box … then slips over. Alderweireld clears. 9.17pm BST 59 min: That’s woken the crowd up. The roar is back at Stamford Bridge, but it doesn’t stop Walker from motoring down the right wing and whipping a high cross across the box. There is nobody there to meet it. This game is furiously alive again. The mood improves at Hogarths pub in Leicester. Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA Updated at 9.30pm BST 9.16pm BST GOAL! Chelsea 1-2 Tottenham (Cahill, 58) From the corner, Cahill takes a touch to control the ball and, from about the penalty spot, clatter home a left foot volley. Chelsea back in it! Leicester back in it! Chelsea are back in the game as Gary Cahill fires home. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian Cahill beats Vertonghen to smash the ball in with his left foot. Photograph: John Sibley/Reuters Updated at 9.28pm BST 9.16pm BST 57 min :Hazard flicks the ball to Fabregas, striding forward from midfield. His attempted ball back to the left wing would have sent him clear but for the fact Demebele was in the way. A moment or two later, Chelsea win a corner. 9.14pm BST 56 min :Matic, in what is one or the more unlikely things to type, wiggles his way to the byline up the Chelsea left and clumps a cross in to the Tottenham area. Lloris claims. The momentum very much feels in Tottenham’s favour at the moment. Branislav Ivanovic tries to console Danny Rose after he sustained an injury. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian Updated at 9.19pm BST 9.13pm BST 54 min: A Tottenham corner comes to nothing and Chelsea spend a little time diddling about in the Tottenham half. When Spurs have had enough of that, they race up the other end, Kane finds Rose clear on the edge of the box. Instead of hitting a ball begging to be hit, he passes to Son whose shot is weak and wide. Rose takes a blow to the face in the midst of all that. 9.11pm BST Iman Amrani’s latest video from Leicester is here: a sad Leicester fan speaks 9.10pm BST 52 min: Kane fizzes a ball across the Chelsea box, a ball just dying for a Spurs fot to tap it home. None arrive. 9.10pm BST 51 min: Even Lamela’s getting in on the act. Entirely needlessly, he goes in studs up on Fabregas and flattens him. He gets a yellow. Tottenham may be lucky to end this match with 11 on the pitch. Meanwhile, Hazard - who has been very busy since coming on - clips a shot in, attempting to beat Lloris at the near post. He can’t do it. Erik Lamela attempts to go past Nemanja Matic and Ivanovic. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian Updated at 9.24pm BST 9.08pm BST 49 min: Lamela clips a lovely ball into Kane, who again breaks the offside trap on the left of Chelsea’s area. He angles a good shot across Begovic, aiming for the far post, but the keeper is good enough to stop it. “Why does Diego Costa on a football field always resemble a werewolf who finds himself stranded on Jupiter on a night when all 67 moons are shining brightly?” writes Justin Kavanagh, before pointing out (perhaps needlesly): “He’s a very angry man.” 9.07pm BST 48 min :Hazard, again, does good work up the left wing. He cracks a cross into the box but sees it come straight back out again off a Tottenham head. 9.06pm BST 47 min: Hazard finds Azpilicueta brilliantly and the left back attempts to whizz the ball into the middle for Costa. Walker gets a good block in and the ball goes out for a corner. Chelsea can do nothing with it. 9.05pm BST 47 min: Kane tries to get past Ivanovic but can’t. What he can do, though, is hoof the ball hard against him to win a corner. Lamela delivers it, with Kane dropping back to meet it. But he can’t get power on the header and Begovic claims. 9.03pm BST The second half is under way Peep, peep: Tottenham kick off. 9.03pm BST Nick Honeywell emails: “Quote: ‘Can’t see Dembele avoiding a retrospective ban for that gouge on Costa. His temper is so high, that there’s a chance he’ll get himself sent off in the second half anyway. If I was Pochettino, I’d take him off now.’ “I was thinking he should take Walker off now before he gets a second yellow. So if he does both that’s two of his three changes gone already. A full three out of three if Rose also looks like he needs protecting from himself.” Here comes the second half and Pedro has been replaced by Hazard for Chelsea. 9.01pm BST This is a fair point: Diego Costa is a strange fella. Has his jersey pulled, acts like he's been eye-gouged. Is eye-gouged, acts like he's had his jersey pulled. — Eoin McDevitt (@EoinMcDevitt) May 2, 2016 8.59pm BST Football Weekly regular Ian Macintosh is in Leicester (and has been since yesterday) to capture the mood there. It’s not gone according to plan. Mood in the Slug & Lettuce: Subdued. pic.twitter.com/JEjUOGAfEL — Iain Macintosh (@iainmacintosh) May 2, 2016 8.58pm BST The view from Newcastle: “As a Newcastle fan,” emails Shaun Wilkinson, “can I just say I appreciate Spurs’ efforts to get all their players suspended by the FA before the last game of the season.” 8.55pm BST Party-pooping dept: “Well I, for one, am over the moon so far. While the world is falling in love with Leicester’s fairy tale, I would like nothing more than to see Robert Huth fail to get a winner’s medal,’ writes Matt Dony. “He is comfortably my least favourite footballer, and I have a lot of hate for a lot of players! Harsh on Ranieri, but the heart wants what it wants.” 8.54pm BST There’s a chance this title race will go to the final day - and who wouldn’t want that? Here’s some light reading on title finales from the aforementioned Rob Smyth: Related: Joy of Six: the greatest league title finales 8.52pm BST Can’t see Dembele avoiding a retrospective ban for that gouge on Costa. His temper is so high, that there’s a chance he’ll get himself sent off in the second half anyway. If I was Pochettino, I’d take him off now. 8.49pm BST Half-time Peep, peep: That’s half-time. Spurs have been patient and impressive, Chelsea have been threatening and angry. A great half of football, a brilliant one for Tottenham, a bad one for Leicester. “Was that sex masochism from Dembele?” emails Rob Smyth, of this parish. John Terry appeals to referee Mark Clattenburg. Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty Images Updated at 9.13pm BST 8.47pm BST 46 min: Rose, who wasn’t on a yellow as I thought, is now on a yellow after his involvement in that. As is Willian. Diego Costa holds his face as he clashes with Mousa Dembele. Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty Images Updated at 9.37pm BST 8.47pm BST 45 min: That was shocking from Ivanovic - a square pass in front of goal, which is intercepted. But never mind that: it’s all kicked off. Rose and Willian clash, and Willian shoves the Spurs man. He does so right in front of Pochettino, who charges onto the pitch and gets involved in the tussle. Suddenly, all the players are involved and both benches get stuck in as everything flares up. Eventually Pochettino apologises to Willian. But, in the midst of all that, Dembele scratched Costa in the eye. That would have been a red if the referee has seen it. Leicester City fans watch Tottenham take control at the Bridge. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters Updated at 8.59pm BST 8.44pm BST GOAL!

Costa attempts to bicycle kick the ball into the net, but is offside. Diego Costa tries the spectacular but is offside. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian Updated at 8.54pm BST 8.42pm BST 42 min: Costa is knocked to the ground again but Clattenburg - who has let a lot go - finally whistles. Fabregas hoists the ball to the back post, but there are no Chelsea players there to send the ball home. Lloris claims easily. 8.40pm BST 40 min: Chelsea living dangerously here. Walker pulls the ball back to Lamela, who shoots hard at goal. The ball rebounds and falls to Son, who also gets a shot away. Cahill gets in a despairing block. Chelsea race up the other end and Willian fires a shot wide. This is breathless. 8.39pm BST 39 min: Fabregas is sharp - hanging around in what would have been an offside position, except this was a throw-in. He goes hurtling into the Tottenham box but is challenged before getting a decent shot away. 8.38pm BST 38 min: It was lovely buildup play from Eriksen and Lamela that led to the goal. Meanwhile, Chelsea have reacted badly to going behind: their already roiling temper has gone up a notch. Vertonghen grabs a handful of Costa’s shirt, and the referee gives Chelsea a free-kick, which doesn’t stop Costa from furiously having a go at the Spurs defender. Oof...deathly silence here in #Leicester. Still some way to go yet. Compelling #CFCvTHFC — Christina Macfarlane (@chrissymacCNN) May 2, 2016 8.36pm BST 35 min: The mood in Leicester just took a turn for the worse. A Leicester City fan can’t bare to watch the game. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters Updated at 8.49pm BST 8.35pm BST GOAL! Chelsea 0-1 Tottenham (Kane, 33) Kane breaks clear of the Chelsea back four, springing the offside trap perfectly. He takes two touches in the Chelsea box, goes past Begovic and knocks it into an open goal. Chelsea thought he was offside. He wasn’t. Harry Kane takes the ball past Begovic. Photograph: John Sibley/Reuters And Kane slots the ball home. Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images Updated at 8.47pm BST 8.34pm BST 33 min: Matic and Mikel, stationed in front of the Chelsea back four have done a much better screening job than has been seen in the Chelsea midfield in recent weeks. Doesn’t feel like it’s a coincidence that Terry is back in the back four telling them what to do and where to be. 8.31pm BST 31 min: Kyle Walker is slack, playing a poor pass to Alderweireld. But Costa nips in and steals the ball then whistles a powerful shot at goal. Lloris knocks it over for a corner, which Chelsea waste. Diego Costa fires in a shot at goal. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian Updated at 8.37pm BST 8.30pm BST 29 min: Kane stands over a Tottenham free-kick, about 40 yards out. Ridiculously, Kane goes for goal and, though the ball wobbles all over the place, Begovic watches it go high over the bar. “This is set up for John Terry to be the villain of the piece,” emails Andy Gordon. “An own goal in the 89th minute tonight followed by a winning goal against Leicester in the 89th minute followed by Christopher Walken playing him in the Jamie Vardy movie. Trust me.” 8.28pm BST 28 min: It’s only a few seconds later that a long ball from the Tottenham defence falls to Lamela. He hits the deck and the ball rebounds to Son who is in acres of space just outside the D. He whistles a shot wide, when he really should have scored. Pochettino goes mad in the technical area. 8.27pm BST 27 min: There’s a right old battle up the Tottenham left, with Willian, Ivanovic and Mikel all kicking lumps out of Eriksen. Finally, Ivanovic clears and Pedro attempts to turn Walker up the Chelsea left. Walker flattens Pedro, the referee plays advantage, and Costa passes to Fabregas just inside the box. He has a fantastic chance to score, but scuffs his shot wide of Llloris’ right hand post. Walker gets a yellow. Pedro and Cesar Azpilicueta gesture at the assistant referee on a tense night at the Bridge. Photograph: John Sibley/Reuters Updated at 8.30pm BST 8.25pm BST 25 min: “I know he hasn’t really been involved in much of the aggro so far,” writes JR in Illinois, “but this is shaping up to be one of those games where Costa will do something preposterous. Whether he gets caught will be the question.” He has just gone mildly feral after being flagged offside. 8.24pm BST 24 min: Kane and Mikel tussle, with Kane ending up flat on the floor. The Spurs fans howl, but nothing (rightly) is given. A moment later, there is confusion in the Chelsea defence and Son gets clear enough to shoot - he earns a corner. Azpilicueta clears, but only to Eriksen, but his shot is high and wide. 8.23pm BST 22 min: Dier clumps a ball into the Spurs box from midfield, looking for Kane. A diving header from Cahill sends the ball straight back out. Kane has been quiet so far. Too quiet ... A Chelsea fan holds up a banner in support of former manager Claudio Ranieri and Leicester City. Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images Updated at 8.26pm BST 8.21pm BST 21 min: Dembele lingers on the ball for too long, and Fabregas nips in and takes it off him. Fabregas doing a tackle there, one for the collectors. Fabregas finds Costa, but Dier gets in and heaves the ball out for a corner. Willian can’t find a Chelsea man from it, but the ball is flung back into the box by Pedro. Fabregas attempts to get on the end of Pedro’s ball but Rose slips in front of him, blocking him, and Lloris claims the ball. There’s a lone Chelsea fan, holding up a small banner reading “Let’s do it for Ranieri”, Chelsea’s former manager. 8.18pm BST 18 min: There are further handbags as Chelsea claim they should have had a throw-in which goes Tottenham’s way. With tempers high, Walker then shoves Pedro to the floor. Then get this: Diego Costa acts the peacemaker. Kyle Walker shoves Pedro to the ground. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian Updated at 8.34pm BST 8.17pm BST 16 min: It’s Ivanovic’s turn to clatter a Tottenham player, and he repays Danny Rose’s compliment to Willian by going in studs up on the left-back. He too gets a talking to from the referee who won’t keep his cards in his pocket for much longer if this carries on. 8.16pm BST 15 min: Fabregas clips over a very decent free-kick, the ball arcing over the penalty spot. Several Chelsea heads go up for it, but none connect. A moment later Ivanovic gets clear up the right, before Willian rakes a low cross over. Vertonghen knocks it out for a corner, which Fabregas connects with but knocks out for a goal kick. This match is furiously high octane so far. 8.13pm BST 13 min: Mikel plays a scandalous ball to Willian on the very edge of Chelsea’s box, putting the Brazilian in all sort of peril. He manages to get the ball away, but is flattened by Danny Rose in the process. Rose is warned that, next time, he’ll get a yellow. Clattenburg treading a fine line in a match this heated but probably right to keep his cards in his pocket at this early stage. Mousa Dembele turns away from Pedro. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters Updated at 8.17pm BST 8.12pm BST 12 min: Tottenham are on top at the moment, Eriksen scittering around outside the box menacingly. He finally flings over a cross to Walker coming in from the right. He hits it too high for the Spurs right-back though. 8.11pm BST 11 min: Tottenham quickly rush up the other end, and some smart work near his own goalline from Azpilicueta tidies things up. Still, Spurs keep possession and Danny Rose lines up a long range screamer, whizzing the ball slightly high and slightly wide. Begovic, in the Chelsea goal, is not too concerned. City fans watch the match in a city centre pub in Leicester. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters Updated at 8.13pm BST 8.10pm BST 9 min: Lamela clatters Ivanovic and Chelsea have a free kick, which Willian swings long into the box. Matic is about to go up for it, but the big midfielder is nudged hard in the back by Walker and cannot jump. The Chelsea players appeal for a penalty, which they don’t get. 8.09pm BST 8 min: Dembele, Lamela and Eriksen flick the ball between themselves, all one touch passes, all very quick. Finally, Kane attempts to spring past Cahill with the ball being dinked in over Terry and into the area. Cahill is alive to the threat and heads clear. 8.07pm BST 7 min: Lamela negotiates his way out of trouble deep in the Tottenham half and Spurs attack, attempting to spring Kane clear. Chelsea regroup and force the visitors back to refrains of “Chelsea! Chelsea!” around the ground. The atmosphere is beginning to get the players worked up and, after Mikel pushes Dembele, the Spurs man gives him a shove back. Clattenburg tells everyone (but the crowd) to calm down. 8.05pm BST 5 min: Diego Costa is sent to the pitch again, and complains to the referee about it. Mark Clattenburg could not care less. Again Azpilicueta goes on a promising run up the left, but runs into a Spurs defender who locates Row Z. Cesar Azpilicueta takes the ball away from a floored Kyle Walker. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters Updated at 8.09pm BST 8.04pm BST 4 min: Corner to Chelsea, swung over to the back post. Cahill arrives late in a penalty area marked by players grappling with each other. The defender sends his header wide though. “Dramatist to immortalise the goings-on at Jamie Vardy’s house party: Leicester’s very own Joe Orton,: writes Charles Antaki. “He probably hated football, so there would be extra sizzle in the dialogue.But probably not a happy ending. 8.03pm BST 3 min: Dier lets Diego Costa what he’ll be in for tonight and gives him a little tap. Chelsea play across the back four before Azpilicueta goes on a run up the left that amounts to little. The crowd at Stamford Bridge are in rare form: a really noisy atmosphere in west London tonight. 8.02pm BST 2 min: Eriksen goes on a run down the Spurs right wing and makes it to the edge of the box. He can’t find space for a cross though and Chelsea retain possession. He’s playing down the right, with Son in the hole as a No10. 8.00pm BST Peep, peep! We’re off: strap in.

This is what she’s discovered: 7.46pm BST I don’t understand a word of this, if I’m honest. “I’m not an economist but have heard of a concept called moral hazard, characterised by increased risk-taking when the costs of the risk is borne by someone else,” writes Peter Oh. “Could it be that Chelsea will pour forward tonight (risk getting caught on the counter) because the cost (failure to end Spurs’ hopes) is spread out among Leicester’s remaining opponents? Or am I overthinking things, and the only moral hazard is the wisdom of leaving Hazard on the bench, if this is indeed a must-win(-to-deny-Spurs) match for Chelsea?” 7.35pm BST Stamford Bridge looks a little like this at the moment: Terry did some jogging alone when he first came out.

He will probably get his time but I am being careful with him. Pedro and Willian have done their jobs really well. We have a good luxury problem. Never guarantee but he might come in later.” Hiddink says John Terry and Gary Cahill are back in the squad because they know the significance of the match. “We have nothing to fight for regarding silverware but the players know they have to end the season really well.” On stopping Tottenham: “There’s a lot of fuss about this game, but it’s another game.

We need to believe in ourselves.” On Son being in the side for the suspended Alli: “He’s very fast, he’s trained very well in the last few weeks, we have different options and we say why not Son?” 7.14pm BST The talk before the match is how up for this the Chelsea team will be, desperate to beat Tottenham, desperate not to give them a sniff of winning the league. The converse point hasn’t been made all that much, however: that Tottenham are hardly going to be taking it easy. They are in the hunt for a first title since 1961, it seems unlikely they won’t be up for it too. What it means is, this match could be a belter. 7.12pm BST A rumour is doing the rounds that Claudio Ranieri is not, in fact, in Italy but is currently at Stamford Bridge having changed his flight plans. No confirmation of that, though, just a rumour. Also, failed to spot this earlier, Hazard on the bench.

Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian Updated at 7.17pm BST 6.55pm BST Chelsea find themselves in an unusual position tonight: they have most of the country backing them. This time a year or so ago, as Chelsea were poised to win the Premier League, it would have been perfectly valid to point out that the club were likely to again hold the destination of the title in their hands come May 2016. No one thought that these would be the circumstances, however. For a team that were such dominant champions in 2014-15, it is just one more curiosity of a wild season that Chelsea find themselves both washed up but also potential kingmakers. For the modern Chelsea, this has been the most un-Chelsea-like of seasons. In recent years, and perhaps as a consequence of José Mourinho’s sprawling influence, their success has been underpinned by a furious rage. Under their most successful manager, they swept to titles with confrontational obstinacy, their team spirit built on an attitude fostered by the coach that everyone was out to get them. When, under André Villas-Boas, there was outright rebellion in the ranks, the team reacted to his sacking with screw you vindication. They won the Champions League almost out of spite and with a team featuring those who were accused of undermining Villas-Boas – Frank Lampard, Ashley Cole and Didier Drogba, with John Terry in full kit in the stands. Under Hiddink in 2009, they won the FA Cup with similar defiance following the sacking of the unpopular Luiz Felipe Scolari. The run to the Champions League final under Avram Grant in 2008 was built on fury at Mourinho’s first sacking and the spirit fostered by the core of Terry, Petr Cech, Drogba and Lampard rather than much nous on Grant’s part. The Europa League final victory under Rafael Benítez in 2013 was once again underpinned by irritation bubbling beneath the surface, Lampard and Terry aggrieved at being sidelined by the Spaniard. Perhaps only under Carlo Ancelotti recently did Chelsea succeed without temper, and it was both something the Italian once bemoaned and probably something which contributed to his dismissal by an owner used to something more ruthless from his side. This season? The anger has come from the stands alone – directed, rightly or wrongly, at those the fans feel were responsible for Mourinho’s sacking in the brooding, bitter days of December. The team’s response to that sacking has not been the ire of old, or even relief, but mere halfhearted revival. Of the old warriors, only Terry remains but his rage now exists against both the dying of the light and the club for their refusal to offer him a new deal yet. His diminishing status highlights another issue Chelsea have yet to address. Ever since the chaotic Terry-free defences (by injury as well as design) of Villas-Boas’s reign, when Gary Cahill attempted to figure out just what David Luiz was going to do next, it was clear there was no one in the side able to direct the players on the pitch as well as Terry did – and the supine loss against Manchester City, with no one in the back four demanding more from the ineffectual Jon Obi Mikel in midfield made it clear little has changed four years on. What a shame for Chelsea’s legions of kids out on loan that they are not here to push their case. For the likes of Nathan Ake (impressive at Watford), Andreas Christensen (so disillusioned at his limited opportunities in London he doesn’t much want to return), Todd Kane (outstanding at NEC), Nathaniel Chalobah (kicking his heels in Naples), Lewis Baker (promising in Arnhem), Tomas Kalas (much loved in Middlesbrough) or Fikayo Tomori, Patrick Bamford or Isiah Brown, it is their misfortune to be absent at a time when they might have hopes of a run in the first team. Their desire to impress might shake some life into Chelsea. But enough about that: no one really cares about Chelsea tonight. This evening is all about Spurs and Leicester. Updated at 7.15pm BST 6.46pm BST The mood in Leicester, or at last in one particular house if not most of the city, will be tense this evening. Leicester City’s striker, Jamie Vardy is having a party, and he’s invited all of his friends. The squad are gathering at his place to watch the Chelsea v Spurs match where they could celebrate winning the Premier Title for the first time. Leicester City’s Christian Fuchs and Robert Huth arrive at Jamie Vardy’s home. Photograph: Darren Staples/Reuters Claudio Ranieri, however, will not be there. He flew back to Italy following the 1-1 draw against Manchester United in order to take his 96-year-old mother out to lunch. He is flying back to the UK tonight, as the Chelsea match plays out, and will not know until he touches down whether his side will have won the league. Meanwhile, in Bangkok: The Thai Buddhist monk Phra Prommangkalachan chants next to the sacred holy unbeatable Leicester City fabric cloth and talisman at Wat Traimit temple in Bangkok. Photograph: Rungroj Yongrit/EPA Updated at 7.14pm BST 6.38pm BST Preamble It’s simple enough: if Tottenham want to stop Leicester City from winning the title tonight, they will have to do something they have not done in the Premier League era. Spurs’s last victory at Stamford Bridge came in the old Division One in February 1990, and Chelsea have not been beaten in the following 25 matches (17 wins, eight draws). A draw tonight will do Tottenham no good, they need three points or Leicester are champions. That said, Chelsea are a rabble. They’ve not managed to keep a clean sheet in 10 matches, and have not won at home in their last three fixtures. However, after such a disappointing season, Chelsea’s players know that beating the fans’ hated rivals, Tottenham, would at least provide a crumb of comfort. As such, it’s been interesting to see the two players who have been banging the ‘we must beat Spurs’ drum the hardest: Cesc Fàbregas and Eden Hazard. Both players were labelled “rats” by Chelsea fans following the departure of José Mourinho, and both have had poor seasons. “The fans, the club, the players, we don’t want Tottenham to win the Premier League,” Hazard said. “We hope for Leicester because they deserve to be champions this season.” “I don’t want Spurs to win it - I want to be honest and clear,” said Fàbregas, honestly and clearly enough. It’s not gone down well at Spurs, where Mousa Dembélé’s cage has been properly rattled as a result of their comments. “I am surprised at what Eden has said. He is not the type of person to normally make those types of comments or to envy other people’s success,” said Dembélé. “I won’t pay too much heed to his comments and those from Cesc Fàbregas, who has said similar things. People come up to me in the street and say: ‘Did you hear what Hazard said? What’s his problem?’” It is, as they say, on.

The last English sides promoted despite drawing more often than winning are Rochdale and Bradford City. In 1968-69 both sides gained promotion from the fourth division, with both sides winning 18 and drawing 20. Scunthorpe would be the first side to do it since the introduction of three points for a win. Now the Knowledge isn't the sort of trivial column to pander to lazy stereotypes, but when it comes to drawtastic campaigns for some reason Italy springs to mind. And indeed the statistical quirk has been a fairly common occurrence in Serie B over the years, so common in fact that it's only really worth noting a few more extreme examples. In 1981-82 Pisa stormed into Serie A on the back of 12 wins and 23 draws in their 38 Serie B games. And in 1979-80 Pistoeise did likewise on the back of 12 wins and 22 draws. In 1988-89 all four promoted teams from Serie B drew more often than they won, with Udinese's 19 draws to 13 wins the most notable ratio, while Cremonese (making a bid for the title of Dullest Promoted Side Ever) went up from Serie B in 1990-91 after 19 draws, 12 wins and only 28 goals in their 38 matches. In 1991-92 Brescia topped Serie B after 21 draws and 14 wins, and in the final season before three points for a win was introduced, Padova in 1993-94 won 11, drew 21 to ensure promotion. That might have been that, but two years later Bologna took the Serie B title after 17 draws and 16 wins, Bari were promoted in 1997-98 after 18 draws and 15 wins, Lecce went up in 2002-03 (15 wins, 18 draws) and so did Atalanta in 2003-04 (19 wins, 20 draws). EATING ON THE PITCH \"Dani Alves's excellent response to a racist idiot at Villarreal got me wondering,\" begins Dave Browne. \"It's not the main talking point to come out of the incident, obviously, but it has to be fairly rare to see a player eating mid-match. Have there been any others?\" Alves is not the first player to have eaten something thrown in his direction during a game. After admitting his fondness for Mars bars, Paul Gascoigne was on more than one occasion pelted with nougat and caramel wrapped in chocolate. In a Rome derby while at Lazio, he picked one of the offending items up and, as John Foot records in Winning at All Costs: A Scandalous History of Italian Soccer, \"slowly unwrapped it and gobbled it down\". But not all mid-match munching is a result of terrace idiocy or bigotry. Rio Ferdinand was spotted munching down a couple of Jaffa Cakes mid-match against Charlton Athletic in 2006, but Columbus Crew striker Dominic Oduro went a level or two further by incorporating a pizza as part of his goal celebration: Any more for any more? Send them to the usual address: knowledge@theguardian.com WHICH TEAM HAS HAD THE DIRTIEST EVER SEASON? (2) Last week we looked at the teams to have had the most red cards in a single season. Here's Sean DeLoughry with another entry into the canon: \"In 2009, under manager Sean Connor, Dundalk set a new European record with 20 red cards in the League of Ireland Premier Division, in just 33 games. (It's often reported as 19 as one of Simon Kelly's three red cards that season came after the full time whistle.) We played 25 minutes against Sligo with just eight men (and drew 2-2) and had two players sent off in another three games, but we did sneak into Europe. Dundalk picked up one more red card in an ill-temepered FAI Cup replay against Bohemians which saw nine Dundalk players carded in a game that could easily have ended seven a side.\" KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \"Fifa rules apparently state that teams must name three goalkeepers in their squad for the World Cup,\" wrote Joe Diaz back in 2010. \"Has anyone ever used all three, or is it just a complete waste of a squad number?\" Article 26.3 of Fifa's World Cup Regulations (a thrilling read if you have the time) indeed states: \"Each association will be required to provide Fifa with a final [squad] list of no more than 23 players (three of whom shall be goalkeepers).\" The convention of naming three keepers in a squad goes back to 1934 (the United States had named only one in their squad in 1930). Several teams changed goalkeepers mid-tournament in the early years but you have go all the way to 1974 to find the first substitute goalkeeper, when Mwamba Kazadi of Zaire conceded three goals in the first 20 minutes and was replaced by Tubilandu Dimbi (who went on to concede another six). The need to use several goalkeepers is rare – in 1990 the 24 teams used a total of 27 keepers, while as recently as 1998 the 32 sides in France used a combined 36. In all, only four teams have ever used three goalkeepers in a single World Cup tournament. That's out of 371 teams to have qualified for the finals – surely time for Fifa to change the rules. First to use a trio of keepers were France in 1978. The No1 was Jean-Paul Bertrand-Demanes who played in Les Bleus' opening game against Italy. In the second group game against Argentina, Bertrand-Demanes smashed either his back or head (it varies between reports) on a post after pulling off a save and had to be replaced by Dominique Baratelli, a 31-year-old who had made sporadic appearances since 1969. He conceded the winning goal against Argentina and was replaced for France's final group game by Dominique Dropsy. The game against Hungary was Dropsy's debut and he would go on to win another 16 caps. Neither Baratelli nor Bertrand-Demanes would ever play for the national side again. Belgium went into the 1982 tournament with the eccentric (he served a three-month ban in 1980 after elbowing a linesman in a Belgian Cup match) but hugely talented Jean-Marie Pfaff as their first choice. Pfaff had been welcomed, somewhat apprehensively, back to the fold after missing the 1978 European Championships because of his practical joking, but he couldn't keep his inner comedian under wraps. He was dropped following the first group stage after apparently pretending to drown in the swimming pool at the team hotel. His replacement in Belgium's opening game in the second group stage was Theo Custers, whose performance against Poland was so abject it was his last (\"Custers's last stand,\" notes the World Cup historian Cris Freddi). For the Belgian's final game Jacky Munaron took the gloves. Also in 1982, Czechoslovakia used three keepers. Zdenek Hruska played from start to finish against Kuwait, but Stanislav Seman was preferred for the Czech's game against England. A calamitous performance – it would be his last for the national side – lasted 75 minutes before he broke a finger and was replaced by third-choice Karel Stromsik, who kept the No1 spot for the final group game. The most recent team to use three goalkeepers in a single tournament were the hapless Greece side of 1994. The Greeks had gone undefeated through qualifying and named the experienced Antonis Minou, who had conceded only twice in five qualifiers, as No1 for the opening game against Argentina. A 4-0 defeat saw 25-year-old AEK keeper Elias Atmatsidis in goal against Bulgaria. Another 4-0 defeat followed and he was replaced by 24-year-old Christos Karkamanis for the final group game. That brought a slight improvement in fortunes – a 2-0 defeat to Nigeria. For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive.

The glass-fronted restaurant perches on a hillside with breathtaking views over the beach, harbour and town. It isn't surprising to find such a high-end restaurant on the Côte d'Azur. But this isn't the celebrity haunt of Saint-Tropez, Cannes, Nice, or Monte Carlo – it is Menton, the little-known last stop on France's famous coast before you cross into Italy. Menton is an unlikely location for a restaurant that regularly makes the annual list of the world's 50 best (it is currently number 28). It's a sleepy little town, beloved by genteel visitors who come for its microclimate – said to be 3C warmer than the rest of France – and exotic gardens. But Mirazur, which was taken over by Argentinian chef Mauro Colagreco in 2006 and has been growing in reputation ever since, has put it on the culinary map. The restaurant's dishes are deceptively simple, based around two or three ingredients from the fish market or the its own gardens: sea cucumber with spring onions, say, or Cevennes onions with taleggio sauce and black truffles. On my 11-course tasting menu (€105pp, plus wine), just one dish, crispy pork with pickled pears, contained meat. Dishes are delicately garnished with flavour-packed herb snippets and bright pink or purple edible flowers. Cherry and green bean salad at Mirazur Photograph: PR This attention-grabbing restaurant has brought Menton a glimmer of the limelight that the area's more famous resorts bask in, but it still feels like an ordinary small town, albeit one with an exquisite medieval heart and an extraordinary setting between mountains and sea. The beaches – a mix of stony and sandy, public and private – are packed in high summer, but out of season they were empty. To me, it felt warm enough in mid-March for sundresses and flip-flops, but locals were still in coats and scarves – one even stopped me in the street to ask if I was cold. It didn't help that it was pouring with rain – so much for the \"316 sunny days a year\" trumpeted by the tourist board. Luckily I was in town to eat, not to sunbathe. The cuisine has a notably Italian influence – being so close to the border. It did not become part of France until 1860, having belonged to the Republic of Genoa in the 13th century, to Monaco from the 14th, and been a protectorate of Sardinia in the 19th. At Le Bouquet Garni (+33 4 93 86 20 71, 1 rue Palmaro, about £30pp), run by a family from Rome, the standout dish was a simple tomato and mozzarella salad made with the freshest, creamiest burrata. Le Cirke (+33 4 89 74 20 54, restaurantlecirke.com, about £25pp) on the seafront specialises in seafood – the signature grande friture is a delicious mix of crispy fried squid, prawns, scallops and white fish, served on a sheet of brown paper with nothing but half a lemon and some bread (ask for aïoli and a side salad). One of the chefs at Mirazur told me he likes to eat at Le Petit Port (+33 4 93 35 82 62, 4 rue du Jonquier, about £60pp) on his days off: it's a more upmarket (read pricey) bistro with local specialities. Menton seafront. Photograph: Scott E Barbour/Getty Images Photograph: Scott E Barbour/Getty Images Regional dishes to look out for include barbajuan, a sort of ravioli; socca, chickpea pancakes; and pichade, a tomatoey version of the pissaladière onion pizza/tart speciality. There's an excellent covered market each morning at quai de Monleon, but the one at Ventimiglia, a short train ride across the border, is even better, with the added excitement of going shopping in a different country. Mirazur chefs buy from this market, which has a huge mix of stalls, from commercial vendors to old women selling a few vegetables from their garden. Menton is proud of its citrus fruit, and there are lemons everywhere. Shops are crammed with lemon products: try the jams and liqueurs from Maison Herbin (2 rue du Vieux Collège), lemon-infused olive oil from Oliviers & Co , and lemon biscuits from La Cure Gourmande, both on rue Saint-Michel. But when a town plays up its fruit-growing prowess, you can be pretty sure it's not a place to party. There are plenty of cafes on the seafront and at the foot of the old town for pre-dinner drinks, but not many buzzier sports. So when a bar caled Time's (facebook.com/menton.times) opened last year on rue de la République, it was welcomed by the town's young people, who go for cocktails and live music until 12.30am – a late night in early-to-bed Menton. Musée Jean Cocteau. Photograph: Patrick Aventurier/Getty Images Photograph: Patrick Aventurier/Getty Images However, there are daytime charms aplenty. A new museum dedicated to Jean Cocteau (museecocteaumenton.fr), Menton's adopted artist, writer and film-maker son, opened in a prime position on the quay in 2011. A blockbuster exhibition of works by Cocteau, Matisse and Picasso is running until 3 November. Included in the €8 admission price is entry to the Bastion museum, a 17th-century fort in the harbour wall that was restored and decorated by Cocteau. Another stop on the Cocteau trail is the town hall's register office (Place Ardoïno), which Cocteau adorned with wall and ceiling murals. Menton couples still get married in his Salle des Mariages, which can be visited for €2 – when there isn't a wedding taking place. You don't stroll around the gorgeous old town; you hike up it. The steep cobbled medieval steps and alleyways are dark, narrow and winding. Shafts of sunlight reveal jumbled dwellings in muted shades of ochre and pink and gold. On rue Saint-Michel is the basilica of the same name, a baroque church with a landmark belltower. This is one of the venues for the Menton music festival each August (festival-musique-menton.fr). A little further on is the ornate Chapelle des Pénitents Blancs, and right at the top, you come to the cemetery on rue du Vieux Chateau. A peaceful spot with incredible views, it is a place of pilgrimage for rugby fans: the sport's inventor, William Webb Ellis, is buried there. Staying in Menton is certainly more affordable than in its glamorous neighbours. I opted for the reasonably priced Hotel Napoléon, a bright, modern hotel with decor inspired by Cocteau and British artist Graham Sutherland. Rooms have balconies with views of the Mediterranean or the Alps; there is a small pool in front and a garden at the back (vice versa might have been better). The hotel is in a great location on Garavan bay, to the east of town, 100m from the beach and a 10-minute walk, past Menton's two pretty ports, into the centre. Menton may not have Saint-Tropez's party people, Cannes' film stars or Monte Carlo's high rollers, but that's what makes the town so appealing.

And their favourite places to eat.\" The man, an engineer and hobby archaeologist who was born and raised in Rome, slapped his hand to his forehead. \"Our taxi drivers,\" he shook his head, \"are terribili!\" He was not the first person to warn me about taxi drivers in Rome. Year after year, they are voted among the worst in the world. According to a 2011 EuroTest report by 22 European automobile clubs, \"Rome's taxi drivers are aggressive, do not respect speed limits and traffic lights, and take long detours off the requested route.\" In other words, if there was any city where taxi drivers were going to take me for a ride, it was Rome. But however naive it might have sounded to the Roman I met on the plane, I believed that some of the capital's 8,000 tassisti would show me where to find good things to eat in their city. I based this belief on a steak. Five years ago I decided to climb into a random cab in Buenos Aires and ask the driver to take me to his favourite restaurant. After the taxista delivered me to a transcendent bife de lomo at a side-street steakhouse called Parrilla Peña, I started hopping into cabs in Buenos Aires, Berlin and New York, asking drivers where to eat and documenting my discoveries on a blog called taxigourmet.com. In New York, I met two female cab drivers who showed me the way to Jamaican curried goat and Puerto Rican mofongo – and convinced me that I could drive a yellow taxi, too, which I did, for a year, chauffeuring everyone from hysterical brides to ex-New Yorkers searching for pastrami. No one, my colleagues taught me, knows a city better than a cabbie. And four trips to Italy had taught me that few people know food better than Italians. What would happen if I tested these two truths in Rome – a city with some of the greatest food, and some of the most notorious taxi drivers, in the world? \"Buona sera,\" I said to the tassista who was parked, along with six of his colleagues, next to the Esso station on Piazza Albania. He winced at my accent and started rolling a cigarette. \"I'm looking for a cheap restaurant not too far from here,\" I continued. \"I never eat at restaurants around here,\" he said. The trio of 'pizzaioli' at Pizzeria Remo. Photograph: Alamy Photograph: Alamy A tassista in a brown T-shirt with an opera singer's belly stepped out of his cab. \"Go to Testaccio,\" he said. \"There are lots of restaurants there. You'll find something.\" \"No, no,\" I said. \"I'm a taxi driver, too. I want to go somewhere you would eat.\" \"Somewhere I would eat?\" the cigarette-rolling cabbie said. He looked at the chubby tassista. They started laughing. \"Hey!\" said the chubby tassista. \"What about Remo?\" \"Si!\" said the cigarette-rolling cabbie. \"Remo! They have good pizza.\" \"Can you take me there?\" I said. \"You don't need us to take you!\" said the cigarette-rolling cabbie. \"Turn right at the signal, then left, then right. It's on Piazza di Santa Maria Liberatrice. There's a pharmacy across the street.\" I'd already started to question the stereotypes about Roman cabbies on the walk to Pizzeria Remo and one glance at the Italian families celebrating on Tuesday night at the restaurant's pavement tables and one bite of pizza bianca con fiori di zucca – with olive oil, mozzarella, courgette flowers and a sprinkling of anchovies – moved me to outright optimism. True to Roman tradition, the toppings were spare but fresh, and the crust, thinner than the plate, charred on the edges, chewy but soft, was the masterwork of a trio of bandana-wearing pizzaioli who manned the wood-burning oven next to the entrance of the restaurant. The tassisti could easily have driven me in circles before dropping me off here, I thought, but they didn't. Layne Mosler in her cab in New York. Photograph: Rumen Milkow Photograph: PR Were the tassisti at Piazza Albania the exception rather than the rule? The next day I walked to the taxi stand at Piazza Bologna, 4km north-east of the city centre, to find out. Rossella Falasca was driving the cab at the front of the queue. \"You won't find Roman food in this neighbourhood,\" said Falasca, who has been driving for nine years and is one of approximately 1,200 female cabbies in Rome. \"You have to go to Testaccio or Trastevere. But that way,\" she pointed to Via Sambucuccio d'Alando, \"is a good seafood restaurant. I went there a few days ago.\" Marco Magliozzi, the owner of La Fraschetta del Pesce, was amused that a tassista had sent me to his restaurant. \"Our pasta boiler is broken,\" said Magliozzi, who worked as a fisherman and owned three fish stores before he opened La Fraschetta this March. \"But we can do some antipasti, maybe a fritto misto for you.\" What followed – calamari with olive oil and lemon, mussels steamed with garlic, leeks and Castelli Romani white wine, grilled sea bass, crab and shrimp – were glorious expressions of what Magliozzi calls cucina alla marinara: simple dishes designed to showcase the quality of \"our seafood\". After I met Simone Bellini, my rising faith in the food knowledge of Roman cab drivers reached fever pitch. The tassista led me to fantastic versions of rigatoni alla carbonara and trippa alla Romana at La Tavernaccia da Bruno – a family-run trattoria a few blocks from where the cabbie grew up, near the train station in Trastevere. He also insisted I try La Nuova Cantinetta, an archetypal Roman trattoria in Garbatella where he eats rigatoni alla pajata (with tomato sauce, milk-fed calf intestines and pecorino Romano) every week. Reality hit after I took the underground to Cinecittà, the film studio where Federico Fellini made La Dolce Vita. There, on the outskirts of Rome, I hoped to find a tassista who could show me a restaurant that wasn't in a guidebook. Instead I met a cabbie who told me about a \"terrible\" taxi driver in Bangkok who cheated him, as he took the long way to the centro storico before delivering me to a restaurant where he tried to negotiate a kickback from the hostess in exchange for bringing me there. Cinzia Perroni, a professional soprano who has been moonlighting as a tassista for five years, tried to explain the behaviour of her unscrupulous colleagues. \"Before, some Roman cab drivers were dishonest because they were stupid,\" she said. \"Now it's out of necessity. There are too many taxis and not enough passengers. But there's something really weird and really fun about this job. And I love to eat!\" She wrote down the addresses of seven of her favourite restaurants, including Il Tunnel, where she's been eating risotto alla crema di scampi since she was a girl. \"It's the best in Rome,\" she told me. I didn't actively seek out female cab drivers in Rome – but they seemed to have the most interesting stories and the best food recommendations. Tassista Laura Piccolo, who studied mathematics before she started the job 12 years ago, was, I thought, a case in point. But as we searched for a trattoria she wanted to show me, she circled the same block three times – and left the meter running. When she found the place, it was closed. Was the cabbie trying to cheat me? In the end we stopped at Perilli, Piccolo's favourite place for rigatoni alla carbonara. It said €18 on the meter, but she wouldn't take more than 12. \"I got lost, honey. You don't have to pay for that!\" She handed me her card: \"Call me later and tell me if you liked the carbonara.\" Layne Mosler is the author of the Taxi Gourmet blog (taxigourmet.com) Six of the best cabbie-recommended restaurants in Rome Giuseppe Ruzzeto, chef at La Tavernaccia da Bruno.

But split it into four sections, with two consecutive overnight trains, and it becomes an epic journey, a mini inter-railing trip – this time with children – and with the train travel almost the best part of the holiday for everyone. It is hard to imagine that you save time going to Sicily by train, but you can do much of the journey while you are sleeping. Our children were so excited by getting into bed on the train that the (admittedly long) process of getting there was a very happy period – rather than an instantly forgotten chunk of time spent on a plane. The short and joyless Easyjet trip home was a reminder that, ordinarily, the travelling part of a holiday is something you endure until the holiday begins in earnest. And although train travel costs more than budget flights, it allows you to throw in day trips to Paris and Rome on the way, without paying for hotels. Because our planning was chaotic, we ended up going away for four nights (two of them in train compartments) but it was an amazingly relaxing trip. Not only is it possible to visit Mount Etna, by train, with three children for a long weekend, I'm now convinced this is the only sensible way to do it. I travelled with my children (Rose, nine, and William, seven), my sister, Tabby, and her son (Alexander, six). General disorganisation meant we booked tickets so late that there were no direct tickets to Paris. We rerouted via Lille, stopping to have lunch in a cafe in the old town, dragging our small suitcases for the 10-minute walk from the Lille Europe station. We ate croque-monsieurs and steak haché, played cards and spilt Coca Cola on the cafe table; the children learned how to apologise in French. 'The children enjoyed the Eiffel Tower's lift, and spent most of the time admiring each other's Eiffel Tower key rings.' Photograph: Rainer Martini/Getty Photograph: Rainer Martini/Getty Images/LOOK At Paris Gare du Nord we bought a carnet of metro tickets and took the RER to the Eiffel Tower. The weather was bitingly cold, which meant the queues for the tower were relatively short: and we waited for only about three-quarters of an hour. Fortunately, it is possible to take cabin baggage-sized suitcases up the tower, so long as you don't feel shy about security guards unpacking them in front of the queue. The weather was so misty that the top of the tower was closed, and even halfway up the wind was so icy that we were happy to leave after a few minutes. The children enjoyed the lift, and spent most of the time admiring each other's Eiffel Tower key rings, bought from a pavement seller. We took a taxi to Gare de Lyon in time for supper in the beautiful Train Bleu restaurant. With its frescoes of Mediterranean scenes, gilt finish and polished wooden panels, this was more appreciated by the adults than the children, who were not keen on the food and dismissed it as \"too grand\". With minutes before the train left, we ran to the Franprix supermarket by the station and bought a picnic – grated carrots, yoghurt drinks, brioche rolls, biscuits, oranges and pistachio nuts, which was much more popular. Le Train Bleu restaurant, Gare de Lyon, Paris. Photograph: Alamy Photograph: Alamy On the Rome train we had a six-bed couchette to ourselves, which was lucky. I think we would have enjoyed ourselves a lot less if someone else had joined us, and I think a stranger's enjoyment of the trip might have been impaired in equal measure by the noisy enthusiasm of our children. There was a lot of fighting over who got the privilege of the top bunk, but it turned out that the middle bunk is the best place to be (from a child's perspective) because you have the excitement of being high up, with the thrilling risk of falling out of bed, but you also have the window view. The gentle rolling motion of the train made it easy for the children to go to sleep. They insisted on having the blind up so they could look out as they fell asleep, but did not wake up as we stopped at various stations through the night, nor were they disturbed by banging doors and people stamping about in the corridor. They were thrilled by the ladder and by the sheets wrapped in cellophane, and the individual reading lamps that could be turned on and off – repeatedly. As we left Paris, the trees were bare and wintry; by morning, as we approached Florence, Tuscany was beginning to show signs of spring, with a few green leaves on the trees and a few flashes of blossom. We saw Tuscan castles and hilltop villages. The children found a cafe a few carriages away, and returned with Fanta for themselves and, for me, a cup of coffee so disgusting that I was not sorry when a jolt on the track tipped it all over me, leaving brown slimy residue on my clothes. I rinsed them in a basin at the end of the carriage, and there was almost enough time for them to dry before we arrived in Rome. There was a momentary dip in our mood when we saw at least 100 people ahead of us in the motionless queue for left luggage at Rome station. I stayed in the queue while the others disappeared to have more breakfast, but they returned quickly having found a hotel ready to rent us a room for the day. We left our suitcases at the hotel, and began a tour of Rome, starting with coffee in a cafe opposite the Coliseum, before walking to the Forum, along to Trajan's Column, then on through the old town to Piazza Navona, stopping to buy blister plasters for Rose and ice-creams for everyone. We visited the Pantheon, walked across the Tiber, sat down for a long time on the pavement edge, watching Indian buskers perform levitation tricks on wooden sticks, and stopped to buy more ice-creams. By the time that we arrived at St Peter's Square, the children had comprehensively had enough, so we went back to the hotel to watch cartoons for a while before going out for pizza. It is true that the children were more excited by plastic splat balls on sale everywhere for a euro than by any of the sights, but the sun was out and we stopped at cafes, so everyone was happy. The children also started feeling the effects of a lot of train travel towards the end of the day: the ground beneath their feet felt wobbly, and they wondered if perhaps Italy was having an earthquake. On the Catania train, we had two adjoining cabins, with three bunks in each. The Italian train was generally superior: the sheets were pink (which did it for the children), the beds were already made up, there was a complimentary pair of paper slippers to wear as you walked around the train, and each cabin had its own sink. The children were extremely tired and went to sleep quickly. The only downside of having our own sink was the way the noise of the wheels on the track roared up, rather disturbingly, through the plughole, until the swaying of the train rocked you unconscious. Before leaving, we had been very excited at the idea that the train was going to be shunted on to a boat and ferried across the sea to Sicily. In the event, this happened at around 5am and we were too comfortable and too asleep to register much more than the noise of the carriages being packed one by one into the hold. There was nothing to see – and no sign of the sea. But once we were in Sicily, the train took a beautiful coastal route towards Catania, with views of seaside villages and houses on rocks overlooking bright blue water. As we travelled south, we had left winter behind us, and because we were travelling slowly by train, we were very aware of the gradual journey towards spring. The ticket collector handed out croissants and thick pear juice in cartons. It was amazing to arrive at Catania having travelled most of the way from King's Cross and the grime of London's Euston Road by train. In the cheapish and lovely Hotel Etnea, all five of us slept in one enormous yellow room. If we peered out of the window to the right, we could see the volcano (which was having a mild eruption), puffing out white clouds of smoke. We took a taxi up, past the alarming post-2002 eruption moonscape, where roofs of old buildings are just visible above the stony lava. When we left to take the cable car up to the summit, the taxi driver insistently pressed on us a dirty brown blanket from the boot of his car, which we accepted out of politeness. Later it turned out to be essential, because the peak was covered in snow and ice, and we were dressed for the beach. I had to hire boots, and buy a sweatshirt, and the children wrapped themselves in the blanket and wept with misery as a guide made us walk along the snowy crest of the mountain to see a crater, and feel hot gusts of air blow up from beneath gulleys of ice. It was hard to believe we had packed so much into so little time. We had done such a lot that none of us could remember what day it was, or how long we had been away, or how many countries we had been in. We filled the children with Sicilian rice balls and doughnuts to keep up their spirits. Train station at Giardini Naxos, Sicily. Photograph: Alamy Photograph: Alamy A travel agent recommended that we travel from Catania to more picturesque Taormina, but by this point even our enthusiasm for trains was flagging. Besides, Catania is an amazing city, which (in April) has very few visitors, so we were the only people in the Roman amphitheatre where we spent the afternoon, relishing not being among thousands of ant-like tourists, as we had been in Rome. The children spent a long time watching snails trying to escape from a wicker basket in the fish market. When we stopped for lunch in a nearby cafe, the stall owner, mistaking their interest, walked over with a large slimy bagful and made the chef cook them for us. They looked barely dead when they arrived, in garlic sauce, and we managed to eat only three. When you travel by train the holiday begins the moment you get to the station, and that station is usually in the centre of town. Train travel makes you conscious of how much time you waste when you fly – getting to the airport, then all the milling around there, queuing to check in, queuing for security, queuing to get on the plane, politely jostling for a seat, the bad mood-inducing wait for take-off as you breathe in the chemicals from the plane loos. The only good thing about the flight home was that we were able to get the 25 artichokes we bought for €3 from a street corner stall through security. We ate Sicilian salads in London for the next week. • Adult rail travel was provided by Rail Europe (0844 848 4070, raileurope.co.uk), which has one-way fares from London to Sicily from £176.50 adults, £135.50 children.

The fashion for ultra-pizzas has spread throughout Italy. But as Coccia is constantly being reminded, this is Naples, the home of the tomato and mozzarella margherita. Since opening in 2010, Coccia's restaurant, La Notizia, has whipped up an almighty row, provoking an army of growling traditionalists to voice their contempt for Coccia's daring combination of salt cod with mozzarella, his use of figs and pesto and his €25 truffle oil pizza. His innovative – some would say sacrilegious – approach has divided a city. \"There is no such thing as gourmet pizza, we are not OK with this,\" said Sergio Miccu, head of the Neapolitan Association of Pizza Makers, which has secured EU certification for the margherita and another Neapolitan standard, the tomato, garlic and oregano marinara. \"Pizza was born as a food for the poor and any complicated pizza loses its identity,\" he added. To prove his point, Miccu listed off the elements that make up the perfect – and now Brussels-patented – margherita: a 33cm diameter, 2-3cm high crust, San Marzano tomatoes, cow's milk mozzarella from the region of Campania and olive oil, all cooked in a wood oven after the dough has risen for nine hours. But a growing number of pizzaioli, or pizza makers, up and down Italy, are pushing beyond that, taking their lead from a Rome restaurant, La Gatta Mangiona, which has tried out duck and asparagus and steamed chestnut and mushroom pizzas. In a country that normally prizes simple ingredients and traditional recipes, pizzaioli are now attempting stilton and port pizzas as well as shrimp, saffron and liquorice pizzas. For Coccia, the economic downturn means more chefs are colonising the poor man's food. \"As the crisis makes people want to spend less on eating well, two-starred chefs I know are rushing to install wood-fired pizza ovens, while I am being considered a chef instead of just a pizzaiolo,\" he said. What makes Coccia different is that he has dared to open for business in the town where pizza was first popularised and where in 1889 a pizzaiolo named his new mozzarella, tomato and basil pizza – mimicking the white, red and green of the Italian flag – after Margherita of Savoy. Naples' staple got a further boost from the 1954 Italian comedy The Gold of Naples, where Sofia Loren plays a pizzaiola in the working-class district of Materdei. Five decades on, Starita, the local restaurant which kitted her out for the role, is still pulling in the crowds. \"I am dead against these gourmet pizzas – a pizza restaurant must be quick and cheap and turn out at least 400 pizzas a night,\" said Antonio Starita, 70, whose grandfather opened the restaurant in 1901. \"I have seen cream being used, and it doesn't get worse than that,\" he added, while pounding dough beneath the obligatory photos of the pope and former Napoli footballer Diego Maradona. At Di Matteo on Via Dei Tribunali in the heart of Naples, where 600 pizzas are served a day and a margherita costs €3, the owner, Salvatore di Matteo, dismissed the ultra-pizza trend as \"just like a cold, by which I mean it should pass\". \"For me,\" he added, \"gourmet means talking about what you eat.\" A third of Di Matteo's business is folded and fried pizzas – typically stuffed with ricotta, provola cheese and cicoli, a local type of pancetta. For Neapolitans, he said, it is even more of a tradition than the margherita. \"Fried pizza was bigger than oven-baked pizza in Naples until the 1950s. It needs good oil and a pizzaiolo who can tell the oil's temperature just by looking at it – it's such a hard technique that it hasn't caught on outside Naples,\" he said. For food expert Davide Paolini, the new gourmet pizzas \"can be great, but it's no longer pizza\". He did, however, praise the work of the new wave of pizza chefs in perfecting the dough base. \"Gourmet pizzaioli are doing serious research on flours and methods of raising the dough, particularly Enzo Coccia,\" he said. While his ingredients may be raising eyebrows in Naples, Coccia's light, perfectly baked pizza bases – thanks to his fanatical attention to detail – are winning plaudits from his peers. After a long night's baking, he still has the energy to describe the perfect mix of humidity, volume and temperature for raising dough, before he sketches out the perfect proportions for a pizza oven on a napkin. \"This hasn't changed much since the Greeks, but we are always looking to improve on things,\" he said. At a second restaurant on the same street his menu is strictly traditional. As for the ingredients at his gourmet venture, some may be unorthodox but all are rigorously local. \"I did a fried pizza with mussels and pancetta based on my grandmother's skewers of mussels and pancetta, dipped in egg and breadcrumbs then fried,\" he said. \"If I am innovating, it is only because I know the traditions.\"","Id":"world/2012/may/20/ultra-pizza-naples-gourmet-food","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Naples chefs take sides in the 'ultra pizza' wars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/20/ultra-pizza-naples-gourmet-food","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/may/20/ultra-pizza-naples-gourmet-food","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":870,"webPublicationDate":"2012-05-19T23:18:00Z","id":"world/2012/may/20/ultra-pizza-naples-gourmet-food","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"The full Monti: Rome's cool quarter","body":"The Colosseum may be one of Rome's main tourist attractions, but wander up the slight incline away from the famous amphitheatre and you'll find endless gems of architecture, craft, fashion and restaurants tucked away in narrow streets and quiet corners. Formerly the city's seedy underbelly – where prostitutes and outlaws took refuge until as recently as the 1940s – Monti is now an enclave for the city's young, creative flock, and has the new upstarts to prove it. Strolling the cobblestone streets, you're likely to hear the hum of a designer's sewing machine or the thud of a hammer in a jeweller's shop. The neighbourhood, named after one of Rome's seven famous hills, marries modernity with historical charm – from the fresh new ventures rubbing up against centuries of crumbling craftsmanship to the dapper signore ordering his cafe next to a bedraggled hipster. Smaller and less touristy than the nightlife hub of Trastevere, it retains a strong community vibe. Read on to get a view of the neighbourhood that's off your standard guidebook grid. Ai Tre Scallini You'll know you've arrived at this enoteca when you spot hordes of wine-glass-grasping Italians spilling out of a stooped, ivy-lined doorway.

The rustic, wooden bar is stocked with a wide-range of Lazio wines as well as a few old-school beers on tap, and small plates are served for both lunch and dinner. We're fans of the mouthwatering melanzane di parmigiano, polpettine al sugo (meatballs in a tomato sauce), and the ricotta cheese paired with truffle honey. They don't take reservations and the place is full by 7pm, so plan to sip a glass standing up while you wait for your table. • Via Panisperna 251, +39 06 4890 7495, wix.com/colosseoorg/aitrescalini.

And you can find your home in Rome at this new bar styled after a fashionable 60s abode. Complete with a kitchen (pots and pans included) a parlour with a sofa, and even a plush bed in the back room, the space has a cool-yet-domestic vibe. All objects are for sale, from the wine in the fridge to the fabulous clothes hanging in the closet, and there are drinks and snacks to fuel your roaming and buying. It opened in December 2011 and has quickly become the new hip hangout for the city's creative crowd. This gives it an interesting blend of homey and haute: feel free to put your feet up, just remember that your shoes are being judged. • Via Clementina 9, Casa Clementina on Facebook. Open every day La Carbonara Photograph: Jennifer Appenrodt Photograph: Jennifer Appenrodt This old-school trattoria has been churning out delicious Roman fare since 1906. Owned by the Rossi family – with Mama Teresa taking the culinary helm and son Andrea working the front of house – the restaurant has become a neighbourhood institution. It's hip (Roman musicians and actors frequently stop by), yet cosy with tables packed close together and customers being encouraged to scribble notes on the walls after their meal. The artichoke antipasto selections (both Judea and Romana) are superb, and standout primis are the carbonara and the strozzapreti. For your second course, try venturing into the world of quinto quarto (Roman offal dishes), and go for the tripe or coda alla vaccinara (oxtail stew). • Via Panisperna 214, +39 06 482 5176, lacarbonara.it/; Closed Sunday. Antico Forno ai Serpenti Photograph: Antonio Mariniello Photograph: Antonio Mariniello When this place opened in December 2011, owner Alessando Santomauro envisioned creating a modern space that churns out traditional Italian treats. For the food, he enlisted Sergio Conti – hailing from a long line of bakers – who's on site every day overseeing the production of his family's recipes. And for design, Santomauro enlisted two local architects to create a French chic atmosphere that strays from the typical forno format. Stop by in the morning for delicious cornetti or in the afternoon for a slice of pizza bianca, a simple Roman style pizza topped with only olive oil and salt. Guests love their misshaped brutti ma buoni (ugly but good) gluten-free cookies and la mela in camicia, a flaky pastry filled with cinnamon-topped apples. • Corner of Via dei Serpenti and Via Panisperna.

Walls are draped in aged magazine paper, wooden crates overflow with seasonal produce, and fresh eggs and tarts are on display. Serving food exclusively from the region of Lazio, their quiche-like tortes are delicious, as are their soups and salads. Customers can dine at the mismatched tables and chairs, and the fact that you need to fetch your wooden, biodegradable spoon from the cupboard further emphasises the cosy atmosphere. Make sure you check out the shelves – laden with artisanal food products such as olive oils, jams, sauces, teas, and organic fruit juices – before you hit the cobblestone road. • Via Panisperna 225,+39 06 4782 4611, miamarket.blogspot.com.

Here, alongside each other, lie an Iraqi ceramic model of a river boat from around 2900 BC; a model of a covered wagon from Syria from about 2300 BC, collected by Lawrence of Arabia; Cretan jars wreathed with sinuous, octopus designs from about a millennium later; and a sixth-century BC Attic vase from Sicily, decorated with an image of a chariot. The display is designed to illustrate ancient trade routes; but what if it told a deeper story, too? As Tim Whitmarsh, professor of ancient literatures at the University of Oxford says: \"What if what we think of as the classical world has been falsely invented as European, for reasons serving the cause of 19th-century imperialism? Should the Greek and Roman worlds, albeit in different ways, be seen rather as part of the Iraqi-Syrian-Palestinian-Egyptian complex? If so, what would that mean for ideas about European identity today?\" It's not new to think in terms of Greece borrowing from the east and south in the period before its fifth-century BC efflorescence: Greek statuary and temple-building have long been known to have had their origins in Egypt, for example, and it is well-rehearsed that there is, say, a relationship between Homer's Iliad and the much earlier Babylonian epic Gilgamesh. Detail from Babylon's Ishtar Gate, now at the Pergamon Museum in Berlin. Photograph: Michele Falzone/JAI/Corbis Photograph: Michele Falzone/JAI/Corbis In a controversial three-volume book, Black Athena (1989), the late author Martin Bernal also sought to place the origins of Greece in Africa and the eastern Mediterranean, which in turn was a riposte to the 19th century racist view – what Whitmarsh calls the \"massive cultural deception\" – that the Greeks owed their brilliance to Aryan origins in central Europe. But there is a fresh urgency, according to Whitmarsh and like-minded scholars, to the study of the classical world's relationships with what is now the Middle East, and the new approaches are significantly different from those offered in the past. Access to newly discovered or newly available texts is allowing classicists to reframe the terms of engagement between cultures: less a one-way importation, followed by transformation and \"perfection\" of the original influences, and more a dialogue, or an \"intertwining\" as Johannes Haubold, professor of Greek at Durham University, puts it. So, instead of the study of ancient Greece being predicated on its uniqueness – its isolated, exceptional and untouchable brilliance – some scholars are recasting the Greek world (and, in different ways, the Roman world) as part of a series of networked cultures in multivoiced conversation with the lands lying east and south of the Mediterranean. This is not a universally applauded approach to the study of classics. On the right, Bruce Thornton, professor of classics and humanities at California State University, Fresno, has written slightingly about \"multiculturalist attempts to denigrate the Greeks' achievements\" (he has also described their victory against Persian conquest in the 480s BC as a liberation \"from the shadows of superstition and bondage to the irrational\"). From a less political perspective, other scholars suggest caution, too: Greg Woolf, professor of ancient history at the University of St Andrews, warns against taking the notion of a happy ancient multiculturalism too far. The ancient Greeks, he says, \"were in the business of creating an autonomous civilisation. There were cultural conflicts, and separateness, and limits to transferability. We don't have a Greek version of Gilgamesh, or Babylonian versions of Homer\". The Babylonian world map. © The Trustees of the British Museum Photograph: British Museum Photograph: British Museum Woolf talks in terms of deliberate moments of hybridisation – such as the creation of the cult of Isis in Egypt after Alexander the Great's conquest. That was, he argues, an official fusing of Greek, Egyptian and Macedonian elements as a practical and locally contingent act (though the cult later spread widely through the Roman world, even as far as York). \"Someone has to think of a chicken tikka pizza,\" he says. \"It doesn't just happen.\" Whitmarsh concedes: \"In a way, what we are saying is modish, it's multicultural, it's a model almost resembling the internet projected back on to the ancient world.\" But, he says: \"It does in fact make sense of the archaeological data.\" He adds: \"There is a strongly political dimension to the kind of claim I am making, and you would probably find that most people who were pushing for a very hybridised vision of the Greek world would … be naturally more left-leaning and have their own idealised view of the ancient world as a place of opportunity and hybridisation. \"There's obviously a political parallel in the present – yet at the same time I wouldn't want to reduce the argument, because there is new data available that shows that the ancient world was rather different from the way it was even recently understood to be. Let's say the implications of the view are political, rather than the motivations behind it.\" So what are these implications? Barbara Graziosi, professor of classics at Durham University, says: \"It is getting classics out of its splendid isolation, finding intellectual common ground in antiquity. And it means working more closely with colleagues in places such as Egypt and Iraq – something that is of course made more difficult by political dichotomies.\" As Haubold argues in his new book Greece and Mesopotamia: Dialogues in Literature, it is an approach that can beckon towards the \"cultivation of multilingualism, polyglossia, the arts of cultural mediation, deep intercultural understanding, and genuinely global consciousness. It can develop these things both as scholarly endeavours and as new forms of citizenship in a globalised world\". Graziosi offers a resonant event from her life: attending a conference on classics at Cairo University following the 2011 revolution against Hosni Mubarak. She recalls European and American colleagues' shock that Cairo even had a classics department; in fact, it was established in 1925. To her surprise, she found a cadre of eager, revolutionary students hungry to engage with classics and to find a way of thinking about Egypt's classical past (it was drawn into Alexander the Great's empire and then became part of the Roman empire) that might help them develop ideas about their present. Mummy case and portrait of Artemidorus. Courtesy of the British Museum Photograph: British Museum Photograph: British Museum \"The students were saying that the revolution does not mean a clean break with the past, but a search for different pasts,\" she recalls. \"Classics offers a way of looking at an Egyptian multilingual, multicultural past, when Greeks, Romans, Egyptians lived alongside each other.\" More broadly, she says, the approach is a reminder that \"it is a fiction that once upon a time cultures were pure and are now mixed\". Graziosi also points out the diffusion of classical texts into the medieval Islamic world. With the emphasis on Greece and Rome as \"the foundation of western civilisation\", it is easy to forget how important the classical world has been in the east, she argues: we owe the survival of many classical scientific and medical texts, for example, to their translation into Arabic during the golden age of Islam in Baghdad in the eighth and ninth centuries. Indeed, argues Whitmarsh, the Roman empire was \"the facilitating grid that produced Islam, in dialogue with Persia\". Woolf talks too of Latin translations of the Qu'ran circulating in 12th-century Europe. In this story of interconnectedness and hybridity, rather than isolation and exceptionalism, there lie enormous intellectual and humanist opportunities, Whitmarsh says. \"What is the implication,\" he asks, \"for a utopian, post-imperial education system? There are three million Muslims in Britain, many of them learning an ancient language already. There's no reason why, in 50 years' time, undergraduate courses shouldn't be packed with people studying Arabic and Greek culture side by side. Of course, this already exists in a limited way, but it's not a cultural phenomenon at the moment and these worlds mostly exist entirely separately, but it seems to me there's nothing natural in that.\" Bust of Herodotus of Halicarnassus (circa 484-425 BC). Photograph: DEA/G NIMATALLAH/De Agostini/Getty Images Photograph: DEA/G NIMATALLAH/De Agostini/Getty Images How does this new approach to the classical world manifest itself? For a start, it means looking at already familiar texts with fresh eyes. Take, for example, approaches to Herodotus, the \"father of history\" who provided The Histories, the great account of the causes and events of the Persian wars of the 480s BC. A decade or so ago, a postcolonial approach to his work might have looked at the way he wrote about non-Greeks – Egyptians, Persians, Scythians and others – and concluded that his responses to the \"other\" tell us more about his own projections than what his, say, Persian characters actually thought or did. Recent scholarship, though, might emphasise Herodotus's own culturally hybrid origins in Asia Minor: he was raised in Halicarnassus, on the Carian coast of modern Turkey – a city that during the Persian wars was part of the Persian Achaemenid empire, ruled by Queen Artemisia, herself half Halicarnassian and half Cretan. Whitmarsh says: \"Halicarnassus was a bilingual Greek and Carian city that had been under Persian occupation. It's not inherently implausible that he had a much more informed sense of the world than we have previously given him credit for. It comes down to networks. If you see Herodotus as occupying a single point from which Greek culture is 'beamed out', that's a less interesting way of thinking of him than as a kind of nodal point between multiple different traditions and cultures. Herodotus's The Histories is a predominantly Greek-voiced text, but that doesn't mean that we should quieten all the other voices that can be detected within it.\" Into this story of cultural cross-currents also falls the study of the Greek-language novel – a Roman-empire era prose fiction genre originating in Asia Minor and revived in medieval Byzantium in Persia. Iambilichus, author of the fragmentary work Babylonian Affairs, was writing in his second language, after that of Syriac, and he may have known Akkadian too. Alexander being lowered from a ship in a glass barrel to view the wonders of the sea. From the Old French prose Alexander Romance manuscript, Rouen, 1445. Copyright © The British Library Board Photograph: The British Library Photograph: The British Library Another culturally hybrid work is the Alexander Romance, a story that recasts the Macedonian conqueror as secretly Egyptian, so the story of his annexation of Egypt becomes one not of conquest but of the return of pharaonic rule. Whitmarsh says the story reflects a Demotic Egyptian literary forebear. \"It is forged in a very distinctive culture in which there are Greeks and Egyptians working together. And it tells the story of Alexander the Great in Egyptian-friendly terms. The interesting thing about this text is that, other than the Bible, it's the biggest seller in antiquity – it goes into 26 languages in antiquity alone, and eventually into [the ancient Iranian language of] Pahlavi, French, Armenian, Bulgarian, Old English.\" (It is also mentioned in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales). Whitmarsh adds: \"It is a world away from the model of Greek culture as continuous, organic, hermetically sealed from outside influence.\" The other corollary of this approach is, Graziosi says, to \"learn other languages – which is of course hard work, but often the only way\". \"Traditional\" classicists such as Haubold, trained in Latin and Greek, have learned Akkadian: he passes on his linguistic skills to about 20 undergraduates a year. Whitmarsh's ventures into Semitic languages have enabled him to read works by, for example, Bardaisan, the second-century AD scholar who inhabited the fringes of the Roman empire and whose works fuse Hellenic, Babylonian and Christian influences. There is, says Graziosi, \"an inequality of availability in source texts: cuneiform [the script in which most Mesopotamian texts are written] was not even deciphered until the 1850s. The first fully scholarly edition of even a text as central as Gilgamesh is only 10 years old. New texts are continually being found – and indeed destroyed – in Iraq and elsewhere.\" She adds: \"We need to have a sense of shared ownership and care for these traditions: it's crucial both in terms of scholarship and politics.\" Although there may be far-reaching implications for this fresh angle of scholarship, Whitmarsh says that the approach is squarely in the tradition of a supple discipline which has always had \"expansiveness and courage and ranginess … Everything we are talking about comes out of an intellectual tradition that has been devoted to self-analysis. You analyse the thing you are looking at, but you also analyse your own motivations for looking at it in that particular way. That's our version of scientific empiricism. Classics is a progressive discipline, constantly confronting its own demons, and coming out better and fresher for it.\" Two views of the ancient world From the introduction to Greek Ways: How the Greeks Created Western Civilization by Bruce Thornton, published by Encounter, 2002 One multiculturalist tactic for diminishing the Greeks is to deny their originality, asserting that they begged, borrowed or stole their ideas from other cultures. We need not dwell on Afrocentrism, the idea that the Greeks stole everything good they knew from black Egyptians; the incoherence and historical ignorance of this theory have been amply and repeatedly demonstrated. But even scholars who should know better indulge the current fashion for Greek-bashing by attributing their achievements to a vaguely defined East ... That the Greeks borrowed from their Mediterranean neighbours is obvious: no human society lives in a vacuum, untouched by the customs of other peoples ... More important, however, is what the Greeks made of their borrowings. Consider the Greek alphabet, the elements of which were adapted from the Phoenician around the 9th century. The Greek changes ... made possible in just a few centuries the language of Homer's epics and Sappho's lyrics, a literary speech unrivalled in expressive power ... by anything found among the few remnants of Phoenician writing. From Tim Whitmarsh's introduction to The Romance Between Greece and the East, edited by Tim Whitmarsh and Stuart Thomson, to be published in September 2013. Classicists are used to thinking of \"Greek culture\" as solid and self-evident, perpetuated through the ages by repetition of certain forms of social praxis (religion, education, athletics, etc.). But such a \"traditional\" conception was only one aspect of Greekness. Collective identities, as Stuart Hall reminds us, have many different modalities: they can be defensive, conservative and resistant to hybridity, but they need not be. In Ptolemaic Egypt, for example, where ethnic groups were taxed differently, those classed as \"Greeks\" included ethnic Egyptians working in the administration, and some Jews. In this context, Greekness was defined in a much more capacious (but no less rigorous) way than most scholars would be prepared to admit. Scholars of classical literature (even the phrase betrays exclusionary instincts) have, by contrast, typically cleaved to the most conservative definitions of Greekness possible. The reasons for this lie deep in the history of the formation of the discipline, which has shaped its practitioners into guardians of cultural and aesthetic value. This is not the occasion to explore those reasons, but it is certainly time to dispense with the prejudices that have followed from them.","Id":"education/2013/jul/11/ancient-greece-cultural-hybridisation-theory","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webTitle":"Ancient Greece, the Middle East and an ancient cultural internet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/jul/11/ancient-greece-cultural-hybridisation-theory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2013/jul/11/ancient-greece-cultural-hybridisation-theory","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":2433,"webPublicationDate":"2013-07-11T15:27:00Z","id":"education/2013/jul/11/ancient-greece-cultural-hybridisation-theory","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Said & Done","body":"Breakthrough of the week Brazil's Inland Revenue: seizing 200,000 counterfeit Jabulani balls in Santos.

Vintage Vespas squeeze between menacing orange buses. Animated drivers shake clenched fists in the air, as tiny two-wheelers swing past, leaving a jam of cars in their wake. Edgy, daring, reckless: I find the idea of seeing Naples like a Neapolitan irresistible. Locals claim the city is so enchanting that one can \"Vedi Napoli e poi muori\" – \"See Naples and die\". I just hope that's not meant literally. Snarling traffic and sunny skies make motorcycles the obvious vehicle of choice. When cars and buses stop at red lights, scooters fill the gaps. Before the green light flickers locals give each other a good stare. Riders flirt with drivers, and couples canoodle across seats, before the entire pack presses their foot to the floor. With a bag of local tips and €5 of petrol, anyone can join in this urban tour. As an Italian scooter virgin, whatever route I chose, my 12-hour jaunt around Naples' winding streets would be a baptism of fire. Setting off through the upmarket district of Vomero, just north-west of the city centre, my clamped knuckles are tinged blue. But my fear quickly dissipates as I'm distracted by the view. What rushes before my eyes is a tapestry of Italy's golden past. There are fin-de-siècle follies with stained glass windows, ritzy hotels from the Grand Tour era, and a rococo church on every block. Heading west, I corkscrew for a mile along the carefree coast road to Posillipo. This beachside suburb was recommended to me by Pippo, the cafe barista next to the scooter shop, as a taste of il vero Napoli – the \"true Naples\". True enough, Posillipo has been in graceful decline since Roman times, with an additional sprinkle of Spanish palazzi and Moorish mansions courtesy of Bourbon rule. Even the graffiti that now covers many of these buildings is effortlessly romantic, \"5/5/11 Giuliana amore, I will never forget this day\". Posillipo's giant Parco Virgiliano – which sits above the ancient Roman Villa Pausilypon – is where the city's youth hang out. With few open spaces in Naples' city centre, a tidal wave of 50cc scooters descends here en masse each weekend. Unlike globalised Rome or stuffy Milan, teenagers here parade a catwalk of homespun style. For boys the trend is spandex jeans, Carrera shades and camp T-shirts. Their cigarette packet warnings are tailored to local sensibilities: \"Smoking will give you wrinkles.\" And every Neapolitan lad's nightmare: \"Cigarettes can make you impotent.\" Naples historic old town and harbour. Photograph: Hemis/Alamy Photograph: Hemis/Alamy But Naples lives up to its lax-lawed reputation. It's a city that lives by its wits rather than by the rules; more freewheeling than fashion-conscious. Nowhere is this tenet more visible than Spaccanapoli, the teeming street that slices the city's age-old Centro Storico neighbourhood in two. The quarter seemingly hosts more people, motorbikes and religious icons than any other place on earth. Wearing a motorcycle helmet here is considered optional. Scootering through Naples' historic centre is a kaleidoscopic blur. Market stalls sell fresh fish, skinned rabbits and live octopus, all for a €1 a piece. I see wheels of pecorino cheese as big as car tyres, plus giant salamis for a fiver and bread buns for just 5 cents each. The ice-cream vendor's shop that I get sandwiched outside is an epicurean's delight. Flavours include milk-free marronita (chestnut cream) and candied-fruit cassata. The cuisine isn't all wholesome however. I catch one local munching through a mozzarella in carrozza (literally \"mozzarella in a carriage\"), gloopy cheese in a crispy fried crust. When done, he gazes into his motorcycle wing mirror and dabs the corners of his mouth with the greasy wrapper, which he then balls up and flings on the floor. For a (somewhat) healthier end to my day I duck into Pizzeria da Attilio (Via Pignasecca 17, +39 081 552 0479) at the end of Spaccanapoli. It's been in business since 1946.

Luxury items like truffles and caviar sit near trays of fresh stuffed pasta and the shelves are loaded with good dry pasta, rice, olive oil and wine. At one end of the shop (pictured above) a superior type of tavola calda (cafeteria) sells a range of fried goodies like supplì - fillets of baccala and zucchini flowers.

Over the last few years, the cool cabinets displaying prepared dishes have got bigger – one holds meat dishes ready to be cooked, like the stuffed chicken legs or beef tagliata; another stocks cooked dishes, such as roast meat or duck in red wine. There are cooked vegetables ranging from plain greens to melanzane alla parmigiana (parmesan aubergine bake) or carciofi alla giudia (artichokes Jewish style). The skilful young men behind the counter look like modern-day pirates with their colourful head scarves and long knives, but they are good-natured and efficient.

Although Erzinio's shop is open from 11am to 8pm its main business is the lunchtime trade. They stock various bread rolls and a small queue forms as gourmet office workers decide what ingredients they want in their chosen bread. Italians like to eat healthily so there is a selection of roasted vegetables to be added to the panini. There are two small rooms seating eight people so you can eat them straight away.

There is a tempting array of fresh pasta, fine quality prosciutto and cheese, smoked fish, caviar and other extravaganze, not to mention the delicious cakes and small savoury nibbles to serve with an aperitivo. Gargani also prepares high quality cooked dishes to take away or eat sitting outside under umbrellas at one of the tables on the broad pavement. The usual Italian favourites can be found here with some exotic additions like couscous.

The choice of bread is good and like most Roman alimentari they are happy to make up a panino with your choice of filling. There is a large selection of leaf teas, stored in smart green metal containers, which is quite unusual in Rome, which is obsessed with coffee.

Around the stainless steel work surface, the bakers chat and joke in their southern Italian dialect while they dust the sfogliatelle with icing sugar, slice the zuppetta and pipe cream into the cannoli. The only still and silent figures in the bakery are the china brides and grooms who stand expectantly in a glass cabinet, waiting for the day when they will sit atop a wedding cake. Despite the pizza and the pasticcino, though, and the quick and slangy Italian, La Rondine sits not on a Neapolitan corner but behind the yellow lines of a backstreet in Bedford, about 50 miles north of London. Salvatore Garganese, who owns the bakery, is as proud of its place at the heart of the town's 16,000-strong Italian community as he is of the 60-year-old community itself. His parents, like thousands of others, left Italy after the second world war to come to Bedford, lured by the promise of work at the brickyards and the opportunity for a fresh start. Garganese was 11 when he arrived; he is now 59. He and his family have seen countless changes over the years as the community spread out and integrated, but the most recent one has them more concerned than any other. After providing decades of bureaucratic and diplomatic support to Bedford's Italians, who account for a fifth of town's population, the last vestiges of consular services in the town are due to end next month as Rome rationalises its British operations. When the vice-consulate closed four years ago, it was replaced by a mini-consulate to handle the community's paperwork needs. However, it will only do so until 30 September. After that, the local Italians – and those who come from all over eastern England to use the sportello consolare – will have to use the internet or post office or travel to the Italian consulate in London to arrange their affairs, renew their passports or clarify their wills. The problem, says Garganese, is that many of the first generation Bedford Italians are too old to log on or head to the capital: \"They're finding the idea of having to travel all the way to London very devastating. I know what you have to go through when you need to produce some paperwork, and some of that generation still have combined pensions because they've worked in Italy – and it's a very, very tough day and it's very expensive to go to London. And if you have nobody able to use a computer … \" The community has a long history of good relations with its fellow Bedfordians, marred only by one incident in June after a nailbiting penalty shootout in which Italy knocked England out of the Euro 2012 quarter finals. In true Italian tradition a cavalcade of horn-blaring and flag-waving cars took to the streets in celebration, only to be met by 150 disconsolate England fans. Four people were arrested in the ensuing fracas. The normally tranquil and cheery community has been galvanised into action by the decision to close the sportello consolare and on 9 September it will hold its first demonstration – a \"pacific protest\" against the move. The mood among the older members of the community is anything but peaceful, and accusations of abandonment and betrayal abound. \"The vice-consulate was always there because it was responding to the needs of the people,\" says 84-year-old Antonio Maggio, who came over to work in the brickyards in 1955. \"But now we're old, we're wondering why we're not Italians any more. We're not Germans or Russians, are we? When they need our votes, they come and find us, but if we need them, they abandon us.\" Anna Chirico, who endured years of mashed potatoes and tea after she and her husband arrived in Bedford the same year as Maggio, cannot understand the Italian government's behaviour. \"I pay taxes in England and in Italy and I expect the service to be there because I've paid for it,\" she says. \"We kept Italy alive in England and now they are treating us like this. We feel like we suffered when we first came here and now we're going to suffer again at the end of our lives.\" Sarah Castellani, the Italian consul in London, said the consulate general was simply reorganising itself before moving into large offices. She pointed out that the Foreign Office had undergone a similar \"process of realignment\" this year when it closed British consulates in Florence and Naples. She added: \"Some of the consular services provided will still be available by post or email, while for other services which necessitate personal attendance, such as the issue of a passport, applicants will be required to come to London.\" The Bedford Italians remain unconvinced. Luigi Reale, who is leading the community's efforts to prevent the closure, argues there is no economic benefit to doing away with the sportello consolare as it brings in more money in passport renewals and other services than it costs to run. He also says that funding for the Italian classes that ensure the younger generation keep close to their roots is being cut, increasing people's sense of abandonment. \"We feel they're [targeting] older people and the children, the most vulnerable people in the community,\" he says. \"We want them to think about the cuts and to not hurt thousands of people here. It's not right and it doesn't save anything.\" The building at the centre of the argument is, to put it kindly, unremarkable. The sportello consolare sits above an international grocery shop on a main road near the Pilgrim's Progress pub and a branch of Cash-a-Cheque. The only clue as to its function is the faded and tattered tricolore which hangs limply outside, its white strip long since tinged grey by the passing traffic. Mario Borromeo, who ponders the fate of the mini-consulate over a slice of pizza and a plastic cup of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo at one of Bedford's many Italian centres, isn't entirely sure which flag is his any more: \"Inside we feel Italian, but outside we're not Italian any more,\" he says. \"I don't know what to call my home. It's not here, it's not in Italy. I am in the middle, so who'll help me?\" Borromeo, who arrived at the brickworks as a young man of 19 from Benevento, makes no effort to hide the bitterness he now feels as a 74-year-old exile. \"The Italians came to Bedford to eat the dust of the bricks because they had to earn a piece of bread. All this, but in the end, nobody wants to know about us any more. That's it.\"","Id":"society/2012/aug/31/bedford-italian-community-consular-services","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Arrivederci Bedford: Italian community up in arms at end of consular services","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/31/bedford-italian-community-consular-services","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2012/aug/31/bedford-italian-community-consular-services","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":1127,"webPublicationDate":"2012-08-31T19:19:17Z","id":"society/2012/aug/31/bedford-italian-community-consular-services","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Eurozone crisis live: Mario Monti's resignation pledge spooks markets - as it happened","body":"6.04pm GMT Closing Summary Mario Monti (left) talking to French President Francois Hollande after the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo today.

Italian bond yields Photograph: Graphic Photograph: Graphic 6.04pm GMT More expert reaction to Monti's exit City experts are warning this afternoon that the crisis in Italy could easily escalate in the weeks ahead, and point to the country's deep fiscal problems. Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics We think it would be no surprise if the renewed upturn in Italian bond yields goes much further and doubts over Italy’s long-term future inside the single currency re-emerge. Although Monti was due to resign anyway ahead of the forthcoming general election (which is due by April at the latest), his decision to do so earlier than expected clearly puts the spotlight back on Italy after a year or so in which it has enjoyed a period of relative political stability and market calm. However, it was only ever a matter of time before worries over Italy’s position re-emerged. After all, despite some optimism over the structural reforms put in place by Monti’s government, the economy’s performance has continued to be very poor indeed. Activity indicators like the composite PMI remain consistent with continued deep recession. Needless to say, this bodes ill for Italy’s fiscal outlook. One hope is that the impending implementation of the ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) programme to purchase Spanish government bonds will help to keep Italian bond yields down. But this seems unlikely to be enough to ease concerns over Italy’s public debt to GDP ratio of 130% and rapidly rising. We stick to our long-held view that Italy will need to undertake a substantial debt restructuring (i.e. default) at some point if it is ever to return its public debt to a sustainable level. Meanwhile, the knock-on upward effect on Spanish yields seen on Monday suggests that renewed worries over Italy could limit the effectiveness of OMTs even for Spain. Monti is a smart man. Bar unlikely surprises, he won’t stand with parties currently on 10% combined. He wants to be president. #Italy — Alberto Nardelli (@AlbertoNardelli) December 10, 2012 Andrew Morris, managing director of Signature In spite of some early good progress by Mr Monti, the country is still in desperate need of reform, particularly in its labour markets. Similar to a number of other Mediterranean countries, it suffers from poor productivity and remains seriously uncompetitive compared to the likes of Germany. Unfortunately, his early departure means that some significant policies will not have time to go through Parliament. Troublingly, much of what he has achieved has been put down to the fact that he was a technocrat and was not affiliated to a party, thus he did not have a party to appease in implementing policy, a luxury his successor may not have. The Eurozone troubles, having shown signs of relative calm over the last few months, are now back on the front page. It should be remembered that many of the problems still lurk unresolved in the background. As today’s market movements show, investors do not like uncertainty and political uncertainty in Italy is definitely not something to be welcomed – however accustomed to it we have become. 6.04pm GMT MONTI: I'm not considering whether to run One door opens....Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti (right) in Oslo today for the Nobel Peace Prize Award Ceremony. Photograph: DANIEL SANNUM-LAUTEN/AFP/Getty Images Photograph: DANIEL SANNUM-LAUTEN/AFP/Getty Images Mario Monti has just ducked a question on whether he might run as a candidate in the looming Italian general election. Italy's outgoing, technocratic PM, told reporters in the last few minutes that the market reaction to his pledge to resign was \"understandable\", and that there was no need to be too dramatic about the news. Monti then declared that he was \"not considering\" standing as a candidate, but it's hardly a concrete denial. Reuters has the key quotes from Monti, who said: I'm not considering this particular issue at this stage. All my efforts are being devoted to the completion of the remaining time of the current government I understand market reactions, they need not be dramatised. I am very confident that the Italian elections, when they come, will give room to whatever coalition...the government will be, in my view, a highly responsible one. 6.04pm GMT European house prices tipped to keep falling Bad news for home owners across Europe from ratings agency Moody’s this afternoon – it reckons house prices will keep falling as billions of pounds worth of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs) issued by banks during the boom years. Good news for those looking to buy, of course. Patrick Collinson, editor of Guardian Money, reports: The near-collapse of low-quality RMBSs backed by sub-prime loans played a major role in the credit crunch and Moody’s said that for southern European countries (and Ireland) there are more losses to come. “In Spain, Italy, Portugal and Ireland, delinquencies and defaults will continue to increase... Moody’s expects that the performance of Irish RMBS and Italian, Portuguese and Spanish ABS [asset backed securities] and RMBS will deteriorate by a moderate to significant degree in 2013.” House prices will fall in every major European country in 2013, except Germany and the UK, where they will remain flat, the agency forecast. “The current inactivity in most euro area housing markets will continue due to the weak macroeconomic environment. Moody's expects a tale of two housing markets in the UK: “In the UK, very strong regional differences in house price developments between the south and the north will lead to relatively flat house prices overall. In Germany, house prices will similarly remain flat in 2013, as the country has had very limited house price inflation during the last decade.” Moody’s says that since 2007, the number of housing transactions across Europe has fallen by 50%– 60%. It notes that while house prices have fallen in Ireland by around 50% since the peak, losses to holders of RMBSs are even higher, rising to 70%. It added that the “oversupply of unsold houses together with weak demand and to lesser extent the eviction moratorium,” will weigh heavily on the Spanish market next year. It expects banks in Europe to ‘modify’ loans - in other words extend the mortgage term or switch to interest-only payments - rather than foreclose on households and crystallise large losses. Already 11% of mortgage loans to Irish households have been modified in this way, it notes. But modification of loans affects the income flows of RMBS, leading to losses for their holders. “Significant losses may arise in Spanish RMBS transactions should any future measure modify the full recourse nature of Spanish mortgage loans.” But it added that the tightened credit conditions in recent years - such as demanding high deposits - will make new RMBSs attractive again to investors. 6.04pm GMT Bersani to Monti: Keep out of the election Political developments in Italy this afternoon – centre-left chief Pier Luigi Bersani has signalled that he does not want Mario Monti to stand at next year's general election. The prolific John Hooper has the details: The leader of the Democratic party (PD), which is currently leading in the polls, said: \"It would be better for him to stay out of the contest, precisely because Monti could still be useful.\" How exactly, he did not explain. At a press conference in his home town of Piacenza, he merely alluded cryptically to the \"need to have an association [with Monti] in the name of Italy\". Bersani may be worried that a new Monti party -- or a Monti sponsorship of an existing or new centre-right party -- could muddy the waters yet further. Or he may just fear losing votes to him. 6.04pm GMT Pedestrians walk outside the headquarters of Bank of Greece in central Athens today.

That means Athens would only have committed €8.85bn of the €10bn of loans which it has been handed to buy back its debt at a discount. The extension is an opportunity find more takers.

Henry McDonald, our Ireland correspondent, reports: Patrick Honohan said he hoped a deal could be done ahead of the next repayment on promissory notes used to recapitalise the now nationalised Anglo Irish Bank. \"The planned repayment of the European Central Bank's aid comes at the wrong time. The government is trying to win back trust on the debt market, and current repayment plan is complicating this,\" Honohan told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in an interview published on Saturday. \"Of course the money will be paid, but it should happen over a longer time frame. That would make much more sense given the wider aid programme for Ireland. We need more time,\" he added. The Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, has staked his reputation on obtaining a deal that would lessen the burden of Ireland's huge bank debts. Opposition politicians continue to claim that, contrary to Kenny's insistence that the EU will offer Ireland assistance, no such deal is in the offing. If you're new to the long-running issue of Ireland's promissory notes, economist Karl Whelan's blog has extensive coverage of how Dublin ended up paying such a high price for rescuing its banks from insolvency. 6.04pm GMT Herman Van Rompuy ended his speech with a nod to America and president John F.

Photograph: REUTERS Photograph: STRINGER/ITALY/REUTERS We should remember that Silvio Berlusconi is not the front-runner to replace Mario Monti. Instead, the centre-left Democratic Party is leading in the polls. Its new leader, Pier Luigi Bersani, has already pledged to continue Monti's work on economic reform and not dismantle the measures introduced in 2012. In this interview with the Wall Street Journal, Bersani said: European policy cannot be focused exclusively on austerity… all of this has raised a real social problem in Italy and Europe...I am quite sure that next year, the situation in Europe will foster a discussion and a revisiting of economic and fiscal policies. Not to overhaul them, but to inject them with some corrections aimed at greater flexibility. This will be Italy's position…but we won't necessarily be the first ones to raise our hands. The WSJ also reports that Bersani, in his youth, led a strike of altar boys to protest his local church's use of donation money. Quite the antidote to Silvio.... 6.04pm GMT Germany isn't immune to the slowdown in Europe's car industry – Opel has decided to stop car production at its plant in Bochum in 2016 after the manufacturing of its Zafira model ends. My colleague Nadine Schimroszik explains: The closure had been long expected and could improve the prospects for Vauxhall's plant in Ellesmere Port. In June, the General Motors' division announced that no successor to the current Zafira is planned for Bochum in view of the shrinking European car market and overcapacity in the automotive industry. About 3,000 people work at the Bochum plant. Opel announced that it plans to offer jobs at the plant beyond 2016 and that this could be expanded. GM, which owns the Opel and Vauxhall brands, wants to reduce capacity in Europe that has been saddled with too many factories in the wake of the credit crunch. Other car producers face the same problems. In October, Ford had decided to close its plants in Southampton and Dagenham. 6.04pm GMT Berlusconi's political strategy explained Mario Monti’s political future may be uncertain, but Silvio Berlusconi’s tactics are becoming rapidly clearer - as John Hooper explains: Berlusconi will renew his alliance with the Northern League and, at the same time, try to split Italy’s biggest centre-left movement, the Democratic Party (PD). Nabbed by reporters as he emerged from sharing a pizza with members of his family in Milan on Sunday night, Berlusconi took the link-up with the League as a done deal: “I’ve already talked to [the League’s founder, Umberto] Bossi and [its current leader, Roberto] Maroni,” he said. In characteristically swaggering fashion, the 76-year-old Berlusconi boasted that he needed no more than a month to beat the leaders of the PD and the Christian Democrat Union of the Centre because “I am younger politically”. And he stretched out a hand to Matteo Renzi, the loser in the primary elections held by the PD last month. If the Blairite Renzi wanted to switch sides, said Berlusconi, “he should know I always have the door open for liberals”. Renzi, though, has rebuffed the offer, without flying off the handle. John adds: Renzi replied this morning: \"Do shut it.\" He was referring to the door. Presumably. 6.04pm GMT Gloomy news from the Netherlands, where the central bank has just slashed its economic forecasts. Reuters reports that the Dutch central bank now expects the country's GDP to contract by 0.6% during 2013 – not grow by 0.6% as previously forecast. It also warned that the Dutch deficit will be 3.5% of GDP next year, which would mean missing Europe's target of 3%. The new government is already implementing billions of euros of spending cuts and tax rises to try and hit that deficit target. PM Mark Rutte must now decide whether to get even tougher (and risk an even deeper recession), or let the deficit target slide..... 6.04pm GMT Italy: what happens next? Here, via Open Europe, is a timeline of how the political process in Italy could play out: The budget law is due to be submitted to the plenary of the Italian Senate for approval on 18 December - although the calendar of works may be tweaked to speed up the process. Once Italian senators have given their green light, the bill will go back once again to the lower chamber for the formal final approval. Therefore, it is fair to assume that Monti could resign and the Italian parliament could be dissolved before Christmas - or immediately after, at the latest. Italian law establishes that the elections have to take place at least 45 days and no later than 70 days after parliament is dissolved. Hence, we are looking at either 17 or 24 February as possible dates - with the latter already mentioned by Berlusconi to reporters yesterday night. That's from this article, which predicts an election campaign dominated by the future of the eurozone crisis and austerity. 6.04pm GMT Bunga Bunga trial devs... Prosecutor Ilda Boccassini (left) speaks during the trial against Italian former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, accused of paying Moroccan nightclub dancer Karima el-Mahroug, also known by the stage name Ruby Rubacuori, for sexual services, at a court in Milan, today. Photograph: DANIEL DAL ZENNARO/EPA Photograph: DANIEL DAL ZENNARO/EPA There has been drama in court in Milan this morning where the star witness in Silvio Berlusconi's trial on vice charges failed to appear to testify. John Hooper reports: Karima el-Mahroug (aka \"Ruby the heartstealer\") is alleged by the prosecution to have been paid for sex by Berlusconi when she was still only 17 years old. Berlusconi's lawyer, Niccolo Ghedini, told the court that el-Mahroug was abroad and that he was unable to reach her. The prosecutor, Ilda Boccassini, then openly accused Berlusconi of dragging out the trial for electoral reasons, prompting Ghedini to accuse her of slander. Boccassini then asked the judges to drop el-Mahroug, who has always denied having sex with the former prime minister, from the witness list. The request is being considered as I write. These sorts of shennanigans ought to work against Berlusconi. But the reverse is probably true: they give him that vital oxygen called publicity. Meanwhile, Italian bonds continue to weaken – the yield on its 10-year bonds has now jumped to 4.87% this morning, up 0.35 percentage points. 6.04pm GMT Van Rompuy: Monti has been great PM Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, paid tribute to Monti this morning - and argued that his successor must continue the same economic reforms. Speaking in Oslo ahead of the Nobel peace prize award, Van Rompuy said Monti had been a \"great\" prime minister, adding: He restored confidence in Italy and Italy is a key player in the euro zone, so he was extremely helpful in keeping stability in the euro zone. Mario Monti was a great prime minister of Italy and I hope that the policies that he put in place will continue after the elections. There is no alternative for sound public finances and a competitive economy. They are the only ways to fight recession and unemployment There is no alternative for what Mr Monti is doing. Van Rompuy has also tweeted a picture of the EU group in Oslo: In Oslo with youth representatives in EU delegation #eunobel twitter.com/euHvR/status/2… — Herman Van Rompuy (@euHvR) December 10, 2012 6.04pm GMT Monti's resignation: Early reaction Here's some early reaction to the latest developments in Italy. Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research I guess it wouldn’t be a proper crisis without a bit of Italian political turmoil... The Italian political situation does neatly sum up one of the major problems that the Eurozone faces and it is particularly pertinent that it should all blow up just as European leaders are preparing to meet to discuss the roadmap for the euro area, specifically the powers to intervene in national budgets and the banking union. Mr Draghi put it very nicely at the recent ECB press conference when he said that one of the problems within Europe was that there had been a lack of trust between politicians of different Eurozone countries as some had strayed too far and too often from the fiscal discipline required by the economic and monetary union. He suggested that this trust was now largely repaired and thus it would be easier in the future to obtain agreement regarding the possibility of a closer union. That was of course before Mr Berlusconi announced his re-entry into front line politics… First big effect of Monti going cld b 2 force Spain to seek bail-out. De Guindos says being considered: ow.ly/fXGsj #euro #news — John Hooper (@john_hooper) December 10, 2012 Kit Juckes of Société Générale The biggest threat to sentiment came from the announcement by Italy's prime minister, Mario Monti that he will stand down once the 2013 Budget has been passed. This came in response to the loss of support from Silvio Berlusconi's PdL party, and the prospect of a return by Mr Berlusconi to front-line politics. In part Mr Monti's decision may be intended to avoid a longer period when the PdL's decision not to support the government blocks policy and allow Mr. Berlusconi to rebuild support (the PdL's poll standing is under 20% currently). Yield on Italy 10 year now 27bp firmer at nearly 4.80%.We are miles below the > 6% level we saw in the Summer ... but this aint good. — Steve Collins (@TradeDesk_Steve) December 10, 2012 6.04pm GMT Bloomberg is reporting that Mario Monti will hold talks with German chancellor, Angela Merkel, later today. #Germany govt spokesman Streiter says Merkel & #Italy PM #Monti will meet today — Linda Yueh (@lindayueh) December 10, 2012 The pair are in Oslo for the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union. Most EU leaders will be there, but not David Cameron - he'll be giving a speech setting out his plan for a new relationship between Britain and the rest of Europe. 6.04pm GMT The disarray that could be caused by the premature fall of the Monti government is only beginning to emerge, our southern Europe editor John Hooper flags up: La Repubblica this morning points to Decree 188, which is due in parliament on Wednesday but may now have to be scrapped. This would reduce the number of provinces in Italy from 86 to 51. Since legislation has already gone through stripping the provinces of certain powers in anticipation of their extinction, the result – according to officials – would be “institutional chaos”. Overnight in some parts of the country, no one would responsible for schools, roads and garbage collection. 6.04pm GMT The sell-off on Italy's stock market has accelerated through the first two hours of trading. The FTSE MIB is now down over 3.3%, having shed 519 points to 15179. The contagion has now reached Spain, where the IBEX is down 1.8%. In London, the FTSE 100 is now down 18 points. David Madden, market analyst at IG, commented: Mr Monti, who has been in power for the last thirteen months, has not only pushed through the country’s austerity programme, but his pro-EU stance has helped bring stability to Italy’s borrowing cost. The voice of anti-austerity in Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, is tipped to make to return to politics. Traders are afraid he might re-gain popularity with his anti-Brussels rhetoric. 6.04pm GMT Italian cardinal backs Monti Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, pictured in October. Photograph: Franco Origlia/Getty Images Photograph: Franco Origlia/Getty Images A senior member of the Italian clergy has weighed in to the crisis this morning. Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco (the elected leader of the Italian bishops) expressed strong support for Mario Monti, and gave Berlusconi a firm thumbs-down. Our southern Europe editor, John Hooper, reports: Arguably the most important development this morning in a country where the Roman Catholic church still wields considerable influence is an interview in Corriere della Sera with the head of the bishops’ conference, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, in which he gives a scarcely veiled endorsement to Mario Monti and an equally patent condemnation of Silvio Berlusconi. As Monti ruminated on whether to run in the general election now expected in February, Cardinal Bagnasco said: “It would be a mistake in future not to take advantage of someone who has contributed in a rigorous and competent way to the credibility of our country”. Using vigorous language for a cleric, he declared that the sacrifices the Monti government had asked of Italians, and which had often fallen on the most fragile elements in society, “cannot be left to go to the dogs”. He never mentioned Berlusconi by name but, in an unmistakeable reference, said: “What leaves one dumbfounded is the irresponsibility of those who think of their own interests when the house is burning down”. Strong stuff. But, as John adds.... Who would ever believe that the church had supported both of Berlusconi’s last governments because of their stance on issues such as in-vitro fertilisation and gay marriage? 6.04pm GMT New Italian industrial production data has been released, and it's much worse than expected. Italy's industrial output fell by 1.1% in October compared with the previous month (analysts expected a drop of just 0.2%). Italy is already in recession, with GDP falling 0.2% in the last quarter. 6.04pm GMT Analysts at M&G are concerned by the scale of this morning's sell-off in Italian government debt: Italy 30yr bond yields have soared 28bps so far (down 4pts), to put in perspective would be 3rd biggest daily sell off of last decade. — Bond Vigilantes (@bondvigilantes) December 10, 2012 6.04pm GMT Key event Back to Italy, and this graph shows how the yield (cost of borrowing) on its 10-year bonds fell sharply at the start of 2012, in the early months of Mario Monti's government. Photograph: Reuters Photograph: /Reuters And after a wobble in the summer, they had been easing steadily in recent weeks before Silvio Berlusconi pushed Italy into a new crisis (as Sony Kapoor of the Re-Define thinktank tweets): Henceforth also known as the #Berlusconi Mount, a term that can also be loosely applied 2 a lot of what the man does twitter.com/SonyKapoor/sta… — Sony Kapoor (@SonyKapoor) December 10, 2012 6.04pm GMT Greece extends debt buyback deadline There are also developments in Greece this morning. The government has announced that its offer to buy back its debt will be extended until noon GMT tomorrow. The original deadline was 5pm last Friday. And despite saying that the offer (in which Athens pays up to 40% of the face value of its debt) had gone well, it is now giving \"handouts\" another opportunity to take part. 6.04pm GMT Another sign of jitters over Italy – the cost of insuring its debt against default has risen this morning. Italian credit default swaps are up 15 basis points at 268bp. 6.04pm GMT Trading in three Italian banks has just been temporarily halted after their shares dropped by around 5%, triggering automatic suspensions.

The main index, the FTSE MIB, has tumbled by 2.3% at the start of trading, shedding 356 points to 15343. With Italian sovereign debt also being pummeled (see 7.56am), it's an alarming start to the day. 6.04pm GMT Monti: I'm very concerned Mario Monti has told Italian newspaper La Repubblica that he is very worried about the situation in Italy. In an interview published this morning, Monti said: If I had to ...describe my feelings today, I would say that I am very concerned. Asked about his own plans for the future, Monti replied \"I don't know\". Speculation has been swirling that Monti – who was parachuted in as technocratic (unelected) PM just over a year ago – could play a part in the looming general election. Until now the former EU commissioner has said he would not run for office. 6.04pm GMT Mario Monti's resignation pledge unsettles markets Italy's prime minister Mario Monti. Photograph: Lionel Cironneau/AP Photograph: Lionel Cironneau/AP Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis. Mario Monti's pledge to resign as Italy's prime minister is sending shivers through the financial markets already today. Italian sovereign debt is being sold off in early trading, pushing up the yield (the measure of borrowing costs) sharply. The yield on Italian 10-year bonds has jumped to 4.79% already, from 4.54% on Friday night. That's a significant move (although still a long way from the \"7% danger zone\" where a country's borrowing costs become unaffordable). Spanish bonds are also falling in value as the political uncertainty in Italy reverberates across the eurozone periphery. The trigger for the sell-off is Monti's decision to resign following the loss of support from Silvio Berlusconi's Freedom People party. Monti declared over the weekend that he will tender his resignation as soon as the 2013 Italian budget has been approved by parliament. As my colleague Tom Kington wrote from Rome: In a pointed reference to Berlusconi's previous government, Monti warned on Saturday that Italy needed to avoid becoming, once again, \"the detonator that could blow up the eurozone\". When the Freedom People party withdrew parliamentary support from Monti on Thursday, the difference between German and Italian benchmark bonds rose by 30 points. Berlusconi will now launch an aggressive election campaign as he seeks to build his party's popularity back up from 15 per cent, which sees it far behind the centre-left Democratic party and in third place behind the Five Star movement led by comic Beppe Grillo. I'll be tracking reaction and latest developments in Italy through the day, along with other key events across the eurozone and the wider economy.","Id":"business/2012/dec/10/eurozone-crisis-monti-resignation-markets-italy","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis live: Mario Monti's resignation pledge spooks markets - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/10/eurozone-crisis-monti-resignation-markets-italy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/dec/10/eurozone-crisis-monti-resignation-markets-italy","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":4702,"webPublicationDate":"2012-12-10T15:43:00Z","id":"business/2012/dec/10/eurozone-crisis-monti-resignation-markets-italy","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Where the world's top chefs eat","body":"La Merenda, Nice, France Cash only, no phone, closed every weekend, tiny and quirky, La Merenda in Nice's Old Town is one of a kind.

He changed very little. He does the cooking single-handedly in the simple, open kitchen at the back.

It's cutely named after its Roman postcode combined with the grade of semolina flour used in the various pizzas, focacce pugliesi and trademark tramezzini (little triangular sandwiches). The latter play to the local love of offal in combinations such as tripe, tomato and mint; braised oxtail, celery and carrots; and tongue with parsley and garlic. There are a handful of places to perch inside the shop but it's primarily a takeaway. • Via Giovanni Branca 88, 00100pizza.com, open seven days a week for lunch and dinner, no reservations, cash only, pizzas sold by weight, from €13 a kg Recommended by: Craig Stoll, owner of four Italian restaurants in San Francisco: Delfina (3621 18th Street), two Pizzeria Delfinas and Locanda.

While the Latin Quarter's Chez Georges old-school cellar bar is certainly worth stopping by for a verre or deux, chances are if anyone recommends a Chez Georges they're talking about this Bourse bistro. Opened by Georges Brouillet back in 1964, it gives the impression that very little has changed since – from the menu crammed with comforting bourgeois classics to its well-heeled regulars.

Kizilkayalar, Istanbul Kizilkayalar first managed to distinguish itself from Istanbul's vast sea of fast-food stands in the late 1970s, when some bright spark, noting that the doner market was somewhat flooded, came up with the concept of the islak (wet) burger. Its sweetly pungent smell first hits you as you wait outside. The burgers are doused in an oily tomato sauce, containing relationship-ending quantities of garlic, then steamed for several hours inside a sticky bun to produce the world's slipperiest slider. Order two right from the start, as putting your hand back into your pocket after your first is a very messy business. • Siraselviler Caddessi 6, Taksim, Beyoglu, kizilkayalar.com.tr, open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, no reservations, cash only, burgers about 80p each Recommended by: Semsa Denizsel of Kantin in Istanbul (Akkavak Sokagi 30).

Perhaps it's the convenient location near Mehringdamm station or the long hours they keep – the late-night queues include a diverse mix of tourists, taxi drivers and loyal locals. You'll always be asked mit oder ohne?, with or without, referring to your sausage and its skin. Undecided?

Select your sausage from a list that takes in Argentinian chorizo, Tunisian merguez, Hungarian kabonos and Slovenian kransky, before heading to the heartland of the wurst, with Switzerland, Austria and Germany represented. Vegetarians get grilled halloumi. All are cooked to order and stuffed inside a grilled baguette with sauerkraut and your mustard of choice.

Which just leaves … 1.04am BST Arsenal are saying “undisclosed fee” and “long-term deal”, which is all a bit annoying and vague but the consensus is that the fee is in the region of £16m and that the contract is either four or five years, depending on who you believe. 12.59am BST Danny Welbeck joins Arsenal! It's official. @Arsenal have signed Danny Welbeck from Manchester United: http://t.co/obyyFMbDW4 #WelcomeWelbeck pic.twitter.com/6yD9nbSkFi — Arsenal FC (@Arsenal) September 1, 2014 12.59am BST The general vibe I’m getting from various reports – entirely scientific process here – is that Arsenal and Manchester United are very relaxed about these two deals happening. 12.53am BST If I was the wrong sort of person I’d start this entry with “A DEAL INVOLVING A MANCHESTER CLUB HAS COLLAPSED!” and then go on to explain that John Guidetti’s loan move from Manchester City to Celtic had bitten the dust, according to BBC man in Scotland Alasdair Lamont. But I’m not that sort of person, so I haven’t. 12.46am BST Hatem Ben Arfa has just been pictured signing something, high-fiving somebody and then hugging Steve Bruce. I’m taking that as official confirmation. Either that or he just bought Bruce’s old Vauxhall Zafira. 12.39am BST More meat on the bones (every time I type that it just makes me hungry) of an earlier story – here’s the full update on the departures of Negredo and Richards from Manchester City. 12.38am BST “The current soundtrack at Guardian Towers should really be this,” writes Ben Smith. And why not? 12.35am BST Sky Sports News currently filming through a window at Hatem Ben Arfa talking turkey with Hull owner Assem Allam. It all seems very convivial. 12.26am BST Has anyone checked if the fax machine has any paper loaded? Ink? Plugged in? It’s worth remembering that, as I’ve mentioned before, Andrey Arshavin’s move to Arsenal in 2009 was not ratified until 5pm on the day after deadline day. That suggests a bit of wriggle room. 12.15am BST Meat on the bones of some earlier moves: Redknapp reunited with Sandro and Niko Kranjcar at QPR Stoke City take Liverpool’s Oussama Assaidi on loan – again West Ham seal late signing of France midfielder Morgan Amalfitano 12.10am BST The current soundtrack here at Guardian Towers: 12.07am BST Falcao has passed his medical — jamie jackson (@JamieJackson___) September 1, 2014 12.04am BST It’s not just Falcao and Welbeck … Burnley Football Club can confirm they have applied to the Premier League for an extension to try and complete a late deal. More news soon.. — Burnley FC (@BurnleyOfficial) September 1, 2014 Manchester United’s Michael Keane is one rumoured target. 12.01am BST So, the Premier League rules I mentioned earlier suggest that United need to have filed the paperwork over Falcao’s move nnnnnnnnnnow in order to comply with Fifa’s deadline (not the Premier League’s). So … 11.55pm BST And indeed Manchester United have strongly dismissed those nascent rumours: no truth in rumours falcao has failed medical #mufc — James Robson (@JamesRobsonMEN) September 1, 2014 11.54pm BST The phrase “failed medical” is beginning to do the rounds on Twitter. I believe the original source is a fake account so don’t hit the panic button just yet, United fans. 11.46pm BST For those of you deprived of the action on Sky Sports news today, the Media Tweets blog has Storified the day for you. (Warning: may include swearing, small dogs, an inflatable doll and a dildo). 11.43pm BST Hatem Ben Arfa has arrived in Hull to general cheering and high-fiving. 11.30pm BST Another happy man with a football scarf: CONFIRMED: #SaintsFC have completed a #deadlineday deal for Toby Alderweireld. Welcome, @AlderweireldTob! #SaintToby pic.twitter.com/E3tXS0M7DX — Southampton FC (@SouthamptonFC) September 1, 2014 11.27pm BST The Leeds United Object Lesson In How Not To Do Deadline Day Social Media: Don't go to bed just yet...there is still work to be done #DeadlineDay #lufc — Leeds United FC (@LUFC) September 1, 2014 Followed by selling two players. And then: After a busy last hour that is us done for the 2014 Summer Transfer Window #DeadlineDay #lufc — Leeds United FC (@LUFC) September 1, 2014 If you like Bad Words, you might want to take a look at some of the Leeds fan responses to that second tweet … 11.20pm BST Sky Sports are reporting that Crystal Palace have agreed a loan deal for Wolves striker Kevin Doyle, with Palace’s Glenn Murray heading out on loan to Reading. 11.18pm BST Our man in Manchester Jamie Jackson has written this piece on United’s summer transfer dealings: Manchester United signings suggest little faith in youth policy. Located at Manchester United: the panic button. Last pressed: by David Moyes in January to buy Juan Mata for £37.1m. Under threat at the AON Training Complex: the club’s trumpeted youth policy. Last seen: Old Trafford, 6 May, on the full debuts of James Wilson, 18, and Tom Lawrence, 20, in a 3-1 defeat of Hull City. 11.13pm BST Rules? You want the rules? You can’t handle the ru… oh, wait a minute maybe you can. Here’s a handy guide from the Premier League about this extension business. A key section: Clubs sometimes conclude deals at the last minute and it is not always easy for them to get everything completed and sent over by 11pm. The deal sheet allows a club to confirm that a deal has been reached in order to allow for additional time to submit the remaining documentation. The sheet cannot be used prior to 9pm and needs to arrive fully completed before the transfer window closes. Once the sheet arrives, clubs have got until 1am in which to submit the full paperwork. But if a club are looking to complete an international transfer, it still has to comply with the FIFA Transfer Matching System (TMS) deadline of midnight. So that suggests Manchester United have until midnight UK time (about 45 minutes) while Arsenal have until 1am UK time. 11.09pm BST And Morgan Amalfitano is a West Ham player: Marseille confirm Morgan Amalfitano has joined #WHUFC... http://t.co/3y0Z6y01C5 — Dominic Fifield (@domfifield) September 1, 2014 11.08pm BST What’s this?

Or a 1? Or a ?? 11.01pm BST BBC Radio Humberside are reporting that Hull also have an extension in which to complete the Ben Arfa deal. 11.00pm BST That’s it! Except that it isn’t, because that’s not how it all works. 10.59pm BST Sky Sports are reporting that both Manchester United and Arsenal have asked for an extension to the deadline. 10.56pm BST Chelsea’s Jamal Blackman has joined Middlesbrough on loan. How many outgoing Chelsea loans is that? So just the 26 outgoing loans from #CFC this summer... — Dominic Fifield (@domfifield) September 1, 2014 How many?! 10.51pm BST And another: Wigan have confirmed the singing of Emyr Huws from Manchester City. The fee is rumoured to be up around £2.5m 10.49pm BST And another deal done in the Championship: Fulham have signed Matt Smith from Leeds for £500k. Expect announcement soon. But Beckford deal has collapsed #FFC #BWFC #LUFC — Daniel Taylor (@DTguardian) September 1, 2014 10.48pm BST While you’re waiting for the big, glamour Welbeck/Falcao news, here’s the full story on Crystal Palace’s deadline day. 10.47pm BST told patience a virtue from inside OT when asking just now about Falcao being confirmed... — jamie jackson (@JamieJackson___) September 1, 2014 No need for United fans to panic, though. These things can happen very, very late. 10.44pm BST If Hull manage to bring in Ben Arfa, do they officially win Transfer Deadline Day? 10.37pm BST Stoke manager Mark Hughes is doing a Redknapp from his car window. “We’re delighted with the window that we’ve had,” he says. 10.34pm BST They’re coming thick and fast now. Gaston Ramirez’s loan move from Southampton to Hull has been confirmed. 10.33pm BST Assaidi has completed his season-long loan move from #LFC to Stoke. — Andy Hunter (@AHunterGuardian) September 1, 2014 10.31pm BST So as it stands we’re still waiting for confirmation of Falcao (Man Utd), Welbeck (Arsenal), Ben Arfa (Hull) and Amalfitano (West Ham). Thirty minutes to go … 10.26pm BST Ludicrous things about modern football No234,045: Hull fans chanting the name of a Newcastle player outside their ground. The deal for Ben Arfa hasn’t happened yet … 10.23pm BST Arsène Wenger was getting some (rather ridiculous) stick for heading to Italy for a charity game. Looked like a decent affair though … In fairness to Arsene, would you rather spend all day in boring meetings or with these guys...? RT @BaggioOfficial pic.twitter.com/FGwHDV00s4 — Amy Lawrence (@amylawrence71) September 1, 2014 10.17pm BST Into the final 45 minutes we go. Our man in Manchester, Jamie Jackson, expects Welbeck’s move to Arsenal to be announced before the deadline. 10.16pm BST Here’s Sandro at QPR: Welcome to the #QPR family, @sandroraniere! #SandroSigns pic.twitter.com/zxlbTBrMAP — QPR FC (@QPRFC) September 1, 2014 Interesting variation on the player-unveiling-photo there. Bit of a badge push. 10.13pm BST Poor old Alan Irvine, Sky’s man outside Everton’s training ground and purple-sex-toy-in-the-ear victim. He’s got a 1000-yard stare on now, and you can’t blame him. The horror, the horror … Photograph: Screengrab 10.10pm BST Micah Richards is a Fiorentina player. That’s such a fascinating move – so much potential but half a career wasted. Good to see he’s willing to try somthing a bit different (that said, expect him to be one of the names featuring heavily on the January deadline day) @MicahRichards è un calciatore della Fiorentina http://t.co/mvsoiXCxur #ACFFiorentina — ACF Fiorentina (@ACF_Fiorentina) September 1, 2014 10.06pm BST Some news from Belgium/the south coast: Official presentation of @AlderweireldTob at @SouthamptonFC will be on Wednesday. Tomorrow back in Belgium to train with national team. — Sven Claes (@svenclaes) September 1, 2014 10.04pm BST A bit of nearly-news from West Ham: We are 50/50 to sign Amalfitano in the next hour, Will update you as soon as its done or not done — Jack Sullivan (@jsullivanwhu) September 1, 2014 10.04pm BST Excellent question: “Just realized that Louis Van Gaal will now manage a father and son combo, not concurrently obviously, but this must be a fairly rare occurrence?” writes Yuval Weber. “LVG and Ajax also won the CL in 1994-95 with Danny Blind as captain, so here’s a question for the 1,057/masses/Knowledge: has a manager ever overseen a father and a son in the European Cup/Champions League?” Any thoughts? 9.59pm BST Everton + Cleverley = no go. Tom Cleverley to Everton doesn't appear to be happening. Everton saying they're done for the day. — Andy Hunter (@AHunterGuardian) September 1, 2014 9.56pm BST It sounds like Harry Redknapp has been chatting to the press pack loitering outside Loftus Road, confirming the signings of Kranjcar and Sandro and giving up hope of a move for Defoe. 9.44pm BST A snap on the Press Association wires: Press Association Sport understands Arsenal have agreed a deal in principle to sign Manchester United striker Danny Welbeck but that talks remain ongoing. And in even bigger news: @John_Ashdown most important deal of the day. John-Arne Riise has signed for APOEL. From Craven Cottage stands to the Champions League... — Lars Erik (@eispeis) September 1, 2014 9.40pm BST A few reports are suggesting that Gaston Ramirez, something of a forgotten man at Southampton, could well be joining Hatem Ben Arfa at Hull, which is a serious injection of creativity. 9.37pm BST “What is the latest time after a transfer deadline that a deal has been completed?” I hear you asking. Handily, the Knowledge has the answer. 9.36pm BST One former Manchester United youngster is on the move: James Grant player @RyanTunnicliffe signs for #Brfc on a season long loan from #Ffc pic.twitter.com/y9ProBewC9 — James Grant Football (@FootballAgentJG) September 1, 2014 9.34pm BST A done deal at Selhurst Park: James McArthur has joined from Wigan. James McArthur has signed a three year contract with Palace after joining from Wigan Athletic for an undisclosed fee. pic.twitter.com/6hLUGbxzuD — Crystal Palace FC (@CPFC) September 1, 2014 9.33pm BST Ninety minutes to go! The BBC’s David Ornstein, once of this parish, reckons Arsenal and Manchester United have agreed a £16m deal for Danny Welbeck. 9.24pm BST And here’s our Merseyside maestro, Andy Hunter with some news from Goodison: “Roberto Martinez still keen on Tom Cleverley but Everton want a loan and Manchester United prefer a permanent deal. This could be a late one, providing someone blinks.” 9.23pm BST Our man in the Midlands, the estimable Stuart James, has sent in this review of Aston Villa’s deadline day: A strange deadline day for Villa. They’ve held onto Ron Vlaar, who is such an influential figure for them in central defence, but failed in their attempts to sign Sergio Canales from Real Sociedad and Tom Cleverley from Manchester United. The word in Spain is that Canales was never likely to make the move. As for Cleverley, Villa fans don’t seem to know whether to smile or cry about the news that the Midlands club has given up on that deal happening. Cleverley’s wages were always likely to be a stumbling block for Villa, who have spent the last few years doing all they can to get salaries down. Equally, there was a sense that the midfielder wanted to remain in the north-west. Villa, though, are clearly not happy with how things have been handled. The path is now clear for Cleverley to join Everton... assuming they come up with the money or can convince United to do a loan deal. Otherwise it could be a long few months for Cleverley. 9.19pm BST The Twitter rumour machine has Welbeck’s Arsenal move moving closer, but we’ll hang fire on that for the moment. The Gunners have announced, though, a couple of departures: Ryo Miyaichi joins FC Twente on loan http://t.co/qTfbvZ2mHS and Ignasi Miquel moves to Norwich http://t.co/L5NRhoQQuj pic.twitter.com/Tiy777yqDV — Arsenal FC (@Arsenal) September 1, 2014 9.04pm BST Two hours to go then. Has Neil Warnock still got something up his sleeve? Latest #cpfc info I have is that they are still trying to sort out a loan for Kevin Doyle which would allow Glenn Murray to leave — Ed Aarons (@ed_aarons) September 1, 2014 9.01pm BST And here’s our man on Merseyside, Andy Hunter: “Liverpool have not yet been told that Fabio Borini’s proposed move to QPR is off but appears the £10m plus add-ons deal won’t go through because of the Italian forward’s wage demands. Borini has stood his ground all summer but, as Brendan Rodgers put it on Friday: “All the players here know their situation. It’s up to them to decide whether they stay here beyond Monday but their opportunities will be very limited if they do.” 9.00pm BST A bit more on Ben Arfa possible move to Hull from our north-east football correspondent, Louise Taylor: Alan Pardew attempting to flog Hatem Ben Arfa to Hull. Ben Arfa is en route now and faces a race against time to a) be persuaded to join Steve Bruce and b) complete the formalities. Pardew was desperate to remove his rebel with a cause but a move to Hull could prove high risk, especially if Ben Arfa were to perform well while Newcastle stuttered. 8.57pm BST To dip into the Championship again for a moment, Wigan have had a useful deadline day. They’ve just signed Denmark international William Kvist from VfB Stuttgart, which makes it three in a day for Uwe Rosler’s team. They picked up Adam Forshaw from Brentford earlier, which is a very nice piece of business, in addition to one-time next-big-thing Andy Delort from Tours. 8.45pm BST Crystal Palace have completed the signing of Zeki Fryers from Tottenham on a three-year deal. Tottenham incurred the wrath of Sir Alex Ferguson when signing the full-back, but it hasn’t really worked out for him at White Hart Lane. At all. 8.41pm BST Hull City have been very busy today, breaking their transfer record for Abel Hernandez and swooping for Mohamed Diamé. Rumour now has it that they’re in talks with Newcastle’s Hatem Ben Arfa, which would seem an odd move from Newcastle’s point of view to me. But no lesser source than the Northern Echo’s chief football writer, Scott Wilson, reckons it is on the cards: Hatem Ben Arfa is heading on Road to Hull as Steve Bruce tries to seal a deal for the #NUFC winger. Doubt that'll go down well on Tyneside. — Scott Wilson (@Scottwilsonecho) September 1, 2014 8.38pm BST Nico Kranjcar has just walked into reception at Loftus Road, put his scrawl on the sign-in sheet, picked up his lanyard and wandered in for talks. 8.36pm BST Manchester United have finally joined Ajax in confirming the signing of Daley Blind. The Dutch utility man has signed a four-year deal, with an option for an extra year. Here’s Louis van Gaal on the deal: “He is a very intelligent and versatile footballer that can play in many positions. Daley is a great reader of the game, he has played under my philosophy over a number of years and he will be a great addition to the team.” 8.34pm BST It’s the big one. Those of a nervous disposition, brace yourselves. In 2011 Sky Sports brought you Stoke’s roll-up man … In 2014 they bring you … Everton’s purple sex toy man: Purple dildo on sky sports news https://t.co/oKIXWFXFMj — geps (@edgardavidsgeps) September 1, 2014 8.30pm BST Transfer Deadline Day – it’s all glamour.

Sweden U21 international Kristoffer Olsson is off on loan to FC Midtjylland in Denmark, according to Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet. 8.16pm BST And here’s our man in the Midlands, Stuart James (via Twitter): “Leicester given up on signing Defoe, who looks to be staying with Toronto. Acceptance that wages would have been a problem anyway.” 8.14pm BST Here’s word from our man in Scotland, Ewan Murray: “Celtic, who are desperate to boost their attacking options after failing to qualify for the Champions League, have turned their attentions towards Manchester City’s forgotten man John Guidetti. Sporting Gijon’s Stefan Scepovic had stalled on a £2.5m move to the Scottish champions last night but that move may not yet be dead in the water.” 8.11pm BST Former Celtic manager Neil Lennon is being interviewed in the Sky studios. He says reading about the Falcao deal this morning “knocked me off my cup of tea”. Which raises several questions, mostly involving giant cups. 8.02pm BST A bit more on Daley Blind? A bit more on Daley Blind. 8.01pm BST It sounds like Jermain Defoe will be staying put, whether he likes it or not. The Toronto Sun’s football correspondent reckons Defoe’s employers have rejected several bids: BREAKING: @TheTorontoSun can confirm that Jermain Defoe will remain at TFC after rejecting multiple bids. — Kurtis Larson (@KurtLarSUN) September 1, 2014 7.57pm BST Verona has got it all – a lovely amphitheatre, plenty of churches, a Shakespearean balcony and now an increasingly dreamy football team: Talking of throwbacks: in addition to Rafa Marquez, it seems Verona are signing Javier Saviola to go alongside Luca Toni. Weak at the knees — James Horncastle (@JamesHorncastle) September 1, 2014 7.54pm BST So, much like Marty McFly in Back to the Future Parts I and III, Arsenal are facing a race against time. Only with Danny Welbeck replacing lightning. Other than that it’s pretty much exactly the same. The clock suggests they’ve got a little over three hours left, but don’t be so sure. Remember Andrey Arshavin in 2009? And Rafael van der Vaart in 2010? Updated at 8.06pm BST 7.41pm BST Manchester United have not reciprocated yet, but Ajax have confirmed Daley Blind’s move to Old Trafford is completed: Transfer Blind naar Manchester United afgerond: http://t.co/AIRTQSpr7G pic.twitter.com/NVSXkvqaym — AFC Ajax (@AFCAjax) September 1, 2014 7.38pm BST Here’s the full story on Danny Welbeck and his possible move to Arsenal. A key line: Arsenal had wanted to explore a loan deal but Welbeck has made it clear that he will only consider a permanent move. Any transfer is also complicated by United’s reluctance to sell to a direct rival and privately Arsenal are not overly confident of securing the player’s signature. 7.37pm BST A deal in the Championship: SIGNED: We can officially confirm the signing of central defender Bruno Ecuele Manga from FC Lorient. http://t.co/UpPhWPhe4I — Cardiff City FC (@CardiffCityFC) September 1, 2014 The reported fee for that signing is in the region of £5m, which is another huge outlay for a Championship club. The breaking of the Premier League record has been mentioned a lot today (the summer tally is currently £783.7m) but it must be a huge record-breaking year outside the top flight too. 7.34pm BST Radamel Falcao is, of course, known as El Tigre. Do you want to see him meeting an actual tiger? And trying not to look incredibly nervous about it? Well, now you can: Thanks to “SCV” for the email flagging that gem up. 7.29pm BST Ever wondered why exactly we have transfer windows? Here’s the full story. I particularly like the fact that its proposal in 1998 came at the same time as the idea of referees in each half. 7.27pm BST An update on Danny Welbeck: we understand that Arsenal are interested, but no deal has been agreed and no medical is taking place. Sky Sports, who were reporting a medical earlier, are currently rowing back a touch from those statements. 7.22pm BST Deal done: Sunderland have snapped up Ricky Alvarez. He looks fairly pleased. Ricky Alvarez completes his move to become #SAFC's 9th summer signing: http://t.co/xxY8hjbFpy #transferdeadlineday pic.twitter.com/dTTgd8Euen — Sunderland AFC (@SunderlandAFC) September 1, 2014 7.16pm BST What's happened so far? The main bits of business: The big one: Radamel Falcao has joined Manchester United on season-long loan from Monaco. Milan have signed Marco van Ginkel from Chelsea. Real Madrid have bagged Javier Hernández on loan from Manchester United. Hull City have smashed their club record to sign Abel Hernández from Palermo. 7.12pm BST Hello everyone. Hope you’ve all been having a grand Deadline Day, opening all your Deadline Day presents, tucking in to your traditional Deadline Day meal and watching the Queen’s Deadline Day speech, all followed by a nice Deadline Day snooze in front of the telly. Well it’s time to WAKE UP! THERE’S JUST FIVE HOURS TO GO! And we’re in for a very interesting evening*. *Please note: evening may not be very interesting. 7.06pm BST That’s it from me now. Handing you over to the good man John Ashdown for the gold run, and I’m not talking about a sprint up and down the office with Jim White’s tie. Thanks for your company – enjoy, and give me a shout when you hear where Welbeck has ended up. 7.03pm BST Not a lot of drama, but plenty of Diame NEW SIGNING: We are delighted to announce the signing of Mohamed Diamé from @whufc_official #UTT pic.twitter.com/II6ZkDot6P — Hull City Official (@HullCity) September 1, 2014 Nah, doesn’t work. 6.59pm BST David Conn has written brilliantly here about the dramatic change of outlook at Manchester United. Must-read. 6.57pm BST Jonathan Biabiany’s move from Parma to AC Milan has fallen through. Anyone like to tell him? Awkward = doing this....shortly before move to #acmilan collapses pic.twitter.com/C9V6HH5IYr — Daniella Matar (@DaniellaMatar) September 1, 2014 6.55pm BST Mohamed Diame joins Hull.... ...where the man on the scene is surrounded by what seems a rent-a-crowd of local kids, two of whom genuinely look identical to those spotted at Leicester. They’re given a “thank you” from off camera as the broadcast ends, presumably for their not-very-lusty expression of delight. Still. Diame is at Hull and that’s a bit of a comedown for a player who was not long ago linked with Arsenal and other Champions League clubs. 6.53pm BST From Chris Martin (not that one, or the other one): “Your inbox is going to be overflowing with this, but I’ll point it out anyway just in case it isn’t. Ufa is west of the Urals and thus is part of European Russia.” A rare instance of not actually being pulled up multiply for an error, this, but yes – my mistake. It’s still a long way from Moscow. And quite a move for Frimpong. 6.50pm BST Sorry Tigers fans Falcao has just failed his medical here at Hyde Leisure Pool, he couldn't swim against the wave machine so the deal's off — Hyde FC Official (@hydefclive) September 1, 2014 And swimming against the tide is exactly what he’ll have to do with United, etc and so forth. 6.47pm BST And Welbeck says “whatever” to a loan: Welbeck's agent via @talkSPORT - \"Danny doesn't want to go on loan. He wants a straight transfer and he has every right to say that.\" — Daniel Taylor (@DTguardian) September 1, 2014 6.46pm BST Square this circle, sent by Brian Hudner: “I suspect Wenger is buying Welbeck only because his surname is an Anglicisation of the French name, Houellebecq, (as in the controversial French novelist, Michel Houellebecq). “The odd thing is that Michel Houellebecq’s own name is not in fact, Houellebecq (or even Welbeck), but Michel Thomas, which is a very Arsenal name in its own way, as Liverpool fans of a certain vintage need no reminding.” Houellebecq’s novel “Whatever” could sum up Arsenal’s deadline day so far. 6.44pm BST Traffic news: Radamel Falcao’s car is part of a two-car convoy en route to the Aon Training Complex. And with that sentence, my soul has shrivelled away. 6.43pm BST Dench Deal Done!

He’ll wear number five. Ufa is not exactly on the ‘European’ side of Russia. This one will be interesting... 6.37pm BST This is more like it! James Beattie is now in Sky’s war room, and tells the world that his Accrington Stanley have signed Andrew Proctor from Bury. A slightly disingenuous-sounding “congratulations” is offered and then he’s pushed into talking stiltedly about Falcao. 6.35pm BST Doug Duffy has visited Urban Dictionary and found out what (...errrr, one of the definitions of) a Dutch breakfast is: “Something which falls just short of excellent, while remaining perfectly adequate. From the fact that the Dutch breakfast of ham, boiled eggs and bread is almost, but not quite, bacon, eggs and a fried slice.” 6.34pm BST Confirmation of Coates' Sunderland move From Andy Hunter: “Business at Liverpool, unbelievable. Uruguay international defender Sebastian Coates has completed his move to Sunderland on a season-long loan.” 6.33pm BST “Emile Heskey to Oxford United,” says Paul Wilcox down below. “Unverified but U’s fans all over it.” No, no, that’s fine Paul. Exactly the kind of response I was looking for. 6.28pm BST There are only four young chaps, who all look eerily similar, behind Sky’s Rob Dorsett in Leicester. “Some of the Leicester fans behind me,” look appropriately agog at revelations of the Defoe bid we mentioned below, before relaxing their faces into give-a-damn carelessness moments later. Leicester have also signed a very shy lad from Swansea called Kris Scott, who looks desperately towards his agent when Dorsett charges towards his car window. It’s not been a great day for the car window. 6.24pm BST There’s no point Sky trying to chat about Wilfred Bony. Nothing doing, it’s been clear all day. 6.24pm BST A few murmurs out there that Leicester are in for Jermain Defoe. Let’s not forget that Toronto FC’s Defoe, as Jamie Redknapp helpfully divulged earlier, doesn’t fancy returning to Toronto. Leicester’s move for David McGoldrick appears to have died a death and their eyes are on the England frontman now – although you rather think a deal with MLS may be complicated at this stage. 6.18pm BST While we wait for Welbeck, because this is – when all is said and done – what we’re all reduced to now, feel free to tell us of any particulary eyecatching/amusing/weird/banal lower-league transfers you’ve happened across.

That’s what happens when you barricade yourself in the London Colney physio room. It might just be a rub down after England’s sesh from earlier, of course. 6.11pm BST Harry Redknapp has just turned down a car window interview And Sky’s Gary Cotterill looks like a man forced to cover up for a deep, deep personal affront. He genuinely didn’t know what to do there. It’s you Gary. You. Sandro seems to been joining QPR though, rendered unnecessary by Spurs’ Stambouli move. Updated at 6.12pm BST 6.09pm BST “Any Cavani rumours to report?” queries Cata Panzera. No. 6.06pm BST Someone sees method in the Falcao madness. That someone calls him/herself ‘TheDutchBreakfast’: “Is it just me or is the Falcao deal the shrewdest and best bit of soccer dealing since Harry Redknapp bought his dog? “Maybe transfer day HYPE has given me some kind of fever, but as I see it: United pay 6M upfront (peanuts), don’t have to pay all of his berserk wages, have an option to release him after 12 months (or earlier one assumes) if he gets crocked again. Insane piece of top, top dealing from the lads there. What on earth are Monaco thinking?” What’s a Dutch breakfast? A euphemism, one automatically assumes. 6.04pm BST There are one or two reports doing the rounds that Danny Welbeck, stationed as he has been at Arsenal’s training ground with England, is rather keen on staying there on a longer-term basis. We’re keeping our ears to the ground. It’s all about Welbeck, now. 6.02pm BST Newcastle’s Ben Arfa stand-off intensifies! This just in from our own Louise Taylor: “Newcastle United are desperately attempting to offload Hatem Ben Arfa tonight; Alan Pardew seemingly instructed his board ‘to do whatever it takes’. But Ben Arfa wants to stay. “They are unlikely to sign a defensive replacement for the Roma bound Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa.” 6.00pm BST Arsenal stirring after all? Arsenal made a late offer for William Carvalho. Too short. — Gonçalo Lopes (@_GoncaloLopes) September 1, 2014 Hmmm. Nice of them to give us something. Anything. 5.59pm BST David Henen a rompu son contrat à Anderlecht et va signer à l'Olympiacos — Christophe Franken (@ChristFranken) September 1, 2014 This tweet from a Belgian journalist, if it is borne out, suggests that teenage prospect Henen has jilted Everton at the altar and gone for a Greek wedding. 5.55pm BST Sky are now linking John Guidetti with a loan move to Palermo, who need a striker after Abel Hernandez left for Hull. Always feel a faint, slightly intangible tinge of regret about Guidetti and it would be good to see such a gifted player get his career back on track. 5.53pm BST This is for you, Manchester United fans: #Falcao's top 20 goals ever: https://t.co/0ZYcziGytv Not bad. — Paul Campbell (@campbellwpaul) September 1, 2014 5.51pm BST Jason Puncheon will be staying at Crystal Palace, says Sky’s man on the scene, a big relief to the various Beckenham ne’erdowells gathered behind him who had been biting their nails about their man being linked with nobody whatsoever. Updated at 5.51pm BST 5.49pm BST Slightly surprised #MCFC willing to go down to three strikers, especially with Aguero's occasional injury issues. — Daniel Taylor (@DTguardian) September 1, 2014 Danny refers to Manchester City’s imminent letting-go of Alvaro Negredo, whose star has fallen quite a distance since his outstanding form of last autumn. See, Arsenal aren’t the only ones... 5.47pm BST “Do you have any insights at all why Arsenal might have passed on Falcao? Was it a money thing or did AFC never have any intention of betting anyone?” asks Sam Hankins. Well, money will be a big factor. Whether on loan or permanent, Falcao isn’t coming cheap and that’s before his tax-free wage at Monaco. It’s also for a player who has only just come back from a very nasty injury. In fact, we might wait and see how any medical at Manchester United goes before we make definitive judgments here. It’s notable that Real Madrid, for example, went for the cheaper (and, admittedly, probably happier to benchwarm) Chicharito instead. I also think Arsenal were caught very cold by the Giroud injury. 5.43pm BST Remember David Ngog? David Ngog. Remember him?

We have completed the transfer of Benjamin Stambouli from Montpellier. #WelcomeBenji pic.twitter.com/jrjwhU3J0T — Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) September 1, 2014 And this Welbeck stuff just isn’t going away either. It’s probably dependent on Falcao getting sorted. 5.38pm BST “A fascinating day at Turf Moor,” says Peter Stevenson at Burnley. Nathaniel Chalobah is a big draw these days. Nothing in a move for Bolton’s Mark Davies, we’re told. 5.37pm BST That Tranmere signing – revealed! Tranmere Rovers have completed the signing of striker George Donnelly from Rochdale for an undisclosed fee pic.twitter.com/zCpfNMOwAI — Tranmere Rovers FC (@tranmererovers) September 1, 2014 I don’t have a lot to say about that, but if you do then you’ve got the email address. 5.35pm BST There I was being all clever and finding Ostersunds clips for you, but Swansea have actually done something else: Jose Canas, little more than a squad player last season, has joined Espanyol. 5.33pm BST Royston Drenthe drinking beer and going crazy driving his Ferrari The title says it all. Thanks to Nicholas Brookes for this. Just what a Championship dressing room is crying out for. 5.31pm BST Admir Pajic is an Arsenal fan who doesn’t take things too seriously. They exist. “Wouldn’t it be a great thing if Arsenal sign Carlos Bacca from Sevilla and than re-sign Chu Young Park so we can have Chu-Bacca in attack next to Yar-Yar Sanogo Binks?” he chuckles. “At least we can joke about our problems.” 5.29pm BST I’m sitting there, thinking that Charlie Nicholas’ jacket is beyond comprehension. ‘I love it when a plan comes together’ Photograph: Public domain Updated at 5.38pm BST 5.28pm BST “Any chance of a hint of a whisper of a shadow of a clue of a wild guess about anything Newcastle related?”, asks James Sprague. My Sky Sources have drawn a blank on that one. Anyone know any better? 5.26pm BST Sky have segued into knocking down straw men with Geraint Hughes outside Arsenal, so let’s watch some non-transfer-related football. That’s a thing, trust me. Here are our goals of the week – including a humdinger from Jeff Stans. 5.23pm BST If you were wondering what Premier League leaders Swansea are getting up to, the answer is “not much,” although Sky’s reporter appears to have been asking them to sell Wilfred Bony all day. They have, though, signed Gambian striker Modou Barrow from Swedish side second-tier side Ostersunds. I know nothing about him (although I did spend a decidedly bleak couple of days in Ostersund back in the spring of 2002), so let’s learn together: 5.18pm BST Sheffield Wednesday, meanwhile, have taken Royston Drenthe on loan from Reading. Don’t see that ending remotely badly. 5.16pm BST Sebastian Coates has “gone back to Liverpool to get his stuff,” now. I’m checking my pulse. 5.15pm BST Sky Sources have now told them, in strictest and most exclusive confidence, that news about Morgan Amalfitano. 5.14pm BST News from Southampton, where Atletico Madrid defender Toby Alderweireld and Red Bull Salzburg midfielder Sadio Mane, who has a quite phenomenal career scoring record, are both having medicals – so says Sky’s Roger Clarke. Updated at 5.18pm BST 5.12pm BST “What film is Jack Wilshere watching? The Arsenal Stadium Transfer Mystery?”, asks Joseph Surtees, innocently. 5.08pm BST Christian Purslow, ex-Liverpool MD, is talking on Sky about Falcao – pointing out that matching his tax-free salary at Monaco, if we’re talking net earnings, would take the kind of wage as yet not seen in this country. He is now sticking up for Ed Woodward. Updated at 5.09pm BST 5.05pm BST If Villa sign Sergio Canales, perhaps he’ll do things like this: 5.03pm BST David Wall emails in: “How smug must Liverpool be feeling right now? Not only have they conducted some (on the face of it) pretty decent transfer business and mostly done so early in the summer to avoid the panic today, they’ve obviously provided inspiration for the approach that traditional rivals United are going to adopt this season. Clearly someone at Old Trafford saw how well Liverpool’s ‘forget about decent defence we’ll just try to out-score the opponents’ tactics worked last season and the aim is to follow suit. Perhaps their focus shifted to the World Cup a little early though, they seem to have missed how that approach stood up at the real business end of the season down at Selhurst Park.” How smug must they be feeling, indeed? The floor is yours. 5.00pm BST Real Madrid have unveiled Chicharito: #BienvenidoChicharito #HalaMadrid pic.twitter.com/MxAldVK3o2 — Real Madrid C. F. (@realmadrid) September 1, 2014 These hashtags are the most important thing about Deadline Day. 4.56pm BST To prepare you for Matt Smith’s British record move to Fulham, this is an interesting interview Jacob Steinberg did with him last year. Updated at 4.59pm BST 4.54pm BST An email from Conor O’Kane: “Falcao is probably going to score hatloads, but he wasn’t needed and I’d have preferred something to have been done to address the number of run outs Tyler Blackett and your lad Keane are getting. They should be getting shipped off to Preston, not starting for United.” Then they, too, would be one step on the way to starring in Danny Welbeck Deadline Day. 4.51pm BST Fulham have offered Bolton £13 million for Jermaine Beckford would like to sign Bolton’s Jermaine Beckford, and have offered Leeds £29 million for Matt Smith would like to sign Leeds’ Matt Smith. As well as Cardiff’s Mark Hudson. Good luck with the negotiations, Fulham. There’s a phrase somewhere involving being hoisted by one’s own petard. 4.47pm BST More soul food from Guardian colleagues, this time in the form of Football Weekly. Deadline day, Premier League and La Liga wit and wisdom for your earholes on the journey home. Updated at 4.59pm BST 4.44pm BST Atletico Madrid’s rebuild continues: . @ale_cerci_7 has passed the medical examination and has signed his contract http://t.co/W8ZLeLOUkj #WelcomeCerci pic.twitter.com/4q0o3uMFDM — Atleti English (@atletienglish) September 1, 2014 Nice hashtag. We knew this one was coming. But that’s a very good signing. Arsenal, too, had been linked. 4.42pm BST “It is obviously for charity,” Hayley McQueen benevolently offers of Arsène Wenger’s trip to Rome, offering transparently doubtful-sounding mitigation. Look, whether or not Arsenal have got the transfer window right or wrong, where Wenger is today makes no difference whatsoever. None! 4.40pm BST Arsenal fans, how are you feeling? Just asking. What an odd window for Wenger and company this has been. It all looked pretty good a month ago – you’d have said they perhaps needed one more on board, maybe a deep midfielder, but the early dealings had been sharp enough. Giroud’s injury was unlucky but, really, they now look a bit underdone and it feels like a wasted opportunity for them. 4.37pm BST The Fiver has landed. And if I were you I’d read it, before things get even more earnest over here. 4.33pm BST A deal resurrected from the dead! You thought you’d heard the last of Oussama Assaidi to Stoke? You thought wrong. This from the indefatigable Andy Hunter has sailed into my inbox: “Oussama Assaidi on loan to Stoke City appears to be back on. His OTT wage demands had jeopardised a return to the Britannia Stadium from Liverpool but may be a compromise to get that deal through.” 4.31pm BST Jamie Redknapp on Sky with more: “I don’t think Jermain’s idea is to go back [to Toronto],” before launching into one about how Defoe could be decent for ‘Arry. Not so sure about the etiquette of that. There’s a lot of “I’m sure my dad will think...”, “I’m sure he will be happy with...”. This is not a patch on the car window, but it might as well be the car window. 4.27pm BST “Danny Welbeck is the name on everyone’s lips,” says Sky’s Jamie Weir at Spurs. And it’s going to be true, isn’t it? We’ve had our Falcao fun. We’re in for six and a half hours of Welbeck pingpong, now, before he ends up back at Sunderland. Meanwhile: “I know my dad would like to sign him,” says Jamie Redknapp of Sandro, apparently sought by QPR. Like father, like son. 4.24pm BST West Ham news – Morgan Amalfitano to sign We understand that Morgan Amalfitano, the Marseille midfielder who spent last season at West Brom, is to be the latest member of Big Sam’s Footballing Revolution. Three-year deal for the Frenchman. 4.21pm BST “Regarding Tranmere’s striker who is “in the building” (16:02)- I guess that rules out former Leicester striker Elvis Hammond at least,” quips Rich Harland. Very good. Hammond, because you definitely weren’t wondering, is now with Kingstonian. I know this because a friend of mine is nuts about the Ks and recently sent me this example of this recent work. 4.15pm BST Jack Wilshere is in a cinema at the moment, says David Garrido. 4.14pm BST Neil Warnock’s arrival at Crystal Palace has been a bit of a gamechanger for today, hasn’t it? James McArthur seems to have been rescued from the confines of that Range Rover, should you have been worried, and is expected to join in that club-record deal today, and Spurs’ Zeki Fryers should follow. A striker – Gary Hooper? Chris Wood? – should be next. Updated at 4.38pm BST 4.12pm BST This is what you’ve got, Hull fans: No, I’m not sure why “CSKA News” either. 4.09pm BST Abel Hernandez joins Hull... The Uruguay striker, previously of Palermo, arrived on a three-year deal, greeted by a going-through-the-motions cheer by the various layabouts stationed behind Sky’s correspondent. 4.08pm BST But things have now got serious where our Radamel is concerned, and here’s Danny Taylor to unpick it all for you. Read his excellent piece on what his arrival will mean for United and their formation. 4.06pm BST Remember when we could look at Falcao from a nice, objective distance and delight in his gifts? And then use him as our muse for some quirky, occasionally slightly subversive pieces of artwork? Remember September 2012? 4.02pm BST It’s not only Sky who are coy... The Club has agreed a transfer fee for a striker, he is in the building... — Tranmere Rovers FC (@tranmererovers) September 1, 2014 The old teases. I’m guessing Danny Welbeck. Thanks to a rapt David Penfold for this heads-up. 3.57pm BST “I’m told by my Sky sources...” is a popular buzzphrase today. Forfeit if Sky aren’t mentioned? Gripping viewing on my Guardian computer. 3.55pm BST Chelsea loaning out a player? I know, I know, but here’s Andy... Burnley have signed Chelsea midfielder Nathaniel Chalobah on loan until January. — Andy Hunter (@AHunterGuardian) September 1, 2014 That’s what, 20? 21 loanees from Chelsea now and we’re only in the first day of September? But it’s also a rant for another day. Decent punt on Chalobah from Burnley though, was underwhelming at Forest last season but excellent at Watford and has the talent to make it further up. 3.51pm BST Borini to QPR update from Andy Hunter – looks as if it could be on “Liverpool have agreed a fee of £10m plus add-ons with QPR for Fabio Borini. Now up to the player to decide, or accept, that his days as a Liverpool player are over.” 3.51pm BST West Ham targeting a second player, says Sky’s Paul Wright. They do keep on with this mystery-player lark, don’t they? 3.50pm BST Southampton update from Danny Taylor: Possible hitch for Southampton with Sporting Lisbon winger Diego Capel. Parma trying to get involved. — Daniel Taylor (@DTguardian) September 1, 2014 Have always liked Capel – he was brilliant for Sevilla around 2007/2008-ish. Never quite fulfilled his potential since but would be interesting to see him in the Premier League. 3.43pm BST Sky’s Keith Downie tells us that Sunderland’s club photographer has been to take photographs of new boy Sebastian Coates in the last hour or so, and promptly gone again. Nicely efficient work from the snapper, and more forensic detail than ever from Sky. Downie also says Sunderland are not, despite reports, in for Stoke’s Geoff Cameron – but he’s dangled the possibiliy of a late move for a forward in front of us so on we hang, in helpless thrall. 3.40pm BST Lower down the leagues, Jon Obika has joined Swindon on a two-year deal from Spurs. That’s no Falcao, but it must feel rather strange for Obika: nearly 24, he “enjoyed” no fewer than ELEVEN loan spells (four at Yeovil!) during his time at White Hart Lane. Updated at 3.40pm BST 3.33pm BST Is something stirring at Liverpool? And, indeed, Loftus Road? An email has arrived from my colleague Andy Hunter: “The price of having a productive summer and getting deals done early is to feel like a spare part on deadline day but (and it is only a but at this stage) something may be stirring at Liverpool. Fabio Borini, who has resisted all efforts to move to Sunderland for £14m this summer, is in talks with QPR and could end up at Loftus Road providing Harry Redknapp doesn’t opt for Jermain Defoe instead.” 3.30pm BST Interestingly, says Sky’s man at Palace, James McArthur has spent an hour and a half sitting in his agent’s Range Rover. Why isn’t he having a medical, he wonders? Hopefully someone will come and rescue McArthur, as it doesn’t sound very safe – although it’s not a particularly hot day and hopefully he has a bottle of water handy. Further transport news: Owen Garvan has left Palace’s training ground in a taxi. Big fare up to Bolton from there, but they seem the frontrunners for the Irishman’s signature. 3.27pm BST And now they’re talking about tennis, which seems rather noble. The big news of this particular moment continues to be Canales to Villa. 3.24pm BST Sky seem to have their own fallout room for dealing with tonight’s repercussions. David Garrido has just given us a tour of it, while blitzing us over-familiarly with names we’re to hold closely to our bosoms this evening. It’s like the bad guy’s lair from a Bond film, although I’m not sure there are any dead volcanoes in Osterley. 3.21pm BST This totaliser ain’t listening Updated at 3.37pm BST 3.18pm BST Let’s start our hours together with news of a possible non-transfer. Suggestion has it that Leicester don’t fancy taking their interest in Ipswich striker David McGoldrick much further, having seen the Suffolk side – who are apparently looking for £7m or £8m play some serious hardball during negotiations. If you want my opinion – and I know you’ve not solicited it – they should pay what Ipswich want. It’s stupid money but Leicester have played their full part in this transfer window’s egregiousness by spending £8m on Leonardo Ulloa (as well as he played yesterday). McGoldrick is better than him, and better than Ross McCormack too, so it’s best they play the market they’ve helped create. There. Now we can carry on. 3.11pm BST Barry has gone off to eat his deadline day cake, which you’d assume is crammed with E-numbers. Anyway, how’s it all going for you? 3.03pm BST OK, that’s all from me. Thanks for ytour company, your time and your emails. I’m off to lie down in a darkened room possibly via an ale house, but will leave you in the capable hands of Mr Nick Ames, who is sitting beside me champing at the metaphorical transfer deadline day bit. Enjoy the rest of the day, although I appreciate that if you’re an Arsenal fan that might be difficult. 3.00pm BST Sensational news: Aston Villa have made a bid for Real Sociedad midsfielder Sergio Canales. Real Sociedad’s Sergio Canales (foreground) could be on his way to Aston Villa.

A few miles south, Keith Downie is standing outside Sunderland’s training ground, where some older boys with neat side-partings, who are probably on their way to register for university courses, are standing a respectful distance behind him with their hands by their sides, listening intently. Make of that what you will. Updated at 3.13pm BST 2.52pm BST Lassanna Diarra news: Lassanna Diarra’s mooted move from Lokomotiv Moscow to QPR has collapsed. I know not why, but it ain’t gonna happen. 2.50pm BST More possibly inaccurate popular culture references: “Having lived in Sunderland for a stint, your opening with ‘More News from Sunderland’ for some reason reminded me of this,” writes Duncan Smith. “For the record, I have been successfully rehabilitated back into normal society.” Updated at 2.50pm BST 2.48pm BST @bglendenning As a Norwich fan we are only permitted crumbs from the transfer cake. — Rob (@robjg) September 1, 2014 2.46pm BST Oh for crying out loud! Tim the Reni hat pedant has been exposed as a charlatan and a know-nothing fraud. @bglendenning Reni was the drummer not the bass player, that was Mani — Graham Booth (@RomfordReject) September 1, 2014 2.42pm BST Interesting transfer news: Stoke City want to rescue Scott Sinclair from Manchester City and Ron Vlaar is not leaving Aston Villa if his manager Paul Lambert has anything to do with it. 2.41pm BST Rennie Hats v Reni Hats: “I’m enjoying your coverage, as ever,” writes Tim. “By the way, Reni hats were named after Alan ‘Reni’ Wren bass player from the Stone Roses rather than the eponymous indigestion aid. You know this, I’m sure!” I was aware of that, Tim. Not even my finger is that far away from the pulse. Reni’s Reni hat. Photograph: Kevin Cummins/Getty Images 2.37pm BST Weird Southampton news: Saphir Taïder, who arrived on loan at Saint Mary’s from Inter just last month has been sent back to his parent club. “Southampton Football Club can confirm that it has agreed to terminate midfielder Saphir Taïder’s loan spell,” reads a stetaement on the club website. “The midfielder joined Saints for the 2014/15 campaign but, having failed to live up to the high levels of commitment expected of Southampton players, that arrangement has been cut short by the club. Taïder, whose only first-team appearance came in the friendly against Bayer 04 Leverkusen last month, now returns to parent club Inter Milan. Dani Osvaldo’s loan arrangement with the Italian side is unaffected.” It’s believed that Taïderwas unhappy at not being guaranteed a first team spot. The bold type in the quote above was added by me, I hasten to add. 2.32pm BST More news from Sunderland: “Modibo Diakite has had his contract cancelled,” writes Louise Taylor. “A Roberto De Fanti/Paolo Di Canio production last summer, the former Lazio defender is now expected to join Fiorentina.” Sunderland’s Modibo Diakite is now just Modibo Diakite, but may soon be known as Fiorentina’s Modibo Diakite.

With Wigan Athletic. 2.22pm BST More from Jamie Jackson: Wigan should complete the signing of Brentford midfielder Adam Forshaw,” he says, tapping his nose and winking conspiratorially. 2.15pm BST Rennie hat-wearing Guardian Manchester football correspondent Jamie Jackson writes: “Am told that Richard Dunne is going to Burnley, Mo Diame is having a medical at Hull City and Russell Martin wants to stay at Norwich despite Burnley interest,” he says. 2.14pm BST Zenit made the best and most surprising signing of the day! #DeadlineDay pic.twitter.com/X1GMIVgMPu — Toke Møller Theilade (@TokeTheilade) September 1, 2014 Zenit St Petersburg sign Bart Simpson: “FC Zenit and the 20th Century Fox have reached an agreement about Bart Simpson’s transfer to the Blue-White-Sky Blues!” shrieks the club’’s website. “The latest addition to the team has already arrived in St. Petersburg, passed his physical, signed his contract and had his first training session this morning with the rest of the team. “Bartholomew Jo Jo (Bart) Simpson first appeared onscreen in 1987 and because of this he has decided to take 87 as his number. The footballer arrived a few days ago at Pulkovo and went to the club’s office to meet with the general director of Zenit, Maksim Mitrofanov. Bart had his medical exam at the MMC SOGAZ department The Nevsky Corinthia Palace, went to Petrovksy, the new store “Zenit Arena” and then made his way out to Udelny Park. “Andrè Villas-Boas immediately invited the newcomer to train with the team. Everyone immediately took to Bart and gave him a traditional welcoming. Additional details about the visit are at Zenit-TV. The latest addition to the mascot squad is expected soon make his debut at Petrovksy with our lion. FC Zenit welcomes Bart Simpson to St. Petersburg and wishes him and his family the best in their new family and squad!” Zenit fans are notoriously fussy about the skin colour of their players, so it will be interesting to see whether or not they can warm to a player who is yellow. 2.09pm BST Louise Taylor writes from up north: “Sunderland’s un-loved Valentin Roberge is on the brink of a season long loan move to Reims while Newcastle United’s similarly overlooked defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa looks set for a similar loan to Roma,” she reveals. “Meanwhile Newcastle’s Hatem Ben Arfa has - surprise, surprise - turned down a mooted loan move to Birmingham which was surely a not so subtle move to smoke out any interest in Alan Pardew’s favourite player. Despite some talk of Jermain Defoe moving to Tyneside there appear no definite in-comings to St James’ Park just yet. Down the road at Sunderland the imminent arrivals of Ricardo Alvarez and Sebastian Coates (detailed in earlier posts) could prove the last additions to Gus Poyet’s squads - although Sunderland are very keen to move the unwanted striker Danny Graham out.” I had completely forgotten that Danny Graham was still at Sunderland. 2.04pm BST @bglendenning You left your phone at home on transfer deadline day! Jim White would ask for the cake back if he knew! — Mark Matthews (@PragueBanjo) September 1, 2014 A fair point well made, here, but it’s not like Jorge Mendes would be ringing me every two minutes to give me the exclusive skinny on all his biggest clients. 2.00pm BST Sky Sports News take their eye off the ball briefly: They show interviews with England cricket coach Peter Moores and top tennis player Andy Murray, who are not footballers and unlikely to sign anything more interesting than an autograph for anyone today. Neither are asked for thoughts on which central midfielder or striker Arsene Wenger, who is in Rome today, should sign for Arsenal, so they just blather on about cricket and tennis respectively. For those Gunners fans among you who are concerned that Arsenal’s manager is spending deadline day gadding about Rome, Sky’s man outside their training ground, Geraint Hughes, has gone to great lengths to point out that the Arsenal manager has a phone and is easily contactable. But what if he forgot his phone? Too implausible a scenario, I reckon. Only a complete moron would leave his phone at home on deadline day. Updated at 2.01pm BST 1.55pm BST Pssst! Pssst! A colleague who shall remain nameless has just g-chatted me the following tidbit:“Hi mate, been told Southampton have rejected Tottenham’s latest bid for Jay Rodriguez.

A sweet, crumbly, icing-covered rubicon. Photograph: theguardian.com 1.47pm BST An email from Enna Cooper about Sky Sports reporter Roger Clarke’s brush with death: “Can we be sure that it was actually a Parcel Force driver in that Parcel Force van?” he asks. “Were the windows of the van open? Perhaps it was Harry Redknapp attempting a drive-by deadline-day interview. This would probably also be a convenient moment to me a joke about Redknapp and packages wrapped in brown paper bags, but I won’t lower to myself to that level.” 1.42pm BST Peter Cech news: Bad news for the Chelsea goalkeeper, who it seems will not be the subject of a bid from PSG today. 1.41pm BST Transfer Deadline Day cake excitement reaches fever pitch @bglendenning SHOW US THE CAKE!!! — John O' D (@shotsyjr) September 1, 2014 I’ve been getting a lot of these.

David reveals that Hatem Ben Arfa has just left training. You heard this sensational second hand news here first: a man has gone home from work. 1.31pm BST Sky Sports News reporter Roger Clarke may never know how close he just came to being knocked down by a Parcel Force van that looked certain to reverse into him as he stood outside Southampton’s training ground telling us that Morgan Schneiderlin definitely won’t be signing for Tottenham Hotspur. Luckily, the driver seems to have caught sight of the intrepid reporter before barreling into him. 1.27pm BST Chicharito Hernández, nuevo jugador del Real Madrid http://t.co/UDH8nN7DvN #BienvenidoChicharito #HalaMadrid pic.twitter.com/NqQyFEkaOF — Real Madrid C.

According to Geraint Hughes, who is loitering outside the Arsenal training ground with a group of Arsenal-supporting Junior Gooners jumping up and down across the street behind him, they may not be after a striker any more now that Radamel Falcao is on his way to Manchester United. Dainton dismisses rumours linking Jermaine Defoe with a move to the Emirates as rubbish, but says the club are interested in signing Ron Vlaar from Aston Villa and/or Matija Nastasic from Manchester City. It seems rumours of Jermain Defoe’s imminent move to Arsenal have been greatly exaggerated. Photograph: Pete Norton/Getty Images Updated at 1.19pm BST 1.10pm BST Good afternoon everybody.

I’ve just returned from recording today’s episode of our Football Weekly podcast to discover a gift has arrived in the office for me. It’s a black box with a yellow ribbon that has “Happy Transfer Deadline Day” on it in the Sky Sports News yellow ticker style. It also has a Jim White gift tag and the box contains a slice of cake boasting a shirt-and-yellow-tie combo. And to think some people think Sky are a wee bit over-zealous in their coverage of transfer deadline day, eh? Anyway, cake is cake, so I’m not going to grumble. Thanks, Sky. 1.04pm BST Handing over to Barry Glendenning now. Enjoy! 1.03pm BST You wanted crying footballers? Here are some crying footballers. (Hat tip: Chris Zammarelli) This one is hard to beat, to be fair (as suggested by Joe Mackertich) Updated at 1.07pm BST 1.01pm BST Some guy has just tweeted Sky saying he’s actually taken the day off work to watch Sky Sports News. Really?! REALLY? Needless to say the Sky presenters are positively beaming at that. I thought everyone just goes to work and has a sneaky tab open on their browsers/pretends they are sending important work emails from their phone. 12.56pm BST Oh here we go then … I've just seen the boss....looks bang in negotiation mode \uD83D\uDC4C — Rio Ferdinand (@rioferdy5) September 1, 2014 12.54pm BST “Don’t forget the lower leagues!” reminds James Liu. “Marine FC set to sign Southport youth player Shafi Anwar on a permanent deal” YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST! 12.51pm BST Do get in contact with your favourite footballing cry-ers. Valbuena was in a bit of a state when he left Marseille this summer, for example. Doesn’t have to be strictly press-conference crying, of course. 12.47pm BST Can’t imagine he’s going to turn on the waterworks for leaving Monaco, but Falcao traditionally loves a good cry, look at him when he left Atletico! As mentioned in Classic YouTube, earlier this year when the striker was on the sidelines he went to a meet-and-greet with some young Colombian fans. Boy gets overwhelmed. Boy cries hysterically. Boy tries to heal Falcao’s knee (we think). Falcao cries. Actually quite a tender moment. 12.28pm BST Here’s confirmation of Marco van Ginkel’s loan move from Chelsea to Milan. Includes the line: “A lot of Dutch players have played in this great club, big names. I’m just happy to be finally here. I spoke to [Milan’s Dutch international] Nigel de Jong and he told me very good things about this club.” Doesn’t sound like De Jong is going anywhere then. 12.24pm BST Another loan! Expecting announcement from Southampton later about loan deal for Sporting Lisbon winger Diego Capel. Told it's 'almost done' — Daniel Taylor (@DTguardian) September 1, 2014 12.16pm BST Stat attack: There have already been more than half a million Tweets and counting related to Falcao since #DeadlineDay began at midnight. Since the window opened on July 1st, the ongoing rumours that have been most-discussed by fans on Twitter are: 1) Arturo Vidal 2) Sami Khedira 3) Marco Reus 4) Radamel Falcao 5) Mats Hummels 6) Edison Cavani 7) Daley Blind 12.10pm BST North-east football correspondent Louise Taylor has been in contact with some Sunderland news: Sunderland’s South American contingent is set to increase with the imminent arrivals of Ricardo Alavrez and Sebastian Coates. Alvarez, a 26-year-old Argentina left winger or playmaker, is moving from Internazionale on a season long loan with a view to a permanent £9m transfer next summer and is earmarked for the left sided attacking role in Gus Poyet’s 4-1-4-1 formation. Coates, meanwhile, is a compatriot of Poyet. Indeed Sunderland’s manager was so keen to acquire the 23-year-old Liverpool central defender - whose progress at Anfield was slowed by a serious knee injury - for the coming year that he is understood to have told his board to pursue the Uruguayan ahead of the now Fiorentina bound Micah Richards. Read the full story here. Updated at 12.26pm BST 12.08pm BST That’s the spirit Tom! @michaelbutler18 FALCAO FALCAO FALCAO FALCAO. Still terrified about the defence but too excited to care anymore. #DeadlineDay — Tom Saggers (@Saggerst) September 1, 2014 His goalscoring record is magnificent. Porto: 72 goals in 87 apps Atletico: 70 goals in 91 apps Monaco: 13 goals in 22 apps. Only 22 apps for Monaco! It’s tough to pick the best one – these two bicycle kicks aren’t half bad – but personally I’d stump for this effort against Barcelona at the Camp Nou. Dink-tastic golazo. Updated at 12.19pm BST 12.00pm BST “Amidst the entirely necessary commotion to sign a striker, I’d like to morosely remind Arsenal fans that we are no closer to signing a central defender, another of our top priorities” emails Bharath Ganesh. Remember Arsenal have made an enquiry for Matija Nastasic, and are rumoured to be interested in Aston Villa captain Ron Vlaar, although the player’s agent has said he’s be staying in the Midlands. 11.56am BST Danny Welbeck is well up for Tottenham. Here’s Jamie Jackson’s story on that. 11.52am BST Fear not Arsenal fans, Wenger is on the move! Maybe he wants Gervinho back?!

Loan deal first for FFP reasons? — Guillem Balague (@GuillemBalague) September 1, 2014 Manchester United do have the option to purchase Falcao at the end of the season but would be very surprised if United have already signed off on a permanent deal, particularly with the Colombian’s injury record. 11.40am BST BREAKING: Luis Suarez is at Liverpool’s training ground! The Uruguayan is set to sign his autograph, pick up some luggage that he left behind and rub in the fact that he no longer plays for them. Sorry for getting your hopes up there.

Seems to be true … Lewis Holtby is in Hamburg for a medical and, to be fair, he looks pretty chuffed about it... http://t.co/xc0zsqMiYp pic.twitter.com/hSvdyH07VL — Who Ate All The Pies (@waatpies) September 1, 2014 Updated at 12.33pm BST 11.29am BST Anerudh Athrey on the email. “I’m not sure if I have missed something, but given that AS Monaco are in the Champions league this season and have already lost James Rodriguez to Real Madrid, why haven’t they shown more interest in keeping hold of Falcao ? Is it because of FFP?” It is definitely a little strange, if they don’t reinvest that money, even with Berbatov up top, you would think PSG would walk to the Ligue 1 title. I watched Monaco miserably lose a few weeks back at home to Lorient. They were awful. Updated at 11.29am BST 11.17am BST Read here for the full story on Falcao’s loan move to Manchester United. 11.17am BST More domino-based chat. “If Van Ginkel moves to Milan then I suppose De Jong will come to Man United?,” emails/begs Fraser Duguid. “Finally, somebody who can pass the ball to Falcao when he comes. No offence Cleverley.” Despite the arrival of Herrera, United could definitely do with another central midfielder. Not implausible to see him joining the Dutch mafia at Old Trafford. Updated at 11.18am BST 11.13am BST All hail the Transfer Deadline Day Domino Effect. Falcao’s arrival has already shunted Javier Hernandez off to Real Madrid for a medical, and another of United’s peripheral players, Danny Welbeck, surely won’t be long in getting the hell outta Dodge. Jamie Jackson has been in contact to say that Spurs are leading the race to sign the England striker, on loan apparently. Radamel Falcao: Old Trafford-bound. Photograph: Jean Christophe Magnenet/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 11.20am BST 11.06am BST Hello all. Phew! It’s been a breathless start to THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY OF THE YEAR. First up, The Guardian’s Andy Hunter has been in touch with some hot Liverpool chat. Galatasaray and Napoli want Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva but both have only offered a loan deal so far. Liverpool would prefer a permanent transfer but unlikely to stand in Lucas’s way if he accepts a loan to Naples or Istanbul. 11.00am BST Michael Butler will be taking over the live blog now. Be nice. 10.54am BST Mohamed Diame's move from West Ham United to Hull City looks likely to go through today. — Stuart James (@StuartJamesGNM) September 1, 2014 10.53am BST “Stoke City had not anticipated doing anything on deadline day but Peter Odemwingie’s serious knee injury has thrown a spanner in the works,” Stuart James says. “They’re now desperately trying to bring in a winger. Aaron Lennon, the Spurs wide man, is one option. Oussama Assaidi, who was on loan from Liverpool last season, is another. Stoke had a permanent deal for Assaidi agreed with Liverpool but I’m told the player’s wage demands were ridiculous and prevented it from going through. Unless Assaidi drops what he is asking for, Stoke think another loan is the only option. In other Stoke news, Jack Butland, the England Under-21 goalkeeper, will go out on loan again. They are happy for him to join a Championship club but only if he is guaranteed first-team action.” 10.42am BST Micah Richards has touched down in Florence... 10.35am BST Karim El-Ahmadi has re-joined Feyernoord from Aston Villa. 10.33am BST Stoke keen on winger in wake of Odemwingie injury. Assaidi on radar - deal previously agreed with Liverpool but wage demands stopped it. — Stuart James (@StuartJamesGNM) September 1, 2014 10.32am BST The loan fee for Falcao will be £6m. He is yet to agree wages with United. 10.29am BST “With United getting Falcao from Monaco I trust Rooney is going the other way,” says Mark Judd. 10.24am BST Here’s a picture of Javier Hernandez at Real Madrid. It's medical time for Javier Hernandez at Real Madrid pic.twitter.com/SoMiPaqpxk — 101 Great Goals (@102greatgoals) September 1, 2014 10.23am BST “Six clubs have inquired about James Milner in the last two weeks but the England international will definitely not be leaving Manchester City in this transfer window,” writes Stuart James. “City and Milner’s representatives have recently held further talks with City about a new contract, although no financial terms have been discussed and there is little sign of any progress. At this stage, Milner’s main concerns are the lack of first-team action – he was a peripheral figure last season and has played only 12 minutes of Premier League football so far this term. With less than 12 months remaining on his contract, Milner is in a strong position. City, however, have no desire to cash-in on him before the window closes tonight. Equally, Milner does not believe it would be in his interests to move now.” 10.21am BST “I can only presume that, given his solidity in the air, Falcao is being brought in to give some added strength to our three man defence,” says Wilf Waterhouse. As if United need any more defenders. 10.16am BST In the big news of the day, Crystal Palace are going to sign James McCarthy McArthur from Wigan for a club-record £7m. 10.12am BST Manchester United have agreed a loan deal for Radamel Falcao, subject to a medical. Bloody hell. Didn't wake up today expecting that. #falcao — Daniel Taylor (@DTguardian) September 1, 2014 Updated at 10.13am BST 10.10am BST It seems that Milan have signed Marco van Ginkel from Chelsea. 10.03am BST “Obviously tempting fate here but deadline day may not be quite so manic on Merseyside this time,” says our Merseyside correspondent Andy Hunter. “Republic of Ireland defender Shane Duffy is joining Blackburn Rovers from Everton for £1.5m and Roberto Martinez could make a final signing in the window, despite investing heavily in Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto’o’s wages, though it’s not Stoke City defender Ryan Shawcross. “Liverpool are not expected to bring anyone else in today. To be fair, they have signed nine this summer. Sebastian Coates is close to joining Sunderland on a season-long loan and, despite all being told they can go, Fabio Borini, Lucas Leiva, Ossuama Assaidi and Suso have gone nowhere yet.” 10.02am BST “Zeki Fryers ‘already at Beckenham’,” says Dan Johnson. “Are we live blogging his train journey from Tottenham? Only a couple more stops to go…” 9.54am BST “I was getting all excited about the slim chance of arsenal signing a world class forward but you’ve ruined that with all your “facts”,” says Ben Lake. “I hope you’re happy with yourself. This really raises the question of why we didn’t sign Remy on the cheap? Surely he would have preffered to lead the line for Arsenal than sit on the bench for Chelsea.” I’m not sure if Wenger is a huge fan of Remy. Updated at 9.58am BST 9.45am BST “Looks as if James McArthur will cost Crystal Palace a club record £7m, the same figure Wigan agreed with Leicester City before they opted instead to secure Esteban Cambiasso,” says Dominic Fifield. “There had been suggestions over the weekend that Palace might send Adlene Guedioura the other way, with the finer details of the deal still to be finalised. Talks continue with Tottenham Hotspur over Zeki Fryers, whom Palace had initially hoped to secure on loan but may now have to sign permanently. But the young left-back is apparently already at Beckenham in anticipation of the completion of that move to south London.” Wigan’s James McArthur.

One Hour Behind: Welcome Di María & Blind http://t.co/YtptH7s3SM / Bienvenidos Di María y Blind http://t.co/TpVWOjRmkA — Juan Mata García (@juanmata8) September 1, 2014 9.31am BST There has been interest in Arsenal from Ron Vlaar but word is he is happy at Aston Villa for the time being. Southampton are digging their heels in over Jay Rodriguez but wouldn’t mind signing Andros Townsend. And Glenn Murray will leave Crystal Palace if they nab Gary Hooper from Norwich. 9.28am BST “I have just had a word with the other 1,056 and surely Nastasic would be a good signing for either Tottingham or Arsenal rather than for both?” parps Duncan Smith. “Unless he stays in London and just plays for whoever is at home that week.” 9.21am BST Here’s some more on Micah Richards, who is heading to Fiorentina on loan, from Danny Taylor. West Ham were in for him but there was a loan fee and quite high wages. There was been interest from Sunderland and earlier in the summer Newcastle. He is the longest serving player at City but has had injuries and turned down new contract at the end of last season because he wanted to restart his career. Micah Richards: set to be cooling himself off in Florence shortly. Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images Updated at 9.56am BST 9.20am BST One for Watford fans reeling from the departure of Beppe Sanino by the way: they have been talking to the former Brighton manager Oscar Garcia about the vacancy. Updated at 9.28am BST 9.16am BST “Are there any news on a Van Ginkel move to Milan?” says Konstantin Sauer. “I’d rather keep him with Chelsea if compatible with allowed number of foreign players. There aren’t too many central midfielders left in the squad.” He’s close to joining Milan but it hasn’t been confirmed yet. And Chelsea have Fabregas, Matic, Ramires and Mikel. Updated at 9.21am BST 9.14am BST Some things to think about when it comes to paying such a high fee for Radamel Falcao: he’s almost 29 and he’s had three knee operations in his career. The problem could be his wages. He could end up being the highest paid player in the league if he moves to England and that would be a big risk for a player who, while clearly extremely talented, has had fitness problems. His is a game based on pace and aggression but would he be able to play with that sort of intensity in the most physically demanding league in the world after coming back from a cruciate ligament injury? Updated at 9.16am BST 9.05am BST Here’s today’s Rumour Mill. 9.02am BST Micah Richards is on his way to Florence to talk to Fiorentina about a loan with a view to a permanent transfer next summer, reports our chief football writer, Daniel Taylor. 8.55am BST If it was me making the decisions at Southampton, I’m not sure I’d accept Tottenham’s offer of cash plus Andros Townsend for Jay Rodriguez. Remember when everyone was so hyped about Townsend? We were so young, so naive. 8.49am BST Here’s Jamie’s story on Arsenal and Tottenham’s interest in Manchester City’s Matija Nastasic. He’d be a good signing for both, wouldn’t he? 8.47am BST “At long last, Newcastle have unearthed a little gem in Rolando Aarons,” says Rob Morgan. “Quick , direct , fearless , scores goals and only 18. The best to come through for years. So at some point today, Ashley will sell him.” 8.46am BST Could Micah Richards really be on his way to Fiorentina? 8.44am BST Apparently it’s “eerily quiet” at Upton Park today, even though I can hear passing cars in the background. 8.33am BST Get your Premier League talking points here! All your talking point needs here! 8.29am BST Jamie Jackson has been in touch with some news that will be of interest to Arsenal and Tottenham fans. He says that both clubs have made enquiries about the Manchester City defender Matija Nastasic. 8.25am BST It sounds like West Ham’s Mo Diame could be off today, with Hull a possible destination for the Senegalese midfielder. This puts a dent in my dream of Sam Allardyce one day fielding an entire team of defensive midfielders. 8.20am BST Arsenal still haven’t signed a striker. This is getting ridiculous. 8.16am BST Arsenal haven’t signed a striker yet. 8.04am BST I’ve just heard mention of Harry Redknapp. Which is just as well, because we arrived at work together this morning. Our man on the ground. Photograph: Public Domain 8.02am BST Neil Warnock has told TalkSport that he wants to bring four players to Crystal Palace today. I assume one of them is Paddy Kenny, his inspiration, his muse, the reason he gets up in the morning. Updated at 8.02am BST 8.02am BST “I love this day, don’t you absolutely love this day?” says Sky Sports Man. “I absolutely love it!” says Sky Sports Woman. 7.54am BST Oh Loic! How could you! 7.47am BST “Alan Curbishley, still with us ...” I was worried that the Sky presenter was going to continue by saying “still ... with ... us ... it’s been how long, Alan? Alan? How long have you been with us? It feels like it’s been for ever.” 7.45am BST My colleague, Dominic Fifield, recently a cover star in the Crystal Palace programme has been in touch. He says that Palace are looking at Zeki Fryers. Tyrone Mings, James McArthur and a striker, Chelsea are unlikely to do any business and it should be busy at QPR, with Aaron Lennon, Sandro and Jermain Defoe all potentially on their way to Loftus Road.

He’s still a Manchester United player. Nothing’s gone forward on that.” And here’s what Steve Bruce had to say about the chances of Cleverley going to Hull: “Everyone keeps writing about Cleverley but I can’t see it. I don’t think it will happen.” 7.28am BST Barry Glendenning has just arrived in the office - our very own Jim White - and has asked why there are already so many people here. “Is it deadline day?” he queries. 7.27am BST Excellent pronunciation on Sporting Gijon by Sky’s man in Glasgow. He really nailed the Hee-Hon. 7.24am BST I see that Atletico Madrid have signed Alessio Cerci from Torino. That’s one striker who won’t be going to Arsenal. 7.17am BST Alan Curbishley is in the Sky Sports News studio. He thinks that Radamel Falcao fits the bill for Arsenal. 7.15am BST It is far too early to be watching Sky Sports News. They’re all so happy and smiley and giddy. What’s wrong with these people? 6.30am BST Preamble Morning! It’s the most wonderful time of the year! Will Radamel Falcao move from one rich club to another rich club? Will Arsenal sign a striker? Will Arsenal sign a defensive midfielder? Will Arsenal sign some defensive cover? Will Arsenal sign a dainty creative midfielder? Will Manchester United sign a new defence and a new midfield? Will Tottenham sign Morgan Schneiderlin? Will Harry Redknapp sign Jermain Defoe for the 17th time in his career? Can a man go insane from watching too much Sky Sports News?

The menu is classic Italian cooking and every day there is also a list of the chef's suggestions offering simpler dishes like meatballs with artichokes. The general menu offers classic pasta like spaghetti alle vongole and in season they serve delicious tagliolini with white truffles and fresh funghi porcini. The fresh fish is chosen with care and prepared in all the traditional ways and the chef also has a masterly hand with the top quality meat. There is a good wine list and a reasonable house wine.

It is rather dark so it's best in the heat of summer or when the weather is bleak outside. The good varied menu combines Roman specialities like cacio e pepe (pasta with pecorino romano sheep cheese and black pepper) with interesting innovations like thin slices of crisp potato with cheese fonduta (fondue) and slivers of black truffles. The little aubergine timbales and specialities from other Italian regions are very good. There is an excellent wine list with fair prices and an unusually good selection of half bottles.

Today it is regarded as one of the best restaurants in the city. It is a place for special occasions with its elegant rooms and beautiful tableware. The menu is an exciting mixture of old and new. Many of the traditional Roman favourites are given a new twist, such as \"new style\" boneless oxtail with celeriac puree, and Angelo combines seasonal ingredients with panache in his new creations. This is great designer food and people are encouraged to order a series of half portions to create their own tasting menu. Most of the great wines are present on the wine list and Massimo is happy to suggest different glasses of wine to go with each dish ordered. • Vicolo dei Soldati 31, +39 06 686 9432, ilconviviotroiani.com.

This is a place to order family-style lasagna when available and then one of the prepared main dishes, although the grilled meat and fish are equally good. Vegetables in season are on the menu and there are a few homemade desserts. The wine list is small, but carefully chosen with fair prices.

In warmer months meals are served in the beautiful garden with its 300-year-old wisteria and Roman remains. The extensive menu satisfies all tastes and is a good mixture of traditional and new. There is excellent grilled meat served with a wide choice of sauces using olive oil from the Sabine hills, and the very fresh fish appears in an interesting way at every course. The antipasti selection ranges from cheese and salami to vegetables and seafood, while the very fertile area just south of Rome – the Ciociaria – inspires several pasta dishes. • L'Archeologia, Via Appia Antica 139, +39 06 788 0494, larcheologia.it.

In summer the tables are set out in the piazza and one can sit with a glass of wine enjoying the simple dishes of la cucina romana. The menu is short but most people come for the delicious cacio e pepe pasta, made with pecorino cheese and black pepper, served on a crisp shell of Parmigiano and the cozze alla marinara – mussels with garlic, chilli pepper and a hint of tomato. • Piazza di Santa Cecilia 24, +39 06 580 0757, romasparita.com.

A chilled glass cabinet stands at the entrance, hung with massive pieces of meat. There are many dishes on the menu but most customers choose the grilled beef, which can be accompanied by fagioli al fiasco, dressed with prize-winning olive oil, or thinly sliced fried potatoes and Roman artichokes standing on their head. Starters include hearty ribollita or faro soup and the long Tuscan pasta, pici, while in season the tantalizing aroma of tagliolini al tartufo bianco issues an almost irresistible invitation. Wines from all regions are listed and you can finish with a good homemade dessert. In summer there are tables outside. • Via Germanico 58/60, +39 06 397 25717, ristorantedaltoscano.it. Closed Mon.

The large ravioli with ricotta and lemon zest and the spaghetti with bottarga (cured fish roe) are Sardinian gems but Angelo also makes some of the best carbonara and matriciana in Rome. In the evening you can order thin, crispy pizza and there is a good choice of meat and fish dishes. Angelo's wife, Dorina, makes the delicious desserts and since her torta di ricotta sells out every evening do ask her to save a portion for you if you are eating later.

Francesco and Cristina are passionate, often driving to two fish auctions a day to get the finest catch. The fish here deserves the ultimate Italian accolade: \"It knows the sea\". The creative hot and cold antipasti are delicious but the pasta with granseola – spider crab – is delectable and the sword fish agnoletti with red pepper sauce must be ordered when on the menu. If you want to sample the excellent fish for main course, or the desserts, you will need to skip the antipasti or pasta. A good wine list completes the pleasure.

There is a large, magical garden and generations of children have allowed the adults to enjoy their meal as they gaze entranced at the turtles and goldfish around the fountain. If not scrigno, there is also the ziti al prosciutto, but to really enjoy this sinfully buttery dish you must throw dignity to the wind and tie your napkin round your neck.

These benefits show up, statistically speaking and seasoned with caveats, among people who eat pizza as pizza. The delightful statistico-medico-pizza effects do not happen so much, the researchers emphasise, for individuals who eat the pizza ingredients individually. Back in 2001, Dario Giugliano, Francesco Nappo and Ludovico Coppola, at Second University Naples, published a study in the journal Circulation called Pizza and Vegetables Don't Stick to the Endothelium. The thrust of their finding was that, unlike many other typical Italian meals, pizza does not necessarily cause clogged blood vessels (atherosclerosis) and death. Silvano Gallus of the Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche, in Milan, has cooked up several studies about the health effects of ingesting pizza. In 2003, together with colleagues from Naples, Rome and elsewhere, Gallus published a report called Does Pizza Protect Against Cancer?, in the International Journal of Cancer. It compares several thousand people who were treated for cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, larynx, colon, or rectum with patients who were treated for other, non-cancer ailments. Several hospitals gathered data about what the patients said they habitually ate. The study ends up speaking, in a vague, general way of an \"apparently favourable effect of pizza on cancer risk in Italy\". A year later, in a monograph in the European Journal of Cancer Prevention, Gallus and two colleagues wrote that: \"Regular consumption of pizza, one of the most typical Italian foods, showed a reduced risk of digestive tract cancers.\" Also in 2004, another team anchored by Gallus published a monograph called Pizza and Risk of Acute Myocardial Infarction, in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition. As you would expect from the title, its purpose was \"to evaluate the potential role of pizza consumption on the risk of acute myocardial infarction\". Gallus and his team \"suggest that pizza consumption is a favourable indicator\" for preventing, or at least not causing, heart attacks. Gallus is in no way claiming that pizza prevents all ills. A Gallus-led study called Pizza Consumption and the Risk of Breast, Ovarian and Prostate Cancer appeared in 2006 in the European Journal of Cancer Prevention. These types of cancer are thought to arise differently than the kinds believed to be warded off by pizza. The study puts its message bluntly: \"Our results do not show a relevant role of pizza on the risk of sex hormone-related cancers.\" The Gallus studies all hedge their bets a bit. Each says, in one way or another (and here I'm paraphrasing them): \"Pizza may in fact merely represent a general indicator of the so-called Mediterranean diet, which has been shown to have potential health benefits.\" All of this pertains to Italian-made pizza, metabolised in Italy. No matter how accurate the scientists' interpretations turn out to be, there's no guarantee that they hold true for foreign pizza, or for any pizza eaten anywhere by foreigners. • Marc Abrahams is editor of the bimonthly Annals of Improbable Research and organiser of the Ig Nobel prize","Id":"education/2010/aug/16/pizza-save-life-improbable-research","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webTitle":"The life-saving qualities of pizza","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/aug/16/pizza-save-life-improbable-research","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2010/aug/16/pizza-save-life-improbable-research","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":510,"webPublicationDate":"2010-08-16T15:30:03Z","id":"education/2010/aug/16/pizza-save-life-improbable-research","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Oscars 2014 live: the ceremony","body":"5.25am GMT The Oscars done and dusted It’s over, it’s over, it‘s finally over. What began on the sticky, bloody red carpet culminated - possibly five hours, conceivably five days - later with a last gasp victory for 12 Years a Slave, a sudden turnabout to dent the otherwise impregnable Gravity. Was it dramatic? Well, it was and it wasn’t. On the one hand the big awards went exactly the way that most people (myself included) had predicted. On the other, the march of Gravity became so thunderous, so all-encompassing that it became increasingly hard to believe that it would not crown its Oscar haul with the biggest prize of them all. For most of the night Steve McQueen’s searing historical drama was forced to sit on the sidelines, oppressed and ignored. And then in one fell bound it was free. It is a most deserving best picture winner, all the more so for appearing to triumph against against the grain of the event as a whole. That’s it from us. Thanks for sticking with us; maybe see you again next year. And now, in the words of Matthew McConaughey, “Amen. All right, all right, all right.” We’re off to get our O-shot. Updated at 6.28am GMT 5.04am GMT Leaping to victory “Everyone deserves not just to survive but to live,” director Steve McQueen tells the world. “This is the legacy of Solomon Northup.” He thanks his mother, who is sitting far away, at the back of the hall. She gets to her feet and waves at him wildly; a tiny figure in the distance, utterly heartbreaking and beautiful even at 500 paces. McQueen grabs the Oscar and then jumps up and down. He’s jumping like a jackrabbit. He has just taken flight.

But instead the best actor Oscar goes where everyone always said it would - right into the hands of Matthew McConaughey for his brilliantly robust and committed performance in Dallas Buyers Club. His grin is as wide as the Rio Grande. He thanks God. He thanks his dad who “liked gumbo” and who “taught him how to be a man and then for good measure he thanks his momma too. He finishes in a ramble by thanking himself - or at least the version of himself that is always ten years in the future and who he is forever trying to catch. “Amen”, he says. “Alright, alright, alright.” I think he might have just caught himself up.

Cuarón, it should be noted, has lived in London for the past 13 years. “For many of us making this film was a transformative experience,” the director says, gesturing at his greying hair. “For a lot of people that transformation was wisdom.

He adds an Oscar to the Golden Globe that he won a few weeks back and splutters disarmingly when he comes to read his speech at the mark. Once upon a time his films were written by the great Charlie Kaufman. He now seems to be doing pretty well on his own. Yet a win for Her comes at the expense of others. Specifically where on earth is American Hustle? David O Russell’s film came into the night as joint frontrunner with 10 nominations. It now risks being sent home entirely empty handed.

But he makes this admission with a grimace that suggests that it may be an awful confession, the thing he has wanted to get off his chest for years and years. So he’s probably addressing the voice in the sky. It’s kind of a Her scenario that he has going on. I’m so intrigued by Travolta’s confession that I sit slack-jawed through Let it Go, the song from Frozen, which is sung with brio by Idina Menzel.

Glenn Close cues up the graceful, tasteful montage and after that the ghosts come wafting through the auditoreum. What a lot of ghosts there are this year. It’s hello and goodbye to James Gandolfini, Jim Kelly, Saul Zaentz, Roger Ebert, Paul Walker, Karen Black, Peter O’Toole, Shirley Temple and the wonderful Philip Seymour Hoffman. “We love you, we honour you, we miss you,” says Close. ”But most of all we thank you.” The montage wraps up and the curtains part. Out comes Bette Midler. She’s singing Wind Beneath My Wings. Memo to the dearly departed. You are in a far, far better place - at least right at this moment. Every cloud has a silver lining.

Updated at 3.52am GMT 3.48am GMT WIN - THE GREAT GATSBY (SET DESIGN) Joining Martin on the stage is Beverly Dunn, who collects the prize for set design. But I’m confused. Are these statues different, or are they like conjoined twins? If the former, then The Great Gatsby is in second place (behind Gravity) with three awards. If the latter, it’s tied with Dallas Buyers Club on two. Updated at 3.53am GMT 3.46am GMT WIN - THE GREAT GATSBY (PRODUCTION DESIGN) Clearly there is some kind of two for one deal at this stage of the Oscars. In one fell swoop, Catherine Martin is called up to collect the award for her Great Gatsby set decoration. But she must share her moment with a colleague. 3.42am GMT Backstage at the Oscars The excitement, it appears, has officially reached code-red. Hadley Freeman mails in a flurry: Paolo Sorrentino could not sound more bored talking to the press backstage. There is a pleasing Toni Servillo-like languidity to him. Or it might just be that he is really uninterested in endless questions about what his win means to Italy Updated at 3.43am GMT 3.39am GMT 53rd song of the night Give it up for Pink. She’s here to sing a medley of songs to celebrate the 75th anniversary of The Wizard of Oz. The film, not the book. Or the wizard. ”If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow, why oh why can’t I?” sings Pink. But I think the question is merely rhetorical. The audience respond with a standing ovation. Not one of them attempts to answer her. Pink sings Somwhere Over the Rainbow at the 86th Academy Awards Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images Updated at 3.42am GMT 3.34am GMT WIN - GRAVITY (EDITING) That rumble you hear is a genuine Oscar landslide. Mark Sanger and Alfonso Cuaron head up to the stage to pick up the editing Oscar for Gravity, bringing the film’s total to five awards and counting. Sanger hogs the microphone and the music rears up just as Cuaron clears his throat. The director walks back to his seat without saying a word. Cuaron doesn’t look overly concerned about this, however. In fact he’s almost suspiciously sanguine. Perhaps he thinks he might be invited back up there before too long. And if that weren’t enough, Hadley Freeman has just mailed from the press room: Lupita was predictably delightful backstage talking to the journalists. When asked how she felt when Liza Minelli bear hugged her, she replied “I felt quite fabulous!” She also talked about what her father whispered to her when she won: “He said, ‘Thank you.’ I feel like Willy Wonka!” She even dealt with the crazy questions in style. When asked “What have you learnt about the human spirit on your amazing journey?”, she tactfully deflected: “That’s a tough one! I guess I’ve learnt I don’t have to be anyone but myself.” A Mexican journalist, “How much of your triumph belongs to Mexico?” (Nyong’o was born in Mexico.) Nyong’o replied with a laugh, “I think it all belongs to me!”﻿ Updated at 6.54am GMT 3.30am GMT WIN - GRAVITY (CINEMATOGRAPHY) Amy Adams and Bill Murray totter out from behind the curtain to read the nominees for this year’s cinematography Oscar. “Oh, we forgot one,” says Murray right at the end. “Harold Ramis, for Caddyshack, Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day.” It’s a warm, rueful (and very Murray-ish) shout out to his old friend and partner, who died last week. After all that the actual award risks feeling like an afterthought. It goes (as everyone predicted it would) to Emmanuel Lubezki for Gravity.

Every winner is like, “Um, why do you care? Are you planning to steal it?” 3.00am GMT Third song of the night Exit Tyler Perry, enter Brad Pitt. He’s here to introduce U2 and U2 are here to play Ordinary Love, their song from the Mandela biopic. Bono appears to have gone up about three octaves since the last time I heard him. Maybe it has something to do with the shorts that everyone seems to be name-checking at this year’s Oscars. How many more Oscar songs do we have to sit through tonight? I’m still hoping they’ll play Alone Yet Not Alone, the theme from the Christian faith movie that was banned at the eleventh hour. Fingers crossed they can get Jack Nicholson to sing it.

He’s listing his inspirations and one feels he could go on and on. “Ladies and gentlemen,” interrupts the voice in the sky. “Please welcome Tyler Perry.” What a glorious juxtaposition.

They come up together and proceed to give their thanks in unison. They exit stage left with the Oscar for best animated feature film.

But it’s hard cheese for his fellow film-maker, who can’t get a word in edgeways. He stands blinking silently in the limelight as Witz hogs all the glory.

Heading into the night, I figured that American Hustle was a dead cert to scoop the hair and make-up award, if only because the film is first and foremost the story of what happens to Christian Bale’s hairpiece. The indignities that befall. The horrors that are meted upon it. But no. Shockingly, the Oscar goes Adruitha Lee and Robin Mathews for their work on Dallas Buyers Club. In fairness, they look as stunned as anyone. Quick check of the nominees. It turns out that American Hustle wasn’t even shortlisted for the hair and make-up. My apologies. But what a slap in the face for the Bale wig. What’s wrong with those voters? That’s the big scandal of this year’s Oscars right there. Samuel L.

But the upside for the losing nominees (for Abdi, Hill and the rest) is that they all take home an official Oscar goodie bag worth a reported $80,000. This bag contains all manner of riches. There are luxury holiday vouchers and a home spa system. There is “horse shampoo” and a pepper-spray gun. Most intriguingly of all, the bag contains a “vaginal rejuvenation” treatment known as the O-shot. Something to bear in mind, what with Mother’s Day coming up. The Oscar goodie bag may sound outlandish to you and me, but it offers a fascinating snapshot of modern-day celebrity. Its contents provide a kind of composite portrait of the Hollywood thoroughbred. When the likes of Sandra Bullock and Julia Roberts are not off gallivanting on a luxury vacation, they can be found tottering around Beverly Hills, reeking of the stables and pursued by horse rustlers. They brandish pepper-spray guns as they dart, loins aflame, from their limo to the lunch. 1.47am GMT WIN - BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR: JARED LETO (DALLAS BUYERS CLUB) His red bow-tie blazing, his leonine locks flowing, Jared Leto steps up to collect the Oscar for his acclaimed turn opposite Matthew McConaughey in the rangy, satisfying Dallas Buyers Club. His speech heaps praise on his mother. “I love you mom,” he tells her. “Thanks for helping me to dream.” He goes on to dedicate his award to “all the other dreamers” in Venezuela and the Ukraine. “We are here,” he informs them. I think he means this as a word of encouragement and it is clearly well-meant, though I’m not sure how much actual comfort it provides. Sleep easy, Ukraine. The celebrities are all inside the Dolby theatre.

Here come the contenders. • Barkhad Adbi, the desperate Somali pirate in Captain Phillips. • Bradley Cooper, the player that was played in American Hustle. • Michael Fassbender, the sulphurous plantation owner out of 12 Years a Slave. • Jonah Hill, who played broker house Egor to The Wolf of Wall Street. • Jared Leto, tottering on heels in Dallas Buyers Club.

Minnelli responds with a pained, frozen grimace. Dallas Buyers Club, she adds, is a film about “people who have sex at rodeos”. Jonah Hill is praised for his full frontal appearance in The Wolf of Wall Street. “Jonah, you showed me something in that film that I haven’t seen in a long time,” DeGeneres tells him. The night, she concludes, can go one of two ways. Either 12 Years a Slave wins everything or the voters are racist. And with that we’re pitched, without further ado, into the first prize of the night.

Maybe they have all collectively gone insane. Undeterred, the celebrities keep filing past the screaming hordes on the sodden bleachers. Jonah Hill thinks they are screaming for Leonardo DiCaprio. Lupita Nyong’o explains that her Prada dress was “inspired by champagne bubbles”. The crowd, in the meantime, continues to scream. 1.16am GMT Whither the Oscars? The carpet has taken over. The carpet is king. Aren’t the Academy Awards meant to start a few minutes from now? Shouldn’t everyone be making there way to their seats by now? Apparently not. The guests are still arriving, the hosts are in full spate. Everybody, it seems, is still stuck outside the Dolby theatre, squishing back and forth across a rug that has turned as red and viscid as beetroot soup? “Woo hoo!” scream the hosts. “It’s Jamie Foxx!” They are in their element, they can keep this up all night. Maybe they don’t even realise that there are awards to announce. Maybe they think that there’s just these cameras, this carpet, and that the door to the Dolby leads to nowhere, or possibly to death. Apologies for the morbidity. Stare too long at a blood-red carpet and the whole experience starts to feel a tad existential. “Woo hoo, the carpet looks like freshly spilled guts! Woo hoo, Jamie Foxx has just trodden in entrails!” For the love of God, please send the guests inside.

So relax; it’s OK. Jennifer Lawrence has not rocked up to the Oscars like some demented backwoods Buffalo Bill, with the rotting skin and pelt of Christian Dior plastered to her naked limbs. Possibly with her teeth filed down to points, just to complete the image. That would be repellent. But we digress. She is wearing a dress. The Dior pelt starts to turn ...

Here are some facts about your host for the night. Ryan Seacrest used to recite the pledge of allegiance over his high school PA system, sparking a lifelong love of broadcasting. Ryan Seacrest is five-foot-nine-inches tall. Ryan Seacrest was born with a tail that he had surgically removed ahead of his high school prom. One of the above facts is entirely made up. How to best explain the cultural phenomenon that is Ryan Seacrest.

So the press now all has wet bottoms and are very grumpy. But no matter! The MC is warming up the red carpet (”Who here loves The Ellen Show?!??!!!”) and the sun is finally coming out. We are set to start. After the Oscars are done and dusted, we are hoping that Hadley will be heading off to yet another of Harvey Weinstein’s famous parties. She went to the last one, just after the Baftas, and had such a whale of a time that Mr Weinstein promptly joined her on the dance floor (aka wrote a furious clarification). Updated at 10.39pm GMT 10.25pm GMT General housekeeping At the risk of letting light in on magic, it should be noted that we are actually blogging these Oscars from the heart of the Guardian newsroom in wintry central London. But our esteemed colleague Hadley Freeman is on the ground in Los Angeles and shall be reporting in throughout the night.

Updated at 10.46pm GMT 10.13pm GMT The night to come Buckle up, because we’re in this for the long haul. The next few hours sees the awards race reach its climax. 12 Years a Slave wades into battle against American Hustle, while Gravity attempts to pull weight in the best picture category. The latest odds suggest that it’s looking good for Matthew McConaughey and Cate Blanchett, Jennifer Lawrence and Jared Leto, The Act of Killing and The Great Beauty. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. The night is still young and there’s a red carpet to walk. The annual celebrity parade kicks off shortly, gleefully hosted (as it is every year) by the Amazing Smirking Imps of E!. For the rest us, there is still ample time to kick back, pour out a stiff drink and preview the Oscars at leisure. Here’s what we’ve cooked up by way of an appetiser ...

The stormclouds are massing, Russian forces are in Crimea and the world stands on the brink of another cold war. Now the good news. It’s the 86th Academy Awards, live as a petri-dish from the Dolby theatre in LA. The red carpet has been vacuumed and the stars freshly laundered. We’re all set for a billion dollar spread of bread and circuses to distract us from the burgeoning horrors way out to the east. And thank heavens for that. So kick back, relax. Everything’s going to be fine. The Oscars have surely never felt more relevant and necessary than they do tonight.

But co-owner Pasquale Alessi still vividly recalls serving the popular, engaging student from Coulsdon, south London, who joined friends at a Halloween night party at the bar on 31 October 2007, a few weeks after enrolling at the University for Foreigners in the town. It was a big night out, commemorated by the photographs posted online of Kercher, 21, in a vampire mask. It was also her last night out. The following evening she opted to watch a video and eat pizza with her English friends at a flat in town, as the Italian students who usually fill the piazzas of Perugia headed home for a long holiday weekend. At 9pm Kercher's friend Sophie Purton was walking her home through the dark streets to the cottage Kercher was renting with two Italian women – who were away that night – and Amanda Knox, 21, a student from Seattle. Isolated and clinging to a slope that falls away from the road circling the hill town, the cottage commands spectacular views over the Perugian hills, but is easy to miss from the road above. What happened next has been the subject of four trials and a supreme court hearing, thousands of pages of reports and rulings by police, magistrates and judges, and a media frenzy that culminated in last night's drama in the Perugia court. The investigation began the next morning when a local woman heard a phone ringing at the end of her garden. She called the police, who traced the phone to one of Kercher's Italian flatmates. Arriving at the cottage, officers found Knox and Italian IT student Raffaele Sollecito, then 24, whom Knox had been dating since meeting him a week earlier at a classical music concert. Knox said she had returned from a night at Sollecito's flat to find the cottage door unlocked, a window broken, blood in the bathroom and Kercher's bedroom door locked. After the door was kicked down, police found Kercher – a physically strong woman who had taken karate lessons – dead on the floor under a duvet, partially undressed with three deep knife wounds to her neck. Police grew suspicious of the broken window in the bedroom of one of the Italians. A rock was found on the floor but investigators doubted it could have been thrown from outside during a break-in, and later learned the shutters had been left closed. The break-in had probably been staged, they concluded, by someone who knew Kercher, and the mobile phones they found had most likely been discarded as the murderers fled. Forensic investigators from Rome were soon on the scene, taking over from local police and barring the town coroner from checking the body until around midnight, preventing an accurate time of death being determined. Knox, meanwhile, behaved oddly, the police believed, turning up in a lingerie shop the following day, where she looked at G-strings and was overheard promising Sollecito \"wild sex\". Kercher's English friends, who later testified to a frosty relationship between Kercher and the ostentatious Knox, said that as she awaited questioning at Perugia police station, Knox had appeared untouched by Kercher's death. What Knox told officers in the early hours of 6 November convinced investigators they had their murderer. Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini questioned Knox about a text she sent on the night of 1 November to Patrick Lumumba, the manager of the bar where Knox worked, saying: \"See you later.\" Knox is said to have confessed she was at the cottage on the night of the murder and saw Lumumba enter Kercher's room. \"In my mind I saw Patrick in confused images,\" she allegedly said, adding: \"I was in the kitchen with my hands over my ears because in my head I heard Meredith scream.\" Sollecito, Knox and Lumumba were promptly arrested, but the last was freed when a customer at his bar gave him an alibi. Knox withdrew her statement, claiming she made it as officers yelled and cuffed her round the head. By then a bloody handprint in Kercher's room had led police to Rudy Guede, an Ivory Coast-born drifter who was doing odd jobs after being adopted by a well-to-do local family. Tracked down in Germany, he was flown back to Italy in handcuffs after being arrested by coincidence by local police for travelling on a train with no ticket. He was sentenced to 16 years for his role in the murder. Prosecutors sought to establish a link between Guede, Knox and Sollecito, alleging the three killed Kercher during a sexual assault. A knife found in Sollecito's kitchen that allegedly bore Kercher's and Knox's DNA was cited as the murder weapon, while Sollecito's DNA was allegedly found on Kercher's bra clasp. The DNA findings were challenged by court-appointed experts during Knox and Sollecito's appeal. Knox and Sollecito have claimed that on the night of the murder they were at Sollecito's flat watching a video, cooking a meal and having sex.","Id":"world/2011/oct/03/meredith-kercher-murder-burglary-perugia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Meredith Kercher murder: break-in and handprint clues at isolated cottage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/03/meredith-kercher-murder-burglary-perugia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/oct/03/meredith-kercher-murder-burglary-perugia","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":850,"webPublicationDate":"2011-10-03T21:50:01Z","id":"world/2011/oct/03/meredith-kercher-murder-burglary-perugia","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Eat like a local in Rome","body":"It's easy to eat mediocre, overpriced food in Rome, a city where tourists – and the restaurants geared towards them – are thick on the ground. Which is a shame because with its wealth of family-run establishments, and access to fresh ingredients grown just outside the city, Rome boasts a number of top-value places to drink and dine. The trick is knowing where the locals go. Below, we list 10 ways to eat well in the Eternal City without breaking the bank. 1. Morning coffee Whether you want a simple caffé normale (espresso) or a refreshing granita (a semi-frozen coffee-and-sugar concoction), you can't find better than at Caffè Sant'Eustachio. Located on a hidden piazza round the corner from the Pantheon, the cafe, which has been in business for 72 years, is crammed with locals, and the occasional savvy tourist, both morning and mid-afternoon. Run by brothers Raimondo and Roberto Ricci since 1999, the coffee beans they use are organic, fair-trade, and hand-picked by Roberto on his tasting trips to South and Central America. Just remember to pay and get your ticket before you head to the counter. • Piazza Sant'Eustachio 82. +39 06 68802048, santeustachioilcaffe.it. Open daily. 2. Lunch Taverna dei Fori Imperiali, Rome Photograph: Amanda Ruggeri for the Guardian Photograph: Amanda Ruggeri/Guardian The standard menu at neighbourhood favourite La Taverna dei Fori Imperiali offers reasonably-priced, classic dishes such as gnocchi and saltimbocca alla romana, though regulars know to always ask about the day's specials for delicacies like home-made pasta with white-truffle ragu. The food at this family-run affair in the Monti area near the Colosseum has been described by former New York Times food critic Frank Bruni as \"sensational\", and it's all cooked by chef and owner Alessio Liberatore, whose children Aldo and Claudia serve diners nightly at the red-and-white checked tables. You'll need reservations for dinner, so come at lunchtime, after seeing the Forum and Colosseum. • Via della Madonna dei Monti 9. +39 06 6798643, latavernadeiforiimperiali.com. Closed Tuesdays. 3. Gelateria Ciampini gelateria, Rome Photograph: Amanda Ruggeri Photograph: Amanda Ruggeri Lots of gelaterias claim to be \"the best\" in Rome, and the debate can keep Romans arguing for hours. One that never fails is Ciampini, located halfway between Piazza Navona and the Spanish Steps. It's where well-heeled locals go to sip drinks on the piazza and, of course, order gelato, with flavours ranging from the classic (rich dark chocolate) to exotic (chestnut, and peach-and-pinenut). At €2.50 for a small cup, it's not Rome's cheapest gelato, but it's a small price to pay for a taste of heaven. • Piazza San Lorenzo in Lucina 29. +39 06 6876606. Open daily. 4. Cakes and tiramisu Cakes at Pompi cafe, Rome Photograph: Amanda Ruggeri Photograph: Amanda Ruggeri To get the veins buzzing, head to Pompi at Piazza dei Re di Roma, one metro stop from San Giovanni. Pompi is a cafe, gelateria, and pastry shop – but Romans flock here for its tiramisu. Enjoy the creamy, espresso-laden dessert, which means \"pick-me-up\" in Italian, in any of Pompi's three flavours: banana, strawberry or classic. Pompi also boasts Italian pastries such as bigné, cassata siciliana, pannacotta, and cannoli. And, rare for Rome, it's open until 1:30am, making it a great spot for a late-night snack. • Via Albalonga 7B/9/11. +39 06 7000418, barpompi.it. Closed Mondays. 5. Aperitivo Freni e Frizione bar, Rome Photograph: Amanda Ruggeri Photograph: Amanda Ruggeri Rome imported aperitivo – the 8pm spread of food that whets the appetite – from northern Italy. Even Romans, therefore, tend to admit that their city hasn't really figured it out yet. But they agree on one exception: Freni e Frizione. Housed in a former garage in Rome's trendy Trastevere neighbourhood (hence the name: \"Brakes and Clutches\"), it's always crammed with the city's young and hip, taking advantage of its buffet offerings such as hummus and couscous, not to mention its top-notch mojitos. • Via del Politeama 4/6. freniefrizioni.com, +39 06 45497499. Aperitivo from 7pm-10:30pm, drinks from 6:30pm-2am. Open daily. 6. Cucina romana Located in the gritty, graffiti-daubed neighbourhood of San Lorenzo, Il Pommidoro has been run by the same family since opening in 1926. It dishes up real Roman food for real Roman prices, such as pasta carbonara for €8. With such hearty local dishes as pappardelle with wild-boar ragu, grilled sweetbreads, or pajata (the cooked intestines of milk-fed calves), it's not one for vegetarians – or the squeamish. (It does, however, offer a lengthy list of fish dishes). Instead, Il Pommidoro is the place to try authentic cucina romana without emptying your wallet – or hearing a word of English spoken. • Piazza dei Sanniti 44. +39 06 4452692. Closed Sundays. 7. Pasta Roma Sparita restaurant, Rome Photograph: Amanda Ruggeri Photograph: Amanda Ruggeri Trastevere's Roma Sparita serves excellent fritti, pizza, and meat and fish, but it's most famous for its traditional Roman dish of cacio e pepe (pasta with pecorino romano sheep cheese and black pepper). And with reason. Don't let the simplicity of this dish fool you. Done Roma Sparita-style and served in a fried parmesan basket as the final flourish, you'll be dreaming about it long after you've left the city. This restaurant, overlooking one of Trastevere's pretty piazzas, is always packed with Romans – tourists have yet to discover it. That makes its name particularly apt: \"Roma Sparita,\" which used to be a nickname for all of Trastevere, literally meaning \"disappeared,\" or undiscovered, Rome. • Piazza Santa Cecilia 24. +39 06 5800757, romasparita.com. Closed Sundays for dinner and Mondays all day. 8. Regional cuisine Palatium restaurant, Rome Photograph: Amanda Ruggeri Photograph: Amanda Ruggeri When locals want a taste of Lazio beyond Rome's borders, they flock to the Spanish Steps' Palatium. The restaurant is a chic change from Rome's traditional, checkered-tablecloth trattorias. It's also slightly pricier (pastas are around €10, mains €15), but justifiably so: run by the Lazio Regional Authority, Palatium showcases more than 1,000 Lazio products in delicious, traditional dishes with a twist, such as ricotta-and-mint ravioli. Book in advance. • Via Frattina 94. +39 06 69202132, enotecapalatium.it. Closed Sundays. 9. Pizzeria Formula Uno pizzaria, Rome Photograph: Amanda Ruggeri Photograph: Amanda Ruggeri Sure, you can get good pizza in the city centre at guidebook favourites Da Baffetto or La Montecarlo. But to eat top-notch pizza without other tourists crowding your table, head to San Lorenzo's Formula Uno, where the crust is thin and crispy and the prices are dirt cheap (where else can you get an ingredient-laden pizza capriciossa for €6?). A bonus: unlike most pizzerias, Formula Uno – whose name and decor pay homage to the Italians' love affair with car racing – is open for lunch, too. • Via degli Equi 13. +39 06 4453866. Closed Sundays. 10. Wine bar Il Goccetto, Rome Photograph: Amanda Ruggeri for the Guardian Photograph: Amanda Ruggeri/Guardian To taste wines from across Italy (and France) in a beautiful, local setting, you can't beat Il Goccetto. Tucked just around the corner from Campo dei Fiori, Il Goccetto has a lengthy wine list (owner Anna Sbarro says she has more than 300 bottles in her collection), a lovely setting (a 17th-century palazzo designed by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger), and a local clientele. The atmosphere is relaxed and intimate, and it's not uncommon to see patrons or even the workers themselves reading a newspaper or playing chess on one of the wooden tables. Look up, too: the ceiling was painted in 1700. • Via dei Banchi Vecchi 14. + 39 06 6864268.

Julian Smith, the MP for Skipton and Ripon, raised concerns about the Guardian's coverage of the US National Security Agency files, leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, in a House of Commons debate on Tuesday. He wrongly claimed it had distributed information about British intelligence agents and called for the Guardian to be prosecuted. \"To communicate, not just publish, any identifying information about GCHQ personnel is a terrorist offence,\" he told MPs. However, on his website, he has publicly identified staff from the high-security US base, publishing a picture of himself posing with more than 30 people outside the House of Commons. The caption reads: \"Julian has welcomed a group of around 40 people from RAF Menwith Hill to Westminster\". The picture also appears on Smith's Facebook page where it states: \"Enjoyed meeting members of the British-American group from RAF Menwith Hill\". The Guardian has republished the picture, pixelating the faces of everyone except the MP to ensure there is no threat to national security.

I'll be back with more on Monday. 5.11pm BST Summary Here’s a summary of today’s key events: • David Cameron has attacked Edward Snowden and those publishing his leaks and defended the British security services as “some of the most talented and bright and hard-working and dedicated officials in our country”. He criticised those who had “some la di da, airy fairy view about what this all means”, preferring instead the “cold” view that “there are lots of people in the world who want to do us harm”. Snowden, and “to an extent” newspapers that had published stories based on his leaks, were “going to make our world more dangerous”, the British prime minister said. Cameron also said he was “satisfied” with the framework of oversight for the security services. • A delegation of MEPs will travel to Washington on Monday to seek a response to allegations of widespread spying by the United States against EU citizens and governments. In addition Germany spy chiefs will travel to Washington “shortly” to discuss the same issues. The French and German governments have demanded talks with the US by the end of the year as the row over the spying activities of the US National Security Agency intensified following the revelation that Angela Merkel’s phone was monitored. The EU issued a joint statement raising “deep concerns” over the surveillance scandals. • Lisa Monaco, Barack Obama’s assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism, has written a column for USA Today claiming that the NSA does not operate “unrestrained” – although, she says, the US’s capabilities are “unmatched”. 4.52pm BST The US government \"fatally undermined\" Lavabit, the secure email service used by whistleblower Edward Snowden, when it demanded access to encryption keys that kept the service secure, the American Civil Liberties Union said in court filings on Friday, reports Dominic Rushe in New York. The ACLU has filed a \"friend of the court\" briefing in defence of Lavabit and its founder, Ladar Levison, who faces contempt of court charges after his decision to close down his service rather than co-operate with US authorities. ACLU lawyer Catherine Crump said the government's \"unreasonably burdensome\" demands \"fundamentally destroyed the company as a whole\". 4.24pm BST On the Fox News website, Judge Andrew P Napolitano writes that \"every American who values the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, every American who enjoys the right to be different and the right to be left alone, and every American who believes that the government works for us and we don’t work for the government should thank Edward Snowden for his courageous and heroic revelations of the National Security Agency’s gargantuan spying operations.\" He adds: Without Snowden’s revelations, we would be ignorant children to a paternalistic government and completely in the dark about what the government sees of us and knows about us. And we would not know that it has stolen our freedoms. 4.22pm BST In the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Jay Bookman argues that \"it should never have taken a whistleblower willing to risk life imprisonment or perpetual exile to let the American people know of the existence of these programs. They were kept top secret not because the information would have been valuable to potential terrorists -- terrorists already expect to be tracked and spied upon -- but because intelligence officials wanted to avoid public debate and possible brakes on their power.\" 4.06pm BST Caitlin Hayden, a White House National Security Council spokeswoman, confirmed the forthcoming visit of German spy chiefs: German officials plan to travel to Washington in coming weeks and the U.S. government looks forward to meeting with them. We expect a range of meetings with relevant officials across the US interagency, but we do not have specific meetings to announce at this point. 3.42pm BST It is highly likely that any information gleaned from the NSA's snooping on Angela Merkel would have been shared with GCHQ, writes Nick Hopkins. It's even possible the eavesdropping was conducted through Menwith Hill, the RAF base in North Yorkshire that is a British base only in name. Menwith Hill is the NSA's surveillance hub in Europe. Snowden's documents have already shown that it intercepted the top-secret communications of the then Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, during his visit to Britain for the G20 summit in 2009. The papers also show this information was then shared with high-ranking officials from Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, the other members of the \"five eyes\" spying club. At the same summit, British spies were also snooping on other delegations, specifically from Turkey and South Africa. When the Intelligence Services Act was passed in 1994, it included a line – inserted at the last minute – that Britain's spy agencies could legitimately seek intelligence that would support the \"economic wellbeing\" of the country\". This provision is one of the most opaque in the law and could be interpreted to justify espionage on just about any head of state or company chief executive, though this would require ministerial signoff. Would Downing Street want to know Merkel's innermost thoughts? Of course it would. Knowing the mind of the world's most powerful woman would be invaluable during summits and bilateral talks, particularly at a time when Britain's membership of the EU is a source of constant tension. So Cameron probably signed the memorandum with fingers crossed behind his back knowing, perhaps, that Britain may have benefited from the NSA's surveillance on Merkel, and the 35 other world leaders it targeted. 2.35pm BST In a comment piece, Florida Democrat Alan Grayson says: \"Despite being a member of Congress possessing security clearance, I've learned far more about government spying on me and my fellow citizens from reading media reports than I have from \"intelligence\" briefings.\" I've requested classified information, and further meetings with NSA officials. The House Intelligence Committee has refused to provide either. Supporters of the NSA's vast ubiquitous domestic spying operation assure the public that members of Congress can be briefed on these activities whenever they want. Senator Saxby Chambliss says all a member of Congress needs to do is ask for information, and he'll get it. Well I did ask, and the House Intelligence Committee said \"no\", repeatedly. And virtually every other member not on the Intelligence Committee gets the same treatment ... Edward Snowden's revelations demonstrate that the members of Congress, who are asked to authorize these programs, are not privy to the same information provided to junior analysts at the NSA, and even private contractors who sell services to foreign governments. The only time that these intelligence committees disclose classified information to us, your elected representatives, is when it serves the purposes of the \"intelligence community\". He asks: \"why do Generals [Keith] Alexander [NSA director] and [James] Clapper [director of national intelligence] remain in office, when all the evidence points to them committing the felony of lying to Congress and the American people?\" Updated at 3.54pm BST 2.24pm BST Rowena Mason writes: David Cameron is still using his mobile phone following revelations about US spying on foreign leaders, Downing Street has signalled. Asked whether the British prime minister was comfortable with using his phone after news that the NSA had allegedly monitored calls made by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, his spokesman appeared to confirm Cameron was still using the same mobile \"Yes, I haven't seen him use a different one,\" he said. 2.06pm BST Is he aware of any other EU country which is eavesdropping on British ministers? Without setting it to music, you know, I’m not going to comment on intelligence and security matters. I’ve set out the framework in which the British intelligence services operate. I’m satisfied, as prime minister and the minister effectively for the intelligence services, I’m satisfied that’s a good framework. It’s a framework that works, and above all, you know, at a time when everyone is discussing this issue, let’s remember that the people who do this work, that keeps us safe, that helps to keep us safe, they are people we can never properly thank, we can never properly identify. We can’t have medal parades and ceremonies for the very brave things that they do and so it is worth saying every now and again on a public platform these are some of the most talented and bright and hard-working and dedicated officials in our country. They love our country. They work for our country, and we should thank them rather than try to make their job more difficult. That was the final question. 1.56pm BST Did he know GCHQ’s Tempora programme was operating in Italy and did he discuss that with Italian PM Enrico Letta? There’s lots of discussions about these issues in the EU council as you could imagine. Let me say this, though, about what Mr Snowden has effectively done, and what some newspapers are assisting in doing, and that is going to make it a lot more difficult to keep our countries and our people safe. You know, we do have to take a sort of cold, hard look at this. As we stand today there are lots of people in the world who want to do us harm, who want to blow up our families, who want to maim people in our countries. That is the facts. It’s not a pleasant fact but it is true. We see it with what happened recently in Kenya, we see it with what happened to, you know, whether it was Italians or British people in In Amenas in Algeria, we’ve seen appalling attacks on British soil, we’ve seen appalling attacks throughout Europe. That is the threat that we face. And so we have a choice: do we maintain properly funded, properly governed intelligence and security services that can gather intelligence on these people using all the modern techniques to make sure that we can try to get ahead of them and stop them? Or do we stop doing that? And the point is what Snowden is doing, and to an extent what the newspapers are doing in helping him doing what he’s doing, is frankly signalling to people who mean to do us harm how to evade and avoid intelligence and surveillance and other techniques. That is not going to make our world safer. It is going to make our world more dangerous. And the first priority of a prime minister is to help try and keep your country safe, and that means not having some la di da, airy fairy view about what this all means, it’s understanding intelligence and security services do an important job. Yes, they need to be governed under law. Yes, they must be scrutinised by parliament, but we need those people; they’re brave people who help to keep us safe. And I’ve lost count of the plots that I’ve seen and the problems that I’ve seen being avoided by the work that they do. And that is really important, not just for Britain, but the information we gather, that we then share with other countries in Europe, has helped those countries in Europe too. So I make no apology for the fact that we have intelligence services, we will maintain intelligence services, and I will back the work they do, and I will criticise, though, those that, you know, make public some of the techniques they use because that is helping our enemies. Simple. 1.45pm BST Can Cameron reassure Merkel that neither he nor any other member of his government has seen any intelligence gleaned from tapping her phone? I’m not making further comments on intelligence and security matters, but they’re properly governed in the UK. 1.43pm BST The French and Germans say their negotiation over spying with the Americans is open to anyone who wants to take part. Will the UK join in? Could Five Eyes be expanded to include other countries? I welcome the statement that was made last night. I thought it was a sensible statement. I was very struck by my colleagues, how they don’t want some breach between the EU and the US, they want a good partnership, good trust and good relations. I think that what Angela and Francois want to do is entirely sensible, and other European countries are free to join in with that. Obviously Britain has a very strong unique intelligence partnership in many ways with the United States; that’s been very long-standing. Part of that is the Five Eyes partnership, which was established many, many years ago, involving New Zealand, Canada, Australia, as well, so for us I think we are in the right situation. But I understand what others want to do and very much support that, as I think will President Obama. I think he will welcome this approach. Indeed he really spoke about it as well as they were speaking about it at the same time. 1.38pm BST David Cameron speaking in Brussels today. Photograph: Sky News Photograph: Sky News 1.36pm BST Has he had any reason to believe that his mobile phone has been monitored? Has he ever asked the Americans if they have ever monitored his phone? While repeating my mantra that I don’t comment on intelligence issues, I think I can point you towards a statement made by the White House about this issue, which might give you some reassurance. 1.34pm BST Here are some direct quotes from David Cameron’s press conference. Was he able to reassure EU partners that GCHQ was not part of the worst cases of bugging revealed recently? Well first of all let me just repeat something that British governments have always held to, and I hold to myself, which is not to comment on intelligence matters. I think that is important. We all have secret intelligence services, as other countries do, but we don’t give a running commentary on what they do, we don’t comment on their work. That is very important. But let me make two points about the sort of framework for this. The first is I think the leaders of the European Union issued a good and sensible statement last night, about this matter, and I agree with that statement. And the second thing is specifically for Britain, but this applies to other countries as well, because remember this is a national responsibility, these intelligence agencies are a national responsibility, there’s no EU competence here, there's no EU drift here, and at the national level every national leader needs to be confident that their security services are properly overseen. Now in the United Kingdom we have proper parliamentary scrutiny through the intelligence and security committee, the ISC in parliament; we’ve strengthened that oversight. Everything that’s done is done within a framework of proper law. And wee also have intelligence commissioners to oversee the work of these agencies. So I’m satisfied that our intelligence agencies are properly governed, properly run, act under the law, and are subject to parliamentary scrutiny. And that is very important. But let me also say this: the work they do is very important. As prime minister I get to see that work at first hand. Every year for the last few years they have helped to obstruct, avoid and put off major terrorist attacks on our country. They help to keep our people safe. They actually help to keep people safe in other European countries too because we share so much intelligence and information with our EU partners. So they work they do is vital, they will always have my support, and they are properly scrutinised and run under the rule of law. 1.23pm BST Cameron says anonymous spies never get the thanks and “medal parades” they deserve and he wants to thank them now. 1.16pm BST Cameron is asked about whether GCHQ’s Tempora programme was operating in Italy. Cameron says Edward Snowden and the newspapers publishing his revelations are making it more difficult to keep our countries safe. People want to blow up our families, he says. We’ve seen appalling attacks throughout Europe. So do we maintain properly funded and governed intelligence services using “all of the modern techniques” or do we stop doing that? Snowden and “to an extent” the newspapers are signalling to people who mean to do us harm how to evade and avoid surveillance techniques. That’s going to make our country more dangerous. That means not having “some la di da, airy fairy view about what this all means”. Spies are brave people who help keep us safe and he has lost count of the number of plots that he has seen planned, Cameron says. And that helps other EU countries. He criticises those who make public some of the techniques of the spies, because “that is helping our enemies - simple”. 1.13pm BST Can he reassure Merkel that he and others have never seen information from her phone? He says he will not make further comments on intelligence and security matters and they are properly governed in the UK. 1.12pm BST The Guardian’s Ian Traynor asks him about the French and German desire to negotiate with the US over spying by Christmas. Will the UK take part? And could Five Eyes be expanded. Cameron repeats that he welcomed the EU statement. His colleagues don’t want some breach between the EU and the US, he says. They want trust and good relations. Obviously Britain has a strong and unique intelligence partnership with the US, he says. part of that is Five Eyes. “For us we are in the right situation but I understand what others want to do and very much support that. As will President Obama,” he says. 1.09pm BST (Yesterday the White House denied monitoring David Cameron's communications, according to the Daily Telegraph.) Caitlin Hayden, a spokesman for the National Security Council said: \"We do not monitor PM Cameron's communications.\" Asked if the US had ever spied on Mr Cameron in the past, she replied: \"No\". 1.08pm BST Has he ever asked the US if his phone has been monitored? He points towards a White House statement which he says will reassure the reporter about that. 1.07pm BST He says there is parliamentary oversight of the UK’s security services and he is satisfied with that. The work they do is very important, he says. They have helped to obstruct terrorist attacks every year. And they help other EU countries too because the UK shares information with others. 1.06pm BST Cameron takes questions. He is asked if he could reassure the EU leaders that GCHQ was not part of the worst cases of bugging. He says he will not comment on intelligence matters. “We all have secret intelligence services, as other countries do.” But he says the EU leaders issued a “good and sensible” statement last night which he agrees with. Intelligence agencies are a national, not EU, responsibility, he says. 1.03pm BST The PM says attempts to take the US-EU trade deal \"off track\" have been “seen off” and he is very pleased about that. 1.02pm BST He is discussing his own priority of deregulation in Europe. 1.01pm BST David Cameron is speaking now in Brussels. 1.00pm BST Angela Merkel has revealed further details about her use of her mobile phone, reports Philip Oltermann in Berlin. At the EU summit on Thursday, the German chancellor clarified that she makes a point of conducting conversations about party political issues and matters of state through a variety channels. \"For all communication relevant to matters of state there are landlines, encrypted lines and if you are away from the landline, there are encrypted mobiles,\" she emphasised, later adding that \"those [mobiles] which are less encrypted are more likely to be bugged than those that are encrypted\". Angela Merkel.

French President François Hollande also called for a new \"code of conduct\" agreed between national intelligence services in the EU, begging the question of whether Britain would opt to join in ... Given the role of GCHQ in the mass surveillance, Cameron found himself the target of veiled criticism at the summit, according to witnesses. Merkel complained that Britain enjoyed a privileged position with the Americans because it is the only EU member in the \"Five Eyes Club\" – the intelligence-sharing arrangement linking the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Senior EU security officials suspect that Berlin may seek to exploit the crisis to gain admission to, or at least greater co-operation with the Five Eyes pact. Cameron, sources said, responded to the critical remarks by stressing that under his premiership the shared intelligence with the four other countries had resulted in several terrorist plots being foiled, with countless lives saved.

The three-day visit by nine members of the European parliament's civil liberties committee will include meetings with senior US government and intelligence officials and explore \"possible legal remedies for EU citizens\" resulting from the alleged surveillance, although it is not clear what such remedies might entail, Reuters reports. The parliament is also holding an inquiry into the impact on Europe from leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden \"A key priority for this inquiry is to gather all relevant information and evidence from US sources, which is why this fact-finding delegation to Washington is so important,\" Claude Moraes, a Labour MEP who is leading the parliamentary inquiry, said in a statement. 12.46pm BST The German government has said that senior officials will travel to the US \"shortly\" for talks at the White House and with the National Security Agency to push forward efforts to clear up the surveillance allegations. Government spokesman Georg Streiter said the heads of Germany's foreign and domestic intelligence agencies would participate. He did not give specific dates, saying that they would be arranged at \"relatively short notice\". White House spokesman Jay Carney said the Obama administration was discussing Germany's concerns \"through diplomatic channels at the highest level\", as it was with other U.S. allies worried about the alleged spying. 12.38pm BST Italy Lizzy Davies reports from Rome: Italy has been and \"probably still is\" the object of intensive communications monitoring by the British and United States intelligence services, Italian news magazine L'Espresso reports today (link to a preview of the piece), claiming that GCHQ's Tempora programme is so wide-ranging it \"recalls the imperial anthem Rule Britannia\". \"The earthquake has yet to come,\" it writes, raising expectations that documents from the Snowden files could soon be released in Italy. No new documents were published by the magazine, and, contrary to initial reports yesterday, there was no connection Glenn Greenwald to the article. L'Espresso says it has learned that British access to fibre-optic cables under the Mediterranean enables GCHQ to monitor Italian communications on a \"massive\" scale, sift the data and then share it with the NSA. The priorities of Tempora go beyond combating terrorism, with its scope including \"the political intentions of foreign governments\", trade deals, and any information to help support Britain's \"economic wellbeing\", L'Espresso adds. \"The British authorities' licence to spy is very large and allows for businesses, politicians and statesmen to be kept under control,\" it claims. The extent to which Italy's own intelligence services were aware of these activities remains unclear, L'Espresso says. It claims the Italians had a \"third party agreement\" with the British, but gave no further details. As the report emerged late on Thursday, the security services issued a statement to Italy's parliamentary committee for the intelligence and security services and for state secret control (Copasir) denying there was an agreement \"with the British intelligence services concerning the interception of communications via undersea cables.\" PM Enrico Letta, in Brussels for the EU summit, said Italy and other European nations wanted the truth on the allegations. \"It is not in the least bit conceivable that activity of this type could be acceptable,\" he said. Updated at 12.39pm BST 12.11pm BST Obama adviser: NSA not 'unrestrained' Lisa Monaco, Barack Obama’s assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism, has written a column for USA Today claiming that the NSA does not operate “unrestrained” – although, she says, the US’s capabilities are “unmatched”. We are not listening to every phone call or reading every e-mail. Far from it. There are legal limits to what the NSA can and cannot do, and the recent disclosures and additional documents the government has declassified prove just how seriously the NSA takes these limits. But she points out that Obama has ordered a review of surveillance capabilities – ”including with respect to our foreign partners. We want to ensure we are collecting information because we need it and not just because we can,” she says, echoing an unnamed official’s criticism of the Merkel bugging in the New York Times. Monaco concludes: Going forward, we will continue to gather the information we need to keep ourselves and our allies safe, while giving even greater focus to ensuring that we are balancing our security needs with the privacy concerns all people share. 12.06pm BST My colleague Simon Jenkins is scathing about the British parliamentary reaction to the NSA and GCHQ revelations. America's default mode is scepticism of such power and rightly so. And in Britain? Parliament is revealed as the bamboozled pawn of the very agencies it is charged with monitoring. Britons may yet have to rely on the US Congress to tell them what their own GCHQ is up to. Ministers assert that a debate welcomed by Barack Obama \"lethally threatens national security and puts lives at risk\". Yet all NSA stories have been published after discussions with the NSA, and/or the White House, to give them the opportunity to comment or to raise specific national security concerns. The ministerial charge, repeated by David Cameron, is flatly if privately denied by NSA sources in Washington. Now a Tory MP, Julian Smith, demands that the Guardian be prosecuted for its \"devastating impact on national security\". I would no more trust such MPs with my liberties than send them out for a pizza. The capacity of digital technology to expand human experience is clearly immense. So too is its capacity to menace us. We have yet to wrestle these two capacities into balance, but we must. The idea that such a balance is not fit for an informed debate is ridiculous. That parliament has become the agent for its suppression is outrageous. 11.55am BST Last night at the EU summit the UK was attempting to delay the implementation of new rules regulating how digital data can be transferred between Europe and America, and curbs on the abilities of US internet companies to keep European data in the US and make it available to the US, Ian Traynor reports. France and the European commission led the push for new European legislation on data protection by next spring, while Britain dragged its heels, arguing that it was more important to get the complex legislation right than to rush it through. \"The UK is leading the charge against it,\" a senior EU official said. \"The UK position is bewildering. They're trying to delay it.\" A French paper prepared for the summit, and obtained by the Guardian, said the NSA's operation of the Prism programme, revealed in June, \"brought to light the need to strengthen the rules ensuring the protection of the privacy of European citizens. An agreement needs to be achieved in October on the main provisions of the data protection package.\" But instead of calling on governments to agree on the new data privacy rules within a year, the deadline was extended to 2015, a victory for Britain. Updated at 5.05pm BST 11.48am BST The New York Times quotes a “career American official with long experience in Europe” as saying of the tapping of Merkel’s phone: “This was colossally bad judgment — doing something because you can, instead of asking if you should.” An administration official declined to say what Obama did or did not know about the monitoring, but said the president “doesn’t think we are in the right place”. The paper says that the US is coming round to the idea of a Five Eyes-style no-spying pact with Germany – “especially because American officials have difficulty making a credible case for what the United States has to gain from spying on senior German officials”. 11.35am BST EU leaders' statement Here is the full text of the statement by the 28 EU leaders on the US spying scandal: The Heads of State or Government discussed recent developments concerning possible intelligence issues and the deep concerns that these events have raised among European citizens. They underlined the close relationship between Europe and the USA and the value of that partnership. They expressed their conviction that the partnership must be based on respect and trust, including as concerns the work and cooperation of secret services. They stressed that intelligence gathering is a vital element in the fight against terrorism. This applies to relations between European countries as well as to relations with the USA. A lack of trust could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field of intelligence gathering. The Heads of State or Government took note of the intention of France and Germany to seek bilateral talks with the USA with the aim of finding before the end of the year an understanding on mutual relations in that field. They noted that other EU countries are welcome to join this initiative. They also pointed to the existing Working Group between the EU and the USA on the related issue of data protection and called for rapid and constructive progress in that respect.

Photograph: Francois Lenoir/Reuters Photograph: FRANCOIS LENOIR/REUTERS The BBC reported that David Cameron – whose own security services have been exposed by other Snowden leaks – was \"completely on board with the text\". Updated at 11.36am BST 11.24am BST France 'suspected US' Le Monde has today published an internal NSA document which it says shows the “tensions and distrust between Paris and Washington”, writes Angelique Chrisafis in Paris. The document, a preparatory note before a visit to the NSA by two top French intelligence officials in April 2013, shows that French officials suspected the US could have been behind a now well-known cyberattack on the French presidential computer network at the Elysée in May 2012. The hacking incident occurred just before the second round of the French presidential election, when Nicolas Sarkozy was still in power. Le Monde – in an article co-written by outgoing Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald – stated that the two French officials went to ask their American counterparts at the NSA for “an explanation”. The NSA document states that no US intelligence agency – or its close allies, the British services GCHQ or the Canadian services - were behind the electronic attack. The Elysee tightened its cyber-security after the May 2012 incident in which suspected detectors had been installed allowing access to information from the presidency and the hacking of presidential computers. \"The attack was not part of an act of sabotage which was to be made public but of the desire to be permanently installed invisibly at the centre of the presidency,\" an expert on the case told Le Monde. The paper said: “To attempt, or to appear, to prove their good faith, the NSA planned to send two analysts from the NTOC [the NSA's crisis centre] in March to assist the French in finding the attacker. On the eve of their departure, France cancelled their visit and hardened their tone demanding that [French intelligence officials] Bernard Barbier and Patrick Pailloux be given a hearing at the NSA on 12 April 2013. The internal NSA document notes that at no point did the French transmit the elements at their disposal concerning the possible responsibility of the Americans. 'Doubtless because the French want to see how the NSA responds when they present their findings,' states the memo as a hypothesis.\" The NSA documents show the US maintained it had no role in the cyberattack. The TAO service [Tailored access operation] which manages and carries out the NSA's cyber-attacks throughout the world confirmed that the attack did not concern any of its operations. The document specifies that \"TAO had asked most of the NSA's closest partners in the second circle (CIA, GCHQ and the CSEC [the Canadian services] were the main suspects) whether they were involved; all denied involvement\". 11.14am BST Here is a video of Merkel and Hollande talking about the spying scandals. 10.57am BST EU leaders' views Here is a round-up of what some of the EU’s leaders said about the surveillance scandal at the EU summit yesterday. Angela Merkel, German chancellor: It's become clear that for the future, something must change - and significantly. We will put all efforts into forging a joint understanding by the end of the year for the co-operation of the [intelligence] agencies between Germany and the US and France and the US, to create a framework for the co-operation … It's not just about me but about every German citizen. We need to have trust in our allies and partners, and this trust must now be established once again. I repeat that spying among friends is not at all acceptable against anyone, and that goes for every citizen in Germany. The United States has a \"no-spying\" deal with Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, an alliance known as \"Five Eyes\" that was formed after the second world war. But there has traditionally been a reluctance to make similar arrangements with other allies. Merkel said: We are in Afghanistan together. Our soldiers experience life threatening situations. They sometimes die in the same battle. The friendship and partnership between the European member states, including Germany, and the United States is not a one-way street. We depend on it. But there are good reasons that the United States also needs friends in the world. Francois Hollande, French president: What is at stake is preserving our relations with the United States. They should not be changed because of what has happened. But trust has to be restored and reinforced. Mark Rutte, Dutch prime minister: I will support [Merkel] completely in her complaint and say that this is not acceptable. I think we need all the facts on the table first. Enrico Letta, Italian prime minister We want the truth. It is not in the least bit conceivable that activity of this type could be acceptable. Fredrik Reinfeldt, the Swedish prime minister, called it \"completely unacceptable\" for a country to eavesdrop on an allied leader. Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European commission, said that eavesdropping on phone calls or emails was particularly objectionable because it recalled the totalitarian regimes of Europe’s recent past. He said: At least in Europe, we consider the right to privacy a fundamental right and it is a very serious matter. We cannot, let's say, pretend it is just something accessory. To speak about Chancellor Merkel, in Germany there was a part of Germany where there was a political police that was spying on people's lives every day [the East German Stasi]. So we know very recently what totalitarianism means. And we know very well what comes, what happens when the state uses powers that intrude in people's lives. So it is a very important issue, not only for Germany but for Europe in general. The Stasi archives office in Berlin. The secret police in the communist state were infamous for their spying on the population. Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images 10.19am BST Lord West Lord West of Spithead, who was a security minister under Gordon Brown, also spoke on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning about the latest surveillance revelations. West suggested that the revelations about the bugging of Merkel’s phone and her reaction was distracting from the real story: the “damage” Edward Snowden had done by leaking the NSA files. He said: What it has done is taken away attention from the real damage Snowden has done, which is actually listing names of good people who are now at risk and exposing techniques and ways of doing business by GCHQ and NSA that already people who wish to kill us are utilising to try and not get caught. He has, without doubt, made all of us less safe and that is a real worry. He added that he had \"always worked on the assumption\" that people were listening to his phone calls. \"I know they jolly well were, \" he said. I don't think it's surprising that people try and listen. If you are a head of state there are lots of people, not just other states, who are listening. There are companies, all sorts of people, who want to hear what you are saying and I think you have to be extremely careful. 9.46am BST Friday 25 October 2013 Good morning. The French and German governments have demanded talks with the US by the end of the year as the row over the spying activities of the US National Security Agency intensifies. The move follows reports that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had her phone monitored by the NSA and reports that the agency eavesdropped on calls made by members of the French administration. As Sam Jones and James Ball write the revelations are threatening to create a major rift between the US and its European allies. The former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such activities had to be curtailed. \"There is no reason to spy on Angela Merkel. It's a real scandal,\" he said. \"A new agreement is needed between the EU and the US; this cannot continue.\" Also today: • The Guardian revealed that National Security Agency monitored the phone conversations of 35 world leaders after being given the numbers by an official in another US government department, according to a classified document provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden. • International anger over US government surveillance has combined with a backlash against its current Middle East policy to leave Barack Obama increasingly isolated from many of his key foreign allies, according to diplomats in Washington, report Dan Roberts and Paul Lewis in Washington. The Guardian has spoken with several diplomats and foreign government officials – all of whom agreed to talk only on the condition of anonymity – who say the White House is still underestimating the anger felt over recent disclosures. They argue that US officials are being deliberately disingenuous when they claim that all countries engage in similar forms of espionage, even against allies. While it is widely accepted that the US, Britain, France, Russia and China engage in counter-espionage, other countries do not have the tools to conduct surveillance on the scale of the NSA. A European diplomat said that the White House had presented a false comparison by claiming all countries were engaged in the same tactics. \"How would the US respond if it discovered a friendly country was covertly listening to the calls of thousands of US citizens – including Obama?\" the diplomat said. • Former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden ended up on the wrong end of a surveillance stakeout on Thursday afternoon when, while riding a commuter train, he was overheard \"disparaging\" the Obama administration, Tom McCarthy reports from New York. Here Merkel responds yesterday to allegations the NSA bugged her phone. The German chancellor told reporters: This isn’t about me or my issues, but for every German citizen we need to trust in our allies, and this trust needs to be rebuilt and this mean thinking further about the kind of data privacy we need, about how transparent we are, the understanding between the authorities in America and Europe so we can meet the challenges together. But such a relationship can only be built on trust and that is why I repeat once again spying on friends is unacceptable. And here is cartoonist Steve Bell’s view. We'll have all this and more throughout the day today. Updated at 12.01pm BST 4.59pm BST Summary Key players have now arrived for the EU summit in Brussels. It is unclear how long the summit will last. I’m going to wrap up this live blog for the day with a summary of the day’s key events: • Angela Merkel has said that trust between the US and its partners will have to be “built anew” following reports that the US targeted the German chancellor’s mobile phone. Merkel spoke as she arrived at an EU summit in Brussels where US and UK surveillance is expected to be discussed – although concrete action from the EU may be unlikely. • US and British intelligence services have monitored Italian telecoms networks, targeting the government and companies as well as suspected terrorist groups, Italian weekly L'Espresso reported. • The White House has denied monitoring David Cameron's communications, according to the Daily Telegraph. • Lord Carlile, the former British terrorism watchdog, said the Guardian had committed a “criminal\" act by publishing stories based on Edward Snowden’s leaks, adding that it was wrong to present this newspaper’s journalists as “virtuous whistleblowers”. • Britain’s intelligence and security committee has announced that at 2pm on Thursday 7 November it will be holding an open evidence session with the heads of GCHQ, MI5, and MI6. In addition the British parliament is to hold a debate next Thursday on oversight of the UK’s spying agencies. That’s it from me for today. I’ll be back with more tomorrow. 4.41pm BST David Cameron arrived at the EU summit without saying anything to the press. 4.39pm BST The US's National Public Radio has put together this helpful summary of the Snowden revelations so far. Here's how it starts: What does the NSA monitor? — Metadata, which includes the records of several billion telephone calls made in the U.S. each day. The NSA does listen to the content of some of those phone calls. It also monitors the online and phone calls of foreign citizens. — Emails, instant messages and Facebook posts, as well as contact lists and raw internet traffic. Tech companies have denied giving the agency direct access to their servers, but the NSA paid them millions of dollars to cover the cost of complying with its requests. The final question was interesting too: Why are people overseas angry? There's no court that oversees the NSA's activities on foreign communications. The leaks have indicated that the agency not only spied on countries such as Iran, but also allies like France, Brazil, Mexico — and even UN diplomats. A key European parliament committee approved new rules this week strengthening online privacy and outlawing the kind of surveillance the U.S. has been conducting. Although foreign citizens may be angry, their governments' responses have been more muted. One possible reason: Snowden said it's likely some EU leaders knew about the operations. Updated at 4.40pm BST 4.16pm BST Merkel comments Arriving at today's EU summit, Angela Merkel said that trust between the US and its partners had to be restored following allegations that American intelligence targeted her mobile phone. The German chancellor said she told Barack Obama in a phone call that \"spying among friends cannot be\". She said there needed to be trust among allies and partners and \"such trust now has to be built anew\". Updated at 4.53pm BST 4.01pm BST Italy US and British intelligence services have monitored Italian telecoms networks, targeting the government and companies as well as suspected terrorist groups, Italian weekly L'Espresso reported today. \"The NSA has many spying operations, also on European governments and including the Italian government,\" outgoing Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald told L'Espresso in a preview of an article due to be published in full on Friday. The report is based on evidence from Edward Snowden. The summary issued today did not contain specific evidence but said documents held by Snowden \"contain a great deal of information on the control of Italian telecommunications which will be released in the next few weeks\". Reuters reports: As well as surveillance under the US Prism programme, a separate programme dubbed Tempora and run by Britain's GCHQ also spied on telephone, internet and email traffic carried through three undersea fibre-optic cables in Sicily, L'Espresso said. It said British intelligence services sought information in Italy to protect British economic interests as well as to identify \"the political intentions of foreign governments\" including on military affairs. In addition to information on nuclear, chemical and biological arms proliferation, British priorities included advanced military technology which could include legitimate Italian trade deals with Arab countries, the magazine said. The report said Italian intelligence services had knowledge of the information collected by the British under an information sharing agreement but it gave no details. No comment was immediately available from Italian intelligence officials. 3.27pm BST Hollywood's Oliver Stone, Maggie Gyllenhaal and John Cusack have appeared in a video promoting a rally against mass surveillance scheduled to take place this Saturday in Washington, DC. The video compares the revelations based on Edward Snowden's leaks with the Watergate burglary and cover-up that brought down Richard Nixon. 2.45pm BST Lord Carlile, the former British terrorism watchdog, has said the Guardian has committed a “criminal\" act, adding that it was wrong to present this newspaper’s journalists as “virtuous whistleblowers”. In a speech at the University of Sussex Carlile claimed that by disclosing information from Edward Snowden about surveillance methods, the Guardian had “given away how we catch terrorists” and “put people in danger”. He said police should have arrested David Miranda, the partner of outgoing Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, when they detained him at Heathrow airport, and launched a full investigation. Although the police did not arrest Miranda, they did announce a criminal investigation into the material taken from him at Heathrow airport, which is still ongoing. Carlile argued that the publication of information Miranda was holding could have “put back for years” the struggle against global terrorism. His words suggest whatever information he was referring to was not actually published by the Guardian, and the paper has made clear since it began to publish stories based on documents leaked by Snowden that it has carefully weighed up what it should and should not publish, usually after discussion with the relevant governments. The Daily Telegraph quotes Carlile as saying: David Miranda, his partner Glenn Greenwald, Edward Snowden and the Guardian claim to be virtuous whistleblowers. Their virtue apparently includes travelling the world and publishing or seeking to publish secrets collected by the UK and other countries to protect their citizens. What kind of virtue is that? Mr Snowden has provided and the Guardian has published material that allegedly shows where and how the UK is functioning against terrorism. Is it anything other than criminal to seek to publish such secrets? In my view most right-thinking people would condemn Mr Snowden’s activities and question the actions of journalists whose newspapers may benefit from his wrongdoing. It is worth investigating whether there were any conspiracies to breach the Official Secrets Act. Of course, the Guardian is not subject to the Official Secrets Act but if the Guardian had conspired with anyone who is subject to the Official Secrets Act then they would be potentially guilty of an inchoate crime of conspiracy and indeed there may be other crimes that could be alleged. My understanding is that they are being investigated at the present time and it will be in due course for the CPS to decide, if the case is sent to the CPS, whether any crime can be brought before a court. Mr Miranda was carrying electronic equipment, apparently including an electronic games device that could have contained a mass of secret information in digital form. Its publication could have resulted in disastrous undermining of the legitimate efforts of secret investigations, perhaps putting back for years the struggle against worldwide political violence. How could David Cameron or Theresa May have vetoed a search that might have protected Londoners from another bus or tube bombing?

Its head, Thomas Oppermann, said he was informed that Der Spiegel had confronted the chancellery with documents on the matter, that the suspicion of surveillance was reviewed and found to be \"plausible\". Der Spiegel has published material from NSA leaker Edward Snowden, but didn't detail its sources on the phone story. Recalling previous reports to the panel that US authorities have said they didn't violate German interests, Oppermann said before the meeting that \"we were apparently deceived by the American side\". 2.28pm BST Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande are to hold a one-on-one meeting before the start of the summit this afternoon to discuss the issue of US espionage. 2.23pm BST Here is a video of Sigmar Gabriel, the leader of the German Social Democrats, who says: The NSA scandal is far from over as some claimed during the [German] election campaign. In fact it is even bigger than we thought until now. I am convinced that a European response is needed. The Americans must respect basic rights and freedoms laid down in our constitution and in European treaties. His party is currently engaged in coalition negotiations with Merkel's Christian Democrats and he could end up being given the position of vice-chancellor. Updated at 2.33pm BST 2.07pm BST Britain’s intelligence and security committee has announced that at 2pm on Thursday 7 November it will be holding an open evidence session with the heads of GCHQ, MI5, and MI6. Sir Iain Lobban, Andrew Parker, and Sir John Sawers, will appear at the committee’s first open evidence session, although it will be broadcast on a time delay “to allow the committee to pause the broadcast if anything is mentioned which might endanger national security or the safety of those working for the agencies”. “It will be the first time the three heads of the intelligence agencies have appeared in public together to talk about their work,” the committee said in a statement, adding: The session will give an insight into the world of intelligence, and the work the agencies do on behalf of the UK. It represents a very significant step forward in terms of the openness and transparency of the agencies. The committee will question the agency heads on the work of the agencies, their current priorities and the threats to the UK. Among other things it will cover the terrorist threat, regional instability and weapons proliferation, cyber-security and espionage. However, since this is a public session, it will not cover details of intelligence capabilities or techniques, ongoing operations or sub judice matters. The committee questions the agencies about these details in their closed sessions. Updated at 2.59pm BST 1.49pm BST Hans-Christoph Quelle, one of the founders of company whose encryption service the chancellor has used since 2009, has told my colleague Philip Oltermann that it was \"out of the question\" that Angela Merkel's current phone had been bugged. Merkel is said to have used a new Secusmart BlackBerry, which uses a chip inside the phone itself to carry out encryption, since September this year. \"It's completely safe, and there's no 'back door',\" Quelle said. But he said it was harder to judge whether bugging had been taking place between 2009 and 2013, when Merkel was using an older type of encryption software. The old and the new phones used by the German government allowed users to switch between 'safe' and 'unsafe' communication. In order to have a completely safe conversation, speakers on both ends of the line needed to use the same technology. \"We can't rule out that Merkel may have had some conversations that weren't encrypted,\" he said. Secusmart have used the term \"Kanzler-Handy\", first coined by a newspaper, to advertise the phone in its press releases. Quelle said there were \"no plans\" to ditch the term. 1.46pm BST The British parliament is to hold a debate next Thursday on oversight of the UK’s spying agencies, Nicholas Watt and Rowena Mason write. The debate, which will be held in Westminster Hall, was granted after an application by Julian Huppert, the Liberal Democrat MP and civil liberties campaigner, Tom Watson, the Labour MP who investigated phone hacking, and Dominic Raab, the Tory MP who led a rebellion against the communications data bill, otherwise known as the \"snooper's charter\". The debate will be held next Thursday afternoon and follows one led by Tory MP Julian Smith to highlight his call to the Metropolitan police to investigate whether the Guardian has broken the law. (See earlier in this blog for a report on that.) Labour MP David Winnick told the House of Commons the claims about Merkel's phone showed it was right for parliament to hold a debate on an \"orchestrated campaign of intimidation\" against the Guardian over its publication of stories based on Edward Snowden's leaks. Winnick said the allegations about the monitoring of Merkel's mobile telephone would not have been aired without the Snowden leaks: Would the leader [of the Commons] agree that if we had a debate in the chamber on the orchestrated campaign of intimidation against the Guardian newspaper, that would be an opportunity for some of us to point out that if it hadn't been for the Snowden disclosures the fact that the German chancellor's mobile phone had been monitored for some time by the US intelligence gathering would not have been known? Surely the message should be about Snowden; let's have more disclosures because undoubtedly what the Guardian is publishing is in the national interest. Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader of the Commons, replied: Clearly I don't agree with him in terms of what he says is an orchestrated campaign against the Guardian newspaper. I think clearly there is a need for the issues of public interest the Guardian wants to highlight to be balanced with any security implications of any material they put out into the public domain. 12.32pm BST Michel Barnier, the French European commissioner for financial regulation, has been posting about the NSA revelations on Twitter in English and French: #NSA: too much is too much. Between friends, there must be trust. It has been shaken. We expect answers from Americans quickly. @France2tv — Michel Barnier (@MBarnierEU) October 24, 2013 #NSA trop c'est trop, la confiance est ébranlée! USA doit apporter réponses précises. mb 4Vérités @francetvinfo @France2tv #EUCO — Michel Barnier (@MBarnierEU) October 24, 2013 12.04pm BST The pressure group Index on Censorship is demanding the EU take action on mass surveillance at its summit today. The group has delivered a petition to that effect to Herman van Rompuy, the president of the European council, signed by Stephen Fry, Bianca Jagger, AL Kennedy, Anish Kapoor, Cory Doctorow and others. Firector of campaigns Marek Marczynski said: If Angela Merkel does not like the idea of having her phone monitored by the NSA then she needs to do something about it. It’s time for the EU’s leaders to condemn and put an end to the mass surveillance of European citizens’ private communications by the NSA, GCHQ and other government agencies. They must act now to stop these attacks on our rights to freedom of speech and privacy. 11.54am BST Downing Street has refused to comment on whether the UK government has been given assurances by the United States that David Cameron's communications had not been monitored in the wake of allegations American spies had targeted German chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone. At a regular briefing for journalists in Westminster the PM's official spokesman said: \"I'm not going to comment on matters of security or intelligence.\" 11.16am BST The former head of France's secret services, Bernard Squarcini, is taking a more worldly view than Merkel or Hollande. He told Le Figaro: I'm bewildered by such worrying naivite. You'd think the politicians don't read the reports they're sent - there shouldn't be any surprise. The agencies know perfectly well that every country, even when they cooperate on anti-terrorism, spies on its allies. The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level like we spy on them, because it's in the national interest to defend our businesses. No one is fooled. 11.14am BST A Reuters report casts doubt on the idea that today's European Council summit would lead to concrete changes to the US and EU's relationship regarding spying. President Francois Hollande has made clear he plans to put the spying issue on the summit agenda, although it is not clear what that will ultimately achieve. While Berlin and Paris are likely to find sympathy among many of the EU's 28 member states, domestic security issues are not a competence of the European Union. The best that may be hoped for is an expression of support from leaders and calls for a full explanation from the United States. However, the news agency points out that the accusations could encourage member states to back tough data privacy rules being drafted by the European Union. The European parliament approved this week an amended package of legislation that would overhaul EU data protection rules that date from 1995. This would restrict how data collected in Europe by firms such as Google and Facebook is shared with non-EU countries, introduce the right of EU citizens to request that their digital traces be erased from the internet, and impose fines of up to €100m (£85m or $138m) on rulebreakers. The United States is concerned that the regulations, if they enter into law, will raise the cost of doing business and handling data in Europe. Google, Yahoo!, Microsoft and others have lobbied hard against the proposals. Given the spying accusations, France and Germany - the two most influential countries in EU policy - may succeed in getting member states to push ahead on negotiations with the parliament to complete the regulations and make them tough. That could mean an agreement is reached early next year, with the laws possibly coming into force in 2015. For the United States, this could substantially change how data privacy rules are implemented globally. It may also complicate relations between the United States and the EU over an agreement to share a large amount of data collected via Swift, the international system used for transferring money electronically, which is based in Europe. Among the revelations from Snowden's leaks is that the United States may have violated the Swift agreement, accessing more data than it was allowed to. The European parliament voted on Wednesday to suspend the Swift agreement and the spying accusations may make EU member states support a firm line, complicating the United States' ability to collect data that it says is critical in combatting terrorism.

Photograph: Vincent Kessler/Reuters Photograph: Vincent Kessler/Reuters Updated at 11.15am BST 11.07am BST My colleague Nicholas Watt writes that in the British parliament Labour MP David Winnick has just stood up to say that the bugging of Merkel's phone would never have been discovered without Edward Snowden drawing attention to these issues. He'll have more shortly. Winnick was one of the MPs who spoke in support of the Guardian in the parliamentary debate on Tuesday into whether the paper had endangered UK national security. Updated at 11.14am BST 11.00am BST Sigmar Gabriel, the leader of Germany's Social Democrats - the party currently in coalition talks with Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats - has said it would be hard to imagine a agreeing a free trade deal with the US if the US is infringing citizens' rights and privacy. More details soon ... 10.50am BST Europe cannot return to business as usual with Washington following the Merkel allegations, Germany’s defence minister said earlier this morning. Thomas de Maiziere told ARD television the alleged surveillance would be “really bad” if confirmed. He said: The Americans are and remain our best friends, but this is absolutely not right. I have reckoned for years with my cellphone being monitored, but I wasn't reckoning with the Americans. We can't simply return to business as usual. There are allegations in France too. But he added that \"the relations between our countries are stable and important for our future; they will remain that way.\" But there are criticisms in Germany that Merkel and her government played down earlier reports of US surveillance of German citizens, only to react strongly now when the surveillance appears to have affected the prime minister personally. \"It's absolute impudence if it's true that the US monitors even the heads of government of close friends,\" said Anton Hofreiter, a leader of the opposition Greens' parliamentary group. \"But it was, of course, also impudence on the part of our government to be completely relaxed so long as ... it only affected the country's citizens, and to make a big fuss now that it is affected.\" The following tweet expresses the same sentiment: Being German, I do not understand why gov says it's okay when NSA spies on all Germans but not okay when NSA spies on chancellor Merkel #nsa — Oliver Bartz (@Tomcat0815) October 24, 2013 10.45am BST The US ambassador to Germany, John B Emerson, is expected to meet foreign minister Guido Westerwelle this afternoon, the Associated Press reports. The German foreign ministry said Westerwelle would \"spell out the position of the German governemnt\". The US embassy had no comment. 10.39am BST US denies spying on Cameron The White House has denied monitoring David Cameron's communications, according to the Daily Telegraph. Caitlin Hayden, a spokesman for the National Security Council said: \"We do not monitor PM Cameron's communications.\" Asked if the US had ever spied on Mr Cameron in the past, she replied: \"No\". 9.56am BST And here Julian Borger points out that Obama's conversation with Merkel was the third time in a week he had found himself trying to placate the leaders of closely allied nations who have discovered the extent of NSA surveillance in their countries. As the flood of spying scandals threatens to engulf the White House, it has raised the question over whether the negotiating edge such secret eavesdropping provides is worth the reputational damage to Washington once it is secret no more, mostly as a result of the revelations of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. With each leak, American soft power haemorrhages, and hard power threatens to seep away with it ... Yet nothing could be more personal for a foreign leader than to find their own mobile phones tapped by a nation they considered an essential friend and ally. That appears to be the case for Angela Merkel, as it has been for Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto. The other humiliating phone call of the week was on Monday with François Hollande, whose phone was not bugged as far as he knew, but who demanded an explanation for the revelation – once more from the Snowden files – that the NSA had been recording tens of millions of French phone calls a month. The White House was forced to admit that the evidence raised \"legitimate questions for our friends and allies\". He adds: \"It is clear from the trove of documents leaked by Snowden that the only protection against NSA or GCHQ intrusion is membership of Five Eyes: the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. New members do not seem to be welcome, and the lesson is that outside that tight circle, it does not matter how senior you are, and how close a friend you think you are to Washington or London, your communications could easily be being shared among the handful of white, English-speaking nations with membership privileges.\" 9.54am BST Here Philip Oltermann reports that Merkel is such an enthusiastic user of her mobile that she is called \"die Handy-Kanzlerin\" – Handy being the German word for mobile phone. With so much diplomacy happening directly on the chancellor's mobile, security services have increasingly tried to make her phone safe from bugging. In 2009, it was reported that Merkel had fitted her Nokia with an encryption chip by Düsseldorf IT company Secusmart. As many as 5,250 other ministers, advisers and important civil servants were supplied with similar state-of-the-art encryption technology. 9.52am BST In this video, White House spokesman Jay Carney tells press that Obama has assured Merkel that her phone is not currently being tapped and will not be in future. Updated at 9.52am BST 9.49am BST German reaction Philip Oltermann sends this round-up of reaction from the German press and key figures from Berlin: In the Süddeutsche Zeitung, Robert Rossmann writes that the allegations put the spotlight on Obama and the NSA. “When he visited Germany, the American president had flamboyantly promised more trustful collaboration between the countries. Even Merkel seems to have lost faith in that promise by now. One doesn't dare imagine how Obama's secret services deal with enemy states, when we see how they treat their closest allies. Barack Obama is not a Nobel Peace Prize Winner, he is a troublemaker.” Die Zeit writes that Obama's “half-hearted denial” of the allegations raised more new questions that it answered: “Was Merkel's mobile the target of NSA surveillance in the past?” The paper adds: “It is time for Obama and the US Congress to be ruthlessly transparent about the macabre practices of the NSA and restrain them strongly. They promised it months ago, but until recently very little has happened. With each revelation trust is eroded further. If America wants to stop annoying its friends and allies, it only has one option: get on the front foot and be open.” In the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Georg Mascolo and Ben Scott warn of the creation of a “digital Maginot line” between Europe and the US, and instead call for a “no spy treaty” between European countries. “Storing data and surveillance would only be allowed for previously agreed goals – the fight against terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as well as grave acts of crime. All forms of political and economic espionage would be banned. The privacy of every EU citizen has be respected by each EU secret service as if they were their own.” Germany's data protection commissioner Peter Schaar said that the reports shows “the absurdity of politicians trying to draw to a close the debate about surveillance of everyday communication here.” He went as far as saying that it had been “irresponsible” of politicians not to be more upfront in calling for the US to clear up the matter.” Anke Domscheit-Berg of the German Pirate Party, told the Guardian: \"In the past few months, chancellor Merkel did very little to make the US government answer all those questions that should have had highest political priority. Now she gets a taste of what it feels like when foreign secret services spy on all your communication. We have stopped trusting empty promises and so should Angela Merkel. It is about time to get all dirty secrets on the table.” 9.43am BST Thursday 24 October 2013 Good morning. • The German foreign minister has summoned the US ambassador, John B Emerson, following reports that the US National Security Agency was monitoring Angela Merkel’s mobile phone. The German chancellor on Wednesday evening called Barack Obama to demand an explanation and was said to be “livid” and convinced, on the basis of a German intelligence investigation, that the reports were utterly substantiated. Merkel’s spokesman said that she had also voiced exasperation at the slowness of the Americans to respond to detailed questions on the NSA scandal since the Edward Snowden revelations first appeared in the Guardian in June. The White House responded by saying that the US “is not monitoring and will not monitor” Merkel’s phone – but conspicuously refused to rule out that such monitoring had taken place in the past. • The row comes as an EU summit in Brussels opens this afternoon. French president François Hollande – who also called the White House to confront Obama this week, in his case over reports the NSA was targeting the private phone calls and text messages of millions of French people – has insisted that US surveillance be raised at the summit, which, by coincidence, is largely devoted to the \"digital\" economy in Europe. The French demand for had gained little traction in Europe, but by last night that had shifted radically, with the Germans publicly insisting that the activities of the US intelligence services in Europe be put on a new legal basis. \"The [German] federal government, as a close ally and partner of the USA, expects in the future a clear contractual basis for the activity of the services and their cooperation,\" Merkel told Obama. We’ll be following all this and more live throughout the day today. Updated at 9.57am BST 4.20pm BST Tech lobbying Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and other tech giants are taking part in a new lobbying push regarding government surveillance, reports Tony Romm on Politico. The companies’ aim with the new D.C. effort isn’t entirely clear. Silicon Valley to date hasn’t pushed to restrict the NSA’s ability to reach into the Internet’s backbone for foreign suspects’ communications. Instead, the tech companies mostly have made the case for more transparency — the need for better numbers and clearer documents that show how often the government seeks data from them and when. But continued revelations about U.S. surveillance have raised the potential for new regulation of Internet companies in Europe and beyond. That’s causing headaches for tech companies that store and swap data overseas. Any changes to U.S. surveillance law consequently could have broad impact on business, and Silicon Valley is closely monitoring the congressional action. 9.44am BST Wednesday 23 October 2013 Here are today's headlines: • European leaders are under pressure to respond to the controversy over mass digital surveillance after the European parliament moved to toughen data privacy rules and curb data transfers to the US, and following outrage in France at the scale of the intrusion. The draft supported by MEPs on Monday forms the basis for further negotiation with the 28 EU governments and the European commission, meaning it is likely to be altered substantially before coming into force. The aim is to have the new regime agreed by next spring and in force by 2016, but that looks unlikely. The 28 governments are still trying to reach a common negotiating position. • As reported here yesterday, Tory MP Julian Smith said the Guardian had broken the law and should be prosecuted. Rowena Mason has the full story here. Here is a trailer for an upcoming documentary on the NSA Files produced by the Guardian. 6.14pm BST The Guardian has put out a statement in response to the claims Julian Smith made during the debate: Unfortunately, Julian Smith's speech propagated a series of myths about the Guardian's reporting of the Snowden documents. When responsible journalists working on the same story share documents they are engaged in journalism, not terrorism. Senior politicians and government officials in the UK and internationally, over 30 of the world’s leading newspaper editors, and an overwhelming majority of the public have all said that the Guardian's reporting on this story is important for democracy. They all agree, as does Mr Smith, that surveillance of citizens by intelligence agencies is a legitimate subject for debate. But there would be no public debate had there been no disclosure. 5.22pm BST That's it from me for the day. I'll be back tomorrow with more. 5.02pm BST The debate breaks up on time at 5pm, with many members very unhappy that only Smith and Brokenshire were able to say anything substantive. 5.01pm BST Winnick points out that in the US the Guardian's revelations have led to a wide-ranging inquiry, and they \"certainly have been in the national interest\". 4.59pm BST Brokenshire claims the security services have neither the interest nor the capability to listen in or read everyone's phone calls or emails. And everything they do is compatible with EU law, he claims. 4.57pm BST There is a pressing need to ensure our police and intelloigence services' capabilities keep pace with technology, he says, suggesting the communications data bill could be back on the table. 4.56pm BST Any leak is serious and can give help to terrorists, Brokenshire claims. 4.56pm BST Brokenshire says the government was concerned about the Guardian holding confidential material \"insecurely\". This was why the government asked the newspaper to return or destroy its files. He says he appreciates newspapers can believe they are doing the right thing, but they are not in the position to make such assessments. The government strongly supports a free press, he says. 4.55pm BST Brokenshire claims that when it was discovered that Osama bin Laden's emails could be read, \"we did not hear from him again until September 2001\". He gives way to David Davis. Why has nobody been charged, Davis asks. Brokenshire says it is not for ministers to arrest people. That is for the police and CPS. There is an ongoing police investigation into the detention of Miranda, he says. 4.53pm BST Brokenshire also mentions Oliver Robbins's comments on the information Miranda had when he was detained. Brokenshire keeps reading his speech despite a number of MPs trying to chip in. \"He's like a robot,\" says Winnick. 4.51pm BST Home Office minister James Brokenshire speaks next, to say Snowden's actions and the publication of them have damaged national security. The prime minister has endorsed MI5 head Andrew Parker's speech on this, Brokenshire says. He reads from Parker's speech, suggesting that terrorists have been aided by the publication of the stories. Winnick says that the minister should give way from time to time. 4.49pm BST He says there is the danger of a terrible precedent being set. \"What a disgraceful speech,\" says Winnick. \"You're a rude man,\" says Smith. 4.48pm BST He says he has written to the Met police and he urges ministers to act quickly and to get all files the Guardian has and decrypt them. 4.47pm BST The Terrorism Act is very clear about communicating information about intelligence staff, as is the Official Secrets Act, Smith says. 4.46pm BST Smith reads for the Independent's leader column explaining why it would not run any more Snowden stories, and from a Glenn Greenwald tweet saying: @peterkofod As for NYT, I had no role at all in that – those were 1 set of docs only about UK that G had. They made that choice without me. 4.44pm BST The MP interrupting earlier was Labour's David Winnick. 4.44pm BST \"Outright McCarthyism!\" David Winnick says. Smith claims Appelbaum chivvied the Guardian into publishing its story on the Tor network more quickly than planned. Updated at 5.02pm BST 4.42pm BST It seems highly likely the Guardian has risked our security several times over, Smith says, to cries of \"rubbish\" , \"nonsense\" and \"hysterical scaremongering\" from other MPs. 4.41pm BST This is an orchestrated campaign against the Guardian to try to smear it as helping terrorists, David Winnick interjects. Updated at 4.45pm BST 4.40pm BST Since 9/11 the intelligence game has changed, Smith says. 4.40pm BST He says we have some of the best oversight of security services in the world. He says he wants to discuss where the Guardian has crossed the line. And he pays tribute to former MP Louise Mensch for keeping the issue alive on social media. 4.38pm BST The Guardian has done no whistleblowing on GCHQ and exposed no illegality, he says. He claims he would be making the same argument were it the Telegraph or the Times under the spotlight. 4.37pm BST Smith is asked whether he can be interpreted as attacking the Guardian because of its work exposing phone-hacking and thus kickstarting the Leveson process. Smith denies it. 4.37pm BST The Guardian was right to report in some ways on the NSA files, he says. 4.36pm BST Smith says the Guardian has passed files to the New York Times - making copies and sending them overseas. This is not about muzzling the press, Smith says. 4.35pm BST Smith says the WikiLeaks hacker Jacob Appelbaum has talked about the flaws in the Guardian's areas where secure documents are kept. Raab interrupts to say that for all of the scaremongering about national security if Miranda or the Guardian had endangered national security why has no one been charged? Smith says if you look at the witness statements for the court case someone may be charged. Updated at 5.03pm BST 4.34pm BST David Davis interrupts to ask if he is not concerned that these secrets are available to so many government contractors such as Edward Snowden. Smith says he agrees \"it was a very odd situation\". 4.33pm BST Smith says Oliver Robbins, Britain's deputy national security adviser, has spoken of the danger from the files Miranda had on him. There was a real fear that terrorists would try to access that information by targeting the Guardian, he says. 4.32pm BST Smith recalls David Miranda's detention at Heathrow this summer. He claims the Guardian's story that Miranda was detained simply for being Glenn Greenwald's partner had quickly \"unravelled\". He mentions the court case relating to Miranda's detention. 4.31pm BST Julian Smith opens the debate. He says the debate focuses on the editors of the Guardian \"copying, trafficking and distributing files\" on GCHQ which \"may identify\" intelligence personnel, \"risking their lives and those of their families\". 4.29pm BST Former shadow home secretary David Davis, who has criticised the lack of oversight that the Guardian's revelations have exposed, has also arrived. Updated at 4.29pm BST 4.26pm BST Julian Smith, the Tory MP who prompted the debate, has taken his seat, as has Dominic Raab, a Conservative MP who has taken the Guardian's side on this issue. 4.19pm BST You can watch the debate live here. MPs are currently discussing Coventry City football club. 4.14pm BST Parliamentary debate I’m here in a committee room off Westminster Hall in the Houses of Parliament, where the debate on the Guardian and national security is due to start at 4.30pm. 3.19pm BST US columnist revises view In the US, Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen has revised his early, critical views of Edward Snowden, whom he once denounced as “ridiculously cinematic”,“narcissistic”, and not a real whistleblower. Today he writes: Whatever Snowden is, he is curiously modest and has bent over backward to ensure that the information he has divulged has done as little damage as possible. As a “traitor,” he lacks the requisite intent and menace … The early denunciations of Snowden now seem both over the top and beside the point. If he is a traitor, then which side did he betray and to whom does he now owe allegiance? … Snowden’s residency in Russia has been forced upon him — he had nowhere else to go. Those people who insist he should come home and go to jail lack a healthy regard for the rigors of imprisonment. After a while it can be no fun. He admits that he underestimated the importance of what Snowden had leaked: My initial column on Snowden was predicated on the belief that, really, nothing he revealed was new. Didn’t members of Congress know all this stuff and hadn’t much of it leaked? Yes, that’s largely true. But my mouth is agape at the sheer size of these data-gathering programs — a cascade of news stories that leads me to conclude that this very column was known to the National Security Agency before it was known to my editors. I also wrote that “No one lied about the various programs” Snowden disclosed. But then we found out that James Clapper did. The director of national intelligence was asked at a Senate hearing in March if “the story that we have millions or hundreds of millions of dossiers on people is completely false” and he replied that it was. Actually, it was his answer that was “completely false.” And he now believes Snowden was a whistleblower: I am sure that police powers granted the government will be abused over time and that Snowden is an authentic whistleblower, appalled at what he saw on his computer screen and wishing, like Longfellow’s Paul Revere, to tell “every Middlesex village and farm” what our intelligence agencies were doing. Who do they think they are, Google? Updated at 3.38pm BST 2.36pm BST ComRes poll Pressure group Big Brother Watch has commissioned a ComRes poll which finds that the public overwhelmingly backs a debate on surveillance. The poll found 71% believed it was in the public interest for there to be a debate about surveillance laws, while just 7% disagreed. In addition, 47% said they would prefer judges, rather than politicians, to be involved in the authorisation of surveillance warrants. Nick Pickles, director of the pressure group, said: Our surveillance laws were written when Facebook did not exist and when few people had smartphones or broadband internet. It is only sensible for parliament to revisit our current laws and ensure they are relevant for a digital age and the public clearly back such a debate as being in the public interest. ComRes interviewed 2,018 people. Recent polls have provided a mixed picture of the public’s attitude towards surveillance and the Guardian’s revelations. As John Naughton reported on Sunday, a recent YouGov poll asked respondents whether the British security services had too many or too few powers to carry out surveillance on ordinary people. Forty-two per cent said that they thought the balance was \"about right\" and a further 22% thought that the security services did not have enough powers. Respondents were also asked whether they thought Snowden's revelations were a good or a bad thing; 43% thought they were bad and only 35% thought they were good. 2.30pm BST Natalie Bennett, the leader of the Green party and former Guardian journalist, has written a piece in defence of the paper for website politics.co.uk. She says Edward Snowden’s revelations are being taken “very seriously indeed … almost everywhere except Britain”. Instead, we've seen a concerted attack from other press on the Guardian (no, I'm not going to give them the traffic by linking to them, but you know who they are). This [afternoon] we'll see a debate in the Commons called by backbench Tory MP Julian Smith on The Guardian newspaper and its impact on national security. It seems the Commons home affairs committee (supposed to scrutinise the government) is, on the suggestion of the prime minister, also going to investigate a similar topic. Shooting the messenger has a very long history. Plutarch tells us about Tigranes, who on being told bad news chopped off the messenger's head and subsequently knew nothing of future threats. Since we've already got cause for grave concerns about the behaviour of our security services, we need to encourage revelations of wrongdoing - encourage, indeed force, openness into some very dark corners indeed. We should not be attempting to stamp on the messengers. 12.26pm BST Blunkett says we do need to debate whether we want this kind of surveillance – \"I think we do\". 12.25pm BST Former home secretary David Blunkett is also on the programme. He says it is important to have the debate but we can't rely on the Guardian or any other paper to decide what information should be published. He claims the information will undermine the work of our security services. But he says Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger has acted responsibly. Updated at 12.29pm BST 12.24pm BST Smith is asked about Francois Hollande's complaints to Barack Obama about US surveillance. Smith says he hasn't challenged the right of the Guardian to publish information in a responsible way using the D [DA] Notice system. But it is wrong, he says, that the Guardian has these documents and it is unsafe. Updated at 12.29pm BST 12.23pm BST Huppert says the best way to strengthen national security is to have the open discussion about what the security services are doing. This has been said by former spy chiefs, he points out. 12.23pm BST Huppert says the Guardian has been very careful not to put information about individuals out there. Smith complained about the PowerPoint slides the Guardian published. Huppert says these were the key pieces of evidence. The public debate the Guardian has opened is essential, he says. But not at the expense of national security, says Smith. He says the Guardian has a \"major stain\" on it today. 12.21pm BST Huppert points out that he is asking for a parliamentary debate on oversight of the security and intelligence services. Smith says there is a public interest about having a debate but he says \"the Guardian has gone beyond this\". Again he says the paper \"allegedly\" sent details abroad. Updated at 12.29pm BST 12.20pm BST Smith there is a darker side to this story, claiming the Guardian has \"potentially\" sent information about GCHQ staff overseas in a \"vulnerable\" way. Huppert says he has not seen anything in what the Guardian has published that would be a gift for terrorists. Instead the Guardian has opened an important public debate, he says. 12.19pm BST Julian Smith and Julian Huppert are speaking now on BBC2's The Daily Politics. 12.13pm BST Lib Dem Julian Huppert takes a different view. Lots of press ... First up, daily politics about whether the Guardian should be prosecuted for publishing Snowden info. Answer: no #fb — Julian Huppert (@julianhuppert) October 22, 2013 12.07pm BST Julian Smith has also written a piece for the Politics Home website explaining why he believes MPs should be debating the Guardian’s actions today. He says that “the Guardian was right to report in some way on the NSA files having received them. If journalism – receiving, and reporting on, leaks, were all that the Guardian did, parliament and MI5 would not now be involved.” What concerns him is his claim that “the editors of the Guardian [stepped] beyond any reasonable definition of journalism into allegedly copying, trafficking and distributing files on GCHQ – information which would not only endanger Britain’s national security, but also may identify personnel currently working in our intelligence services, risking their lives and those of their families – to American papers and bloggers, and around the world.” Smith claims he is not arguing that the press should be muzzled, says he supports a re-examination of intelligence gathering and oversight of the security services, and acknowledges that Edward Snowden – for his NSA revelations at least – can be considered a whistleblower. But he claims this term does not apply to the Guardian’s stories about GCHQ: The Guardian has done no whistleblowing on GCHQ, and exposed no illegality. Story after story in their paper has been forced to concede they have found no evidence whatsoever that our intelligence forces have broken British law. But they have endangered them all the same. 11.53am BST Smith v Starmer Julian Smith, the Tory MP who has prompted today's Westminster Hall debate on whether the Guardian endangered national security, has written to the attorney general to express his \"shock and alarm\" at the interview director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer gave to this paper last week. In the interview, Starmer launched a robust defence of journalists who break the law pursuing investigations that have a genuine public interest. Smith wrote to attorney general Dominic Grieve: I am writing to express my shock and alarm that Keir Starmer, the director of public prosecutions, both gave an interview to the Guardian but also commented on the ongoing revelations that the Guardian is making with regard to stolen leaks by Edward Snowden, appearing to express on a number of levels support for the Guardian's actions. I understand that the Guardian is at least a witness if not a protagonist in a current criminal investigation. This intervention by the DPP risks jeopardising the ongoing Metropolitan police criminal investigation and is a major breach of basic sub-judice principles. I want to put on the record my deep regret that the DPP made these comments and made them in a newspaper that I understand is currently subject to legal proceedings. After Glenn Greenwald’s partner David Miranda was detained in August, the Metropolitan police announced a criminal investigation into the material taken from him at Heathrow airport. The attorney general's office and the Crown Prosecution Service have been contacted for comment. 11.29am BST Greenwald: 'more to come' Glenn Greenwald, the outgoing Guardian reporter who wrote many of the paper's NSA scoops, promised yesterday that there were many more to come, including details about the US spying on its own citizens – the strand which has caused the most controversy in America itself. Greenwald spoke by video link to a group of reporters from the Americas meeting in Denver. He said that the upcoming revelations would be as significant as this week's Le Monde stories on surveillance of French phone records. The reporter said he was committed to reporting on every document of public interest that Edward Snowden had given him, but he said he did consider the potential harm publication could cause and consulted with experienced editors in reporters in deciding what to publish. He also pointed out that they discussed stories with the governments affected, \"but he acknowledged they usually disregard\" those governments' views, the Associated Press reported. \"I don't think anyone could say we have not been thoughtful enough,\" Greenwald said. Greenwald also said there was a \"sustained attack\" on press freedom in the US, and criticised the UK government for asking the Guardian to destroy computers containing material leaked by Snowden. He called on journalists everywhere to work together to defend their rights. \"The more we band together, the harder it will be for states to attack press freedoms,\" he said. Glenn Greenwald speaks via teleconference from Rio at the 69th General Assembly of the Inter-American Press Association on 21 October 2013.

From 4.30-5pm today MPs will debate “the Guardian newspaper and its impact on national security”, a topic put forward by Tory MP Julian Smith. Smith has written to the Metropolitan police asking the force to investigate whether the Guardian had broken the law by communicating intelligence information obtained from Edward Snowden. The MP asked if offences had been committed under Section 58A of the Terrorism Act 2000 or the Official Secrets Act. A Guardian spokesman has said: The high public interest in the stories we have responsibly published is evidenced by the debates, presidential review and proposed legislative reforms in the US Congress, throughout Europe and in Westminster. We're surprised that, once again, it is being proposed that terror legislation should be used against journalists. Smith also said in the Commons that the Guardian should be prosecuted if it did not hand over a decryption key to files seized from David Miranda, the partner of journalist Glenn Greenwald. In response to that, Greenwald said: “Strange UK wants the encryption key to access David Miranda's docs since it claimed (falsely) he carried it with him.” I’ll be live-blogging the debate here, and you should also be able to watch it live on this site. In other news, Barack Obama phoned his French counterpart Francois Hollande last night in an attempt to limit the damage from mounting anger in Paris over claims that the NSA engaged in widespread phone and internet surveillance of French citizens. The White House conceded that revelations about how its intelligence agencies intercepted enormous amounts of French phone traffic raised “legitimate questions for our friends and allies”. MEPs in the European parliament have overwhelmingly backed draft rules on data privacy in the first concrete EU response to the revelations of mass digital surveillance by the Americans and the British. The new regime would curb the transfer of personal data to US corporations. Ian Traynor in Brussels writes In a vote on Monday evening, MEPs in the parliament's civil liberties and justice committee supported the draft new regime, which will form a framework for further negotiations with the 28 governments of the EU. The legislation has been gridlocked for almost two years following US pressure to dilute the package. Disclosures by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden about mass digital surveillance in Europe by the Americans and the British have changed the climate on data privacy, lending greater urgency to the attempt to frame new rules in the EU. Here Julian Borger, the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, looks at the reaction to the Snowden revelations in Europe, Turkey, Russia, Brazil and Mexico. We'll have all this and more here throughout the day. Updated at 11.47am BST 6.39pm BST Germany German telecommunications providers are increasing efforts to profit from the reputation damage to their US counterparts in the wake of the NSA scandal by planning an email service secure from foreign snooping, writes Philip Oltermann in Berlin. In August, a grouping of larger companies – including state-owned Deutsche Telekom, GMX and web.de – had started a marketing campaign called Email Made in Germany, which contrasted the \"insecure\" reputation of US companies with that of providers based in Germany – famed for its strict data security laws. Now Deutsche Telekom has put forward new plans for a national internet network, where emails between German users would no longer have to go via foreign servers. Thomas Kremer, Telekom's management board member responsible for data privacy, legal affairs and compliance, tells the Guardian that his company has \"recommended internet traffic be kept within Schengen countries where possible. A basis for this solution would be a 'national routing' just like in the US. Intelligence services of countries outside this area would then find it much more difficult to access this data traffic.\" That's it from me for today. I'll be back tomorrow, when MPs will debate “the Guardian newspaper and its impact on national security”, a topic put forward by Tory MP Julian Smith. Join me then. 4.32pm BST Feinstein The NSA's mass collection of phone records is \"not surveillance\" and should be maintained as an essential tool to combat terrorism, the chair of the US Senate select committee on intelligence has said. In an article for USA Today, Dianne Feinstein wrote that the NSA's work had been \"effective in helping to prevent terrorist plots against the US and our allies\". My colleague Paul Lewis has the full story here. He writes: Feinstein, a Democrat from California, is introducing legislation that would make superficial alterations to the NSA and the secret courts that are supposed to provide judicial oversight. But her bill stops short of making any substantial changes to the way the agency conducts its work, despite the string of revelations based on disclosures by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. A host of rival bills being introduced in Washington go much further, including one from Democratic senator Patrick Leahy, who chairs the Senate judiciary committee. Leahy is proposing an end to the bulk collection of phone records, which is authorised under an interpretation of section 215 of the Patriot Act. Leahy's bill, which is viewed as the main rival to Feinstein's, will be introduced simultaneously in the House by Republican Jim Sensenbrenner, the author of the Patriot Act. He has said the law was never intended for this kind of data collection, a program he now intends to put \"out of business\". Senior intelligence officials are lobbying hard on Capitol Hill to protect the program, and Feinstein has been one of their strongest supporters in Congress. In her op-ed, Feinstein repeated the testimony of NSA and other intelligence leaders, which many critics argue has been misleading. In her article, Feinstein writes: The call-records program is not surveillance. It does not collect the content of any communication, nor do the records include names or locations. The NSA only collects the type of information found on a telephone bill: phone numbers of calls placed and received, the time of the calls and duration ... To be effective, the NSA must be able to conduct these queries quickly, without regard to which phone carrier a terrorist or conspirator uses. And the records must be available for a few years – longer than phone companies need them for billing purposes. The director of the NSA, Keith Alexander, has said there were \"one or possibly two\" cases of terrorist activity that would not have been prevented \"but for\" section 215 of the Patriot Act. 3.42pm BST The NSA files: the video Here's a video explaining why the NSA revelations should matter to you. 3.39pm BST France Here is a clip of the French foreign minister, Larent Fabius, discussing calling in the US ambassador. 3.12pm BST Pierre Omidyar The New York Times has interviewed Pierre Omidyar, the eBay founder who is providing $150m of funding for a new news site created with outgoing Guardian NSA reporter Glenn Greenwald. Omidyar was asked what was behind his interest in secrecy and transparency. He said: A number of things happened: even before the Snowden leaks, we saw a number of what I would characterise as missteps by the Justice Department. We saw the Justice Department wiretap the AP newsroom. We saw [Fox News reporter James] Rosen being labeled as co-conspirator label in affidavits; we see the many leak prosecutions including the use of the Espionage Act. It alerted me to the fact that even in this great country of ours with this fantastic Constitution, there’s a real pressure against press freedoms that’s going on. Perhaps unintentionally in the hot pursuit of leakers and trying to protect secrets, we are really putting pressure on press freedom here. When you have mass surveillance, it’s impossible to meet the intent of the First Amendment because reporters can’t talk to sources because sources are afraid to talk. He explained a bit about what he could bring to online journalism: Technologists understand our users and break down how user engagement increases from somebody that maybe just tries your product once and then goes away, to a different kind of person that progressively gets more and more engaged and then becomes just totally locked into your product. That’s something people in Silicon Valley spend a ton of time analysing, working on and thinking about. Pierre Omidyar Photograph: guardian.co.uk 11.33am BST My colleague Michael White backs Chris Huhne's decision to ask which Labour cabinet ministers signed off GCHQ's Tempora programme. He writes: How much did the security apparatus, GCHQ, MI5 and MI6, tell David Cameron – and before him all PMs as far back as John Major – about the new surveillance technologies which effortlessly outstripped all capacity to place them under legal control and constraint? And who signed off on whatever it was they were told? It's not that what they did was criminal; there were probably good reasons at the time. Good reasons too why the Brown or Blair cabinet was not informed ... The dangers of a leak from an inexperienced cabinet in 2010, full of tension and Lib Dems, is obvious. You can see why they didn't do it, rightly or not. But now that it's out – most things come out in the end - we need to know who knew what so that the routine claims since Snowden broke cover that Tempora and its kind are properly accountable can be exposed for the self-serving deceits they probably are. Updated at 12.44pm BST 11.15am BST The US ambassador to France, Charles Rivkin, has declined to comment on reports that he had been called in by the French foreign minister, but he told Reuters in Paris: \"This relationship on a military, intelligence, special forces ... level is the best it's been in a generation.\" 11.07am BST In an English-language piece, Martin Untersinger of Le Monde says his paper “has now also had access to these [Snowden’s] documents”. He writes: The Snowden documents have breached the world of western secrecy which demonstrates the considerable efforts implemented by the United States to eavesdrop on the Internet – the place where the majority of world communications have now moved to, in a legal framework which is sometimes vague and, in most cases, quite remote from real democratic discussion. Questioned by Le Monde, the American authorities assured us that the Prism programme had been debated in parliament in the United States and that it functioned in a strictly regulated legal framework. Questioned on 12 September, about the revelations of the ex-consultant, James Clapper, national head of American intelligence, replied that for his part: 'I hate to have to recognize it but what has happened – and what is harmful – has led to conversation and a debate which were in fact probably necessary'. 10.05am BST My colleague Sam Jones has been reading Le Monde's articles. He writes that between 10 December 2012 and 8 January 2013, the NSA recorded 70.3m phone calls in France. According to the paper, the documents show that the NSA was allegedly targeting not only terrorist suspects but also politicians, businesspeople and members of the administration under a programme codenamed US-985D. \"The agency has several collection methods,\" says Le Monde. \"When certain French phone numbers are dialled, a signal is activated that triggers the automatic recording of certain conversations. This surveillance also recovers SMS and content based on keywords.\" Such methods, it added, allowed the NSA to keep a systematic record of each target's connections. Le Monde said US authorities had declined to comment on the documents, which they regard as classified material. Sam adds that the French interior minister, Manuel Valls, described the revelations as shocking, and said he would be pressing for detailed explanations from Washington. Valls said: Rules are obviously needed when it comes to new communication technologies, and that's something that concerns every country. If a friendly country – an ally – spies on France or other European countries, that is completely unacceptable. 9.49am BST The NSA \"swept up\" 70.3m French phone records over 30 days, the Associated Press reports, citing Le Monde. Monday's Le Monde report was co-written by Glenn Greenwald, the outgoing Guardian journalist who wrote many of this paper's biggest stories based on Snowden's leaks. Le Monde wrote that when certain numbers were used, conversations were automatically recorded. The surveillance operation also \"swept up\" text messages based on key words, the French paper reported, based on records from 10 December to 8 January 2013. Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, said he would demand an explanation for the practice, which he called \"totally unacceptable\". Updated at 10.02am BST 9.40am BST France France has called in its US ambassador to protest at the allegations in Le Monde about large-scale spying on French citizens by the US National Security Agency, the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, has said. At an EU foreign ministers' meeting in Luxembourg this morning, Fabius told reports: I have immediately summoned the US ambassador and he will be received this morning at the Quai d'Orsay [the French foreign ministry]. 9.08am BST Monday 21 October 2013 Welcome to our hub for all Edward Snowden, NSA and GCHQ-related developments around the world, as controversy over revelations leaked by the whistleblower continue to make headlines. As arguments rage over how much of our day to day life should be monitored in the name of security, we'll be tracking the growing global debate about privacy in the digital age. We'd like to know what you think about the whole NSA story, what you're worried about – and any new areas you'd like to read more about. Good morning and welcome to this week’s NSA live blog, with live coverage of all major developments resulting from Edward Snowden’s leak of information about US and UK surveillance to the Guardian. Le Monde has today published details from files leaked by Snowden, and we’ll have more details on their stories shortly. Here are today’s headlines: • The former cabinet minister Chris Huhne has called for an investigation into which Labour cabinet ministers signed off GCHQ's Tempora programme, the clandestine electronic surveillance programme revealed by leaks from the former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden. Huhne, the Liberal Democrat who resigned from parliament after being jailed over lying about a speeding offence, has revealed the cabinet was not informed about Tempora, which was tested in 2008 and fully implemented in 2011. Writing in the Guardian, the former member of the coalition's national security council asks whether the Labour cabinet was similarly kept in the dark and suggests the decision to authorise the programme could yet be made subject to judicial review. You can read Huhne’s full Guardian article here. • With some Conservative MPs planning in a parliamentary debate tomorrow to make the case for the prosecution of the Guardian over the Snowden disclosures, the US ambassador to Britain, Matthew Barzun, rejected an opportunity to criticise the newspaper on Sunday, saying he wanted to focus on the importance of the debate about the tradeoffs between security and privacy. Barzun was appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show for the first time since his arrival in London in June, and talked about the impact of the debate on national security created by Snowden's leaks. He also stressed that President Barack Obama was clear that his response to the leaks should not have \"a chilling effect on the press\". Asked if he shared the UK security services' concerns about the threat to national security from the leaks, he said he wanted to focus on the \"importance of having this debate about what the trade-offs are between security and privacy, between transparency and secrecy, and to do so in a way that protects whistleblowers – which is different, by the way, from wholesale releasing of information, hundreds of thousands of documents\". Barzun said Obama had \"promised to seek to balance the legitimate security concerns of not only our citizens but of our allies, and balance those with the privacy concerns shared by all people\". He said the president \"put in specific measures to protect whistleblowers if they see something illegal or unethical. That's an important part of the balance\". • Harold Evans, the former editor of the Sunday Times and the Times, has come to the defence of the Guardian for its reporting of the Snowden leaks. \"No editor in his right mind wants to give aid to murderous enemies,\" he writes, \"but every editor is duty bound to scrutinise the use of power, responsibly but fearlessly, however personally unappealing a leaker may be. Conflict between the conceptions of duty is inevitable, indeed healthy. Reporting often exposes an ill that government has not recognised or acknowledged.\" • Mexico has criticised the United States over new allegations of spying after a German magazine reported that the US National Security Agency (NSA) had hacked Felipe Calderon's public email account while he was president. Der Spiegel said in May 2010, an NSA division known as \"Tailored Access Operations\" reported it had gained access to then-president Calderon's email account, and turned his office into a \"lucrative\" source of information. It said details of the alleged NSA hacking of Calderon's account were contained in a document leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Snowden's leaked information has prompted angry recriminations against Washington in Latin America, particularly Brazil. You can read last week’s live blog here. We'll have full coverage of all the fallout from the revelations here throughout the week.

Residents of the area where Ashley Cole has rented out an LA holiday mansion for the summer have complained about the state of his rubbish bins, which are overflowing with pizza cartons and KFC wrappers and spilling garbage onto the sidewalk (as it's known there). One horrified neighbour told the Sun: \"It stinks. It's disgusting.\" The waste receptacles are thus vying with a certain Qatari football administrator for the title of football's most unpopular Bin. One guest at the non-stop Cole house party, Manchester chauffeur boss Curtis Codrington, revealed intimate details of the scene inside the mansion when he tweeted: \"Bottles till u drop LA wooo.\" Meanwhile neighbours of the west London residential mansion which Frank Lampard is busy extending despite local protests have complained about the state of his building works. One neighbour told the Sun: \"No one is happy about it. It just seems insensitive. It's going to be months of noise.\" Months of noise: it's the transfer window in a nutshell. Back to Portugal, then, where the Porto president Jorge Pinto da Costa has warned new Chelsea manager, André Villas-Boas, that he'll have to spend big money to get the team's stars to follow him to London. And to prove he's not kidding he slapped a £62m combined price tag on the striker Falcao and the playmaker João Moutinho. But Chelsea could make all of that and more by dumping Lampard, Didier Drogba, Nicolas Anelka, Florent Malouda, Michael Essien, Salomon Kalou and Mikel John Obi. Perhaps they already have been dumped — it would help to explain why Ashley Cole's bins are so full. Carlos Tevez's £150,000-a-week salary has scared off potential suitors Internazionale. \"He is a great player, but his salary means it is out of the question,\" said the sporting director, Marco Branca. Equally unlikely to move to Italy is Gaël Clichy, who has informed Arsenal that he would prefer to replace Wolves-bound-and-anyway-rubbish Paul Konchesky at Liverpool rather than move to rival bidders Roma — even though the Italians' bid is, at £7m, a full £2m more than Liverpool's. Manchester City are also seeking a left-back, but after mulling over an offer for Leighton Baines they have made Lyon's £20m-rated Aly Cissokho their top target. Roma are engaged in another battle with the English, vying with Blackburn for the German-American midfielder Jermaine Jones. Schalke's £5.5m-rated ace spent the end of last season on loan at Ewood Park but might consider Rome a more interesting destination than Lancashire for cultural reasons. As the Mill sees it, it's a tough choice — one has several ancient monuments including the Spanish Steps; the other has several ancient monuments including the Spanish full-back Míchel Salgado. Talking of full-backs, though, Blackburn want the Russia right-back Alexander Anyukov and have £4m to prove it. Steve Bruce plans to splash the first £4m of the Jordan Henderson cash on Wes Brown, though Aston Villa and Everton might join the bidding for the former England star. Liverpool have matched Sunderland's £8m offer for Ipswich's 18-year-old hotshot Connor Wickham, and the teams might also battle it out for Wigan's Charles N'Zogbia after Kenny Dalglish was appalled by Aston Villa's £19m valuation of first choice left-wing target Stewart Downing. The new man at the Villa helm, Alex McLeish, wants to scoop Germinal Beerschot midfielder Victor Wanyama from under the noses of Swansea and Celtic. Martin Jol's rebuilding work at Fulham will begin with the signing of Espanyol's 27-year-old goalkeeper Carlos Kameni. \"The Premier League is a fantastic league and very competitive for keepers,\" trilled the Cameroon ace. West Bromwich want Real Mallorca's £2.5m Cameroon striker Pierre Webó, and are considering offloading Gabriel Tamas to Lazio on a season-long loan. And Tottenham's hunt for a goalscorer could lead them to Diego Forlán, who is available at a knock-down £7m because he's 32 and Atlético Madrid don't really want him any more. The Uruguayan has already rejected a move to Galatasaray and Atlético president, Enrique Cerezo, subtly suggested that his first choice might be a move to England: \"It looks like his first choice will be England.\" Non-football news now, and 33,000 Texas Rangers baseball fans have broken a world record by simultaneously wearing sunglasses in the dark. George W Bush was one of them. And here's a philosophical question for readers of the Mill to mull: is there a level of fame and fortune beyond which the idea of a wedding gift list becomes less a little bit irritating and more just totally obnoxious? Millionaire supermodel Kate Moss is bravely attempting to find us an answer, by preparing a list for her forthcoming nuptials that includes 14 crystal ashtrays at a total cost of £3,360, plus a £35 rabbit-shaped jelly mould.","Id":"football/2011/jun/23/football-transfer-rumours-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: £62m duo Falcao and Moutinho to Chelsea?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jun/23/football-transfer-rumours-chelsea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2011/jun/23/football-transfer-rumours-chelsea","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport","wordcount":815,"webPublicationDate":"2011-06-23T08:22:01Z","id":"football/2011/jun/23/football-transfer-rumours-chelsea","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Ask Tom - your travel dilemmas answered","body":"I want to give my 16-year-old daughter a fantastic holiday in Europe next summer as we've had a really tough year; two interesting weeks, not too packaged, no car rental, moderate budget. As a single mum safety is important too. Elaine You might find a small group adventure tour to your liking. Several companies do these very well, and get you to places that you would otherwise have found tough to reach without hiring a car. Intrepid Travel's (intrepidtravel.com) 15-day Baltic Explorer (from £1,485pp excluding meals) travels from Helsinki in Finland to Berlin exploring the cities and natural scenery in between – you pass through Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. If you'd rather do your own thing, I'd suggest a combination of two or three cities, possibly linked by rail, with the scope for excursions. Your daughter qualifies for cheaper rail fares, making four days of rail travel in Italy within a month £63 for her and £126 for you. It'll be hot, but I'd imagine you'd both love the adventure of taking the train between cities and the combination of art, shopping, gelato and pizza. Just within Italy there's a huge choice but Rome to Venice via Florence – and Pisa if you wish – or Bologna is a marvellous linear journey easily done without a car. You could take the train there and back via Paris if you wanted (see raileurope.co.uk for details and fares) or take a budget flight. If your daughter has a longer holiday than usual this year, then go earlier for the best prices and fewest crowds, the latter being the main downside of Italy at this time. Readers' suggestions are welcome. My girlfriend and I want to go to Iran in April, flying from Tehran to the southern city of Shiraz to start our journey back to Tehran as suggested in the Lonely Planet, but it doesn't seem possible to book the internal flight. The only flight options we are offered are Tehran to Shiraz via Dubai, which seems ridiculous. How can we book internal flights in Iran? Matthew Morris It may be that you're a little early. Iran Air (iranair.co.uk) has online booking on internal flights, but when I tried to book a date in early April I was routed via Kuwait. Aha, I thought, I was asking to travel via Imam Khomeini International, the main international hub, rather than the older Mehrabad terminal, which handles the bulk of domestic traffic, but the results were still unsatisfying. When I looked to go from Mehrabad to Shiraz in December however, I was offered a selection of direct flights, bookable online and costing £48 one way, including taxes. I have asked Iran Air when its April flights will be bookable and will post a comment below when I hear back. In the meantime, you can concentrate on the slightly trickier business of securing an Iranian visa. I'd love to know how you get on with all of this – do post back here if and when you have success. I am heading to Morocco next Easter with my young family (adventurous boys plus intrepid wife). Thought it would be interesting to enter from the Spanish mainland, ie fly to Malaga and catch boat to Tangier. Is this a good idea and where would you stay for your first night in Tangier? Any advice about trains to let us go deeper into the country and see places like Marrakech would be welcome. Mike Tait The busiest sea crossing between Spain and Morocco runs between Algeciras and Tangier and is the best and most exciting way to arrive. There are also fast boats from Tarifa to Tangier. If you really like ferries, you can make your way from Sête in France and Genoa in Italy but these are much slower services. Direct Ferries (directferries.co.uk) has information and links on ferries across Europe. Although there are lots of crossings between Algeciras and Tangier, you will find ferries busy, especially at the end of Easter week, so advance booking is a good idea. Once in Tangier, there are plenty of budget options around the port gate and medina, but you may find yourself feeling swamped by touts. The budget options in the Ville Nouvelle are often better so consider hopping in a cab there. Hotel El-Munira (no website, doubles £15-20) on Rue Magellan is a good bolthole and was where William Burroughs wrote the Naked Lunch. If you find it full, there's plenty more choice nearby. To get from Tangier to Marrakech you can take an overnight train, or a day service changing at Rabat – see oncf.ma for times. There are also bus connections which can be quicker but are not as sociable. We're travelling from Manchester to Mongolia next July for the third time, to visit our daughter and granddaughters who live there. The best option seems to be flights with Air China, with only a one-hour stopover in Beijing. Do you think this will be long enough? We are not sure whether we would have to change terminals in which case one hour does not seem long. The alternative is to go via Heathrow and Moscow with Aeroflot. We travelled with Aeroflot the first time we went and survived but do not want to be stuck in Sheremetyevo airport for any longer than necessary! The stopover time on the return flight is only 50 mins – this would be great if there were no delays. What do you think? Lynn Barrett Round the World Flights (roundtheworldflights.com) suggests that 60 minutes is the minimum travelling time through Sheremetyevo and would recommend two to threee hours for the change you're undertaking in Beijing. Even this sounds like a bit of a squeeze and could make for some stressful incoming flights. To see alternatives you may find it useful to have a look at the recently revamped ITA Trip Planner software, which is freely available at http://matrix.itasoftware.com/cvg/ – login as a guest. They also have a mean, free iPhone application. Both can search for flight itineraries and give you a useful steer on available options and indicative prices. I sympathise when it comes to Sheremetyevo but one route through here appears a better option than the next best route through Beijing, which appears to involve day-long layovers in each direction. A combination of KLM and Aeroflot via Amsterdam requires five hours at Schiphol and two in Moscow, so you may decide this is a better bet. Departures in July travelling this route should cost around £1,020 depending on who you book with and when.","Id":"travel/blog/2010/nov/03/ask-tom-holiday-advice","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webTitle":"Ask Tom - your travel dilemmas answered","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2010/nov/03/ask-tom-holiday-advice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/blog/2010/nov/03/ask-tom-holiday-advice","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":1085,"webPublicationDate":"2010-11-03T13:26:49Z","id":"travel/blog/2010/nov/03/ask-tom-holiday-advice","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"At last - the cookery class for junk food addicts","body":"A break-up is never easy, but when your boyfriend is a chef there's another, more immediate problem: who's going to do the cooking now? I've been on my share of cookery courses over the years but, although I've enjoyed the classes, I have never been inspired to make any of the dishes back home: too complicated, too \"cheffy\". I love food, but not cooking. One of the advantages of dating a chef ... After the post-split period of appetite loss and disconsolate picking at your food, the comfort eating kicks in. So when I heard about an ice cream and pizza-making course in Italy (learn to cook junk food - how fabulous is that?) I ditched the tissues, licked my lips and booked a flight to Naples. Of course, in Italy ice cream and pizza aren't junk food. The Italians use only the freshest ingredients and make everything from scratch - no soggy pizza bases from the supermarket deep-freeze. This was going to be the perfect combination: quick-fix food that was also healthy and delicious. Even the name of the cookery school, Mami Camilla, sounded comforting: like a big welcoming hug from a chubby-armed Italian mamma. Camilla is, indeed, an Italian mamma and wife to Biagio Longo, a giant teddy bear of a chef who has worked all over the world - Belgium, England, South America, the US - and had his own restaurants in Naples and Sorrento. Mami Camilla is a family business and the four children, Agostino, Giuseppe, Odilia and Laura, all squabble, laugh and work together. The cookery school and rambling B&B is in the old family home in Sorrento, a hair-raising hour down the coast from Naples, unless Luigi, Laura's sensible, young engineer-student boyfriend - and my taxi driver for the day - is driving. Everyone gets roped in. The sprawling white-washed building surrounded by lemon trees laden with fruit was once an olive oil factory. In the whitewashed, barrel-vaulted kitchen, festooned with copper pots, you can still see the clay pipes coming out of the ceiling. The olives were crushed in the room above and the oil drizzled down into huge barrels. Pulling up outside the green gates, I could hear laughter drifting from the garden. Family, boyfriends, girlfriends, friends, children and general hangers-on, were sitting around a huge wooden table tucking into a rowdy Sunday lunch. \"Are you hungry?\" Agostino asked as we clattered up the old stone steps to my room. Is the pope Catholic? The two-day ice-cream and pizza course is just one of a number of options offered here which range from one-day Italian cookery tasters (popular with Sorrento's posh hotel crowd) to three-month internships where students study at the school and then work for a month or so at a restaurant in town. The people you meet at breakfast might be students from US cordon bleu schools, backpackers staying at the B&B or fellow cookery mini-breakers. The next morning we started with pizza. Normally there would be up to nine students in the class, but I lucked out the week I was there and had Biagio to myself. He dumped a kilo of flour (plus yeast, salt and sugar) on the marble-topped island in the middle of the kitchen and made a hole in the centre with his huge fist. \"The pizza in Naples is the best in the world. It's made with a sourdough starter, rather than with yeast, so it's lighter on the stomach. However, you have to cook it in a wood-fired oven at around 500C.\" If you don't happen to have a huge brick oven in your garden it is still possible to make good pizza in a conventional oven, using yeast, and Biagio was going to show us how. He poured water into the hole he had made in the heap of flour and started mixing it all together. I measured out my ingredients and did the same. As the water soaked up the flour mixture we began kneading, pummelling and slapping the dough around. It was better than therapy. \"Now we leave it for half an hour to rise. Come.\" Time for a quick cappuccino in the sun. I was starting to think that I was on a crash course in the art of Italian living rather than at a cookery school. I sipped a creamy coffee, listening to the hum of scooters and the twittering of birds in the lemon trees, while Spike, the family dog, lay spread-eagled at my feet. Half an hour later the dough had risen into a springy dome, Biagio had taken an SOS call from his pregnant daughter, Odilia, who had broken down on the autopista to Rome, and Agostino, the 36-year-old Italian stallion, had taken over the pizza class. Life's a bitch. Dividing the dough into sections we rolled mini pizza balls, then flattened them on the marble worktop before pulling them into shape with our fingers. For the larger pizzas we threw the dough from one hand to the other, stretching it out. The topping, whole canned tomatoes in a bowl with salt, pepper and a sprinkling of sugar, we squelched together with our fingers. It was satisfying in a sensual, childlike, deeply mucky way. Smoothing it onto the pizza bases we added mozzarella, capers, olives, peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, anchovies. While the pizzas were cooking Agostino taught me to make a southern Italian speciality, casatiello. Smearing a large pizza base with olive oil, we sprinkled on mozzarella, chopped salami and Parma ham. We rolled the pizza into a sausage, curled it round a tin and shoved it in the oven. \"They deep-fry the pizza in Scotland,\" I told Agostino, wiping my hands. \"They used to deep-fry the base in Italy,\" he replied. \"You can see it in a film classic set in Sorrento in the 50s, with Sophia Loren. 'Pane, Amore e ... ' [Bread, Love and ...] .\" Says it all. Somehow Sophia Loren frying pizza in Italy seems OK in a way that the Glaswegian version doesn't. Agostino pulled the sizzling pizzas out of the oven and called his family to the table for lunch. A carafe of wine, an avocado salad quickly rustled up and we tucked into the best pizza in the world. Sorry Naples. Day 2: gelato. \"Ice-cream,\" Biagio had told me, \"was invented by the Arabs in Sicily. It's simple - milk, sugar and eggs plus whatever flavour you want to add to the mix.\" Biagio's mother was a pastry chef who owned a little bar and bought her first ice-cream machine in 1948. Even the cheapest machine in Italy costs around €3,000, he told me. So although we would be making ice-cream, Agostino would also teach me how to make a semi-freddo or half-frozen dessert which anyone can make at home without any expensive equipment. But first, gelato. I stirred the milk, egg and sugar mixture on the stove until it was just about to boil. Then we left it to cool. The flavouring, a rich pistachio paste, was added next and then the mixture was tipped into the ice-cream machine. Eight minutes later, gelato was oozing out in soft, creamy waves. We also made vanilla ice-cream. And strawberry with fruit straight from the market. Three thousand euros suddenly seemed a sensible investment. But we still had to make the semi-freddo. Whip equal amounts of egg white and sugar until stiff. Then whip up a bowl of cream, and stir sugar in a copper pan on the stove until it caramelises. Add hazelnuts to the caramel and pour the molten mixture on to the marble surface to cool (make sure you put oil on the surface to stop it sticking). Blend the cooled caramelised nuts. Mix together the whipped cream, egg whites, crushed nuts and a spoonful of toffee, spoon into pots and stick in the freezer for a few hours. Lick the bowl. \"So where can you find the best ice-cream in Sorrento?\" I asked the Italian stallion. \"Gelateria Davide. I'll take you there later on my scooter.\" As break-up remedies go it doesn't get much better than that.

Modern visitors have more often been finished off by the heat, the cars and the filth. I have spent a decade working on the nearby ancient city of Pompeii and during that time I have found much to love about Naples - and discovered some of its hidden pleasures. 1. Favourite place to stay Constantinopoli hotel, Naples, Italy Photograph: PR Photograph: PR For years I shelled out ridiculous amounts of money for a noisy Vesuvius view in a sea-front hotel, or suffered in sweaty, seedy B&Bs. Then I discovered this wonderful place in the old city: five minutes' walk from the Archaeological Museum, at the back of a typical Neapolitan courtyard -(where you'll find a carpenter's shop and assemblage of dying cars), boasting a tiny luscious garden, swimming pool and elegant 19th-century villa atmosphere. It's small (only 20 rooms and suites) and not cheap, especially with a plummeting pound. But worth it, for the good night's sleep alone. • Costantinopoli 104 (Via S Maria di Costantinopoli, 104). Double room and good breakfast starts at €220. 2. Favourite restaurant Ristorante Bellini serves tasty old-fashioned Neapolitan cooking at old-fashioned prices (a good meal for €30 a head). It's been going since the 1940s and some of the waiters seem to go back almost that far. They serve pizza, but I'd opt for the fish and the pasta. For a perfect blow-out, try the 'linguine al cartoccio' – a medley of seafood and pasta, cooked and served in what can only be described as a large paper bag. • Ristorante Bellini, Via S Maria di Constantinopoli, 79-80. Closed Sundays. 3. Favourite pizzeria Pizza is the cheapest food option in Naples, and especially useful for filling up children for little more than a fiver. Lombardi has been in this spot since 1892. It's a sprawling place with (air-conditioned) rooms upstairs and down. The pizzas are the Real Thing. • Pizzeria Lombardi a S. Chiara, Via B Croce 59 (don't confuse it with the Pizzeria Lombardi in Via Foria). 4. Favourite museum Don't expect much in the way of visitor services here at the National Archaeological Museum. There is a book shop and a rudimentary café, but that's about all. You will find many galleries closed off and most of the labels unhelpful. Doesn't sound promising? No – but the objects themselves are stunning. The most impressive Roman finds from Pompeii are here. Look out for the paintings and mosaics that decorated the ancient houses (kids will like the \"Cave Canem\" - \"Beware of the dog\" – mosaic). Stop also in the rooms that house all the bronze finds. Most people walk quickly through the rows and rows of cases. But if you take a look, you'll spot all the bric-a-brac of Roman life: from keys, to cooking utensils and tweezers. • National Archaeological Museum (Piazza Museo, 19, +39 (0)81 440166; open all day, closed Tuesday). EU citizens under 18 and over 65 get in free, but take a passport to claim this. 5. Favourite painting Caravaggio's The Seven Works of Mercy is tucked away in the headquarters of a 17th-century charitable foundation, Il Pio Monte della Misericordia (Via dei Tribunali, 253), where it forms the altar piece of the chapel. Painted in 1607, when Caravaggio was on the run from a murder charge in Rome, it depicts all kinds of iconic acts of generosity, ancient and medieval (I like the woman breast-feeding her own father in prison). The chapel and formal rooms of the Pio Monte are open most mornings. The best view of the painting is from the upstairs rooms overlooking the chapel. You can make a virtual visit at piomontedellamisericordia.it 6. Favourite excavation The archaeological site underneath the Cathedral of Naples is one of the most surprising remains of antiquity anywhere in the world. For a few euros you can climb down into large tracts of the ancient city of Neapolis. It is an intriguing underground world, where you go down through the Roman buildings to the fifth century BC Greek city. There are more antiquities to explore underground at the nearby Church of San Lorenzo Maggiore (Piazzetta S Gaetano). • Cathedral of Naples, Via Duomo, 149. Open most days, but closed between 12.30 and 4.30pm. 7. Favourite catacombs Photograph: Mimmo Jodice/Corbis Photograph: Mimmo Jodice/Corbis The catacombs of San Gennaro are much more impressive than anything you can see in Rome itself. These early Christian burial grounds go back to the second century AD, but were still in use centuries later – becoming the resting place of the city's patron, San Gennaro. Go to see the extraordinary early Christian paintings, still visible on the walls. Parties are usually taken around in the mornings, but details change. Check it out first with the Tourist Information or by phoning +39 (0)81 7411071 • Via Capodimonte, 16; enter next to the Church of the Madre del Buon Consiglio 8. Favourite trip out Photograph: Roy Rainford/Robert Harding World Imagery/Corbis Photograph: Roy Rainford/Robert Harding World Imagery/Corbis Pompeii, the city buried in 79AD is the queen of archaeological sites, and big enough to hold the millions of visitors it attracts. Allow at least half a day to get the feel of the place. Resist the tourist guides, get a map and a guidebook – and be independent. Part of the fun is finding a quiet spot and just wandering down an empty Roman street. Otherwise the high-spots include the Villa of the Mysteries (for stupendous painting) and the newly restored brothel (for the seedier side of ancient life). • To reach Pompeii take a Circumvesuviana train from the central station to Pompei Scavi - Villa dei Misteri. The site is open every day, for €11 (with the same concessions as the Archaeological Museum). pompeiisites.org/, +39 (0)81 8575111. 9: Favourite bar Station bar, Pompei Scavi. My own enthusiasm for bars depends on my need for a rest and a drink. A day in the ruins makes me beg for a campari soda. The entrance to the site is generally crowded with pushy salesmen and bad bargains. The only thing you should buy from them, on the way in, is a bottle of water. What is special about the bar at Pompei station is that it is so ordinary and reasonably priced. On your way out, wait for your train with your glass in hand. 10. Favourite miracle The blood of San Gennaro. If you are in Naples on 19 September, 16 December or the Saturday before the first Sunday in May, go to the cathedral and get a glimpse of the famous miracle: the dried blood of the patron saint, stored in a little flask, is supposed to liquefy in front of the waiting crowd. Is it true? How is it done? Go and see for yourself. • Mary Beard is professor of classics at Cambridge University and author of Pompeii: The Life of a Roman Town published by Profile Books.

Chunks of masonry fell from other damaged buildings, including parts of the basilica, and the tremor - measured by the US Geological Survey at magnitude 5.6 - was felt as far away as Rome. Within minutes the city resounded again to the scream of sirens as police and rescue workers rushed to the scene. Meanwhile, rescue workers were preparing to carry out what one called a \"surgical operation\" on a collapsed building in the centre of L'Aquila in the hope of saving the lives of four missing students as the overall death toll reached at least 235. Sergio Basti, the Rome fire brigade engineer leading the attempt, said his team aimed to demolish the residence where the students were trapped \"bit by bit from the top, like scraping toppings from a pizza\". The students' residence has been a focus of the rescue operation since early on Monday, shortly after the earthquake that devastated the city and several of the surrounding towns and villages. The operation was decided on after rescue workers fixed the location of the four students inside the shattered building. But Basti warned: \"We do not know whether they are dead or alive.\" He said relatives of the four young people who were sleeping in the residence when the earthquake struck had been briefed on what was going to happen. The relatives had spent much of the day waiting anxiously, and sometimes tearfully, outside the building among reporters, police and firefighters. Two of the missing were brought out alive from the residence early on Tuesday. Yesterday morning, a third student was found dead. It was the prelude to a day in which the death toll in and around L'Aquila surged higher and the balance shifted perceptibly away from the hope of finding more survivors and towards a more exigent calculation of the risks facing the rescuers. Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, told a press conference in L'Aquila that the search for the living would go on for another 48 hours. But it was clear that in some places the chances of finding survivors alive had already been written off. Next to the Piazzale Paoli park where a block of flats had collapsed outwards under the force of the shockwaves, an earth mover was vigorously gouging through the rubble in a way that suggested the rescuers no longer feared disturbing survivors. The \"surgical operation\" at the students' residence was decided on after the fourth aftershock since midnight threatened to bring it crashing down. A rescue worker was attached to a crane and lifted above the four-storey building to make an inspection. Afterwards, a member of the team said the residence had been further weakened by the aftershocks and was being kept up by just one of its concrete pillars. Even before they struck, huge concrete slabs that had once been floors were hanging menacingly over the rubble below in which the rescuers were searching. What chances remained of discovering survivors depended on increasingly delicate probing. A few hundred metres from the students' residence, on the other side of a severely cracked bridge, four Spanish rescue workers were taking a break after working through the night. None of them had slept since the previous morning. They had just emerged from a nearby house after penetrating to the basement. \"We are waiting for a special instrument that can pick up vibrations,\" said Angelina Molina of the Málaga-based voluntary group GEA, as she took a long drag on her cigarette. \"It can pick up even the slightest vibration, even that caused by someone scratching his or her nail on a wall,\" added her colleague Gabriel Leo. The periodic wail of sirens and occasional clatter of a helicopter notwithstanding, L'Aquila was like a ghost town yesterday. Berlusconi said: \"Other tremors are possible and the message to the population is not to go back home.\" By then, however, a few had already dared to do so. Donatella di Sibio, a 33-year-old shop worker, could not bring herself to leave her parrot behind. \"The staircase has partly collapsed. It's dangerous,\" she agreed as the parrot sat contentedly on its perch in a cage at her feet. Di Sibio had even brought out some parrot food, along with a handful of specially treasured possessions that her mother had stuffed in a plastic bag. \"That was my grandmother,\" she said, pointing to a sepia photograph sticking out from the bag. \"I've lived there all my life,\" said Di Sibio, looking at the 18th century building in which she and her parents shared a flat. \"We'd just got it done up. We spent a lot of money on restoring it. The work finished last month. And now it's wrecked.\"","Id":"world/2009/apr/07/italy-earthquake-laquila","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Italy earthquake: stricken L'Aquila suffers again as aftershocks hit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/07/italy-earthquake-laquila","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/apr/07/italy-earthquake-laquila","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":821,"webPublicationDate":"2009-04-07T23:01:00Z","id":"world/2009/apr/07/italy-earthquake-laquila","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Restaurant review: Apsleys, London SW1","body":"In an age of innocence long before that little poppet on the Glade advert stated his desire to evacuate his bowels at Paul's, the TV ad that drove me closest to psychosis concerned microwavable pizza. It wittered on, in a Mind Your Language-standard Italian accent, about how this is what mamma woulda made if she'd had a £150,000 wood-fired oven (I paraphrase) until a line on the screen announced, \"This product is made in Germany.\" Although there's nothing novel about such fakery (the French never adored Le Piat D'Or, for example), the idea of Germans cracking the market in Italian cooking seemed too outlandish. Then along came a chef called Heinz Beck to snaffle three Michelin stars at his place in Rome. Chances are Beck is a new name to you, as he was until recently to me, and in a less brutal world we'd all have remained blissfully ignorant. Sadly, the Lanesborough hotel disagrees, and decided to pay for it. There are 57 varieties of reason to loathe Apsleys: A Heinz Beck Restaurant, among them the use of that name to justify charging triple-star prices for the work of underlings while its owner does the real business in another land. But the worst of it is a room of such hideously overbearing opulence to inspire a parasexual fantasy featuring gelignite. God knows what the designer intended, but the grandiose chandeliers, plushest of multicoloured carpets, striped chairs and wallpaper, art deco fripperies and general festival of creams and beiges link assonantly with a Roman myth mural to suggest an asylum for obscenely wealthy inmates driven mad by the inability to decide whether they are Regency dandies or Eurotrash swankers. \"My God,\" said my friend clocking the horror, \"one glance and it sucks the soul out of you.\" This psychic dehumidifier of a space suggests neither Germany nor Italy, but a military figure from a country bordering both. From the moment you see it, to adapt the tagline from The French Lieutenant's Woman, it is lost. Nothing the kitchen could conceivably produce could save it, let alone the mixed bunch that emerged. The breads were horrid, especially a bacony roll with a vicious, greasy tang, but the amuse-bouche were as decent as you'd expect when pasta dishes average £15 and main courses twice that. Selflessly, my friend went for the £28 set lunch, and unusually this proved the bigger rip-off. At home you could make his cream of potato soup with \"slow-cooked egg\" for less than a quid, and probably better than this pointless liquid, flecked with tofu cubes (like they really lend flavour) and adorned by \"not the greatest egg in the world\". As for his main course, roast baby chicken is the laziest, most obvious thing with which to flesh out a cheapo menu, and the meat was exceedingly average. The à la carte dishes, both Beck signatures, hinted at talent, notably carbonara fagottelli, parcels of impeccable fresh pasta filled with a cheesy, bacony cream that shot gratifyingly down the throat as you bit into them. Roasted pigeon was faultlessly cooked, particularly the crispy legs, but the jus was indistinct and the dish unmemorable for £29. And if you are going to serve foie gras, you really must mention it on the menu when so many people won't touch the stuff. Then again, catering to a captive audience of arms dealers and rich Americans, with the odd restaurant collector chucked in, perhaps that isn't so important. \"You know who'd love it here?\" said my friend as we dolefully worked through an overly rich chocolate dome and spectacularly tasteless pear cake. \"Wallis Simpson, that's who.\" The chef popped over, a touch nervous after so many plates had returned uncleared, and we told the ritual white lies because he's only obeying hors d'oeuvres. The blame for this excrescence lies with the boss back in Rome for whoring his name, and with a greedy, misguided hotel for pimping it under the comical misapprehension that anyone but the most devoted of foodies will ever have heard it.","Id":"lifeandstyle/2009/nov/07/apsleys-heinz-beck-review-matthew-norman","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webTitle":"Restaurant review: Apsleys, London SW1 | Matthew Norman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/nov/07/apsleys-heinz-beck-review-matthew-norman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2009/nov/07/apsleys-heinz-beck-review-matthew-norman","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":664,"webPublicationDate":"2009-11-07T00:11:50Z","id":"lifeandstyle/2009/nov/07/apsleys-heinz-beck-review-matthew-norman","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"After 10 years of leader's heroic struggle, pizza comes to North Korea","body":"For millions of undernourished North Koreans, the notion of eating at a restaurant belongs strictly to the world of fantasy. And so there is only the grimmest humour in the news that, for the country's ruling elite, Pyongyang's dining options just got a little more impressive: the country now has its first-ever pizzeria. An obsession with pizza stretching back at least 10 years prompted the isolated nation's dictator, Kim Jong-il, to authorise North Korea's first Italian restaurant, which opened in December, according to a pro-Pyongyang newspaper published in Japan. \"General Kim Jong-il said that the people should also be allowed access to the world's famous dishes,\" the restaurant's manager, Kim Sang-Soon, was quoted as saying in Choson Sinbo, a Tokyo-based newspaper seen as a mouthpiece for the regime. Those dining at the restaurant are reportedly treated to pizza and pasta made with wheat flour, butter and cheese flown in from Italy. They are also presumably reaping the benefits of a years-long effort by Kim Jong-il to bring the perfect pizza to his famine-plagued totalitarian state. In the late 1990s, he summoned a team of Italian pizza chefs to Pyongyang to instruct army officers. One of the chefs, Ermanno Furlanis, later recounted how the Italians underwent x-rays, brain scans and urine and blood sampling on arrival, before being sequestered in a marble palace. One of the officers Furlanis was training asked him to specify the precise distance at which olives should be spaced on a pizza, he recalled. Kim seems to have taken a personal interest: while the pizza-making sessions were under way, on a ship anchored offshore, he was apparently witnessed arriving to inspect his officers' progress. \"I am not in the position to say whether it really was him,\" Furlanis later said. \"But our chef, who had no reason to fib, was, for the space of several minutes, utterly speechless. He said he felt as if he had seen God, and I still envy him this experience.\" The training seems not to have met Kim's expectations. According to Choson Sinbo, subsequent efforts to reproduce Italian pizza in North Korea were a process of \"repeated trial and error\", and last year the dictator sent chefs to Naples and Rome to learn more. Finally satisifed, he authorised the restaurant. North Korea, one of the world's poorest countries, was hit by devastating famine in the mid-1990s, with up to 2m people dying, primarily from pneumonia, tuberculosis and diarrhoea. But Kim's passion for fine food is legendary: he is said to be a connoisseur of cognac, French wine, shark-fin soup and sushi. One of his former chefs, writing under a pseudonym, recalled travelling to Iran and Uzbekistan to fetch caviar, flying to Denmark for bacon and China for melons and grapes. He defected, he wrote, by offering to source sea urchins from Japan, from where he never returned. Quoting North Korean defectors, the South Korean news website Daily NK said Kim \"does not eat much, but enjoys picking at various kinds of food, as if just to taste\".","Id":"world/2009/mar/16/north-korea-pizza","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"After 10 years of leader's heroic struggle, pizza comes to North Korea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/16/north-korea-pizza","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/mar/16/north-korea-pizza","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":505,"webPublicationDate":"2009-03-16T02:32:00Z","id":"world/2009/mar/16/north-korea-pizza","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Italy's crucifix case and UK's climate change decision: for God's sake leave religion out of this","body":"Cheer up. The leaves may be coming off the trees, the nights are drawing in. But we are not alone in breeding idiots, as we sometimes tell each other in our egotistical way. Finland bred Soile Lautsi without British help. Who she? No, not David Cameron's European policy adviser or even a board member at General Motors, whose overnight U-turn over the sale of Opel and Vauxhall demonstrates how a once-great car company can be ploughed into the ground in the ruins of Detroit. So who is she? Lautsi is the Finnish-born mum, living in northern Italy, who has just won her eight-year battle to get crucifixes removed from classrooms in the school where her two children were then being taught, though by now they may be graduates. Crucifixes? Italy? Where did Soile she think she was moving to live? Thailand? What will she campaign to ban next? Pizza, the mafia, bling, cheating at football? Little wonder that the papal knickers are in a twist this morning. Pope Benny is on the warpath. All this kerfuffle is the result of a decision by the European court of human rights (ECHR). Unlike the Italian constitutional court, which told Lautsi she was wrong, the ECHR's seven-man panel has decided that state schools must \"observe confessional neutrality\". The ruling may trigger a review of religious symbols on public premises across the continent, says John Hooper, our well-informed man in Rome. I have deliberately paused for a whole, largely pointless paragraph, to allow some readers a stirring in the trousers, before saying – yet again – that the ECHR – which enforces the European convention on human rights – is nothing to do with the European Union. Come on, chaps, admit it you knew that really, didn't you? It was a British-inspired creation from the ruins of wartorn Europe, along the lines of English, American and French bills of rights, adopted in 1950. Irritating though it often is, the court and convention are generally a good thing. Being a member is a condition of EU membership, a point David Cameron might usefully ponder as he fulfils another ill-considered pledge, to overturn the UK Human Rights Act while sorting out the economy with his other hand. But the court's membership – you'll love this bit – is not always made up of judges or even lawyers nominated by member states. And, being human, it makes mistakes, as all courts do. Taking on the papacy over crucifixes in Italian classrooms must surely rank among its own goals. Most Italians behave in as godless a fashion as other Europeans, ignoring papal instruction (otherwise their birth rate would be higher?), but they respect the pieties. So on this one my money is on Pope Benny. The Vatican has been around a long time. As Ken Livingstone put it the other day, when I accused him of a weakness for populist outbursts (we were talking on the phone about populist law and order policies): \"Yes, but I never did anything against the principles of the [18th century] Enlightenment.\" I'm not sure it's true, but it's a show-stopping line that Lautsi ought to ponder over her pasta if she is lucky enough to read this. Alas, the ECHR's judicial folly is not confined to the beastly continent. Here on these unsullied islands Mr Justice Michael Burton did a foolish thing yesterday. He ruled that a disgruntled employee's passionate belief in environmental politics constitutes a philosophical or religious belief that warrants legal protection under the 2003 religion and belief regulations. Duh? If you missed the Guardian's lively account it arose from a wrongful dismissal claim by Tim Nicholson, 42, who took Grainger, Britain's largest residential property company, to an employment tribunal after being made redundant. Why so? Because the firm's boss, Rupert Dickinson, once left his BlackBerry in London on a trip to Ireland and ordered a member of staff to get on a plane and bring it to him, heedless of Grainger's own green-friendly procedures. The man is obviously an oaf, but it's a free country and he chose to waste his firm's money. Grainger says it sacked its green staffer for other \"operational needs of the company\" – ie to save money? – Nicholson says it was because of his beliefs. Not too hard to reconcile both versions, I suspect. What's at stake here is surely tolerance in increasingly pluralistic societies. Seven per cent of Italians are foreign-born, but Italy has not been very good at accommodating multiculturalism. In varying degrees that's true of most of our EU neighbours, as Alan Johnson pointed out in his immigration speech on Monday and France's debate undelines. Italian schools should thus allow Lautsi to keep her kids well away from religious instruction. I'm sure they do; Catholicism ceased to be the state religion in 1984. But surely the incomer should have the wit and tact to accept local traditions? No wonder northern Italy is full of separatist chauvinism, cunningly manipulated by Silvio Berlusconi. As for Tim Nicholson, he now works for a charity promoting greener healthcare. Good for him; he'll be happier there. But Judge Burton's support in allowing him to equate environmentalism with a philosophy akin to religious belief – rather than a purely scientific imperative – is a very unsmart move, I would respectfully contend. It will have the anti-climate change lobby laughing their socks off. It's just what they contend every day. Scepticism is fine, dogma less so, especially among those who claim science is on their side. An excellent letter in yesterday's Financial Times made this point better than I can.","Id":"politics/blog/2009/nov/04/italy-crucifix-climate-change-god","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Italy's crucifix case and UK's climate change decision: for God's sake leave religion out of this | Michael White","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2009/nov/04/italy-crucifix-climate-change-god","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2009/nov/04/italy-crucifix-climate-change-god","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":923,"webPublicationDate":"2009-11-04T11:01:59Z","id":"politics/blog/2009/nov/04/italy-crucifix-climate-change-god","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"A budget guide to European cities","body":"I'm a tightwad with uncontrollable wanderlust. A tricky collision of interests? Absolutely not. When people say you just can't travel on a budget, or that you can't do Paris on the cheap – or Rome, or Barcelona for that matter – it turns me into an unbearable contrarian. I will argue you to death. And this is roughly how I'd do it. First, forget everything you think you know about hostels. Over the past five years there has been a hostel revolution. OK, it probably doesn't rank alongside the more earth-changing revolutions, but you'll have to trust me on this. Across the world, hostels have been smartening up and adding doubles and family rooms that wouldn't look out of place in boutique hotels where you'd pay twice the price. To see a list of my favourites, go to the Guardian's snazzy boutique hostel guide at tinyurl.com/hostelsdontstinkanymore. Second, consider \"glamping\". A horrible word, but an unignorable trend. Just as hostels have made the leap to cater for those with more well-heeled sensibilities, so have campsites. You know those stories you hear about Sienna Miller staying in a boutique tent condo at Glastonbury with custom galaxy ceilings and ylang-ylang tent pegs? Well you can stay in them too. Kind of. See GoGlamping.com for Andalucian yurts, antique camper vans in the Netherlands and retro Airstream trailers in the Midi-Pyrénées Third, think outside the box. The box in question being the eurozone. In case you haven't noticed, the euro has been whopping sterling for a while now, and despite the pound's recent modest rally, the traditional favourites – France, Italy, Spain – are pricier than normal. This isn't to say they aren't do-able (see my mini-guides). Destinations such as the Baltic states, the Balkans and northern Africa are coming of age as budget tourist hotspots, and should be enjoyed before they inflate. Fourth, picnic. An obvious one. There's no rule saying you have to eat in restaurants the second you leave the British seaboard. Shopping in a local supermarket or grocers and eating al fresco is, I believe, one of the most cultural things you can do while travelling. When in Rome, go to the Roman equivalent of Tesco and stock up on some decent prosciutto and fresh-baked focaccia, and then take it to the Spanish Steps and chow down. Pick up a honking brie in Lyon and munch it by the Rhône. If that sounds a bit unromantic, do your homework on street markets and food fairs before you go. Fifth, compare like mad. As with other sectors, travel comparison sites have proliferated over the past year. For flights, go to kayak.co.uk. For car hire, I recommend traveljungle.co.uk; for insurance squaremouth.co.uk; and for packages travelsupermarket.com. Hotels are the most fun. It's amazing the range of prices you can find for the same hotel room on the same night – have a play with trivago.co.uk, hotelly.com, and hotelscombined.com. Finally, keep an eye on financial crises. It's never been cheaper to visit Iceland. Paris Transport Buy a Paris Visite Card, the equivalent of a London Travelcard, from €8.80. ratp.info Cheap eats Fodor's has a good run-down of budget eats in among the gastro elites … including the superb L'As du Fallafel in the Marais. See tinyurl.com/parischeap. Museums Consider timing your trip to coincide with the first Sunday of each month, when all national museums are free. If you're under 25, the Louvre offers free entry after 6pm on Fridays. Children Paris's antique carousels are one of the city's most iconic sights, and don't exclude nostalgic mums and dads. Find them at the bottom of Sacré-Coeur, the Luxembourg gardens, the Jardins des Tuileries and Parc du Champ de Mars. Hotels My top budget Paris recommendation is the Eldorado in Montmartre: a superb location with cute, antique rooms from €35 per night. eldoradohotel.fr. Entertainment The Parisian wing of Time Out, written by locals, is on the city's pulse. For trendy night owls, the current districts du jour are Oberkampf and the eastern areas of Belleville and Ménilmontant. Useful information French youth hostels are notoriously uninspiring, and those in Paris are no exception. Budgeters should plump for a cheap B&B if stretched, see 2binparis.com for options from €35 per night. Top tip The municipal bike scheme, Velib, requires a credit card from visitors in order to take a deposit. Don't be put off, it's one of the most enjoyable and cheapest ways of seeing the city. The first half an hour is free, the second €1, the third €2 and so on. Berlin Transport The CityTourCard includes unlimited public transport in the city and discounts on more than 50 attractions from €15.90 for 48 hours. citytourcard.com. Cheap eats Berlin is one of the cheapest places in western Europe to eat out. Treat yourself. Alternatively, feast on the city's super kebabs (Europe's best) and staple currywursts. Sights The Brewers Berlin Tours are operated by enthusiastic young English-speaking historians and do a superb day-long Berlin crash course from €12. Highly recommended. Hotels The Circus Hostel in trendy Mitte is a superb budget option, and has just opened up a hotel on the opposite side of Rosenthaler Platz, with boutique doubles from €78 per night. circus-berlin.de. Children Knut, Knut and more Knut. The famous polar bear at Berlin zoo has become a global phenomenon. zoo-berlin.de. Entertainment Pick up a copy of Exberliner for €2.50 at most news agents. It's one of the best expat magazines in Europe, and has superb nightlife tips for a city that prides itself on its late-night offerings. Useful information Berlin's Schönefeld is the base of Germanwings, the budget carrier that services lots of parts of Europe that Ryanair and easyJet don't reach – particularly good for obscure Balkan destinations. Well worth considering as a long stop-over on the way to Croatia, Albania, Serbia or Bosnia. Top tip Berlin is home to a collection of atmospheric \"honour-system\" wine bars around the Zionskirchplatz in Mitte, where guests rent a glass for €1 and then pay as they wish for unlimited wine. Go to weinerei.com. Istanbul Transport Buses and the long-awaited metro do a good job linking up the city, but heavy traffic often renders them redundant. Neatly, taxis here are very cheap. Always negotiate the price first. Cheap eats In the mosque-laden historical district of Sultanahmet, just across the Galata bridge at the port of Eminönü, wildly popular fish sandwiches are sold straight from bobbing boats. A must. Sights The vast majority of Istanbul's stunning mosques are free to enter when not conducting prayers, including the Blue Mosque, Süleymaniye Mosque and New Mosque. Hotels The World House is a hostel-cum-hotel in the vibrant Tunel area, with excellent value double rooms from €43. worldhouseistanbul.com. Children A difficult city with youngsters in tow. But the Princes' Islands are a fantastic getaway, an hour by boat from the centre of town. Cars are banned; the only form of public transport is horse and cart. Entertainment A lot of the swanky bars and clubs in the buzzing European Beyoglu district can match London for prices. Instead, perch yourself at a bar on Nevizade, the area's most raucous, sociable street, and sip on a glass of raki, for the equivalent of a couple of quid. Useful information Ditch the guidebook. Istanbul is home to three superb English-language blogs written by locals; istanbuleats.com, pukkaliving.com and istanbultrails.com. Top tip Over the summer, Istanbul moves to the rooftops, with various open-air bars and restaurants doing a roaring trade. The most popular are pricey, but there are a handful on the wonderful, sloping Cezayir Street in Beyoglu that rarely turn up in the guidebooks, and are considerably better value than the big names. Barcelona Transport The Barcelona City Card allows free travel on all public transport, and includes a huge range of discounts at museums, restaurants and more. Two-day passes from €25, see barcelona.com. Cheap eats Don't buy pudding in a restaurant. It's a terrible waste, for in Barcelona you're never far from a cafe or street vendor selling churros, the fried dough pastry which is something of a religion in Spain. €2 max. Museums Most Barcelona museums are free on Sunday afternoons. Failing that, the €20 articketBCN includes entry to several otherwise pricey museums, including the MACBA and Miro. Available at most museums and tourist offices. Hotels It's tough to find good cheap hotels in Barcelona, but the Hotel España is excellent value, with interiors designed by celebrated modernist architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner and rooms from €90 per night. Triples are particularly good value, from €135. Children Take a ride on a funicular tram to the hilltop Tibidabo amusement park, where some of the rides haven't changed for a century. Go to tibidabo.es. Entertainment When the weather's right, the best entertainment in the city can be found on Barcelona's plazas. The Plaza Reial is particularly popular with locals, ringed with bars that spill out on to the street. Useful information If you're eating in a bar, there is often a price hierarchy in Barcelona: the stool is cheaper that an inside table, which is cheaper than an outside table. Top tip Barcelona is the home of the le cool publishing mini empire. Its Barcelona book is one of the most beautiful and in-the-know guidebooks ever made. An absolute bargain at €16. lecoolbook.com. Rome Transport When in Rome, use the buses (an ancient ruin-heavy underbelly has restricted any extensive metro system). A day pass costs €4. Cheap eats Every Rome neighbourhood has a trattoria serving up mama's cooking for remarkably little. Ask your hotel cleaner for their favourite. Alternatively, head to the daily market at Forno Campo dé Fiori for superb \"pizza bianca\" (flatbread). Sights The majority of Rome's big hitters are free, including the Vatican, the Spanish Steps, the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain and the Forum. Hotels Close to Termini station, the excellent Beehive hostel-cum-hotel has dorms from €25 per night and doubles from €70 (the-beehive.com). Children The 80-hectare Villa Borghese park is a great place for kids to let off steam while you admire the spectacular outdoor temples, statues and fountains. If it's too hot, aim them at the Explora, the children's museum of Rome, where interactive exhibitions are specifically designed for youngsters www.mdbr.it. Entertainment The Spettacolo Romano ticket office at 20 Via Bari near Piazza Bologna often sells last-minute, half-price tickets to performances at Rome's biggest theatres. Useful information The EuroCheapo blog, a good resource for budgeting all over Europe, has a particularly good Rome section. Top tip On Sundays catch the number 8 tram from Porta Maggiore to the sprawling Porta Portese street market in Trastevere. The whole area is rife with souvenir bargains, and the journey there includes a glide past the Colosseum.","Id":"money/2009/jul/11/cheap-holidays-abroad","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webTitle":"A budget guide to European cities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/jul/11/cheap-holidays-abroad","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2009/jul/11/cheap-holidays-abroad","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":1775,"webPublicationDate":"2009-07-10T23:06:26Z","id":"money/2009/jul/11/cheap-holidays-abroad","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Letters and blogs","body":"What's really smart Computers themselves are not predicting a Singularity that will transform their powers (Will machines outsmart man?, November 6).

In this uncertain economic climate many of us are having to plan holidays more carefully and with people reluctant to give up on their main summer sun holiday there has been speculation that it's our city breaks that will be sacrificed. But apparently this is not the case. According to Ted Wake, director of sales and marketing for short break specialist Kirker Holidays, the demise of the city break has been greatly exaggerated: \"For us 2008 was a record year for city break bookings, and we've seen an increase in bookings for this year too.\" Similarly, Lastminute.com claims its city break sales are up more than 15% compared with this time last year. Despite endless newspaper articles pointing out that our weakened pound will go much further outside the eurozone, European cities are proving surprisingly resilient. \"We are still seeing strength in destinations inside the eurozone,\" says Alison Couper, communications director for Hotels.com and Expedia.co.uk. \"The lure of cities such as Barcelona, Madrid, Venice, Marseille and Paris is endless.\" Paris and Barcelona still feature in Lastminute.com's top 10 best sellers, and for Cities Direct bookings to Italy are substantially up on last year, with Rome continuing to be its best seller. Jace Quick, managing director for Cities Direct, says: \"People have taken note of the rising euro, but for a two- or three-night break it hasn't really put people off.\" In fact, the dire exchange rate has worked in many travellers' favour, with hoteliers in the rest of Europe having to lower their prices to attract British holidaymakers. Generally, city centre hotels launch three-nights-for-the-price-of-two deals in the quieter seasons - in July and August and from November to March - but this year many are offering them all year round. \"People are grabbing these three-for-two deals, especially on the more expensive hotels, as it means they're getting better value for money than ever before,\" says Kirker's Ted Wake. Travellers are also benefiting from complimentary upgrades that weren't available in the past. \"People aren't necessarily paying for upgrades like they have before, so we're in a position to negotiate with the hotel to offer free upgrades.\" Rather than cancelling, savvy travellers are simply looking for better value when they book their city break. Thanks to the internet, it's never been easier to shop around for that fabulous deal or free upgrade, and it's never been easier for travellers to tailor-make a trip to fit their budget: those looking for the best- value city break may drop the star rating of their hotel, stay further outside the city centre or stay two nights instead of three. Research carried out by Cheapflights.co.uk has shown that there are some great European city air fare deals around compared with a year ago. Deals to Nice in March 2009 averaged at £28 one way, 75% lower than in March 2008, while deals to Barcelona were around £47, showing a 40% drop. Choosing which city you visit in a foreign country can really make a difference to how much you spend, too. Ted Wake says: \"Naples and Palermo, in Sicily, are both similar in that you get a wonderful sense of 19th-century Italy which has not been done up to suit tourists, and they are much more affordable than, say, Venice or Florence.\" A cup of coffee in St Mark's Square in Venice, for example, could set you back about £5, whereas a coffee in one of Naples' most upmarket cafes on Piazza Trieste e Trento will cost around £2. So, forget steering clear of the eurozone - if you shop around for the right deal and choose your destination wisely, there really is no better time to snap up a bargain city break to Europe. Five great value short breaks Nice The Nice Riviera Pass (nicerivierapass.com, €24 for one day) gives free admission to more than a dozen sights, including the Musée National Marc Chagall and the Musée Renoir, and free travel on the Nice Le Grand Tour open-top bus, which goes as far as Antibes and Monaco.

Water taxis are the cheapest way to explore the Amalfi Coast; avoid Positano, where restaurant prices are triple that of Naples, and visit the lesser-known town of Atrani. In Naples, head for Fratelli La Bufala on 18 Via Medina, where a huge pizza covered in buffalo mozzarella and buffalo meat costs from €3.50 to €7.

Contini, 52, was captured unarmed late on Friday in a small second-floor apartment in Naples from where he allegedly acted as godfather of an empire dealing in drugs, extortion, prostitution, money lending and illegal immigration. Always smartly dressed, Contini is nicknamed \"O Romano\" for his business connections in Rome. His whereabouts was discovered through a conversation overheard by police bugs, in which he gave detailed instructions on the food to be brought to him by an elderly woman on his payroll and living with her six children in the same building. To avoid detection, he had not left the flat for months, keeping fit on a treadmill and watching satellite TV. He did not risk using phones or the internet, instead issuing orders through written notes, \"pizzini\", which he handed to visiting subordinates. After analysing the pizzini found in the flat, police expect to make further arrests. In a further effort to evade detection, he had not seen his wife Maria Aiata since Christmas. And during his stay in the flat he avoided sending clothes out for laundry by ordering in a constant supply of clean underwear - police found a large quantity of his dirty underwear inside the flat, as well as a wardrobe of designer clothing. The laundry precaution was an attempt to avoid the fate of Sicilian boss Bernardo Provenzano in 2006, tracked down at a remote hideaway when police followed a supply of freshly washed clothes sent by his wife. As police burst into Contini's flat on Friday, he had been sitting down to eat a pizza with his neighbours; after a half- hearted attempt to leap from a window, he gave himself up and complimented officers on their detective work, according to the Naples newspaper Il Mattino. On the list of Italy's 30 most wanted fugitives, Contini had been taken into custody in 1994 while holidaying with his family in the northern Italian winter resort of Cortina - but in 2000 was released and disappeared back into hiding when his arrest warrant expired before he had been sentenced. The clan he allegedly heads is in the so-called Secondigliano Alliance, a powerful player within Naples's Camorra network of clans. In 2005 he was sentenced in absentia to 20 years in jail for mob association and extortion. He has also been accused of murder. Recently he had begun to recycle money through jewellery stores in Naples, Il Mattino reported. Contini had \"built one of the most dangerous and violent cartels\", alleged Francesco Forgione, president of parliament's anti-mafia commission. Based on their combined income, the mafia clans are reputed to be collectively bigger earners than any company in Italy, but recent arrests have rocked the organisations. The Sicilian boss Salvatore Lo Piccolo, on the run since 1983 and considered an heir apparent to Provenzano, was captured last month near Palermo. This month, fellow Cosa Nostra boss Daniele Emmanuello was gunned down by police in Sicily as he fled from his hideaway in his pyjamas while attempting to swallow pizzini. \"We said that we would catch them one by one,\" Amato said. \"That's what we're doing.\" Police are having less success rounding up mobsters from the 'Ndrangheta, the shadowy Calabrian mafia behind last summer's killing of six Italians in Duisburg, Germany. So tight is its family structure that it rarely produces turncoats for the police to work with. \"Naples gangsters, by contrast, often sing when we arrest them,\" said one law enforcer. Calabrian mobsters have also built links with Colombian cocaine smugglers.","Id":"world/2007/dec/17/italy.tomkington","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Police pick off another godfather in mafia war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/17/italy.tomkington","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2007/dec/17/italy.tomkington","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":615,"webPublicationDate":"2007-12-17T23:58:51Z","id":"world/2007/dec/17/italy.tomkington","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Fancy a Chindian?","body":"It is the episode of Goodness Gracious Me that everyone remembers. A group of drunk Indians decide to go for an \"English\" at the end of an evening's drinking in Mumbai. One demands \"the blandest thing on the menu\", the women cluck over the waiter's \"lovely pasty skin\" and the head of the table orders 24 plates of chips, ignoring well-meaning advice that \"you might have ordered too much\". The sketch endures not just because it puts the post-pub curry crowd bang to rights, but also because of its utter preposterousness: what Indian in their right mind would choose an overcooked carvery over a feast of brightly coloured, piquant delights? Yet despite Indians nursing a well-deserved feeling of culinary superiority, you would be wrong to assume that this self-satisfaction means that in India everyone just eats Indian. Likewise Chinese in China, Thai in Thailand and just about everywhere else the world over. From Bangkok to Brest, Beijing to Barcelona, gastronomic globalisation - led depressingly by McDonald's, with its 26,500 branches in 119 countries - has meant that few culinary cultures are hermetically sealed. In India, people often go for a Chinese. Or rather, an Indianised version of Chinese that some call Chindian. Dishes tend to be flavoured with spices not normally found in Chinese cuisine, such as cumin, coriander and turmeric. Given India's large vegetarian population, paneer, cauliflower and potato are also far more prevalent, along with garlic, ginger and chillis. Popular Chindian dishes include Manchurian chicken, which has a sweet and salty brown sauce, various Sichuan recipes and Hakka noodles. Narrow and flat, almost square in shape, Hakka noodles are made with durum wheat, with or without eggs. They are stir-fried with vegetables and mixed with a hot, vinegar-based sauce, and sold from dhabas (roadside stalls). The name comes from the Hakka people, the tribe of Chinese who first moved to Calcutta in the late 1700s. There is still a large Chinatown in Calcutta today. \"Indo-Chinese is very popular with middle- and upper-class Indians,\" says Tishani Doshi, a writer and dancer based in Madras. Much to her amusement, Doshi recently had her first Indian meal in Britain and was surprised not to have encountered a single dish she had ever eaten in India. \"It's probably how a Chinese person would feel eating at a Chinese restaurant in India,\" she says. \"I couldn't believe how heavy the 'Indian' food was in London, and it reminded me of the feeling I often get when I go for a Chinese back home: completely stuffed and slightly bloated. I can't imagine that Chinese people regularly eat anything that heavy.\" So if the Indians eat Chinese, what about the Chinese? Given China's size and population (1.3 billion people at the last count), tastes obviously vary hugely from province to province. Alex Lee is an American-born Chinese who lives in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province in southern China. He says that the most popular restaurants are American chains such as KFC and McDonald's - but with a twist. \"They have changed the menus,\" he says, \"to accommodate Chinese tastes. You will have things like a seared Xinjiang spiced chicken sandwich from McDonald's or a fried chicken burrito à la Peking duck style, with scallions and hoisin.\" Wine consultant Fongyee Walker lives in Beijing and says China is so vast that, especially for the less well-off, \"foreign\" simply means food from another province. \"Here in Beijing, the poorer city residents will eat such 'foreign food' as Sichuan snack food,\" she says, adding that food snobs in the city like to complain that the Sichuan influence has wrecked the food in northern China. \"Also popular are the low-level Xinjiang snacks - such as sticky dried fruit cake and lamb kebabs and nang bread - which come from the far west but are so popular they're almost part of the local scene.\" But, she says, pizza is widely eaten in China, adding that even her staunchly traditional ayi (maid) occasionally dines at Pizza Hut. \"The pizza isn't what you would call a real Italian style - they definitely prefer the deep-pan approach,\" she says. Walker recently met a woman who moved to Beijing from Italy 20 years ago and runs an Italian cheese factory called Ji Kang Food in the outskirts of the city. Italian cuisine also goes down well in Japan. A survey in Japan-guide.com found that the majority of respondents' (33%) favourite restaurant meal was Italian, compared with just 21% saying sushi. And the genre breakdown at a restaurant review website such as Asku, which covers eateries all over the country, shows just how the Italians, along with the Chinese, are dominating the culinary scene. In Tokyo 2,681 Chinese restaurants are listed, alongside 2,169 Italian, plus some 491 classed as \"spaghetti/pizza\" restaurants. Pizza, it would seem, is loved almost the world over. But what do the Italians themselves eat when they venture away from their own cuisine? The stereotype is that they are conservative where food is concerned and that anyone above the age of about 30 views foreign food - which may mean dishes from a neighbouring town or just anything not cooked by their mamma - with the deepest possible suspicion. Rome-based food writer Maureen B Fant says that while this is of course a sweeping generalisation, it remains largely true. \"I grew up in New York, and we used to say I feel like Lebanese, or I feel like Chinese, or let's see what that Persian place is like,\" she says. \"You don't get that here. The few 'ethnic' places still tend to be either greatly diluted for Italian tastes, or holes in the wall that cater for new immigrants.\" However, exotic ingredients are creeping into the more creative kitchens, she says, \"And there definitely are more exotic places than there used to be. But if we're talking about mainstream trattorias and restaurants, when you want a change from the local fare, you're still (for now) more likely to think Sicily or Sardinia than Asia.\" This sort of culinary exclusivity is often associated with France, but according to recent research, the favourite dish of the French is not coq au vin, escargots or even steak-frites, but couscous. A survey commissioned by the French weekly magazine VSD asked 960 people to arrange a series of dishes in order of preference. Though the list was overwhelmingly composed of traditional French dishes, such as bœuf bourgignon, bouillabaisse and beef tartare, couscous came out top. Not only that, but the dish has become a symbol of modern, multicultural France - indeed a conservative politician once described the wave of North African immigration as \"conquest by couscous\". Nigh on every town in France has at least one couscous restaurant, where immigrants and locals join to eat cheap bowls of the stuff. Missing from all this culinary cross-pollination is British food. But there are some brave souls who are determined to take some of our national dishes international. And one of the most ambitious must be Manju Malhi, who grew up in London and, from next month, will be presenting a cookery series on British food, such as shepherd's pie and bangers and mash, for India's largest commercial television channel. \"Curry has become so popular in Britain, I thought I'd swap it around,\" she said recently. \"I cannot name one English restaurant in Delhi and I wondered, why so? People here think that English food is bland with meat and nothing else. I am trying to show them that there is good cooking in the UK as well.\".","Id":"world/2007/jun/20/india.china","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Helen Pidd on eating 'foreign' food in India China and Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/20/india.china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2007/jun/20/india.china","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":1260,"webPublicationDate":"2007-06-20T22:51:27Z","id":"world/2007/jun/20/india.china","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Bolognese to that","body":"Delizia! The Epic History of the Italians and Their Food by John Dickie Hodder & Stoughton £20, pp231 For us in the 21st century, Italian food is the cuisine of affluence. As John Dickie, reader in Italian Studies at UCL points out: 'Italy has become the model to imitate when it comes to making ingredients, cooking them and eating them.' There are now trattorias for those who can afford them in Bangkok and Beijing . The ingredients most prized by rich gastronomes are Italian - white truffles, Manni olive oil, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, aged balsamic vinegar, Amalfi lemons - as are today's fashionable foodstuffs, such as buffalo mozzarella, ricotta, polenta ... the list is a long one. Yet we think of most of these as having a peasant provenance. These are among several contradictions presented to the student of the history of Italian eating in Delizia! A serious history of the subject is needed for reasons beyond the current popularity of the cuisine, however; much nonsense is written about the subject, with a lot of dead wood to prune before we can get at the fruit. First, the problem of the meaning of 'Italian'. The evidence of American immigrants even in the 20th century was that those from the north of Italy did not even recognise many of the dishes of the south. And vice versa - Neapolitan pizza was thought by the Piedmontese to be dirty, though they only learnt to eat pasta al dente when the practice spread there 'from Naples in the early 1800s'. With the exceptions of Romans and Tuscans, the Italian tongue was, for the minority of late-19th-century inhabitants of the peninsula who knew it, 'a second language, a written language, a language of public affairs and literature'. Second, there are the myths to be dispelled. Marco Polo did not bring back pasta - 'pasta secca was present in Sicily at least a century before Marco Polo was born'. When Catherine de Medici married the future Henry II in 1533, she did not take her cooks with her and teach the French to cook. (The influence has always gone the other way; 'in the 18th and 19th centuries, the nobility of southern Italy and Sicily employed a monsu' - a monsieur or French-trained cook.) Medieval cooks did not use spices to disguise flavours, but because they liked heavily spiced foods; spices were expensive and their use ostentatious. Before the voyages of Columbus, there were no tomatoes, chillies, potatoes, beans except for broad beans, pumpkins, courgettes or maize, though maize caught on rapidly. Then there is the idea that Italian food is peasant fare. In fact, Italian food is not only regional but urban, and most great dishes are the product of cities - artichokes and offal belong to Rome, oversized beefsteaks to Florence, pesto to Genoa and so on. The truth about the peasant diet was that it consisted largely of our most fashionable food, polenta, to the extent that many immigrants fetched up at Ellis Island with pellagra, the nasty illness cause by a niacin-deficient diet of nothing but maize porridge. What is there to emulate about Italy, then? Oddly, it's the Italian resistance to fashion, their food conservatism. It's true that the reason for the dearth of supermarkets in Italy is political and had to do with keeping the Christian Democrats in office, but it's taken half a century to sell as much industrially made fresh pasta to Italians as to the rest of us (Luxembourgers eat the most per head). Italy has more EU-protected food products than most EU nations - 155 items - part of what Dickie calls 'Europe's move towards quality produce aimed at elite consumers'. A noble movement has grown up to protect such foods all over the world. It's called slow food, but it's led from Italy, by a charismatic old leftie, Carlo Petrini. In the final chapter of his important but slightly under-annotated book, Dickie sees only the hopeful, appealing side of slow food. Thus he misses the internal contradictions of a world movement whose mission is to impose an Italian model on all of us, whose anarcho-syndicalist organisation is led from the top down, and whose 'praesidia' (protected foodstuffs) and 'convivia' (chapters) use Stalinist language in the service of good taste and good food. And I wish he'd considered the gastronomic puzzle of why Americans use the completely obscure Italian dialect word arugula for rocket (Eruca vesicaria), which has a good English name and has probably grown in Britain since Roman times.","Id":"books/2007/aug/19/houseandgarden.features","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Review: Delizia! by John Dickie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/aug/19/houseandgarden.features","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2007/aug/19/houseandgarden.features","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts","wordcount":755,"webPublicationDate":"2007-08-18T23:06:11Z","id":"books/2007/aug/19/houseandgarden.features","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Change here, and here, and here ...","body":"Certain kinds of reference books attract certain kinds of personality. These personalities tend to be male. Some might argue that they have been damaged at some key stage in their development. The 55-year-old accountant studying Wisden, the 75-year-old bishop wetting his forefinger to turn the pages of Debrett's - surely some tragedy must have marked their childhoods for them to derive such pleasure from the batting averages of TW Hopkinson in Loamshire's 1948-49 season or the lineage of the de Waldegrave family, to whom the bishop is not even distantly related. As someone who can happily pass an hour or two in the company of a railway timetable, the question equally applies to me. Why do I keep so many of them - Newman's Indian Bradshaw, Cooks Continental. Italy's Pozzorario Generale, British Railways (Scottish Region) for 1965? Why in these few slack hours am I not reading Proust instead? Like travel writing, the timetable certainly appeals to that fading species, the \"armchair traveller\"; but its greater charm is its ability to set and solve puzzles. I may never see Friedrichshafen and its airship sheds, but how interesting to devise a route that could take me there on the way from St Pancras to Rome, with the proviso that I must avoid Paris and spend only one night in a hotel. Long ago, the headmaster of Repton public school would set similar tasks as punishment exercises: a boy would be handed a copy of Bradshaw and told to find a way, say, between Great Yarmouth and Exeter without touching London. Long before Game Boys and PlayStations (and unlike travel books proper), the timetable provided the challenge of interactivity. George Bradshaw, a Quaker printer in Manchester, invented the format in 1841, the timings and route of each train expressed in a grid system, with stations listed vertically and times horizontally. Six years later he published the first edition of his monthly Continental Railway Guide, which is what Phileas Fogg takes with him on his 80-day journey around the world. As railways expanded across Europe it grew to a thousand pages and became inconvenient to carry. In 1873, Thomas Cook saw an opportunity for a thinner and more convenient guide - edited highlights, you might say - and Cooks Continental was born. From 1988, it has been known as Cooks European, the word \"continental\" belonging to an era when people shunned tap water in Paris, but in essence it remains the same as the first volume I bought in the early 1970s. Overnight sleepers are fewer, many named trains have vanished (no more Rheingold or Wiener Walzer), but the little maps of city termini remain and the routes covered number nearly 2,000. Like no other book - at least not one available for £13.50 - it demonstrates the rich complexity of Europe: all those trains, all those junctions, all those travellers and platforms and the smell of coffee in station buffets. So much to be seen that will never all be seen, and can only be imagined. The journey You can reach Venice in a day from St Pancras. It takes about 15 hours, changing four times, travelling through France to Lyon, then on to Milan and up to north-east Italy. Or you can take the scenic route, following wiggly lines that zig-zag across the continent, much as you might take B roads instead of the motorway. All you need for the latter is the Thomas Cook European rail timetable and map, an InterRail pass and a fistful of euros. Back in February I unfurled the map over the kitchen table and started to plot a route, sticking wherever possible to the green lines, which denote their scenic status. There are famously panoramic routes such as the San Bernadino pass through the Alps, but I was after beauty on a budget, and was determined to travel without paying an extra penny on top of my rail pass, or booking in advance. Four months later I was standing at Brussels station on a Saturday morning. As weekenders wheeled their cases across the marble floor direction Bruges, I hoisted my battered old rucksack onto my back and changed platforms - the first of countless changes over the next six days. Day one: The first stop is Marloie. An hour to spare in this unremarkable Belgian town gave me just enough time to sink a beer and buy a baguette and cheese for a picnic. Back on the train I headed to Rivage, then south into the heart of the Ardennes through deep gorges and lush valleys. Trois-Ponts, Vielsalm, Gouvy, Clervaux - the stations slipped by. For much of the journey, a river runs alongside the track and I saw people in kayaks and rafts. The world whizzed past my window, and I hardly noticed the time pass as the gentle rocking of the train lulled me into a state of relaxation. I spent the night in a quiet town called Wiltz in Luxembourg, which has a brewery, a football team and a couple of auberges. Day two: From Luxembourg, I headed out east along the river Moselle to the point where it joins the Rhine, which has a railway running down both banks. At St Goarshausen I joined the daytrippers crossing the Rhine by ferry to St Goar, mingling with the crowds as a classic car rally passed through. I climbed up to the castle and hung over the battlements watching the long barges piled with coal navigating the far bend in the river. Hopping back across the river, I moved on to Rudesheim, a quaint old town with timber-framed houses set among vineyards. I explored the narrow passageways and took the cable car up the hill, floating away above rows of vines in the late afternoon sun. I hadn't even heard of this pretty village before I consulted the map that morning. I had passed through some underwhelming places but my meandering route was also revealing little gems such as Rudesheim. My bed for the night was at the Lindenwirt, an old shuttered hotel with a dining terrace. After a foaming weissbier and a plate of pork, I slept soundly. Day three: Monday's leg of the journey turned into a round-the-houses epic as I took an unplanned tour of the Odenwald, a little-known region between Frankfurt and Stuttgart. There were villages perched on wooded hilltops, small farms, and whole fields of buttercups. It looked like good hiking country. After six more changes I connected to the Schwarzwaldbahn (Black Forest railway). Built between 1866 and 1873, the line, which runs from Offenburg to Singen is a fine example of outrageous railway engineering. There are 39 tunnels in total, each one named with a plaque that you can just catch as you whip past. Every couple of minutes you're plunged into darkness, then comes a flashing glimpse of misty mountainside or the foaming river below. As the track twists and turns, you snatch views through flickering pines into the valley below. Like the latest ride in a theme park, it was almost worth turning round and doing it again. And again. I picked it up in Hausach and stopped en route in Triberg, whose claim to fame is the world's largest cuckoo clock. Day four: I crossed into Switzerland at Lake Konstanz, and spent a morning picking my way along the south side, hopping from one train to another, until I reached Bregenz in Austria. There I joined an express train through the Arlberg Pass. The guard shook his head when I asked if there were any windows that opened so I could take photos but he did recommend I sit on the right-hand side up to Langen, and on the left on the way down. It was dramatic stuff. The mountains had snowy peaks and the rivers were in full flood. The valley floors were swathes of green grass with chalets scattered up towards the tree line. On we climbed until the only way ahead was through a tunnel deep inside a mountain. Finally we emerged at St Anton, where I stopped for some tea in the resort and a stroll in the thin air. Then it was downhill all the way to Innsbruck, where I stayed at the Hotel Weisses Kreuz in the centre of the old town. Day five: From Innsbruck a smart Austrian train in red and white livery climbed up through the foothills of the Tyrol. Gradually, the terrain became more rugged and the escarpments steeper until at the Italian border at Brennero we were hedged in by mountains in cloud. In this South Tyrolean town, things looked Italian - salamis hanging in the delicatessen, caribinieri drinking espresso in the cafe - but people spoke to me in German. As we rolled down a long, broad fertile valley towards Bolzano and then on to Trento the roof tiles turned from grey slate to terracotta and the mountain pastures gave way to vineyards. From there, the main line follows the river to Verona, but the scenic route took me via Bassano del Grappa. Toiling up the hillside, the two-coacher curled round until it presented a panoramic view of the city, encircled by craggy mountaintops dusted with snow. The railway passed through the middle of villages, alongside backyards and gardens, vines and flowering orchards close enough to touch. We stopped at 22 stations in less than three hours until, with a thunderstorm threatening, we wound through a huge foreboding chasm out into the flatlands that extend to the lagoon. I rested up at Hotel Al Castello in Bassano, a small jewel of a town, an easy day-trip from Venice. Built around three small piazzas, it's the kind of place where you feel you don't have to do much. There's a fine old wooden bridge over the river where the locals gather for evening aperitifs at the Nardini grapperia. I drank, debated football with new-found friends, and filled up on authentic pizza for supper. Day six: My final morning and I had time to browse the market where the entire town seemed to have congregated, followed by a leisurely lunch of the local speciality - white asparagus with chopped egg. I'd put the Thomas Cook timetable through its paces (or perhaps that should be the other way round), catching more than 30 trains across seven countries in six days. You could easily make a similar journey with fewer stops and connections. But I recommend taking it slowly, lingering for a day or two in places you've happened upon. Within a couple of hours I was sitting on the prow of a vaporetto enjoying the view of the palazzos along the Grand Canal, feeling as if I had had two holidays in one.

But there are people who love reading outside. When the satanist, poet and self-proclaimed sex-addict Aleister Crowley set out in 1902 to climb K2, he insisted on lugging with him the complete works of Milton, Shelley and Wordsworth, arguing that 'the almost universal mental and moral instability of Europeans engaged in exploring' was due to 'the lack of proper intellectual relaxation rather than to any irritations and hardships'. In 1933, Patrick Leigh Fermor set out to walk from the Hook of Holland to Constantinople, and he packed in his knapsack The Oxford Book of English Verse and the first volume of the Loeb Horace . There's also a venerable tradition of wayfaring songs and stories ( The Canterbury Tales , for instance) which I guess constitutes a kind of outdoors reading. I like reading outside, not least because books tend to get marked - by raindrops, mud smears, trapped sand grains, pressed flowers - in ways you remember if you return to them months or years later. It's not always a happy recollection. I've got a bashed-up hardback copy of Apsley Cherry-Garrard's The Worst Journey in the World (Penguin) which weighs just over 3lb and which I hauled up a Himalayan mountain, hoping that Cherry-Garrard's quiet heroism would be an inspiration. But by the time I needed the inspiration, I was too ill from altitude to be able to read, and beyond Apsley's help. What books go well with what landscapes? For riverbank and lakeside holidays, there's Norman Maclean's masterpiece A River Runs Through It (Chicago Univeristy Press), a novel which is about trout fishing only in the sense that Moby-Dick is about whaling. If you're off to stay in or near a wood or forest, such places come alive in Roger Deakin's recent Wildwood (Penguin) and in Italo Calvino's The Baron in the Trees (Minerva). If you're away wild camping, Nan Shepherd's The Living Mountain (kept admirably in print by Canongate Classics) might remind you of why canvas is worth it. Shepherd writes exquisitely of sleeping out: the nightly opera of the moon and stars and the power of darkness to make even familiar places excitingly strange. Dawn and dusk, she also notes, are often the times at which landscapes are most subtle and most surprising, in their modalities of light and in the boldness of birds and animals. For walking or trekking holidays, Leigh Fermor's A Time of Gifts (John Murray), an account of his trans-European walk, is the perfect vade mecum, alternating as it does between the stories and visions of each day's effort and the warmth and hospitality of each night's shelter. I reread it last December, mostly by firelight or torchlight, while walking in the Minya Konka region of the eastern Himalayas (near the Sichuan/Tibetan border), along with the Selected Essays of Wendell Berry (Golgonooza Press), the American farmer and philosopher who writes brilliantly about the experience of being in a canoe on a rising river or finding an old path in a wooded valley. VS Pritchett remarks at the start of Marching Spain (1928) that he never bothers to pack a book he wants to read when walking, on the grounds that he had 'long lost all my sentimental illusions about the joys of the open road with a \"beloved classic\" in one's pocket'. I'm off on a three-day wander down the East Anglian coast in August. The plan is to pack Marching Spain (Hogarth Press) and see if I get round to reading it. · Robert Macfarlane's The Wild Places is published by Granta Time to be a treasure hunter The country cottage By Tessa Hadley The idea of a crowd of family or friends cooped up together for weeks in a cottage in the country feels like a short story even before anything begins to happen: everyone translated out of their ordinary lives, with all those long hours to fill. (Whether the story is a comedy or a dark parable depends on who's writing it.) It's bound to rain and the books you find on the shelves in the cottage will be a doomed miscellany, tainted with rejection, pages swollen with damp, so it's a good idea to take something with you, big enough to get lost inside. Last summer, I reread Stendhal's The Charterhouse of Parma (Penguin), drawn deep into his picture of the political life of those old Italian city states, comical and personal, arbitrary, everything on a human scale. It was years since I'd read the novel; I had just about remembered Waterloo, the prison and the duchess in love with her young nephew in her middle age, but most of the story that wound them together had faded, so it was almost like finding it for the first time. You can't hold most of what's inside the covers of a novel in your memory for very long after you've finished reading: that isn't accidental or a weakness - it's intrinsic to the novel form and means pleasure can be renewed over and over. Last time I read Emma, I discovered that when Harriet stayed with the Martins, they had their little shepherd boy in to sing to them in the evenings; I'm sure that had never been in the book before. Books read differently on a country holiday; they are more overwhelming, as if they grow to fill the different, emptier air and the lazy living. It's tempting when you're packing up in the city to put in a ridiculous quantity to read, convinced that at last in the country there will be the long, empty hours to do justice to all the books waiting their turn in piles on your floor. Once you're down there, you'll have to make a ritual visit to the secondhand bookshop in a nearby town, where you will find treasures - it's still more satisfying than finding them on AbeBooks - and then there'll be new floor-piles. (You can exult at your treasures over cream tea afterwards.) Once, we found Tibor Dery's Niki: The Story of a Dog (Penguin), a tender allegory of the years of postwar repression in Hungary. In the front was written 'Happy Christmas Peter darling, love from Mummy and Daddy'; we hoped Peter was a sombre child, prepared for bleak initiations (the dog dies). In a country cottage, you probably won't want to read about people cooped up in cottages. It's good to counteract all the seductions of lush nature and noisy, sociable shared meals with something bracing. One of my sons lent me Setting the People Free: The Story of Democracy (Atlantic) by political theorist John Dunn. This is exhilarating and terrifying; it made me see the casual assumptions of our way of politics in a perspective as long and cold as if I was watching from the moon. My reading swoops between the long shot of abstract ideas and the novel's close-up. I have Janet Davey's latest, The Taxi Queue (Vintage), saved up to take down to the cottage this summer. I love her subtle, unexpected sentences. And although her novels are thick with particular right detail - never abstract - there's something of the moon about her writing too, a cool blue light. · Tessa Hadley's Sunstroke and Other Stories is published by Vintage Psychedelia and marshmallows The festival goer By Geoff Dyer What a relief not to be going to Burning Man this summer! To be free of all the planning, schlepping, self-reliance, drugs and dust! Going back year after year was like having a timeshare on a non-existent chalet in the Nevada desert. Relief, of course, does not preclude a swelling sense of elegy, as Byron movingly foresaw: 'So we'll go no more a-raving/ So late into the night,/ Though the heart be still as loved-up,/ And the full moon still as bright.' The strangest thing about Burning Man - or any other festival - is that, in spite of all the things they could be doing, some weirdos still have the time and inclination to read there. How crazy is that? So what should the serious-minded festival goer be seen to be reading this year? Theoretical sustenance comes with Hakim Bey's T.A.Z. (Autonomedia), a visionary manifesto for the festival as a kind of pilgrimage site. The Temporary Autonomous Zone, says Bey, 'is like an uprising which does not engage directly with the state, a guerrilla operation which liberates an area [of land, of time, of imagination] and then dissolves itself to reform elsewhere/elsewhen, before the state can crush it.' (Subject, he might have added, to councils granting licences.) Deep historical context is provided by Barbara Ehrenreich's Dancing in the Streets: A History of Collective Joy (Granta), which also explains why sitting on your boyfriend's shoulders and gazing adoringly at Phil Collins at Glasto - I'm a little out of touch with the music scene - is not the same as being overcome with Fuhrer adoration at a Nuremberg rally. Ehrenreich barely mentions Burning Man - fair enough, she starts way back with the Greek cult of Dionysus - but Daniel Pinchbeck devotes a key chapter to it in his Breaking Open the Head (Flamingo), subtitled in one edition, accurately and grandly, A Psychedelic Journey Into the Heart of Contemporary Shamanism . That's right, he takes all these scary drugs - iboga, DMT, ayahuasca - in snakey places (Gabon, the Amazon) so you don't have to. By the end of it all, either he's gone a little nuts or, as he sees it, the rest of us must be nuts not to spend our time communicating with alien intelligence and machine elves via the DMT hotline (weekend calls are free, terms and conditions apply). Pinchbeck's emphasis on the journey is entirely appropriate. Although it happens in a specific place, a festival offers the opportunity to be transported. Appropriate fiction embraces some kind of spiritual odyssey or self-transforming search. John Haskell's American Purgatorio (Canongate) is one of the best novels of the last five years, a hilarious, profoundly moving road trip that culminates, heartbreakingly, with a marshmallow being roasted on a stick. It is nicely complemented by AM Homes's This Book Will Save Your Life (Granta), another parable - starting where Haskell's ends up, in California - of our time. As both these books were published only a couple of years ago they make Antal Szerb's Journey by Moonlight (Pushkin Press), first published in Hungarian in 1937, even more astonishing. Dude, that's like, hang on... that's 70 years ago! It starts with a honeymoon in Venice and then goes... everywhere. Wherever you get to this summer you will never wind up anywhere as far out as Szerb's delirious narrative: 'We carry within ourselves the direction our lives will take. Within ourselves burn the timeless, fateful stars.' · Geoff Dyer is the author of Yoga for People Who Can't Be Bothered to Do It (Abacus) Travels with Henry, Hector and Hazlitt The cultural flaneur By James Fenton EM Forster used to mock the British tourists solemnly doing the rounds of Florence with their noses in Ruskin. It is years since I have seen a copy of Ruskin's Mornings in Florence (Echo Library), let alone read one, but I remember very vividly its authoritarian tone: one was instructed to look at such a carving and then look at nothing else until one arrived at Ruskin's point of comparison. I tried doing this, and following Ruskin's walks, but Florence had changed since his day and some of the key frescoes Ruskin mentioned were no longer remotely legible. Some writers have set their mark upon the great cities, but whether most people would really want to wander round Rome with a copy of Livy in their back pocket I rather doubt. (Tacitus is another matter.) That kind of holiday resolution which says: 'I have so many days in hand and this time I shall finally conquer Gibbon' sounds more like a vow for a sedentary retreat. And an admirable vow, too, but as a sightseeing tourist, I would want a short book rather than a megalith. If I were walking around Rome and needing something to slip in my pocket to read over lunch, it would be more likely to be Henry James - perhaps Daisy Miller (Penguin). In Venice, it might be James's Letters from Palazzo Barbaro in that truly pocketable volume from the Pushkin Press. But there must be other writers than James for the cultural wanderer or flaneur. As Edmund White notes in his little book about Paris, The Flaneur (Bloomsbury), flanerie is supposed to be purposeless - no good for Americans, who 'are always driven by the urge towards self-improvement'. In White's estimation, Americans are better 'at following books outlining architectural tours of Montparnasse' - rather like those high-minded British tourist in Florence. For those who prefer cities to reveal their treasures more haphazardly, here are three resonant masterpieces, the perfect companions for a loose-limbed stroll. The Memoirs of Hector Berlioz (Everyman) ranges over large parts of Europe and is about artistic aspiration in general, not just the agonies of being a musician. Next, a book that Berlioz loved enough to make an opera out of it, the Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini (Penguin): for a long time, people assumed that a story so engagingly told must be a pack of lies, but where it can be checked it seems largely to be true. And, for the 20th-century artist's life (and the incomparable wealth of gossip they contain), any of the three volumes of John Richardson's Picasso (Cape). 'The rule for travelling abroad is to take our common sense with us and leave our prejudices behind us,' says Hazlitt at the start of his Notes of a Journey Through France and Italy : 'The object of travelling is to see and learn... let us think what we please of what we really find, but prejudge nothing.' There's a philosophy and there's a rare book for a summer afternoon. · James Fenton is editor of The New Faber Book of Love Poems Chilling out with Charles Bukowski and Lord Jim The backpacker By William Sutcliffe Looking back on all the times I went backpacking, and all the hours I spent agonising about what I should cram into my pack, I now realise that my clothes were usually ditched in favour of ethno-tat, my toiletries usually got lost and my medical kit was never opened. Only one thing really mattered: my choice of books. No other activity can approach backpacking for the amount of time spent waiting: for trains to arrive, for buses to leave, for broken-down buses to be mended, all in order to get to some remote spot where you can 'chill out' (i.e. wait). In these circumstances, your choice of reading matter is extremely important. Without a good book, backpacking can resemble an obscure punishment. Novels are the hard currency of a book-bartering economy that thrives in backpackers' hostels all over the world. The books you take have to be not just good, but swappable. The first thing to be aware of is that there is a Backpacker Canon, which is rigid and unchanging. These books have been read by every generation of backpackers since the Sixties and are, for no apparent reason, compulsory. The chief pillars of the canon are Catch-22, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, On the Road and Steppenwolf. These books all fulfil the criterion of changing the way you see the world, often for up to a fortnight. One of these four titles is an obligatory accessory for any self-respecting backpacker. The value of a book in the backpacker barter economy has nothing to do with its cover price. The gold standard of swappability is set by classics of the late 20th century set in backpacker-friendly countries: say, Midnight's Children and One Hundred Years of Solitude. Shortly behind this come novels either about drugs, or by authors who are known to have taken drugs, or which make no less sense when the reader is on drugs. Favourites authors in this category are Hunter S Thompson, Carlos Castaneda, Will Self, Irvine Welsh and Charles Bukowski. It is a mistake to think you have to read about the country you are visiting. Backpackers spend much of their time complaining about the place they have chosen to visit. The job of your reading matter is often to take you away from where you are. I once spent three days on a bus crossing the Gobi desert and, frankly, I needed a book about something other than sand. I read Lord Jim and The World According to Garp and the two books are forever curiously miscegenated in my head. Because of the movie, Robin Williams is somehow in the mix, too. I feel almost as if Williams, Joseph Conrad, John Irving and I spent three days together hanging out on a bus in the desert, with me as host, proud to have introduced them to one another. I hope they keep in touch. You will never have more time to read than when you are backpacking - until you retire - so if you have any sense, you will use it as an opportunity to read books a little longer and more challenging than you are likely to pick up when earning a living intrudes. No trip will ever be entirely wonderful or relentlessly terrible, but if you get back home having read Anna Karenina, Crime and Punishment, A Suitable Boy, Earthly Powers and Underworld, or even just a couple of those, your journey will have been worthwhile. You will have travelled the world in your mind, regardless of where you have been. · William Sutcliffe's latest novel, Whatever Makes You Happy, is published by Bloomsbury, £10.99 The joy of curling up with Casanova The Tuscan villa By Esther Freud Good books, read on holiday in long, daytime stretches, are the ones that often linger most powerfully in one's memory. I will always associate Anna Karenina and the tear-stained pages of my paperback with the white sand of Formentera, as I lay on a beach, forgetting the troubles that had led me there and losing myself in Anna's infinitely greater sorrows. But when I last visited Italy, and was lucky enough to stay in a Tuscan villa, I was researching my novel and didn't dare risk reading any other fiction set there. Instead, I packed The Dark Heart of Italy by Tobias Jones (Faber), described by one of Berlusconi's ministers as: 'a mixture of bigotry and Marxism. Worthy of a country where there's still a branch of the parliament where men wear wigs.' I also took La Terra in Piazza by Alan Dundes and Alessandro Falassi, a book about the Palio - the annual horse race that takes place in Siena - and so dazzlingly passionate about its subject that I had to attend the race myself. But these are both books for flipping through in the cool interiors of luxurious bedrooms, and by the pool I would ideally turn to Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert (Bloomsbury), where she describes how by learning 'the most seductively beautiful language in the world' and attempting to track down the country's best pizza, she rid herself of her depression and gained so much weight she kept the last pair of trousers she bought there as a souvenir. The final story in Jhumpa Lahiri's Unaccustomed Earth (Bloomsbury) is set in Italy, and she uses the beauty of the scenery and the sensuousness of the food to lull you into delusions of romance before breaking not just her character's heart, but yours too. I'd love to lie in the shade and read A Room With a View by EM Forster (Penguin) and reclaim my images from that witty, philosophical novel, since usurped by the gorgeous Merchant Ivory film. If there were many other guests, and the possibility of intrigue, then Nancy Mitford's Pursuit of Love (Penguin) and Dodie Smith's I Capture the Castle (Vintage) are ideal for the romance, the multitude of characters and the reminder that you might be in a large house, but not in a damp, draughty British one. If you like thrillers, there's Niccolò Ammaniti's I'm Not Scared (Canongate), a petrifying novel based on the kidnap in 1978 of a young boy from Milan and the child who befriends and attempts to free him. Just as good may be Elizabeth von Arnim's Enchanted April (Virago), or the lives of Dante, or Casanova. But whatever you take it's important not to risk book envy. I once spent a long weekend beside a pool reading Sebastian Faulks's devastating, claustrophobic Birdsong (Vintage) while my husband devoured What a Carve Up! by Jonathan Coe (Penguin), choking with hilarity at almost every page. · Esther Freud's Love Falls is out now in paperback (Bloomsbury) Top five classic airport novels The Hunt for Red October by Tom Clancy (1984) Cold War thriller much loved by Ronald Reagan, this was the first novel to be published by the US Naval Institute. Hollywood Wives by Jackie Collins (1983) Sex, scandal and lashings of Hollywood gossip, interspersed with envy-inducing shopping sprees on Rodeo Drive. Lace by Shirley Conran (1982) One of the pearls of this gloriously tacky tale of a movie star's search for her roots is the infamous line: 'Which one of you bitches is my mother?' Riders by Jilly Cooper (1985) Show-jumping hero Rupert Campbell-Black set a generation of schoolgirl hearts aflame in vintage Cooper romp. The Firm by John Grisham (1991) Rattling account of the shady goings-on at a Memphis law firm that sealed Grisham's reputation. Might well put you off scuba-diving. Top five summer reads of 2008 The Story of a Marriage by Andrew Sean Greer (Faber) The appearance of a stranger on her doorstep throws a dutiful wife's world off-balance.

And I am a man of cliche. For me, the family is everything. I was born in Venice - but for the last four generations the Da Mostos have taken their brides from elsewhere. My mother is Sicilian. So the blood of all Italy courses through my veins, and this is my story of my travels. Like me, it is small but perfectly formed. Long before the birth of the Most Serene Republic of Venice, a distant ancestor of my family, the nobleman Titus Mustius, was a prominent citizen of Padua, so it was in that direction I headed first in my Alfa Spider to witness the extraordinary genius of Giotto first hand. From there, I pass through Vicenza - was Palladio too good I sometimes wonder - and Verona to stay on the shores of Lake Garda, which enjoys a mild climate. Here I re-read Catullus's rapturous, erotic love poems to his mistress Lesbia. Heading south across the Po, we pass through Bologna and Milan to the hinterland of Liguria. Here my family has another house; it stands on the hill of Sant' Ilario and overlooks the sea. How well I remember waiting until lots of girls were swooning in delight before diving into the sea when I was young! When 20 years ago, wearing military uniform topped with the plumed hat of the Alpine regiment, I made my way to Pisa, I thought about the bloody battle of the Arno. It was sobering to reflect upon the proximity of beauty to tragedy, but for me Tuscany is still essentially a large house in the hills where my cousin, la bella Orsetta, and I were drawn into a tightly woven net as the Angelus bell chimed nearby. Even today I am overwhelmed by Florence, and Siena is still the embodiment of civic pride. But it is Assisi, whose patron saint was named after me, where my soul finds gentle repose. Reluctantly I move south to Rome - la citta eterna, the birthplace of modern history - though traffic remains a perennial problem. In ancient Rome there were 40 varieties of pear tree; today it is easier to find a pizza! Italian history has not always been covered in glory. The Inquisition and the fascist dictatorship of Mussolini were not our finest hours, but I prefer to dwell on the works of Michelangelo and Caravaggio, the music of Puccini and Gesualdo and the musky scent of grapes maturing on a Tuscan vine. The region of Puglia, the \"heel\" of Italy, is a land of castles and horses. Or so my picture book tells me. My more refined sensibilities turn more to Goethe and Alexander the Great, though why this should be I am not entirely sure. Perhaps it is because I am looking up towards Vesuvius from my Neapolitan palazzo. As I cross the turbulent Strait of Messina, within a bowshot of Scylla and Charybdis, I sense I am reaching my journey's end. I make my way up to the ancient amphitheatre of Taormina and gaze out towards the burning fires of Etna, before heading west to Palermo. It was here that my mother, the most beautiful woman who ever lived, was born, and as I walk up the grand double flight of the marble stairs that led to her frescoed salon, I feel her spirit come alive.

Having gained a considerable reputation on record and some prominence in the US, he then began a personal quest that took him to the far east, where he immersed himself in Asiatic folk musics, becoming a pioneer of what is now called New Age and World music. Subsequently Scott based himself in Rome, sometimes turning up in London clubs, standing in the shadows, a tall, Dickensian figure clad in black, unforgettable with his shaved head and wild, full-length white beard. Scott's parents were Sicilians who settled in Morristown, New Jersey, where their son was born. Both were amateur musicians and Scott (originally Sciacca) was encouraged to take his turn at family parties and amateur shows, imitating the Mills Brothers, accompanied by his guitarist brother Nick. He learned to love jazz when his brother played him records by Duke Ellington (with whom Scott worked in 1953) and Count Basie, taking up the clarinet when he was 12. Two years later he formed his first quartet, the Hometown Band, with pianist Bobby Tucker, later Billie Holiday's accompanist. After a year's private tuition from African-American pianist Duke Anderson, Scott enrolled at the prestigious Juilliard School of Music in New York, where he studied clarinet, piano and orchestra composition. While he was there, he formed a big band for which he wrote the arrangements and then studied atonal music at the Contemporary Music School under composer Stefan Wolpe, with whom he later recorded \"free\" improvisations. Initially inspired by Benny Goodman, Scott's absorption in these more experimental music forms prepared him well for the harmonic challenges of bebop. He made his debut at Minton's Playhouse in Harlem in 1939, then the forcing ground for the new music, \"protected\" by tenor-saxophonist Ben Webster, and began to play regularly with innovators like Dizzy Gillespie, drummer Kenny Clarke and guitarist Charlie Christian. \"Ben Webster took me under his wing, he watched over me and became my teacher,\" Scott recalled. Shortly after graduating from Juilliard in 1942, Scott was inducted into the 1st army band at Governor's Island close to New York. He led a variety of bands on the base but was also able to moonlight on 52nd Street, sitting in at every jam session he could, going from club to club, a practice that he pursued throughout his career. After his discharge, Scott played clarinet in small combos and saxophone in big bands, recording with Buddy Rich and Benny Carter, and performing at the Apollo theatre with Lucky Millinder's all-black orchestra. He went on to work and record with virtually all the significant jazz musicians of the day including Gillespie and alto-saxophonist Charlie Parker, likening the rapidity of Parker's playing to \"100 chickens going mad when a fox enters a coop\". His recordings of the time reveal a level of intensity and a degree of loudness well away from that normally expected of the clarinet. This assertive style was probably a reflection of the man himself: the critic Whitney Balliett (obituary, February 5 2007) once charged Scott with \"fervency bordering on desperation\". Although he served as music director for singer Harry Belafonte and accompanied Billie Holiday on record, Scott became disillusioned and felt impelled to look abroad. He began his travels in 1959, expecting to stay away for a year or two, but was absent from America for six years. Never short of work, he recorded often, jammed with the King of Thailand and spent productive time in Japan, while investigating the musical cultures of Indonesia and India. He also began to compose music for zen and yoga meditation before returning briefly to the US, where he again took club engagements. Scott settled in Italy in 1970 and spent the last part of his life in Rome, playing locally and making lightning visits to other countries including the UK where he appeared at Pizza Express in Dean Street (he recorded in London in 1981) and at the occasional festival. He also formed a quartet with pianist Romano Mussolini, the son of Il Duce, making a well-received tour of Italian-American clubs in the US. Scott retained a level of intellectual curiosity that was unusual among jazz musicians. He took jazz to remote parts of the world, made music everywhere, much of it highly distinctive, created photographs and paintings, and left a substantial legacy of recordings. Scott's first two marriages ended in divorce. His third wife Cinzia and daughters Monica Sciacca and Nina Shaka survive him. · Tony Scott (Anthony Joseph Sciacca), musician, photographer and painter, born June 17 1921; died March 28 2007","Id":"news/2007/apr/10/guardianobituaries.musicnews1","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"Obituary: Tony Scott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/apr/10/guardianobituaries.musicnews1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2007/apr/10/guardianobituaries.musicnews1","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":798,"webPublicationDate":"2007-04-09T23:02:53Z","id":"news/2007/apr/10/guardianobituaries.musicnews1","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"The holiday homes you can afford","body":"The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday September 29 2007 The subheading in the Italy section of the following article was inconsistent with the text. It listed Umbria as one of the regions to avoid, but the article recommended Castiglione del Lago (misspelled as Largo) in the province of Perugia, in Umbria. The spelling error has been corrected. After this year's miserable summer the British - already the biggest buyers of second homes in France and Spain - are keener than ever to invest in a dream property overseas. But amid soaring prices, have all the bargains gone`? Guardian Money this week examined the major destinations - Spain, France and Italy - and found that you can still, just about, bag a bargain, but you have to look hard and avoid the usual destinations favoured by Brits. One of the fastest-growing - but now fastest-falling - property markets in the world is Florida, writes Patrick Collinson. The sub-prime mortgage crisis gripping Wall Street and the City has its origins in states such as Florida, where easy lending spurred a house price and building boom that is moving sharply into reverse. But amid the misery of \"foreclosures\" are the first signs of investors buying at rock-bottom prices. We report from Clearwater Beach on the Gulf coast, where prices have tumbled as much as 40%. The pain in Spain is not that different. A glut of developments has pushed prices on the Costas down - but take a short drive from the coast, to the \"pueblos blancos\", and you can still find properties below £100,000. France Many of us will have returned from our summer holiday harbouring dreams of buying our own place in France. But after years of rising prices, finding bargains is harder than ever. Price rise: Last year 15%, Over five years 73% Good value: Champagne-Ardennes, Poitou-Charente, Pyrenees-Atlantiques, Limousin Don't go there: Cote d'Azur, Provence, Dordogne The British love affair with French property shows no signs of abating. Many of us will have returned from our summer holiday harbouring dreams of buying our own place in France. But after years of rising prices, finding bargains is harder than ever. Regions such as Normandy and Brittany have long been popular with Brits, but during the past few years the low-cost flights revolution has dramatically boosted demand for property in other parts of the country. Ryanair now flies to a staggering 20 destinations in France. If you prefer to let the train take the strain, Eurostar is set to become the fastest way to travel from central London to central Paris. The revamped St Pancras station opens for international passengers on November 14, and the company has promised scheduled journey times of two hours and 15 minutes to Gare du Nord. France's property market has been vibrant for a number of years; prices have risen 15% in the past year and by 73% over the past five years, according to recent research from the Halifax. However, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors warns: \"House price behaviour [in France] is quite volatile over the long term.\". However, if you choose wisely, you can still get an awful lot for your money. \"France is still very good value,\" says Liz Oliver at French property specialists Francophiles (francophiles.co.uk), based in Maidstone, Kent. Properties on the coast tend to be expensive, \"but if you are prepared to go inland a little bit, prices drop significantly\". Most buyers tend to be looking to spend between €150,000 (£101,000) and €250,000 (£169,000), says Ms Oliver. Generally speaking, three-bedroom properties start at around €150,000. Needless to say, if you're after something cheap, somewhere like Provence isn't the place to look. \"It's absolutely beautiful but it's expensive. You are unlikely to find a bargain.\" When buying a property in France, you should expect to pay about 6.5% to 8% on top of the purchase price in legal fees. While surveys have suggested that Spain remains the most popular destination overall for overseas second home buyers, France is often close behind, and tends to be particularly popular among the over-40s. Florida The US mortgage crisis has resulted in a huge number of repossessions - and that's attracting the bargain-hunters. Welcome to the world of foreclosure. One in every 80 homes in Florida is currently being repossessed by banks, as the sub-prime mortgage crisis rips through the Sunshine State. While this means misery for evicted home owners, it spells opportunity to others - and many of the buyers are British, taking advantage of the best dollar exchange rates for a decade. At Beloise Realty (belloiserealty.com), owner-manager Sal Beloise is a realtor (estate agent) in Clearwater Beach, which is regarded as one of the best beaches in the US. He says: \"We've just put a property on the market that 22 months ago we got $1.8m (£889,000) for. Even though it's on the bay front, we'll probably end up with a sale price around $1.1m (£544,000). \"At the top end, the properties selling for $2.5m-$2.8m (£1.2m-£1.4m) are now going for $2.1m-$2.2m (£1m-£1.1m), while properties in the interior which had gone for $600,000-$900,000 (£296,000-£445,000) are going for $450,000 (£222,500).\" House prices in holiday centres such as Miami, Orlando and Clearwater boomed in the years running up to 2005, stalled in 2006 and are now falling fast as the foreclosures work through. \"It was bizarre how it came to a halt at the end of 2005,\" says Mr Beloise. \"For the past 23 months it has been like someone flicked a switch and said 'no more sales'.\" Initially Mr Beloise blamed it on overbuilding of condos (apartment blocks) and media reports (he cites CNN) predicting that the boom couldn't last. His guess was that cheap condos bought by investors - those priced around $300,000 (£148,000) - would be hit, but family homes would remain unaffected. But the truth was that every mortgaged household was being affected by a sustained rise in interest rates, which saw the Federal Reserve raise borrowing costs 17 times in succession between 2004 and 2006. \"People who had adjustable [variable] rate mortgages saw their payments doubled or even tripled,\" says Mr Beloise. The financial pain didn't stop there. It is two years since Hurricane Katrina wrecked New Orleans, but its impact still reverberates around the Gulf; home insurance costs have rocketed. A typical household in Clearwater now faces an annual hurricane and flood insurance bill of $4,000 (£2,000), while for waterfront properties the premium can be as high as $10,000 (£4,900) a year. Hard-pressed mortgage payers also face fast-escalating property taxes. Mr Beloise says: \"Taxes are levied on assessment, not on what you paid for the property.\" In his area they are charged at 2% on the value of the home, and after the boom it meant that an owner with a property valued at $1m (£494,000) was having to pay $20,000 (£9,900) a year. \"The number one issue at the last election here was about lowering property taxes, and the next biggest issue was about insurance costs.\" Given the combination of oversupply, stretched affordability, rising interest rates and soaring insurance and property taxes, it is hardly surprising that Florida's property market went into freefall. But what has made this downturn different to others is that the foreclosures are turning up in every neighbourhood, not just in low-income communities. The victims may not like it, but there is now a small industry growing and feasting on the fall in prices. US real estate expert Danielle Babb has just published a book entitled Finding Foreclosure: The Insider's Guide To Cashing In On This Hidden Market. She says: \"In the 'old days' the foreclosures were usually in bad neighbourhoods, sub prime and in bad condition. Today one in every 143 households in America is in foreclosure. This means that a lot of families who took really good care of their homes - even upgraded (especially in Southern Florida) - are now in foreclosure. These are where the bargains are because the neighbourhood value is still strong.\" She adds: \"To get some really good values, your readers need to find home owners in distress - and they can do that by using a site I use to find my own investments called Realtytrac.com. Once they search a zip code, they should look up the pre-foreclosure stage.\" Ms Babb's other recommendation is to seek out distressed home owners before foreclosure. \"If the buyer contacts the home owner directly, they can often work out a bargain deal and then jointly take that deal to the bank - the bank, not wanting to pay a 6% broker [estate agent] fee plus go through the hassles of foreclosure, will often accept the offer if it's reasonable (around 20% to 40% below appraised value).\" A large number of websites have sprung up offering to find foreclosures across the US, although as most charge for access and are keen to find users, some of the claims they make can be far-fetched. The US Mortgage News Daily says recent shocking Realtytrac foreclosure figures, reported across all the major news networks in the US, paint a misleading picture of the \"crisis\". A different reading of the figures suggest arrears and repossession figures are stable in most areas, and would have fallen were it not for sharp rises in just four states. But it acknowledges that one of the states with soaring foreclosures is Florida; the others are Arizona, Nevada and California. In an odd way, the realtors are happy that at least the foreclosures are prompting activity after two years in which sales came to a halt. Joanne Hiller of Island Estates in Clearwater Beach (islandestatesrealty.com) says: \"There are now a lot of properties to choose from and we are starting to see investors come back to the table. We are also seeing some foreign investment; just last weekend I was dealing with British buyers.\" Ms Hiller believes the market in her area bottomed in June, although she's not predicting a rapid recovery across the state. \"Miami was the hardest hit area in Florida, because it built so many condos. It will be the last to recover. Around Clearwater I would say there is excellent value in condos and I think single family homes will come back.\" However, Mr Beloise predicts a bumpy ride ahead. He says the banks are pushing through a lot of \"short sale\" foreclosures, which could depress prices in the short term. \"There's going to be a bumpy time as the foreclosures go through. You are going to see 10-15 foreclosures in one area, and that will affect the neighbourhood. But this isn't going to go on for years.\" Over the longer term, he's confident of a full recovery. \"It really is worth buying here. I've been all round the world and the beach is unparalleled.\" p.collinson@theguardian.com Spain Prices in parts of Spain have begun falling after frenzied development of two-bed \"urbanizacion\" resorts now blighting large parts of the Mediterranean coast. Price rise: Last year 14%, over five years 100% Good value: Non-coastal areas outside the cities of Granada, Cordoba and Jerez Don't go there: Virtually the entire Costa del Sol and Costa Brava Don't be fooled by the \"official\" price rise figure for the past year of 14%. Prices in parts of Spain have begun falling after frenzied development of two-bed \"urbanizacion\" resorts now blighting large parts of the Mediterranean coast. Last year, more houses and flats were built in Spain than in France, Italy and Germany combined - and 600,000 more will be completed this year. The result is a glut that is proving extremely difficult to shift. The price fall comes after years of soaring values in Spain which made even Britain's booming housing market look feeble. Worst hit are the two-bed flats favoured by developers, although agents report price drops of 10%-20% across all classes of property. Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a golden opportunity to pick up property on the cheap. Given the continuing excess supply, some experts are warning that prices will be flat or falling for many years to come. Construction companies on Madrid's stock exchange have collapsed in price and there are fears that those who have bought off plan in future developments could be left high and dry. Another worry is widespread contravention of planning laws, particularly around the Marbella area. As many as 40,000 homes have gone up without proper planning permission, and while some may be granted retrospective permission, others may be bulldozed. In a report earlier this year, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said the Spanish economy has become highly dependent on the residential market and its associated consumer boom. It added: \"Unsurprisingly, a number of pundits are suggesting that 2007 will mark the end of the great Spanish market boom.\" However, its pessimism is limited. \"Acute housing shortages continue, despite all the building; demographic pressures still exist and there remains a seemingly insatiable demand among many Europeans for a place in the Spanish sun. \"Spanish real estate has for many been a source of effortless wealth in re cent years. Perhaps the most worrying thing is that so many people think it is going to stay that way for a long time to come.\" It's not bad news everywhere, though. Mallorca has weathered the storm remarkably well, according to Kyero.com, which runs a Spanish property price index and claims that stories of a widespread crash are \"scaremongering\". But average prices in Mallorca - around euros 430,000 (pounds 291,000) - means the island is now the preserve of the well-heeled. Kyero instead recommends the Canary island of Fuerteventura - average price euros 229,000 (pounds 155,000). Away from the overheated coastal markets, prices are less inflated and less prone to falls. Less developed areas include the Costa de la Luz and Jerez in southern Spain. Don't expect much in the way of capital gain; you need a 20% increase in house prices just to cover the cost of buying and selling. Where? Medina Sidonia, Cadiz province. Why? Medina Sidonia is an unspoilt, white-washed ancient hill-top town in Andalucia with both an Arab and medieval flavour. The village has a slightly shabby grandeur, with narrow cobbled streets leading off an elegant Plaza de Espana. Located just half an hour from Jerez with its cheap flight connections and half an hour from the beaches of the Costa de la Luz. What do you get? One-bed apartments in the old town start at around euros 75,000 (pounds 50,731) while euros 220,000 (pounds 148,811) buys you a three-bed apartment with roof terrace. Casa Cuesta is on offer from andaluzhomes.co.uk for euros 250,000 (pounds 169,097). A four-bed townhouse, it has two bathrooms and two living rooms, plus a 50sq m terrace. Downsides? The village has been \"discovered\" by developers. In the countryside outside, a mega-development of 2,900 homes and attached golf course is under construction. And like other parts of Andalucia, it is unlikely to be totally insulated from the Spanish property market slowdown. Italy Although less popular than France and Spain, Italy has long been favoured by British buyers. Tuscany and Umbria have been joined by a host of new areas - most notably the south. Price rise: One year 4% Good value: Perugia Don't go there: Venice, Tuscany, Umbria and the lakes Although less popular than France and Spain, Italy has long been favoured by British buyers. Tuscany and Umbria have been joined by a host of new areas - most notably the south. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says the overall market rose 4% in 2006 (the second homes market rose 5.5%) \"and it continues to be fairly flat\". Property tends to be kept in the family and sold as a last resort, or when a foreigner makes a crazy offer. The vast majority of Italy is not cheap; if you have less than euros 100,000 (pounds 67,652) to spend you will not find much - unless you are prepared to throw caution to the wind and go for one of the new-builds appearing all over the south. It is now possible to buy a flat in a coastal town for as little as euros 40,000 (pounds 27,059). Steve Emmett, managing director of Brian French Associates, advises caution. \"The opening up of these areas is entirely down to the arrival of Ryanair but you have to wonder what these flats would be worth if the airline pulls out? I'd advise buyers to stick to the well-known areas even if it means buying a smaller house in a better area.\" He suggests one of the best overall packages of value and desirability is the area one hour's drive from Perugia. When pressed he suggested buyrs looks at little-known Castiglione del Lago. Buyers can expect to pay 10%-15% on top of the price in fees and taxes. Where? Castiglione del Largo. Why? A lovely town on the on the banks of Italy's fourth biggest lake Trasimeno - bang in central Italy. Good transport links: a choice of airports in easy reach, including Ryanair into Perugia, excellent local food and wonderful views of the lake. Top location. What do you get? Prices in and around the town start at euros 75,000 (pounds 50,732) - but that is for an inhabitable shack. An option if you are able to do the work yourself, but be prepared for a serious challenge. Reasonable done-up but small ish properties are closer to euros 150,000 (pounds 101,456) - most two and three bed homes are euros 300,000 (pounds 202,911) and above. However, some in the area cost as much as euros 1.1m (pounds 743,995) - and you're only getting three bedrooms. The 75sq m two-bed cottage with garden restored 30 years ago, is in a hamlet near Castiglione and is on the market for euros 115,000 (pounds 77,781) through brianfrench.com. Downsides? Prices, though not rising fast, are still steep. The area can be swamped by weekenders from Rome. At least the pizza and gelati are cheap.","Id":"money/2007/sep/08/moneysupplement.buyingpropertyabroad2","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webTitle":"The holiday homes you can afford","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/sep/08/moneysupplement.buyingpropertyabroad2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2007/sep/08/moneysupplement.buyingpropertyabroad2","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":3000,"webPublicationDate":"2007-09-08T09:26:17Z","id":"money/2007/sep/08/moneysupplement.buyingpropertyabroad2","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"'We can beat anyone now'","body":"If you could distil jubilation into ink and put it on newsprint, you would have the front pages of Wednesday's Italian papers. \"We love you\", cried Corriere della Sport in a headline type taller than the heels of a WAG's sandals. \"Historic Italy - we're in the final\", trumpeted La Repubblica. The Berlusconi family's newspaper, Il Giornale, could not resist making a subliminal political reference with a headline that proclaimed \"Blue triumph\" - blue being the colour, not only of the Italian national side, but also of Silvio Berlusconi's party. Rarely, though, has there been quite such unanimity in Italy's newspapers - or quite so much undiluted admiration. The sages who allot marks for footballing merit are notoriously parsimonious with their points. An eight represents virtual perfection. Yet Corriere dello Sport was happy to award 8.5 to Fabio Grosso, the scorer of Italy's breakthrough goal. La Stampa's columnist, Massimo Gramellini, thought it was all down to national character. \"We're made like that,\" he began. Italy's victory arose from a fraction of a second of inspired insanity on the part of the Palermo midfielder. \"Grosso latched onto a ball that was worth a place in the World Cup final and volleyed it. No one with any sense volleys a ball worth a place in the World Cup final. You need that particular quality that is nurtured, in equal parts, by courage and recklessness,\" Gramellini wrote. But neither he nor anyone else denied this was a team - indeed, a squad - triumph. \"They gave their all,\" wrote La Stampa's match reporter. \"So, at the end, they had it all: the final, the glory, and the world's applause.\" Underlying the joy were feelings of sweet revenge. The British are not the only ones who habitually pick bones with the Germans. The run-up to last night's match was spiced by a running press war that began with an article in Der Spiegel criticising the Italians and ended with calls in Germany for a pizza boycott. \"We're in the final. Us. The pizza chefs. All in a line behind our capitan, Fabio Cannavaro, who comes from the city of pizza,\" wrote Gazzetta dello Sport with malicious delight. Tempting providence, the Rome daily, Il Messaggero, was already certain Italy would win in the final. \"Against whom - France or Portugal - we shall know this evening.

There were several hundred contestants, all battling it out in front of specially installed wood-fired ovens in a sports arena in the city centre. The atmosphere was tense but good-natured and the well-known pizzaioli - those who have won accolades in the past - came out from their prep stations like prizefighters, accompanied by wives, children and friends. As the only foreigner there, I was asked to be a judge and I started off too enthusiastically, scoffing everything in sight. I had to retire after 15 slices and let someone else take my place. There are 12,000 pizzerias in the city of Naples - some 25,000 in the region - and getting it right is a matter of huge pride. A fellow judge told me every self-respecting Neapolitan lifts up the crust of his pizza when it arrives to check that it is properly cooked underneath - not too soft and not 'burned like a biscuit'. Less is more when it comes to a proper, crisp Neapolitan pizza - thin dough with a raised crust, a couple of spoonfuls of pureed tomatoes and a few gently melting splodges of mozzarella. You can also add three or four tiny sliced tomatoes; the best ones are the sweet variety grown near the base of Vesuvius. I met a real Neapolitan idol called Pasquale Parziale, who has been cooking pizzas for 41 years. He has just been named this year's world pizza champion and was one of the judges for the regional event. He talks like Marlon Brando in The Godfather and said something about treating pizza dough like a woman. His recipe for making the perfect base seems easy - water, flour, salt and a little yeast - but I suspect it must take years to master the art. He cooks his pizzas for nine seconds - because he has a fabulous oven - but recommends the maximum cooking time should be four minutes. He flinched when I told him how expensive pizzas are in London and shook his head when I said some people put pineapple on theirs. He cooks at his restaurant in Naples and reckons he has made four million pizzas in his career. 'You can call me maestro,' he said with a grin. Give it up, Silvio, go and have a glass of wine Mayoral elections are being held in Sicily, Rome, Milan, Naples and Turin this weekend and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been running around like a dervish, wooing voters - and, still, insisting he is the victim of electoral fraud. The media tycoon has been attracting huge audiences. In Milan he stated that Romano Prodi's government 'is an illegal occupation that does not reflect the will of the majority of Italians'. In Turin, he roared: 'Go and get in touch with your estranged husbands, ex-wives, past lovers and girlfriends to make sure they vote.' Perhaps it's time for Al Gore to visit Italy and have a word with him over a carafe of red wine. Both men lost elections by slim margins and can justifiably feel hard done by. But while Gore accepted defeat, moved on and reinvented himself as a media star, Berlusconi is still stuck in victimhood. He lost by a tiny margin, but he lost all the same. Someone needs to say to him: 'Silvio, give it up.' Murderer appears in a different court Italian newspapers printed photographs last week of a strikingly attractive, dark-haired woman playing volleyball in bright sunshine and cheering on team-mates. She is Erika de Nardo, 22, convicted in 2001 with her boyfriend, Omar Favaro, of the murder of her mother and her 12-year-old brother. De Nardo and her boyfriend have never explained the killings but some believe that she, at least, was mentally ill - and many people have expressed surprise that she was out on day release after only five years in jail. Her temporary freedom is part of an initiative to let young prisoners mix with outsiders. But the governor of the prison in Brescia, where de Nardo is serving her 16-year sentence, says it is a 'perfect example of how prisoners should be rehabilitated'.","Id":"world/2006/may/28/italy.barbaramcmahon","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Fifteen slices of Neapolitan life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/may/28/italy.barbaramcmahon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2006/may/28/italy.barbaramcmahon","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":725,"webPublicationDate":"2006-05-28T00:53:50Z","id":"world/2006/may/28/italy.barbaramcmahon","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"The people's choice","body":"Try the Queen's patience You may not be aware of this, but the Royal Library at Windsor Castle holds some of the greatest graphic art in the world, including the best collection of Leonardo da Vinci's notes and designs in existence.

Some of these paintings may never go on free public view again. (Christie's, 8 King Street, St James's, London, 020-7839 9060.) Go for a walk in the woods Grizedale Forest Park in Cumbria boasts 90 works of art among miles of conifer woods and spectacular mountain scenery, and landscapes loved by the Romantic art critic John Ruskin. It costs nothing to walk through a living history of modern artistic responses to nature, including works by Andy Goldsworthy and a constantly changing programme of interventions by younger artists. forestry.gov.uk/grizedale When in Rome If you're travelling abroad you will have to pay entrance fees at museums almost everywhere. In Italy you can, however, see great art for nothing, simply by visiting churches. Most of Caravaggio's masterpieces are on permanent view in Rome's baroque churches; the only cash outlay is the coin to operate the lights, which if you're lucky another visitor will pay. Rome itself is a vast free museum with cheap pizza and coffee to sustain you on the long walks between churches and forums. Admire Richard Serra Some of the most renowned recent works of art are public monuments, from Marc Quinn's statue of Alison Lapper in Trafalgar Square to Antony Gormley's Merseyside figures. Yet the best piece of modern art on open view in Britain is often ignored, or mistaken for some rusting metal left by construction workers. Richard Serra's twisting tower of propped slabs of steel outside Liverpool Street Station is a powerful work by the greatest living sculptor, and it's free. (Liverpool Street Station, London, Bishopsgate entrance.) Get invited to openings Exhibitions are expensive but the opening party is free - you just need to get invited and that's not as hard as it might sound. To get an invitation to, say, the preview of the Turner Prize you could always adopt the cheeky strategy of pretending to be a critic - well, there are a lot of art magazines about nowadays - and spend a morning phoning press officers, asking for your name to be put on mailing lists. They'll send you invitations without a second thought, often to events that include free food and drink. Open studios Artists' open studio and open house weeks are now prevalent throughout the UK, from Brighton to Dumfries and Gallaway, offering a chance to view the works of upcoming artists in their studios and even their own homes. At a typical open house you will see the art displayed in an informal setting and be able to buy affordable artworks direct from the artist. Dates vary but entry is always free (and a cup of tea or glass of wine may be thrown in).

Framed by pastel-hued palazzi, recently restored in Pompeiian reds, topaz blues and terracotta oranges, it is the only square in Rome without a church, no mean feat in the home of Catholicism. It is home to one of the oldest fruit, vegetable and flower markets in Rome. The square constantly transforms itself throughout the day. At dawn, carts rattle on the cobblestones on their way to the stalls, laden with tightly packed wooden crates of fruit and vegetables. Later it fills with fruit and vegetable sellers and regular local shoppers, patiently mingling with spellbound tourists. Around midday, the frenzy subsides slightly, as most shoppers return home and the trattorie around the square start putting out tables and chairs to entice punters. At about 2 pm the stalls pack up, the sellers chatting and laughing as they manage to pile huge amounts of empty wooden boxes on to precariously small Ape scooters. Towards six in the evening, as people finish work and spill out on to the streets, the local wine shop, La Vineria, run by the Reggio family, becomes the hotspot of the square. Once the haunt of alcoholic bohemians such as Beat poet Gregory Corso, today La Vineria is where the beautiful, tanned Roman youth hang out with a chilled glass of prosecco to gossip.

The Ghetto and Isola Tiberina The Jewish Ghetto is the area in Rome that most feels like a village. On weekends, especially in spring and summer, as the sun sets and the traffic roar dies down, clusters of locals meet for an early evening chat, perched on the steps or seated at the outdoor tables of one of the cafes. Children roam freely in the pedestrian area, and everybody seems to know each other by their first names. The most lively area is along the Via Portico d'Ottavia, a jam-packed strip full of kosher food shops, pizzerie, bakeries and bars. On the corner is the Pasticceria Boccioni, a bakery that has been churning out Jewish pastries from its cramped premises for 90 years. In the Piazza delle Cinque Scole is Sora Margherita, a tiny restaurant with no outdoor sign. Since 1927, it has been serving a plate and a glass of Velletri wine to the popolino, the working class of the city. Cook Lucia, who used to work with Margherita, now runs the kitchen, serving classics such as pasta and ceci (chickpea and pasta soup), baccalà in guazzetto (salt cod in a sauce of tomatoes, pine nuts and raisins) and Roman-style tripe. Just underneath the portico is the Gigetto restaurant, a Roman institution since the 1920s and famed -regardless of its Catholic owners - for the carciofi alla giudia, or Jewish-style artichoke hearts. Next door to Gigetto, his parents' restaurant, Stefano Ceccarelli runs Dolce Roma, a patisserie that combines traditional Jewish sweets such as ricotta and cherry cheesecake with rich American- and Austrian-style pastries including Sachertorte, and muffins.

Prati and Borgo Pio The fortified Castel Sant'Angelo, originally Hadrian's Mausoleum, marks the beginning of the Borgo Pio and Prati area. The small village of Borgo Pio sprung up in AD 500, next to the Vatican just underneath the Leonina walls, hence the name Leonina city. In AD 800, Pope Leo III consolidated the walls against the Saracens and, when Borgo was burnt down in 846, Pope Leo IV rebuilt it like a fortified district. For centuries, Borgo Pio was considered an area under papal protection. It was only in 1861, when Italy was unified into a state, that the inhabitants of Borgo Pio voted to be annexed to the Kingdom of Italy. Today Borgo Pio still has the slow pace of a small borough, separated from the hustle and bustle of Rome's daily life. Its cobblestone streets are pedestrianised, and the medieval palazzi, covered in vine trellises and bougainvillea make way for squares filled with the outdoor tables of local restaurants. Beyond Borgo lies Prati, a wealthy suburb, built after the unification and characterised by a rational grid of housing blocks. Today, the area is largely populated by the Roman bourgeoisie and people working in the nearby studios of Italy's state-run TV and radio stations. A typical Prati custom is to meet at chic bars Antonini or Vanni to sample the tartine, tiny, freshly made bread buns filled with caviar, smoked salmon or crab. A dash of lemon juice is all that is needed before gulping down the delicacy, which is often served with an aperitif.

Mercato Trionfale A huge fruit, veg and fish market - with good prices and excellent quality. · Via A Doria. Trastevere Trastevere, which lies across the river Tiber from the old centre, is another quintessentially Roman area. The residents call themselves the Romani di Roma, the \"real Romans\", and even though the area is now swamped by tourists and foreigners who have chosen to live there, it retains an unmistakable and authentic essence. There is a leisurely pace to Trastevere: the vicoli (narrow roads) are covered with vine trellises or bougainvillea, and sprinkled with rows of laundry hanging from windows. The Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere, with its 12th-century Byzantine- style mosaic facade, is the centrepiece of local life. Trastevere was home to the celebrated poets, Giuseppe Gioacchino Belli (1791-1863) and Trilussa (Carlo Alberto Salustri, 1871-1950). Both wrote poems in the romanesco dialect; eating and joviality were often their prime subjects. Many restaurants and bars here bear the names of these famous sons, as if to certify the traditional authenticity of their fare. Along with Campo dei Fiori, Trastevere is the rione (quarter) that boasts the most restaurants, pizzerie and bars. In fact, for many Romans, Trastevere is largely a place to go to eat for the evening with your friends. During the summer, the city decamps to the district for the Festa di Noantri, a festival that extends for eight days during July. Noantri means \"us\" - in contrast to voiatri, Romans from elsewhere - reinforcing the trasteverini notion of being veraci (authentic). During Noantri, traffic comes to a standstill, with Romans queuing up at stall vendors for roasted nuts, candy, toys, watermelon slices and grattachecca, Rome's very own granita. Ferrara Top-notch restaurant with a huge variety of wines located in a converted convent. The small bar at the front also offers aperitivi with lots of snacks. · Via del Moro 1/a, +06 583 33920.

Testaccio Just across the southern end of the river Tiber, in front of the classy neighbourhood of the Aventine hill, lies Testaccio, a lively, working-class area full of clubs, restaurants, food stores and one of the noisiest food markets in the city. Those who know Testaccio will tell you that by day it hasn't changed much. The covered fruit and vegetable market is still much cheaper than Campo dei Fiori, and its layout is less pretentious and pretty. Yet it is by night that Testaccio succumbs to the invasion of the modern era, with a maze of clubs, restaurants and bars in and around the grottoes of the Monte dei Cocci, now known as \"Testaccio village\". Even if the influx of writers, actors and students has changed the scene, Testaccio still manages to cling to its proletarian roots. A working-class culture was defined when Testaccio became the setting for the municipal slaughterhouse in 1890. The slaughterhouse came to define the cuisine of Testaccio, which is not for the fainthearted, let alone vegetarians. The spiritual home of Roman meat eaters, Testaccio's restaurants specialise in succulent dishes, the ingredients of which read like the anatomy of a cow. Near the market is Felice a Testaccio, a typical trattoria run by the mercurial 83-year-old Felice. Adored by Oscar-winning actor Roberto Benigni, who once wrote a poem in his honour, Felice has built an establishment that is celebrated as the place to taste succulent suckling lamb, known as abbacchio in Rome. Beware, however, of his mood swings, and remember to eat all the contents of your dish - otherwise Felice might well decide you are not worthy of a second course.

Politicians expressed dismay at the ease with which the wanted man, Hussein Osman (or Hamdi Isaac, as he is also believed to be called), had been able to leave the country. Muktar Said-Ibrahim, the suspected ringleader of the July 21 bombings, was seen in Rome several weeks before the failed attack, two witnesses told the Guardian yesterday. A mother and daughter living downstairs from the flat in a Rome suburb where Osman and his brother were arrested on Friday said they had recognised Ibrahim from television footage. Italian investigators arrested a second brother of Osman yesterday. Osman, whose court-appointed lawyer said he would fight an extradition request from Britain, travelled from London to Rome via Milan and Bologna at the end of last week. His progress across Europe was traced by calls he made from a mobile phone. Among possible links being examined are whether Osman phoned Saudi Arabia. According to reports, Osman has admitted taking part in the failed attacks. His lawyer, Antonietta Sonnessa, was quoted as saying he had not intended there to be casualties. \"He did not want to kill anyone, but merely to carry out an attention-grabbing act,\" she told Italy's Ansa news agency. She added later: \"He is not at all a violent person, and made sure he would not cause any damage, injuries or deaths.\" That was disputed last night by Scotland Yard, which insisted the devices had been set to explode. Ms Sonnessa went on: \"He had it only in mind to create further tension in an already tense situation.\" Osman was also reported as saying: \"Religion had nothing to do with it. We were shown videos of the Iraq war and told we must do something big.\" An Italian legal source said last night that there was a very real prospect of Britain's extradition request for Osman being thwarted. Prosecutors have formally asked to investigate him on suspicion of international terrorism. If their request is upheld at a hearing expected to be held in Rome today, then Osman would need to be kept in Italy while the investigation was completed. This alone could take a year, the sources said. But if he were to be tried and eventually imprisoned, it could be several years before Italy was ready to hand him over to Britain. Yesterday's arrest came after the Italian interior minister, Giuseppe Pisanu, warned that Osman had been able to rely on a \"dense network\" of support in Italy. Police identified the latest detainee as Fati Isaac, Osman's brother. He was formally arrested in the northern city of Brescia after a lengthy interrogation which began on Saturday. Police said he had been accused of hiding or destroying documents, but his girlfriend, Elvisa Falyc, claimed they were just a missing passport and birth certificate. A second brother, named as Remzi Isaac, was arrested on Friday, accused of forging documents. Officials said Osman had lived in Italy during the 1990s and spoke good Italian. The witnesses interviewed by the Guardian said they had seen him several times at the housing estate where his brother Remzi lived. The mother witness said she had seen Osman in early July: \"We'd gone out for a pizza and were coming back at around 10.30 when I saw him with the other one, the one they arrested in London [Ibrahim]. They were speaking English. At least, they were speaking in a foreign language. I think it was English.\" La Repubblica newspaper reported that, during his interrogation, Osman said Ibrahim had taught him to assemble bombs. But it quoted him as saying: \"Muktar urged us to be careful. We didn't want to kill, just to spread terror.\" In Brighton, police arrested seven more people, six men and a woman, at two addresses, bringing the total of those now in custody to 19. The July 21 suspects were all being interviewed yesterday. It has been suggested that one of the men is cooperating with the police. While there is no specific intelligence of a \"third cell\" or plans for a fresh attack, police and intelligence sources are acutely aware that another attack may be planned. Police also say they are aware that the bombers could come from any ethnic group, and that a white convert could offer his or her services. One police source said: \"If you go to a mosque you will see people from every different ethnic background.\" Thousands of police will continue to patrol the London transport system in operations similar to that mounted last Thursday. Had there not been a big operation then and something had happened, said a police source, the force would have been severely criticised. Stop-and-search operations continued in the capital yesterday. The Home Office minister Hazel Blears defended the policy in the wake of comments by the head of British Transport police, Ian Johnston, that \"we should not waste time searching old white ladies\". The deputy chief constable of the transport police, Andy Trotter, said yesterday that the stop-and-search operations had been \"intelligence-led\", particularly last Thursday when the four suspects were still at large. \"The searches will continue to be intelligence-led, and we are conscious of the fact that groups around the world have used women and children and people of many different ethnic backgrounds to carry out attacks,\" he said. Police and politicians expressed concern at the apparent ease with which Osman had left the country. The leader of the Commons, Geoff Hoon, said yesterday that he understood the concern and that the Home Office was investigating. A Home Office spokesman said special passport checks had been introduced by the immigration service on July 7, at the request of the Metropolitan police, at all UK ports of embarkation. This should have included Waterloo station, the departure point for the Eurostar trains. The checks were lifted on July 17, but were put back in place after the failed suicide bomb attempts of July 21.","Id":"uk/2005/aug/01/italy.july71","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"Second bomb suspect was seen in Rome","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/aug/01/italy.july71","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2005/aug/01/italy.july71","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":1009,"webPublicationDate":"2005-08-01T00:13:22Z","id":"uk/2005/aug/01/italy.july71","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Novak & Ana","body":"Novak Djokovic Men's tennis in 2007 was all about one man: Novak Djokovic. At the start of the season, he was 19 years old and ranked 16th in the world. By the time he left Wimbledon - stymied in the semis by foot blisters - he was number three. But the moment that defined his stellar year was not, surprisingly, a win. It was his appearance in the US Open final, against Roger Federer, in September. Djokovic may have lost the match, but the sight of Maria Sharapova screaming him on from his guest box - with Robert De Niro alongside - confirmed he had something that Federer, whatever blazer-and-trouser combos he may concoct, will never be able to emulate: style. For a sense of Djokovic's flair, you could watch his Wimbledon quarter-final against Marcos Baghdatis, one of the most thrilling matches of the year, despite being five hours long, or the attacking play that defeated Federer in the final of the Montreal Masters in August. But that is only half the story. For the rest, see Djokovic's YouTube moments: his full-throated karaoke rendition of 'I Will Survive' at the French Open; his on-court impersonations of his fellow players, from a crotch-fiddling Nadal to a prancing Sharapova. Djokovic has charm and, crucially, wit, and has taken it upon himself to be Serbia's most winning, and most committed, ambassador to the world. In his family's Belgrade office, in one of the city's ubiquitous concrete blocks, the young man who is the family business offers drinks with the kind of manners that would please your mum. I put it to Novak Djokovic that with his sporting ability, the four languages he speaks and the Monte Carlo second home, not to mention last year's $3.9m (£1.9m) prize money, he has to be the most eligible bachelor in Serbia right now. He laughs. There have, it transpires, been a few phone calls from hopeful mothers. 'Yes, that's one of the things that's happening now,' he says with a smile. 'But it's just part of the success. I'm happy, my family's happy, everything is going well.' The evidence is around us. Djokovic's schedule for his three-day home visit is full of public appearances and private meetings, and the office is bustling. Uncles and cousins come and go, finalising arrangements for a charity event at the Belgrade Arena - one of the largest indoor stadiums in Europe - under the direction of Novak's dad Srdjan. Novak will be playing a doubles exhibition match with Ana Ivanovic, Jelena Jankovic and Janko Tipsarevic who have, in barely a year, effected nothing less than a revolution in Serbian sport. Until their recent successes, tennis ranked lower on the sporting consciousness here than volleyball, handball and water polo. Now it is challenging football and basketball as the country's most popular sport. Since the French Open, the tennis federation has seen a 40 per cent increase in people playing the sport and basketball courts are being hijacked by children wanting to hit balls over an imaginary net. 'Football has always been big here, even though we never achieved anything,' says Djokovic, who is a big fan of Red Star, the 1991 European champions. 'I love football and it's the sport I would really like to play. I've said on national television here that I would really love to play for one of our football clubs when I finished my tennis career. Everybody was surprised, but that's what I really want to do. When I finish, who knows? A couple of games, or half a season.' Is he any good? 'Yeah!' What kind of player? 'Attacking. I like to score.' This makes sense: given his propensity to strip off his shirt for tennis fans, he would particularly enjoy the celebrations. Anyway, who has the best body in the men's dressing room? He pauses to consider this quite seriously. 'Oh. Whooh. I would say, for sure, Paradorn Srichaphan. He has not been playing and I haven't seen him for a while. But he still has the best body in men's tennis.' Better than Rafa? 'Rafa? No, no... I don't like bodies like Rafa's.' I ask if he has any bad habits. 'Breathing,' he replies. Er, right. 'It's something that's bothering me a bit. I still don't have the right breathing on the court, exhaling when you're hitting the ball. You lose a lot of energy if you're not breathing right. Maybe some yoga would help.' In 2005 he had an operation to fix what he calls a 'deviation' in his nose. Sounds weird. 'Yeah, it was! It was the worst time in my life. I was in the hospital and for three days I couldn't breathe because I had things in my nose, it was terrible. But the surgeon was from Italy and he knows how to do the job really well. He did nose surgery with Paolo Maldini and even Prime Minister Berlusconi. So he's pretty famous there.' Those are some important noses. Did he offer any, you know, shaping? 'Aesthetic wise? No, that was something they didn't offer.' More than a hundred journalists turn up to Novak's morning press conference. With his white shirt tucked in to a pair of jeans, rimless glasses and his earnest responses, he has the air not so much of a sportsman as of a PhD student, or an accountant. Alongside him sit his two younger brothers, teenager Marko and 12-year-old Djordje, both promising players. Marko's shy, but little Djordje is not. When someone asks him who his tennis idols are, he replies: 'I like players from the past like Andre Agassi. But I like myself the best.' Djokovic's own hero was, and remains, Pete Sampras, because, aged six, it was Sampras he watched win Wimbledon in 1993, jump- starting his love of the game. It is hard to imagine in what way punctilious Pete might have inspired such an extrovert. Djokovic laughs. 'We're totally opposite. Totally opposite personalities. Totally opposite game. But I just love the way he deals with the pressure. He always plays well, always serves well in the important moments. Mentally he was the strongest person I've ever seen. I'm just really sad that I still haven't had the chance to meet him. Maybe in the upcoming season in the States I will.' What will he say when he finally does meet him? 'I don't know... I'll probably say nothing for 10 minutes, I'll be so confused. Then I'll say, \"Let's play!\"' One player he has befriended - ever since they began competing - is Andy Murray. You suspect they would make a pretty wild duo. 'Well, we haven't partied too much,' says Djokovic, looking almost demure. 'But on the court you can see how we're both playing with a lot of emotion. He screams a lot, and I throw rackets.' The pair have always been closely compared in ability and potential; but over the past year, while Djokovic has been fulfilling his, Murray has been left nursing injuries and kicking the sofa. Does that make things awkward between them? Novak looks momentarily sheepish. 'Actually, I lost his number.' Perhaps he has the gossip on what is happening between Jelena and Andy's brother Jamie, who looked so cosy at last year's Wimbledon? He grins. 'No. But as soon as I see Jelena today I'm going to ask her what's going on. I heard she was denying everything, but I think I saw them at the US Open together, so I don't know.' And speaking of these things, what is the deal with him and Sharapova? 'There is no deal,' he says, though he is clearly not offended at the question. 'Obviously when you see her sitting there in the final of the US Open cheering for me you think, \"What's going on?\" But it's just a nice friendship.' By 5pm, Djokovic has changed into a velvety brown suit, far more befitting his sex-symbol status, for Serbia's sports personality of the year awards, held at one of Belgrade's slightly shabbier hotels. Apart from a wrestler, a drag racer and a kayaking quartet, Djokovic's only real competition for the title comes from Jankovic and Ivanovic. At the buffet that follows her son's inevitable victory, his mum, Dijana, talks about the tennis academy that the family is hoping to establish in his name. 'The important thing is that the idols for young Serbs now are very good kids,' she says. 'They are people who really worked hard to get where they are now. They didn't steal, cheat, or kill somebody to get there. For 10 years it was so bad. The role models were gangsters, or drug dealers. Everything is changing.' Afterwards, the Djokovic family head for dinner with one of their own idols - Alberto Tomba, aka Tomba la Bomba, the legendary Italian skier and multiple world champion. Djokovic's father Srdjan was a skier for the former Yugoslavia, and his parents met on the piste; throughout Novak's childhood they ran a pizza-and-pancakes restaurant in the ski-resort town of Kapaonik. While most professional sportspeople shun the slopes - because neither their coaches nor their insurance companies like it - Novak still skis whenever he can. So which is he: speed or style? 'I like to think it's a combination of both,' he says. 'But I try to have more style. I like to look nice on the skis.' That Djokovic became a tennis player at all is something of a curiosity. As well as inheriting skiing genes from his father, his mother's family contained some serious volleyballing talent. 'Nobody actually played tennis in my family,' he says. But as he watched four tennis courts being built opposite the family restaurant, the five-year-old Djokovic was enthralled. Jelena Gencic, who opened the tennis camp there, is still coaching in her seventies; Djokovic often describes her as the biggest tennis influence in his life. Gencic remembers the day he first arrived to play. 'He arrived half an hour early with a big tennis bag,' she says. 'Inside his bag I saw a tennis racket, towel, bottle of water, banana, wrist-bands, everything you need for a game. I asked him, \"Who packed your bag, your mother?\" He said, \"No, I packed it.\" He was only five. I said: \"How did you know what to pack?\" And he said, \"I watch TV.\"' His mum Dijana says that even as a young boy he was a perfectionist. 'I always tried to win,' Djokovic agrees. 'I was as competitive as I am today.' It was his tennis routine that saw the family through during the Nato bombing campaign in 1999. 'All our family were here in Belgrade during the bombing, and all day we were on court,' Dijana says. 'And this is what saved us. It wasn't any more or less safe than any other place in the street, but if you're sitting at home in the basement, thinking they are going to bomb your home, you're going crazy. It's not good. We were practising all day, and at seven o'clock we would go home and sit with the curtains closed, everything closed and dark the way it had to be.' Sponsors weren't interested in a young Serb, even when he won junior European titles, so Djokovic's parents had to rely on their extended family for help. Perhaps that partly explains why Djokovic is so keen to be an ambassador for his homeland. 'He always feels he needs to act diplomatically,' says his coach, Marian Vajda. 'He loves his country.' And yet, ironically, his popularity has become so overpowering that he has to train abroad. 'Even to come to see his family is hard,' Vajda says. 'He gets so bothered. Last time we had a practice in Belgrade we had 20 people on the court, so I said no more. It's better for him to practise somewhere else. But of course he misses it so much.' Belgrade Arena holds 20,000 people. Tonight, every seat is filled, and every person present - little boy, teenage girl, adult male - seems to have a fairly open crush on 'Nole', as they call him here. The other participants in the celebrity doubles match, Tipsarevic, Ivanovic and Jankovic, are announced to loud cheers. When Djokovic appears, however, the cheers turn to hysterical screams. Grown men hurl themselves down the stadium steps to get closer. The four greet one another as the old friends they are; Djokovic, living up to his heart-throb role, offers Ana an elaborate bow that ends on bended knee. The crowd loves it. Although they played at different clubs, Djokovic has practised and played with Ivanovic since they were five years old. 'She's a fantastic girl,' he has told me earlier, 'one of the nicest I've ever met. She has such a great personality, very calm and very positive. And she's beautiful as well! She has a beautiful smile. She's attracting people wherever she goes because she's very bright and people recognise it and respect her.' Has she ever taken a game off you? 'No!' Then: 'I'm joking. Of course she has. But I could never play with her 100 per cent serious because I laugh with her more than anyone else. I really enjoy practising with her.' Who's better, Ana or Jelena? Djokovic is too gentlemanly to be drawn. 'I just say... I don't know! I wouldn't, because they're both playing great tennis.' The exhibition match is only one set long, much of it a showcase for his on-court silliness and, of course, impersonations. At the end of the evening, Djokovic and Tipsarevic join the band to sing a popular, though puzzling, song about friendship (sample lyrics: 'I myself am a migratory bird'). Djokovic's voice is not what you would call tuneful, but right now he could release a recording of his tooth-brushing routine and still have a number-one hit. Maybe one day, he says, he could be a singer, or an actor. 'Or who knows what,' he says. 'I'm really enjoying my time.' Interview by Emma John Ana Ivanovic Taking an early evening constitutional along the western shore of Lake Zurich, Serbian tennis star Ana Ivanovic is talking, 19 to the dozen, about the curious world she inhabits. Even the swans turn their heads the better to catch this 6ft 1in peach-skinned girl as she walks, and talks, and sips her large Starbucks takeaway. Then talks some more. She is wearing skinny jeans, a bitter-chocolate leather jacket and a cream silk scarf. In conversation, as on court, she covers a lot of ground quickly. No sooner has she dispatched the subject of Robbie Williams than she is happily lobbing George Clooney into the conversation and skilfully volleying the topic of Slobodan Milosevic back over the net. As we head up Zurich's old cobbled streets, she is talking about travel, which, as a professional tennis player, takes up 90 per cent of her time. 'I live in a suitcase,' she says, but you know what she means. Ivanovic reels off the matches played and the countries visited in the past year alone, and you cannot begin to calculate the air miles and the WTA kudos she has accumulated. There was the Australian Open (she reached the third round), French Open (she lost the final to Justine Henin), Wimbledon (memorably beaten in the semis by Venus Williams) and the US Open (knocked out, fourth round, that Williams woman again). Meanwhile, without so much as a sip of barley water, she was also off to the Tier I events. 'Tokyo, Miami, Berlin, Rome, San Diego, Toronto, Moscow,' she says in a resigned sing-song. By the time we have meandered back towards Starbucks (she needs refuelling), it has been made plain that no matter how moneyed, mollycoddled and media-massaged these tennis princesses may be, most of them put in more court appearances per year than Pete Doherty. Does your personality change once you're on court? I'm more aggressive. It has to happen because if you're too soft you're going to lose. I'm very easy-going off court, but I really want to win once I'm walking on to the court. At that moment, do you hate your opponent? I try not to think about the person, just their tactics, their weaknesses and strengths. I play against the ball. It doesn't really matter who you're playing at that point. Even if you're facing one of the Williams sisters? That's a little harder. They play very aggressively. Are you a bad loser? Very bad. Even if I play backgammon with my coach I hate to lose. I won't talk to him for, like, an hour. So imagine how it feels when you lose at tennis. That makes me determined not to lose because I hate it so much. Even at a set down and match point I always believe I can come back. But sometimes you must know it won't happen... Sometimes. In Australia against [Vera] Zvonareva, I was 6-2, 5-1 and 40-0 down and I was thinking: 'Nothing's going my way today.' And when you're having a bad day, there are normally a lot of people watching, so it's sort of embarrassing. What do you do half an hour before a big match? I like to be alone and listen to music. Every match I play, I have a tune in my head over and over. It might only be a few words or a small piece of the tune, but it can drive you mad. Can your mind drift during matches? It's not always possible to concentrate completely, so you'll find yourself thinking about something someone said earlier. That's when you have to pinch yourself and get back to what's happening on the court. Have you ever cheated? No. Actually, I did once. I was a junior and there was no referee and I played against this Russian girl and she cheated so badly. She was calling balls out that were a metre inside the line. I was so angry, I thought: 'Every time she cheats, I'm going to cheat her back.' So I did. Earlier this afternoon, Ivanovic made a fleeting appearance on the sports floor of an upmarket (this is Switzerland, they don't do downmarket) department store. As a resident of Basel, she is treated as a local in Zurich. Her approachability is appreciated and fans cluster around as she dispenses multilingual goodwill and free Adidas T-shirts. Ivanovic's sponsorship deal with the sportswear giant was engineered - like her entire career - by her manager, Dan Holzmann, a Swiss-based German entrepreneur, who took on Ana when she was 14. He needed only two hours before deciding to invest the half a million dollars it would take to groom the naturally gifted girl. Within 18 months of her 2003 pro debut, Ivanovic had paid this seed money back. Holzmann continues to negotiate shrewdly - with Adidas, Wilson, Aqua Viva and Verano Motors - on his charge's behalf. With her global marketability and his business acumen, they make an enviably winning team. Having remained unmolested for the duration of her lakeside date, Ivanovic is spotted by a few youths. They blush and jostle and, much like your reporter, ask her random questions that she claims to enjoy more than talking tennis tactics. 'Get it over the net and between the lines,' she says of her complex technical game. 'At the end of the day it's really that simple.' Do you remember the war starting in Serbia? No, I was too young, but I remember the bombing in 1999 [by Nato, during the Kosovo War]. That was something I'll never forget - the biggest shock of my life. My parents tried to keep it away from us, they wouldn't talk about it or put the news on. But schools were shut, nobody went to work, everything stopped. It was a bit scary, but people really stayed together and protected each other. Describe your bedroom as a child. When I was very young I shared my bedroom with my brother. He's four years younger than me. Later we had separate rooms. Mine was apricot-coloured - nice, eh? I was so happy because I had a TV in my room. I wasn't crazy about putting posters up of movies stars or singers. I only really loved Monica Seles - I so was obsessed. Your parents must have found your tennis obsession strange... Yes, firstly because I was such a clumsy kid. I couldn't run without knocking something over. Then I wanted to play tennis and no one in my family knew anything about tennis. Looking back, I really don't know what attracted me to it, but I still have a video of my first-ever practice, when I was five. Watching it now, there was a little bit of talent there; I could hit the ball. Do you feel that you missed out on a normal teenage life? Not really - I never liked going out to parties. Partying and drinking were never my thing. Do you cry easily? I'm quite an emotional person. I cry a lot. I do not like conflict, so if I have an argument with my parents I'll often cry. I become too emotional. I cried after I lost in the Stuttgart Open. Another bad day for me and she [Tatiana Golovin] played better than me. But there'll be plenty more opportunities. The world's fourth-ranked woman tennis player insists on buying and fetching the foamy mugs of ubiquity from the Starbucks counter. 'I just love these places,' she says without a hint of irony, and if you were 20 years old and had gone from war-torn Serbia to itinerant tennis ace, you might feel the same. Ivanovic is a wealthy woman these days - she won more than $3m (£1.5m) in 2007 alone. She wears Armani Code perfume, goes on regular frock-shopping raids with her lawyer mother (dad, handily, is an economist) and invests her sponsorship millions on the advice of top European businessmen. Tall, beautiful, talented, minted. That's it, she's getting the next coffee, too... Your website is among the most-visited of any female athlete. Which do you visit most often? I shouldn't say Lime Wire [a music-sharing site], should I? I go to iTunes! And YouTube is always interesting. You can find anything on YouTube. Who, to your mind, is the most attractive woman on the tennis circuit? [Laughs] It's hard to say for a girl but... [Maria] Kirilenko. She's quite attractive. Are women attracted to you? Oh my God, I've had a few uncomfortable experiences but I'm so allergic to that. I just can't... even now when I see my friends and they just want to kiss the cheek. I prefer men. Do you prefer men to be philosophical or funny? I like men who are thoughtful, but overall I would prefer them to be funny. Here's a funny but slightly philosophical joke: no matter how good you get at tennis, you'll never be better than a wall. A war? Oh, a wall. Yes, that's funny. Could you ever date a short man? I know you should say it's about the person inside, but probably not. I'm tall and it's too difficult. Why don't you just marry Novak Djokovic and have unbeatable tennis babies? [Laughs] We're still so young. We're both just 20. We have many more years in front of us yet. Are all Serbians good-looking? As a people, Serbians are very tall, and we have olive skin and dark hair, which can look very nice. You have to be very beautiful to stand out. Would you ever play tennis drunk for fun? No, I've never done anything drunk. I'm an in-control person. I was tipsy a few times but I can't drink. I told you, I'm a real party-pooper. Can what you wear affect your game? It really can. You'll be wearing a dress you don't feel comfortable in or you'll think: 'These shorts keep coming down all the time!' You lose focus if you think your shorts are falling down. Are you able to jump the net? No, I'm not. I should learn. You may need to do that at Wimbledon this year. Is there anything you wouldn't do in order to win Wimbledon? Oh, I'd do so much that you can't imagine - as long as it wasn't really bad. Sell your soul? No, I need that. Your grandparents? I love, love, love my grandparents. Eat a dog? Eat a dog?! No, nothing that crazy. And I wouldn't do something like jump in the Thames naked. I'm just not that type of person. But you probably understand that by now. A church bell sounds six. It comes from an elegant clocktower with a wide, round face. Standing beneath the steeple, like its human embodiment, Ana Ivanovic watches the young couples drift by in the fading sunlight. 'I'll have a family and live in my own home one day,' she says without emotion. 'But that's for the future.'

Right Said Fred were too sexy for their shirts and the Soviet Union was collapsing. I don't think the two were connected. Wearing flowery shorts and a cheap purple rucksack, I boarded a train at Victoria station with two friends. I don't remember much about that train journey. But I do remember the sense of giddy excitement I felt. We had four weeks, a money belt stuffed full of travellers' cheques and a rail pass that would take us almost anywhere in Europe. Before gap years in Thailand or Australia became the norm, InterRailing was the student rite of passage. It seems tame now, but for Jenny, Steph and me, just graduated from Leeds University, this trip marked the end of a chapter, one last hurrah before returning home to the serious business of Getting A Job. Over the following days, we tore south through France and Italy, managing to miss the major attractions of pretty much every city we visited. We went to Paris and didn't visit the Louvre or the Eiffel Tower, we went to Rome and didn't see the Sistine Chapel, we went to Florence and queued for the Uffizi gallery, but didn't go in. We lived on a diet of croissants, bread, cheese and beer, occasionally treating ourselves to a pizza (this was in the days before Gillian McKeith had been invented). We slept in shared dormitories in grotty youth hostels or on overnight trains. We snogged pretty young boys and were groped by dirty old men. We spent a long, cold night shivering on the deck of an overnight ferry from Italy to Athens and lost ourselves in the Greek islands for two weeks. In Santorini Jenny met Dan, the man she would later marry, and in Paros I met an Italian dental student called Walter, whom I would not later marry. By the time we hit Eastern Europe it all becomes a bit fuzzy. I have photographs of me in Budapest but I have no recollection of actually being there. In Vienna, I have a feeling we didn't even get off the train. Broke and exhausted, dirty and malnourished, we decided to skip Germany altogether and came home five days early. It was a blast. Sixteen years later and nobody could be more surprised than I am to find myself in WH Smith, studying the Thomas Cook European Rail Timetable. In recognition of the fact that the horizons of the average student have widened far beyond the borders of the European Union, Rail Europe has started selling first-class InterRail passes for adults. In a further attempt to woo back the original generation of InterRailers, the passes are also now available in much shorter durations, starting from as little as three days. I call up Steph. 'Want to go InterRailing?' There's a stunned silence. 'But not like before,' I add, hastily. 'It will be posh InterRailing: first-class travel, nice hotels, we'll sleep in real beds and we'll eat proper food in restaurants and, who knows, maybe even see some sights?' But that's not the only way in which this journey will be different. For a start, Jenny has just had a baby so she won't be coming. And work commitments mean we'll have to condense the trip into a week. After some discussion, we decide to focus on Italy, scene of some of the biggest highs - and lows - of our first trip. The next decision is whether or not to book hotels in advance. By booking ahead, we save on the time and hassle of looking for places to stay when we get there, but we also lose the freedom to change our plans at the last minute, which is one of the great joys of this type of travel. For the first but certainly not the last time on this trip, being sensible wins out over spontaneity. We meet at Waterloo station in London and, with a flourish of our first-class tickets, we are whisked through the fast-track lane and straight into the Business Premiere lounge. So absorbed are we in our complementary mini-croissants and free newspapers that we almost miss the train. As the Eurostar slides away from the platform and the hot flannels and lunch menu are brought round, we open a bottle of rosé and toast our new grown-up adventure. 'Can you believe Eurostar didn't even exist in 1991?' I sigh, settling back in my comfy seat. 'We had to get the ferry from Dover.' 'And there was no internet!' offers Steph. 'No lastminute.com. No mobile phones! You had to use a phone box if you wanted to call home.' She's warming to her theme now. 'No euros! Remember all those different currencies?' 'OK, stop.' I say. 'I'm starting to feel old.' And this, I suppose, is the danger inherent in this kind of journey. If the past is a foreign country, perhaps it's one that should come with a Foreign Office warning: 'Tourists are advised against non-essential travel to places they visited when young. They may find themselves at increased risk of attacks of nostalgia and melancholy.' We have a few hours to kill in Paris before boarding the sleeper train which will carry us through the night to Venice. We drop our bags at the Gare du Nord, and head for the Pere Lachaise cemetery where we pay our respects to Oscar Wilde and Edith Piaf. Paris Bercy station is swarming with excited Italian and Spanish schoolchildren. The train is full but luckily we've reserved a two-bed sleeping compartment, something we would not have had the foresight, or the funds, to do on our first trip, resulting in some unorthodox sleeping arrangements. On one overnight journey from Brindisi to Venice we were squashed into a carriage with two big Italian mamas and a chain-smoking Bosnian who was fleeing the war in Yugoslavia. Jenny woke in the middle of the night to find him sucking her toes. As we slip through the suburbs of Paris in the fading light, the guard comes to our compartment and takes our reservation for the dining car. 'This is so civilised,' says Steph. The next morning, after a fitful sleep, I pull open the blinds to see water in every direction. The train appears to be in the sea. It takes me a couple of moments to realise we are in fact crossing the rail bridge which links Venice to the Italian mainland. As we approach Santa Lucia station the city rises up out of the lagoon to greet us. There's time for a quick cappuccino and a brioche in the sweetly old-fashioned station cafe before we emerge on to the steps, blinking in the morning sunlight. How could I have forgotten this? The glittering Grand Canal, the ice cream coloured palazzos, the gondoliers in their black and white striped tops. It's just a few steps to the waterbus stop where we hop on the vaporetto and cruise to our hotel, the NH Manin, which is right on the waterfront. It's a grand old villa with a lovely courtyard garden. Last time we were here, we stayed in a convent on Giudecca which offered beds to female travellers. After three sleepless nights on the decks of ferries and in train corridors, I thought I'd died and gone to heaven when I saw the peaceful dormitory with its row of crucifixes above beds covered in crisp white sheets. The doors would be locked and lights turned out at 10pm, the sister told us sternly. We nodded gratefully. For the next two days we wander around in a daze, hopping on and off vaporetti, getting lost, crossing bridges, exclaiming at the endless beauty of the place. It's heaving with tourists but even this does not detract from the city's otherworldliness. We spend a long time staring at the gold mosaics in the Basilica di San Marco. 'Did we come here before?' I ask. 'I don't know,' says Steph. 'I think I slept through Venice.' Oh I wish we could stay here all week! But I suppose that would be missing the point. InterRailing is not about getting under the skin of a place, it's about skimming across the surface, dipping into a few choice highlights and then moving swiftly on to the next stop. Our next stop is Verona, the city of Romeo and Juliet. The train is a sleek, double-deck affair. At Padua dozens of university students get on. They look so young and I suddenly understand why, on that first trip, we were constantly being asked why our parents weren't with us. Verona is well-heeled, elegant and very walkable. From the top of the fifteenth-century Torre dei Lamberti there are spectacular views across the city's piazzas and rooftops. Apparently. There are also 368 steps. Luckily the tower is closed for repairs so we enjoy a long lazy lunch of bigoli, the Veronese fat spaghetti, before spending an indecent amount of time trying on posh underwear in the shops of the swanky Via Mazzini. Twenty-four hours later and we are back on the train, heading west to Milan. It's an old-fashioned commuter train which stops at every station, but what the rolling stock lacks in glamour, the train staff more than make up for. The inspector who checks our tickets looks like Leonardo DiCaprio. It's at about this point in the journey that I realise we haven't actually spoken to anyone apart from waiters and ticket inspectors. Our original journey featured a constantly changing cast of fellow travellers. The first-class carriages are full of commuters and business people plugged into their laptops. 'Where are all the other 37-year-old InterRailers?' I wonder. 'I think they got married and had kids,' says Steph. Milan's Stazione Centrale is a masterpiece of the Fascist era, terrifying in scale and decorated with carved winged horses, gargoyles, cherubs, Art Deco flourishes and mosaics. Our hotel is in the shadow of the delicately gothic Duomo cathedral. We take a quick nocturnal walking tour of the centre: through the beautiful 19th century Galleria shopping arcade, past La Scala opera house and the Armani store that takes up an entire block. We are up early the next morning to catch a TGV train which will carry us across the Alps and up through eastern France into Paris. I've been looking forward to this journey and it occurs to me that maybe I am turning into a railway buff. It really is rather lovely travelling this way. No security checks, no queues, no interrogations. For a city built on high fashion and international finance, Milan has an awful lot of allotments. This is another aspect of rail travel I like. Creeping up behind a city while it's looking the other way, seeing all the bits that are normally hidden from view. Steph goes off to the buffet car to get us some drinks. As she returns, the automatic doors sigh open and a whiff of egg sandwiches, warm air and the sound of small children wailing wafts in from the carriage next door. 'It's hell back there,' she says, gesturing towards the standard-class carriage. 'I'm SO glad we are travelling first-class'. 'What was the buffet car like?' I ask. 'Uninspiring. I think I was imagining a dining car with white linen table cloths.' Hmmm. I can see the stakes are getting higher. It will have to be the Orient Express next time. Eventually, the suburbs of Milan give way to the dull, flat expanse of the Po Valley, where the country's arborio rice is grown. After an hour or so, the land becomes more rugged, eventually heaving itself up into the Alps. There is still snow on the tops of the mountains. At the station of Oulx, gateway to the ski resorts of Sestriere and Cesaria, the people on the platform are wearing woolly hats and ski jackets. One woman has her arm in a plaster cast. They stare at us in our sandals and summer dresses and we stare back. Tonight is our last night. Perhaps we should go to a nightclub? I'm worried this trip has been too sedate, too uneventful. There have been no mishaps, no narrow escapes, and none of the giddy sense of possibility that characterised our first InterRail trip. No toes have been sucked. No hearts broken. But on the plus side, I feel quite good. Like I've had a holiday. I am not suffering from malnourishment or sleep deprivation. And I do feel like I've been to these places now. Before, the countries we passed through just provided a rolling backdrop to whatever dramas, romances and gossip were playing themselves out in our overheated little bubble. This trip was just as much fun as the first one. But perhaps my idea of fun has changed. At 1610 we pull into the Gare de l'Est. Paris is basking in a spring heatwave and the trees are in blossom. We dump our bags in the hotel and head straight for the Louvre. It's my sixth visit to Paris and I'm determined actually to go inside this time rather than just having my picture taken by the glass pyramid. But we don't go in, of course. We take pictures of each other standing in front of the pyramid then, somehow, end up sitting in the cafe in the Jardin des Tuileries talking about friends and boyfriends and the best-selling novels that neither of us has quite got around to writing yet. The Louvre will have to wait until next time. Some things don't change. Essentials InterRail has revamped its range of passes. The old 'zones' system has been replaced and passengers can now opt for a single-country pass or a global pass, which is valid in all participating countries.

The proposed law, of eight clauses and six sub-clauses, was published in the official gazette this week. It represents the first step towards including the Neapoli tan pizza among products recognised by the EU as guaranteed traditional specialities. Pizzerias meeting the guidelines laid down in the bill will be able to distinguish their products with the Italian initials STG on their menus and in advertisements. The bill, drafted by government officials with the help and backing of Neapolitan pizza makers, stipulates the types of flour, yeast, salt and tomatoes that must be used. And it specifies that the dough has to be kneaded by hand. The cheese on the classic pizza margherita must be mozzarella \"from the southern Apennines\" and to qualify as a pizza margherita extra, the mozzarella needs to be made from buffalo milk. This will yield an ironic response from mozzarella producers in the area round Naples, who are equally anxious to preserve the identity of their own product and have been insisting that anything not made from buffalo milk is not mozzarella anyway. The bill declares that the genuine Neapolitan pizza is round and no more than 35cm (14 in) across. The rim must not rise by more than two centimetres. It was not immediately clear how the authorities intended to police these regulations, but the bill refers to \"checks\" on restaurants, suggesting that pizza-lovers in Italy may have to wait for their food while inspectors measure the depth of the crust.

I'm in the picturesque part of Tuscany not just for sightseeing and a bit of pizza, but to spend two weeks trying to get a grasp of Italian at the Dante Alighieri language school. And I'm suddenly feeling daunted at the thought. Brought up by an Italian mother who had, for her own reasons - and much to my chagrin - never taught me to speak her native tongue, I have long held dreams of travelling around Italy and learning the language of my own accord. We English speakers are often arrogant enough to assume our language will be spoken no matter where we go, but I am determined to rise above that and not simply follow the tiresome \"speak louder and slower\" method to get myself understood. Now, however, I'm remembering the speed at which my mother and her sister would talk at home - the sheer impenetrability of it as a child - and I'm wondering how successful a venture this will be. Nonetheless, incongruous though it may seem to be packing notepads and textbooks into our backpacks while on holiday, my boyfriend, Craig, and I set off for our first day of school. There are just three others in our beginners' class: Camilla, an Australian graphic designer determined to rival her linguistically adept sister; Claudia, a German secretary whose company has a base in Siena; and Julie, an American student who, before too long, is spelling her name \"Giulia\". From the outset we are encouraged to speak as much Italian as possible, no matter how bad or grammatically incorrect. \"Provate, provate, provate,\" says our teacher, Egina, over and over again. Practise, practise, practise. For two weeks, our daily timetable goes something like this: four hours of lessons every morning; a cheap but tasty lunch in the school cafeteria, during which we are inspired by the more advanced students, who come from all over the world; and in the afternoons, either a sightseeing visit or, two days a week, two more hours of conversation and culture classes. \"Cultural tourism\", it would seem, is the new black when it comes to travel. Bored with beaches and bland tourist food, many people are now seeking to satisfy either their social consciences or their desire to learn when they travel. Doing what the Romans do, so to speak. Siena offers a very achievable balance between vacation and education. Battling it out with its larger Tuscan rival, Florence, for the title of purest Italian accent, it teems with language students of all ages and backgrounds, providing the ideal environment to build your confidence with the patient locals as you bumble through poorly constructed sentences. The place is also packed with architectural riches such as the Piazza del Campo - the main square dominated by the Torre del Mangia, which offers breathtaking views over the city - the Duomo, a distinctively black-and-white-striped cathedral, and the Basilica di San Domenico, which interestingly houses the head of St Catherine. But there's more to it than that. Siena's heart is in the undulating cobbled streets packed with grocers, tobacco shops, sleek designer boutiques, cafes and pizzerias, all rammed up against each other like flowers sprouting up from different seeds. It's in the unmistakeable aroma of garlic and pastry faintly permeating the air. It's in the fiercely proud locals, divided up into 17 \"contrade\" - tiny suburbs, each with its own church, symbolic animal and insignia - who take each other on twice a year in the famous Palio horse race. The same locals who, rightly eager to preserve Siena's historic charm, were the first in Italy to impose a traffic ban on the heart of the city, making each stroll along the streets a quiet, fume-free pleasure. Being a student and a tourist can, admittedly, be quite hard work. One night during the first week, as we were busily revising, Craig and I find ourselves looking up from our notepads at each other and starting to giggle. \"I can't believe I'm doing homework on holiday,\" he says. But how rewarding it can be when you are completely immersed in a language and its corresponding culture. As a schoolgirl, I remember often feeling the impotence of learning things when it would be many years before I could put them into practice. Not so here. Each afternoon, I emerge from classes positively bursting with phrases that I'm keen to practise, and am always grateful when shopkeepers indulge me by listening and correcting where appropriate. There are other more subtle benefits to enrolling in language school, too. Being a student allows you discounts to many of Siena's attractions, museums and galleries, and puts you in the position to receive some invaluable cultural tips. \"Never drink a milky coffee after the morning,\" Egina advises us wisely. Otherwise, we will be dismissively branded as \"stranieri\" (foreigners), which I gather is very bad. Then there are those eureka moments when you realise how the Latin origins of the language collide with your own. \"Penne pasta!\" Craig and I shout in class excitedly, when we realise the plural word for pens - or quills - is \"penne\". But best of all, each tourist attraction takes on a new dimension as it becomes an educational opportunity and language exam all in one. It's actually quite exhilarating. Finishing up our two weeks in Siena, and about to take on other parts of the country to see how our Italian holds up, I have my greatest victory. I book a hotel in Rome, speaking not a word of English in the process. Feeling like the cleverest person on the platform, I jump on a train with Craig, hoping the next city will open its heart to us as wide as the last one did.

He had been in a coma for six weeks, but there had been no flowers, no cards, no phone calls and not a single relative at visiting time. Giorgio Angelozzi died utterly alone. Some people think he deserved to. After a lifetime of petty fraud and robbery, Angelozzi had hit on a winning formula for extracting money out of unsuspecting Italians. Posing as a lonely, penniless old man, recently widowed, abandoned by his family and forgotten by his pupils after a lifetime of teaching, he placed an advert in Corriere della Sera, Italy's most respected daily newspaper, offering €500 (£340) to any family who would adopt him as their grandad. A journalist on the paper spotted the ad, phoned the old man, and wrote a story that was picked up by every primetime chatshow in Italy. And so, with his white hair and old man's specs, il nonno (the grandfather) blinked out of millions of TV screens, a symbol of the frailty and loneliness of an abandoned generation. \"Remember that my problem is one that affects so many elderly people in Italy,\" he said. Like so much of Europe, Italy has a falling birth rate - now one of the lowest in the world - a soaring divorce rate, and a growing elderly population. Already, almost half of Italy's pensioners live alone. Angelozzi's plea triggered a wave of guilt and nostalgia for the large, close-knit family Italy was once famous for. And he rang another chord, too. Speaking in flowery language, full of classical references, il nonno warned that, in the frenzy of modern life, Italians were forgetting not just their grandparents but their ancient Roman ancestors; Italy's national identity itself was at stake. \"So many families answered my appeal because they want me to teach their children and their grandchildren about Horace and Catullus,\" he said. This was never going to be just a national story: it is not only in Italy that the old are isolated, and that social change is felt as a threat to \"traditional\" family life. The BBC leapt on the story, as did the international press agencies and, within days, Angelozzi had appeared in newspapers and on television networks all around the world. He was inundated with replies from families offering to \"adopt\" him - some of them from as far away as New Zealand. After \"interviewing\" his shortlist, he found his family. The Rivas were ripe - financially and emotionally - for the picking. They had recently lost both a live-in grandparent and an uncle, and the father of the family, Elio, was very ill. Angelozzi moved in for the kill. \"I drink this lady's voice like water in a desert,\" he mused to journalists. \"She sounds just like my dear dead wife.\" The Riva's home town threw a party when Angelozzi arrived, and all over the world people were relieved to see a happy ending. But eight months after moving in with the Rivas, il nonno left, having conned the family into paying for several operations and leaving behind a dentist's bill of €2,360 (£1,600). He was briefly detained by police weeks later when he stole a cheque book from another trusting family. But the relatively small sum involved and his age meant he could not be jailed. Only afterwards did it emerge that he had a seven-page criminal record, dating back to 1941. The dead wife he said he missed so much had in fact divorced him in 1971. The daughter he said was an aid worker abroad was living in Rome but doing her best to avoid him. And police were not sure if he had ever held down a teaching job. Even after this record was made public, the smooth-talking, inoffensive-looking grandad continued roving round Italy, talking people into paying for restaurant meals, clothes, train tickets. He even convinced residents of a retirement home to pool their spare cents for his benefit. Angelozzi was only stopped in his tracks by failing health. In September he was found writhing in agony on a park bench in Vicenza and taken to the hospital, where he died as a result of complications arising from diabetes. He left a trail of bitter families, friends and ex-lovers. His own children - no one is sure how many he had, but there are at least two - were apparently too ashamed to claim him as their father. In the weeks before he died, I tracked down the conman's sister, Giulia. Having covered the original story for this newspaper, I wanted to know what had become of him. She said she had not seen him for more than 30 years: \"Wherever he goes, there's trouble.\" I showed her a recent photograph of her brother. \"Cattiveria! [wickedness]\" she cried. \"Some people are just born with badness in them,\" said her husband, Vittorio. Angelozzi was born in Bagnolo del Salento, a village in the heel of Italy, the second of three children. Giulia was less than one year younger and the two of them were once very close. Their father was an accountant and their mother, Emma, a nursery teacher. \"Giorgio was a rascal from an early age. He was just too clever. He couldn't bear to live by the rules,\" says Giulia, scratching around for memories of the brother she has spent years trying to forget. \"My mother tried everything, you know. He was the apple of her eye. Every time he broke the rules he told her he couldn't help it, it was stronger than him.\" He tried joining the priesthood but left after three years. Years later she heard he had been expelled from France for his antics and banned from the city of Rome. Beneath the eloquent veneer, Angelozzi was a self-important, cantankerous and vulgar old man. Marlena Riva describes him now as \"despotic\". Wondering now how she fell for Angelozzi's yarn, Marlena confesses: \"I needed affection.\" Since the death of their live-in grandmother, the house had felt empty, she says; a generation was missing. When the wise, white-haired old man with the word \"angel\" in his name popped up on her TV screen one night, Marlena - a devout Catholic - decided he was \"sent\". If affection is what Marlena wanted, she got more than she bargained for. The old man hardly let her out of his sight, hovering at the door when she came home, stroking her hair as she sat down for a cup of tea and talking for hours over the kitchen table after the rest of the family had gone to sleep. \"He was vulgar and aggressive. Not the dignified man people saw on TV. But we kept thinking, 'Old people are bound to be a bit irritating.' And we couldn't have said anything because no one would have believed us,\" Marlena says. \"He was always criticising the children. We made a big pizza to celebrate his arrival and he said it wasn't good enough to eat. \"But after he left, I can't tell you how many pieces of chewing gum I've found stuck under the furniture. All over the house.\" Marlena is convinced he chose her family in the hope that he could step into the shoes of her husband, who has cancer, and become the man of their large house. \"He was always telling me about his sexual exploits. I think he wanted me to know he was still a man, if you know what I mean.\" Among his abandoned belongings Riva has found the names of several \"girlfriends\" Giorgio used to talk to on the phone in the granny flat they gave him: Signora Anna, Signora del Pierro, Signora Lucia, Signora Teresa. \"He's wrong in the head,\" says his sister, Giulia. \"Friends with everyone and loyal to no one.\" Angelozzi's body now lies in the Vicenza morgue, waiting for a relative to claim him. Though not exactly in mourning for the man, Marlena Riva would like to see him get a decent burial. She tells me that the body of a Moroccan immigrant has been waiting in the same freezer for two years, and a young man who committed suicide for six. The Riva family has asked the local authorities to organise a funeral. The Rivas want to go and pay their last respects. It looks like they will be the only ones there. \"How can we ask God for forgiveness for our sins one day if we do not pardon him?\" says Marlena. But she doesn't want to foot the funeral bill. The family have until tomorrow to claim his body. His sister, for one, is not planning to attend any funeral. When I broke the news of her brother's death to her, she sounded unmoved - relieved, even. \"Maybe it's better that way,\" she said. She says she's too old to travel to the funeral.","Id":"society/2005/nov/19/longtermcare.familysupplement","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"The rise and fall of 'Il nonno'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/nov/19/longtermcare.familysupplement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2005/nov/19/longtermcare.familysupplement","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":1494,"webPublicationDate":"2005-11-19T01:27:24Z","id":"society/2005/nov/19/longtermcare.familysupplement","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"The real Da Vinci code","body":"The book the curator at the Royal Library in Windsor Castle carefully lays on the desk before me is a tome of soft old sheets in a russet binding that was tooled, he says, in Milan in the late 16th century. Ancient gilt letters on the cover say DISEGNI DI LIONARDO DA VINCI RESTAURATI DA POMPEO LEONI (Drawings by Leonardo da Vinci restored by Pompeo Leoni). I open the colossal volume. As the ancient cover swings back, my eyes settle on ... nothing. Or rather on holes: pages and pages of holes. There are hundreds of sheets in the book. Each has been cut through with a knife by someone intent on removing what it once contained. The book is empty. For centuries, this object lay forgotten in the dark. War and fire raged all around it, and should have destroyed it. But it survived, and kept its precious cargo safe until one day it returned to the light. From that moment it was doomed. This empty volume is a clue to the mystery I'm here to solve. The jewel of the British Royal Collection is a collection of 600 or so sheets of drawings and notes by Leonardo da Vinci. They constitute the greatest work of art in Britain - no debate. They will star in this autumn's Leonardo show at the V&A, as they star in every Leonardo exhibition around the world. But no one actually knows - least of all the Royal Collection, which would love to - how they got here in the first place. There is no record of the drawings' owner for most of the 1600s, before the first mention of them in the Royal collection in 1690 - after which they vanished again until their discovery in a chest, in the reign of George III. Turning away from the husk of an album for now, I look at the drawings in Perspex mounts on what resemble big music-stands all along the desk. I have been looking all day through boxes of these sheets of ancient blue, red, and cream-coloured paper, manufactured in Italy in the 15th and early 16th centuries, that once lay secure inside that empty binding. At one point I accidentally held a blue sheet so the light was behind it and for a moment its desperate fragility became obvious. The design vanished and what remained was like a moth's wing - desiccated, webbed, strengthless. The sheet of notes on the stand is, however, incredibly well-preserved, in ink whose crisp decisiveness communicates scientific authority. In the largest and most iconic drawing on the sheet, two halves of a womb have been pulled back to reveal a human foetus, legs folded up, big bald ball of a head turned downwards, face hidden behind a perfect hand resting on a perfect knee. It looks as if it is only sleeping, so respectfully has Leonardo drawn what is both a scientific illustration, and so much more. He cut the dead mother's womb open to expose the foetus within but, as he takes up his pen, the scientist becomes the artist. You share his feeling of humility and awe at the spectacle of humanity's beginnings: the infinite possibility. He marvels at the big feet, the perfect ear, and, most of all, the shining dome of the skull, containing the germ of nature's supreme marvel, a human mind. Other images surround this drawing, including studies of the vascular walls of the uterus that mistakenly give it interlacing blobs called cotyledons, like those Leonardo had observed in a cow. Then there is the handwriting that, famously, flows in the opposite direction from most people's. An early set of reproductions of his anatomical drawings, engraved in 1796 soon after their rediscovery, renders this script as a blur. Nowadays, every word has been deciphered by scholars. On one of the sheets at Windsor, Leonardo makes clear from what gory solitude his study of the foetus was born: he remembers \"passing the night hours in the company of these corpses, quartered and flayed, and horrible to behold\". What a man called Mr Dalton found at the bottom of a chest in a royal palace one day in the 18th century was, quite simply, the greatest collection of evidence of Leonardo da Vinci's genius that survives - or at least that is known to survive. Everyone knows Leonardo left notebooks that massively amplify his small corpus of paintings. It is in his notebooks, scattered in museums and libraries across Europe, that his designs for inventions, scientific researches, plans for unfinished works, caricatures, landscapes, maps, emblems, architectural designs, and iconic images such as Vitruvian Man, are to be found. What is less well-known is that the collection of his drawings and notes at Windsor Castle is far and away the best of all. I'm not sure why this isn't more often acknowledged. Perhaps republicanism makes us want to talk up notebooks in public collections; perhaps internationalism makes us want to praise Italy's Codice Atlantico. More pathetically, deference to Bill Gates leads experts to collaborate in talking up the Codex Leicester, which he owns. Obviously, every letter of every word, every nuance of shading, from the hand of Leonardo is precious. But much of Italy's Codice Atlantico is concerned with abstruse problems; many pages have no drawings or only tiny ones. The same goes for the Codex Arundel, held in the British Library. By contrast, the album at Windsor combines Leonardo's greatest scientific research - his anatomies - with an abundance of artistic designs. It is the perfect Leonardo museum, bound in a book - or it was bound in a book, until its images were mounted and displayed by curators at the Royal Collection. The Mona Lisa and the handful of Leonardo's other surviving paintings are like a mask he wore. They are wonderful performances that play on our deepest psychological responses. Leonardo anticipated the surrealists in using raw psychic material in his art, as he explains in a note in the Vatican that recommends staring at a wall until you see images of mountains and battles. Yet they are not what he considered the core of his life's work. When Vasari and Sigmund Freud wrote about Leonardo, they wondered why he failed to finish paintings. The answer is that he was less interested in commissioned works than in his own quest to understand nature and humanity. It's in his manuscripts - more like scientific notes than the drawings of other artists - that you find the record of this. This is a detective story about art and war in the bloodiest period of British history. In the 17th century, Charles I was beheaded after causing a civil war that killed multitudes of his people. Somehow, while all those people were dying, the most precious and delicate relics of the Italian Renaissance - these drawings and notes - came to Britain. I may not be a Harvard professor of religious symbology or know much about the bloodline of the Magdalene, but I do enjoy a mystery and so I set out to solve this one. And I succeeded. Final proof is elusive, always, but in this case the circumstantial evidence is so overwhelming, I think I've got my man. I know who brought Leonardo's greatest drawings to Britain. The hunt begins in Milan, where in June this year big screens were being set up in front of the cascading gothic cathedral for people to watch one of Italy's first World Cup games. In the nearby Ambrosiana museum and library, which holds the Codice Atlantico, is an inscription engraved in marble that makes an amazing claim: that, in the 17th century, Count Arconati, who gave the Codex to this library, fought off a bid of £1,000 from the English king - \"ANGLIAE REX\" - to keep them in Italy. It was in Milan that Leonardo first started to make notes about everything. Born in 1452 in Tuscany, educated as an artist in Florence, he seems to have rebelled against the life of a jobbing painter and came to Milan hoping its ambitious ruler Ludovico Sforza would pay him to think. In Florence, he left the unfinished Adoration of the Magi, a painting that tries to be about everything - architecture, history, nature. Its teeming images of horses, battles and a staircase to nowhere strain to understand the world in a way that exceeds what others expected of art. This boundless curiosity is there in the pages and pages of notes he wrote until the end of his life, at Amboise in the Loire Vallery in 1519, where he had moved to be painter to the French king. Leonardo's will shows his great anxiety about the posthumous fate of his illustrated writings. He never published a word, but even so believed he was writing books. He left his notebooks to his favourite pupil, Francesco Melzi, a Milanese of noble birth: Melzi is to inherit, says the will, \"each and every one of the books, which the Testator now possesses\". Melzi took the books and unbound papers back to his own city, Milan, and did his best to organise them. He showed them to interested people such as the art chronicler Vasari, and laboured to produce at least one workable book manuscript from Leonardo's notes: a Treatise on Painting, whose manuscript is now in the Vatican. A version of this was published in France in 1651. But, by then, Melzi was long dead, and Leonardo's notebooks were on their complicated journey around Europe. Melzi's heirs in Milan did not understand the peculiar documents they had inherited; they let the notes rot, allowed visitors to take them away wholesale. Eventually, the Italian sculptor Pompeo Leoni got his hands on huge quantities of Leonardo's drawings and notes, and bound them into leather volumes. By 1690, the most significant of Leoni's albums was in the hands of the British monarchy. How did such a precious volume get to Britain without being noticed? Why wasn't its arrival recorded? How did it survive? And the underlying mystery - why were the puritanical British, whose island was regarded by Renaissance Italians as an obscure barbarian land, even interested in it? The answer to that last question is not hard to find in London. On Whitehall is the last surviving part of Whitehall Palace - Inigo Jones' towering classical box of a Banqueting Hall with ceiling frescoes by Peter Paul Rubens. This and other surviving islands of Baroque London are proof enough that the British court was acutely interested in art and architecture in the early 17th century. Charles I imported the Catholic splendour of the Baroque to Britain - he was portrayed in marble by the Pope's personal artist Bernini, and employed court artists such as Rubens and Van Dyck, as well as the Italians Artemisia Gentileschi and her father Orazio. When Charles was still prince, he visited Madrid in a daring undercover mission to make a political marriage. He didn't get married in the end, but he did see a lot of art, and cheekily asked for Titians as presents. It's surprising how political this all is, four centuries on. Royalists make such a fuss about Charles as a tasteful, sensitive soul - ignoring evidence that he was a stupid, dogmatic, inadequate man who brought his people to civil war; a backlash against him was inevitable. Jerry Brotton's book The Sale of the Late King's Goods, published this year, sees Charles I's art collecting far more sceptically, as a story of deals and negotiations with no love at its heart. Maybe. But as far as I can see, from looking at paintings such as Moses in the Bulrushes by Orazio Gentileschi, and still more at his daughter Artemisia's Self-Portrait as the Muse of Painting, Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria presided over a court that rivalled the artistic excellence of continental capitals. The London of Charles I was becoming more civilised, in a European Catholic way. Upon his accession in 1625, one of King Charles I's very first acts was to swap a portrait of Erasmus by Hans Holbein for a painting that belonged to the French king - Leonardo da Vinci's Saint John the Baptist, today in the Louvre. Bare-shouldered with an enigmatic smile, pointing up at heaven - in fact his vertical finger caresses a cross so dark you don't immediately see it in the shadows - Leonardo's Baptist seems more profane than sacred. To the Protestants responsible for the fate of Charles' art collection after his beheading, its sexual quality can only have added to its repellent papism. It was sold abroad and ended up back in the French royal collection. What happened, in the brutal 17th century, to bring Pompeo Leoni's Leonardo album to London? In the Pizza Express on Windsor High Street, the Royal Collection's dapperly dressed Leonardo expert, Martin Clayton, shares his hunch - just a hunch, he insists - that, who knows, maybe Charles I himself grabbed the album on his youthful adventure to Madrid. Nice hunch. But when I mention it later to Martin Kemp, professor of art history at Oxford and curator of the V&A's Leonardo show, he jokes that Clayton is a \"courtier\", predisposed to find evidence of royal good taste. I go to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford to follow up another lead: Thomas Howard, Second Earl of Arundel and Charles I's most knowledgeable adviser on art. I've read a slightly breathless tribute to Arundel, claiming he knew more about Italy than any Englishman before him. I've come here to see if that's even slightly plausible. The Ashmolean owns many Greek and Roman sculptures from Arundel's collection, and it's obvious looking at them that he was no mere aristocratic snaffler. He excavated sculpture himself in Rome and obtained, at what must have been huge expense and effort, authentic examples of Greek art from Asia Minor. Arundel collected drawings, too. He had so many drawings that a purpose-built room had to be created for them in his mansion on the Strand. When he was living in exile in Italy at the end of his life, he told the diarist John Evelyn the true story behind the plaque in the Ambrosiana library in Milan. It was not really the king, he explained, but he, Arundel, who had tried to buy the Codex Atlanticus. The king had given permission to use his name. Now, he said, he could see his \"folly\" - the Codex wasn't worth the £1,000 he had offered. But how did he know this? I think the truth is, he had seen better. He had seen the Leoni album that was to end up in the Royal Collection. During the civil war, when Arundel was living in exile, the Bohemian artist Wenceslas Hollar published engravings of Leonardo's drawings. The engravings depict the very Leonardos now at Windsor. Only a couple have a credit saying they come from the Arundel collection - but it would be a fair assumption that if Arundel had one drawing, he had them all: by this time, all 600 or so drawings were bound in Leoni's single album. There are two possibilities here: either Arundel had bought Leoni's album himself in Madrid; or Charles I had imported it, and it came into Arundel's hands during the civil war. Either way, what is clear is that the album had reached court circles before the death of Charles I. So do we owe its provenance to the brilliant collecting instincts of these two men? I don't think so. Arundel and Charles were intense, but narrow, men. They were interested, informed, even passionate when it came to art - but they weren't geniuses. And the acquisition of the world's best collection of Leonardo notes and drawings points to a collecting genius. In 1629, someone came to the court of Charles I who understood Leonardo da Vinci better than anyone. I first saw the clue to my man's identity in a portrait of Arundel in the National Gallery in London. It's a very loving portrait. The artist obviously admires and likes Thomas Howard, seeing in him not merely a powerful courtier but a friend. Did I say the clue was in the painting? The clue is the painting. It is one of several portraits of Arundel by his friend, the artist, diplomat, courtier and scholar Peter Paul Rubens. Born in Germany to an Antwerp family, getting his higher education in an extended trip to Italy, Rubens became the greatest of all Baroque painters. He is a supreme court artist who proves what every courtier, and perhaps every intellectual wants to believe - that erudition and style can transmute into genius. No one can dispute Rubens' genius even if it is a system of quotations, a supercharged commentary on Caravaggio and Michelangelo, Titian and Raphael and - obsessively - Leonardo. Rubens was particularly transfixed by the legend of Leonardo's lost, painting The Battle of Anghiari. He got his hands on a 16th-century drawing of this vanished painting, adding his own swirling horses' manes and bulging eyes. It haunts his lion hunts, battles, conversions of St Paul, every horse and monster he ever painted. Where did Rubens learn enough about Leonardo to be able to convincingly reimagine a lost work by him? There is a drawing in the Royal Collection - it will feature in the V&A show - in which, in preparation for his battle painting, Leonardo portrays horses' faces in frenzy. Teeth champ, eyes bulge. Of all the drawings by Leonardo that survive, this is the closest in spirit to Rubens' drawing of The Battle of Anghiari. Rubens knew the drawing, and he therefore knew the Leoni album. We have to go back to that crucial fact: all the drawings were by now in a single album. To know one was to know them all. When Rubens came to London, his mission was to make peace between the Spanish and the English courts. What better way to charm Charles I than pointing him to a truly unique treasure? It was Rubens who pointed the king and Arundel towards the Leonardo he loved himself - the expression and movement you encounter in the drawings at Windsor, from his designs for The Last Supper to his monstrous caricatures. When, in a book-lined study in Oxford, I mention Rubens to Kemp, he gets quite excited. Follow up the Rubens lead, suggests Kemp, my Deep Throat, and you won't go far wrong. Rubens left the English court in 1630. In Antwerp, he reworked one of his greatest paintings, a river landscape that is a fantastical version of the Thames running through a dreamlike England. In this landscape Rubens sets the story of Saint George and the Dragon. The holy knight George is personified by Charles I; the damsel he rescues is Queen Henrietta Maria. Rubens had started it during his visit to London, but later added horrific details - half-eaten corpses, the dragon's victims. The body nearest to us lies on its front. The skin has been removed, either by the dragon's fiery breath or the process of decay. The man's flayed arms reveal their inner structure: muscles and tendons laid bare. On the torso you can see vertebrae, ribs, internal organs. He might have been dissected. I think these corpses allude directly to the anatomical drawings of Leonardo da Vinci. The flayed corpses surround Saint George just as Leonardo's anatomical drawings surrounded Charles and his circle in life, on the advice of Rubens. A detective story usually starts with the corpse. In this case, it is the final clue that links Peter Paul Rubens, the British monarchy, and the genius of Leonardo da Vinci. It tells us how his masterpiece got here.

They are noisy and inconsiderate yet fun to be around. They are impractical and temperamental yet effortlessly stylish. A mix of things that shouldn't work but somehow do. So I guess I shouldn't have been surprised when a 1961 Vespa proved to be the perfect host as I spent a summer travelling from Milan to Rome in this maddening, invigorating country. The idea to ride around Italy on a Vespa first came to me as a teenager growing up in Australia. Sydney wasn't the lively, cosmopolitan city back then that it is today. Dinner was meat and two veg and Sunday afternoon television consisted of Laurel and Hardy re-runs. Occasionally a dilettante at the television station would run an old black and white Italian movie like La Dolce Vita - or a Hollywood one like Roman Holiday - and we'd have lasagne. On those days I'd get a glimpse of another world on our flickering TV set. It was a place where all a guy had to do to look cool was jump on a Vespa and buzz down to a cafe where a clutch of glamorous women with big, pointy and slightly dangerous-looking breasts would flirt with him. For a young bloke with greasy hair and still wearing flannelette shirts this was quite a revelation. If I wanted to go anywhere I had to ask my dad to give me a lift to the train station. And when I got there the girls chewing gum and wearing boob tubes would totally ignore me. I'd sit on the train into town replaying those movies in my mind so that it was me riding around the countryside drinking espresso and flirting with women with curvaceous figures and dark, burning eyes, not Marcello Mastroianni. One day, I promised myself, I'd live the dolce vita, the sweet life, like Marcello, in a sharp suit and Ray-Bans. The summer I turned 40 I found a vintage Vespa I liked the look of on eBay Italy and decided to make my dream a reality. The Vespa was a pale coffee colour and as old as me, with two saddle seats and a chrome crash bar that ran along each side, protecting its voluptuous curves. In true Italian fashion I bought it on a whim without realising that it was impossible for a foreigner to own or register a vintage motorcycle in Italy. All I knew was that I'd found a Vespa exactly like the one I had wanted to ride around Italy on as a teenager. It should have ended in tears then and there. According to the rules of eBay I had seven days to send €1,200 to a man in Milan for a bike I'd never seen that I couldn't legally own. But Gianni, the bike's owner, answered my feverishly concerned emails about rules and regulations with Latin nonchalance. I could pay him when I arrived in Milan. Indeed, if I didn't like the bike I could walk away from the deal. As for riding it around Italy, I could keep it registered in his name until I was ready to export it. What had appeared to my Anglo Saxon mind as an insurmountable wall of bureaucratic red tape was regarded as an intriguing obstacle to be circumvented by Gianni's more Latin mindset. 'There is the law and there is intelligence,' he said sagely. And when it looked like it would take six weeks to get a particular piece of paperwork from the Italian DVLA he promised the woman behind the counter that he'd take her for pizza e vino in a romantic bar on a cobbled street in Milan and it was issued immediately. I spent three months riding from Milan to Rome, lingering on the Ligurian coast before criss-crossing the fields of Tuscany to the ancient capital. Because my Vespa was only 125cc I wasn't allowed on motorways and had to take the B-roads instead. It was a world of stone villas and roads lined with cypress pines and more often than not I'd find myself riding through fields of stunning yellow sunflowers so bright and cheerful-looking that I couldn't help but smile. At other times I'd wind my way up to Medieval hilltop towns and park on cobbled main squares while cars full of tourists remained stuck in the massive carparks outside. I could feel the sun on my skin, smell the freshly cut lucerne. Even the reng-deng-deng of the two-stroke engine seemed right. Travelling through the Italian countryside I came to think of the sound of my Vespa's engine as the amplified buzzing of a summer wasp. It was the simple little things about my Vespa that made it so perfect for the trip. Like the bag-holding hook under the front seat. I bought provisions every morning as I left a town, hung the bags from the hook and then stopped for a picnic lunch somewhere suitably picturesque. Buying the provisions for those picnics became an integral part of my journey too. The morning I left Massa Marittima, an old mining town high in the Colline Metallifere, was typical of my daily routine. I visited the Casa della Frutta, the house of fruit, and the woman serving gave me an impromptu Italian lesson by slowly pronouncing the name of each item as she put them on the scale. At Panifica Romano the baker suggested the panini frusti Genovesi, a Genoese style bread that he sold by weight at €3.62 a kilo. At Il Salumiere, I dodged the different shaped pastas in clear cellophane packets tied with ribbon hanging from the door, and picked up some boconcini, olives and local wild boar ham. It would have been quicker and more convenient to visit the Co-op supermarket on the outskirts of town but it wouldn't have been half as much fun. I finished my shopping trip with a cappuccino (it was before 10am so I could drink it without causing offence) and a bombolone at a cafe on Piazza Garibaldi. I added lots of sugar to the coffee to match the sweetness of the custard-filled doughnut, and watched a black hearse pull into the square and stop outside the cathedral. The church bells tolled three sad notes - up, up, down - and everyone in the town stopped and stood still in silent respect as the coffin was carried into the church. A couple of nuns hung outside in black, looking like ravens, ready to comfort the mourners. They spotted a group of old ladies sobbing and swooped in, holding their hands and kissing their wet cheeks. When I rode past on my Vespa, the bags of food swinging from the under-seat hook, I was a natural part of the scene, not an interloper. Indeed, everywhere I went on my Vespa I was greeted as an old friend. In Broni a farmer insisted on showing me an old Vespa rotting in his shed, before sharing a simple meal of ham and wine with me in his modest farmhouse. In Massa Marittima the local garbage man said he was full of ' stupefatto ' - amazement - when he saw my old Vespa and offered to get his Rally 200 scooter and show me the hidden corners of this part of Italy. Marco, a Vespa restorer I met in the port town of Livorno, insisted on taking me to Bar Civili, an institution he grandly claimed was the 'most famous ponce bar in the world'. Ponce is a Livornese drink made of rum, coffee and sugar and finished with a piece of lemon peel. Ponce is a mispronunciation of the English word 'punch', and was an attempt to make the Royal Navy rum brought into the port by English sailors more palatable. Marco was quite a connoisseur of the stuff. He explained that the rum was from the Antilles and because it was rough and strong the Livornese added coffee and sugar. The Civili was equally steeped in history. Tucked away among blocks of faded and worn apartments near the railway station, it has been a self-proclaimed 'bar, meeting place, institution and temple to continuity' for over 100 years. It was small and cosy, with arches and wooden beams that appeared lower than they were because of all the football pennants stuck to them. The bar attracted a mixed crowd. Cool girls with bindis sipped on Persiana, a startling green drink named after the colour of Livorno's window shutters, while old guys in cloth caps sat at tables knocking back beer and soda, another Livornese beverage. Elsewhere a group of thirtysomething men were playing cards. At the bar, a salty old sea captain, looking like something out of a Robert Louis Stevenson novel, was knocking back ponce like he was about to go to sea for a decade or two. With a wave of his hand Marco ordered three more and we joined the old sea dog at the bar. The ponce he ordered had a small piece of lemon skin floating in it and was called ponce a vela. ' Vela means with a sailor,' he explained. 'The Livornese used to think the skin of the lemon looked like the skin of a sailor.' I knocked it back and declared it a very fine drink, making nearly as many friends with that one comment as I did by riding a Vespa. It helped that I was riding an old Vespa. The Italian government has a policy of rotamazione, paying people €1,000 to crush their old bikes to meet EU emission levels, so there are very few vintage Vespas left on the road. Mechanics fixed my Vespa for free, happy to keep a little piece of Italian heritage going. Hotel managers gave me their best rooms and discount rates. Farmers tilling fields looked up to watch me pass. And I lost count of the number of times people on other scooters rode beside me smiling broadly and asking me questions in Italian. I had underestimated how dearly Italians hold Vespas. Those simple elegant lines are part of their DNA. For older generations the Vespa was the cheap family vehicle that helped the country get back on its feet after the Second World War. To teenagers in the 60s and 70s it was a cheap and stylish ticket to freedom. Even today the release of a new model is a subject of debate, with people from all walks of life having an opinion on whether the Vespa spirit has been retained. I quickly discovered that every Italian has a Vespa story and every Vespa has one too. Mine was originally bought by a young man to court his future wife. The chrome accessories that I loved so much had been fitted not to look flash but rather to impress upon his future father-in-law that he was a man of means. I met another chap whose family used to pile on the family Vespa every Sunday and go to the local village. When they got there they had to decide on buying petrol or pizza. If it was pizza, his father had to push the Vespa home. When I stopped for coffee near Rome I returned to find a middle-aged woman standing beside my Vespa crying. 'It is the Vespa of her youth,' her daughter explained. My journey through Italy on a vintage Vespa ended in Rome on a weekend with my girlfriend Sally and I pretending we were in Roman Holiday, the movie that featured Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck buzzing around Rome on a metallic green Vespa 125. Sally had flown over from London and, to her credit, did a pretty good impression of Audrey Hepburn. But sadly, I was a decidedly low-rent Gregory Peck. It did highlight one thing though. The joy of riding a Vespa, like the joy of visiting Italy, is one that is meant to be shared. Corradino D'Ascanio had this in mind when he designed the Vespa. When I first set eyes on my Vespa in Milan, Gianni told me that the reason the engine was at the back of the bike on the right-hand side was to counter balance the weight of the legs of female passengers riding side-saddle dangling on the other. It was a message that Piaggio were not backward in promoting. Advertising for Vespas initially emphasised the bike's affordability and highlighted the company's radical easy payment plan. But as post-war Europe became more affluent the message changed. Vespa posters started showing young and happy couples doing romantic and exciting things while straddling their ever faithful Vespa. Once the domain of families who clambered aboard six at a time, Vespas were now for lovers. Him, her and the Vespa. It was a bizarre love triangle that Piaggio encouraged by producing a series of postcards for lovers and sweethearts to send each other from all over Europe. They depicted couples in romantic situations on their Vespas and while they appear twee today they were phenomenally popular back then. A card featuring a suave young couple parked beside the running track at the empty Olympic stadium in Rome, for example, was one of the most sent postcards in Italy in 1964. I must admit I did have a series of Vespa postcard-type snapshots in my mind that I hoped to play out while Sally visited. In them Sally always wore a scarf and cats-eyes sunglasses and I, bizarrely, had the ability to play the double bass. My little old Vespa proved to be the perfect guide to the Eternal City. The weekend passed like a movie directed by William Wyler, a slide show of Roman sights from the back of a buzzing old Vespa. We zipped up tiny lanes with wash ing strung between them, past the craftsmen on Via dell'Orso repairing chandeliers and making gilt frames and right up to the door of ancient monuments. When we ate lunch in a cafe overlooking the Pantheon, I was able to park my Vespa with a group of other scooters only metres away. That night we ate in Trastevere. With its lively crowds, cafes and restaurants and kiosks selling slices of watermelon and grattachecca - flavoured ice - it had that brio, that liveliness that jumped off the screen and shook me as a 15-year-old boy watching old movies. We ended the evening back at Trevi Fountain. Sally loved the movie Three Coins in the Fountain and wanted to see the world-famous fountain it featured. 'You've never lived until you've loved in Rome!' she said, quoting the movie's tag line with a grin. A pack of scousers on a stag night jumped into the fountain and made like Anita Ekberg in La Dolce Vita. One of the guys, a large chap, even had breasts to rival Anita's. As we left I tossed a coin and made a wish. Tradition states that if you throw one coin in you'll return to Rome. Two and you'll fall in love with an Italian. Sally teased me by challenging me to throw in another coin after the first but I told her I didn't have to, I was already in love with an Ital ian. She was a fading beauty that I'd met on the internet and I'd just spent a magical three months with her picnicking beside fields of sunflowers, wandering through medieval hilltop towns and listening to old Dean Martin records. Thanks to her I'd seen a side of her country that I wouldn't have otherwise seen. It was just too bad she was a motor scooter. Have your own Roman holiday Numerous companies in Rome and all the other big cities offer Vespa hire. See www.tassoni.it/guide/moto-bike-rent.htm for companies in the capital. A Vespa costs about £30 a day to hire, including insurance. You do not need a motorbike licence to ride a scooter under 50cc, but the maximum speed limit is 25mph. Larger engined scooters require you to have a licence. Technically people as young as 14 are allowed to drive 50cc scooters, but in practice most hire companies will only rent to over-18s. One warning - the drink-drive limit in Italy is almost half the level it is in Britain.

Here, they drink Coke and flirt with well-fed Italian UN soldiers, who, when not carousing, perform important duties like flexing and oiling their gym-pumped muscles by the hotel's pools. That's pools: plural; in a country that has been suffering a five-year drought. This is a country overrun by well-cushioned foreign soldiery, 4x4-borne charities and NGOs. There are so many of these that sometimes theirs are the only cars on the dusty roads leading into and out of this extraordinary, and largely bypassed, city set high on the East African escarpment; high enough to set your heart racing if you rush about on your first day here. I mention the girls, the soldiers and the Intercontinental, because this unholy triptych representing contemporary Asmaran life prompted me to wonder if Eritrea has ever truly shaken off its colonial yoke. This was an Italian colony from 1898, when the first governor was appointed, until 1941 when the British won control of this blisteringly hot Red Sea country. It later became an Ethiopian dependency, until after a 30 year war, Isiais Afewerki and his plastic sandal-wearing Eritrean Peoples Liberation Front won control of their own country. For the next seven years, Eritrea basked in a reputation of being one of the most open and tolerant countries in Africa before a renewed clash with Ethiopia led to a presidential clampdown and a return to the country of all those UN troops spooning with the local girls, and NGOs by the baffling-acronym load. Even so, Asmara itself is one of the most enchanting cities in Africa. I nearly typed \"Italy\", for this is a city largely created by the Italians over a very short period, and one in which the surprised visitor will find astonishingly similar to some in southern Italy and especially those built on the Pontine marshes by Mussolini in the 1930s. Here you can eat all the pizza, pasta and ice cream your stomach could possibly desire, along with goat stew mopped up by injera, a sponge-like local pancake that may, or may not, be made with wheat. Pavement cafes proffer cappuccino and espresso from vintage Italian coffee machines along with saccharine-sweet Arabic mint tea and refreshing Asmara (formerly Melotti) beer. At sunset, the city sets out on a passegiatta, old men in double-breasted suits doffing Borsolino hats as they stroll along wide pavements under royal palms. They address foreigners in the Italian they learned as boys when what is now an utterly convincing Italian modernist city of the 1930s was a frenetic building site. Between 1935 and 1941, young Italian architects, and seasoned contractors working to a detailed urban plan, built somewhere between 400 and 500 fine new designs here: theatres, cinemas, hotels, churches, mosques, covered markets, city halls and, of course a Casa del Fascio. The Casa del Fascio, shaped in the guise of a giant rendered-concrete \"F' is now a part of the ministry of education. It broods, although in ice cream colours, so it can't be all that broody, at one end of Harnet, or Independence Avenue, the broad thoroughfare that characterises and sets the pace for this would-be east African Rome and which has changed its name with each new regime, indigenous or imperial. Mussolini's architects did a fine job. Whatever the outrages and injustices of his Fascist regime, Asmara is a thoroughly well planned and good looking city. Here is one place in the world where surely anyone might allow themselves to give in to the sometimes cold and remotely intellectual charms of modernism. Coloured like confectionery, bejewelled with purple jacaranda and red bougainvillea, and set under high blue skies, how could anyone take offence and wish for more obviously romantic \"colonial\" or mud-hut architecture? This Italian modernism is, in large part, Asmara's saving grace. Many of the city's buildings might be 70 years old, yet they remain incorrigbly Modern with a capital M. Asmara is not wealthy - far from it - and yet with its lively cafe culture and the natural grace and good manners of its people, it feels absolutely nothing like the desperate and downtrodden African cities we know all too well from TV news reports and the fund-raising efforts of well-meaning pop stars. There is something, too, very special, despite the current clampdown on civil liberties, in the tolerant way Asmarinos share their lives. Here, Muslims, Catholics, Coptic and Greek Orthodox Christians and a handful of Jews live and work cheek by jowl. They all have fine buildings to celebrate their God: a 1920s Gothic cathedral, which seems much older, on Harnet Avenue for the Catholics; the twin-towered and richly mosaiced Coptic Mariam cathedral; the handsome Al Qurafi al Rashidin mosque at the head of the central market buildings dating from 1937; the pretty Greek Orthodox church of St George; and a modestly scaled neoclassical synagogue. Ancient and hard-held beliefs exist alongside the ice cream world of 1930s Italy. If you want to see a film, try the Impero Cinema on Martyrs Avenue, a beautifully restored art deco monument, robed in the rich colours of a Roman emperor's toga. If you want music and nightclubs, there is plenty of that and those. As for restaurants, you can eat Sudanese and Indian as well as Asmarino-Italian. To watch the city go by, sit at one of the outside tables at the Bar Impero or Pasticeria Moderna on Harnet Avenue. In fact, you will be watching the world go by, too. The Asmarino diaspora has been on a biblical scale in recent years. My mid-morning coffee at the Moderna was paid for one morning by a man who had lived the past 30 years in Oslo, and missed the snow, while, across from us, a young man, recently back from New York sported baseball cap, hood, saggy trousers, high-rise trainers, mobile phone and a big, pouting sneer as if downtown Asmara was somehow da South Bronx. This look, by the way, is thought eccentric: smiles, smart dress and good manners, even when there is so little money, are the norm rather than pouting, sneering, global brand culture. How the city has been so well preserved might seem something of a miracle in poor country especially after so many decades of war. Fighting, though, has nearly always been in blisteringly hot rural areas, along desert borders, up and down the coast, and through devilish mountains passes. When the British took Asmara in 1941, they had bombed just one building. Mind you, the miserable sods stripped the city of much of its industrial machinery along with essential parts of its infrastructure. Although ordinary soldiers had been delighted, and amazed, to find a modern city, all ice cream, cinemas, Alfa-Romeos and gorgeous girls, their superiors considered Asmara too good for the locals. Their attitude was that the Italians had overspent and that it was only right to strip the city of modern machinery that could be used more profitably elsewhere by insatiably business-minded Brits. To this day, many of the seemingly modern buildings in the city centre lack running water, bathrooms and lavatories. While, at the edge of the city, the choking Medeber market is witness to huge numbers of Asmarinos recycling absolutely anything that can be turned into something useful: beds from lorry springs, chairs and tables from oil cans. The city centre is now, effectively, a listed zone where new buildings will only rarely be allowed. The Cultural Assets Rehabilitation Programme (CARP) was set up in 1996 to record the city's architecture and to educate children as well as business people and developers across the country to look after their unparalleled urban heritage. Asmara may yet become a Unesco World Heritage Site. It fully deserves to be. Perhaps the most unexpected restoration has been that of the enchanting Eritrean State Railway, which spirals in death-defying fashion down the escarpment from Asmara to meet the Red Sea at Massawa, another fascinating, although heavily war-damaged city, as well as being one of the very hottest on earth. The narrow-gauge railway, built by the Italians, has been rebuilt without outside help. National pride has seen to that. The necessary expertise lay in the hands and memories of long retired railwaymen, who have returned to bring the railway back to life. I went to talk to these veterans, the youngest in his mid-70s, the oldest closing in on a century. They are training twentysomething apprentices who clearly adore the old men. The trains, by the way, are as special as you would hope them to be; saloon coaches hauled by Italian-built Mallet compounds. I won't explain, but, be assured that these machines are as rare as a glass of cold Asmara beer in Khartoum or an Italian UN soldier not leering after local girls in the Intercontinental (instead, try the airy, Swiss-style Hamaisen/Ambasoira, downtown). The most striking thing about these impressive mechanical mountaineers is their dating: builders' plates on their cab-sides give the year of their construction according to the Fascist calendar; so, a loco built in 1938 proclaims its date of birth as XVI, the 16th year of the new Fascist empire. I don't think you will see this anywhere else in the world, although you probably don't really want to. The thrilling ride to Massawa takes up to 10 hours, and so is only really for well-seasoned railway enthusiasts. There are, of course, no cheap flights to Eritrea. Tourism is in its infancy. There is little water, most of it unsafe to drink. The country is poor. It can be very hot indeed. Border disputes might break out at any time. Yet, where else will you find a city like Asmara?

I have always been in love with good food. The real thing. For this reason, years and years ago, when I first came to the UK, I adored a good plate of British roast beef or steak and kidney pie followed by a hearty portion of bread and butter pudding. I will never forget that, as a young student in the early 50s, when I was at a college in Mumbles, a small Welsh village, now famous for having given birth to Catherine Zeta-Jones, I relied on fish and chips wrapped in newspaper from a local fish and chip shop to keep me going. How good they were. Those who criticise British food are in the wrong. I believe that many British dishes, when properly and freshly prepared with the correct ingredients, are quite delicious. In my role as ambassador, when I have entertained Italian guests in this country, I have often served British dishes so as to offer my guests the opportunity of tasting the best of Britain. Nowadays, it is becoming increasingly difficult even here to find the real thing. In many cases, Italian tourists visiting Britain tell me they too have difficulty in finding authentic British dishes and have to make do with pale imitations based on the wrong ingredients and poorly presented. This same \"perversion\" is noticeable in all the different kinds of foreign food, including Italian food, available here. The result is that too often some masterpieces of Italian cuisine are unrecognisable. I do thus understand the interest generated by an interview I gave recently in which I deplored the very idea of a pineapple pizza. Everyone is entitled to eat whatever they wish. I do object, however, to such a dish being described as Italian. A pizza base covered with pineapple or with curry is no more Italian than a steak and kidney pie covered with chocolate is English. How have we come to this? In a generation, all over Europe, we have witnessed a deep evolution of the ways of eating and indeed of our relationship with food. Nobody would have thought in the years after the second world war that olive oil or fettuccine or indeed paella Valenciana would become household names in the British Isles. When I was a young boy, I was taught by my mother about the sacred value of food. A gift from God. When bread was made in my house, a sign of the cross would be made on the dough. You had to respect food because, among other reasons, it was so scarce. Since then, food has undergone a process of, if I may say so, secularisation and democratisation. Balsamic vinegar or prosciutto were in the past prepared by the poor for the rich. Fortunately, nowadays practically everybody in the western world can afford them. New methods of production and better systems of transport have made it possible to make foodstuffs from all over the world available in Europe. The production and trade of food, and all kinds of commerce related to food have become big business. When I came to live in London, in the 60s, as a junior diplomat, only a very small shop in Soho sold Italian food. If we looked for olive oil outside of London, we had to go to a pharmacy where it was sold in very small bottles for health purposes. In the past 20 years, we have witnessed an explosion of Italian food products in the UK. Nowadays, these can be purchased in almost every corner shop in the land, as well as in all supermarket chains. Exact figures are difficult to obtain, but there are more than 6,000 Italian restaurants in the UK and far more eating places serving some kind of \"Italian\" dish. The reason for this revolution may be found in the appeal of the Italian way of life and of its culture. And let me say how happy I am, being an unrepentant Anglophile, that this revolution is still spreading at an ever faster pace. Of course, a love and an overwhelming interest in Italian culture have given many Britons the desire to know more about its food. On the other hand, Italian cuisine is not only good and, more important, healthy, but also easy to learn to cook - as many TV programmes and books have demonstrated. It is also understandable that British visitors to Italy love to relive the emotions of their trip through the taste of Italian food. When they are back home, food - for those who appreciate it - can vividly recreate the atmosphere and feelings associated with their holiday. Naturally, this revolution has not taken place without problems. Ideally, Italian restaurants should use Italian ingredients, good chefs and good-humoured waiters. But as we know, this is not always the case. Italian cuisine is based to a large extent on genuine and natural ingredients and these can be expensive. But it is not only the fault of the restaurateurs. Customers are also to blame, as they do not often understand why they should pay more for a simple dish presented in the right way. It is not essential that potatoes are grown in Italy. It is, however, essential that artichokes come from Rome, prosciutto from Parma and red radicchio from Treviso because they have no equivalent. Too many people in the food industry are interested only in making a fast buck; and so sometimes the result is that some Italian restaurants are offering dishes that have no relation whatsoever to Italian food. And just as certain Indian dishes do not exist in Indian cuisine, \"spaghetti bolognese\" does not exist in Bologna at all. Good Italian cuisine is delicate and does not make use of great quantities of garlic and heavy spices so easily found in dishes served in so-called \"Italian\" establishments. I wish all the luck in the world to the food and pizza chains that use an Italian name; but I have to say that these products must be judged with a large pinch of salt. What can each of us do to reverse this trend? I am not as nostalgic about the past as to believe that we should go back to the ways of my childhood when food had its sacred value. Of course, we must be thankful that the days of scarcity and penury are over. But I do think that we should have more respect for food which threatens our waistlines and of which we talk so much more about nowadays (but which is still a dream for so many human beings in poor countries). The bottom line comes down to culture. I would strongly recommend introducing the study of food and its benefits in schools as part of an obligatory study programme for all European children. Both boys and girls should be taught extensively about food and made aware of its healthy benefit as well as how to prepare certain dishes. Enhanced cultural awareness would also compel restaurants to raise their standards. If one pays, and certainly prices are not going down, one is entitled to a good and healthy meal. The inexorable laws of the market would then compel everyone in the trade to increase their standards. I have come a long way from pineapple pizza. I would, however, like to add a final thought. Increasing integration in our continent is in the interest of all European nations. But integration does not mean homogenisation. Our national cultures are our collective wealth and we must strive to preserve them in all their aspects. This includes food.","Id":"lifeandstyle/2004/mar/03/foodanddrink.shopping1","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webTitle":"Pineapple pizza to go?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2004/mar/03/foodanddrink.shopping1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2004/mar/03/foodanddrink.shopping1","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":1269,"webPublicationDate":"2004-03-03T02:45:13Z","id":"lifeandstyle/2004/mar/03/foodanddrink.shopping1","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Saddle of Vespa all'Italiana","body":"Eating Up Italy: Voyages on a Vespa Matthew Fort 320pp, Fourth Estate, £16.99 Garlic and Oil: Food and Politics in Italy Carol Helstosky 288pp, Berg, £18.99 We know very little about Italian food, as Matthew Fort's entertaining study shows. What has come through to us has been beautified, pared down and made into either fast food or very expensive and posh \"slow food\". Fort's hilarious gastronomic journey around Italy shows not just the variety of Italian food, but its deep connection with local and regional traditions. The survival, under pressure, of this incredibly rich and complicated series of diets - there is no such thing as Italian food, just as there is no such thing as Italy - is one of the wonders of the modern world. There are many refreshing things about Eating Up Italy. One is the studied avoidance of everything that is cliched about Italy's image abroad. On Fort's map of his travels, there is a huge gap in the centre-west of Italy. He doesn't go anywhere near Florence. No Tuscany, no Umbria, no Liguria, no Rome - the four places most visited by the English. Light years from Under the Tuscan Sun, Fort's vision is much more In the Calabrian Driving Rain. Another refreshing feature is the de-romanticisation of the country. Large parts of Italy are ugly, badly developed, covered with half-built illegal housing or hideous advertising signs. And you can eat badly, very badly. In one hotel in Calabria the food consisted, in part, of \"a huge round of something unidentifiable, which reminded me of the watery, claggy scrambled egg we had at school\". Later, after a series of fantastic hits, he has another miss, near Mantua. \"I proceeded to eat one of the nastiest meals I had had in a long time ... [including] a chicken leg of Frankensteinian proportions swimming in grease, which managed to be both tasteless and dry, in spite of the grease.\" What was different about these experiences, however, was that they were the exception and very much not the rule. One of the nicest traditions in Italian cuisine is the tendency to offer customers the freshest food available. Restaurants often simply do not have menus. They will bring you what they have, perhaps giving you a choice between two or three dishes. In one restaurant, again in Calabria, this conversation took place between the writer and a waiter. \"Antipastacarneopesce?\" said the young man briskly. \"Eh?\" I said. \"Antipastacarneopesce?\" he repeated. \"Oh, si.\" I said. \"Carne o pesce?\" he said with a touch of asperity. \"Oh, carne. Definitely carne,\" I said. \"Vino?\" \"Si, si.\" He whisked away. Fort is then assailed by no less than four pasta courses plus pudding. \"I didn't exactly leap into the saddle after that.\" Saddle? Was Fort making his journey on a horse? His choice was far more Italian. He made the journey by Vespa; the first part on a 50cc model, which chugged along nicely through the south, the second on a sleek 125cc which drew a series of admiring comments. Riding slowly, and stopping frequently for naps in orchards, Fort guides us up Italy. On his way, he explains the origins and contexts of the food he eats, while never overdoing the history, politics or sociology. It is elegantly woven together, supported by mouth-watering recipes. This is not a conventional guide book (we are not meant to revisit the restaurants or even places Fort goes to) but it is an invitation to see and taste Italy in a different light. The book is also very funny. My favourite episode is what Fort calls \"the most hallucinatory and terrifying period of my life\" - a scooter trip inside Naples. \"Traffic roared, leaped, hooted, tooted, peeled away, converged, moved in all directions at once with terrible intensity ... the traffic lights were for decoration ... to be gone through, whatever their colour, pushed through, shimmied through, got through by guile or brute force.\" Fort is unimpressed with Naples's gastronomic symbol - the pizza - preferring \"lunch in a tiny trattoria ... so ramshackle, it looked as if it were about to fall down\". He looks to understand the various regional specialisations, talking to a pepperoni expert and the founder of the country's \"slow food\" movement, among others. All this is complemented by an excellent series of black-and-white photographs. What emerges is a mosaic of regional and inter-regional diets under threat, but surviving and even renewing themselves, in a globalised world where the rural way of life will soon be something of the distant past. Some of the deeper answers to questions concerning the relationship between diet, Italians, food and the state might have been developed in Carol Helstosky's Garlic and Oil. Unfortunately, the book does not live up to its billing as \"the first comprehensive history of food habits in modern Italy\". There is very little here on the 1950s, when most Italians - for the first time -could afford to consume items that were not necessary for survival, and the focus of the book is fascism (20 years out of Italy's 144). Helstosky seems confused about what kind of diet Italy has, or has had. She ignores the incredible variety of cuisine, born from a combination of geographical features (mountains, lakes, hills, rice fields) and cultural exchange - the influence of successive waves of invasion, immigration and domination. She even makes the extraordinary claim that \"a rocky terrain covers much of the peninsula\", more or less ignoring the Po Valley - the country's economic and agricultural powerhouse. Although the book is packed with fascinating insights - the role of Italian emigrants, the attempts by fascism to impose dietary norms - not enough is tested in the real world of family life. Too many general statistics are produced and very little is given about actual cooking and eating habits. The world of the sharecropper, which dominated large parts of central Italy right up to the 1950s, is ignored. Fascism tried to shape national eating habits; whether it succeeded is another matter, and the mosaic of food production and consumption which survives suggests it did not. Helstosky's claim that \"in the decades after 1945, Italian consumers struggled to define and preserve the traditions and food considered characteristically Italian\" is followed on the same page by \"throughout the 1950s, however, Italians turned to food as a way of understanding regional traditions and folklore\". But wasn't food an integral part of those \"regional traditions and folklore\"? Moreover, Italians - supposedly the subject of this book - never really make an appearance, except grouped together as statistics. A final chapter on \"Food in Italy today\" is rather tacked on, and not without errors. · John Foot is reader in modern Italian history, department of Italian, University College London.","Id":"books/2004/jul/31/featuresreviews.guardianreview4","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Review: Eating Up Italy and Garlic and Oil: Food and Politics in Italy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/31/featuresreviews.guardianreview4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2004/jul/31/featuresreviews.guardianreview4","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts","wordcount":1129,"webPublicationDate":"2004-07-30T23:43:10Z","id":"books/2004/jul/31/featuresreviews.guardianreview4","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"England make statement of glorious intent","body":"There was no golden trophy to collect but, in a way, England will derive as much professional pride from yesterday's Roman romp as they did from their monumental triumph in Sydney last November. To kick off their Six Nations campaign with seven tries away from home against a lively Italian side is a decent start and a hat-trick by Jason Robinson left a vivid imprint on England's blank post-World Cup canvas. Even without one or two of their old masters, it was also a display which hinted that this group of men have fresh grand designs. Despite the absence of Jonny Wilkinson and Martin Johnson, Sir Clive Woodward must already suspect he is on the right lines. Stiffer tests lie ahead but most areas of Woodward's reshuffled team merited a thumbs-up. Paul Grayson slipped smoothly into Wilkinson's navigational role and Lawrence Dallaglio, on his return as captain, did his utmost to fill Johnson's inspirational boots. By full-time there was even a try for Sale's debutant forward Chris Jones but it was Robinson, his club colleague, who sparkled brightest in the Roman gloaming. When asked for his advice on the best way to stop England, Italy's coach John Kirwan said: \"Possibly a bazooka.\" While Italy's defence these days is no longer thinner than the average Roman pizza crust, it makes little difference when Robinson is in this kind of slicing form. Between the 23rd and 65th minutes he got hold of the ball in space on three occasions and cut through to score each time like a knife through buffalo mozzarella. It was an eloquent response to those who had queried his positional switch to outside-centre. When Robinson is running at flat-footed opponents, of course, it matters not what number he has on his back and his first try in particular was a gem. Having fielded a high ball himself on his own 22 he scurried right and fed Josh Lewsey, who made headway up the right touchline before hooking an overhead return ball back to Robinson. In theory the Italian fly-half Rima Wakarua had his man lined up, only to be skinned comprehensively as the Sale flier skipped away down the outside to score. By the time the 29-year-old Robinson trotted back having scored his second shortly before half-time England had the game in their pockets at 26-9, having expertly soaked up Italy's resourceful early pressure and shown the first glimmer of what was to come when Iain Balshaw dummied his way over on the left after 16 minutes. Even when Italy moved the ball intelligently, which was relatively often, the white defensive screen operated even tighter to the offside line than usual, with a pincer-like configuration making life even harder wide out. Only once, when the talented Sergio Parisse broke clear early in the second half, did a try look probable but the young No8 ignored Denis Dallan outside him and was cut down by Andy Gomarsall. Instead England, looking to maintain their average of 55 points a game against Italy over the past three years, struck again in the 58th minute when Gomarsall switched play left at a ruck and Lewsey, whose Test career was revitalised against Italy last year, dummied his way over. It was another reminder that, while England's so-called new \"back four\" may not be long-ball kicking specialists, they can certainly play. Like all clever predators Woodward's team have worked out new points of attack and the Robinson experiment, defensively risky or not, looks set to continue. Once upon a time England were dismissed as one- dimensional Robocops. Here, yet again, they showed how radically their game has changed and the neat interplay on the left between Ben Cohen and Will Greenwood which put Robinson clear on a 30-metre sprint to the line merely underlined the point. If Grayson needed a kind bounce for the converted try, which boosted his personal haul to 20 points, it was also no more than the Northampton outside-half deserved after serving for so long in the role of faithful understudy to Wilkinson. Even the usual rash of late substitutions could not disrupt England's momentum and Jones showed good alertness to dive over in injury-time after Matt Dawson had hounded the Italian scrum-half Paul Griffen. One day soon, perhaps, the championship will embrace bonus points for teams who score four tries away from home. Woodward, though, was happy enough - \"We would have taken that result beforehand\" - and has no serious injuries to concern him before he announces this weekend's team for Murrayfield tomorrow. England had feared some post-World Cup rustiness; instead they have given a resounding Roman salute to their pursuers.

Milan and Rome derby clashes are among the classics of the Italian and European fixture list. But Messina and Palermo have never met in the top flight and the last time two Sicilian teams fought for pride in Serie A was in 1965 when Catania beat Messina 4-2. The game in Messina will be only the ninth occasion when two Sicily teams have competed against each other in the top flight - a reflection of the failure of the three major clubs to maintain a sustained presence in Serie A. Football is not the only area of Italian life which has largely passed Sicily by over the decades - it has long been one of the most economically underdeveloped parts of the country, a status that has only recently begun to change. That was emphasised this week when work on the last tunnel of the motorway linking Palermo and Messina was completed. Construction of the 113-mile link began in 1969 and it should be ready in time to allow Messina fans to travel to Palermo for the return game in the spring. Sicily has produced many top-class footballers but they made their name far from the island - usually at Juventus. In the late 1960s and early 1970s the Sicilian striker Pietro Anastasi was a regular for Juve and Italy. Giuseppe Furino was a key part of the Juventus midfield in the early 1980s during the successful reign of Giovanni Trapattoni. The best known was Juventus's striker Salvatore \"Toto\" Schillaci, who was born in Palermo and played for Messina before starring for the Azzurri in the 1990 World Cup. Now, however, players are moving to the island to help the two clubs re-establish themselves at the highest level. The goals of the Milan-born striker Arturo Di Napoli and Riccardo Zampagna have helped Messina to fifth place, with victories over Roma and Milan. Palermo's return has been less spectacular but they are holding their own in 16th place and their striker Luca Toni has earned a place in Marcello Lippi's Italy squad. Messina start as favourites today and Di Napoli is an example of the great team spirit that has helped them to surpass all expectations so far. The forward promised to buy dinner for all his teammates if he scored the winner at Bologna on Sunday and although his goal contributed only to a 2-2 draw he still paid up for a pizza-and-beer supper. He is offering more if he gets the vital goal against Palermo. \"Then I will pay for a proper fish dinner for the team and the staff at one of the best Sicilian restaurants,\" he said. \"Maybe even one in Palermo.\"","Id":"football/2004/nov/11/newsstory.sport7","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webTitle":"Derby clash symbolises Sicilian renaissance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/nov/11/newsstory.sport7","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2004/nov/11/newsstory.sport7","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport","wordcount":483,"webPublicationDate":"2004-11-11T01:01:57Z","id":"football/2004/nov/11/newsstory.sport7","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Follow the experts","body":"Andy Cook Founder, takethefamily.com and father of Patrick, 5 and Joe, 3 Favourite destination: South Devon. A good old-fashioned British bucket-and-spade holiday is still hard to beat. Stay in a cosy cottage or a classic family-friendly hotel. Best of all, there's no jet lag. And plenty of cream teas. Favourite place to stay in the UK: The Luxury Family Hotels group (luxuryfamilyhotels.com) stands out because it focuses totally on the needs of families and does it with a much-needed touch of luxury for parents. The latest, the Ickworth Hotel (01284 735350, £200 per deluxe room - big enough for two adults and two kids - half-board) is also the grandest. Bedruthan Steps in Cornwall (01637 860555, bedruthan.com; from £67 per adult, half-board, children £11-£44.89, depending on age, sharing a room) or Polmaily House near Loch Ness (01456 450343, polmaily.co.uk; a three-night package costs £565 half-board, including activities, for two adults and two children in a family suite) are also firm favourites. And abroad: La Casella, Umbria (0039 763 86684, lacasella.com, £66 per adult, £40 per child, peak season, half-board) has 32 rooms in four renovated farmhouses, spread over a 1,000 acre estate.

What do you always take? Plenty of patience and a sense of humour. If that fails, the latest portable DVD plus a selection of hit movies. The new Bébétel (a baby listener that links through to your mobile) is a clever addition if you have babies or toddlers. Top tip: Wrap little token presents for kids to open at hourly intervals on a long flight. Spend as little as possible but take as many as possible. It's indulgent, but when you're somewhere over Russia with seven hours to go, they're a godsend. Helen Truszkowski Consultant for the Take The Kids book series (Cadogan) and mother of George, 9 Favourite destination: The US for its high levels of service, dynamic attitude and friendliness. I favour NYC and New York State, southern Florida, the California coastline and Jackson Hole, Wyoming (my particular favourite family ski destination).

It has beautiful white beaches, dolphins, self-hire boats to tiny islands such as Cabbage Key, mangrove canoe trips at Ding Darling Wildlife Refuge, bicycle hire and obscure little restaurants serving neon-pink cake and blue bubble-gum ice cream. What do you always take? A personal cassette player with pre-recorded story or music tapes always goes down well, as does dishing out a disposable camera for a kid's eye view of the trip. Top tip : The key to a successful kid's club holiday is asking plenty of questions before you book. These should include: What kind of supervised activities are there for my children's age group? What do they include? Do some activities or excursions cost extra? Are all your staff trained? (They should be at least l8 and have at least two years' experience working with children.) What happens at meal times? Can we drop in and out of club to suit our own daily schedule? Do you have a pool with a shallow end or separate toddler's pool? Are there lifeguards on duty? Is the pool enclosed? Debi Green Director of Babygoes2.com and mother of Roman, 6 Favourite destination: Sardinia, east coast around Cala Capra - just north of the Costa Smeralda. Turquoise water, unspoilt pink-tinged sandy beaches with rockpools, naturally shaded by pines, backed by steep maquis-covered cliffs. Excellent family-friendly restaurants and a wide variety of accommodation from simple self-catering apartments to luxury hotels. Boat trips to the Maddelena islands, various small towns close by.

Top tip: Take a flight survival pack for toddlers with small toys/things to do/treats. For older children take a waterproof disposable camera plus a scrapbook to make a holiday journal. Kate Calvert Editor of family-travel.co.uk and mother of Sarah, 9 and Conrad, 3 Favourite destination: Italy. Dedicated services for children are rare, but Italians tolerate any amount of bad behaviour from children. We've enjoyed agriturismi in Tuscany and Umbria but also Puglia, Sicily and more. With pizza and pasta the food is child friendly, and there are snippets of culture everywhere, so we parents get a bit of mental stimulation. Favourite place to stay in the UK: Hotel Tresanton in St Mawes, (01326 270055, tresanton.com, from £265 for a family suite, B&B) which is child friendly while retaining a real sense of adult style. Among hotels dedicated to families, I'd pick Fowey Hall in Fowey (01726 833866, foweyhall.com, from £190 per room, half-board, children's meals extra) which has all the childcare stuff, lovely open fires, and Fowey itself to explore. For self-catering, Landmark Trust properties (01628 825925, landmarktrust.co.uk) are a great way of letting children experience history firsthand. And abroad: There are lots of agriturismi initiatives in Italy but at the organic Fattoria Il Cerreto in Tuscany (ilcerreto.it, apartments from €488 per week) there is even a bio swimming pool, and the family has four children of their own who play with all the visitors. The Touring Club of Italy publishes Agriturismo: The Guide To Farm Holidays In Italy, £9.95. Best family holiday ever: Morocco - having a child with us humanised us to local people, and opened doors. Completely different but also real fun was a trip to Stockholm which is a lovely city that has thought carefully about how to cater for children. What do you always take? A nailbrush to scrub off clothing stains so we can pack light. Top tip: Find a book that tells the children something about the place they'll be visiting so they can experience that tick of recognition adults feel when they see famous places. The Madeline series by Ludwig Bemelmans (published by Scholastic) is good for little ones going to Paris; the Caroline Lawrence detective stories (The Roman Mysteries, Orion) for older children visiting Rome. · All prices are low season unless stated","Id":"travel/2005/feb/19/familyholidays.family.guardiansaturdaytravelsection2","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webTitle":"Follow the experts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2005/feb/19/familyholidays.family.guardiansaturdaytravelsection2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2005/feb/19/familyholidays.family.guardiansaturdaytravelsection2","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":1427,"webPublicationDate":"2005-02-19T19:28:43Z","id":"travel/2005/feb/19/familyholidays.family.guardiansaturdaytravelsection2","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"An Englishman's home is his casa as thousands go south","body":"The white Andalucian sun beats down on the red earth of the fields, on the dusty grey-green leaves of olive trees, on the white-walled churches - and on Mark Thompson, 34, a builder from Newcastle who has just unlocked the door to his new home.

With its cobbled streets, shuttered houses, tractors and old ladies in black sitting on stools in the shade, it is very much the campo, not the Costa del Sol. Yet it, and Thompson, are part of a massive new wave of immigration that is putting tens of thousands of young Britons - and often their families - into villages in remote parts of Spain. Thompson, tattooed and sunburnt, expects to be joined by his partner and 13-year-old daughter soon. The days when it was just the old hoping to soak up the sun or criminals on the run who headed for Spain are gone. The most recent official figures list 208,523 foreign residents in Andalucia, of whom the vast majority are British, double the total of five years ago. Most of the new arrivals are between 30 and 50. Because only a fraction of immigrants register with local authorities, the true number of Britons heading to Spain to live is thought to be much, much higher. According to Foreign Office estimates, there are now more than 675,000 UK citizens living in the country, mainly along the southern and eastern Mediterranean coasts, and new tax laws that allow higher tax earners to buy second homes as part of their pensions, to come into force next April, coupled with a rapid expansion in cheap flights, are thought likely to spur a new flood of migrants. In and around Malaga, heartland of the Costa del Sol, the local English-language paper, Sur in English, has increased its print run to 60,000 - and sells out. Once the newspaper was just read on the coast. Now, according to Liz Parry, the editor, copies are trucked far inland 'to the oddest places in the back of beyond'. The profile of the readers has changed, dropping about 20 years in age. The paper is full of ideas of things to do with children. In some areas, the newcomers have been welcomed for bringing life to agricultural communities that have become stripped of young people and economic activity. In others, the influx has led to social tensions, anger and massive pressure on space and resources. There are few complaints in the village of Comares, high in the hills behind Malaga. There the 425 registered foreigners are credited with keeping the village alive. 'So many people were leaving that the school was half empty. Now all the classrooms are full,' said Inmaculada Gutierrez, an assistant to the mayor. In the village of Arboleas, a three-hour drive into the mountains from Malaga, the story is the same. British immigrants make up a quarter of pupils at the school. Carl Shears, a 40-year-old former manager for a fitness company in the UK who moved in 18 months ago, said that the newcomers had 'reinvented the lives of people here. This is rural Spain. All the young people were leaving. They had the TV and internet and suddenly farming olives didn't seem so attractive any more'. Neither are many newcomers as insular as previous migrants. Felipe Plaza Cabrera, an architect in Alhaurin, said that even in his own conservative town the newcomers had fitted in well. In nearby Competa, Maria Kupers, a long-term Dutch-born resident, said that if it wasn't for the new arrivals', mainly between 30 and 50, the village would have 'died' and its cultural traditions with it. 'It's foreigners who have set up art exhibitions, opened pottery and ceramics shops, organised concerts and music nights in the bars,' said Kupers, who has been elected to the district council. Yet the huge influx has not always been so well received. In La Viñuela valley, 50 miles northeast of Malaga, the population has risen by a factor of eight or nine in the past five years, according to a local resident. Hundreds of new houses, many built illegally, perch on pristine hillsides above a beautiful lake. Some have been built carefully with due concern for local style, providing much-needed employment and boosting the local economy, but others have been constructed with little respect for the environment. And among the new permanent inhabitants are those who show no interest in integrating. These are dubbed the 'por favores' because, despite living in Spain for years, their language skills run to por favor, but little more - if indeed they bother to say 'please' at all. In one village a group of five British families has recently angered Spanish neighbours by drinking, brawling and swearing in the streets. 'The atmosphere there is very bad,' a resident said. 'The British are not welcome any more.' Another local described how the fiesta, where traditionally the local town hall provides free wine, beer and paella, had been overrun by 'British men in their fifties getting plastered'. One problem has been a shortage of water, caused both by the recent drought and the huge demands of the new housing developments with golf courses and swimming pools. And corruption in local councils has meant that many homes owned by the British are built on protected land. Last week dozens of UK homeowners in Alicante on the Costa Blanca were told that their houses might be demolished and a crackdown in the summer on the Costa del Sol has led to 73 arrests and the demolition of scores of properties. In one small district alone, nearly 3,000 cases are being investigated and a long-running investigation into an alleged money-laundering scheme has led to further problems for some homeowners in the Marbella area. The pressure on schools reveals the nature of both the por favores - and their more culturally open counterparts. Previously, British migrants would sell up in the UK, buy in Spain and have enough left over to put children into fee-paying international schools, said Eve Browne, advertising manager of Sur in English. 'Often you end up with the children being perfectly integrated, speaking fluent Spanish, while the parents know nothing.' There is also pressure on local health systems. 'No one goes home now to be treated by the NHS,' said another resident. Many new migrants are driven out of the UK by property prices. Thompson, Palenciana's newest arrival, said he simply could not afford Britain any longer. He paid £70,000 for his new dwelling, a shell of a small townhouse that has been used as a warehouse. 'Even in Newcastle you can't buy a decent property for that any more,' he said. 'The views are fantastic, there are 320 days of sunshine, schools and everything. It makes sense.' But he revealed other reasons for leaving the UK, widely shared among the expatriate community: 'England just is not English any more.' Thomson picked up the keys for his house from the Inland Andalucia estate agency in the small market town of Mollina. The agency, according to Amelia Chacon, the manager, concludes two or three sales or long-term lets every day. Mollina itself, despite its relatively isolated location, has a thriving British community, some of whom live in a large trailer park on the outskirts of the town. The new immigrants are served by several bars, a shop selling English newspapers and books, a Chinese takeaway and an Indian restaurant. Many appear dedicated to preserving a bizarre vision of a 'Britain of yesteryear', one with no crime, cheap property - and no one who is not white. In one Mollina bar, late one afternoon last week, as the Spanish owner served Britons with beers at just over €1 (66p) a glass, Raymond Timms said how he and his wife had sold up in Devon. They had arrived in Spain a week previously to take possession of a nearby house. 'I am not racist ...' began Timms, 62, before correcting himself. 'Actually I am racist. Britain has gone to the dogs. There's just too many foreigners. They're all coming in from Somalia, Czechoslovakia and Bangladesh. It's all wrong.' 'There are so many immigrants, it's black Britain now,' said Jay, his Irish-born 52-year-old wife. What is clear is that more and more Britons are heading for Spain. Property developers talk of a 20 per cent year-on-year rise for the foreseeable future - with prices rising even faster. As for Thompson, he is determined to make a success of life in Spain and to integrate as much as he can. He bought a Teach Yourself Spanish course before leaving Britain. 'You've got to learn the language,' he said. 'As they say, when in Rome, do as the Romans do.' · Additional reporting by Claire Munoz Parry Where are we heading?

Plates cluttering the table overflow with the thinnest strips of prosciutto, chunks of mature pecorino to dip in pale honey and crostini decorated with chicken liver paté. After the antipasti comes the primo piatto: a thick, long spaghetti, once favoured by the poor because it is made with flour and water rather than egg, called pici which is served with a sauce of field mushrooms, garlic and plenty of herbs. A bottle of thick, dark green extra virgin olive oil so spicy it burns the back of the throat sits alongside a pitcher of robust red wine. Yet we are not at London's River Café but on a farm in deepest Tuscany. This is the freshest, simplest, most authentic Italian food and it costs barely £10 a head for more than anyone could eat. It is served by Giovanni and Onelia in what was once just a working farm but is now also an agriturismo - a farm that rents out apartments for as little as £250 a week and offers its guests a chance to taste everything it cultivates. Giovanni and Onelia have spent most of their lives on this farm. Both in their seventies, they are contadini - peasant farmers - who have suffered from the recession in farming but who are making the best of what they have. There are around 11,000 agriturismi in Italy and more are appearing all the time; unsurprisingly, given its continuing popularity as a tourist destination, 25 per cent of the money generated comes from Tuscany. Many lie in the countryside outside Florence and Siena, but here in the lush, verdant Val d'Orcia deep in the south, there are dozens of agriturismi signs poking out of hedgerows. And there is no more authentic way to experience Italy and its food at an affordable price. After the long, relaxed lunch, Giovanni and Onelia show me around the farm. It has been Agriturismo San Giovanni for the past eight years but it still feels like a farm and the couple still look like contadini. Giovanni has an athletic build, wears heavy boots and a blue and white shirt tucked into turned-up denim jeans; Onelia wears a faded apron round her calf-length skirt. While Giovanni works the land, Onelia takes control of the food, cooking lunch or dinner for guests on request and serving it under shaded pergolas next to the swimming pool. Nearly all the food Onelia makes comes from the farm. The only thing she buys from outside is bread. There seem to be endless dark, cool rooms crowded with food and drink - the couple insist it's all organic and despite having no stamp of approval from an official body, it probably is in the old-fashioned sense. Most importantly, perhaps, it's as fresh and local as possible. Onelia pulls a chunk of pizza di Pasqua from a huge freezer and explains how the Easter treat is made from egg, parmesan, two different types of pecorino (sheep's milk cheese), oil, salt and pepper before being cooked in the old wood-fired oven built into the side of one of the buildings. There are frozen chunks of shoulder, rib and leg that used to belong to sheep and pigs alongside bags of strongly scented mushrooms. We had some of these for lunch with the pici, but Onelia has other ambitions for them too: 'I am waiting for the tomatoes to ripen in August to make a sauce for tagliatelle.' Another room is dedicated to last year's crop of tomatoes. Row upon row of jars are filled with what Onelia proudly calls pomodori naturali: tomatoes so pure they were simply boiled for 45 minutes, skinned and stored in jars until needed for a simple sauce ('I just cook them up with onion, garlic, salt, basil and parsley') or perhaps for a ragu di carne. While Onelia wanders off to attend to some kitchen duties, Giovanni continues the tour. The contents of these rooms is so varied, of such a high quality, that I wonder if they are hiding a secret work force. There is prosciutto from last year hanging from a ceiling to dry-cure while 2003's batch sits on a wooden table with a basket of bread ready to make panini. There is a vat of the young extra virgin olive oil we had for lunch - one of the best I have ever tasted - not to mention the unusually sweet but still lethal grappa al limone, the light, aromatic vin santo and the tart red wine with a little bit of a Lambrusco-style fizz because it's so young, barely a year old. The 2003 version has settled and is a rich, full-bodied table wine. Nothing has a label - everything is served up in recycled wine bottles. I am feeling a little overwhelmed by all these rooms - I haven't even mentioned the home-made cherry and peach jams, or the onions and garlic hanging from the garage ceiling to dry - when Giovanni leads the way to the orto, the vegetable garden. It is dense with artichokes, tomatoes, garlic, broad beans, peas, lettuce, rocket and more. Next to the woodpile sits a large coop with a few dozen hens and turkeys. Giovanni explains how the farm has been in his family since the end of the 18th century and he has lovingly restored the buildings himself. He shows me around the three immaculate apartments. Grasping my arm, he points at the beams, the tables, the beds and smiles: he made everything himself and all the wood, every last bit, came from the farm. He stops at a faded black-and-white photo taken at the turn of the last century: 'My grandparents,' he explains proudly. 'All the sacrifices my grandmother made to keep this land. She barely had a lira when she started, and after four years she managed to buy this building we're standing in that was once the farmhouse. She sweated all those years ago and I am still sweating...' As the afternoon sun becomes more intense, we sit down to talk in the shade under one of the pergolas. Giovanni finds it hard to sit still for too long. He jumps up, disappears, returns armed with wine, vin santo and a stack of plastic cups. 'Go on!' he implores. 'Enjoy yourself!' Giovanni tells his story with passion. 'This land was split between my mother and one of her sisters. Unfortunately, my mother died. I had a good herd of cows going for a while but the milk prices were getting lower. I was aware that you could get a grant from the government to start an agriturismo ... in the end, it was the only option.' He shrugs, sighs. 'I have to stress that it's only part of our income; we still grow sunflowers, olives, grapes. In other words, all the things we had before, apart from the cattle. We have had to make a lot of sacrifices. Many, many sacrifices. But it's becoming easier. Apart from the fact that we still have to pay tax. Out of every €100 we make, we have to give 10 to the state. And everyone who stays has to have a proper bill...' Franco Fani, who runs an annual agriturismo fair in Arezzo in the heart of Tuscany, says that it's often a difficult transition for farmers to make. An authentic agriturismo has to make the bulk of its profits from agriculture rather than tourism - a tough call when a considerable amount of time has to be invested in actually learning how adapt to a new life. 'They were born as field workers, not hotel workers. Suddenly they have to deal with bookings,people, cooking for guests, websites and, of course, other languages. Perhaps the wife and grandmother will cook while the son or daughter will go to university to study a language and learn how to build a website.' Not all agriturismi serve food - some offer a simple breakfast, a few expect guests to be completely self-catering - but those that do are supposed to follow certain guidelines. 'The food has to come from the farm itself or the local area,' says Fani. 'Preferably it is organic. Guests are always keen to try local specialities, so there is some pressure to offer local dishes too.' While showing me her jars of tomatoes, Onelia made a joke about some agriturismi being less than authentic. 'If you go into some kitchens, you will find them full of supermarket shopping bags. They don't always follow the rules.' Giovanni is also resentful of the fact that he has to compete with numerous bigger agriturismi, which he dismisses as hotels. He is referring to places like Il Poggio, an agriturismo in nearby Celle sul Rigo. Il Poggio is in a breathtaking setting high up on a hillside and offers an unusual mix of self-catering apartments and a smart restaurant with professional chefs that is open to the public. Facilities include horse-trekking and two swimming pools. In some ways it is like a hotel, but the principles remain the same as other agriturismi: all the buildings were once farmhouses or outbuildings while most of the food served in the restaurant is from the farm. Enrica Bartolini Gori and her husband Roberto, who own Il Poggio, grew up in neighbouring farms in Celle sul Rigo, which had been in both families for generations. In 1987 Enrica and Roberto decided to start a small agriturismo to satisfy her passion for horses and his love of farming and food. They had just eight rooms and a communal living room, Enrica's sister gave a hand in the kitchen and most of the guests were Italian. By 1996, the restaurant was as much a focal point of Il Poggio as the horses and it also opened to non-residents. 'We continued to offer la cucina territoriale, local cooking,' explains Enrica. 'We make all the pasta by hand, we have our own pigs and buy lamb or veal locally. We have a lot of our own vegetables, our own extra virgin olive oil and we recently bought a small vineyard, so produce our own table wine.' Compared to Agriturismo San Giovanni, the restaurant is far more formal and things seem to be done officially: the farm boasts proper organic certification. The food is more ambitious - a typical plate of pici with zucchini flowers, truffle and guinea fowl is beautifully presented - but it's still not too expensive and is defined more than anything by being good and local. Enrica says that if the restaurant wasn't open all year round to the public, they would struggle to survive. In the quieter months they know locals will make up the numbers. And survival is all: these agriturismi have to make it work however they can. Driving around southern Tuscany, I talked to other owners, all of whom said the same thing: renting out rooms ensured they could continue farming. Stefano Stefani, a good-looking young contadino who runs a simple place called Il Caio just along the road from San Giovani, is out strimming hedges late one aftnernoon. Hanging on the front door of his modest farmhouse is a roughly-hewn wooden sign with the message 'Siamo in campanga' ('we are in the fields') and a mobile number. Il Caio serves food to guests who are interested. 'Beef is the only meat we don't produce ourselves,' explains Stefano before he gets back to work. 'And we mostly use recipes that have been in my family for generations.' Further north, on the road from to Montepulciano, an old woman called Teresa Marrazzo runs Poggio Mori with her grown-up children. It is a vast farmhouse with stately home-sized communal rooms and a dozen bedrooms. Poggio Mori is at the lower end of the agriturismo market, run more like a YMCA than a hotel, but the most important thing is not the pool or the tennis courts. It is Signora Marrazzo's good rustic cooking. 'I've lived on this farm since 1978,' she explains. 'But we rebuilt and renovated it in 1992 to turn it into an agriturismo. There was so much space here and hardly any of it was being used. We weren't making enough money off the land and I knew I could cook, so it was a good start.' As her son and daughter hose down the patio in preparation for the tourist season, she looks proud but a little sad. 'There has been too much sacrifice in my life. It's not easy living on a farm and watching it slowly deteriorate. But now we have another life.' The rapid decline of farming and the rise of agriturismi has thrown a lifeline to contadini - but it has also created an incredible network of places for tourists to stay. And for those who have romantic notions about Italy, who want to taste the food as it was generations ago, who want to experience the countryside before it was taken over by machines, there is no better place to stay. Back with Giovanni and Onelia, Giovanni tells me he is up at five every morning and often works till midnight. Although the tourist side of the business is hard, he obviously finds it rewarding too. When he works the fields, he says, there are lots of stones and the earth can be unyielding. When he sits down to eat with guests, it can be more relaxing. Even when they speak no Italian, I ask. 'Yes!' he says, laughing. 'With food you need no language. This is old Italy. Food is all that matters.' · Amy Raphael travelled to Tuscany with Owners' Syndicate.

You must go and try.\" Well, the children's faces lit up. You see, up until now Lauren, 10, and Maddie, 5, had been somewhat wary of a non-beach holiday, in a land-locked region, surrounded by lots of farmland, olive groves, vineyards, crumbly old monuments and ancient hill-top villages, in a house bereft of room service and pay-per-view telly, hundreds of miles away from the nearest water park. Indeed, they had only warmed to the idea when I told them we'd have our own private pool. This latest news of local, epicurean confection, however, proved to be the clincher. They didn't need telling twice. As soon as our hosts had left, we piled into the rented Alfa Romeo and headed for town. Within a few minutes the kids' keen little noses were pushed against the recommended gelateria's glass cabinet, agonising over flavour choice: pale green melon or orange sorbet? Libidinously dark chocolate, nectarine, coconut or creamy yellow banana? Snow white vanilla striated with raspberry or marbled with coffee? What about the elegant sludge that is the bittersweet frozen trifle of Zuppa Inglese? As she licked her dripping cornet, Laurie did a quick calculation. We were going to be at the house for six days. There were around 24 flavours. If we visited the gelateria every day, between us we could sample every single one. This, she decided, there and then, in between big licks, was going to be a truly great holiday. My youngest nodded in agreement. We had heard a lot about Umbria from friends who painted a picture of the region as the thinking man's antidote to neighbouring Tuscany. Umbria, (sometimes, rather patronisingly, I think, dubbed \"Tuscany's Little Sister\"), is pensive, modest and insular, they said, where Tuscany is glamorous, ostentatious and full of English and Germans. Tuscany is macho and richly artistic where Umbria is gentle and deeply spiritual. Tuscany has Sting and Naomi Campbell. Umbria has St Francis of Assisi and St Benedict. You go to Tuscany to show-off, they said. You go to Umbria to hide. All well and good, we said, but will the kids like it? Well, if you ask me, kids will like pretty much anywhere in Italy, as long as they have the right house, a pool, easy access to a wood-fired pizza joint and a quality gelateria close by. And parents will be happy because, well, the Italians just love children. I know it's a well-worn travellers' cliche, but the Italians are far more kid-friendly than their neighbours. We know this because soon after our second daughter was born, we went on a summer trip that took in Cap Ferrat in the South of France and Sestri Levante on the Ligurian coast of Tuscany. On the snooty Côte d'Azur, we were treated like parental lepers, uptight maitre d's \"ne touch pas!\"-ing petulantly, sucking their teeth at every scream and upset glass of Fanta caused by our lively six-month-old baby and our five-year-old, irritated at our lack of unexperimental menu choices. Don't the French have children, we wondered? The sniffy French attitude to our sprogs made us paranoid and over-sensitive to the whims of other childless, peace-seeking residents around us. We would seek out semi-deserted cafes and nasty kiddie-centric diners and found it hard to relax as a consequence. The Italian leg of our trip couldn't have been more different. Such was the Italians' adoration of young ones, we found we could actually leave our sleeping baby in the charge of the smiling people under the neighbouring parasol while we wandered off to get a soda. In the evenings, we did the pushchair passeggiata thing well into the night, trawling the shops and cafes until midnight; we were welcomed into every cafe, shop and bar with our children whatever the hour. At one hill-top restaurant, the owner's wife took our baby in her arms and looked after her, and refused to put her down, even as she tended to other customers. When Maddie eventually ran out of gas, the staff made her up a little bed, adjacent to our table, so that she could sleep until we'd finished eating. We got the same welcome in Umbria. Of course, we were somewhat spoiled when it came to accommodation. Our house, Villa Sallicotta (with its large adjoining guest house), located pretty much equidistant from Rome and Florence (Umbria has no major airport of its own), just near the hill town of Montone and a 45-minute drive from Perugia, was just about ideal. Situated up on a hillside, with wide open views of far-reaching rolling farmland, it is an immaculate example of solid stonework and 18th-century, blue-chip rustic, all carefully appointed with shabby chic charm: a big dining table; a fireplace large enough to burn heretics on; a practical, country kitchen; a telly and a DVD player; and a pool. Best of all, it is a good half-mile away from the nearest neighbour. Forget hotels. As a parent of young children, you quickly learn that a hotel holiday finds you paying a massive premium to feel tense and uptight. Your hearing becomes tuned into the sound of your kids, your sensitivity heightened to their squealing, boisterous Anglo-Saxon behaviour (though in reality, it is no better or worse than the other kids'). When you have two children under 12 (and a couple of their equally shrill friends), this is what you want: a space where no one can hear them scream, a base from which a satellite of places of cultural and historical (or retail) interest can be visited in a series of half-day jaunts, children either coming along for the ride or staying poolside with the other parental group sharing the property. With a house (always a cheaper option than a hotel), you can dine in two shifts - kids going early, parents eating later, free to neck copious, guilt-free amounts of Barollo and gorge on lamb, porchetta and locally sourced mushrooms, while the children get stuck into Shrek on the DVD. Kindergarten responsibilities are undertaken by whichever adult happens to be lounging around at the time. No one cares if you leave wet towels on the floor. Now, that's what I call a family holiday. (I would, nevertheless, strongly advise against asking any childless adults along for the ride. They'd hate it.) So, can you do Umbrian culture with the kids? Well, if I'm perfectly honest, our house was so lovely and its pool so idyllic, we'd have probably never found out had we not had a couple of cool, cloudy days during our week away. Waiting for the sunshine to come back, we took trips to Assisi and Todi, buzzing, studenty Perugia and Gubbio (the most \"thoroughly medieval of all the Umbrian towns,\" said the guidebook). We did markets, churches and museums and took a lunch at Fattoria di Vibio (fattoria divibio.com), a truly wonderful farmhouse spa hotel an hour's drive away near Prodo Quadro. The only problem we encountered was this: everything in beautiful, peaceful, temperate, fascinating Umbria seems to have been positioned on a completely knackering, two-in-one, cobbled street or steep stepped, pedestrianised gradient. And when it comes to urban hill climbing, kids have the kind of stamina threshold of somewhere between around 10 and 20 paces. After that the hill street blues kick in and only the promise of another cold dollop of Zuppa Inglese will kick start them into action again. I reckon my kids' fuel consumption was approximately two scoops to every kilometre. On a near-vertical attempt of a hill which would take us to Perugia's Galleria Nazionale, with weather close and muggy, my youngest and less hardy daughter suddenly decided she'd had enough and went dead dog, coming to a full stop halfway up. Arms folded, legs buckling and bottom lip wobbling, she flatly refused to budge another step further. We were a good 100 yards ahead of her by the time we realised she had conked out, so we had to trudge back down the hill again to pick her up in a fireman's lift, Maddie screaming like a banshee as we climbed. No one batted an eye-lid. If they did notice, the Italians would just cock their heads sympathetically at her and try their best to help console our mewling brat. But it was no good. My kid was beat.

The prince, his wife Marina Doria and their son Emmanuel Filiberto will fly into a Naples military airport in a private plane today, for their second visit since parliament lifted the exile order on male members of the House of Savoy last year. But they are conspicuously bypassing Rome, adding to the consternation of the government, which has not had a courtesy visit by the prince since the exile order was lifted. The media report that the family will have red velvet armchairs in a penthouse suite and eat mini-mozzarellas and courgette flowers during their three-day visit, which will include appearances at Naples Cathedral and a local football match. A Neapolitan pizza chef has created a crown-shaped Savoy pizza in their honour. But not everyone is welcoming the exiles. \"The Savoys are not children, so I don't need to accompany them around the city holding their hands,\" the mayor, Rosa Russo, said. The city authorities have declined a €12,000 (£8,000) charity donation offered by the Savoys. Some members of the Italian aristocracy who believe the Duke of Aosta is the rightful heir to the throne have snubbed the visit, and anti-monarchist groups have distributed \"Savoys go back\" bumper stickers in Naples. Italians voted to abolish the monarchy in a referendum in 1946 and under the constitution they can still vote not to let the prince stay in Italy. Victor Emmanuel has renounced all claims to the throne, but he has applied to the European court of human rights at Strasbourg for an indemnity payment from the state. And the ownership of the crown jewels, locked in a safe in the Bank of Italy for the past half century, has yet to be resolved. The Savoys have made efforts to dismiss the public resentment of their role in Italian history, issuing a statement last year formally condemning Mussolini's race laws, which banned Jews from schools and public office at the beginning of the second world war. They said the laws, which were approved by the Savoys at the time, had left an indelible stain. But Victor Emmanuel has tainted the family image while in exile by dealing in arms on behalf of the Shah of Iran, and by accidentally shooting a German tourist on his yacht. He was tried and acquitted. His son Emmanuel Filiberto has developed a playboy reputation. And he appeared on Italian television last year advertising olives that make you \"feel like a king\". Ludina Barzini, an Italian journalist and expert in royal affairs, said: \"During the exile years the Savoys managed to keep up an aura of mystery. They made people dream. But now they are here, people may well be disappointed.\"","Id":"world/2003/mar/15/italy.sophiearie","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Exiled royals dip a toe in Italy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/15/italy.sophiearie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2003/mar/15/italy.sophiearie","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":479,"webPublicationDate":"2003-03-15T02:23:17Z","id":"world/2003/mar/15/italy.sophiearie","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Brassed off","body":"A year ago, in a small town in the hills east of Rome, a small ceremony got under way. Gianfranco Fini, deputy prime minister and leader of the \"post-fascist\" Alleanza Nazionale party, unveiled a monument in memory of Italy's defunct currency, the lira. Actor Sophia Loren helped him unveil the statue of liberty-style female figure, made of melted down lira coins, telling the crowd in the small town of Rieti that she \"missed\" the lira. Italy was probably the most ardent advocate of the euro, in the years running up to its introduction. The Italians had the weakest currency in Europe and were exhausted by its rollercoaster devaluation. When the euro arrived, many were mighty relieved to get rid of all the zeros on their banknotes. But, two years after the introduction of the new currency, increasing numbers of Italians feel the same way as Sophia Loren. Since the euro arrived, prices in Italy have shot up, as shopkeepers have \"rounded up\" their prices. Official figures say the price of a cappuccino in Rome has increased 12%, while the cost of a \"Margherita\" pizza has risen by 8%. But most Italians complain that, rather than \"rounding up\" prices, many shops have effectively \"doubled\" them. Mr Berlusconi has attempted to play down the euro alarm, saying that, overall, \"Italy is richer\". But a poll by independent research group Eurispes showed that 48.2% of Italians feel their economy is going downhill, compared to 32.5% last year. Eurispes says around 8 million Italians are living in poverty. Consumer groups have launched protest groups against the \"carovita\" (high cost of living), while women's magazines offer tips on how to save those vital euro cents. Mr Berlusconi has given a mixed message about the euro. Recently he agreed: \"It's absolutely true that the euro made prices increase.\" But he has also suggested that housewives have the power to stop the rise in prices, by shopping around for the best bargains. From next month, a special price police will begin patrolling Italy's shopping areas, monitoring prices. Lists of local prices will be posted in district post offices to help promote competition. Those charging more will be forced to pay more taxes. Meanwhile, Italians recognise that they are in part themselves to blame. After decades in which the coins in their pockets were worth virtually nothing, they find themselves giving euro coins away far too easily. \"I used to tip waiters a few hundred lire. Now I often leave them a few euros,\" said Fabio Lanieri, a taxi driver in Naples. \"It's hard to break old habits. But these coins are worth much more.\" Italy has been calling on the European Central Bank to introduce €1 notes, to try to help Italians think twice before parting with their money. Meanwhile, the euro has become an election issue. Romano Prodi, now European commission president, beat Berlusconi in 1996 elections and personally orchestrated Italy's entry into the euro. Prodi has recently launched his campaign to return to Italian politics at the end of this year and lead the Italian left against Berlusconi in 2006 general elections. Under pressure to explain the high consumer prices this week, the finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, suggested to journalists: \"Ask candidate Prodi about his bungled euro.\" Prodi has criticised the Berlusconi government for failing to monitor the euro properly since it was introduced. \"The euro is seen by so many Italians as a factor in impoverishment,\" said the Corriere della Sera this week, warning that anti-euro feelings could easily lead to anti-European ones. \"A responsible political class does not hide behind its problems, but it avoids using them as a club against its adversaries.\"","Id":"world/2004/feb/18/worlddispatch.italy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Brassed off","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/feb/18/worlddispatch.italy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2004/feb/18/worlddispatch.italy","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":610,"webPublicationDate":"2004-02-18T15:04:19Z","id":"world/2004/feb/18/worlddispatch.italy","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"I lost my heart in...

She may have lost her summer holiday on the Adriatic coast, but at least she will get a new car. Fiat Deutschland has announced that it plans to give her the first Lancia Ypsilon to roll off its production line. The gesture was one of several being brandished yesterday as Italian business executives strove desperately to repair the damage wreaked by two weeks of bitter, personalised confrontation with the richest nation in Europe. In Pesaro, the town where the Schröders were to have spent two weeks next month, thousands of notices were being put up to appease Germans insulted by the extraordinary insults hurled, first, by Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, and then by his Minister for Tourism, Stefano Stefani, who resigned late on Friday after finally being told he had to go. 'The German people are our brotherly friends,' said the posters. 'To vulgarly offend their feelings is also to offend our own.' Along the coast, around Rimini, local communists were distributing leaflets in German stressing to holidaymakers that the majority of people in the area, a traditional stronghold of the Left, did not vote either for Berlusconi's party or its ally, the Northern League, of which the former Tourism Minister is a member. As Italian restaurants in Germany reported a drop in trade and a poll found 16 per cent of Germans ready to forgo pizza and pasta for the sake of national self-respect, an Italian cosmetics chain put up notices in its shops dissociating itself from the Rome government's approach. 'Unfortunately,' said the company, 'we are governed by people who don't know what they're doing.' Europeans have become resigned to periodic, media-fuelled spats between the British and whichever continental nation has most recently offended the sensibilities of the tabloids. But never before has there been such a rumbustious stand-off between two countries that really are at the 'heart of Europe'. Berlusconi began it all at the European Parliament in Strasbourg on the second day of Italy's six-month EU presidency when, goaded by a German MEP, Martin Schulz, he told him that he would be 'perfect' for the role of concentration camp guard in a forthcoming movie. Then last weekend Stefani, who is perhaps significantly the divorced husband of a German, unleashed a stream of bile against Germans as 'stereotyped blonds with hyper-nationalistic pride' and against Germany as a country where IQ tests were 'necessary' and indeed 'indispensable'. Last Wednesday, faced with Berlusconi's failure to even criticise his subordinate, and very likely sensing an opportunity to boost his approval ratings, Schröder cancelled his family holiday. The Italian Prime Minister omitted even to express regret. All the while, newspapers in both countries were indulging in an orgy of nationalistic mockery. Bild Zeitung said Stefani had 'spaghetti for brains'. La Stampa published a front-page cartoon of Berlusconi urinating from a height on Schulz in a pickelhaube decorated with the hammer and sickle. Bild then hit back by parking topless models in deck chairs outside the Italian Embassy in Berlin to prove how 'sexy, beautiful and charming' Germans really were. The paper also published a glossary of phrases for those German tourists who persisted in holidaying in Italy. It included such edifying rejoinders as 'Take your greasy eyes off my wife'. The gloves were well and truly off. This extraordinary dispute was also a reminder that continental Europeans - no less than Britons - continue to harbour deeply held ethnic prejudices and historical resentments. Unlike the recent spats between Britain and France, the current row has no basis in policy differences. It arose out of almost nothing and gathered its momentum solely from national pride and racial stereotyping. Many of the Germans and Italians questioned by each other's journalists last week expressed dismay at the row and denied any animosity. But, as the philosopher-politician Massimo Cacciari put it in an article for La Repubblica, 'the link between Italy and Germany is very delicate... a slender thread of love and hate that is always on the point of snapping'. The Italians and Germans have been warring and parlaying alternately since the first Roman scout glimpsed the smoke from the first Germanic tribal settlement. It has left a weighty legacy of mixed feelings. For Germans, Italy is the warm south - a cheerful and colourful land directly below them that offers an escape from their own anxieties and alienation. Goethe no sooner reached Trento than he was feeling 'at home in the world, neither a stranger nor an exile'. Yet, lodged somewhere in the Lutheran left side of the German brain, there is also a contempt for Italy in general, and Rome in particular, as embodying qualities that are anathema to the German psyche: amorality, superficiality, insincerity and a capacity for subtle trickery which enrages the Germans so much because, I suspect, they are so vulnerable to it. In the German view, the Italians, who invented fascism but then changed sides during the Second World War, escaped their share of blame for what happened, and never submitted themselves to the kind of painful self-examination that the Germans themselves underwent in the late Sixties and early Seventies. But if Germans view Italians with a mixture of love and suspicion, then Italians in general view Germans with a blend of admiration and fear. From medieval times, the relationship has been an unequal one. There is scarcely an Italian town of any size that was not sacked by German troops during the centuries of wrangling between successive Popes and their nominal protectors, the (German) Holy Roman Emperors. More recently, the Italians suffered under a brutal Nazi occupation after their government's withdrawal from the Second World War. And there is contempt, too, in the Italian view of the Germans, whom they tend to see as hopelessly unstylish and uncouth. The two peoples are about as different as any two sets of Europeans. But if that is one reason for the inherent tension between them, then another is created by their similarities. Both nations that remained politically fractured until the latter half of the nineteenth century, Italy and Germany were ripe for seduction by the far-right demagogues who led them into the Second World War. Their reactions to the catastrophes that followed were predictably similar: a flight into political systems that were designed to avoid the re-emergence of a single mighty leader; systems that rewarded consensus, that took proportional representation to an extreme, and resulted in the creation of generous welfare states; systems which are today making it particularly difficult for Germans and Italians alike to get to grips with the challenges of the early twenty-first century. Both countries' 'economic miracles' are a thing of the past. In Germany, as in Italy, politicians are trying without notable success to push through economic reforms that are more needed than liked by their voters. The sense in both countries of under-achievement and disorientation may go some way towards explaining the sensitivities that surfaced last week - that, and the fact that, coincidentally or otherwise, both are led by politicians whose nationalism is still underestimated in the rest of Europe. Berlusconi heads a party he founded called 'Come on, Italy'. Schröder got himself re-elected last year by appealing to voters to back a new 'German way'. I have met and interviewed both and they are more alike than either would wish - superficially jovial, but prickly and pugnacious underneath. Last week's antics brought them head-to-head. I would be surprised if it was the last time.","Id":"world/2003/jul/13/italy.germany","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Focus: The spat between Italy and Germany","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/13/italy.germany","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2003/jul/13/italy.germany","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":1270,"webPublicationDate":"2003-07-13T00:04:08Z","id":"world/2003/jul/13/italy.germany","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Viva Las Vegas","body":"This year is the 100th birthday of Las Vegas. Like any spangly old tart, Las Vegas has grown more respectable with age - but she still has the energy to throw one big, shiny, banging birthday party. This town is going to turn 100 in style. She's going to get drunk, dress up and kick her heels till dawn. If you're picturing an old lady right now, picture the collagen-stuffed Jackie Stallone in Celebrity Big Brother. Picture Dolly Parton, still bewigged and rhinestoned at 58, explaining that ever since childhood she has yearned to dress like a hooker. That's the kind of old lady we're talking about. There's no such thing as too much noise or too much glitter. When you fly to Las Vegas at night, a blaze of multicoloured lights appears amid the yawning darkness of the desert. When you drive into town from California or the Grand Canyon, you pass through miles and miles of empty sand before ... bam! A wall of neon hits you in the face. Day and night the slots jangle, the cocktails flow, the buffets groan and the Hawaiian shirts clash, while the famous Strip is as dazzling and bustling and glaring and clinking and glittering as it ever was in the movies. In her early days, Las Vegas was a wild thing who ran with a bad crowd. She was born with the advent of the railroad through the Nevada desert, set up as a tent town for workers in May 1905. The baby Vegas soon sprouted saloons and boarding houses, much to the shock of her religious relatives (the Mormons, who until that point had been the only residents of the area). Gambling was actually banned in Nevada in 1910, but this was openly ignored by our little tearaway: underground gaming flourished in Las Vegas until the State Legislature relegalised it during the Great Depression to get their hands on tax revenue. There was a brief lull during the Second World War, but Las Vegas hit her thirties with a vengeance. By 1946, Bugsy Siegel (notorious member of Meyer Lansky's crime syndicate) had opened the Flamingo Hotel, the favourite watering hole of gangsters at the time, and by 1947 he'd been shot dead in his girlfriend's living room. Shiny new hotels were springing up everywhere, many of them mob-controlled. If it all sounds kinda glamorous and not very nasty at all, think again. Card-counters got their knees broken, rival casinos were burnt down, and black gamblers were not welcome. Black entertainers were banned from living on hotel premises and even black film and singing star Lena Horne wasn't allowed to enter the gaming area when performing at the Flamingo. That is where dizzying freedom hit its limit: no cover charges, no sales tax, no income tax, no waiting period for marriage licences, no gambling regulation ... and no negroes near my innocent wife, thank you. When people pine for the old days of Vegas, the edgy glamour of gangster culture and the pioneering spirit of the early players, they conveniently forget (or never knew) this grim aspect of the whole business. Sure the showgirls were great, the streets were thronged with society's rebels and Frank Sinatra was always in town - but any black person who applied to marry a white sweetheart was arrested immediately. I know how easy it is to be sentimental for days one never knew. I am guilty of it myself: I read Big Julie of Vegas (the memoirs of a Runyanesque racketeer from the early years) and imagine how cool it must have been. I look at the modern mega-resorts, each one raking in fat profits for a national hotel chain, and speculate that it may have been purer when money went out the back way into a local gangster's bejewelled hands. I see families coming into Las Vegas to enjoy the amusement rides, slapstick shows and kiddie restaurants laid on for mass appeal and I think 'Hey! This is meant to be a grown-ups ' Disneyland!' But in the end it's probably better this way. Las Vegas still retains a little shady cool from her gangster past, but this is a safe town now, and if not morally perfect it is certainly morally improved. The neon still glitters round the clock, the strippers still dance 24/7, the restaurants still serve dinner at 3am, but now it's open to everybody. And if they catch you card-counting at blackjack, they politely ask you to leave rather than taking you round the back with a baseball bat. It is glamour without horror. It is freedom without restriction. It is still utterly soulless. It is my favourite city in the world. I visited Las Vegas for the first time when I was 18, gambling and drinking with fake ID (you're supposed to be 21). There was a recession on, takings were down and nobody asked to check my passport. Now the casinos are booming again they demand to see my passport every time I go there. I'm 31: believe me, I'm delighted to be asked. I went back to Las Vegas three years later, having reached the legal age of 21, and loved it even more. I had learnt to play poker by then, and this town is a poker player's dream: games of every size and style going on around the clock. I won money. I got a suntan. I had a fling with a Texan Marxist (a social anomaly akin to finding a Cornish astronaut). My third time in Vegas was the happiest I'd ever been; and so was the fourth, and the fifth, and the sixth. They know their stuff, these Vegas hotel owners, and any imaginable indulgence is provided on tap. It's impossible to be bored in a town where (regardless of the hour) a show is always starting, a fairground ride is always open and the roulette wheel always spins. The freedom is absolute: free to play cards, free to have fun, free to get up in the afternoon and go back to bed in the morning. It's a holiday to the power of 10. In 2003 I had such an intensely perfect trip that I seriously thought about moving there to live. I still wish, sometimes, that I had never come back. In 2004 I went to Las Vegas with a broken heart. It was not a smart thing to do. This time, the only reason I came home again was that hotel windows don't open in Vegas because everybody wants to jump out. Well, everybody who's lost too much money, or has a broken heart. Vegas is an incredible town for lovers, and there is nowhere better to be truly alone, but for God's sake don't go there with your heart full of someone you're missing. Remember: soulless. Vegas is an easy place to feel like you want to live for ever, and an easy place to feel like you never want to wake up again. So: hotels! My favourite is Caesar's Palace. It is a riot of camp: a glorious recreation of ancient Rome, with crumbling pillars in the giant swimming pool and concierges dressed as senators. Many people say that the best hotel is the Bellagio (all marble, fresh flowers and hand-blown glass) but I find it a little too classy. If I want tasteful Italian style, I'll go to Italy. In Vegas I want kitsch at its most frighteningly lavish. Take the Venetian hotel-casino, a near-exact replica of Venice but about eight times bigger. It's the size of Russia. Everything is perfectly recreated except the very essence of Venice - its decay. This one is flawless. Not a crack, not a crumble. If you've ever ordered a Veneziana at Pizza Express (capers, olives, sultanas, 10p from each sale to the Venice in Peril Fund), then it's worth a quick trip here just to see what the city will look like if they ever sell enough pizzas to rebuild it. When I went to The Venetian for a gondola ride, they asked me: 'Indoor or outdoor canal?' That's my kind of canal. If you have never sailed past a perfect replica of St Mark's Square, inside a giant building, serenaded by a singing gondolier from Minnesota, then you haven't lived. The Paris hotel has similar charm. When looking at the original Eiffel Tower, of course we all think: 'That's all very well, but why can't I swim round it ?' In Las Vegas you can. The girders of a replica sit in the pool of the Paris hotel, and you can play double-deck blackjack on the streets of the Bois de Boulogne. The era of the mega-resort began in the 1980s, when everyone had money. This is when the Strip came into its own. Up sprang the Mirage (with dolphin pool and man-made volcano), Treasure Island (with full mechanical pirate show running around the clock), the Excalibur (a hilariously daft recreation of a medieval court), the Luxor (a giant pyramid containing a full-scale reproduction of King Tut's tomb) and more, all vast hotel-casino complexes with a mind-boggling range of recreational options. The downtown area, away from the Strip, hit back with the regeneration of Fremont Street, which now boasts a free lights show, pavement cafes and street entertainment. Las Vegas has become a location for respectable, even family, holidays. As she celebrates her 100th birthday, children will play around her feet - though she still allows herself the odd naughty wink at the camera. You could take your kids there. In theory, Las Vegas can provide the best-value holiday in the world: because the hotels make their real money from the casinos, accommodation prices are very low for the luxury provided. They all offer large rooms, ensuite bathrooms, big swim ming pools, several restaurants and bars, along with free lounge entertainment. If you can resist the urge to gamble and stay away from the tables, you will have a very cheap high-luxury holiday. But you and I will never understand each other ...

For Cesare Battisti - terrorist-turned-author, villain-turned-victim, a longstanding political, judicial and diplomatic headache finally facing near-certain extradition - has disappeared. His friends say, frankly, that he has left the country, shedding a police tail, and that it was the best thing he could have done. \"I can understand a guy who runs when he was living freely in France, and knows he faces the rest of life in jail in Italy,\" says the novelist Dan Franck. \"If ever there was a case of legitimate flight ... \" For Oreste Scalzone, one of the first of more than 300 reformed far-left guerrillas from Italy who have, like Battisti, sought refuge in France since 1985, \"his decision to unhitch his destiny from this extraordinary, senseless witch-hunt is nothing more than good human sense\". The popular French crime writer Fred Vargas, who published a passionate defence of her fellow author last month, The Truth about Cesare Battisti, says his apparent flight abroad is \"a legitimate act of self-defence. I was witness to the dramatic decline in his psychological state ... He proclaimed his innocence, and was portrayed as a monster.\" But not everyone is in agreement; Battisti's case (and his cause) have split France. To his backers - intellectuals, writers, politicians and showbiz stars of the broad left - he is a remade man who, like others of his kind, was promised sanctuary in France. That pledge has now been reneged on by a rightwing government that has brought shame on the Republic. To his opponents, however, Battisti is a criminal, a one-time member of a terror cell called Armed Proletarians for Communism, one of many violent ultra-left groups (including the infamous Red Brigades) whose bombings, kidnappings and killings rocked Italy in the 1970s and 80s and claimed 400 lives. Found guilty in Italy of three murders and of complicity in a fourth, Battisti must be punished they argue. The pledge of safety given to the men and women engaged in the Years of Lead, so called because of the sheer weight of bullets used in the terrorist attacks, was made by France's first Socialist president, the late Francois Mitterrand, in a 1985 speech to the League of Human Rights. At a time when Italian courts were dispensing unsafe decision after unsafe decision, often based solely on the evidence of informants who had been promised immunity from prosecution, he said the former terrorists would not be extradited from France on condition that they broke with \" la machine infernale \", that they renounced their past, and did not go into hiding, and kept out of politics. Some 100 former Italian extremists who took up Mitterrand's pledge, upheld by two French presidents and nine prime ministers of both the right and left, are thought still to be living in France. Most, like Battisti, who has a wife and two children aged 18 and nine, are now fathers and mothers. All are worried. And rightly or wrongly, all feel betrayed. \"Faced with a wall of cynicism erected by an irresponsible state, by a wall of silence built on the lies of certain former militants who even today are prepared to pawn the truth for their own safe conduct, France took the political responsibility to offer us a way out: lay down our arms, come out of hiding, present ourselves before the authorities of the Republic,\" wrote two of them, Enrico Porsia and Alfredo Ragusi, in Le Monde this week. \"That is what we did. For its part, the Republic guaranteed that no one wanted in Italy for 'politically inspired acts of violence' would be extradited ... Why does this pledge suddenly have no value? Twenty years later, we are criminalised and pursued by our new community. A country that had promised us asylum, given us residence permits and even, in some cases, French nationality. We cannot, we will not, submit to this 'betrayal of state'.\" The Paris appeals court that judged Battisti's case in late June, more than 10 years after another French court refused an earlier and near-identical Italian extradition request, did not sadly attach quite the same weight to Mitterrand's promise. In a country with an independent justice system, the courts \"cannot be bound by political promises made by a French government 20 years ago\", it said. The defence's argument was that Battisti should not be extradited because, although he was convicted in absentia in Italy in 1993, he would not - as he would be in France - be allowed a retrial; the court ruled, however, that the writer had forfeited his right to be retried because he had voluntarily refused to attend the first one. Several leading lawyers have since been heavily criticial of the appeal court's decision. \"Absolutely no new evidence was presented that was likely to change the opinion of French justice on the reality of the crimes of which Battisti is accused,\" says one authority, Jean-Pierre Mignard. \"The ruling overturned a policy of state that had been adhered to for 23 years, for no objective reason. It makes you think there has to be something beyond the confines of the case itself.\" Battisti was born in 1954 in Latina, south of Rome. Jailed in 1976 for a string of minor offences, he converted to the cause of the armed class struggle and joined the Armed Proletarians for Communism. Arrested in 1979 as part of an inquiry into the murder of a Milan jeweller, he was sentenced in May 1981 to 12 years in prison for possession of arms and membership of an armed gang. In October that year, he escaped. Battisti came first, briefly, to France, then headed to Mexico where he worked by turns as a graphic artist, a pizza cook, a barman and a freelance journalist. He arrived in France for good, preceded by his wife and daughter, on September 5 1990, and has since established himself as a crime and thriller writer. He is the author of a dozen successful and critically acclaimed works including Shadow Clothes, Never Again Without a Rifle, and Last Bullets. Most draw extensively on his past life; Paris-Match recently praised them as \"the best-written condemnation there is of the absolute impasse that is terrorism\". But in March 1993, a Milan court convicted Battisti in his absence of murdering a prison guard in Udine in 1978, a policeman in Milan in April 1979, and a neo-fascist militant in Mestre in February 1979. The same court also found him guilty of complicity in the February 1979 murder of a jeweller whose son was left paralysed by the attack. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. In a rare interview earlier this month, the writer vehemently protested his innocence. His 1993 conviction was based on false testimony from turncoats, he said. \"I have never killed, and I can say this looking straight into the eyes of the parents of the victims and the judges,\" he told Le Journal du Dimanche. Since the June court decision against him, according to Vargas, he was in \"a palpable state of distress. I don't know whether he had any confidence in the justice of this country, in Italy, in anything, and he had become very fragile. He cried a lot. He was scared. He had been psychologically destroyed.\" Battisti's supporters openly accuse the French government not only of abandoning Mitterrand's promise but also of conniving with the rightwing government of Silvio Berlusconi in a cynical grab for the law-and-order vote. \"The government put him in a completely impossible position,\" said Julien Dray, the Socialist party spokesman. \"We are rewriting the script, playing with people's lives and those of their families, when the page had been turned. And it is absolutely unberabale to hear Berlusconi giving lessons to anyone about observing the law.\" For its part, the French justice ministry said bluntly this week that it \"saw no reason\" why convicted terrorists should not be punished, adding that \"certain comments by those who defend Mr Battisti and approve his flight are appalling and irresponsible\". If Battisti's case has brought to the surface deep-seated antagonisms between right and left in France, the same is no less true of Italy, where domestic terrorism is still a live issue: only last year the Italian security forces broke up the reborn Red Brigades, whose guerrillas are accused of murdering two senior government advisers and a policeman over the past five years. Many Italians argue that France did not suffer anything comparable to Italy's Years of Lead, in which right and leftwing terrorists battled with each other and the state. The most famous victim of those years was the former Christian Democrat prime minister Aldo Moro, kidnapped and murdered by the Red Brigades in 1978. The pro-Battisti campaign in France has infuriated a large number of his fellow countrymen, many of who feel justice in such cases does serve a purpose. On Monday, two women who played a leading role on opposite sides in the Years of Lead sat across a table from each other at a meeting in Rimini organised by the Roman Catholic group Comunione e Liberazione. Francesca Mambro, aged 45, a former member of the neo-fascist NAR who received six life sentences, smiled and chatted amiably with Nadia Mantovani, aged 53, and ex-Red Brigades guerrilla who served most of a 20-year sentence before her release in 1993. Their reconciliation, with each other and with much of the rest of Italian society, has been made possible in large part because they paid a penalty for their crimes. It remains a running sore, particularly for the right, that some far-left terrorists never have. Roberto Castelli, the justice minister in Berlusconi's government, reacted with outrage to the news that Battisti had escaped, lambasting a European left which, he claimed, \"defends murderers [and] defends fugitives\". Castelli has made it a priority task to get back those still on the run. Top of its list is Alessio Casimirri, the only alleged member of the group that killed Aldo Moro still at large, currently living in Nicaragua. Also earmarked as priority cases are two other former Red Brigadists, Enrico Villimburgo and Roberta Cappelli, both now living in France. They top a list of 12 wanted former guerrillas whom Paris has - until now - been reluctant to hand over for trial in Italy. At the root of that reluctance have been profound misgivings over the impartiality of Italy's judicial system. Far from being eased, these have if anything been strengthened by the case of Adriano Sofri, a former leader of the hard-left Lotta Continua (Continuous Struggle), who has been held in prison since 1997 for a crime many on the right, as well as the left, believe that he never committed. Sofri is serving a 22-year sentence for ordering the murder of a senior Milan police officer. He was convicted largely on the word of a witness who turned state's evidence and had his sentence reduced. Sofri, a noted commentator who contributes each week from prison to the liberal news magazine L'Espresso, endured an absurdly contorted succession of trials shot through with anomalies and contradictions. Battisti's supporters may well be right in arguing that he will never receive fair treatment in Italy: that meted out to Sofri was so outrageous that even Berlusconi has felt compelled to back moves for his release. Between a country that will no longer respect a promise, and another where justice is maybe not always all it could be, the writer has made his choice: in Scalzone's words, \"He is ... I hope, as far away as possible. And, this time, really beyond their reach.\" Where are they now? Europe's other fugitive political extremists Germany: Three figures are still on the run from the avowedly leftist group whose killings and abductions made the 1970s known as Germany's \"decade of terror\" - Red Army Faction. Ernst Volker Wilhelm Staub, Daniela Klette and Burkhard Garweg are wanted in connection with a linked kidnap, killings and hijack in autumn 1977, which led to the murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer, a former Nazi who headed the German employers federation. Northern Ireland: As well as more than 400 republicans and loyalist militants released early under the 1998 Good Friday peace accord, there are reported to be 30 to 60 IRA fugitives. Living mainly in the Irish republic and America, and likely to be covered by a partial amnesty, they include: Charles Caulfield, named in parliament as the man behind the 1987 Enniskillen bombing where 11 died; Rita O'Hare, charged in a 1971 shooting (later a Sinn Fein staff member in America); Dermot Finucane, organiser of the 1983 Maze prison break. Spain: Among prominent fugitives of the Basque Homeland and Liberty group, Eta - which has killed more than 800 people in three decades - is its leader from 1987-89, Jose Antonio Urrutikoetxea Bengotxea, also known as Josu Ternera. Part way through a term as member of the regional Basque parliament, he went into hiding in 2002 to avoid a bombing trial. Whereabouts unknown. Eta members on the run live mainly in France, and in Latin America. Mexico is soon to extradite six. Italy: Scores of extremists went to ground after the 1970s heyday of groups such as the Red Brigades. Alessio Casimirri, a Brigadist wanted in connection with the 1978 murder of Aldo Moro, a former Italian prime minister, is at large in Nicaragua. Wanted Brigadists living in France include Roberta Cappelli, sentenced to life at home in Italy in 1992, whom France agreed to extradite, but has not; Enrico Willimburgo, sentenced to life by Italy in 1988; and Giorgio Pietrostefani, convicted in 1997 of killing the police officer from whose office window Pino Pinelli fell in 1969 - immortalised in Dario Fo's Accidental Death of an Anarchist. · Additional reporting by John Hooper","Id":"world/2004/aug/26/france.italy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"State of betrayal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/aug/26/france.italy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2004/aug/26/france.italy","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":2343,"webPublicationDate":"2004-08-26T22:59:49Z","id":"world/2004/aug/26/france.italy","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Veni (for 3 days), Vidi (the lot), Vici (child boredom)","body":"In a world of SATS and league tables, incurring the wrath of school authorities has never been easier: spilling Pernod on the Homework Agreement, falling noisily asleep on literacy action night and, most heinous of all, sneaking our kids away for a modest mid-term break. The tone of our school's regular diktats on this last issue place that crafty mid-weeker to Disneyland Paris on a moral par with badger-baiting. But because term-time travel is both more relaxed and hugely cheaper, my wife Birna and I began to wonder if it might just be possible to square the circle, or at least squash it into an oval, by condensing a family holiday into a weekend - particularly if that holiday incorporated a genuine edu-cultural experience, thereby placating the head when she found out we had bunked our three off to Rome on Friday morning. Yet our challenge remained a stiff one: to take in the Eternal City in the blink of an eye, distilling 2,500 years into two and a half days. The logistical prerequisite was flexible accommodation in a central location, a bill fitted admirably by the Palazzo al Velabro, a former monastery straddling the very spot where Romulus and Remus's uncle set a tempting precedent by dumping the kids on a foster wolf. Well up the style police's Most Wanted list, our three-roomed apartment featured Austin Powers headboard electrics and a heavily chromed kitchenette concealed behind dark wooden panels stretching from floor to distant ceiling. Wired on a potent travel cocktail of EasyJet and Italian taxis, the children were well away: Popeye in Italian, two lifts to hijack and that old standby, the overpowered bidet jet. My tolerance was borne of guilt. It can't have been easy to see the man you call daddy prepare in-flight refreshments by filling an old Coke bottle with water in the disabled loo at Stansted, or to watch in plaintive silence as he grimly relocates toothsome minibar snacks to the top of the highest wardrobe. Though Rome's excitable traffic is never going to be inaudible, from our balcony it was at least invisible. The walled and fountained monastery gardens sat in the foreground of a view which rolled back over pantiles, columns and ancient bridges to a fortified Roman hillside in the course of typically languid restoration. All that history was wondrous but, given our schedule, also rather daunting. Particularly as the next day I would reach the high water mark, mucus maximus, of an ailment which in a gentler age would have guaranteed a week off school. Breakfast blood-orange juice from a deli round the corner was a welcome tonic, but not nearly so bracingly effective as the arrival of Olivia, our tour guide for that morning and the next. Squatting down to child level she appointed roles fora trip to the adjacent Forum: Valdis, four, a vestal virgin; Lilja, seven, a fortune teller; their elder brother Kristjan, nine, a senator. Rival tourists were stumbling aimlessly about the dusty marble stumps, but Olivia painted the big picture via a series of vivid snapshots: the dice and marble game-boards etched in the law-court steps; the melted coins embedded in a floor when the Goths torched the place for the last time. There was no shortage of beguilingly horrid stories - following behind as Olivia led our three up the Via Sacra towards the Colosseum, we heard Lilja inquire: 'So how old was his little brother when he killed him?' Olivia knew her stuff - our historical guidebook was excellent and it transpired she'd written most of it - and she also knew mine: where to get the cheapest pizza and how to get your kids in free to the Colosseum by piggy-backing them through the turnstile. She even smiled indulgently when Kristjan passed a Corinthian capital on its side in a bramble patch, and told her that if no one was around and we'd brought our Volvo, his daddy would probably have had it in the boot by now. We felt a little lost when Olivia left us at lunchtime, as we did the following day after her 'animals and fountains' I-Spy walkabout... But there were always more sights to see and they were never far away. A favourite was the Mouth of Truth, an ancient cartwheel-sized stone bearing the image of a wild-bearded pagan, set into the portico of a church just behind our apartment. The legend is that those who place a hand in its open gob and lie will lose their fingers, but try as they might our lot couldn't get his jaws to budge - even when Lilja jammed her digits in and hissed: 'Jesus is my au pair.' Children are mad about Romans for the same reason they're mad about dinosaurs: savagery and scale. The Circus Maximus remains the largest stadium the world has ever seen, and its chariot races made Rollerball look like croquet. Tell your children the Area Sacra is home to a cat sanctuary and they'll smile; tell them it's also where Julius Caesar was stabbed 23 times and they'll cackle. 'Now I know what death sounds like,' whispered Lilja eagerly as we stood behind the Colosseum's royal box and pointed our thumbs haughtily at the ground. The late-spring weather was unimprovable - it was just hot enough to enjoy the shade. Vast water sculptures turned piazzas into the seaside and at the Trevi our lot premiered a memorable enactment of Three Kids In The Fountain . No one tutted or cared, but then no city has been tolerating tourists for longer than Rome, and practice has made very nearly perfect. We couldn't think of anywhere else that pressed so many familial buttons: SPQR manholes and peace banners for erudite, ethical Kristjan, enough beggars and snoggers to satisfy lurid sociologist Lilja, and a cloyingly coy Valdis in hair-twiddling heaven as waiters' pin-up biondina , little blondie. Birna shopped till I dropped, then dragged the children off towards the Vatican leaving me to blear about the piazzas in a dreamy Lemsip torpor. The essence of Italy, one available in concentrated form in Rome, is that when you're on holiday there you desperately want to be mistaken for a native, in a way that you don't anywhere else. Ich bin ein Berliner could only ever have come from the head; civis Romanus sum is straight from the heart. This phenomenon was keenly appreciated even by the children, who began striking insouciant poses, talking even more loudly than usual and transforming our bathroom into a temple of joyous communal ablution. Kristjan, comfortably the least aesthetically motivated of our children, kicked off a post-prandial round of I-Spy with 'CS', laboriously decoded as 'cool stuff'. And there were worrying moments when it seemed my viral complaint had been compounded by premature male menopause, the more wholesome symptom of which was an interest in Lamborghinis. Italy's urban diet is a juvenile fantasy of gelato and pizza; even the pig-cheek pasta described by a concerned waiter as 'a little particular' was slurped up eagerly enough to leave three young foreheads streaked with spaghetti whiplash. And the idiotic crap required to bribe children through a long day was at least cheap: your name in Chinese for €1, apparently desirable Burt Reynolds shades for €2. Anyone who recalls the head-melting tourist economics of twentieth-century Italy won't hear a word against the euro. Gone are the days of trattorias full of uneasy camera-clutchers wearing '13 trillion lire for a Coke - is that a lot?' faces. If children love Rome, then Rome loves children. With the world's lowest birth rate, bambino-besotted Italians are now having to lure foreign infants to get their cheek- squeezing fix. The Hotel de Russie, the sort of supremely refined establishment you'd expect to frogmarch junior guests into a sound-proof Portakabin in the underground car park, is actively targeting the family market. During a delightful (and in fact oddly reasonable) lunch in its citrus-terraced gardens, we learnt that its suites now come accessorised with child-sized hangers and even bath slippers. As parents, the only concern is whether the staff might at some point succumb to their most overbearing affections and do what they repeatedly threaten: actually eat your children. We'd never have crossed a street alive without biondina , the sight of whom always brought the traffic to an erratic standstill. 'The cars are all mad,' she quailed, as once again I held her aloft at the roadside and watched the raging sea part before us. Birna is currently engaged on a virtual march across some swathe of Hobbitland, which at the expense of making us all rather uneasy does mean that we now go everywhere with a pedometer. The Moores tramped 18.4 miles in those two and a half days, a statistic that would usually include provision for pursuing sundry junior legionnaires as they career waywardly off down a side street shrieking like napalm victims. In fact, I'd argue that they behaved admirably. Though you could pick holes in this argument, holes large enough to accom modate the Sunday morning incident in which they booted our front door until it was wedged half out of its frame, imprisoning us in the apartment suite for half an hour while a trio of chambermaids shoulder-charged it back into place. In any other country the staff would have got their own back by doing something unspeakable with our toothbrushes while we were out, but because this was Italy we returned that evening to find the kids' pyjamas not just retrieved from their far-flung resting places, but buttoned and folded on top of the pillows. We hauled ourselves up to the Villa Borghese on that final afternoon, and in its sun-dappled acres understood exactly why we didn't want to go back to the plebeian realm of Vauxhall Vectras and the McFlurry. Parks in London are generally of interest only to Canada geese and winos, but all human life was in vibrant evidence up at the Borghese. Hired tandems on the paths, heavy petting on the grass: a twenty-first century Renoir. Rome wasn't built in a day, but we had deconstructed it in not much more. Happy and knackered we made our way back to the apartment, making a detour for a final vista down the Via Sacra. Just before we got there two young priests drove past us in an Opel Corsa with the business end of a huge crucifix sticking out the sunroof. I'd been waiting all weekend, but at last a funny thing had happened on the way to the Forum.

She surveys the rows of keys behind the desk, all hanging from their hooks, the pigeonholes behind them spic-and-span and empty, before choosing one at random. A vacuum cleaner whines from the floor above. As I sign the register, she can no longer help herself. 'What are you doing here?' she asks, a frown knitting her brow. This is not out-of-season Ulan Bator or Antarctica or even Tierra del Fuego. This is Italy, a country people have been visiting for centuries. Tourism? Italy practically invented it. Travelling here, you get tangled in so many layers of time you lose all sense of perspective. You're not only seeing history, but tracing countless historic journeys as you do so. You can stand where Stendhal gazed at Giotto frescoes, painted on church walls constructed in the thirteenth century, on the foundations of a Franciscan chapel, which in turn was built on a Roman ruin. I didn't think it was possible to find a track that hadn't been beaten by thousands before you. The truth of the matter - which I'm too shy to tell her, mumbling about a holiday instead - is that I'm on the trail of the vanished. I'm searching for people I know I won't find here: the Edinburgh Italians. Anyone who's ever spent time in the coastal towns of Scotland will, whether they realise it or not, be familiar with the phenomenon of the Scottish-Italians. Go to any cafe in a Scottish seaside town and, more likely than not, the sign above the door will read 'Luca', 'Fulgoni' or 'Nardini'. The Italians changed the culinary and social face of Scotland for good. The idea of Scotland without Italians is as unimaginable as Iceland without geysers. Picture a Scottish holiday and remove fish and chips, coffee, cafes, pizza, ice-cream, and what are you left with? The prospect of huddling behind a windbreak with only some curling, sand-gritted sandwiches for sustenance. Although there were Italian immigrants in Scotland as early as the eighteenth century, it was only in the second half of the nineteenth that the real influx began. Fleeing the sharecropping system - land divided into increasingly small and increasingly useless plots from generation to generation - and often a feudal stranglehold on agriculture, men began the long walk to Calais, where they would catch a boat then tramp the length of Britain to Scotland's windswept coast. It's unimagin able these days to walk from southern Italy to Scotland. You'd have to be mad to attempt it. Or desperate. These men would locate the relatives or friends who had arrived before them and be put to work, selling ice-cream from a barrow or from one of the new parlours that were springing up. When they had enough money, they might send for their families. When I was writing a new novel about Scotland, I began to get the urge to make two of the main characters the granddaughters of one of these Italian immigrants. I was slightly anxious about this - I cannot lay claim to a single cell of Italian blood - but, being second-generation Irish, I have always been fascinated by displacement, by that sense of not-belonging. I started to loiter in Italian cafes, I read books about Italian immigration, I bought a teach-yourself-Italian tape. In the name of selfless and tireless research, I found myself forced to visit Valvona & Crolla, Edinburgh's delectable Italian deli and restaurant, several times. Then I met Tony. I was in the back of his cab, he was chatty and, clocking the Italian name on his ID card, I shamelessly turned the conversation. Tony told me all about his parents moving over here in the 1920s, how they collected the money, how they worked for a padrone until they could afford their own cafe, the place they opened, what food they served, the racism they encountered, how his father was imprisoned as a resident alien during the war. By this time I was leaning forward, notebook in lap. Where did they come from? And Tony described Abruzzi to me: 'Very high. Very poor. But very beautiful. Everyone in Edinburgh,' he waved his arm, encompassing the whole city, 'is from there.' Everyone? 'Most,' he concedes. 'It's campanilismo .' As I hadn't made much progress with my Italian tape, he had to explain: 'A man comes, then sends for his brothers, his cousins, his friends. And then those cousins and friends send for their cousins and friends. So,' he shrugged, 'all Italians in Edinburgh are from one place, all Italians in Glasgow from another.' He told me the names of the villages his family came from: Pietrabbondante, Vastogirardi, San Pietro Avellana, Castiglione. The names did it - those multisyllabic, mellifluous words. I was sold. I was going to write about Italy. And what's more I was going to go there. The two pages the guidebook devotes to the area are very disparaging: 'rather undistinguished... a low ranking on the tourist trail.' Molise is only three hours east of Rome but it might as well be on the other side of the world. It's very hard to get there, for starters. I turn up at Rome's bus station with a ticket for Campobasso - Molise's main town - but no one seems certain when the bus leaves, where it leaves from, if it will stop in Campobasso, or even if the region exists at all. I hang around for several hours, eat several pizzas, have several surreal arguments with the bus company, and eventually board a bus for L'Aquila, in the neighbouring region of Abruzzo. Until 1963, when they were separated like conjoined twins, Abruzzo and Molise formed Abruzzi - a term still used by many Italians. The area is viewed within Italy as an eccentric, slightly embarrassing, down-at-heel relative. When I told a doctor in Siena I was planning to visit he gave a snort and informed me that Abruzzi was 'a wild place full of mad people'. Historically, he explained, it was notorious for two things: earthquakes and 'bad magic'. It was home to witches, wizards and a mysterious tribe called the Marsi, known for their skill as snake-charmers. A strange festival involving snakes is still celebrated every year in a mountain village near Sulmona. When you go there, it's not hard to see why these legends and rumours circulate. Craggy mountains rear up from fast-flowing rivers and the narrow, twisting roads cut through thick, dense forests straight out of a Grimm's fairy tale. Disorientating mists swirl and collect in the valleys and the sun drops early behind the peaks. Bears and wolves are said to come out after dark. The region is bisected by the concrete roar of Autostrada 17, funnelling traffic from north to south. Stray several hundred feet from this and you find yourself deep in the 'wild place'. Driving on backroads from L'Aquila to the Alto Molise, where Tony's family lived, you pass through vertiginous gorges, climb hairpin bends, through tiny medieval villages, past expanses of lakes and along the edge of the Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo. The landscape is astounding - and empty. You won't see another tourist; you'll barely pass another vehicle, except for the odd farmer's put-putting Ape. When I approached the bowl-shaped valley in the Alto Molise I felt as excited as if I was returning to my own roots. I drove through San Pietro Avellana, through Cerreto, through Castiglione. The villages are tiny: houses angled into each other like overcrowded teeth, the air cool and thin, touched with woodsmoke. My hire car made people stare. One man actually backed up his van to have another look. I smiled at him, slightly nervously, and he gazed for a long moment, then nodded his head. The road climbed to the highest place, Vastogirardi. I parked the car on the fringe of the village where a couple of modern, low-rise houses were being built. Chickens fussed and scratched at the cobbled stairways that separated the greystone houses; chopped logs were neatly stacked by every doorway and scarlet geraniums grew from pots. The church was locked up, as was the single shop. The whole place had an air of desertion, of vacancy and I got the distinct feeling that everyone else knew something I didn't. The village was obviously inhabited but where was everyone? I wandered about the main square, looking out over the darkening valley, the terraces of vines, the dense trees. I had a drink from the water fountain, which was surrounded by several suspiciously new and shiny buckets. At the highest point of the village was a row of broken-down houses, the windows out, the doors off their hinges. The empty hearth on what would have been the room above floated in space, the floor littered with splintered rooftiles. I stood there, looking up at the gathering clouds through a ribcage of roofbeams, when I suddenly heard footsteps. I turned. An elderly man was passing the open door, very slowly, with the aid of a stick. He stopped when he saw me. He looked up at the sky, he looked back at me. Then he shrugged and said: 'Scozia. They've all gone to Scozia.' Factfile Maggie O'Farrell stayed at the Hotel Duomo (00 39 08 6241 0769) in the historical centre of L'Aquila.

In the bowels of Medici Chapel through a trap door in the floor there is a cellar, its walls covered with incredible Michelangelo doodles and sketches. This visual feast is permanently closed to the public. Meanwhile at the Certosa, or fortified monastery, just a stone's throw from the bustle of city life there is a hidden cupboard of precious Catholic relics (including the bones of St Francis of Assisi), so rare and holy that the Pope is trying to buy them for Rome (though the monks are refusing to do business). You can see the monks on Mondays. But they won't show you their relics - ever. So the Florentines are good at keeping secrets. I, on the other hand, am not. Which is why I'm going to reveal yet one more treasure that the Florentines are trying to keep under wraps. This place may not appeal to historians or art aficionados. But for dedicated followers of fashion, designer label junkies or anyone who just can't resist a fantastic bargain, it's as exciting as when Columbus pointed at land and said: \"Isn't that America over there?\" Welcome then, to The Mall, Italy's most exclusive outlet centre. And with Gucci, Ferragamo, Bottega Veneta, Sergio Rossi, Yves Saint Laurent and more at up to 60% off (and sometimes even cheaper, but more of that later) it is the Holy Grail of designer shopping. For years the Italians have relished the fact that everyone wants to dress like them. So it's not surprising that they want to keep it that way. Which is probably why when you arrive in Florence no one tells you about The Mall. Roadside signs advertise quick cook tortellini, the latest mobile phones and the wonders of Co-op. Of The Mall there is niente. Despite a huge expansion in February, it has yet to stake a claim in any guide book. The Prada and Mui Mui outlet (Localita' SS Levanella, Montevarchi) is mentioned in the Time Out Guide to Florence. But an hour outside the city centre (beware taxis can cost over £50 to get there), it's often so busy with coach loads of Japanese shoppers you have to take a ticket and wait . . . and wait. While The Mall may not be able to offer Prada, it is much bigger and closer to the city - around a 30-minute drive into the Tuscan hills - so it's much easier to do as a half-day excursion on a mini-break and not miss out on all the other spoils of the city. If you want to get there by public transport it's a train journey to S Ellero and then a short taxi ride. You have to take a taxi because this is not the kind of place you just stumble across. Only the shopping centre's back end is visible from the road. If you didn't know what you were looking for you'd think it was just another mini industrial estate. But once you're there it's like a piccolo Fifth Avenue - all leafy pagodas, cream paving slabs and sleek tinted glass. The prices at Gucci here may be low, but they'd never risk their reputation by selling their label bargain-basement style. All buys, however cheap, are wrapped with flair - acres of fluffy tissue and luxurious dark paper carry bags with string handles discreetly embossed with The Mall logo - sans address and phone number to add to its allure. Out of the handful of shops running parallel to each other Ungaro, Valentino, Armani, Bottega Veneta, Sergio Rossi, Yves Saint Laurent, Ermengildo Zegna and, of course, Gucci have the most wearable booty. Even if designer labels don't matter to you, it's easy to be seduced by the quality behind the brands. Buttery soft leather jackets, figure skimming tailored suits, and shoes and handbags - there's just so much you want to buy. And don't be fooled into thinking you only need an hour to do the lot. It may be last season's stock, samples and seconds, but browsing is a leisurely pleasure, because for once you can afford the stuff that is usually only seen splashed across celebrity bodies and glossy magazines. Georgio Armani suits (the posh arm of Armani), for men and women are €350, with another 30% taken off at the till. Gucci dresses - racks of sexy chiffon and silk that look as good gracing red carpets as they do your living room's Wilton for just €100. Last season's much coveted wooden handled YSL bag just €200 and perfectly tailored black shirts at €52. If you fancy a good rifle through some boxes at the back of Armani you can pick yourself up a Liz Hurley-esque swimming costume for the price of an M&S one. The queue to pay at Gucci snakes from the exit practically all the way back to the entrance. With shoes from as little as €30 and everything from logoed dog collars and leashes to fabulous silk ties and purses to baby booties and trademark snaffle-bit-adorned boots all at less than half price, it's no surprise. At the tills people are still grabbing at the shelves. \"How much are those keyrings?\" asks one American in the crowd. \"€10,\" says the perfectly groomed assistant. \"In that case I'll take five.\" Of course, there are the stick in the muds who will point out that spending any money is hardly saving money. But if you need some new clothes, Christmas presents or if you just like shopping, the savings you can make cover, at the very least the cost of your pizza and pasta during your stay, if not your flights, too (especially with flights to Pisa - a 30-minute train ride from Florence - being so cheap on Ryanair). If you were to spend £250 at The Mall, you can guarantee the same things at the same shops at home would come to at least £500, probably more. And the dinner party boasting bonuses are priceless. My favourite tale is of when I was accosted by a hawker on the Ponte Vecchio bridge one evening after dinner. Hanging from his arms were a selection of fantastically realistic fake Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Fendi handbags. \"Come on,\" he said, \"only €150.\" I showed him the real thing on my arm, which cost €130 from The Mall. That time, I smugly kept my source a secret. After all, I was looking as good as a real Italian. And when in Florence...

One man and more than 100 distilleries bursting with single-malt whiskies: it doesn't seem fair really. Clutching the wheel of his treasured Land Rover that he had plastered with anti-war and anti-Blair posters, Banks undertook an odyssey to every one of the nation's distilleries. Starting at Islay (an island of seven distilleries and only 3,000 inhabitants, an almost perfect population balance), Banks then headed for Speyside, heartland of the nation's whisky industry, and then on to the lowlands, Orkney and any other remote corner where the art of making uisge beatha - the water of life - is practised. The end result? Banks gained a stone in weight, acquired several hundred miniatures of different malt whiskies (no doubt drunk by now), and produced a deliciously diverting book that will bring a Pavlovian slobber of sybaritic anticipation to the lips of any self-respecting whisky drinker. Robin McKie Café Life Rome: A Guidebook to the Cafés and Bars of the Eternal City, by Joe Wolff £12.99, Arris There's Mario the philosopher, Vezio the communist, who serves a mean iced tea, and Raimondo Ricci, who carefully guards the secret recipe for his sweet, frothed-up espresso. This book picks out 22 of Rome's 8,000 cafes: mostly family-run places where the locals go, where you won't be ripped off and where quality is key. Wolff presents the cafes through the life stories of their owners, though he regularly wanders off in lengthy asides about the local history and characters and the famous guests who have passed through. One of my favourites, Caffe della Pace, in the back streets just off Piazza Navona, gets a mention here. This bar makes for a cosy, candle-filled den on a rain-drenched winter night or provides the perfect corner terrace for unabashed people-watching. Sometimes it feels as if Wolff gives a little too much information about the owners' children's birthdays and the like, but then again he also gives you - as an outsider in Rome - the sort of insight into the everyday life of Romans that you're unlikely to get without striking up a friendship. Maps could have replaced some of the more generic photos and turned this into a more practical guide, but the way the bars are listed area by area makes them easy to drop into the day's sightseeing. One thing that really comes across is that the owners of family-run bars work unbelievably hard for a modest return. But as Mario the philosopher at Bar Trilussa puts it: 'Pursuing money ruins life, love and friendship. Your fantasies become fantasies only of money. You lose your real dreams, and without dreams you are impoverished.' Kate Mikhail The Kindness of Strangers, edited by Don George £7.99, Lonely Planet This is a collection of short travel tales from a variety of literary luminaries including Dave Eggers, Simon Winchester and Douglas Cruikshank. It's a celebration of the unexpected acts of kindness which sometimes befall you when travelling, and is both heart-warming and at times soul-wrenching in equal measures. Amanda Walters's tale of 'Tea & Cheese in Turkey' is so moving it brought a tear to my eye, and Pico Iyer's meeting with a particularly dedicated trishaw driver in Rangoon and Carolyn Swindell's hilarious tale of shopping in Argentina might melt the heart of even the most jaded traveller. With a preface by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, The Kindness of Strangers should renew your belief in the inherent good in people. Nicole Mowbray A Place in the Sun - Dream Homes Within Your Reach, by Fanny Blake £16.99, Channel 4 Books (Macmillan) Covering 20 places in Europe, from Corfu to Champagne, this follows various couples and families in their search for the ultimate home in the sun. Each project starts with a budget, a goal and a desired place to live, followed by four suggested properties. It is not, however, always easy to choose. Mark and Ali, one of the buying couples, decided to give up on the suggestions in Italy and ended up returning to their 'life-long love affair with India' by buying a house in Goa. The book has information about the selected regions (apparently pizza was born in Campania), as well as guidance on types of property. With its focus on locations with cheap and easy airport access, as well as budget house buying, it is a good starting point for those with few ideas and less money. With almost three-quarters of the suggestions falling through, however, the question is whether these 'Dream Homes Within Your Reach' actually are within reach. Those who are intent on moving abroad are better advised to buy a more comprehensive guidebook. If, however, you just want the spin-off from the TV series, you'll be sufficiently pleased.

Quick piece to camera in the poolside jacuzzi, wander around the bazaar, stroll along the beach and finish up getting totally ripped to the sun-kissed tits in the ultrahip interspecial sexdisco. Bish bash bosh, a ton of dosh, a book deal, a dose of the old donkey pox and a suntan - sorted! But it's not quite like that. My first trip for BBC Radio 4's travel programme Excess Baggage was to the Country & Western theme park, Dollywood. Where I contracted near terminal food poisoning. We're talking total vom-fest. And rivers of ... well. And loads of ridiculously fat Americans going \"Oh my GAD! He's going to do it again! Get out of the way, honey! Don't look! Eeeeee-oooow! That's DISGUSTING!\" But this was an aberration. Surely. And my next trip, to the Stadio Olimpico to watch a Roma v Lazio \"superderby\" promises to be much more fun. I mean we're talking ITALY! The most civilised country in the world. OK, so they invented imperialism, fascism, organised crime and the professional foul. And they've elected a creep who makes Rupert Murdoch look like Mahatma Ghandi. But, hey, ITALY! Fine wines, fantastic food, the renaissance, the Colliseum, and Gianranco Zola. ITALY! OK, I'll level with you. Having read A Season With Verona - and been mightily entertained by eggheaded author Tim Parks' intellectually gymnastic explanation of yer average Italian football hooligan's tendency to make monkey noises every time a black player touches the ball - I was hardly unaware of the fact that Italian football attracts more than a few of the sort of rough, tough, jolly sort of fellow who'd bash your eyeballs out for thruppence. Or for looking at him funny. Or just for fun. But, y'know, ITALY! The beautiful game in the world's most beautiful stadium! In the company of the world's most beautiful people. ITALY! The taxi driver knows about as many English words as I do Italian. The difference being that he hasn't learnt all his words from Pizza Express menus and 1970s war comics. Anyway, the rivalry between Roma and Lazio fans is, says the taxi driver, pretty friendly. Jocular, even. Perhaps even (if I have interpreted the hand gestures correctly) a tad wry. Well, that's a relief. OK, so the walk from the hotel to the stadium is decorated by graffiti such as \"Lazio = Aids\" and (in what I assume is a particularly nasty reference to Heysel) \"Grazia Liverpool\". But, hey, boys will be boys. And anyway, like all great travel writers, I've got my antennae firmly tuned into the differences. The whirring swarms of motor scooters and the fact that the food franchises actually seem to be selling food. And the chaps selling it don't all look like they've recently emerged from a ten-stretch in Pentonville. And are doing this to kill time until the next bank job. Even the merchandising stalls look like they're run by Benetton. And they're festooned with rainbow banners proclaiming \"pace et amore\". Wow! So this is like the football equivalent of Woodstock is it? Groovy! And the stadium itself is ... amazing. I babble into the BBC microphone about spaceships and Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and rain forest trees - and then I hear some English accents. A bunch of Londoners, bubbling with enthusiasm, raving about the talent they're going to see and the amazing atmosphere they're soaking up. And then it all goes spectacularly tits-up. There's that sudden whoosh of time speeding up as hundreds of people simultaneously experience an adrenaline spike. Black clad lads, their faces covered in scarves, hurl smoke bombs and super-bangers at the queuing Roma fans and then run away again. Phalanxes of Italian riot police charge after them. And so, in the company of several hundred others, I run in the opposite direction. It's a bit mental. Which is when it happens. One minute I'm jogging along, tear-gas canisters and fireworks exploding all around, policemen charging up and down and I'm thinking: You know what? It's probably not such a good idea to be walking around the fringes of a minor riot at an Italian \"superderby\", gibbering away breathlessly into a huge BBC microphone. It's kind of like wearing a huge sign saying: Hello, everybody, I work for the evil mass media. Please come and hit me. And the next second - Bing-a-bang! Bing-a-boom! - I've been punched in the face. My glasses and the microphone have gone flying. Somebody is kicking me in the back while a young man with a scarf over his face is trying his very best to kick me in the groin. And two thoughts flash through my head in rapid succession. The first is; Should I biff this young rascal? The second is: Don't be daft! Without your glasses you can hardly see him, never mind hit him. So instead I stand there with my fists clenched, all puffed up like a red-faced bull toad, and scream \"Hey, hey, hey, hey! FUCK OFF!\" (And that's verbatim, I've got it all on mini-disc.) Amazingly (and illogically) I am too outraged and indignant to be scared. \"Listen, you vermin!\" I bellow \"I'm working for BBC Radio 4's Excess Baggage and when Sandi Toksvig hears about this she's going to be bloody angry! So think on!\" Actually, I don't. I leg it. I can't be definite that the young men who clobbered me were Lazio fans. But I'm pretty sure they were. Which is great, because now I know whom I'm going to support. Forza Roma! Meanwhile half of my brain is crying for my mummy and the other half is echoing the biker-battered Hunter S Thompson: \"Exterminate the brutes!\" Birching? Hanging? Flogging? Castration? Crucifixion? Lethal injection? Traumatic amputation? Bring it all on! Right here and right now I am a recently-burgled Daily Mail columnist on extra-caffinated cappuccino. And the 27-inch surround-sound TV screen in my over-adrenalised brain is playing a kung-fu revenge movie in which I, the righteous hero, devastate a horde of stunned Lazio ultras with a blitzkrieg of face-crunching roundhouse power-kicks. Like you do. Anyway, my seat is high up on one side of this enormous stadium. I've got a birds-eye view of not just the pitch but of both sets of hardcore fans who are packed in their thousands behind each goal. This is where Italian football has the British game beaten hands down. They are so organised! Both sets of fans have a whole series of what must be 300-feet long and six-feet tall banners in which insults aimed at the opposing set of fans are written in enormous and clearly readable block letters. Clearly readable, that is, when the tear gas and the smoke bombs aren't obscuring the view. I don't know what the signs are saying - but it's probably very hurtful and very, very rude. Then, just before kick off, the Roma fans pull off their piece de resistance. A thousand fans on the left suddenly start waving orange balloons. And a thousand ultras on the right wave red balloons. And then the centre block - which must consist of 20,000 people - unfurl this absolutely enormous square banner which shows a cartoon Roma player with his boot firmly placed on a head Lazio player's blood spattered head. It's then that I look down at the pitch and notice that the game has started. And, after a few minutes, Lazio score. The Lazio ultras go mental. They hurl themselves at the giant perspex screens that divide them from the section where I'm sitting - which is full of mum & dad & kids fans (of both teams). And a fair few football tourists. Lazio take control of the game and pretty much kill it off. And the Lazio ultras take control of the chanting. And they are brilliant at it. They have one which sounds like a Zulu war chant and genuinely chills the blood. Down on the pitch for Roma are such mouthwatering talents as Cafu, Emerson, Delvecchio and Totti. But Lazio have got Jaap Stam. And Jaap has had his three Shredded Wheat. No bugger is getting past him. Ninety minutes later and Roma are still one-nil down. Their fans in my section start to trickle out of the stadium. Soon I am surrounded by empty seats. And then, in injury time, Roma get a corner. And score. And thousands of Roma fans are on suddenly in their feet - screaming abuse at the stunned Lazio ultras. And so am I, That'll teach you to thump innocent BBC journalists, you swine. Swirling out of the stadium in the company of joyously singing and chanting Roma fans I soon manage to loose my bearings completely. But a nice traffic policeman - taking a few seconds out from trying to direct the enormous and chaotic herd of growling, grunting, whirring and beeping motor scooters - points me in the right direction. Which unfortunately takes me past another minor riot. More tear-gas, more sirens, more smoke bombs, more nervous riot policemen. I think about getting the microphone back out and recording the mayhem. Actually I don't. I don't even think about doing that for even a second. I skedaddle.

Like any road trip, it's fuelled mostly by running jokes: about bad weather and dodgy hotels, dismal toilets and skimpy breakfasts, the joys of trying to wash and dry underwear overnight. It's fun, all this, but you have to remind yourself from time to time that theirs is also a truly incredible journey. When I caught up with them on Tuesday, Jane and Luke were sitting outside a little roadside hotel in Alassio, a resort in the north-west corner of Italy. It was day 10 of their tandem ride from Rome to home (in Leeds) and they had clocked up more than 500 miles. They gave me an account of the story so far, dwelling a bit on the unseasonable conditions, the times they have leaned the bike at a 45 degree angle into the crosswind, how they have got wet most mornings and wetter most afternoons. How they've seen thunder and lightning, hail and snow. They tell me about the best of times: their first glimpse of the duomo in Florence, or the morning they got to the top of one climb just as the massed rainbow peloton of the Giro D'Italia, the big national bike race, swept through the valley below, a magical sight. They also recount how they have triumphed so far over the worst: on the longest day yet, nine and a half hours on the bike, they climbed 9,000 feet over the course of 70 miles from the sea to the snow line at the ski resort of San Stefano d'Aveto. The one struggle they don't mention, however, is the one that makes all the other obstacles seem like no obstacle at all. In fact, it's more than an hour after I've met them - when I'm asking Luke how well the tandem balances on the steep uphill gradients - that he mentions in passing how 'it's sometimes a bit tricky as Jane can't stand up in the saddle to pedal because of the secondary cancer sites in her legs.' Those closest to Jane Tomlinson have probably become familiar with this kind of observation, but its implications do not lose the power to amaze. Before I'd gone out to see her, I'd talked to her husband, Mike, who is back at home with their seven-year-old son and younger teenage daughter (the elder is away at university) and he'd told me about some of the milestones on Jane's long journey to Italy. It had all really begun, he said, nearly four years ago when Jane was diagnosed terminally ill with cancer in her bones and the doctors gave her around six months to live. Before that she had never really done any sport or gone far on a bike, but she was asked to do a sponsored 5km run in aid of cancer research. 'And being Jane she did not want to be seen as someone who would just walk the course. She wanted to do it as fast as she could.' Mike set out to train with his wife and the first time they ran she got to the end of their road and was gasping for air and doubled up. Three weeks later, though, she ran the 5,000 metres in well under half an hour. And her husband thought: 'How the hell did you manage that?' He's been thinking pretty much the same thing ever since. Despite and because of her illness Jane got it into her head that she would do the London marathon for charity next. 'To be honest that first time, we thought she would be dead by April, and we couldn't really see her running it,' Mike explained. He and their three children talked about the race to keep Mum going over Christmas. 'It became like a family joke in a way.' But Jane did run it, and once she had done one, she wanted to go faster. Though the cancer continued to spread she has completed two more marathons. And her ambition culminated last year when she completed an 'Iron Man' event that combined a 1.9km swim and a 90km bike ride with a half marathon - run in 1 hour 57 minutes - at the end. Jane had not that long been off chemotherapy, Mike says, 'so you are just thinking: \"How on earth..?\"' I'm thinking this, too, while I sit with Jane outside the hotel in Italy. Perhaps it is because it's spring, or perhaps it is the knowledge of what she is putting herself through, but Alassio seems all about life. There is the thick scent of orange blossom in the air, the old men are out on the pier swapping stories and twitching fishing lines, mothers and babies play in the soft sand at the shoreline. Jane is drinking it all in. I watch her do one of the live broadcasts to the news crew from Sky that is following her progress. She talks brightly of the miles behind her, and those still to come, of the challenge she is most looking forward to - the ascent of Mont Ventoux, the most feared climb in the Tour de France - all the time animated and modest and precise. She's lost weight so far on the ride, to the extent that there is nothing of her, really. She has brought with her in her pannier one pair of 'going out' trousers to change into, but she is forever having to hitch them up, tugging to tighten the waistband. She and Luke stash as many bread rolls and hard-boiled eggs from the breakfast table as they can carry for lunch. They dine out on pasta and pizza at night. But however much she eats, she can't seem to eat enough, she says. Jane came off chemotherapy for the last time in mid-January. It was her third course, and this time a very high-toxicity regime of drugs that systematically destroyed her immune system to try to knock out the cancer cells. It was not successful. For this journey she is taking nothing much more stringent than a cod liver oil capsule at breakfast, though she is also on a warfarin drip to keep her blood thin. The thought of just being here seems enough to keep her going, and it was that thought, she says, that got her through the worst of the chemo, too. 'From October to February when I was really very poorly I'd be thinking, this is where I'll be on such and such a day in May,' she explains to me. 'I've found it's easier to look forward to something outside of normal life, an adventure, than to fix on something that really matters to you. I could not have managed for example to look forward to getting my daughter through her GCSEs knowing all the time that I might not be there. But with this, it's like a dream. It's not real.' The urge to do this particular trip began when she saw a TV documentary years ago. 'It wasn't a brilliant programme,' she says, 'but it had a big effect on me. It showed this family who fostered children and who cycled through France with some of the children they had taken in, all with panniers on their bikes. It just looked wonderful.' After that film she and Mike decided to foster children themselves: 'We did respite care for two children with complex medical needs for about five years until I got very poorly again.' It was at that point that Jane remembered the other part of the programme, the cycling tour. 'My brother had a tandem, so he and I set off on a three-night trip in the Yorkshire Dales. This was two and a half years ago, and of course it rained all the time then, too,' she says. 'We enjoyed it, and I wondered if he fancied doing anything longer, to raise money for charity: and that's how John O'Groats to Land's End came about, which we did last year. And then we decided we wanted to do just one more.' Jane and Luke are the sixth and seventh children of a family of 10, five brothers and five sisters. They have always been close, and her illness has brought them closer. 'Luke's probably helped me more than anyone in the family - and they have all been great - just with some good solid advice. Giving me information about the illness and about treatments.' Luke is the senior charge nurse in the Accident and Emergency department at Jimmy's hospital in Leeds, so he's seen some things. He's as Yorkshire as you like, too, so he doesn't gush, but his sister's courage, as well as the half-million pounds she has so far raised for charity, is clearly a source of profound pride. Jane and Luke aren't cruising on the bike. They spin along at about 17 miles an hour, and they have had it up near 45mph on some of the descents. A couple of times they have attached themselves to the back of serious cycling clubs out on a 50k, and had a smile about how unhappy the young Italian racers have been in finding they could not shake off a tandem loaded up with kit and riding for a cancer charity. Feeling the tiredness in his own legs, in Alassio, Luke wonders how Jane keeps going. 'Sometimes,' he tells me later that night, 'I just haven't the faintest idea where she gets the strength from.' Jane herself puts it down to the fact that she is both very stubborn, and very lucky. 'I was first diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 26,' she says, when I ask. 'I'm 40 now, so I've lived with that fact for most of my adult life. I had a recurrence at 29. And then the other four years ago, when I was told it had spread to my bones and my lungs. There's a level of pain all the time, of course, and sometimes it can get very distressing, but I see it as part of my life. I mean, what am I going to do: sit in a chair and be sad? Tell people my leg hurts? There's still life to be lived. I'd rather get on with it.' On Wednesday, Jane and Luke were getting ready to cycle to Monte Carlo. By the end of the evening before, Jane had looked drained and pale, though she didn't say much about it, except that maybe she wouldn't mind eating soon, and perhaps she would get an early night. In the morning, though, she was bright and excited, leading the conversation at breakfast, anxious for any gossip she missed. She wanted to make sure she got her Sky bulletin done on time: it's important to her partly because her son Steven watches on the telly at home, seeing Mummy before he goes to school, and she worries if they are behind schedule, hoping it won't make him late. They were cycling to Monaco on the fast coast road. She imagined the motorists would be as much of a problem as the hills, but she has learned to give as good as she gets from drivers who squeeze them into the hard shoulder. Before she set off Jane showed me the two-armed gesticulation in the Italian manner that she has perfected from the back of the tandem, a performance, she remarked, that tends to frighten off even the most truculent of Ligurian lorry drivers. I took the train down the coast, and on the way read some of Lance Arm strong's book, It's Not About the Bike, his story of how he recovered from testicular cancer to win the first of his five Tours de France. Some of it, Jane found quite inspirational (while at the same time smiling and suggesting 'he can sound a bit of a selfish prick, too'). She does not allow herself much optimism, but 'if anything could make me believe in a miracle it would be Lance Armstrong, because when you read how poorly he was, he shouldn't be here.' Even so, she says, 'I don't hope for a cure, I just hope for a good quality of life, and I hope that when it becomes time for me to stop making the effort to still be around, I can let go.' There are bits of Armstrong's book that might just explain a little why there is something about climbing steep hills on a bike that might in itself be attractive to someone like Jane. Partly, according to Armstrong, it's about letting your body know who you are, what you might be capable of. But more than that it's about time. I underline one or two sentences where he explains this: just as moments never seem so intense as when you are flying down a mountain on two wheels, so going the other way, time seems to stand still: 'A minute suddenly seems like an hour when you are pedalling uphill.' When I stop underlining, I finish listening to the tape recording I had made with Mike, Jane's husband. He's talking about the night they found out that things could not get any worse. 'When Jane was diagnosed, by which I mean when she was told she was going to die, we were told quite late in the evening,' he says. 'A breast care nurse I knew very well, a lovely straight-speaking Yorkshire woman, asked me if I would like a cup of tea. I said no actually I'd rather be with Jane. And she said: \"Let me put it another way: you are coming into my office now for a cup of tea.\" So I went in and she sat at the other side of the desk. \"What you have to get into your head,\" she said, \"is that Jane is going to die. There is no cure. Don't be thinking that someone will save her. And once you have got your head around that, you will be able to move forward with your life.\" To be honest that is how it is. This is not like Lance Armstrong where the chemotherapy reversed his testicular cancer. For a woman like Jane with secondary metastatic bone cancer there is no cure.' Given this fact, Mike of course had some misgivings about Jane spending five weeks of the time she has left cycling through France. Some of this had to do with his usual fears about the strain she is putting on her body, particularly her spine, which, weakened by the cancer, could break. Mostly, though, it is the fact that she will be away from the family. 'We sat down a lot and talked about it, and part of her, of course, wants to spend every last minute she has with her seven-year-old boy and her teenage daughters. But weighed against that was the good she could do, the money she could raise, and the example she could set to other people in her position. No one is going to say how long Jane has to live now. The disease is a lot more advanced than it was four years ago. There are more sites and she is getting more pain from the sites. But in the end she felt she had set her heart on this and she wanted to do it.' I wondered if, knowing Jane and her disease as intimately as he does, he believed the endurance tests actually helped with the cancer. 'Jane will say no,' he said, 'because she does not want other cancer patients to believe they can save themselves by running a marathon or riding a bike. But in her case at least I would certainly say she is better when she is training. Last weekend she was in Rome and two journalists who saw her set off rang me up on the Sunday night and said that they were concerned that Jane was not well enough even to start to cycle. Every day since then, she has told me the bone pain has reduced. Whether that is because she is distracted from it by the ride, or whether it is to do with endorphins she is producing, I don't think anyone knows.' Mike and the rest of the family have not joined Jane on her trip, partly because they haven't the money, and partly because they do not want to disrupt the children too much. It must, I suggested, be a hard thing for him to sit with his son every morning watching Jane's progress on television. How much did Steven understand? 'Well,' Mike said, 'he knows that Mum's going to die. We joke that we'll have a two-seater, a Ferrari, after Jane's gone, though of course he knows we could never afford one. But he certainly knows that at some point soon there will only be us. He'll say: \"Daddy and I will do so-and-so after Mummy has gone.\" But whether he understands the implications of that, who knows?' Jane and Luke reach Monte Carlo in the early afternoon, and, for a change, just before the heavens open. They are quite light-headed from the ride, which has mostly been beside the sea. Jane says her gesticulations proved invaluable on the roads. In the thick traffic on the way into town they have also had, what she calls one or two 'Jane moments'. Recognising her from her TV bulletins a few ex-pats have ambushed her to give her a hug, or pressed a few euros into her hand for the charity. She is both amused and a bit embarrassed by the attention. When she has sorted herself and the bike out we sit down for a coffee. Outside, Monte Carlo is preparing for next week's Grand Prix, and the big yachts are manoeuvring themselves in the harbour. I mention to her the fact of Mike's misgivings about her trip, wonder if she still has doubts she is doing the right thing? Of course, she says, all the time. 'But more than anything else I felt that this would be the last year that we could raise funds in this way. It's intrusive and I don't have a lot of time left with my family. But I'm doing this because we could and because there was media interest, and I felt that with that we could maximise the amount of money we could raise. After this, though, no, I think I've well and truly done my bit.' She smiles. 'Also, although I'm away for five weeks, the thought of these weeks has got me through six months that I might not otherwise have got through. It's a pay-off, if you like.' I say that watching her over the last couple of days, it's been almost impossible to think of her as terminally ill, and I wonder if that idea ever properly sinks in to her either? 'Not really, because the whole thing is surreal,' she says. 'The fact of living and knowing that you are not going to live much longer, you never get used to that. It's an odd thing to live without thoughts of a future. I'm a radiographer in the children's unit at the Leeds General Infirmary, for example. I work hard, but I'm not going to get to a higher level than I am now, however hard I work, or however much I might deserve it, because time is against me. Or: Mike and I always planned to move to the Dales when the children left home. I'd quite like to do it now, but the upheaval would be a nonsense if I'm dead next year. The lack of ability to plan, to have dreams really, that's the hardest thing.' In a way, given that she is always so cheerful, so determined, it's a relief when Jane cries a bit, which she does now, as she looks out of the window at all the commotion outside, the gendarmes whistling at big articulated vehicles. 'It's just I have this feeling,' she says, 'this strong feeling all the while: I'm a Mum and my job's not done. I've never aspired to some highfalutin career, but I wanted more than anything to be there to see my family grow up. I've got a seven-year-old son, and I've got two nearly grown-up daughters, one of them has got a fiancé and I'm highly unlikely to see her married, I won't get to be there when Steven gets into high school, I won't be there with Mike.' She wipes her eyes, collects herself, apologises. 'It's just sometimes there's no point in doing the happy-clappy thing I do to cameras all the time, because my life's not like that. People have come to expect me to be this immensely positive person, but I'm just the same as everyone else, I sometimes get scared, I sometimes think things are shitty, I sometimes feel extremely poorly, and if I want to bawl my eyes out I will.' Though, she admits, finding a way to smile, she probably won't very often. But how, I wonder again, does she find the strength to hold herself together? 'Partly, she says, 'it's because I genuinely feel very lucky. When I was first told I was going to die my son was only three, and I could not bear the idea that he would not remember me. We all want to pass on a bit of ourselves into our children's lives, something that they can hold on to I suppose. So I feel I have been blessed in that now he'll know a bit about who I was. At 36, I felt very much that I was too young to die, that I hadn't done enough, now at 40 I feel I have done more than a lot of people do in a lifetime. So if it's my time this year, I would say thank you, God, for what you gave me. These precious four years. I mean,' she says, grinning, 'how many other Yorkshire lasses do you know that can say they have cycled to Monte Carlo this afternoon?' I agree I don't know any. 'And how many on Monday evening will be able to say they have got up Mont Ventoux on the back of a tandem? Won't that be the most wonderful feeling?' And after that, how far does she let herself look into the future? 'Well,' she says, 'after Mont Ventoux, I'm just hoping it's going to feel like freewheeling all the way home.' · Jane's chosen charities are: Sparks, a charity dedicated to medical research into conditions affecting babies and young children, Macmillan Cancer Relief and two local charities - the Paediatric Acute Services at Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust and Hannah House, a care home in Rothwell, Leeds.

You have to admire a hotel chain determined to mind its own business and not disturb guests who have inadvertently died in their rooms, as happened at one of their branches the other week, though three days without so much as someone popping in to see if the minibar needs another Toblerone is showing perhaps a little too much respect for a chap's privacy. And though the episode recalls the sort of unintrusive service for which our social workers are rightly famed ('Yes, old Mr Briggs did seem a bit quieter than usual when we visited...), I think fairness suggests that a lack of curiosity about someone slumped in the dark for so long without saying anything might be attributed to a surfeit of discretion rather than, say, poor chambermaiding skills. Actually, I got a taste of the Holiday Inns experience myself quite recently, when I took the kids off for a bargain mini break near the picturesque Leeds/Bradford airport (yeah, thanks, Dad) and made the mistake of letting one of them loose with the TV remote. Imagine my surprise when, instead of settling down to an evening with Michael Parkinson, the children were treated to the spectacle of a naked mustachioed man enjoying vigorous rear-entry sex with a woman young enough to be their mother. I immediately phoned the lobby, where the duty receptionist couldn't have been more helpful, waiving the porn charge when I explained that I had a roomful of boys and promising not to call the police. Unworthy jokes about death, chocolate and adult entertainment apart, though, I do prefer a faceless, corporate hotel to the sort of place likely to advertise itself as 'friendly' or 'family run' or a 'home from home' offering a 'personal touch'. I'm sorry, but I don't want friendship from a hotel, I want ruthless efficiency. I don't want homeliness, I want uniformed flunkeys, complimentary mint truffles, matching cutlery, professional bed-makers, chefs with qualifications, waiters who genuinely don't care what the traffic was like for us on the drive down from Hertfordshire. Give me experts! Yes, of course, one's sojourn at a family establishment may start promisingly enough with the proprietor and his missus and bright sixth-form daughter remembering all your names and making you smile at them 14 times a day as you bump into their various incarnations as sommeliers and skivvies and night porters, but wait till you start getting awkward and asking for a carton of milk or leaving a trail of seaweed through the dining room or having to complain that you can't get BBC2 or wonder why there's no hot water in the afternoons. Suddenly they're avoiding your eyes at breakfast in case you've found a mouse in the jam; suddenly you're one of those nightmare guests who's always asking for another ping pong ball. The trouble with the personal touch is that everything gets so... well, so personal. And before I get letters from the English Tourist Board, it's even worse abroad, or it was in the pensione I stayed in some years ago for my friend's wedding in Rome, when the groom's 12 brothers turned up without reservations (a capital offence in Italy), much to the displeasure of the owner whose glower followed us wherever we went, though needless to say he was nowhere to be seen when I was taken ill in the middle of the night and stumbled naked into someone else's bedroom before throwing up in the communal shower which, as I explained next morning, could have happened to anyone who had drunk three bottles of Chianti with his pizza. But did the man inquire as to my poor health even after I'd graciously offered to give the lady of the house a little something for her trouble? No, he was too busy baring his teeth and hissing the word Inglesi at me and spitting on the floor (which I think must be some kind of ritual), before escorting us from the premises. Can you imagine that happening at the Holiday Inn? No, they'd have dispatched an army of cleaners, apologised for the bad lighting in the hall and sent a basket of fruit to my room for any inconvenience caused. Unless I'd choked on my own vomit, of course. In which case, I might still be there today.","Id":"lifeandstyle/2003/jun/22/features.familyandrelationships","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webTitle":"Phil Hogan: Impersonal service","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/jun/22/features.familyandrelationships","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2003/jun/22/features.familyandrelationships","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":724,"webPublicationDate":"2003-06-22T10:58:47Z","id":"lifeandstyle/2003/jun/22/features.familyandrelationships","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"South Korea 2 - 1 Italy","body":"Full time We've just seen the best match of the World Cup (so far.) I've just seen a replay of the goal - Lee Young Pyo crosssed it in and Korean Superstar Ahn got above Maldini and headed it in. Italy's defence was brilliant until the last 10 minutes - but they paid the price for sitting back. With the players they've got why didn't they go forward? Amanda Webster from the Korean embassy says: \"My eardrums have just burst.\" Luca Crocco from Italy says: \"I've never, never seen a robbery like this. The penalty was completely invented by the referee, there was a foul on Totti and instead he was sent off (!!!) and we've had five perfectly valid goals disallowed. This is no longer football, this is the big robbery.\" However Steve Fish says: \"I'm expecting a peaceful drive to Milano! Enjoy the rest of the day ...I will!\" And so will the rest of us. Thanks for all your emails, they were much appreciated. ET + 27 Incredible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! South Korea 2 -1 Italy. With three minutes left of extra time, the ball falls to Korean Superstar Ahn and suddenly it's in the back of the net. South Korea are through! Italy are out! And Korean Superstar Ahn has just been given a hug by somebody that looks like Limahl! ET + 25 Choi booked for a tackle from behind on Vieri. The Italians have gone out of the last three World Cups on penalties. Could this be World Cup No4? ET + 23 Seol Ki Hyeon tries a ridiculous backheel on the edge of his own box. It hits Gattuso, who is suddenly clean through about 10 yards out. He shoots! It's saved! Brilliantly - Lee blocks it just over the bar. ET + 22Hwang should have scored! The ball came across and four (yes, four!) Koreans were queueing up to blast in the golden goal. But rather than chest it down and slot it in, Hwang gets a rush of blood and heads it straight at Buffon. ET + 20 Korea have gone to a sturm und drang 3-4-3 formation to try and break down Italy's defence. Vieri is on his own now, although Tomassi and Di Livio are trying to support him. ET + 18 Korea attack again, but Hwang can't find Cha - who had drifted into space on the edge of the area. ET + 17 Italy have a free-kick. Panucci's delivery is perfect and so is Lee's block on the six-yard box. All credit for the Italians for attacking with their 10 men. Jon aka Ormondroyd says: \"As Steve Fish is heading that way, can I recommend that he stops off in Verona for a pizza at the cheap and cheerful restaurant in the corner of the market place? They're excellent.\" ET + 16 We're off again. Half-time Barry Glendenning has emailed in. \"I know it's my day off, but I thought I should let you know that the Doctor Matthew Cobb who's been corresponding with you during this match isn't actually a GP (I think) and doesn't wish to be called by his full title. I called him Doctor Cobb in a minute-by-minute report last week and I think he was upset.\" Thanks Barry and sorry Mr Cobb. ET + 15 Trapattoni is not dancing on the touchline now, I'll tell you that for nothing. ET + 13 Totti sent off!!!!!!!!!! He goes down under Song's challenge trying for a penalty but referee Byron Moreno (Ecuador) pulls him up for simulation - that's diving to you and me. It's his second yellow and, despite the protestations, he's off! ET + 12 Great free-kick and a great save!!!! Lee anticipates the Italian wall jumping and drives it under. It's going right into the corner until Buffon palms it wide. Brilliant save. ET + 11 Totti in midfield gestures for movement but none is forthcoming. His long-ball to Vieri is intercepted and Korea break. Maldini - who's had a great game - hacks down Korean Superstar Ahn and Korea have a free-kick 20 yards out. ET+ 9 Italy break but Di Livio is expertly closed down. Again. Where are the Koreans getting their energy from? Ginseng perhaps? After this I'm going down my local health store to find out. Lee Chun Soo has just received a yellow card for clattering into Gattuso. ET+6 Korea are looking the more likely to score. They've just won their fourth corner of extra time. Italy clear but Korea come back again. Alessandra Ranica is back again to say: \"She feels like crying.\" ET+5 The Korean corners come to nothing and Italy attack. There are four players in the Korean box for the first time in about an hour but Lee makes an excellent under heavy - and that is the word - pressure from Vieri. ET+2 Totti has a run but he's well tackled, Korea break and win a corner. It's a disappointing one but Gattuso's slice gives them another one. The Italians are rocking. Can Korea take advantage? ET+1 We're off again. It's golden goal time. How will Italy play? Surely they've got to go forward. Full-time The messages of support for Korea are rushing in: Simon Wilson says: \"God, did that feel good. Shut the screeching Italian lasses in the pub up.\" M Allen says: there are quite a few long faces in Rome. Meanwhile Steve Fish has delayed his journey from Trieste to Milano to watch extra time. And who can blame him? Thanks Lucy Jolin for your comments on our minute-by-minutes. 90 min + 2 Another Korea chance! Seol nearly grabs a scintillating second but his shot slices wide. Everyone around me is going wild! 90 min Two minutes of stoppage time. Korea win a corner. Cha Di Ryu hits an overhead kick which is powerfully hit but straight at Buffon. 89 min Unbelievable - Vieri's has missed the easiest chance of the tournament. Di Livio whipped a brilliant low cross in and Vieri, six-yards out and with the goal gapping, blasts it over!!!! 88 min YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!! South Korea 1 - 1 Italy Seol Ki Hyeon. The ball hits Panucci's thigh, then bounces onto his arm and Seol slots it in!!!!!! 86 min More time-wasting from Totti, who wins a free-kick in the corner. It comes to nothing - not surprising as there's no one in the box. 85 min The Koreans are looking tired and the Italians are in full time-wasting mode. It's not looking good, I tell you. Seb Matthews wants to know if anyone has an mp3 of the fabled wo-wo/arirang song. 83 min Korea sub: Cha on for Hong. 82 min Sad to say, the Koreans are still coming forward but they don't look like scoring to get the draw (which I've backed). Paul Sharp asks much I've lost in bets on this World Cup now? Too much, Paul - but if Ronaldo is top scorer or Turkey reach the semi's I'll be well up. 81 min The first real moment of danger for Italy this half - the ball pinballs around in the box, but Korean Superstar Ahn just can't get a shot in. Immediately Italy go up the other end and Vieri's 25-yard is well-saved. 78 min Totti nearly scores the goal of the tournament, wriggling and weaving past three Koreans and finding himself on the edge of the box. But rather than let fly with a typical Totti howitzer he decides to take on a further man - and is tackled at the last. 76 min Korea are committing more men forward and Italy nearly capitalise again - Vieri wins a tackle only a desperate lunge from Lee Young Pyo stops him scoring. From the corner Italy have just two players in the area. You might have thought Dino Zoff's Italy were negative, but they've got nothing on Trap's lot. 74 min A fantastic 40-yarder from Gattuso splits the South Korean defence and suddenly Vieri - who, despite the goal has been quiet is clean through, one-on-one with Lee. But his finish is Heskeyesque (though without a tumble.) 71 min Italian sub: Di Livio off, Zambrotta on. Kenny McLeod says: \"Please inform Dr Cobb that no, I'm not Ken MacLeod the writer, although I often wish I was. I do know where he lives, though.\" 69 min Korean Superstar Ahn tries to take it past Cocu (who many of you reckon looks like a Smurf) but can't get through. Italy are so negative and defensive here - but they're offered nothing up front. 67 min Korea sub :Chun Soo Lee on for Kim Nam Il. 66 min It should have been 2 - 0 there - Zambrotta found himself in acres of space on the edge of the box, but with Totti hovering only found a Korean defender. Incidentally Kim has gone down clutching his ankle so there's going to be a break in play. 64 min Italy have a rare moment of pressure - but Panucci hits the wall for about the third time today. It's clear the Italians will be quite happy to hang on here. 63 min Korea sub: Hwang for Kim. Dr Matthew Cobb wants to know whether the Kenny MacLeod that asked about a creamer is Ken MacLeod, the science fiction writer? 61 min The Italians are encroaching - but the referee pushes them back. Sadly, Lee pushes someone in the wall and the chance is wasted. It was Zanetti that picked up the yellow card by the way. Italy sub: Gattuso for Del Piero. 60 min Korea win another free-kick, right on the edge of the box after a bad tackle from Damon Gough (Coco). Someone's been booked, but I'm not sure who. 58 min Zambrotta breaks down the right and finds Del Piero on the back post. From a difficult angle he hits a brilliant volley which is well blocked. Incidentally, Angela from Korea says that Korean Superstar Ahn definitely has a perm. \"It's a home perm courtesy of his wife, a former Miss Korea. The Korean newspapers refer to it as a 'bubble perm',\" she says. 56 min Yellow card for Tomassi for grabbing Lee round the waist. 55 min Korea win a free-kick in a dangerous area, about 23 yards out and central, but the Italian's charge out like madmen and block Park's drive. 53 min The Korean fans are banging drums and urging their team on with even more vigour. Speaking of chants, Angela from Korea says: \"There are three main cheers: what you call the 'Korea go forward' song is basically 'Korea must/will absolutely win' over and over again. The 'woo' song is a traditional korean folk song called 'arirang' sung at a faster tempo and with more feeling than usual (it's a pretty sad dreary song about a woman abandoned by her lover) And then there's the 'dae han min gook!' and 2-3 clapping sequence. There you go. Now you can be a Korean red devil, too!\" 51 min Kim's just elbowed Del Piero, who was tugging at his shirt, in the collar bone. Some referees might have produced red for that, but Byron Moreno (Ecuador) believes a talking-to is sufficient. 49 min Iuliano - who was struggling to get into the Juventus side earlier this season - makes another brilliant tackle to stop Korean Superstar Ahn. The Italians' tactics this half are clear: get ten men behind the ball then break. 47 min Korean are out of the traps like a favourite at the 2.14pm at Walthamstow, but Lee's shot is - to put it mildly - not his best. 46 min We're off again. A spotters' badge for Dan Morris, who says that Cocu now looks like Badly Drawn Boy. Half time Cheers for all your emails: Dolly Robinson, who is Korean, says that Ahn hasn't got a wavy perm but an Asian 'fro - \"It happens sometimes,\" she says. Seth Wheeler (plus about 100 others) point out that a light year is a measure of distance, not time and tells me to \"lay off the saki\". God, this is starting to sound like the corrections and clarifications column. So thank goodness that Jane Maher is riffing pointlessly on \"the justified ancients of wo wo?\" (you're not the same Jane Maher that works for the letting agency Doornobs are you? Because if you are, my sink still isn't fixed). 45 min There's two minutes of injury time to be played, which seems a bit low seeing we've had two time-zapping injuries this half. Coco comes back on wearing what can only be described as a tea cosy on his head, bobble et al. Kenny MacLeod asks what a creamer is - in my book it's a top attempt at goal. 44 min Coco is off getting treatment and Italy are down to ten men. Korea attack! Korean Superstar Ang lets fly from 25 yards but it's straight at Buffon. 42 min Korea win a free-kick, 25-yards out and right of centre. Korean Superstar Ang goes for goal but his shot deflects off Zanetti's knee for a corner. It comes across and Coco - who's blatantly holding Yoo's shirt - clears for a second corner but in the process of doing so catches Tomassi's elbow and the blood is soon flowing from his eye. It looks awful - something out of a Rocky movie. 40 min After Tomassi's chance, there's another lull in the Korean crowd, but they're soon off again. According to Steve Fish, they're singing: \"Arirang, Arirang, Arirang arario, Arirang kogayro neo-mau kan-da, Na-rul peo-ri-go ka-si-noon nim-un, Sim-ni-do mot-ka-so pal-pyong nan-da\" which translates to: \"As the stars, my tears are countless as they ceaselessly flow, You, so faithless are leaving me alone and pale, May your feet pain you at the end of the trail.\" And very beautiful it sounds too. 38 min Italy nearly make it two-nil. Tomassi - who looks more like a Strokes guitarist by the day - wins the ball in midfield and lays it to Totti, who does a drag-back and then slips a perfect pass back to him. Tomassi shots, Lee saves and the Koreans take a light-year to clear. 36 min For once Ahn, he of the wavy perm, eludes Iuliano. He spins on a sixpence and curls a creamer just wide of the post. It's the Koreans best effort since the penalty. 34 min Ahn nearly breaks through but Iuliano (who's not the mayor of New York, Ian Kay) makes a great tackle. He's having a great game in place of Cannavaro. 32 min Korea have lost their way in the last ten minutes or so. Most of the play is still in the Italian half, but the team doesn't look as zippy as they were in the group stages. Fortunately the crowd are still going at it at full pelt - can they inspire their team? 30 min Tomassi wins the ball in midfield and Del Piero picks it up. The crowd hushes expectantly but there's no need. The Boy Wonder shots about ten yards wide. Incidentally, Steve Fish has responded to Alessandra, who told him to drop dead. \"She obviously doesn't live near the Trieste-Venezia highway,\" he fumes. 28 min Possession stats: Korea 58% Italy 42%. So far, the Koreans haven't done much with it though. 25 min Zambrotta launches a rare Italian attack but he's tackled and the Koreans pile forward. Maldini has Korean Superstar Ahn's number though and makes a adroit tackle. The Korean crowd are chanting: 'wo -wo' again. James Norton wonders whether it means 'O Seoul Mio?' which I assume is some sort of weak pun. 23 min Korea continue to attack without actually threatening Buffon. Rich Miles says: \"I'm glad Iuliano's playing because I have a photo of him with a playing card stuck to his head in a Turin bar at 2am and no one knew who he was until now. Edwin van der Saar was there too, but he was a miserable git.\" 21 min The Koreans may be losing, but the crowd's volume is still high. Another yellow card for Totti for elbowing Kim. That's three yellows already. 18 min Goal Italy!!!! Italy 1 - 0 South KoreaTotti's corner is whipped into the near post and Vieri strong arms his way through the melee and powers his header home. Italy coach Giovanni Trappatoni does a jig which looks like the sort of dance your father does at a wedding. 17 min Kim receives a yellow card for a tackle from behind on Vieri, which looked harsh to me. Amanda Webster says: \"I'm not sure who I want to win. I work in the Korean Embassy in London and I don't know what will be worse...very depressed Koreans or very over-excited Koreans. Whatever happens, you can be sure there will be lots of high-pitched screaming.\" 15 min Totti's free-kick is a contender for worst free kick of the Korea Japan 2002 Mastercard World Cup. It travels about five yards before hitting Tomassi, who had just stepped away from the ball. 14 min South Korea are having the better of this, while Italy are in defensive mode, looking to counterattack. Del Piero wins a free-kick on the edge of a box with a swallow dive. 11 min Italy mount their first attack of the game. Tomassi slips it to Vieri in the outside left position, but his swirling shot clears the bar. It's a good game so far, much better than this morning's match. 9 min There's a break in the play while Kim gets attention for a head injury. Alessandro Ranica says: \"Drop dead Steve, it takes at least three hours from Trieste to Milano - and the honking and flag waving will have died down, especially with the heat by then. Besides, I would be quite surprised if people went flag waving on the highway.\" 7 min After a brief lull, the Korean crowd are singing their \"wo-wo chant\" again. If anyone knows what it means, please email in. 5 min Koream Superstar Ahn nervously steps up - he's a quiverin' and a shaking' and shoots. SAVED BY BUFFON! Ahn hit it low into the corner but Buffon parries it wide for a corner. What a start! 4 min Yellow card to Coco for scything down Park! Free-kick to South Corner - Seol Ki goes down after being hauled down by Panucci. Penalty to Korea! 3 min What an atmosphere! The stadium is redder than Angus Deayton's face after being confronted by a News of the World reporter. They're already singing the \"Korea Go Forward\" song - sorry, don't know the words in Korea - and that's what their side are doing. However Park's cross goes straight into Buffon's gloves. 1 min We're off! For what it's worth, I reckon the Koreans can take this into extra time, (and I have a few coppers on il as well). That's a 8-0 win to Italy then... National anthems: The jaunty Italian anthem kicks in, and very nice it is too. Meanwhile Steve Fish has written in from Trieste to say he's hoping for a Korea win. \"I have to drive across the country to Milano after the game and it will be a long journey battling through the honking and flag waving if they don't pull it off.\" Steve says: \"My Italian colleagues think they are in for a stuffing - however all I can see is a lot of shirt-pulling to slow the Koreans down and putting in a couple goals on the break.\" Well, it wouldn't be the first time, would it Steve? By the way, the eye is fine, though it was very sore yesterday morning. Preview: As expected, Giovanni Trapattoni has named Alessandro Del Piero in his starting line-up for today's match. However centre back Alessandro Nesta is ruled out with a foot injury. Mark Iuliano replaces Nesta, while Francesco Coco comes in for the suspended Fabio Cannavaro. South Korea coach Guus Hiddink starts with striker Ahn Jung-hwan, who scored the equaliser in the 1-1 draw with the United States, leaving Hwang Sun-hong on the bench. Shame.

On the south bank of the river, immediately to your left as you come across Putney Bridge, you will spy a church, half-hidden behind trees. Most of your fellow passengers - their faces set in the tired, closed mask of the London commuter - will not spare it a glance. Yet in this Church of St Mary the Virgin, on October 29 1647, one Thomas Rainsborough spoke words that have resounded through the modern history of the west. At the height of the English Civil War, England's revolutionary army was debating who should have the vote in elections to the Westminster parliament. Radical \"Levellers\" among the officers and regimental delegates were locked in fierce dispute with Oliver Cromwell. According to notes made at the time, Colonel Rainsborough said: \"For really I think that the poorest he that is in England hath a life to live, as the greatest he; and therefore truly, sir, I think it's clear, that every man that is to live under a government ought first by his own consent to put himself under that government; and I do think that the poorest man in England is not at all bound in a strict sense to that government that he hath not had a voice to put himself under.\" The poorest she still did not get a look in, but this was nevertheless a revolutionary statement of the claim for government by consent and equal political rights for all citizens. Here in Putney, in 1647, a plainspoken English gentleman described and demanded the essence of what we mean today when we say \"democracy\". His claim echoed around the old world - and into the new. Thomas Rainsborough's sister married John Winthrop, the Puritan governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony who declared that New England should be \"as a City upon a Hill\". His younger brother settled in Boston. There are six towns called Putney in the United States. Continuing up Putney High Street, this is what you will see: Hot Wok Express, Il Peperone pizzeria, Enoteca (an Italian restaurant), the Odeon cinema (probably showing an American movie), Sydney (an Australian bar-restaurant), La Mancha (a Spanish tapas bar and restaurant), Pizza Hut, Blockbuster video, La Noche (another Spanish tapas bar and restaurant), Superdrug, McDonald's and right next to it the coffee places Costa, Caffè Nero, Starbucks, then United Colors of Benetton, Pret à Manger, Burger King, Rogerio's café, the Piccolo bar - and that's only up to the railway station. In between are the old, sturdy British familiars: Thomas Cook's travel agency, Millets, British Home Stores, the Abbey National building society-turned-bank, Boots the chemist, Thornton's chocolate shop, the Halifax, W H Smith's. Halfway down the high street there is a pub called Ye Olde Spotted Horse, which features, amidst its faux-Elizabethan white-and-black half-timbering, a large and rather handsome 19th-century model of a black-and-white spotted dray horse. But the British horse, unlike the leopard, can change his spots. For inside this Victorian pub, blackboards above the bar now offer \"Wines of the Day: Merlot - Chile, Pinot Noir - NZ, Rioja - Spain, Shiraz Cabernet - Australia, Cotes du Rhône - France\". The menu promises \"Linguine with Ham and Goat's Cheese Sauce\" and \"Crème de Menthe Ice Cream Bombes\". A Young's Brewery poster on the wall promotes not beer but wine, with this incentive: \"Win a Trip to Spain!\" You may say this is just the superficial, brand-and-chain Americanisation and Europeanisation that we now encounter everywhere in the developed world; what has been called the Euro-American shopping mall. But the internationalism of Putney goes a little deeper. Quite a few of the apartments in the riverside block that looms behind the church are rented by city firms for their foreign staff, many of them American. The French community can be met in St Simon's Church in Hazlewell Road, and there was until recently a French bookshop in Lower Richmond Road. Nearby, there's the headquarters of Voluntary Service Overseas, which in 2002 sent some 1,600 British volunteers to work in 43 developing countries. In Upper Richmond Road you can call on Longview Solutions, a software company promising to provide you with \"a single source of financial truth\". Its other offices are in Toronto, Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas, San Jose, Atlanta and Madrid. Everywhere there are what a local estate agent snootily calls \"the Antipodeans\". Australians and New Zealanders - \"thousands of them\" cries the estate agent, with a mixture of personal disgust and professional delight - pack into rented accommodation and cram the Sydney bar. No worries. The district of Southfields, a maze of small streets, is now a little South Africa. The local MP quotes an estimate that as many as 20,000 South Africans live there. People from the rest of the Commonwealth - that noble republican moniker of the Cromwellian revolution, now incongruously applied to Her Britannic Majesty's former Empire - from Pakistan, India, Africa and the Caribbean, are not so numerous as in neighbouring parts of London. Putney can nevertheless already boast a Sikh temple, an African Families Association and, in Gressenhall Road, the world headquarters of the Ahmadis, a dissident Muslim sect originating in the Punjab and claiming millions of adherents in 70 countries. Finally, and resented by many local people, who believe they are taking scarce council housing, jobs and benefits, there are the asylum-seekers from every unhappy corner of the world. What you glimpse here, in Putney, are the many faces of Britain at the beginning of the 21st century. Janus, the Roman god of doorways, passages and bridges, had two faces, usually depicted on the front and back of his head, pointing in opposite directions. Janus Britain has four. The back and front faces can be labelled \"island\" and \"world'; the face on the left says \"Europe\" and that on the right \"America\". No wonder Britain's head aches. \"Island\" is a face that the whole world knows: \"this scepter'd isle/This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars\". Or, as a German newspaper once less flatteringly put it, \"the largest holiday island in the world\". \"Messieurs,\" the French historian Jules Michelet used to begin his lectures on British history, \"l'Angleterre est une île\". He thus perpetuated in four words two hardy continental myths: that Britain is the same as England and that it is just one island. In fact, the history of Europe's largest group of offshore islands has been shaped by the workings of four nations, the English, the Scottish, the Welsh and the Irish. But \"island\" will serve as fitting shorthand for a face that looks back with pride at a version of the British past which, like all national(ist) (hi)stories, blends fact and myth, memory and forgetting, true continuity and invented tradition. \"Island\" is the Britain, but more especially the England, of the parish church, the pub, the club, the college; of the retired colonel (no Rainsborough he) reading the Daily Telegraph and the gardener reading the Daily Mail; of country lanes, cricket, warm beer and shepherd's pie. Here is an England that sees itself still in the mirror of Orwell's often quoted and imitated essay \"The Lion and the Unicorn\", and reassures itself with that gruff celebration. In 1993, the Conservative prime minister, John Major, declared that \"50 years from now Britain will still be the country of long shadows on country grounds, warm beer, invincible green suburbs, dog lovers and pool fillers and - as George Orwell said - 'old maids cycling to Holy Communion through the morning mist'\". This Britain, understood largely as an extension of England, prides itself on an exceptional history of continuous freedom, self-government and the rule of law. The British, another historian remarks, \"have a genius for the appearance of continuity\". Yet, stripped of all sentimental mythology and invented tradition, the facts are still remarkable. There has been an England, and a people who have called themselves the English, continuously since at least 937, when King Alfred's grandsons defeated a Northumbrian coalition, including Danes and Scots, in the battle of Brunanburh. The county or shire - a term now made familiar to hundreds of millions of cinema-goers as the bucolic homeland of the hobbits - is one of the oldest continuous units of territorial self-government in the world. What people call \"the law of the land', that is, English common law, was there already when the Normans came, and still survives. From Magna Carta in 1215 to the English revolutions of the 17th century, the human and civil rights - including individual property rights - that would come to be seen as characteristic of \"western civ\" advanced furthest and fastest in England. The English parliament was the mother of parliaments. These things are true. They distinguish Britain, and especially England, from continental countries shaped by the legacy of Napoleonic administration, devastating wars on their own territory, and successive occupations. It is not a mere chimera that generations of continental Europeans, from Montesquieu to Jean Monnet, and generations of Americans have admired. The legacies of these things live on, in what British people say and do every day. \"World\" seems, at first glance, the opposite of \"island\". Certainly a Rastafarian evening in Neasden or an Eid-ul-Fitr among the converted cotton mills and new-built mosques of Bradford is a very long way from the rural England of weekend cricket, church and pub. But the historical connection between \"world\" and \"island\" is direct and simple. The world has now come to the island because the island first went to the world. England expanded, initially absorbing all the other parts of these offshore islands in an internal empire, then scattering across the high seas, to every corner of the earth, its own language, goods, customs and people - now including the Scots, Welsh and Irish as well as the English. In the process, Britain became already by the 19th century a \"world island\". While remaining an \"island world\" it was also an island engaged throughout the world, at once stubbornly insular and relentlessly international. I am writing this page in Oxford, less than a mile from where JRR Tolkien penned his romantic agrarian fantasy of the shire. Our local newsagent is Mr Mansha, who was born in Pakistan, our pharmacist is Mr Ahmed, who was born in Pakistan and worked for years in Saudi Arabia, our grocer is Mr Ayyub, who was born in India, married a Czech and has a flat in Prague, and our dentist, Mr Sapsford, is a cheery New Zealander. Were you to retrace Orwell's road to Wigan Pier, nearly 70 years on, you would find yourself staying often in Asian neighbour hoods. When the Indian state of Gujarat was hit by an earthquake in 2001, thousands of families among Britain's estimated 650,000 people of Gujarati descent were directly affected. At the same time, there were some 75,000 Iraqis living in London. A careful study has found that more than 300 languages are spoken in the capital. Only New York can seriously compete with London for the title of most cosmopolitan city in the world. These back and front faces of Janus Britain, \"island\" and \"world', make a strong contrast: between past and future, and, to some extent, between country and city. There's also an uncomfortable tension between the two. \"We Can't Keep Them Out\" shrieks a headline in the Daily Express, over a photograph of asylum-seekers running for a Britain-bound train in northern France. Many islanders do not want more world. Not in their \"neck of the woods\" anyway. The contrast between Britain's left and right faces, \"Europe\" and \"America\", is less extreme; both are, after all, faces of western modernity. Yet politically it's the conflict between these two that has been tearing Janus Britain apart. If George Orwell had gone to sleep in 1939 and woke up today, what would probably strike him most forcefully is the degree to which the old island has become both Europeanised and Americanised. The first shock would await him already on Putney High Street, with Starbucks to his right and Caffè Nero to his left. Our once famously awful British food has been transformed: pizza and panini are on sale at every corner, while you must hunt to find a suet pudding or a spotted dick. In Ye Olde Spotted Horse, and 60,000 pubs across the land, the British now drink twice as much continental lager as they do traditional British beers. The once distinctive British crowd is hard to distinguish in dress and physical appearance from the everyday shopping crowd on a high street in Germany or a mall in Wisconsin. People from Seattle to Sheffield to Sarajevo wear the same brands of T-shirt. jeans and trainers. As soon as the revived Orwell worked out how to turn on the television, he would find himself transported to America. A teenager of my aquaintance concludes that all the entertainment programmes he and his friends have watched regularly, as they grow up, are American imports. Friends , The West Wing, Frasier, Star Trek, The Simpsons, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Fresh Prince of Bel Air, ER: they permeate British popular culture. The head of one television channel explains that he and his fellow executives make an annual journey to Los Angeles to purchase these programmes. Their trip to LA is, he says, \"like the haj\". Together with the prevalence of American films and music, this has led to the Americanisation of British English. British teenagers use \"like\" as a verbal link in the same way as their American counterparts: \"he was, like, 'shall we go to Caffè Nero?' and I was, like, 'oh no . . .'\" (Their parents would have said \"um\" or \"er\", or nothing at all.) Another teenager tries to convince me that the American \"butt\", as in \"kick butt\", is an English word for bottom, bum or arse, which of course it was - in the 17th century. In 2002, John Major was asked on the radio about the first Gulf war. It was, said Mr Major, all too easy for \"Monday morning quarterbacks\" to be wise after the event. He obviously assumed that his invincibly British old maids, preparing to cycle to Holy Communion through the morning mist, would at once understand the meaning of a phrase from American football. The supposedly insular British took more than 56m trips abroad in the year 2000, when the total population was just under 60 million. Spain was the top holiday destination, receiving 28% of all British visits, then France, with 18%, then the United States, with 7%. Some four million British people go to the US each year. If you are clever in booking your flight with Ryanair or Easyjet, you can fly to Rome for £4.99. On the front page of the Daily Telegraph you find a horror story about the European Union right next to an advertisement for these cheap flights to European destinations. Inside there will probably be a feature about some middle-class English couple who are making a wonderful new life restoring a farmhouse in Provence. Britain's everyday intimacy with continental Europe is nourished by physical proximity; that with America - and with the other \"English-speaking peoples\", especially in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa - flourishes in spite of distance. In business, the media and academe, the transatlantic interchange is incessant. British and American professors rotate in and out of jobs in their respective universities. British magazines, such as Granta and Encounter, have been edited by Americans; American magazines, such as the New Yorker and Vanity Fair, by British journalists. The New York Review of Books sometimes seems to have more British contributors than the London Review of Books. Newsweek has identified a new city called NY-LON, inhabited by a privileged transatlantic elite who live and work in both New York and London. The 67 British dead in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center bore solemn witness to that intimacy. Then the altar in St Paul's Cathedral was draped with the Stars and Stripes, Her Majesty the Queen sang \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\", and, emerging, was seen to wipe away a tear. Three thousand miles are reduced to 30 yards in the phrase British people often use to locate America: \"across the pond\". At one semantic stroke, the Atlantic becomes narrower than the Channel. In 2003, the proposition \"that the Channel is wider than the Atlantic\" was put to a well-heeled, somewhat conservative London audience in a public debate. A majority voted in favour, although a large minority disagreed. On the European side, there is geography; on the American, language. With America, there is shared culture, history, economics and politics. With Europe there is shared culture, history, economics and politics. The British, writes Raymond Seitz, a former American ambassador in London, \"seem to know mainly what they used to be\". But even that history keeps changing. Until well into the 1970s, most English schoolchildren were told a charming story about what the bestselling popular historian G M Trevelyan memorably called \"a strange island anchored off the Continent\", and how that island became a great empire. This island-to-empire story was transmuted by Winston Churchill into a grand narrative of what he christened \"the English-speaking peoples\", with the United States as part of the same political community as the United Kingdom, together with its Commonwealth and Empire. By the end of the 20th century, you could fill a small library with books chronicling, dissecting and often celebrating the shared history of what was now called \"the Anglosphere\" - with, at its heart, Britain, America, and their common \"language of liberty\". Then, in the 1990s, a new wave of historians came with an alternative story: that of Britain's long, shared history with continental Europe. We were now reminded that Britain has only been physically separated from the continent for a mere 8,000 years, and is already joined to it again, by a \"tunnel under what is no longer called the English Channel, just the Channel or la Manche. For a millennium, the people of these islands were Catholic Christians, like most other Europeans; when we became Protestant, we were far from being the only Protestants in Europe. Many of our kings and queens were by origin French, Dutch or German. Britain was for centuries part of a single \"trans-channel polity\". In short, we British are not half so unique as we think we are. Politically, Britain shares great chunks of its formal sovereignty and effective power with the European Union. In many fields, EU legislation takes precedence over English or Scottish law. British citizens routinely appeal from the highest British courts to both the European Court of Justice and the separate European Court of Human Rights. This makes truly \"history\" - in the dismissive American usage of the word - Henry VIII's Act in Restraint of Appeals of 1533, with its seminal statement \"this realm of England is an empire\". Empire, that is, in the sense of sovereign authority from which there is no appeal. If you have to put a new level of fire insulation in your office door, or modify the way you package your apples or computer parts, this is probably as a result of a British regulation implementing some EU directive. Britain, one of the great trading nations of the modern world, no longer negotiates its own trade agreements. That is done by the responsible European Commissioner, most recently a Frenchman. Senior British officials spend much of their time in Brussels, trying to shape decisions that will directly affect British citizens and consumers. Britain is also formally committed by Article 5 of Nato's North Atlantic Treaty to go to the assistance of any one of 25 other countries, most of them in Europe, if they are attacked. For 60 years, this country has had troops stationed continuosly on the continent of Europe. In theory, the United Kingdom still retains its unlimited sovereign right to make war or peace. In practice, it could not have won the last war it fought on its own, the Falk lands War of 1982, without the overt and covert assistance of the United States. Scattered across East Anglia are bases with signs outside saying RAF Lakenheath, RAF Alconbury or RAF Mildenhall; these are, for all practical purposes, US Air Force bases, from which planes are despatched to foreign military engagements on orders from American commanders. An American military website for RAF Lakenheath describes it as \"England's largest US Air Force-operated fighter base\". Britain prides itself on possessing an independent nuclear deterrent, but its nuclear missiles cannot function properly without American support. In 2002, £1.5bn worth of Apache attack helicopters were reportedly sitting useless in sheds in Shropshire, because the US Congress had held up the transfer of software for a pilot-training simulator. As the British public discovered during the Iraq War, the British and American intelligence services are virtually married to each other, exchanging operational intelligence at all levels almost every day. A former head of the CIA has said he thinks the CIA is much closer to Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (M16) than it is to the FBI; and American naval intelligence, he went on mischievously, is probably closer to British naval intelligence than it is to American army intelligence. Does any of this matter to anyone except the British? If the Janus dilemma were unique to Britain, it would still matter a little to the rest of the world because Britain - with the world's seventh largest economy, a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, a big member state's influence on any EU decision and a tradition of worldwide military and diplomatic engagement - still matters a little in the world. But Britain's dilemma is not unique; or rather, unique only in its intensity, and in the banal sense that each national case is always unique. Every other European country has its own version, though usually less extreme, of island vs world, if one takes \"island\" to mean not the mere condition of being land surrounded by water (a physical fact of ever-diminishing importance) but the nurtured peculiarities of a real or claimed exceptionalism. France, with its \"cultural exception\", Germany, with its historical \"special path\" (the Sonderweg ), Spain, Italy, Poland - all have their own version of island. And all have a growing portion of world, whether Muslim Turks in Germany, Muslim Algerians in France or Muslim Moroccans in Spain. All will therefore be affected directly by any \"clash of civilisations\", such as some have seen looming between the west and the Islamic world since September 11 2001. All are torn between Europe and America. Most European countries have more Europe in their hearts than Britain; none has as much America. But they are all getting more of America, whether they like it or not, and they are all, in some measure, facing both ways. The writer Robert Musil said wonderfully of his native Austria after 1918 that it was \"an especially clear case of the modern world\". Today, Britain is an especially clear case of the modern world. · This is an edited extract from Free World: Why a Crisis of the West Reveals the Opportunity of Our Time by Timothy Garton Ash","Id":"books/2004/jun/05/highereducation.news","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Extract: Free World by Timothy Garton Ash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/05/highereducation.news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2004/jun/05/highereducation.news","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts","wordcount":3887,"webPublicationDate":"2004-06-05T11:07:00Z","id":"books/2004/jun/05/highereducation.news","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"An Italian says: 'It's edible but...'","body":"The Italian authorities have finally woken up to the fact that many Italian restaurants abroad, thriving on the promise of good Italian food, serve up a fare that not only is not particularly good, but is also hardly recognisable as food that an Italian would eat. Unlike the French, who are much more self-assured and colonised the rest of the world (gastronomically) by simply stating that their food was the best and imposing their taste on everybody else, we Italians have for a long time opted for adapting our food to local taste. This has given birth to unedible concoctions such as spaghetti on toast (in this country) or spaghetti with meatballs (in the US), and restaurants of dubious quality with a certain downmarket appeal to the uneducated taste of the locals. I would never eat something like that. It's too disgusting to even contemplate stomaching. But it's all changing for the younger generations. My daughters were brought up here in England and they like eating out at Pizza Express and Pizza Hut. I have eaten there with them. After all, it's food and it's edible - it's just not Italian. I'll order a deep-pan - but I just won't think of pizza when I'm eating it. After all, when you're in a foreign country you don't have a choice. When in Rome... Fortunately, things have started to change, even before the arrival of the inspectors from Rome. A new, more professional generation of Italian chefs has arrived and the public, these days more used to travelling to the continent, is less willing to accept anything other than the real thing. Indeed, the market itself may already be producing the change the Italian government wants to promote by certificate. Although low standards and spurious food are still widespread, London can now boast some Italian restaurants that could probably hold their own in Italy. Every Italian resident in London probably has his own list, even though he would find it hard to name more than a handful. My own favourite is Bice. My wife, who is Portuguese, but has been subjected over the years to a culinary brainwash, swears by Miraggio. But then, if you ask any Italian where you can eat the best Italian food in London, he would almost certainly reply that he very rarely eats at Italian restaurants. With few exceptions, the really good Italian restaurants are too expensive for someone used to Italian prices. Besides, any right-minded Italian will tell you that the best Italian food is that which is cooked in your own kitchen. · The author is a London-based journalist for the Italian financial daily Il Sole-24 Ore.","Id":"theguardian/2002/aug/22/features11.g21","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webTitle":"Food: An Italian says: 'It's edible but...'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2002/aug/22/features11.g21","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2002/aug/22/features11.g21","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts","wordcount":443,"webPublicationDate":"2002-08-22T01:52:39Z","id":"theguardian/2002/aug/22/features11.g21","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Track and field","body":"To understand a problem, they say, view it from a distance. Try 100 miles above the Earth's surface, says British-born astronaut Piers Sellars. Last year, while aboard the international space station, Sellars was struggling to locate his homeland as he peered down from a window. Bad weather was obscuring much of Europe and there was just one way to visually pinpoint Britain down below. \"The only way I could find it was by all the jet contrails leading into Heathrow and Gatwick that made a big cross over the middle of the British Isles,\" he explained upon returning to Earth. \"So that's how I knew somewhere down there was London.\" With air traffic, in large part due to the popularity of budget airlines, predicted to boom over the coming decade and governments around the world (not only ours) arguing for further airport expansion, we are already testing the limit of our skies. Coupled with the fact that airlines still enjoy, according to Friends of the Earth, almost £9bn worth of fuel tax exemptions and subsidies a year, it seems we are cruising on autopilot towards a future where flying is almost as commonplace asgetting the train or even the car for a journey over a couple of hundred miles. However, it's not only the view from space that will suffer due to this rise in air traffic. With the burning of air fuel cited by many environmental groups as the fastest growing source of climate-changing carbon emissions, we will all soon be ruing the seemingly win-win effects of cheap, convenient air travel. But what to do if, like me, you're someone who has always enjoyed grabbing a guidebook, catching a flight, renting a car and seeing what happens? Stop going on foreign holidays all together and spend two weeks on a deckchair in the garden? For some, perhaps, but I wanted to see whether it was possible to still enjoy a foreign touring holiday and, at the same time, make every reasonable effort to minimise my environmental impact on my destination and en route to it. Given all the heavy stuff about the impact of flying on the environment, my first rule had to be no planes. In an instant, vast swathes of the world were ruled out as a potential destination, leaving just Continental Europe. Not exactly a poor option, of course, but it still left the quandary of what type of holiday to go on and where. For advice, I contacted ATG, the Oxford-based tour operator that earlier this year won two major international awards for responsible tourism. Since 1979, ATG has specialised in the most environmentally friendly trip possible - the walking holiday. But what sets ATG apart is that 10% of its pre-tax profits are set aside for a trust that funds various local projects such as restoring ancient pathways as well as numerous local cultural artefacts. In addition, 65% of your money is guaranteed to be spent at source, therefore benefiting the local economy. Also, ATG doesn't advertise, instead using word of mouth to keep the cost of its holidays down. Given my brief, ATG suggested I go on an eight-day walking trip to Umbria in Italy. The holiday itself met my criteria - no rental car, minimal impact on the local environment, and enjoyment (ie, no digging of wells, or such like) - but the problem remained of how to get to Italy. Most ATG customers will fly to their destinations, but my only option appeared to be getting the train all the way from London. Going by rail still clearly causes pollution, but per passenger kilometre it is estimated that going by rail is about three times less polluting, if not more, than going by plane. And with an extensive and swift rail network serving most of Europe, the logistics of getting to Italy by train didn't seem to be a problem. The price was, however. Book a few months in advance and you can get a return flight with a budget airline to Italy for well under £100. Go by train, though and, depending on the class you travel, prices can rocket up towards £1,000. A clear conscience comes at a high price, it seems. Rail Europe, Europe's largest train travel agent, explained that to get to the town of Todi in Umbria, where the walking holiday began, I would need to first catch the Eurostar to Paris. I would then need to get across Paris from Gare du Nord to Gare de Paris Bercy to catch Artesia's sleeper train to Florence. Once at Florence's Stazione Santa Maria Novella, I would then be able to catch a fast train to Perugia, and travel the final leg to Todi on a picturesque, privately operated line. This would amount to three changes and 20 hours of track time each way - a considerable commitment considering a flight, check-in and transfers would have probably totalled less than 10 hours each way. As my days of spending overnight train journeys struggling to sleep on a couchette are now hopefully over, I was also keen to book a berth on the sleeper from Paris to Florence. Besides, my partner Jane and I were also planning on taking a particularly cumbersome piece of luggage with us - our four-month-old daughter Esme and all her accessories. We, therefore, treated ourselves to a first-class cabin for that leg, which meant the total return price for all three of us from London to Todi just topped £800. If we had chosen the cheapest tickets throughout, namely no bed for the night, the price could have been as low as about £440. Still, a lot more than by plane. But the train proved to be one of the most enjoyable parts of the holiday. Even though the cabin was more cramped than we expected, the freedom to walk around, have a shower, or gaze out the window, not counting being able to change nappies with ease, and arrive refreshed by proper sleep, was a welcome change to flying. The walking holiday itself proved to be pleasant surprise, too, considering that we had more than a few reservations - principally whether we would all actually enjoy getting up early each morning, lacing up our boots, and heading off into the 30C-plus heat for a five-hour-plus stroll. Taking a baby on a walking holiday under the Italian summer sun was, admittedly, probably as foolhardy as it sounds, but in hindsight we all coped much better than we had feared. Discounting the odd scornful look of an aghast local as we strolled along the strade bianche, Umbria's country tracks - mad dogs and Englishmen, and all that - Esme really seemed to enjoy spending each morning (the walking largely finishing by lunchtime each day to escape the sun's full force) in her sling taking in the sights as her crazy parents carried her through terrain that ranged from fields of broad beans, olives trees and corn, through to cooling oak woods and vast pastures of wild flowers and butterflies. Todi, the starting point, is a hilltown close enough to Rome for it to have become a weekend retreat for the capital's media and arts crowd. As with nearly all the towns we visited, it offers Renaissance churches, Roman ruins and a scattering of art that would divert your eye in any museum. The views down into the valley and across to the Monti Martini from the Piazza Garibaldi were striking - especially as what lay before us was day one of the walking, a distance of nearly 13 miles. We stayed at the four-star Hotel Fonte Cesia on the first night on a B&B basis - as we did in all the hotels on the trip. To keep in the spirit of our experiment, we made sure the use of air-con in the room was kept to an absolute minimum. We even considered not using it at all, but the heat was such at night that we were concerned about our daughter being able to sleep. We also tried to use as few towels as possible to cut down on the unnecessary amount of laundry that hotels get through. The first day's walking was potentially so hot and long that we decided that I should do it alone and all meet up at the end of the day at the next hotel, in the mountain village of Giano dell' Umbria. This meant that Jane and Esme would accompany our luggage in a car with Toby, our ATG route manager. Each day, the ever helpful and knowledgeable Toby would pick up our bags and drop them off at the next hotel, allowing us to walk without the added burden of struggling with huge rucksacks. This necessary car journey was the only time, apart from the odd taxi to stations, that a car formed part of our holiday plans. For my part, the walking on the first day was relatively tough, concluding with a fantastic trek up and over the 3,000ft grassy rises and ridges of the Monti Martini, then down to Giano. The next day was much shorter - just seven miles - so we all set off together to Montefalco, another hilltown labelled the \"balcony of Umbria\" due to its panoramic views across the Vale of Spoleto. Aside from its famous fresco cycle by Gozzoli, which shows how little the Umbrian landscape has changed in the past 600 years, the highlight was a visit to one of the town's celebrated vineyards. The sangrantino grape is grown on the slopes leading up to Montefalco and is used to produce that rarest of viticultural delights, a red passito, or dessert wine, that costs about €50 a bottle. We spent a couple of hours tasting samples at the organic Paolo Bea vineyard. The proprietor, Giampiero, told us how he grows vines without the need of chemicals, including an ingenious method to improve exhausted soil that involved planting globe artichokes under the vines. After a day in Montefalco, we descended the five miles down to Bevagna where we were able to see the work of ATG's trust fund. In the town's museum stands a once-neglected, but important, 13th-century wooden crucifix that has now been restored. Other delights in Bevagna included the 19th-century Teatro Torti and the Chiesa di San Silvestro, a romanesque church that has the humbling sight of the architect's signature carved into the stone by the door, dated 1195. A further day's walking took us to Spello, a Roman town that straddles a thin ridge at the base of Mount Subasio - the mountain where St Francis was said to have talked to the animals. We spent most of our afternoon there, enjoying the cool escape of the town's two principle churches, both of which contain excellent frescos by Pinturicchio. We also carbo-loaded on pasta and pizza in the evening at Il Cacciatore, our hotel's restaurant terrace, in preparation for the next and final day's mammoth 11-mile walk up and over Mount Subasio into Assisi - Umbria's proud ecclesiastical, architectural and cultural epicentre, a town now totally back on its feet after the 1997 earthquake. As it is a four-hour climb to the summit of Subasio, Toby drove Jane and Esme to the top by road while I puffed my way up through 4,300ft of olive groves, pine forests and grassy pastures. We all then descended down into Assisi together - still a five-hour walk. All day, the views extended at least 20 miles all around, but it was especially pleasing to look back over to Monti Martini and retrace our steps, now ant-like, from thousands of feet above - a level of satisfaction we would never have got if we had driven, or flown. Any astronaut looking down would surely understand that sentiment. · Follow Leo Hickman's quest for a more ethical lifestyle at money.theguardian.com/ethicalliving.

Giovanni Alemanno, the agriculture minister, is chief among them. This week he announced a plan to introduce a policy of quality control on Italian food served abroad, lamenting the effect that the ubiquitous Italian restaurant is having on the reputation of his country's food. \"Hundreds of Italian restaurants are created around the world every day,\" he said, \"but in most cases the only thing Italian about them is the name or a tricolour flag on display outside.\" The fact is that most of the Italian food served abroad has always been appalling. Think Spaghetti House, think Pizza Hut, think of thousands of Da Ginos, Da Marios, Amalfis, Bella Venezias, Borgo this and Trattoria that. You wonder why it's taken Italian politicians so long to wake up to the irreparable damage that these fifth columns of fifth-rate food have done to the reputation of one of the world's most exported cooking cultures. Of course, the most willing conspirators in this traducing of Italy's great cooking traditions have been Italians themselves - the immigrants who sought to make a living out of restaurants in the countries where they settled, and quickly realised that they didn't have to try very hard to do so. The real irony is that the qualities of Italian food and cooking have never been more highly appreciated abroad. We glug down oceans of olive oil at a cost per litre that no Italian would begin to consider paying. Balsamic vinegar that you would never find in Modena, its city of origin, sloshes through the professional and amateur kitchen here. Would-be Valentinas and Giorgios make pasta at home, for heaven's sake, something that few Italians can be bothered to do. Health-food shops and fashionable restaurants are saving such rarities as la cicerchia, a primitive pulse akin to a chickpea, when no one in Italy will give it table room. We worship pasta, mozzarella, focaccia and tiramisu. There are even some restaurants serving a passable approximation to authentic Italian food, albeit at a price. There are limits. We probably can't tell the difference between pancetta and prosciutto, between sugo (tomato sauce) and ragu (meat sauce), between mozzarella di bufala (made with buffalo's milk) and mozzarella fior di latte (made with cow's milk). The supermarkets, on which we depend for much of our supplies and information, still persist in making fresh penne, when it should only be dry; in using durum wheat for certain pastas when in many cases it is totally unsuitable; in adding cream to spaghetti carbonara, which has the same effect on pasta as making a pizza a deep-pie; and so on and so on. There is, after all, a difference between blind lust and true love. Food, like language, is the repository of history. You can read the history of a region in Italy through its food, from the Moorish influences of the sorbetti and pastries such as canaroli in Calabria, to the use of paprika, cream and veal stews, relics of the Austro-Hungarian empire in the north. The trouble is that our knowledge and experience of Italian food is strictly limited. Italy is a country with an unparalleled variety of dishes, ingredients, styles and techniques. Every region, every zone within a region, has its own very particular identity, based on produce and season, that goes unacknowledged on the predictable pizza/pasta menus of the British high street. The butchers in the market of Vibo Valentia make their zingirole, a kind of celestial brawn, only between October and April. Signora Cappello in Reggio di Calabria only stuffs cherry peppers with melanzane and pine kernels in July, when the peppers first come in. For reasons that remain obscure, the bridgehead between the British kitchen and la cucina Italiana has been the food of Tuscany, which is probably the most restricted and most boring in the country. But then Italians are similarly restricted. They suffer, or benefit from, a condition known as campanilismo, a profound sense of locality, of being rooted in a specific place. Because food has such a central part in Italian culture - Italians talk about food as incessantly and naturally as we talk about the weather - it is rare to find an Italian of one region who has a kind word to say about the food of another. Such passion also helps to preserve local food culture. That is why, on the whole, Italian cooking has changed far less in recent years than that of any other European country. Like Chinese cooks, Italian chefs are more intent on reproducing traditional dishes based on traditional ingredients than inventing new ones. Of course, it has developed over the centuries, absorbing new ingredients (there was a time when there were no tomatoes in Italy) and techniques, but it has resisted the wholesale globalisation and homogenisation of food cultures that has led to national food identities stamped beneath the mighty boot of global brands. Even so, perhaps Signor Alemanno should be directing his concerns at his own country, because there are disturbing signs that even Italy is edging towards the kinds of changes in the structure of its agriculture and retailing that have been the death knell of national food culture in less resistant countries. Open market forces, EU regulation and social change are all playing their part in bringing Italian agriculture and retailing into line with those of its neighbours. Particular vegetables, pulses, fish, cheeses and breeds of pig, sheep and cattle are all under threat. The Italian-based international organisation Slow Food has recognised the dangers and has set up what it calls an ark to protect endangered species and delicacies. The neighbourhood grocers, butchers, bakers and alimentari who once supported local life in Rome and other cities are disappearing fast. Agricultural units are steadily getting bigger. Agricultural variety is disappearing in favour of monocultures. It is one of the abiding ironies of Italy that the wonderful quality of the food, so sought after by buyers for the chrome-and-plate-glass food emporia in London, New York and Tokyo, is sustained by a resolutely peasant underclass. Much of the landscape, particularly in the south, guarantees to immure those who continue to live there in peasant poverty and perpetuate those values. The same profound rural conservatism is in part responsible for the fierce pride and astonishing high standard of local foods. In decrying the globalisation and homogenisation of food cultures, we fail to recognise the true cost of traditional indigenous cultures to the people who have to maintain them. This way we celebrate labour and indignity that we would not tolerate in our own lives. Whatever happens to Italian cooking outside the country is completely immaterial. We will do what we have always done - reinvent Italian food in our preferred image, just as we have with French, Chinese and Indian. The real future of Italian food lies not in the hands of such politicians as Signor Alemanno, but in those of Italian consumers, and, while there may be a bit of wavering in the ranks, on the whole they are standing remarkably firm. A couple of years ago I witnessed a dispute between a husband and wife over the correct ingredients for the filling of a pastiera, a kind of super-tart made at Easter. The argument involved, among other things, the correct mixture of crystalised fruits, the origins of ricotta, the use of crema (custard) and the addition of orange water. It started off in fairly good-humoured banter, quickly brought out jeering dismissal of the other's point of view, heated up into an intense exchange of views and finally erupted into all-out barrages that came to a head when the wife proclaimed with magisterial dismissal: \"Ma questo e un piatto romano!\" (\"But that is a Roman dish!\") I couldn't help thinking that it was all rather heartening. It was difficult to imagine such a passionate exchange in an English kitchen, or indeed an Englishman capable of holding his own on the matter of Victoria sponge.","Id":"lifeandstyle/2002/aug/22/foodanddrink","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webTitle":"Food: Nothing like mama used to make","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/aug/22/foodanddrink","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2002/aug/22/foodanddrink","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":1347,"webPublicationDate":"2002-08-22T10:40:04Z","id":"lifeandstyle/2002/aug/22/foodanddrink","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Race relations chief quits","body":"THE NEWS IN 90 SECONDS RACE RELATIONS CHIEF QUITS Gurbux Singh has resigned as chairman of the commission for racial equality after pleading guilty to a public order offence.

ITALY DISPATCH It appears that the Italian prime minister's recent judicial reforms have been introduced for the benefit of one citizen - the prime minister himself, writes Philip Willan. The prime minister of Italy enjoys the backing of a solid parliamentary majority, made up of docile and accommodating MPs, and is lucky enough to be the country's richest man and owner of its largest commercial broadcasting group. But the conflict of interests arising from Silvio Berlusconi's current combination of powers pales into insignificance beside the really alarming conflict of his interests: his struggle with the judiciary. Mr Berlusconi rose to prominence as a businessman at a time when it was customary to pay politicians in return for favours, to bribe finance police in return for lenient tax treatment and to buy the favour of judges whose verdicts had an impact on their business interests. The system was justified by a cold war democratic emergency and underpinned by a simple judicial principle: the impunity of the powerful. Like most other businessmen, he was taken aback when the system collapsed in the early 1990s and the rules suddenly changed. One could argue that changing the rules in the middle of the game wasn't really fair. But it was what the public was calling for when a mob pelted his political mentor, Bettino Craxi, with coins outside his Rome hotel and crowds gathered around the palace of justice in Milan to express their support for the \"clean hands\" anti-graft magistrates. * Read on here TODAY'S CROSSWORD CLUE Author lying in the street, exhausted (5) PAUL MACINNES ON SPORT England go into the second Test against India at Trent Bridge tomorrow on the upswing of their traditional cycle. The cycle has two phases: the first, which proclaims English cricket dead and its practitioners completely useless; and the second, which hails English cricket as the best in the world and Nasser Hussain's heroes capable of beating the Aussies with one hand tied behind their box. It is this mood of optimism that is sweeping through the press at the moment. Skipper Hussain would never be so naive as to admit to such confidence himself, preferring to keep his charges on their toes. However, Hussain's canniness is one of the solid reasons for believing that England really are becoming a force to be reckoned with, and so is the influx of younger players into the Test side, something likely to continue this week. In the first Test a fortnight ago, the ever-improving Andrew Flintoff, 23, opened the bowling alongside Matthew Hoggard, 25, supported by debutant Simon Jones, 23. The trio bowled India out twice, taking 13 wickets (for 271 runs) in the process. This time around Jones is injured, but his place in the bowling is likely to be taken by Steve Harmison, 23. Robert Key, 23, is also set to debut, and open the batting. There has not been such a cluster of youthful talent entering England's Test side for over a decade. What is more, with the new system of central contracts, an \"A\" team that is taken seriously, and the opening of Rodney Marsh's Australian training academy for England prospects, there has never been a better opportunity for these players to fulfill their potential. It is a sign of a strategy that is actually working, a right royal rarity in British sport. In fact, it is such a step in the right direction that they will probably go and lose the Test now. But make sure you follow it with us, won't you? Over by over reports on play from Trent Bridge, every day. AND FINALLY Hot weather in the US state of Wisconsin caused the yeast to rise in a consignment of pizza dough, reports the Duluth News Tribune. As the dough expanded, it pushed open the lorry's back door and dropped in chunks down a 25-mile stretch of road.

The train from Paris wasn't the Orient Express, but it was clean, swift and on time. The euros in my pocket, aesthetically challenged though they may be, will be accepted by any cab driver: the confusing ritual of money-changing at the train station has been eliminated. I have no nostalgia for the messy, melodramatic lira. In a wink of time, a gazillion zeroes have been abolished. Happiest fact of all: I am in Italy, a preternaturally pleasant place, a nation obsessed with the notion of beauty. Even its shape seems to have emerged from an atelier. Not just a boot: a woman's high-heeled boot kicking a Sicilian rock. \"Italy is not a serious country,\" an American foreign policy expert confided a few weeks ago. (I sometimes wonder how serious America is, given our witless and tendentious public life - and America is about as serious as countries get.) As I emerge from the station and look to my right, there is the darkened Pirelli building, gashed by a small plane several weeks ago; the horizontal scar, several storeys deep, looks very much like the wound caused by the first airliner to strike the World Trade Centre. It is stunning; it stops me dead. It was an accident, but it is also a reminder: any place can become very serious instantaneously these days. And then there's Silvio Berlusconi, who must be taken seriously now as well. A year after his election, he has survived as Italy's prime minister - he was gone in a matter of months after he was first elected in 1994 - and he remains quite popular, no small feat in a country that has had 57 governments in the past 50 years. What's more, we now know that Berlusconi's victory was not an isolated act of improvidence, but the beginning of a continent-wide trend; in fact, Berlusconi has come to seem downright responsible, given Europe's subsequent electoral follies. Last week, he thrust himself into the midst of global politics by dragooning the leaders of Nato, including Blair and Bush, to a lavish ceremony commemorating the new strategic partnership with Russia. The deal was already done, of course; the ceremony was Berlusconi's idea. He seems to have created a new role for himself in the world, a role he prepared for as a youth, when he worked as an entertainer on ocean liners: he is now party planner to the power elite. He is absolutely brilliant at this, as we shall see. Berlusconi represents a decidedly medieval form of postmodern politics: the rich guy with no experience in public life who buys himself a title. He is the benign despot of a virtual kingdom of his own design; the kingdom includes his political party, his television networks, his real estate, his fortune and his most important asset of all: his personality. He has pretty much ignored the conflict-of-interest questions inherent in such a duchy; he tests the limits as he goes along, skirts along the edge of propriety and greets each day with brio. About six months ago, he decided that he wanted to be foreign minister as well as prime minister, and so he is. Both prime minister and foreign minister have been and remain America's staunchest defenders on the continent. Most of his opponents are completely at a loss as to how to deal with this. \"He is the ultimate salesman,\" says Arturo Parisi, a director of Margharita, the most moderate leftwing party. \"He has no shame. Professional politicians have some sense of shame, of constraint. He has no constraints. He's an entertainer, a seducer. He uses his money. He gave expensive watches to all the backbenchers in his party. How do you compete with that?\" And so, this week's thought: if France's political situation seems an echo of America's recent, unlamented past, is it possible that politicians such as Berlusconi are the future? After all, we've already elected a billionaire mayor of New York, and hugely wealthy senator from New Jersey and a professional wrestler as governor of Minnesota. I have stopped in Milan because it is Berlusconi's city. He was born here, the son of a bank manager. He began his career as a real-estate developer here, bought his first television station, Milan 58, here - and made a fortune showing programs such as Dallas and Dynasty to a public numbed to enlightenment by the ponderous high-mindedness of the state television system. Several of his oldest, closest friends live here, including Fedele Confalonieri, who played the piano when Berlusconi sang on the cruise ships and is now the chairman of Mediaset, Berlusconi's television empire. Confalonieri greets me in his office, which is understated and elegant. None of the usual plaques and awards and pictures of smiling bigshots shaking hands. We sit at a round wooden table with a marquetry top. Coffee comes. \"Berlusconi was a very good singer, especially of French songs,\" says Confalonieri, without pomposity or affect. He is an entirely pleasant man. He tells the story of Berlusconi's business successes, and then he says, \"I am his oldest friend, but I am not a blind follower. We disagree sometimes. For example, I advised him not to go into politics. I told him he wouldn't win. He said that he would. A new product was needed in the political market. The political class was an esoteric priesthood. He said, 'Now we have bitter beer and sweet Coke, and there is a need for something in the middle.'\" There were other reasons for Berlusconi's public jump. Both the political and entrepreneurial classes of Italy were under intense investigation for taking and receiving bribes. Governments were falling; the establishment political party, the Christian Democrats, crumbled under the pressure. Berlusconi's fortune was in jeopardy. If he could win control of the government, he thought he might stem the prosecutorial tide. This turned out not to be true; the prosecutors came, convicted, were overturned and are trying to convict again. \"I am sure he did some things wrong,\" says one of Berlusconi's more prominent public defenders.\" But everyone - Agnelli, Pirelli, politicians of all political parties - played by the same rules. Everyone did something wrong.\" Berlusconi started his own political party in 1994. He used his corps of advertising salespeople as local organisers. He called the party Forza Italia, which was the chant Italian football fans used to cheer on the national team. He said Forza Italia would not be red (communist) or black (fascist), it would be blue. Blue was the colour of the national football team. He formed the party and won the election in three months. Mario Calabrighisi of La Stampa told me about a time he accompanied Berlusconi to Parma: \"Parma is a red city. It has a popular communist government. Berlusconi's advisers told him to have a closed meeting with Forza Italia supporters, but he wanted to go out into the streets. For the first 10 or 15 minutes in the main square, he had some real problems. People were shouting at him, saying, 'Berlusconi get out of here.' It was as if he didn't hear them. He had a compliment for everyone. Nice tie. What a beautiful ring. He went through the streets, visiting shops. 'What a wonderful store window!' And not only that, when he saw a store window that could stand improvement, he asked the shopkeeper if he could rearrange it a bit. He goes into the window and moves things around. 'I suspect you will have more business this way,' he said. 'In fact, I'll come back in three months. If business improves, you can buy me a cup of coffee. If it gets worse, I'll pay you the difference.' This is what you have to understand about Berlusconi. This is what he loves to do, especially on the world stage.\" At the G8 summit in Genoa last year, for example, Berlusconi wanted the entrance to the palace where the meeting was to be held lined with lemon trees. But there was a problem. The meeting was in June; lemons bloom in winter. Berlusconi's gardener delivered the bad news and was told by the prime minister, \"I think I have a solution.\" Lemons were sewn on to the trees. The question is whether Berlusconi pays the same amount of attention to actually running his country. He came to office on the promise of radical free-market reform and has been pretty much stymied. \"He is not Machiavelli's Prince,\" says Giuliano Ferrara, the editor of Il Foglio, an enormous, raggedy bear of a man who started life as a communist - he was educated in Moscow for several years - and emerged as one of Berlusconi's staunchest defenders on national television. \"He doesn't want to be feared. He wants to be loved. He has no barricades. He is ready to negotiate everything. From that point of view, he may be unbeatable. He will always find an agreement.\" Indeed, his close friend Confalonieri concludes our interview with a rather fetching analysis. \"He is the same as an American. He wants everybody to be happy now. For years in Italy, we've been plagued by two philosophies that put off happiness into the distant future. The church says it will come after you die. The communists say it will come hundreds of years from now when everyone is equal. It isn't difficult to compete against such ideas.\" I ask Confalonieri if it might be possible for me to meet with the prime minister. \"Of course!\" he says and calls - or appears to call - Rome, right there and then. Berlusconi is not in, but the meeting will be arranged, he promises. A likely story, I think. Rome - the opposition The Eternal City, the ultimate Adult Theme Park. I will not yammer on about the glories of Rome, present or past (the latter, dicey for an American) - or about the fact that, contrary to the popular British analogy, America is Greece, not Rome. (Britain, which styles itself Greece, used to be Rome and is now Gaul, though divided into four parts.) No, there is important business to transact: I am to meet with Sergio Cofferati, the leader of CGIL, Italy's largest and most powerful union, and the man who has emerged as Berlusconi's most effective opponent. There are several elements to the Cofferati story that are astonishing to an American. First is the nature of his union. There are 5.4 million members. Half of them are retirees, many of whom never were labour union members during their working lives. The elderly are organised in Italy. This is a terrifying thought. In America, we merely have a senior citizens lobby - the American Association of Retired Persons, informally known as the greedy geezers, and they get pretty much anything they want. In Italy, they get more. It is generally agreed that the pension system will soon bankrupt the country. The second astonishing element is the issue upon which Cofferati has challenged Berlusconi. There is a bit of the labour law - it is called Article 18 - that essentially prevents the firing of workers in companies with more than 15 employees. If, for example, Giovanni the welder has taken up the unfortunate habit of napping on the job, you probably have to go to court to get rid of him. Consequently, there is a fair amount of napping - or the moral equivalent of same - going on in Italy. Berlusconi proposed the teeniest of changes to the law: companies with 15 employees who wanted to add more would not have to abide by Article 18. Cofferati's reaction was a rather stagey outrage. He would not stand by as the rights of workers were trampled. He called a general strike. He called for a massive mobilisation of left-centre supporters. Millions participated. It was generally agreed that the symbolism of the campaign was far more important than the issue at stake: If Cofferati could stop Berlusconi on this most microscopic of clauses, he might stop Berlusconi on really important things. The outcome remains unclear. But, at the very least, someone has finally managed to beat Berlusconi at his own game: Cofferati had the simpler slogan. \"I will defend your job,\" he said. Berlusconi was left with the complicated, abstract notion that a less restrictive labour market would lead to a stronger economy. (Salesmen detest having to tout a complicated, abstract product.) Berlusconi - whose campaign slogans tended to be of the LOWER TAXES, HIGHER PENSIONS variety - had been caught on the wrong side of grammar, trapped in a compound sentence. In person, Cofferati is elegant and impossible. He sits in a lovely office, surrounded by modern art, overlooking the Borghese museum and gardens. He has the sort of perfectly arranged hair and precisely clipped beard that probably needs daily work by a flying squad of tonsorial specialists. He is wearing a dark suit, a pale green checked shirt with a button-down spread collar, a dark blue tie with matching braces. He speaks slowly, calmly. With even the slightest movement he emits a refreshing zephyr of talcum smell into the air. I find myself able to note all of these details because he says practically nothing of value. I ask about Berlusconi. \"I have nothing to say about Berlusconi,\" he says. I ask about the economic consequences of his position on labour flexibility. The problem isn't labour flexibility, he says, it is the failure of companies to spend more money on research and development. (Could this be because they're spending so much on napping labourers I wonder?) I ask about the rightwing political tide across Europe, and here he says something mildly interesting: \"The progressive forces in Europe are paying a high price for their support of a European Union that has emphasised the market aspects and not paid enough attention to social inequalities.\" (This is similar to what the leftwing intellectuals told me in France: is it possible that the left will now begin to place more emphasis on the EU as a heartless, free-market bureaucracy?) But that's about as good as it gets. He's about to leave his union position. Almost everyone believes he will enter politics, the candidate of the left wing of the centre-left coalition. He will not confirm this. After 26 years, he is returning to work at Pirelli. Unfortunately, his old job - inspecting the coating on wires - no longer exists. He will work in a corporate foundation, doing worthy things. (Translation: he's running for office.) As I exit the office, quite depressed, my semi-functioning mobile phone rings and there is surprising news: Berlusconi will see me. Rome - the boss If, as Michael Kinsley famously suggested, the gaffe is what happens when a politician accidentally tells the truth, what then is the formal interview? Quite the opposite, I suspect. It's certainly a difficult form for a journalist to master. Confrontation is almost always a disaster. Charm is useless (and how many charming journalists have you met?). With Berlusconi, I will try ju-jitsu. Perhaps if I go with his strength - party-giving - I will be able to look into his soul (as my president has claimed to be able to do with Vladimir Putin). We are to meet in his private residence, which is, of course, stupendous, on a street near the Piazza Venezia, where Mussolini used to rant from a balcony. Berlusconi seems to anticipate my strategy. He provides interpreter Christine and me with vanilla ice cream as we wait for him. I have heard that President Bush loved the ice cream prepared by Berlusconi's chef, Michele Persechini. My first question will take off from there. He doesn't keep us waiting long. He sweeps in, smiling, dressed less ostentatiously than Cofferati (grey suit, blue shirt, navy polka dot tie with tiny dots). I had anticipated some horrible perfume, but he isn't wearing any. His old friend Confalonieri, down from Milan, is there, and several other aides. We move from a waiting room, with ceilings that appear higher than the millennium wheel, to an office, with similar ceilings, and also tapestries, and a gigantic, undistinguished Renaissance painting by an unknown hand. We sit on cushy couches around a rough-cut marble table. \"I was speaking to Lady Thatcher a few years ago,\" he says immediately, taking control of things. \"She told me that she'd had 74 staff members at 10 Downing Street. Tony Blair had increased the number to 120. When I arrived here, I found 4,500 staff members. We've reduced that to 3,000.\" \"I understand that it's difficult to fire people in Italy,\" I say. He ignores me, produces a tri-coloured chart - \"primary colours,\" he jokes - with the status of all 170 pieces of legislation he has filed. He begins an extended dissertation on the difficulties of passing legislation, of doing any sort of reform. \"Machiavelli said that reform is the most dangerous thing a leader can attempt,\" he says - and, as he pauses, I manage to insert my incredibly puny question about Bush and the ice cream. \"Yes, he loved it. Everyone loved it. I was standing with Putin at the ceremonies. Three jet fighters came trailing red, white and green smoke. Putin asked, 'Is this a military exercise?' I replied, 'No, it's the menu.' Everything was tricolore. The starter, the pasta, the ice cream.\" He doesn't want to linger on the party arrangements, though. He wants to talk about the pact with Russia, and about Putin. \"I had a very sincere conversation with Putin at the G8 meetings in Genoa. I saw his great worries about what would happen if the Americans abandoned the ABM treaty and if Nato was expanded. Russia felt surrounded. He was afraid that some of his colleagues were looking east, towards China, for an alliance. He was very concerned. And I thought, should I take a part in resolving this, or not? I worked with all our partners and with the American administration. I went to Moscow and talked to Putin for two days. At the end, a telephone call with Bush was arranged, and the decision was reached.\" He goes on about the details of the plan, and of his hopes to arrange $10bn in aid to the Russians over the next 10 years. Eventually I am able to change the topic and ask him about the general shift towards the right in Europe. \"Yes, there have been lousy results on the part of the socialists. Tony Blair is doing well because he has essentially followed Thatcher's path. You have to distinguish between the moderate left and the left left. Communism was a good idea with bad results. And there is great trauma to reforming a communist regime. Gorbachev came to visit me at my home when he was president of the Soviet Union, and he asked many questions. I was so pleased that he had opened his mind to new possibilities. Finally, I was escorting him and Raisa in to dinner and he said, 'There's one thing I don't understand, which authority fixes the prices?'\" Berlusconi smiles, but does not laugh at his own story. He is not quite larger than life one-on-one. But he is in command and before he moves on, I sneak in a question about his own market-oriented reforms. I ask if Cofferati has beaten him on Article 18. He doesn't say no. He says: \"It's much easier to say 'I'm going to defend your job' than to say 'Your contract that says you can't be fired isn't a right, it's a privilege less than one-third of all workers in Italy have.'\" At this point, and for an extended period thereafter, he discusses his reforms, his budget, his successes, his plans. He is trying to convince me - contrary to the line from the left - that he is deeply involved in the details of governance and that he is succeeding with his plan. This is the sort of argument that is impossible for a visiting journalist from America to evaluate. But I assume that since he can't point to any grand victories - merely a series of bills passed and plans made - he hasn't had the success he would like. I try from time to time to ask more questions, but he is undeterred. He brings out the contract he made with the Italian people in the election, and ticks off, one by one, the promises he's kept. He brings out his budget. After an hour, an aide tells him he must move on. He talks for another half an hour. In the end, he tells this story: \"I was in Naples recently, 300,000 people came to hear me speak. I spoke for an hour and 20 minutes; they called out - Silvio! Silvio! - for four more encores. I was exhausted. I decided to stop in Naples for a pizza before I came home. We went to a restaurant and I heard a fabulous voice singing, a man with a guitar. I asked him to sing a very difficult song, 500 years old and he sang it. He said he knew thousands of songs. 'Do you ever write any yourself?' I asked. He said yes and sang three of them. The voice, and the music were beautiful. The lyrics were terrible. I told him, 'I'll write some lyrics for you.' So, for 10 consecutive Saturday nights he came here, to my home, after midnight and we wrote 10 songs. We've made a CD. We're going to sell it for charity.\" The classic American question about any colourful politician is: rogue or scoundrel? (scoundrels, stateside, being an altogether more sinister species) Clinton was a rogue. Nixon, a scoundrel. And Berlusconi? I suspect that he may have been a scoundrel when he built his business. It is possible, now that he doesn't need any more money, that he has slipped into mere roguery - manipulative, certainly; egomaniacal, of course; but he is also essentially correct about the need to reform the economy and, if Italy is lucky, too wealthy to be truly corrupt. Confalonieri follows me out and asks, \"So what do you think?\" \"If I were a Martian,\" I say, \"and I visited Cofferati and then this man and you asked me, which one is the labour leader and which is the president... \" He starts laughing and interrupts me, \"I know exactly what you're going to say.\"","Id":"world/2002/jun/06/eu.politics","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"The Prince","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jun/06/eu.politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2002/jun/06/eu.politics","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":3751,"webPublicationDate":"2002-06-06T11:25:26Z","id":"world/2002/jun/06/eu.politics","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"The showman","body":"Milan: I arrive in a mild state of Europhoria. The train from Paris wasn't the Orient Express, but it was clean, swift and on time. The euros in my pocket, aesthetically challenged though they may be, will be accepted by any cab driver: the confusing ritual of money-changing at the train station has been eliminated. I have no nostalgia for the messy, melodramatic lira. In a wink of time a gazillion zeroes have been abolished. Happiest fact of all: I am in Italy, a preternaturally pleasant place, a nation obsessed with the notion of beauty. Even its shape seems to have emerged from an atelier. Not just a boot: a woman's high-heeled boot kicking a Sicilian rock. \"Italy is not a serious country,\" an American foreign policy expert confided a few weeks ago. (I sometimes wonder how serious America is, given our witless and tendentious public life - and America is about as serious as countries get.) As I emerge from the station and look to my right, there is the darkened Pirelli building, gashed by a small plane a few weeks ago; the horizontal scar, several storeys deep, looks very much like the wound caused by the first airliner to strike the World Trade Centre. It is stunning; it stops me dead. It was an accident, but it is also a reminder: any place can become very serious instantaneously these days. And then there's Silvio Berlusconi, who must be taken seriously now as well. A year after his election, he has survived as Italy's prime minister - he was gone in a matter of months after he was first elected in 1994 - and he remains quite popular, no small feat in a country that has had 57 governments in the past 50 years. What's more, we now know that Berlusconi's victory was not an isolated act of improvidence, but the beginning of a continent-wide trend; in fact, Berlusconi has come to seem downright responsible, given Europe's subsequent electoral follies. Last month he thrust himself into the midst of global politics by dragooning the leaders of Nato, including Blair and Bush, to a lavish ceremony commemorating the new strategic partnership with Russia. The deal was already done, of course; the ceremony was Berlusconi's idea. He seems to have created a new role for himself in the world, a role he prepared for as a youth, when he worked as an entertainer on ocean liners: he is now party planner to the power elite. He is absolutely brilliant at this, as we shall see. Berlusconi represents a decidedly medieval form of postmodern politics: the rich guy with no experience in public life who buys himself a title. He is the benign despot of a virtual kingdom of his own design; the kingdom includes his political party, his television networks, his real estate, his fortune and his most important asset of all: his personality. He has pretty much ignored the conflict-of-interest questions inherent in such a duchy; he tests the limits as he goes along, skirts along the edge of propriety and greets each day with brio. About six months ago he decided that he wanted to be foreign minister as well as prime minister, and so he is. Both prime minister and foreign minister have been and remain America's staunchest defenders on the continent. Most of his opponents are completely at a loss as to how to deal with this. \"He is the ultimate salesman,\" says Arturo Parisi, a director of Margharita, the most moderate leftwing party. \"He has no shame. Professional politicians have some sense of shame, of constraint. He has no constraints. He's an entertainer, a seducer. He uses his money. He gave expensive watches to all the backbenchers in his party. How do you compete with that?\" And so, this week's thought: if France's political situation seems an echo of America's recent, unlamented past, is it possible that politicians such as Berlusconi are the future? After all, we've already elected a billionaire mayor of New York, and hugely wealthy senator from New Jersey and a professional wrestler as governor of Minnesota. I have stopped in Milan because it is Berlusconi's city. He was born here, the son of a bank manager. He began his career as a real-estate developer here, bought his first television station, Milan 58, here - and made a fortune showing programmes such as Dallas and Dynasty to a public numbed to enlightenment by the ponderous high-mindedness of the state television system. Several of his oldest, closest friends live here, including Fedele Confalonieri, who played the piano when Berlusconi sang on the cruise ships and is now the chairman of Mediaset, Berlusconi's television empire. Confalonieri greets me in his office, which is understated and elegant. None of the usual plaques and awards and pictures of smiling bigshots shaking hands. We sit at a round wooden table with a marquetry top. Coffee comes. \"Berlusconi was a very good singer, especially of French songs,\" says Confalonieri without pomposity. He is an entirely pleasant man. He tells the story of Berlusconi's business successes, and then he says, \"I am his oldest friend, but I am not a blind follower. We disagree sometimes. For example, I advised him not to go into politics. I told him he wouldn't win. He said that he would. A new product was needed in the political market. The political class was an esoteric priesthood. He said, 'Now we have bitter beer and sweet Coke, and there is a need for something in the middle.'\" There were other reasons for Berlusconi's public jump. Both the political and entrepreneurial classes of Italy were under intense investigation for taking and receiving bribes. Governments were falling; the establishment political party, the Christian Democrats, crumbled under the pressure. Berlusconi's fortune was in jeopardy. If he could win control of the government, he thought he might stem the prosecutorial tide. This turned out not to be true; the prosecutors came, convicted, were overturned and are trying to convict again. \"I am sure he did some things wrong,\" says one of Berlusconi's more prominent public defenders. \"But everyone - Agnelli, Pirelli, politicians of all political parties - played by the same rules. Everyone did something wrong.\" Berlusconi started his own political party in 1994. He used his corps of advertising salespeople as local organisers. He called the party Forza Italia, which was the chant Italian football fans used to cheer on the national team. He said Forza Italia would not be red (communist) or black (fascist); it would be blue. Blue was the colour of the national football team. He formed the party and won the election in three months. Mario Calabrighisi of La Stampa told me about a time he accompanied Berlusconi to Parma: \"Parma is a red city. It has a popular communist government. Berlusconi's advisers told him to have a closed meeting with Forza Italia supporters, but he wanted to go out into the streets. For the first 10 or 15 minutes in the main square, he had some real problems. People were shouting at him, saying, 'Berlusconi, get out of here.' \"It was as if he didn't hear them. He had a compliment for everyone. 'Nice tie.' 'What a beautiful ring.' He went through the streets, visiting shops. 'What a wonderful store window!' And not only that: when he saw a store window that could stand improvement, he asked the shopkeeper if he could rearrange it a bit. He goes into the window and moves things around. 'I suspect you will have more business this way,' he said. 'In fact, I'll come back in three months. If business improves, you can buy me a cup of coffee. If it gets worse, I'll pay you the difference.' This is what you have to understand about Berlusconi. This is what he loves to do, especially on the world stage.\" The question is whether Berlusconi pays the same amount of attention to actually running his country. He came to office on the promise of radical free-market reform and has been pretty much stymied. \"He is not Machiavelli's Prince,\" says Giuliano Ferrara, the editor of Il Foglio, an enormous, raggedy bear of a man who started life as a communist - he was educated in Moscow for several years - and emerged as one of Berlusconi's staunchest defenders on national television. \"He doesn't want to be feared. He wants to be loved. He has no barricades. He is ready to negotiate everything. From that point of view, he may be unbeatable. He will always find an agreement.\" Indeed, his close friend Confalonieri concludes our interview with a rather fetching analysis. \"He is the same as an American. He wants everybody to be happy now. For years in Italy we've been plagued by two philosophies that put off happiness into the distant future. The church says it will come after you die. The communists say it will come hundreds of years from now when everyone is equal. It isn't difficult to compete against such ideas.\" I ask Confalonieri if it might be possible for me to meet with the prime minister. \"Of course!\" he says and calls - or appears to call - Rome right there and then. Berlusconi is not in, but the meeting will be arranged, he promises. A likely story, I think. Rome - the opposition The Eternal City, the ultimate Adult Theme Park. I will not yammer on about the glories of Rome, present or past. No, there is important business to transact: I am to meet with Sergio Cofferati, the leader of CGIL, Italy's largest and most powerful union, and the man who has emerged as Berlusconi's most effective opponent. There are several elements to the Cofferati story that are astonishing to an American. First is the nature of his union. There are 5.4 million members. Half of them are retirees, many of whom never were labour union members during their working lives. The elderly are organised in Italy. This is a terrifying thought. In America we merely have a senior citizens lobby - the American Association of Retired Persons, informally known as the greedy geezers, and they get pretty much anything they want. In Italy they get more. It is generally agreed that the pension system will soon bankrupt the country. The second astonishing element is the issue upon which Cofferati has challenged Berlusconi. There is a bit of the labour law - it is called Article 18 - that essentially prevents the firing of workers in companies with more than 15 employees. If, for example, Giovanni the welder has taken up the unfortunate habit of napping on the job, you probably have to go to court to get rid of him. Consequently there is a fair amount of napping - or the moral equivalent of same - going on in Italy. Berlusconi proposed the teeniest of changes to the law: companies with 15 employees who wanted to add more would not have to abide by Article 18. Cofferati's reaction was a rather stagy outrage. He would not stand by as the rights of workers were trampled. He called a general strike. He called for a massive mobilisation of left-centre supporters. Millions participated. It was generally agreed that the symbolism of the campaign was far more important than the issue at stake: if Cofferati could stop Berlusconi on this most microscopic of clauses, he might stop Berlusconi on really important things. The outcome remains unclear. But at the very least someone has finally managed to beat Berlusconi at his own game: Cofferati had the simpler slogan. \"I will defend your job,\" he said. Berlusconi was left with the complicated, abstract notion that a less restrictive labour market would lead to a stronger economy. Berlusconi - whose campaign slogans tended to be of the LOWER TAXES, HIGHER PENSIONS variety - had been caught on the wrong side of grammar, trapped in a compound sentence. In person Cofferati is elegant and impossible. He sits in a lovely office, surrounded by modern art, overlooking the Borghese museum and gardens. He has the sort of perfectly arranged hair and precisely clipped beard that probably needs daily work by a flying squad of tonsorial specialists. He is wearing a dark suit, a pale green checked shirt with a button-down spread collar, a dark blue tie with matching braces. He speaks slowly, calmly. With even the slightest movement he emits a refreshing zephyr of talcum smell into the air. I find myself able to note all of these details because he says practically nothing of value. I ask about Berlusconi. \"I have nothing to say about Berlusconi,\" he says. I ask about the economic consequences of his position on labour flexibility. The problem isn't labour flexibility, he says. It is the failure of companies to spend more money on research and development. I ask about the rightwing political tide across Europe, and here he says something mildly interesting: \"The progressive forces in Europe are paying a high price for their support of a European Union that has emphasised the market aspects and not paid enough attention to social inequalities.\" But that's about as good as it gets. He's about to leave his union posi tion. Almost everyone believes he will enter politics, the candidate of the left wing of the centre-left coalition. He will not confirm this. After 26 years he is returning to work at Pirelli. Unfortunately his old job - inspecting the coating on wires - no longer exists. He will work in a corporate foundation, doing worthy things. (Translation: he's running for office.) As I exit the office, quite depressed, my semi-functioning mobile phone rings and there is surprising news: Berlusconi will see me. Rome - the boss If, as Michael Kinsley famously suggested, the gaffe is what happens when a politician accidentally tells the truth, what then is the formal interview? Quite the opposite, I suspect. It's certainly a difficult form for a journalist to master. Confrontation is almost always a disaster. Charm is useless. With Berlusconi, I will try jujitsu. Perhaps if I go with his strength - party-giving - I will be able to look into his soul. We are to meet in his private residence, which is, of course, stupendous, on a street near the Piazza Venezia, where Mussolini used to rant from a balcony. Berlusconi seems to anticipate my strategy. He provides interpreter Christine and me with vanilla ice cream as we wait for him. I have heard that President Bush loved the ice cream prepared by Berlusconi's chef, Michele Persechini. My first question will take off from there. He doesn't keep us waiting long. He sweeps in, smiling, dressed less ostentatiously than Cofferati. His old friend Confalonieri, down from Milan, is there, and several other aides. We move from a waiting room, with ceilings that appear higher than the millennium wheel, to an office with similar ceilings. \"I was speaking to Lady Thatcher a few years ago,\" he says immediately, taking control of things. \"She told me that she'd had 74 staff members at 10 Downing Street. Tony Blair had increased the number to 120. When I arrived here, I found 4,500 staff members. We've reduced that to 3,000.\" \"I understand that it's difficult to fire people in Italy,\" I say. He ignores me, produces a tri-coloured chart - \"primary colours\", he jokes - with the status of all 170 pieces of legislation he has filed. He begins an extended dissertation on the difficulties of passing legislation, of doing any sort of reform. \"Machiavelli said that reform is the most dangerous thing a leader can attempt,\" he says - and, as he pauses, I manage to insert my puny question about Bush and the ice cream. \"Yes, he loved it. Everyone loved it. I was standing with Putin at the ceremonies. Three jet fighters came trailing red, white and green smoke. Putin asked, 'Is this a military exercise?' I replied, 'No, it's the menu.' Everything was tricolore . The starter, the pasta, the ice cream.\" He doesn't want to linger on the party arrangements, though. He wants to talk about the pact with Russia, and about Putin. \"I had a very sincere conversation with Putin at the G8 meetings in Genoa. I saw his great worries about what would happen if the Americans abandoned the ABM treaty and if Nato was expanded. Russia felt surrounded. He was afraid that some of his colleagues were looking east, towards China, for an alliance. He was very concerned. And I thought, should I take a part in resolving this, or not? I worked with all our partners and with the American administration. I went to Moscow and talked to Putin for two days. At the end, a telephone call with Bush was arranged, and the decision was reached.\" He goes on about the details of the plan, and of his hopes to arrange $10bn in aid to the Russians over the next 10 years. Eventually I am able to change the topic and ask him about the general shift towards the right in Europe. \"Yes, there have been lousy results on the part of the socialists. Tony Blair is doing well because he has essentially followed Thatcher's path. You have to distinguish between the moderate left and the left left. Communism was a good idea with bad results. And there is great trauma to reforming a communist regime. Gorbachev came to visit me at my home when he was president of the Soviet Union, and he asked many questions. I was so pleased that he had opened his mind to new possibilities. Finally, I was escorting him and Raisa in to dinner and he said, 'There's one thing I don't understand, which authority fixes the prices?'\" Berlusconi smiles, but does not laugh at his own story. He is not quite larger than life one-on-one. But he is in command. Before he moves on, I sneak in a question about his own market-oriented reforms. I ask if Cofferati has beaten him on Article 18. He doesn't say no. He says: \"It's much easier to say 'I'm going to defend your job' than to say 'Your contract that says you can't be fired isn't a right; it's a privilege less than one-third of all workers in Italy have.'\" At this point, and for an extended period thereafter, he discusses his reforms, his budget, his successes, his plans. He is trying to convince me - contrary to the line from the left - that he is deeply involved in the details of governance and that he is succeeding with his plan. This is the sort of argument that is impossible for a visiting journalist from America to evaluate. But I assume that since he can't point to any grand victories, he hasn't had the success he would like. In the end, he tells this story: \"I was in Naples recently; 300,000 people came to hear me speak. I spoke for an hour and 20 minutes; they called out - Silvio! Silvio! - for four more encores. I was exhausted. I decided to stop in Naples for a pizza before I came home. We went to a restaurant and I heard a fabulous voice singing, a man with a guitar. I asked him to sing a very difficult song, 500 years old and he sang it. He said he knew thousands of songs. 'Do you ever write any yourself?' I asked. He said yes and sang three of them. The voice and the music were beautiful. The lyrics were terrible. I told him, 'I'll write some lyrics for you.' So, for 10 consecutive Saturday nights he came here, to my home, after midnight and we wrote 10 songs. We've made a CD.

I sang camp disco instead. More specifically, Gloria Gaynor's spirit urged me to sing \"I will survive\" at the top of my voice. Let me explain. Travelling to the island of Vulcano takes 24 hours; not so long you may think, but this sulphurous speck is only off the coast of Sicily. After faffing around in Rome airport, I eventually touched down in Palermo where I stayed at the Excelsior Hotel overnight. A word of advice: don't make the same mistake as me. It was nothing more than a palatial boarding house hung with grandiose chandeliers, even bigger pretensions and staffed with the surliest, most unpleasant personnel I've ever come across. Next day didn't come soon enough, and I transferred to Milazzo to get a boat to Vulcano. The tiny island (population 800) is extraordinary. The smell of sulphur precedes it and scents the air with strange aromatics long before you arrive. I understand it has its good and bad days; during my first visit the stench was stimulating, to say the least; this time it was a gentle - if sometimes farty - constant. There are few guesthouses and hotels to choose from (I stayed at Hotel les Sables Noir). The best beach on the island is here; it's a dramatic sweep of coal-black sand that curls towards the jaggedy rocks of nearby cliffs. This is possibly the best place to swim off the island, too, as the ocean isn't that accessible from other parts. The hotel is simple, clean and cheerfully run, and meals can be had on their beautiful patio overlooking the sea. Or, if you're feeling like a little cabaret, I'm sure they wouldn't mind you having a tinkle on the white grand piano. It was an incongruously camp addition to the establishment. But looming above all of this, like a poisonous slagheap puking a continuous stream of sulphurous gases into the atmosphere, is the volcano. It is an ominous sight even though the big boy is extinct now. He's not blown his top for over a century. The main reason for visiting Vulcano is to bathe in the mud pool and to hike across the elemental landscape. It's the crude nature of the place that is so beguiling. The mud pool bubbles up warm slurry that reeks of fermenting hops. Its reputation relies on the curative powers of the silver sludge (claimed to be particularly beneficial for arthritic and respiratory problems). Beyond the mud pool, it's possible to bathe in a naturally heated part of the sea to rid yourself of your all-over face pack - the water actually boils in places. It costs €1 a session. Preparation for mountaineering was simple; I'd been told that it shouldn't take more than 45 minutes to reach the top of the volcano; it was hardly Everest and a guide wasn't needed. A lovely hot, spring morning; slip into sand-coloured linens and sandals and swish off up the hill. The world was perfect, nature had been given a wake-up call and spring was zingy. Large, vibrant green lizards and bumblebees the size of ping-pong balls were busy in the undergrowth, and spring flowers held the air to ransom with a heady scent of cinnamon (overpowering the more usual chemical whiff). I bumped into folk on their way back down the mountainside dressed in serious hiking boots and cagoules. \"Get a life,\" I thought, muttering to myself something about this being clambering for urbanites, and scampered (not quite in the manner of a fashionable mountain goat) to the summit. Nothing prepared me for the crater's edge: Dante eat your heart out. Curling tendrils of steam rose into the air on clouds of chemical gauze. It was much more dramatic than I imagined it to be. I stood behind a chrome yellow fumarole that blasted out a geyser of hot, damp, stinking air and attempted to walk through it. My breath was taken away by the outrageous stench and the knowledge that there was one hell of a drop just to my right. The sulphur started to smell like bitter coffee and the wisdom of flip-flops was questioned. Walking around the crater became a scramble as the path rose at a steep angle through a mixture of sand, shale, pumice and shingle. I got a little antsy about the state of the linens but persevered until 15m from the summit, where I took a proprietorial look at the magnificence below me. I squealed and sat down on the edge of the precipice; I was petrified. Returning the way I came wasn't an option; I would have to head on around. First I was afraid, I was petrified. That seemed to ring a bell. I was going to survive. The spirit of Gloria Gaynor entered me at my most vulnerable. It wasn't what I expected. Stories of ethereal beauty normally unite those who face uncertain death. Being possessed by a campy old disco diva doesn't figure large in the pantheon of spiritual near misses. She did with me, though, and I edged my way back to safety. Supper, and the best place for it is Maurizio's. You can't miss it; just up from the harbour on the left. The carpaccio of swordfish was so-so, but the ravioli of lobster was pretty much top notch as was the spaghetti alle vongole and the valpolicella. The waiter couldn't have been more helpful or theatrical if he'd tried. Allow yourself about €40 a head for a blow-out dinner with wine. On to Stromboli (the last island in the chain, population 500) and the only one to have an active volcano. The island is car-less because the streets are too narrow to let them pass. It was designed for donkeys. At the top of the village is the church of San Vincenzo, a shop that rents out the correct gear for volcano climbing (which I ignore) and a café (which I don't). I was served pizza in a basket; I kid you not. This small area is essentially the main drag as most of the bars are up here; I'd urge you to try a bar/ restaurant called Roma on the Via. Great view, old-fashioned service and vodkas served by the litre for pennies. My hotel, La Sirenetta, was situated on the seafront near to the posher part of the village. Dolce and Gabanna are summertime neighbours, so it must be classy. After Vulcano, my approach to the beast on Stromboli was fretful. Anyone considering a climb of this dangerous peak must do so with a local guide. They can be easily arranged through your hotel for either day or night-time hikes. I decided on a decorous, unguided tour and headed up a stone pathway to the base to the growling monster in the early evening. If I were lucky, I' d see the volcano glow red in the dark from afar. I wasn't convinced; I was also cold, hungry and a little miserable. I had persuaded myself it was too cloudy, there would be nothing to see; dinner at the hotel would be a much better option. I only looked up by chance and saw it - the hillside puked up its molten guts. I sat on a wall and waited for Stromboli to get bilious again, hoping it would do so sooner rather than later as hypothermia was threatening to do me in. I gave it another five minutes and wasn' t disappointed. Its great orange firework display fingered the night sky and enthralled the lone spectator huddled on the slopes below. Returning was difficult, not because of life threatening plunges into the abyss but because of constantly looking back in the hope of seeing just a little bit more of nature' s most exciting show on earth.

Huseyin Ozer Owner of Ozer and Sofra restaurants and bar Incognico, 117 Shaftesbury Avenue, London WC2 'It's light, healthy and delicious.' Sally Clarke, Clarke's Le Fournil, Place Carnot 84480 Bonnieux, France 'They have a beautiful outside terrace.It is perfect for summer as it is family- friendly so I took my two-year-old. The food and the atmosphere there are so good that it's the sort of place you want to keep a secret.' Rowley Leigh Kensington Place, London W8 'I don't know really. It would be ridiculous to say my own restaurant but that's the only place that I've been for the past year.' John Torode, Smiths of Smithfield Chez Bruce, 2 Bellevue Road, London SW17 'My best meal was a bowl of spaghetti with clams and chilli on a boat in Menorca - but as for a restaurant I had a great lunch at Chez Bruce this year. We had great food, and Jason, the sommelier, looked after us on the wine side; he's just fabulous, and we fell out of there at about 5pm.' Maureen Mills, restaurant PR consultant Les Ambassadeurs restaurant at Le Crillon Hotel, 10, Place de la Concorde, 75008 Paris 'The seven-hour cooked lamb is the best dish I have had - ever. The menu is simple, but technically perfect, comfort food.' Rose Gray, co-owner and chef at The River Café Trattoria Da Marino, Via Provinciale Lucchese 102 51030 Serravalle Pistoiese, Italy 'I've had all my best meals out of England and love Da Marino in Tuscany. It's very informal and they do the most delicious gnudi which is buffalo ricotta with sage butter and parmesan. In Britain I can't help but go back to the classic restaurants. My favourite few are St John, Kensington Place and Moro, but out of those I'd pick Kensington Place because it is near my house.' Dylan Jones, editor of GQ magazine Isola, London SW1 'It would have to be the new basement bistro, Osteria, part of the Isola Restaurant in Knightsbridge. The chef, Bruno Loubet, is a genius. It has the best starter - beetroot ravioli - I've eaten it dozens and dozens of times. It is also one of the few restaurants that serves Prosecco, an Italian alternative to Champagne, which is just as good if not better. It's the best interior of any restaurant in London: very modern, very luxurious, very now and also very snug.' Chris Bodker, co-owner of Kensington Place, Launceston Place, Brackenberry and West Street Assaggi, 39 Chepstow Place, London W2 'The food is outstanding and run by pair of first class, charming, professional, committed Italian restaurateurs. I've been there half a dozen times this year.' John Tagholm, director of BDP Media making food programmes for BBC UK Food channel Delphina's, Bermondsey Street, London SE1 'It's not open in the evenings but the food, especially the sea food, is excellent and Maria Elias, the young chef, is very inventive with her small menu. Best value is Mustoe's Bistro in Primrose Hill Village where it appears that the prices haven't gone up since opening day in the Sixties. Best evening nosh, Incognico.' Richard Harden, editor of Harden's restaurant guide Champor-Champor, 62 Weston St, London SE1 'What I liked about it was that it provided different food - it's eclectic, mainly Asian, quality cooking at reasonable prices. It's not a themed restaurant, but more of a small trendy local for those in the know.' Shaun Hill, Merchant House, Ludlow The Walnut Tree, Abergavenny, Monmouthshire 'It has changed hands recently from Franco Taruschio, who was there for 37 years, to Stephen Terry. Terry made a big noise in London and worked with Marco Pierre White and Gordon Ramsay and has managed to keep The Walnut Tree's heritage. It's still got the lovely feeling - the atmosphere there counts as much as the food, but the dishes are Stephen Terry's and they are very good.' Jay Rayner, Observer restaurant critic Lords of the Manor, Upper Slaughter, Glos; The Fat Duck, Bray, Berkshire 'I ate only two truly great meals this year. One was at Lords of the Manor in Upper Slaughter, where chef John Campbell put together vivid and uncompromising flavours. He has now moved to the Vineyard at Stockcross which has to be worth a trip. But the one that will linger in the memory is the dinner I ate at The Fat Duck in Bray. Readers can be forgiven for becoming bored of the constant references to its chef-patron Heston Blumenthal. They may wonder whether media hype is now involved. As far as I am concerned it would be dishonest of me not to pick him. He is pushing back the gastronomic boundaries like nobody else in this country.' Richard Neat, chef of Oxo Tower and Neat Le Galion, boulevard Croisette, 06400 Cannes 'My wife and I ate there every week when I was living in Cannes and I was working in my restaurant there. It has nice food, incredibly friendly staff and it is on the beach. We loved it.' Tim Atkin, The Observer's wine critic Chez Bruce, 2 Bellevue Road, London SW17 'The best sort of neighbourhood restaurant: great service, a very well chosen wine list and some of the best food south of the river.' Luke Johnson, owner of Belgo group including The Ivy, Caprice, J. Sheekey Fishbar, 2-4 Fearnhead Road, W9 'Am I not allowed to mention any of the ones I'm involved in? Well, it's really a takeaway called Fishbar that was recently opened at the junction of Elgin Avenue and Harrow Road. It's basically a posh fish and chip shop. It sells quality fish and wine and there is a fresh fish shop which sells delicious exotic shellfish. And I'm nothing to do with it.' Alan Crompton-Batt, restaurant PR Deanes Restaurant, 36-40 Howard Street, Belfast 'I always say the Ivy, and so does everyone else but this year I loved Deanes in Belfast, and although he is a friend I think Robert Reid at The OakRoom is the most underrated chef around.(I visit Wagamama in secret!)' Jane Clarke, Observer nutritionist Lindsay House, London W1 'Wonderful, skilfully executed food for times when you fancy a night of pure indulgence. I love the fact that the table's yours for the evening, none of this two- hour nonsense, so all in all, it's my very favourite eatery.' Elizabeth Crompton-Batt, PR St John, London EC1 'Apart from my few clients, which are places that I like to eat in a lot of the time, it would probably be St John. The food is very simple and beautifully prepared and presented. It is so good that you want to eat there over and over again.' Roger Alton, Editor of The Observer The Quality Chop House, London, EC1 and Pizza Express 'A kid's view of life, whereby you just do the same thing repeatedly until you get tired of it, always seems to me a good model, so two old favourites here. For work, the Quality Chop House, a mere stumble up Farringdon Road is the best works canteen possible. Not that cheap, and you'll get a sore bum on its famously uncomfortable wood benches. But not to be missed. And for absolute sure-fire reliability, Pizza Express. Best chain in the world without question, and unfailingly brilliant staff who always make you feel welcome, though God knows what they're paid. It even survived putting a few new pizzas on the menu recently (something called Sloppy Giuseppi, and a Soho) which was a bit like putting the Turin Shroud in the wash.'","Id":"lifeandstyle/2001/dec/09/foodanddrink.features14","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webTitle":"The best meal of the year was...","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/dec/09/foodanddrink.features14","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2001/dec/09/foodanddrink.features14","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":1614,"webPublicationDate":"2001-12-09T16:32:56Z","id":"lifeandstyle/2001/dec/09/foodanddrink.features14","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Sex, stilettos and the Fiat 500","body":"1. The screen goddess Italian stars and starlets specialised in exaggerated busts in the films of the 50s and 60s. Whether part-bared or barely concealed under implausibly tight jumpers (scuola de Gina Lollobrigida), they jutted them out towards the camera with all the thrusting aggression of Sherman tanks attacking Monte Cassino. With each passing year, the search was on for more imposing breasts. The zenith was reached in Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita (1960). The Swedish blonde bombshell Anita Ekberg stole several scenes, most notably when she splashed around in the Fontana di Trevi in a black dress that was a work of bravura structural engineering. Here was the bust as all-conquering weapon in the war of love. This screen image was deflated in the stick-thin 60s and has remained unfashionable pretty much ever since, although doubtless Italians will demur. 2. The Vespa When I hear the word Vespa, I think of raven-haired girls in fashionable sunglasses perched pouting on a vespiary of motor-scooters in the Piazza Navona. I think of Nanni Moretti's curiously touching film Dear Diary , in which the director stars, riding his scooter in search of the subtopian wasteland where Pier Paolo Pasolini, director of the provocative Pigsty (1969) and Decameron (1970), was murdered. I am spirited into any number of narrow streets where these characterful vespines create an urban soundtrack as Italian as any by Verdi. How they buzz like the wasps they are named after. How, like wasps, they evoke Italian holidays, all wind-in-the-hair switchbacks along the Amalfi coast in search of the perfect ice cream, coffee and beach. Where the Vespa (wasp) is for play and display, the Ape (bee), its droning three-wheeled sibling, is for work and delay. Api are used as mobile coffee bars in London. There should be more of them. They put us in a holiday frame of mind, transport us on overcast mornings, along with the smell of good, strong espresso, to Piazza Navona. Sharpness is a way of life in Italy. Sharp dressing, sharp talking, sharp design. Sharpest of all is the stiletto - small and tapered, sneaky and treacherous. It is designed to cause maximum effect by minimal means. The word stiletto derives from stylus, a sharp point or pen. It applies, too, to the spiked heel that goes by the same name. This device is used by women (and men in drag) to make holes in wooden floors at cocktail parties, and to rick their own tendons and toes. On the other hand, the stiletto heel is also genuinely sexy, as is the sharpness of style it gives shape to. Italy is the land of the stiletto-sharp suit from Armani, stiletto-sharp haircuts and the stiletto-sharp and much sought after furniture of Gio Ponti and Carlo Mollino. 4. Football The Italian game is driven less by business goals or the work ethic than English football. Football in Italy is about the intense, age-old rivalry between cities. It's about the beautiful pass, the beautiful goal, the beautiful result. And yet... Italian football, although operatic, exciting and played increasingly in magnificent stadia like the San Siro (pictured above) that resemble the Colosseum brought up to date, is not as civilised as it might be. It is riven by racism, besmirched with the fag-end of fascism. For all its beauty, Italian football can be an ugly game. 5. The opera Swaggering, lyrical, sensual, absurdist... Italian opera is the ritualised chorus of Italian cities at their full-blooded, baroque best. Watching opera in Italy - Aida at the Roman arena in Verona and Tosca at the Opera House, Naples have been my favourites - means being cento-per-cento involved in the drama, music and song. Imagine an Italian audience's rapt reaction to Pavarotti singing 'O Sole Mio'. The musical equivalent, at its best, of a Brunelleschi church, at its worst of the Vittorio Emannuele monument in Rome (the 'Typewriter' as Romans know it; this vast 19th-century white marble conceit was used as a spectacular prop in Peter Greenaway's Belly of an Architect), opera is both glorious and kitsch. Like the great cities it is performed in, Italian opera offers high art and low camp, magnificent voices and pitiful acting, great music and banal dialogue. It is also utterly seductive. 6. La Bella Figura Sit in a café in any Italian street just before sunset and watch what must be the world's only daily carnival pass by: the passegiata . This is the time of day when Italy struts its own stage, when people, with the exception of a few teenagers and students trying hard to revolt (pretending they prefer McDonald's to what is without doubt among the world's finest food, whether fast or slow, cooked or raw), dress up, look good and go on show. This is the time for men to show clodhopping foreigners how to walk with fine tweed jackets draped immaculately over their shoulders, for men and women to demonstrate how to tie a canary yellow jumper around your neck without it looking anything less than studied. A time to practise hand language of a complexity that might baffle a top code-breaker. A time to stop every so often in the middle of the street to address your audience, even if it consists of just one person, with grand shrugs and expansive gestures. It's impossible to have enough of the passegiata . What you see, and unless appearances are truly deceptive, is a people at home with itself. It is an immensely attractive quality. Every man is Michelangelo's David, every woman a Bellini Madonna or Botticelli angel. Bello. Bella. Belli. 7. The Spaghetti Western American cowboy movies filmed in the Spanish sierras and often badly dubbed, the Spaghetti Western is one of the most endearing products of Italian cinema. The Spaghetti Western was, of course, the making of Clint Eastwood, who starred in Il Bueno, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly , 1966) and other films directed by Sergio Leone, who went on to make such magnificent films as Once Upon a Time in the West (1969). What these films have in common, aside from out-of-synch lip action (this is not true of the later films) and a cast of regular actors, is an operatic quality. The scores of Ennio Morricone, whistling and whip-cracking, are even more unforgettable than many of the visual sequences and live performances are sell-outs. Eastwood learnt many of the lessons of how to imbue even the slowest moments in Westerns with electric tension. Sequences in which time was deliberately slowed down to heighten the drama to come - as in, say, a scene of a bank held still for several moments before it blows up - were brilliant studies in release and tension. Even though his films were operatic, Leone introduced a sense of dirt, dust and danger that has long since found its way into the best American Westerns. The US influence on Italy, as on much of the rest of western Europe, has been huge since the Yanks landed in Sicily with British and Commonwealth forces and drove the Nazis and Fascists out of the peninsula. The Spaghetti Westerns are a kind of homage to the US. The Good Guys win, which is not always the case in Italian opera. 8. The Fiat 500 Designed by the mellifluously named Dante Giacosa, the 1957 Fiat 500 was the successor to the pre-war Topolino, the little mouse. If ever a car looked like Mickey Mouse it was the Topolino. The joke, in various guises, continued through the curvy, cartoon-like design of Giacosa's Cinquecento; there was an open-top version available in the 60s that looked exactly like Noddy's car. It even came in bright red and yellow paintwork. It was a nice joke, for here was a car hardly bigger than a toy and a hoot to drive. The early versions of Giacosa's micro-car featured hand-throttles (there was a foot pedal, too). This meant you could motor across Sicilian beaches while sitting on top of the seat back, bare feet on the cushion, head sticking out of the canvas sunshine roof, but still able to steer, with the car buzzing around in Scalextric-style figures-of-eight at a set throttle. In town, the Cinquecento could squeeze through the most tightly corseted street. You could park it nose or tail towards the pavement in unlikely gaps between Lancias and Alfa Romeos. It could thrum along all day at 80kph laden down with mama, papa, bambini and groceries. It was reliable, frugal and possessed of a perky charm. There were racing versions (Abarth), estate cars and a seaside version with cutaway doors and wicker seats. I have written this in the past tense, yet Fiat 500s are as highly prized today in Sienna or Salerno as Morris Minors are in Sussex. There has never been a better Italian town car than the 500, nor a car this side of a Ferrari Daytona or Lamborghini Miura that so emphatically says 'Italy', and even more so, the Italian city. The very name Fiat expresses it: Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino. 9. The Renaissance The Renaissance was, in the words of the great French scholar Emile Male, 'Antiquity ennobled by the Christian faith', beginning with Brunelleschi's dome over the crossing of Florence Cathedral and Piero della Francesca's perspective paintings, most famously the Flagellation [of Christ]. Renaissance and Italian ideas spread across Europe with the simultaneous invention of moveable type and the printed book. From then on, there was a bit of Italy and the Renaissance in London, Liège, Lyons and Lubeck. A new love affair with Italy had begun, reflected not only in painting and architecture but in literature, music, if all too slowly in food. It may have been kick-started and ridden for all it was worth by the church, yet the Renaissance had its decidely pagan and sinful moments. Just look at the paintings of Luca Signorelli, who lived and worked in Urbino in the last years of Federico da Montefeltro's reign and in the Florence of Lorenzo the Magnificent. He knew there was more to art than religion. There was sex, violence and fashion, too. His Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian is as camp as they come. As for Signorelli's cycle of paintings in Orvieto Cathedral, avert the eyes of impressionable bambini. In these lurid designs of abused naked men and women, the painter even portrays himself as a devil. In his Lives of the Artists (1550), Giorgio Vasari tells us that Signorelli lived well and dressed elegantly, which is an alternative way of describing the Italian Renaissance itself. Its elegant, well-dressed works are, happily, inescapable. 10. The fast lane Fast is a way of life in Italy. It starts with the language. Words like rapido, espresso, pizza, Ducati, Ferrari and 'vamenos' (let's go) sound so very fast. But, then an espresso coffee is fast, ordered quickly, served rapidly and drunk in a heavily sugared gulp or two. Fast food (fast to cook, that is) is an Italian speciality: pizza, pasta, gnocchi. Fast cars are synonymous with the sibilant and other wise tongue-tripping names of Italian manufacturers: Maserati, Ferrari, Lamborghini. Even cultural revolutions have been about rapid movement. The Futurists, an iconoclastic group of poets, writers and artists fronted by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, were crazy about speed. 'We affirm,' wrote Marinetti in 1909, 'that the world's magnificence has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed.' The young architect Antonio Sant'Elia (1888-1916) inspired generations of Italian architects with his visionary schemes for futuristic cities. His imaginary Citta' Nuova (1914) centred on a transport hub combining railway lines, motorways and an airport on its roof. Every line Sant'Elia drew expressed irrepressible energy. These designs influenced such dramatic buildings as the Fiat factory, Turin. Giacomo Matte-Trucco began work on this compelling structure in 1920: he included a race-track on its roof. The factory has since been converted into a cultural and exhibition centre by the Genoese architect Renzo Piano although the race-track is sadly out of bounds. The Futurists were a racy influence on Benito Mussolini's Fascists; it was no coincidence that when the Italian dictator marched on Rome, he was photographed running.

In Milan, marchers flung raw meat through police lines, splattering restaurant windows with blood. But most of the protests were more peaceful, with crowds in Rome, Naples, Palermo and Turin chanting: \"Better a day of tortellini than 100 days of hamburgers.\" Organisers of the protests have said they will intensify their campaign, predicting that Italy will overtake France in the strength of its opposition to the chain. The government promised to set up a task force to draw up a charter of principles for multinational companies. The charter, to be agreed with trade unions, was intended to defuse hostility by acting as a \"civic defender\", said the industry minister, Enrico Letta. He added: \"It would be a mistake to create a climate of tension. McDonald's is one of the few foreign companies bringing investment to our country.\" A coalition of leftwing radicals, family-run bars and trade unions hopes to reverse, or at least slow down, McDonald's planned opening of 200 outlets in the next two years. It says the chain is destroying consumer choice, exploiting staff andselling unhealthy food. McDonald's responds that it is employing 15,000 young people and has become hugely popular with families since opening its first restaurant in Rome 15 years ago. The countrywide protests were bolstered by controversy over the chain's treatment of staff. Last week, 20 employees in Florence walked out in protest at an \"intimidating\" work climate. Around the same time a manager in Florence raised hackles by disciplining an employee for sipping a soft drink without permission. The worker complained to his union, which complained to the labour minister, Cesare Salvi. After meeting the minister, the president of McDonald's in Italy, Mario Resca, promised an inquiry. \"The respect and valour of each of our employees is of the highest priority to McDonald's,\" he said, adding that the new outlets would create 10,000 jobs. The chain, which has 272 restaurants in Italy, suffered another blow when trade unions mobilised to defend five employees reprimanded for eating chocolate chips. Earlier this month Fausto Bertinotti, leader of the Refounded Communist party, led 100,000 protesters to a McDonald's branch in Piazza della Repubblica in Rome. Branding its hamburgers a symbol of Americanisation and globalisation, he said he understood why people physically attacked the restaurants. The Turin-based Slow Food movement, which champions traditional cooking and eating, joined yesterday's protests. Its spokesman, Silvio Barbero, told the Corriere della Sera newspaper: \"It forces consumers to taste the same hamburger in Tokyo, New York, Helsinki and Palermo. A McDonald's hamburger doesn't evoke regional tastes or sensations, and its gastronomic origin is impossible to define.\" Ghettoised for years with a combined market share of 5%, McDonald's and Burger King resolved to bring Italy up to the European average of 25%. Food purists said Italians would never succumb, but they were wrong, with pasta salads and pizza slices boosting the chains' popularity. Digested history of McProtest • In the 1980s, McDonald's faced protests in the west after rumours that its beef came from cattle raised on cleared rainforest in South and Central America. The firm quickly clarified the situation - it demands proof from its suppliers that they use only long-established cattle ranches and 100% EU beef. But the myth lives on. • In Britain, the 'David and Goliath' McLibel case began in 1994 and saw the company successfully sue Dave Morris and Helen Steel for allegations they made in a leaflet in the late 80s. It became the longest libel case in English history, lasting over two and a half years and costing McDonald's £10m. • In summer this year, a French farmer, Jose Bove, roused Gallic sympathy when he was jailed for three months for attacking a half-built McDonald's in Millau, southern France. He was protesting against US duties on French cheese and the 'McDomination of the world'. • It took 13 years for McDonald's to establish a presence on Hampstead High Street, north London, after celebrity opposition from the likes of Melvyn Bragg, Tom Conti and Margaret Drabble","Id":"world/2000/oct/17/rorycarroll1","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Protesters try to halt rise of fast-food giant in Italy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/oct/17/rorycarroll1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/oct/17/rorycarroll1","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":691,"webPublicationDate":"2000-10-17T01:20:03Z","id":"world/2000/oct/17/rorycarroll1","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"The cheapest way to travel round Italy","body":"· Youth Hostels are the cheapest accommodation option depending on the age of your child: £10 per night and free breakfast, but you have to be a \"youth\".

For good hotel prices, go to the hotel booking service in the main railway station in central Rome. They have good vacancies for Florence/Rome/Pisa/Naples for that day and subsequent days only. In the middle of June, they booked me a room at the Hotel Montreal (centrally located and very nice) for half the usual rate. Pisa is much cheaper to stay than Florence and is only a half hour away by train. Use sleepers to save on accommodation if travelling south to north. They are pleasantly surprisingly good and leave you money to maybe splash out on a better hotel the next day. For cheap food, avoid heavy tourist areas and check out the quiet trattorias and pizza joints - lovely food, very cheap.

For transport do not neglect the buses, which go where the trains can't - into the hills - and also many places they don't (usually where there are lots of small towns but few cities). As there is no national bus service comparable to the national rail network, the buses are little local or regional lines, and they get short shrift. Same is true in France.

Thirty-two years ago, advised to spend some time in the sun for her health, Seed closed her eyes and stuck a pin in a map of Europe. Her aim took her to Terrachina, just south of Rome, where began two love affairs - one with a handsome Italian gynaecologist, the other with Italy. Soon, she moved to Rome. She spent 15 years teaching English, while pursuing her untrained love of cooking in every market, shop and restaurant she could find. In 1987, her book Top 100 Pasta Sauces sold a million copies and has been followed by eight titles on Italian and Indian cookery. She has become Italian food expert for Marks & Spencer and works for the International Olive Oil Council. Seed realised that the network of friends and colleagues she had built up across the country made her uniquely placed to offer tours exploring the authentic cookery on which she is now an authority. Four years ago, she put on her first trip to the 'heel' of Italy, and now offers trips to Puglia (Greek influence, the best pasta, great veg), Rome (seasonal selections from all over the country), Sicily (wildly diverse influences - French, Arab, Spanish) and Campania, taking in the Amalfi coast and Naples. It was on the latter trip that I joined Seed and 14 tourists from Australia, America and the UK, with a range of foodie credentials - from restaurant writers to world shopping champions with a taste for culture and a great meal. After a welcome dinner at Seed's apartment in a Roman palazzo, we moved to our mountain base, in Sant'Agata Sui Due Golfi. This region traditionally has a 'Mediterranean' diet, rich in vegetables, pasta, fish and olive oil, much trumpeted for the health benefits 'discovered' by US professor Ancel Keyes. 'The idea of the happy peasant skipping around the Italian hills bursting with health has become something of a legend,' says Seed, 'and that kind of diet is now more the domain of privileged Americans and Australians. Trattorias serving that traditional, simple cooking are dying out in Italy's cities. But I have found family-run places which hand secret recipes down from generation to generation.' Our first lesson, in the kitchen of a secluded seafront restaurant at the end of an unmade road, had as its centrepiece a fish simply baked in a huge crust of rock salt and drizzled with an olive oil and lemon juice dressing. More controversial, however, was the pasta course, the regional speciality of spaghetti con zucchini. Two families have confidentially claimed authorship of this famous recipe to Seed, and we came no closer to knowing its secrets that night. As we left the restaurant, she said with a sigh: 'They left something out of the zucchini sauce on purpose. That's how much rivalry there is here. Oh well, shan't ask them to teach that again.' The next day, our teacher was another family-trained local restaurateur, the sister-in-law of our hostess from the night before. As she showed us how to prepare green tomato and pecorino sauce, tomato and aubergine sauce, an antipasti selection, huntsman's-style chicken and a salad, she rolled her eyes good-naturedly at our tale of the great zucchini swindle and gave her version of the story. 'When my restaurant closed for a year for refurbishment,' she told us, 'I helped out in their kitchen. The chefs watched over my shoulder and stole my secret touches. But they made sure I never saw exactly what they were doing!' Other excursions included a trip to a tiny bungalow in a mountain village, boasting a Tardis-like handmade mozzarella plant in the front room. The hands of the family who run it are alarmingly scarlet from years of plunging them into near-boiling water to work the just-fermented cheese into its characteristic texture. A batch of the local hooch, limoncello, was prepared for us, and a trip to a food market in central Naples had half our group transfixed as a feisty little octopus made repeated breaks for freedom from his washing-up bowl on a seafood stall. Alan, we called him. Afternoons off allowed excursions to many nearby hotspots - Capri, Sorrento, Amalfi, Positano and Ravello are all within easy reach. There were even a few opportunities to dress up of an evening, with visits to two of the swankiest restaurants in the area - one of which, Sant'Agata's triple-starred Michelin Don Alfonso, provided a spectacular seven-course blowout on our last night. Not that Seed has sold out her peasant side. 'This isn't trendy cooking,' she says. 'I can't bear pretension about food.' But the trip's greatest asset is Seed's own encyclopaedic knowledge of everything from the region's mythological significance to the best gelati café in Sorrento, to the slightly racy rumours about the lineage of the Oriental-looking chef in the next village. Being in the party of 'La Signora Inglese', as she is known across Italy, guarantees you at least an extra helping of charm and, more often than not, an extra course or two. As she prepared to drop us off in Naples for some sightseeing, Seed pointed out a famous cake shop.'The first cakes sold in Naples were made in convents and sold to raise money for the church,' she told us. 'It's said that the nuns would spread out the flour, eggs and sugar mixture on marble benches and sit on the dough, chanting as they worked it with their bare cheeks.'

Two valuable pieces of life advice that I'm wilfully discarding, except that technically this is not a date, it's an interview, obviously. But when you're at a table for two with a handsome Italian in a sleek suit watching attentively as you try to hold a conversation while grappling with a fresh molten pizza the size of a London borough, it's difficult not to feel acutely self-conscious about whether there are bits of rocket stuck in your teeth. Roberto Di Matteo, the Chelsea midfielder with 26 caps for Italy, who made history first with his £4.9 million transfer from Lazio in 1996, and then with the fastest ever FA Cup Final goal (in 1997 after 42 seconds), is not eating but scrutinising every forkful I pick up, which makes it even trickier. 'It's all right, the pizza?' he asks anxiously, leaning forward. So I nod vigorously, hoping to convey that it's very much all right, the pizza, in fact it's excellent, and if I'm not eating as heartily as he might have hoped, it's only because I'm concerned to maintain a little poise by not dropping hot mozzarella down my front. Inside Baraonda, Di Matteo's latest restaurant venture which opened last October in Heddon Street, W1, candles flicker against the orange-washed arching walls and the air is thick with the smells of basil and garlic. You might almost imagine yourself in Tuscany, if London were not in the grip of a Narnian eternal winter, with sheets of would-be snow sluicing down the glass. 'When the weather's better we'll have tables outside,' Di Matteo says, gesturing carelessly to the pedestrianised area through the window. 'I think it will look quite Mediterranean.' We glance up at the belligerent sky and he smiles. 'Maybe. With a bit of imagination.' Baraonda ('It means \"chaos\". We liked that idea') is the second restaurant Di Matteo has opened with his business partner Roberto Caravona, after the success of Friends in Chelsea's Hollywood Road, his professional manor. 'Basically it was going well so we thought we would try another one in the West End. When we first saw this place, it was just the four walls. We had to do everything. All the ideas for the decor, we thought of them.' With Beckham leading by example, it's not unusual these days to find Premier League footballers mingling with pop personalities and barely pubescent MTV presenters in many of London's celebrity restaurants, but Di Matteo is in a different category. A love of food and the carefully tuned ambience of a good restaurant have been an integral part of his life since childhood, and it's not just about being seen in the right company; you can't imagine any English player manifesting a similar level of excitement over the minutiae of interior design. 'You see these tiles?' - he taps the thick brick-red slabs with the tip of his immaculately glossy shoes as he leads me towards the stairs - 'these came from a farm that was being demolished in Tuscany. We bought the whole lot and had them brought over. And these little dishes, we put the olives in these. They are hand painted from Sicily. All the ingredients we import from Italy - apart from the fresh produce, of course. We really want it to be authentic.' Even the chef, Fabio Rossi, is imported - 'We found him in Rome,' Di Matteo says over his shoulder, descending towards the basement bar and the kitchen. 'He used to work for a very famous restaurant there, La Pergola, and we approached him. He was very happy to come over for this adventure.' Rossi is small and slight and has a Tolkienesque air about him, scuttling round his underground kitchen, stirring and smelting and producing several dozen miraculous-looking things at once while chatting on all four cylinders in Italian. 'What is this?' Di Matteo glances into a saucepan and turns to me. 'Oh - sformato di melanzane con sfogliatina ai funghi porcini - you have to try one of these, it's fantastic.' I have no idea what's just been ordered and I'm really not hungry, but I don't want to be ungrateful so I smile witlessly and say 'Gracias', which doesn't fool anybody. 'Food was always such an important part of my family life when I was growing up,' he says thoughtfully, back upstairs in the main restaurant with a refilled glass of the ripe house red - me, not him. 'I won't have a drink now, I have to be careful.' He grins, and leans back, spreading his arms out over the back of the bench against the window. 'I mean, you can drink in moderation, the same with eating, but I am in here maybe three or four times a week and I have to watch my figure. Where was I?' Family. 'Oh, yes. Well, I grew up in Switzerland where my parents were immigrant workers, but my whole family are very good cooks - my father also. So I always saw my parents enjoying to cook and prepare the food. In Italy it's such a big social function too, you know - when you meet all your friends you invite them for dinner or you go out to dinner. We use food very much for socialising and that is what I wanted in starting a restaurant.' So was this always a dream that existed alongside the hopes of footballing glory? 'It was something I always wanted to do, to own a restaurant, because I love food. But particularly when I first moved to London, because I was on my own - I was single, away from my family, so it seemed very important, to have a place where you could go to meet friends and eat.' Hence the name of the first restaurant, I suppose. 'Yes. I got in touch with Roberto when I first arrived because we had a mutual friend in Rome and he had been in London for a few years, so this guy suggested he should show me around. So we became good friends. And I'll tell you how the idea came up - it was the summer of '97 and we were sitting in Hyde Park one day, we were both single and away from home, and we said \"I wish we could just start a business, a little place where we can go and have dinner in the evenings\" - because we used to eat out every night. We didn't think about making money, you know? As long as it didn't lose money. Because we're both doing it for a hobby - he runs an accommodation agency, so it was really just for fun. So we opened the one in Chelsea.' Just then, my next course arrives; it turns out to be a stuffed aubergine pie with layers of wild mushroom. It smells great, but I'm still as stuffed as the aubergine; it's beginning to feel like visiting my relatives at Christmas, only with better food. 'You don't have to eat all of it,' he says, kindly. 'Just try some.' The menu is largely modern European - sea bass, monkfish, calves' liver, salmon, lamb and various kinds of pasta - and the main restaurant boasts a corner with a wood-fired pizza oven where diners can watch Fabrizio, the pizza chef, demonstrating his art. 'We discuss our ideas for the food with the chef and then we decide together what will work on the menu,' Di Matteo says. 'We wanted to do something different with this restaurant - Friends is more traditional Italian, and we wanted this to be something more modern. I usually have the calves' liver when I come here, it's very good. Or the seafood risotto. Or pizza - my favourite is this one, we call it Baraonda - it's rocket salad, cherry tomatoes, Parma ham and buffalo mozzarella.' He also chose several of the wines on the list. 'This one, Montepulciano D'Abruzzo D.O.C - my parents are from Abruzzo. Or this is a very good one, or thisÉ' he points them out. Perhaps the most striking aspect of Baraonda is that it's affordable - he hasn't remotely set out to create a showground for celebrities and hangers on, though when he's not at his own restaurants he visits the usual places - Nobu, San Lorenzo, Scalini. The average main course at Baraonda is around £10, the pizzas nearer £7, and the most expensive wine on the list is a mere £55(we don't try this one, sadly). 'It's mainly a younger crowd who come in the evenings,' he explains. 'Well, older people too, but because it's not right on Regent Street we don't get all the tourists. I haven't done a lot of publicity, we wanted it to be more word of mouth.' And do the fans press against the door for a glimpse of him? 'Not so much here. They come to Friends more because it's near the ground, and they come and talk - I don't mind, as long as they're polite. I'm pretty easy-going. And some of the Arsenal players came here once in a group. And my team mates come a lot. A lot of people just come off the street and like the look because it's cosy. That's what we hoped for, anyway.' No A-list celebs yet, then? He frowns, as if considering. 'Momento - Fabrizio!' The pizza chef lopes over, wiping his hands on his apron. There follows a lengthy dialogue, from which my crude grasp of Italian via Spanish allows me to extract the words 'television' and 'black'. Finally Di Matteo turns back triumphantly. 'Yes - he says that guy from Big Brother was in here the other day, the black guy.' Then he looks disappointed. 'I didn't see him, though.' So does this Renaissance man ever take a turn in the kitchen himself? 'Here? Oh, no.' He laughs. 'But I do love to cook. When I have a dinner party I like to invite loads of people, then I would just do like a salad buffet, with some snacks and cold meat and lots of different salads. But if it's for maybe six or eight people, I cook pasta. I like to do tagliatelle with salmon and vodka. Not too much vodka, just a little bit. It's a creamy sauce - I learnt it from my parents. They live in Italy now so when I go to visit they love to cook for me. Maybe my favourite traditional Italian dish is one they always cooked for me when I was a kid - Bocatini alla Matriciana. It's a Roman dish - bocatini is a kind of pasta like spaghetti only it's tubed and a bit wider. It's made with bacon and tomato, but it's important to add the right amount of chilli to spice it up to the right point. But you don't want to eat it if you're wearing a white shirt - it's very messy.' Precisely why you should never eat Italian food on a first date, QED. Did the rugged, pint-swilling English players ever deride his culinary hobbies as unmanly when he first arrived? He produces an elaborate Latin shrug. 'I didn't really care what other people thought. I just did what I wanted to do, and if some people don't like it - that's life.' We move on to the liqueurs; at least I do, hesitating momentarily over the grappa (we have a painful history) before opting for a safer limoncello. After a season marred by injury, is Di Matteo, at 30, looking towards his nascent restaurant empire as a future career? 'I don't know. Why not? I enjoy it very much. I think I have been lucky - London is a very good place to try a venture like this, because it's so multi-cultural. I certainly would not have tried something like this in Rome, people there are more closed-minded. And if I moved to another team in another country, I don't think I would try again. Maybe it could work in Spain, I don't know. But I'm very happy here for the moment.' The restaurant is beginning to fill up; regulars pause to chat to him, and a group of young women arrive looking for a table. I hint that he must get a lot of groupies keen to sample his lamb fillets. He pretends shock, then bashfully lowers his big, milk-chocolate eyes. 'Oh no! I'm not like that. I am not David Beckham,' he adds, with a knowing grin.","Id":"lifeandstyle/2001/may/13/foodanddrink.features7","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webTitle":"OFM eating with...

Decades of resistance by family-owned bars, pizzerias and restaurants look like ending in defeat with the announcement that the two chains are about to transform Italy's high streets by doubling their number of outlets. A massive investment is under way based on evidence that Italians are ready to abandon traditional eating habits once considered immutable. Gourmets yesterday bewailed the \"triumph of the hamburger\" and drew up plans for a counter-attack. US-owned McDonald's and British-owned Burger King - for years ghettoised at 5% of the market - are determined to bring Italy up to the European average of 25%. Within two years, McDonald's intends to open 200 restaurants, most of them in the centre and south of the country, which were considered heartlands of the Mediterranean diet. Its rival, which until last year did not have a single franchise, plans to open more than 100. The two companies expect to expand not at the expense of each other, but of traditional restaurants. According to McDonald's, turnover at its existing 243 restaurants jumped by almost a fifth last year. That is just scratching the surface, said Felice Invernizzi, marketing director of McDonald's Italia. Two months ago the chain launched its first pizza in Italy, called Pizza Mia. Sold by the slice, it has been a hit, despite purists' anguish. Burger King is bullish after cutting a deal with the pizza chain Spizzico, which can tap into a network of restaurants owned by its parent company, Autogrill. \"It is the globalisation of the palate,\" mourned La Repubblica yesterday. It published graphics showing how long it took to serve a Big Mac (90 seconds) and eat it (10 minutes). Breakdowns of ingredients and calorie count (610) were accompanied by warnings from leading gourmets. Edoardo Raspelli was sent on a field trip to McDonald's and Burger King in Milan. Having seen the future, he declared that it did not work: \"It takes a big effort to imagine this food as healthy.\" The ambience was mechanical, the chips like cardboard and the bread poor, he said. \"I found it alienating and vulgar.\" Mr Raspelli appealed for diners to respect skill and effort in cooking. \"To eat is to give birth,\" he said. Laura Mantovano, an editor of the food magazine Gambero Rosso, urged traditional restaurants to keep their nerve and continue serving simple Mediterranean dishes based around pasta. \"That has taste, vitamins and protein. And you consume it in 20 minutes, faster if you want. But in Italy it is an effort to convince the restaurants to drive out fast food with what is already there.\" Encouragement came from a survey done for Salute Naturale, a health magazine, which found that 70% of Italians felt unable to do without their pasta. A third said they became nervous if deprived. Yet traditional bars, cafes and restaurants continue to disappear. A survey by the Permanent Observatory on young people and alcohol in Rome found that 42% of young Italians consume all their drink in British or Irish-style pubs. While consumption of wine has dropped, demand for beer and spirits has shot up. Rome's Cafe de Paris, one of the few great bars on the celebrated Via Veneto, which attracted Marcello Mastroianni, Rita Hayworth and Frank Sinatra, has been turned into a burger bar. The new managers were pilloried for adding the words \"The cafe of the Dolce Vita\" to its old sign.","Id":"world/2000/may/04/rorycarroll","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Italy sees pasta give way to present","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/may/04/rorycarroll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/may/04/rorycarroll","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":584,"webPublicationDate":"2000-05-04T00:11:20Z","id":"world/2000/may/04/rorycarroll","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"A month on the rails","body":"I had 30 days for 12 major cities, two fairytale castles, a medieval town and essential relaxation on a Greek island. I left England with an overflowing rucksack, Lonely Planet, bags of enthusiasm and an all-zone Inter-rail pass (£229) for Europe for one month. I returned with a severely depleted bank account, sunburn, sore feet, invitations to various improbable corners of the world, and memories that will take some beating. Anyone under 26 can get an Inter-rail pass. As can the over-26s - for £319. Both can be bought from Rail Europe (08705 848848, (raileurope.co.uk). The practicalities I flew to Vienna (£65, with Buzz, and two hours late), and went on to Bratislava, Prague. Then Munich, Salzburg, the Czech border town of Cesky Krumlov, and Prague again. Then Frankfurt (one rainy morning), Paris, Venice, Rome, Naples, Athens (via the Brindisi-Patras ferry), the nearby island of Andros and back to London with EasyJet (£80, booked well in advance). My budget didn't stretch to much in the way of luxury. I slept in hostels or cheap hotels, on apartment floors, on trains, on ferries and in Athens airport. The liveliest hostel was YoHo in Salzburg; the cheapest (and nicest) was the Travellers Hostel in Cesky. Four of us shared a long, low, stone-floored chamber in a 14th-century building for the princely sum of £4 apiece. Venice, Rome and Greece were most expensive. An Athenian friend assured me that £25 each for a double on Andros was a very good price. Besides, it was worth incurring the extra overdraft for the ocean view, and a spot of night-time swimming. Food was cheapest from supermarkets and hostels (the shared kitchen is always pivotal to traveller sociability). But it would be a mistake never to venture out: outdoor cafes are, after all, the ideal lazy way to admire a city. Again, I paid more in Italy, and drinks (wine excepted) were at London prices in both Italy and Greece. Brezlgölb near Herrengasse in Vienna, was hard to track down but worth the effort, with authentic Austrian fare, wooden tables and gothic lanterns warming dark corners of what might once have been a castle cellar or crypt. All for £7.50 apiece. U Dwori Maryu, nestled on the riverside in Cesky, cost next to nothing and served such medieval fare as soup with daisies. The rather pricier Alla Rivetta, almost squashed under Ponte San Provolo and described by a friend of a friend as the only place to eat out in Venice, provided ambrosial seafood and a window on to the canal. Then there were picnics - in trains, in parks, and by moonlight on the deck of a Mediterranean ferry. It may not make the tour guides, but you don't get much better than ciabatta, fresh cheese, basil, tomatoes, grapes and cherries from the Rialto market, eaten in streaming sunshine in Venice's Campo di San Marco. The problems The trains had their moments. Travelling from Prague to Bratislava was like being in a 70s communist movie, with those six-person compartments, terrifying guards and yellow-brown decor. They didn't go everywhere, and rarely without slow and complicated changes. A couple of days with fellow travellers in a hire car took me to Neuschwanstein in Germany (whose castle inspired a scale model in Disneyland), as well as Cesky. Both are very much worth seeing; both difficult to reach by public transport. I wasted too much time queueing in stations. It took two hours in Rome's Termini station to get tickets to Naples. I also forked out for supplements on most intercity trains in Western Europe. Only six of my trains ran on time and some were spectacularly late. From Venice to Florence, we clocked up an impressive two-and-a-half-hour delay. Most annoyingly, something went wrong with the Prague-Frankfurt train at five in the morning: we were all shunted out of our carriage - first to stand jammed like sardines in the next one, then to wait on the cold platform until a replacement was found. The overnight ferry was fun - once you were on it. Lonely Planet swore you had to book weeks in advance, but Hellenic Mediterranean Lines claimed it was impossible to book over the phone. Getting from check-in to the ferry without a car involved a long, hot, anxious wait with about 50 other backpackers for a minibus. When it finally rolled up, all traveller solidarity was forgotten in the fight to get on board. The compensations It was definitely worth the effort. I made friends in one place, and then travelled with them for a week, or passed evenings in lively debate with people I had just met and would never see again. I stayed in an artist's garret overlooking Sacre Coeur with the friend of an American I met in Munich, and played cards for tequila shots with the Australian bartenders of a Parisian pub. I met a trainee chef who planned to open a restaurant in his native Chicago. And a London law graduate determined to follow his parents into shipping, with a North Carolina girlfriend who could have been the fourth member of Destiny's Child. An elderly Chinese couple were staying in a hostel in Venice, painstakingly cooking their own elaborate meals and speaking barely a word of Italian or English. A Swedish girl in Prague had chucked in her latest job and was hanging on until the money ran out - or she thought up a bestselling novel. Then there were the places. I am left with a mismatch of memories, all of which seem slightly unreal reviewed from the gloom of south London. A small boy playing Mozart, and very well, too, on a Viennese sidestreet; painters, dancers and singers creating an agreeable cacophony on Prague's Charles Bridge; La donna è mobile, from Verdi's Rigoletto, played, whistled or sung just about everywhere in Venice. But some stand out. Pompei was fascinating, and worth the trip to a too hot Naples, with its less than beautiful architecture and lethal drivers. Central Athens is similarly uninspired, but the Acropolis is a must-see, even in blistering heat. We ate in Plaka afterwards, a feast worthy of Athena herself, and admired it from a safe distance. The grounds of Vienna's Summer Palace were the stuff of fairytales, even in a rainstorm. And I spent hours in Prague's Old Town Square, sitting, standing, drinking or just attempting (in vain) to take it all in. Hofbrauhaus, Munich's infamous beer garden, was an astonishing, noisy, cheerful mass of people of all ages and nationalities, swigging from vast tankards at hundreds of wooden tables. It was worth the (not insignificant) price of the beer just to soak up the atmosphere. In Cesky, I sat on a castle wall with four near-strangers, now friends, and watched the sun set over a town seemingly untouched by time. It has to be one of those essential moments that travellers go on about, and that no one else understands. The Snake Bar lived up to its name, too. Happily, (for us rather than the snakes), they were confined to a tank kept under the counter. Kutna Hora, also in the Czech Republic, was weirdest of all: a church decorated with human bones. Bones in pyramids, in shields, even in a chandelier. But strangest by far were the skulls and crossbones hanging in loops from the ceiling, like paperchains at Christmas. Venice, of course, was spellbinding. Yes, it's a tourist trap, but with good reason. And the crowds seldom venture far from San Marco. It's pricey, but worth it. I sat with a friend in a quiet side street, feet not quite touching the murky canal waters, and watched the gondolas drift by with their loads of Japanese tourists and middle-aged Italian opera singers. It was cheaper than hiring one, and probably more entertaining. Rome, already an addictive city, was magical by night, as each new moment of almost cliched beauty capped the last. Birds (or were they bats?) lifting in clouds over the Vittoriano monument and a sickle moon in the night sky. Then eating pizza in Trastevere. Climbing the Spanish Steps. Sipping cocktails in Piazza Navona, and watching the world go by. Throwing a coin into the Trevi fountain and making a wish - although I suspect it would take more than L200 (about 6p) to get me Jude Law. Ten tips • Do some research before stumping up for an Inter-rail pass - supplements are pricey in Italy, and trains in Eastern Europe are very cheap anyway. • Save queueing at stations by checking train times on the internet or investing in a Thomas Cook timetable. • Take a Cirrus/Maestro cash card. Many hostels don't take credit cards; commission on traveller's cheques adds up, unless you seek out the relevant American Express shop. • Book in advance in Italy and Greece. • Take insect repellent. • Invest in proper city maps. The ones in the guidebooks are not adequate. • Organise your E111 and take out travel insurance. • Learn a few words of the language just to show willing. 'Thank you' and 'How much does it cost?' come in handy. • Be prepared for bad weather.

Rome was the perfect destination: cheap tickets were available online, the city would provide a suitably epic backdrop for a big occasion and surprisingly, neither of us had ever visited it before. By the time you get to 40, you pride yourself on having acquired a certain degree of competence. You know how to get results. But minutes after arriving in Rome, it feels as though all those painfully-acquired life skills are starting to slip away. First there's the white-knuckle taxi ride from the airport, which has us scrabbling like infants for our rear seat-belts (they prove to be for show purposes only), then helplessly handing over bundles of lire when the requested price proves to be double the sum on the meter. Walking turns out to be no less of a problem. Emerging from our hotel - the super-chic new Hotel de Russie, just off the Piazza del Popolo (9 Via del Babuino, tel: 39 06 32 88 81, single rooms from L590,000, doubles from L800,000) - we find ourselves among the promenading hordes. Of course, we've heard about la passeggiata; we just didn't know that in Rome it goes on all day. And a warm Sunday afternoon in autumn gives locals an ideal opportunity to show off their world-beating array of shiny leather suits and snakeskin hipsters. Whether the stiffness of the leather restricts movement, or new outfits have to be run in at low speed, like a new car engine, the shopping streets are virtually impassable, and what looks on the map like a short stroll turns into a Versace-clad obstacle course. Our next challenge arises when we decide to get some lunch. We want our first Italian meal in Rome to be perfect, and having wandered around the area, we're reassured to see a large number of promising-looking trattorias with pavement tables. But at 2pm, it's as though a lunch bell has sounded, and suddenly every restaurant has a queue outside, right down to the humblest pizza chain. We beat a retreat to a cavernous pizzeria. Forty minutes later, we're still waiting to be brought so much as a piece of bread. When our pizzas do eventually arrive, though, they're worth the wait - yeasty and crisp-based in the Roman style. Happily, this first dining experience turns out not to be typical. Despite their reputation, Romans aren't unfriendly to tourists. We just don't seem to register with them. Which is great, if you hate being hassled by people trying to sell you things. The centurions posing for photos outside the Colosseum are as near as Rome comes to pandering to the tourist trade. After our lunch experience, we are even more determined to find the perfect, mythical trattoria. Our pre-dinner stroll takes in the huge monument to King Vittorio Emanuele II, inaugurated in 1911 to celebrate the unification of the nation but often dismissively referred to as \"the wedding cake\". Then on to the Spanish Steps, where the mating call of hundreds of suburban adolescents rises on the evening breeze. Next, the Trevi fountain, immortalised in La Dolce Vita. We are overwhelmed by the size and swagger of the rococo marble confection, with its underwater carpet of glinting coins. I'm only left standing alone for a moment, gazing into the fountain's depths, when a soulful young man sidles up to me, and asks whether I speak Italian. Had I indeed been able to speak Italian, I could have snapped \"What are you playing at? I'm going to be 40 tomorrow!\" As it is, I flash him my biggest Anita Ekberg smile while backing away. Oh well, when in Rome... Around the corner from the Parliament building, we stumble across what looks like our ideal, untouristy little trattoria. At first, it seems perfect. It obviously hasn't been decorated since Mussolini's day, and its handful of tables are filled with laughing groups of students and other bohemian types. There's no written menu - a shy waitress recites the evening's choices - three pastas and two meat dishes. It's only after we've ordered that we notice the state of the kitchen and, even more alarming, the state of its only occupant, a mountainous, be-slippered female straight from the kitchen of Castle Gormenghast. Perfectly good though our spinach and ricotta ravioli turns out to be, this place falls just on the wrong side of authentic. We resolve to do some research and book somewhere really good for tomorrow night's birthday dinner. How can we go wrong with Il Convivio (31,Vicolo dei Soldati, tel:06 686 9432)? It's listed in the \"splashing out\" section of our guidebook as \"a temple of foodie excellence\". And temple is just about right. From its forbidding wooden door and whispering waiters, to the reverential near-silence of its clientele, this is a place of worship rather than enjoyment. The food is predictably fantastic, in the teased-up, whittled-down style peculiar to Michelin-starred restaurants. But the best dish is the simplest: a heap of fresh, buttery tagliatelle, over which our waiter grates white truffle until I tell him to stop - rather a hair-raising judgment call, as I've been given a menu with no prices on it. In the end, our meal comes to around £100, which is less than we'd feared. On the last full day of our Roman holiday, we abandon any pretence of sightseeing, and concentrate on finding our dream restaurant. The breakthrough comes with our discovery of the Bar Notegen (159 Via del Babuino tel: 06 320 0855). Seemingly unchanged since the 1950s, it's a snug, wood-panelled room lined with old black-and-white photos of Italian actors and artists. This feels very much like Fellini country - the director lived nearby - and some of the characters who hang around the Notegen still seem to be auditioning for a part in one of his movies. That evening, just around the corner from the Notegen - and our hotel - we finally find our perfect vision of a Roman trattoria. The Edy (4 Vicolo del Babuino, tel: 06 36 00 17 38) has everything - a glowing, candle-lit interior, warm and welcoming staff, a chef who pops out from the kitchen to see how his dishes are going down, cooed-over infants in high chairs munching on breadsticks. And most importantly, really great cooking. Seafood spaghetti is baked in a foil parcel, which is brought to the table to spill its aromatic contents. Bean and pasta soup is thick enough to stand a spoon in. Grilled lamb cutlets bring out the Ancient Roman in me, and I'm soon attacking them with both hands. No doubt there are hundreds of restaurants in Rome as unpretentious, friendly and atmospheric as the Edy. But we didn't have the time to find them all. However, during our brief stay we managed to take in a fair number of Rome's most famous sights. Inevitably, though, things got left off the list. We didn't make it to the Sistine Chapel, or inside Saint Peter's. Instead, we opted to avoid the crowds of pilgrims by walking around the Vatican City late at night. This turned out to be a good move - we found ourselves alone in the square in front of the magnificently-spotlit cathedral as its bells tolled midnight, the only spectators at a spooky son et lumière.

Gabriele Gravina kicked-off his smothering-efforts in 1998 by filing criminal charges against author Joe McGinniss before the book was even finished. The magistrate, a former business associate of Gravina's, passed charges of fraud, defamation and issuance of threat - a potential 12-year prison sentence - on to the Ministry of Justice in Rome. 'McGinniss likes Italy', Gravina told the press. 'Let's see how much he likes Italian justice.' The Ministry threw out the charges, but Gravina was content. 'I am not surprised,' he said. ' In any event, my only reason for bringing these charges was to block publication of his book in Italy, and in this I have succeeded.' Or not. After mainstream publishers Mondadori, Rizzoli and Garzanti were all apparently warned off - Garzanti's editor explaining 'I would rather be a live editor than a dead hero' - radical-left, anti-Pope, anti-Berlusconi trouble-loving publishing house Kaos Edizioni stepped in.

Munching a Big Mac with fries was the antithesis of receiving communion and should be spurned by Catholics, declared Avvenire. McDonald's, already bruised from clashes with employees, environmentalists, communists and gourmets, found itself accused of promoting selfishness. \"The excommunication of the hamburger,\" as the newspaper La Repubblica described it. In a full-page attack, Avvenire denounced eat-and-run habits for lacking the communitarian aspect of sharing: \"It is not Catholic. It completely forgets the holiness of food.\" The author, Massimo Salani, a lecturer at Pisa's centre for theological studies, said McDonald's was better suited to the Lutheran mentality of an individual relationship between man and God. Eating food in the fastest possible way, often alone, satisfied only the self, not others, he said. During Mass, Catholics approach the altar to take Eucharist at the same time. Monsignor Domenico Sigalini, of the CatholicBishops' Conference, endorsed the article but cautioned that fast food was not sinful. \"To reduce everything to zero, to eliminate conversation for the sake of speed, is to lose a sense of the family,\" he said. A survey for La Repubblica said the average Big Mac in Italy was served within 90 seconds and eaten within 10 minutes. McDonald's later issued a statement to reassure Catholics. \"Fast food does not mean eating quickly, but being served quickly. We serve sandwiches to cater to all religions and nationalities and we adapt to every culture in the world.\" Pasta salads and pizza slices have given the chain a local flavour. When the chain opened its first restaurant near the Spanish Steps in Rome in the mid-80s, gourmets predicted Italians would never succumb. They were wrong. Hugely popular with families and students, the chain now has 272 outlets and plans to almost double that number in the next two years, bringing Italy closer in line with France and Britain. Despite its imminent expansion the past few months have been rough for the restaurant group. Riot police were mobilised in October when thousands of demonstrators in 20 cities declared war on the fast-food chain. Chanting \"Better a day of tortellini than 100 days of hamburgers\", they vowed to emulate French resistance to the symbol of Americanisation. Where France has the anti-globalisation protester, farmer José Bové, Italy has Fausto Bertinotti, leader of the Refounded Communists. He told 100,000 protesters last month that he understood why people attacked the restaurants. The coalition of family-run bars, gourmets, trade unions and environmentalists was galvanised by a spate of walkouts by disgruntled McDonald's staff. Appealing for calm, the centre-left government has promised to draw up a charter of principles to guide the behaviour of multinationals.","Id":"world/2000/nov/10/catholicism.religion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Catholics order Big Mac to go","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/nov/10/catholicism.religion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/nov/10/catholicism.religion","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":464,"webPublicationDate":"2000-11-10T02:47:50Z","id":"world/2000/nov/10/catholicism.religion","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Police rescue British woman forced to work as a prostitute","body":"A British woman who was kidnapped by Albanian criminals while on holiday in Italy and forced to work as a prostitute for almost five weeks has been rescued by Italian police.

He is ignored. This is where Lazio's irriducibili gather, but it is the time for finding friends, choosing a spot, munching pizza, skinning up, flicking through damp fanzines and newspapers. Front page headlines wonder whether Roma can be prevented from winning the scudetto. Tucked inside are the other stories: a match stopped because of a riot in the stands; probes into players' fake passports; stars pleading innocence after testing positive for banned substances; referees accused of taking bribes... Twelve minutes to kick-off and it is down to business. Paolo, a chunky man in boots and black bomber jacket goes first, stomping to the front to cheers. Another follows and another until more than 200 stand in the downpour. Their chants are picked up by the rest of the curva. 'Parma vaffanculo' becomes a roar. Fists are raised. Marco's eyes gleam. The Parma contingent, a patch of maybe 300 visitors on the opposite Curva Sud, are forgotten as the irriducibili's rage widens. 'Tutto e tutti vaffanculo!' Everyone and everything is being invited to fuck itself. Red flares fizz overhead. Rain hardens and thunder rolls in theatrical timing as the players jog into the arena. A forest of right arms stretches upward in fascist salute. A giant screen flashes the players' names and faces. The Curva Nord inhales as one and erupts at the first black face. 'Booh-booh-booh-booh.' In staccato it sounds like thousands of monkeys. Parma are fielding four black players. A feast for the irriducibili. Racism, hatred, violence, corruption: welcome to Serie A, Italy's Premiership. Once upon a time this was where the beautiful game was at its most beautiful. Once upon a time this was, Italians prided themselves, the most glamorous league in the world - and the best. No longer. Today the face of Italian football is bruised, contorted and ugly. The league's reputation is in tatters - and for reasons far more fundamental and disturbing than the poor recent record of its clubs in European competition. A malaise has engulfed calcio this season. There have been ambushes, stabbings and beatings as violence has spilled from the stadiums into cities with ultras (the hard-core fans) turning Serie A, B and C into battlefields. There have been attacks on players by their own supporters, a trend that has included besieged dressing rooms, assaults on players' relatives and a firebomb attack on a team bus. There has been widespread evidence of corruption, from match-fixing and bribery, to positive dope tests and dodgy passports. Finally there has been the exposure to a disbelieving and disgusted international audience of an apparently endemic malicious racism among both fans and players that is all but tolerated in Italy itself. Last autumn the Arsenal midfielder Patrick Vieira and his black team-mates were subjected to sustained abuse during their Champions League game in Rome, and not just from Lazio's notoriously racist fans. The Yugoslav defender Sinisa Mihajlovic repeatedly called Vieira a nigger. Vieira spoke of a 'racist atmosphere that you can almost breathe' and in the aftermath Uefa were swift to punish Mihajlovic with a two-match ban while his club forced him to apologise publicly, a microphone in his hand, shortly before the kick-off of Lazio's next Champions League fixture, against Shakhtar Donetsk. Lazio's coach Dino Zoff was relaxed about the shoddy incident. Cursing during matches, he said, was unfortunate, but went on all the time. Last season, when the club had been fined after fans barracked Venezia's black defender Bruno N'Gotty, Zoff, the most capped player in Italian history and a former national team coach, had been even less concerned. 'I don't know whether you could really call that racism,' he said. 'It's more a question of people making fun. Fans pick on someone tall, short, grey-haired.' Zoff's response then was echoed in the ambivalent attitude across Italy to Mihajlovic's verbal assault on Vieira. And within minutes of hearing Mihajlovic's apology combined with an appeal for tolerance, Lazio's fans produced their own response. When Shakhtar's Nigerian centre-half Izek Okoronkwo got his first touch the grunting began again. (A few weeks later it was Emile Heskey's turn during an England-Italy friendly in Turin, an incident that prompted FA protests.) Italy's football officials say things are not so bad, that problems are exaggerated and temporary. A journey through Serie A suggests the opposite. The problems are that bad and getting worse. They are also connected. Racism, violence and corruption feed off each other. If mentioned at all, racism is usually buried far down the match report, a single sentence about a black player being barracked every time he touched the ball. As sure as the whistle blows every Sunday players will be vilified for the colour of their skin. On that night's football chat shows, marathons of analysis and opinion, there is rarely a mention. A stadium resounding to booh-booh-booh is not a shock, not a scandal, it is merely there. It carries with it an echo of English football 25 years ago, when black footballers could be greeted by monkey noises and bananas thrown from the terraces. But even then the abuse was not so vicious and the disease not so widespread - or so acceptable. Because in Italy today it's not just skinheads who are doing it. At January's Lazio-Inter match, Michael Fanizadeh, a coordinator of Football Against Racism in Europe, was shocked to see women and children hurling abuse. And those fans who do not join in sometimes grimace, sometimes smirk, but mostly look as if they don't hear anything. Maybe they don't. Maybe the taunting is so routine they no longer notice. Except no one believes that. It is impossible to be unaware of the ritual. From Udine to Verona, Brescia to Rome, Naples to Bari, it zig-zags down the peninsula, relaying an unmistakable message: racism is tolerated. The nation watches as abuse rains down on some of the league's greatest footballers - players such as Edgar Davids of Juventus, Lilian Thuram and Patrik Mboma of Parma, and Clarence Seedorf of Internazionale -and the nation does nothing about it. Prejudice bubbles openly. In January Verona, who have struggled all season, were linked with a move for the highly rated Mboma, the African Player of the Year. The deal fell through. 'You need to draw your own conclusions,' the Verona president, Giambattista Pastorello, said. 'If you have fans that do these things you need to have patience.' (The club later insisted that of course Pastorello did not mean to say racists could veto signings.) And it's not just fans. In February last year Torino's Senegalese defender Djibril Diawara had his nose smashed while playing Bari. With blood pouring from his face, Diawara confronted Luigi Garzya, Bari's captain. This was too much for Bari's coach, Eugenio Fascetti, who shouted: 'The nigger Diawara spat in Garzya's face! And the spit might even be infected! Why don't they just stay home, these niggers?' Fascetti later said he had missed his player's elbowing of Diawara and withdrew his statement. To heap salt onto the wound, Diawara received a four-match ban for spitting, while Garzya, a white Italian, received only a one-match ban for pushing him in the face. Not that racism is a particularly recent development in Italian football. The formation of the ultras dates back to the late Sixties. At the time they found their inspiration from England and adopted English habits such as scarves and chanting. But there was also one Italian habit. Politics. In tune with those rebellious times, the ultras reflected political rivalries: Lazio were of the Right, for instance, while their great rivals Roma were communists. In those early days they even displayed the same banners that had been used in political demonstrations, turning them over and putting football slogans on the back. These days, however, the relationship between politics and football has been turned on its head: political rallies no longer lead to riots, so football has become the most promising outlet for those itching for a fight. And, as the ultras have become more uniformly right-wing, there have been orchestrated attempts by the hard Right to infiltrate and use football to recruit members - though even that may simplify the phenomenon. Maurizio Marinelli, director of the Study Centre for Public Security, has identified three types of infiltration. The Right have targeted Lazio, Verona, Fiorentina and Inter, infusing a xenophobic, anti-Semitic agenda. Left-wing militants have targeted Livorno, Modena, Ternana and Genoa. They are less ideological but want to rebel. And finally there is an embryonic third category, a misanthropic movement called Loma which is trying to inject nihilistic individualism into Torino, Lazio, Genoa and Verona. In such ways have cities with relatively good race relations, such as Verona and Bari, acquired racist fans. Sometimes there is even a quasi-official tone to Italy's racism. During a 1997 trip to Poland, the Italian national squad refused to accompany federation officials on a visit to Auschwitz. A journalist who wrote the story was threatened. Meanwhile Gianluigi Buffon, the Italian national goalkeeper, has worn a T-shirt sporting the fascist slogan, 'Death to those who surrender'. Buffon, who plays for Parma in Serie A, also raised a few eyebrows last year when he picked 88 as his shirt number for the new season. The decision upset Italy's Jewish community, which pointed out that the figure is sometimes used as a neo-Nazi symbol - 'H' is the eighth letter of the alphabet, so 88 equates to HH, or Heil Hitler. Buffon denied any knowledge of the link, claiming: 'I have chosen 88 because it reminds me of four balls and in Italy we all know what it means to have balls: strength and determination.' He later changed his number to 77. When Dutch defender Aron Winter signed for Lazio in 1992, graffiti appeared welcoming the 'nigger Jew' to the club. The pea-brained authors clearly had not noticed that the player's middle name is Mohammed. And then there are the banners - Celtic crosses, swastikas, slogans. Some are 50m long - 'Auschwitz is your town, the ovens your houses' - or a more modest 40m - 'Honour to the Tiger Arkan'. Death camps, Serb war criminals, anything goes. When interviewed, which isn't often, black players admit to feeling isolated but tend to keep their heads down. There are very few black Italian players, though Fabio Liverani made history a couple of weeks ago by becoming the first black player to represent Italy when he made his international debut in a friendly match with South Africa. Matteo Ferrari, a black Italian who plays for Internazionale, would not identify an abusive opponent to La Repubblica. 'It was all finished after 90 minutes,' he said. 'The player in question asked for my forgiveness.' Clarence Seedorf, a team-mate of Ferrari, said his white team-mates rarely discuss the chanting. 'When these things happen I don't feel offended. I think with sadness of those people, of their education, which must be very low,' he said. In some respects he is right. Some fans are too ignorant or immature to distinguish between monkey noise and the abuse hurled at white players and rival fans. After all, bad taste is the leitmotif: burn the South, shit you are and shit you'll stay, cat eaters, earthquake victims, Juliet is a whore. Some positive steps have been taken. Roma and Lazio officials visited a synagogue and up and down the country players sported kit with anti-racist slogans on 22 October. Stiffer penalties have reduced the number of offensive banners. Ultras have appointed stewards. But, by any standards, the response is inadequate. Calcio's defenders usually argue that football merely reflects racism in society, which is where the cause and cure lie. They have a point. Racism has risen sharply since immigration sprinkled black and brown faces in what until 10 years ago had been an almost all-white population. Unemployment and crime are falling yet xenophobia spreads. Opinion polls show the arrivals are blamed for crime, disease and poaching jobs. Right-wing extremist groups have sprouted in many cities. On 13 May, the centre-right is expected to win a general election on a platform of cracking down on migration. The Northern League, part of the centre-right, now bashes illegal immigrants instead of southern Italians. Calcio inevitably absorbs these influences but some believe it performs a service by allowing racists to ventilate. 'Perhaps it is better to let them shout themselves out in stadiums than to prohibit them and find them cropping up again, ominously, in city streets,' said Giuliano Zincone, a Corrierre della Sera columnist. Enzo Bianco, the Interior Minister, thinks stadiums legitimise racism. Whether as a consequence non-white immigrants are more or less likely to be beaten up is impossible to say. But the galvanising effect on the extreme Right is undeniable. Fabrizio, an irriducibili leader, said the stadium had become the only place to express right-wing views. Groups like MS-Fiamma Tricolore and Forza Nuova rely on matches for publicity and recruitment. 'The stadium is an aspect of the social fabric where we conduct our politics,' says Roberto Fiore, the London-based head of Forza Nuova. Paolo, the chunky skinhead who pushed to the front of the irriducibili, was a member. Marco, the trainee accountant, was not. He joined in the salute for the hell of it. Paolo's job is to nurture Marco. Yet no politician, club or player has emerged to consistently champion anti-racism. The typical response is silence. As a result no country in Europe comes close to the frequency, viciousness and openness of the racism to be found in Italy's football. Unlike Dino Zoff, the issue clearly upsets Arrigo Sacchi, one of Zoff's predecessors as national coach. 'We have the least habitable, the most uncivilised and poorly educated stadiums in the world,' Sacchi said. 'The sporting culture here is broadly deficient.'

The Prime Minister's admiration for Romano Prodi fits with a wider appreciation of things Italian. This summer, as last summer and the summer before, the Blairs will take their family holiday in Tuscany. In choosing Chiantishire as his August retreat, he is not unusual among Europe's progressive élite. He is uncommonly lyrical on the subject of Italy, praising its 'marvellous climate, food, wine and landscape', the 'hospitality of the people' and its 'totally relaxing atmosphere'. Sierra Man is important to New Labour, but there is a special place in Blair's heart for Siena Man. But the Italian connection is a deeper matter than that. He was helped to the leadership of his party and thus to the premiership by a bargain struck in an Italian restaurant. It was at Granita in Islington that he negotiated Gordon Brown out of the contest. One of the most enduring caricatures of the New Labour élite portrays them living off a diet of sun-dried tomatos, rocket salad and roast peppers, washed down with extra-virgin olive oil. Like all caricatures, it contains a pine kernel of truth. The Blairs, in common with many middle-class Britons, have developed a passion for good Italian food. The River Café, the west London restaurant where Tuscan peasant cooking is served at princely prices, has long been a favourite of the First Couple. Despite this, the Prime Minister has not always been simpatico to Italian sensibilities. The British presidency of Europe was marked by a tie designed to symbolise the Union. The Italians were represented by a slice of pizza, which they found so insulting they made a formal protest. And the Italians should be warned that the chameleon-like Mr Blair can be multi-national in his favours. There was a phase - in which he made speeches about turning Britain into a 'Young Country' - when Blair seemed to want to associate with Australia. He was keen to learn from America - at least until Bill Clinton caught his pecker in his zipper. He can play at being French, delighting the National Assembly with a speech drawing on his experiences as a waiter in a Paris café. If it suited his purposes, you can be sure the Prime Minister would manage to develop an affinity with Germany, Finland or Luxembourg. That said, the passion for Italy is genuine. In some respects it seems surprising. The tendency to chaos of Italian politics does not fit with New Labour's world of spin-doctoring and control. Indeed, Prodi has privately cautioned Blair to look at Italy before he embraces proportional representation. Religion could be part of the appeal, especially if there is any truth to the rumour that the Prime Minister has toyed with crossing the floor to Rome. There is no other country in which to better appreciate the glories of Catholicism. Politics might be part of it. Signor Prodi did himself no harm in Blairite eyes by being an early enthusiast for New Labourism. La Stampa remarked last week that the former Italian premier had the virtue of being 'neither of the Right nor of the Left'. Arguably, the whole idea of Blairism was originally Italian. Gramsci, the intellectual founder of historic compromise by the Left, could lay a claim to be the inventor of the Third Way down which Blair is embarked. He argued - in words which could define New Labour - that the war of position should be abandoned for the war of maneouvre. Myself, I think the reason for Tony Blair's love of Italy is rather more simple and rustic. He likes the place, the climate, the food, the wine and the people.","Id":"politics/1999/mar/21/uk.politicalnews1","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Blair waves an olive branch for Italy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/mar/21/uk.politicalnews1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/mar/21/uk.politicalnews1","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":628,"webPublicationDate":"1999-03-21T03:38:24Z","id":"politics/1999/mar/21/uk.politicalnews1","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Italians react with horror to idea of eating GM foods","body":"Pepi Maurilio has been running the snack bar round the corner from the Rome opera house for the past 20 years.

But probably the most important thing to know about Mantua is that the people there do eat some quite interesting things. Frog-leg pasta. Rabbit ragu. Marinated raw eel. Not much spaghetti. On our second night in this gloriously beautiful and unforgettably charming place, we went to a restaurant where nobody spoke any English at all. I should point out that the only Italian I speak myself is the sentence \" ha scritto una romanza, andiamo \", which means \"I have written a novel, let's go\", which an Italian publisher once told me were the only words a young single man would need in his country if he wanted to have a memorable visit. Anyway, there we were, myself and the missus, in this unpretentious local eatery, ordering dishes just because we liked the sound of them when spoken mezzo forte by the friendly waiters. This, we felt, was a brave thing to do in a city where one of the local specialties is donkey stew. Yes, spezzatino de Mantua , while it sounds very wonderful, is made from the flesh of a genuine donkey. And while it isn't actually served with the two ears protruding TV-aerial-style from the sauce, it is nevertheless, one suspects, something of an acquired taste. Dearly as I love the Guardian and its readers, I have to admit I didn't try to acquire it. Investigative journalism is all very well, but presumably even Pilger would draw the line somewhere. Apart from mule casserole, Mantua is something of a foodie's paradise. Asking for a deep-pan pizza here, or a plate of spag bol like Mama used to make, is a way of not making any friends. The city is in south-eastern Lombardy, but close enough to the regions of Veneto, Trentino and Emilia-Romagna to have adopted their traditional dishes as their own. Indeed, Mantua is a place that happily regards the cuisine of the rest of Italy as more or less up for grabs. You name it, you can find it to eat here in Mantua, cooked to perfection and at a third of the price you'd pay for it in London, in one of those trendy restaurants that feels like a boutique where the waitresses introduce themselves before taking your order. Though, be advised, it's a very good thing to like pumpkin if you're coming here, because tortelli di zucca (ravioli stuffed with pulped pumpkin and almond) is so ubiquitous that it's sold on the street corner the way dodgy watches and fake designer jeans are in England. So awesomely popular is this humble globose fruit that the city recently held a three-day festival of celebration at its most important cultural centre entitled, \" La citta delle zuche \", featuring art shows, documentaries and installations about pumpkins. I swear to God I am not making this up. Eating here is organised a bit like a boxing match. Full of fight, you spring from your corner and gamely attack the antipasto , which in other parts of Italy is small enough to be served in a saucer, but in Mantua is often so big that it practically comes in an upturned dustbin lid. Next round is the primo piatti , your starter, basically, a mound of melt-in-the-mouth risotto the size of a soccer ball or a hunk of prosciutto from a pig so athletically proportioned that you really wouldn't want to meet it down a dark alleyway. Weak with satiation, you retire from the fray, silently wishing you could just leave now. But you can't, the tender pummelling of the taste buds is about to continue. In comes the seconds, enough for a Borgia or at least a minor Pavarotti on a bit of a diet. You dodge, you weave, but you're up against the ropes. Then come the vegetables, then dessert, then cheese, then coffee and a liqueur, very possibly a grappa, a particularly muscular local brand of hooch made from the grape skins left over from wine-making. Reluctance to follow this historically-ordained pattern is met by raisings of eyebrows from waiters, or, even worse, understanding and tolerant smiles that say, \"Ah, these poor northern Europeans, with their meagre appetites both sexual and culinary.\" It is a wonder to me how so many Italians are thin, graceful and phenomenally attractive. After one long weekend spent in Mantua, I would have been afraid to strip off and sunbathe on a beach, lest I be struck on the head with a bottle of champagne and officially launched by Romano Prodi. After all this gorging, you will need a good walk. And by day or by night, Mantua is a blissful pleasure to ramble around, its narrow cobbled streets abounding with dusty antique shops, little cafés and, or course, delicatessens practically singing with agreeable aromas. The thing about the great Italian cities most beloved by tourists is that there's just so much of them. On and on they go, with their piazzas and duomos, their Vias and Museos, their hot streets named after recently-discredited communist leaders in the pay of the Mafia or significant dates from long-forgotten wars. Wandering around Venice, for example, can feel oddly like being force-fed on very nice chocolates. Startlingly magnificent as they undoubtedly are, your Florences and Romes can wear you out - an important ruin here, a Renaissance masterpiece there, spit on the street and you hit a Leonardo. But Mantua is a town built small and neat, a modest, commodious little place, nestling around four squares and tucked into a space between two lakes, named, with a minimalist approach to adjectival language quite startlingly un-Italian, Lago Superiore and Lago Inferiore. Even here, you are never far from culinary concerns - the pleasant grassy banks abound with fishermen, seeking the bass, pike, perch and zander with which the waters are happily teeming. Here, you may stroll on a Sunday afternoon, eat ice cream, watch Italian families being somehow both traditional and cool at the same time, and generally feel like an extra in a Fellini movie. Yes, all the traditional Italian activities may be enjoyed in the lakeside parks. Drinking wine. Discussing Dante. Riding your Vespa. Forming a new coalition government. Back in town, the most important building is the Palazzo Ducale, which was built by the local ruling dynasty, the Gonzagas, in the days when modest understatement wasn't really the thing. Begun in the 13th century and never truly completed, with 500 rooms, a floor space of 40,000 square metres and a total population of almost 1,000, it was, at one time, the largest palace in Europe, a gaff so utterly over the top that you could quite easily imagine the Duchess of York living there now. Only a small portion of this town within a city is open to the public - its restoration, like its original construction, is a never-ending story. Indeed, to see it all would take several days. But rooms that fall into the must-see category include the Sala delle Sinopie, where important sketches by Pisanello have recently been discovered beneath the frescoes, and the tapestry apartment, boasting magnificent work by Raphael. Elsewhere, the palace features an entire scaled-down model of the St John Lateran cathedral in Rome, something no tasteful home should be without. This miniature oddity is sometimes described by the locals as \"the midgets' room\", because way back in the days of yore one of the more crazy elderly female Gonzagas used to collect male dwarves as a hobby. (The guidebooks all say that they used to entertain her, though specifically how is thankfully not outlined.) A pleasant 20-minute stroll out of town, past the home of the greatest locally-born artist Andrea Mantegna, is the rather more humble and manageable Palazzo Te. Designed by Giulo Romano for Duke Federico Gonzaga and his main floozie, with a moat surrounding it to keep the duchess away, this is a place you can see in an hour. Duke Federico seems to have been 16th-century Mantua's equivalent to Austin Powers and this, verily, was his shagpad, baby. The first thing you see when you enter is a panel of paintings celebrating the life of King David. Biblical scholars among you will recall that King David murdered his lover Bathesheba's husband, so he could have his wicked way without having to suffer the inconvenience of spousal objections. This particular mural was commissioned very shortly after the duke's girlfriend's husband was mysteriously done in and thrown into Lago Inferiore in several untidy pieces. You can't help wondering if other Mantuan husbands were being subtly told something here. The interior is spectacular, featuring room after room of erotic frescoes, which would lead one quite quickly to the view that Italians in the olden days did quite a bit more than paint madonnas and invent submarines. This is a family newspaper, so full description will have to be avoided. Suffice it to say that I have not seen so many bare bottoms and assorted dangly bits since my undergraduate days at Peterhouse College, Cambridge. T he most fun room in the palace depicts the mythical battle between the giants and the Greek gods, which was won by the gods in a penalty shoot-out. This is a kind of Renaissance Marvel cartoon strip, the vast mural spreading from the walls all over the ceiling, the whole scary effect considerably augmented by the fact that the duke had an expert on acoustics design the room with a tremendous echo (before, no doubt, bonking his wife and murdering him). If you dropped a button on the floor in here, the resulting boom would be heard five chambers away. It is said that Federico and his moll were particularly fond of doing it in the giants' room. It must have made quite a commotion. But when they weren't getting jiggy, the early Italians were saying their prayers. And if there's one thing Italian Catholicism loves, it's a relic. This a country where bits of saints are stored in crypts like chops in a freezer. Mantua can rightly claim a certain smug superiority in this regard because when it comes to relics, it has trumped everyone else. Not for this place the fingernail clippings of Saint Theresa or the left buttock of John the Baptist. No, no, here they have the blood of Christ! Which in Catholic relic terms is very much the big enchilada. The blood was reportedly brought from the holy land by the soldier who pierced Jesus's side on the cross, which was nice of him, I suppose, though it can't have made the donor feel much better. But, sadly, I have to report that you can't actually see Our Lord's solidified blood itself, at least, not without making an appointment with the sacristan. It is kept deep in the bowels of the rather stern Basilica di Sant Andrea, where, miraculously, a bit like the Italian lire, it goes into meltdown three times a year. All in all, then, Mantua is marvellous. A two- to three-hour flight from anywhere in Britain, and a pleasant 40-minute drive from Verona airport, it's a place that's just about ideal for a long weekend of peace or a short romantic jaunt. Just, please, do remember one vital thing. In Ireland, people sometimes say that a person is so hungry he would eat somebody's ass. Only in Mantua is that literally true. The practicals British Airways (0345 222111) and Al Italia (0171-602 7111) fly several times daily from London Gatwick and Heathrow to Mantua's nearest airport, Verona.

George Eliot thought 40 was the minimum age. But the fact is, old people do not have the monopoly on 'reality', and you have to capitalise on what little experience you have - I've never been much good at anything else, apart from smoking and Polo, and almost everyone I know has had to sell their ponies. One of the characters in my latest novel is a model named Marina, and even though she is considerably more successful than I ever was in that line of work, I have a modest reservoir of experience to draw on. My own brief modelling career began soon after I made a friend named Lisa at Oxford and we took to spending a lot of time semi-conscious in cocktail dresses. It seemed as though they were taking for ever to give us a degree, and when we found ourselves flat out in the quad at my college one morning I began to wonder if the boredom wasn't going to kill me. I remember the voice of my tutorial partner somewhere behind me saying 'I see we won't be discussing post-modernism today.' Then, I suppose, she stamped off to starch something and an obliging Classics scholar carried me up to my rooms. I decided then that there must be an occupation that was less soul-destroying than literary criticism. Shortly afterwards, I ran away to Italy, fell in love with a painter and got pneumonia, which comes with the most fantastic cheekbones. At the time it seemed a good idea to put them to work. Florence is no fashion Mecca, but since I scrape five feet ten and have teeth that might charitably be described as wonky, it was as close to Milan as I was likely to get. One of my first shoots found me slumped beside a coordinating blonde (models get matched exactly like curtains and wallpaper) in the back of a Mercedes, heading towards a nightclub on the outskirts of Florence. The blonde had been flown in and no one could work out what language she spoke, so we just left her chewing a celery stick. Everyone was terribly worried about a chap called Boris. I have no idea who he was because at that time my Italian was terrible. However, one makes an unspoken oath in the fashion industry - an oath upon which rests the fundamental salaries of the big designers - to pretend that dresses matter, that everyone's very busy and that it's all very urgent indeed. So I worried about Boris too. Eventually we found him outside the nightclub. He told me he was in a boy band and when we got into the club he put his demo on the sound system and did a lot of pelvic thrusts until the photographer made him sit quietly and have his make-up done. The job was 90 per cent shivering in your knickers while people wondered what your shape would do less damage to: the A-line mini or the boot-leg trousers? I had thought that having a few classical male proportions around might liven the experience up. But with Boris draped around my neck I felt like one of those Australian shearers, lugging a lame sheep for miles and enduring its bleating in my ear. The end came barely six months into my inglorious career. After all the hard work the pneumonia had done I was apprehended with a mouthful of pizza on via Serragli. My booker, Beba, promptly summoned me to be measured for a show in Rome. Thankfully none of the assembled brunettes was thin enough, so we stood united, with our joyless bottoms and resentful thighs, as Beba recited the Seven Deadly Sins: 'Cioccolato, pizza . . .' I refer to what feminist conscience I have as 'the indignant grandmothers', who snort and stamp when I think seriously about mascara. It was they who prompted me to raise my hand and say: 'I was actually thinking of putting on a little weight so I could maybe think about something other than moisturiser.' To judge from the expression on Beba's face, I might as well have pulled out a gun. My character Marina shares the loathing I acquired at this time for feminine fictions like 'My skin? Oh, just soap and water' or 'What, this old thing?' Or, worst of all, 'I just eat and eat and I can't gain weight.' Lies, damned lies. Of course models starve themselves - most of them couldn't even lift a novel, let alone write one, which is why I had to stop. I remember that era, without the least bit of tender nostalgia, as my salad days.","Id":"theguardian/1999/feb/03/features11.g27","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"The Lit Girl","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/feb/03/features11.g27","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/feb/03/features11.g27","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts","wordcount":806,"webPublicationDate":"1999-02-03T02:03:27Z","id":"theguardian/1999/feb/03/features11.g27","hosted":false}]
