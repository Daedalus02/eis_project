Roma were drawing 0-0 with Sassuolo but just for a moment that was not his priority, as he went to retrieve a team shirt to give to a young supporter in a wheelchair he had noticed beside the pitch. This gesture could not surprise anyone who has followed Mourinho in his career. This is the man who gave a Manchester United supporter the jacket off his own back, and who had Inter staff send him the first person in the queue for Champions League final tickets so he could give them two free of charge. Such generosity with individuals has always been part of his nature. And so has a habit for singling out scapegoats when things go wrong. Related: Bayer Leverkusen’s revival under Xabi Alonso continues with derby delight | Andy Brassell By full-time, we had progressed to the latter. The game ended 1-1, Tammy Abraham putting Roma ahead in the 80th minute before Andrea Pinamonti equalised in the 84th. Despite briefly leading, Mourinho’s team deserved no more than a draw, showing commitment in the tackle but little inspiration on the ball. The better chances fell to their hosts. More compelling than the game itself was the post-game press conference that followed. “Our efforts were betrayed by a player with an unprofessional attitude,” said Mourinho. “Mistakes are part of the game; footballers know they can mess up. But I don’t like unprofessional attitudes. I had 16 players on the pitch: I liked the attitude of 15. The other one, not so much.” He declined to name names but said he had done so in the changing room, inviting the target of his ire to find a new club. “You have never seen me be critical of Rui Patricio who made a mistake here last year or [Lorenzo] Pellegrini who missed a penalty against Juve. You have never seen me be critical of any player. I make mistakes too and as a family we need to support each other. “But attitude is a different story. When you’re a professional in something, not only in football, you need to respect who you represent, the people who work with you, giving your all like everyone else. That’s the only reason I’m unhappy, because I feel this sensation, and because I know the process behind that attitude.” Corriere dello Sport reported that he had been talking about Rick Karsdorp. Other outlets soon followed suit, although there remains no confirmation that the Dutchman had been the subject of his wrath. Karsdorp, who replaced Zeki Çelik at right wing-back in the 65th minute, was at fault for the equaliser, tracking back lazily as Sassuolo broke down his flank. Giorgos Kyriakopoulos floated a pass down the line to Armand Laurienté, who cut it back for Pinamonti to flick home. Heartbreak for Roma \uD83D\uDC94 Just moments after Tammy Abraham scored what looked to be the winning goal, Sassuolo's Andrea Pinamonti pokes home an equalizer \uD83E\uDD2F pic.twitter.com/mU7HmznDYj — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) November 9, 2022 Mourinho had defended Karsdorp at the weekend, after the player responded to his substitution in the Rome derby by walking straight down the tunnel without acknowledging his manager or teammates. “He returned [a few minutes later] with some ice,” pointed out the Portuguese. “I don’t know if it was for his knee, his hamstring or his fever. He’s had a lot of problems this year.” With hindsight those words might be framed in a different light. Was Mourinho trying to tell us even then that this is a player who always has an excuse not to train at 100%? Or was it all just another act of misdirection by a master of the art, whose team had dropped five points in four days? Gazzetta dello Sport defined Mourinho as “an exceptional snake charmer, quickly finding the way to shift everybody’s attention”. Sassuolo celebrate after Andrea Pinamonti’s equaliser. Photograph: Serena Campanini/EPA The momentum that seemed to accompany his club in the summer, as they followed up their Europa Conference League celebrations by presenting Paulo Dybala to a crowd of thousands on the steps of the Colosseo Quadrato, has dissipated. Roma are not exactly having a bad season – they are a point better off than at the corresponding point last term – but nor have they shown any real signs of progress. Mourinho had pointed to Dybala’s absence after defeat in the derby, naming him as the only forward on Roma’s books with the creativity to open up a low block. The next player he might turn to for inspiration, Pellegrini, was forced off with an injury of his own in the second half. To lose such players would be a blow to any team. Dybala is the team’s top scorer, and Roma have also had to do without their other big-name summer signing, Georginio Wijnaldum, who fractured a tibia 10 minutes into his Serie A debut against Salernitana back in August. Then again, were Lazio not also missing their two most influential players, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Ciro Immobile? And ought the risk of injury not have been baked into any consideration of Dybala’s role? He missed 39 games for Juventus over the past two seasons, many of them due to muscle strains similar to the hamstring issue which has sidelined him since 9 October. His absence cannot explain the poor form of others. Abraham scored 17 times last season, but has only three so far in this campaign. Mourinho dropped him to the bench against Sassuolo, and his well-taken goal, stealing in front of his marker to head home Gianluca Mancini’s cross, reflected a hungry performance. A November World Cup has disrupted this season in too many ways to count, but the question of whether Abraham’s anxiousness to claim a spot in England’s squad for the tournament had impacted his play hung in the air. “Probably there was too much pressure,” he said post-match. “I really wanted to score a goal, that started a vicious cycle.” Fiorentina 2-1 Salernitana, Inter 6-1 Bologna, Torino 2-0 Sampdoria, Lecce 2-1 Atalanta, Sassuolo 1-1 Roma, Cremonese 0-0 Milan, Napoli 2-0 Empoli, Spezia 1-1 Udinese. Abraham had begun by apologising to fans, teammates and coaches for not being “the best I can be”, yet if one thing is clear with this Roma team it is that the supporters are sticking behind them. Derby defeats have produced mutinous reactions many times, but on Wednesday the away section was packed out, with a banner at its centre inviting critics to silence in crude terms, and backing “Mourinho to the bitter end”. We are a long way from that yet. The chasing pack behind Napoli at the top of Serie A are so closely clustered that Roma could yet finish the year anywhere from third to eighth. It will be fascinating to see how they approach the January transfer window as they weigh their pursuit of a top four finish. Mourinho will agitate for reinforcements, as well as for Wednesday’s scapegoat to be sent on his way.

In what the daily newspaper Il Messaggero has described as “the sack of Rai”, the “priceless” artworks were removed from the broadcaster’s headquarters in Rome and units across the country and replaced with fakes. The works included original paintings by Renato Guttuso and etchings by Claude Monet and Amedeo Modigliani. It was only by chance that Rai chiefs discovered the pieces were stolen when, a few months ago, a painting fell off the wall in an office at Rai’s headquarters, and from the broken frame it was found to be a copy of the original Architettura by Ottone Rosai. The incident was reported to Italy’s art police and before long they identified the culprit – a retired Rai employee who admitted to stealing the original painting and selling it for 25m lira in the 1970s. The man will not face justice as the statute of limitations on the crime has expired. Rai then researched its catalogue of artworks, much of which were bought in the 1960s and 70s, and found that 120 original works, including bronze and gold statues by the sculptor Francesco Messina, were missing. Police believe most of the thefts were carried out since 1996, the year Rai held an exhibition of its artworks in the Puglia city of Lecce. Police believe “disloyal employees” are most probably behind the rest of the thefts, Il Messaggero reported. Among the stolen works were an etching that Monet made of his Paysage de Verneuil, along with an etching Modigliani did of Petit Fils and one by Alfred Sisley of his Hampton Court. Other paintings stolen included Domenica della Buona Gente by Guttuso, Vita nei Campi by Giorgio De Chirico, Il Colosseo by Giovanni Stradone and Porto di Genova by Francesco Menzio. “These were works of great value that were just hanging on the walls of the corridors or rooms in Rai’s buildings, without any alarm system, and so anyone could just walk in and take them,” said Giuseppe Scarpa, a journalist covering the investigation for the newspaper.","Id":"world/2021/jun/11/italian-tv-employees-blamed-for-theft-of-dozens-of-works-of-art-rai","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Italian TV employees suspected of thieving dozens of works of art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/11/italian-tv-employees-blamed-for-theft-of-dozens-of-works-of-art-rai","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/jun/11/italian-tv-employees-blamed-for-theft-of-dozens-of-works-of-art-rai","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":367,"webPublicationDate":"2021-06-11T14:49:33Z","id":"world/2021/jun/11/italian-tv-employees-blamed-for-theft-of-dozens-of-works-of-art-rai","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"A fairytale Europe: Europa-Park, Germany","body":"You don’t expect to find la dolce vita in Germany’s Black Forest, but there we were, 1,000km north of the Italian capital, in a restaurant overlooking the piazza Roma. Children ran in and out of fountains that lit up in multiple colours, in the shadow of a red-brick, medieval tower reminiscent of Siena’s. The Pizzeria Romantica was gearing up for another busy night. Couples sat at tables outside the Commedia dell’Arte cafe, admiring the colosseum, or a bit of it. Rome’s most famous monument looms over the 350-room Hotel Colosseo, but the Italian theme runs throughout: inside, the ground-floor corridors are part-cobbled and lantern-lit, like ancient streets; restaurant walls are covered in murals of mythical scenes, and washing hangs outside the green-shuttered bedroom windows. The level of detail is impressive. Of course it’s entirely fake, but it’s not plasticky. Even the kids’ play area is wooden. And it lacks the superficial gloss you get in American themed hotels. There are no shrill “Hi, how are yous?” here, no too-white smiles. The staff, dressed in robes (naturalmente), are helpful and polite but not overbearing. The officiousness of one woman who checked our breakfast vouchers brought a welcome sense of reality to the surreal environment. A slice of Rome on the German/French/Swiss border. Photograph: EuropaPark As to why there’s a recreation of Rome in rural Germany ... the Colosseo is one of five resorts at Europa-Park theme park, where the theme is – well, you can guess. If Italy doesn’t take your fancy, the Castillo Andaluz and El Andaluz hotels immerse guests in traditional Spain, while the Santa Isabel hotel is modelled on a Portuguese monastery, complete with chapel, vaulted ceilings and a cloister garden. And in a break from the park’s European theme, the New England-flavoured Bell Rock resort is dripping in seafaring paraphernalia, with a Vegas-style fountain display every night. It’s overwhelming and bonkers – and that’s just the hotels. I’m not a theme park person. I have resisted taking my six-year-old son to Disney, or any theme park for that matter. But I was intrigued by Europa-Park. At 95 hectares, it’s by far the biggest in Germany, with 100 rides, including 13 rollercoasters spread across 13 “lands” (soon to be 14 when “Ireland – children’s world” opens later this summer). And it’s going to get bigger – much bigger: a 46-hectare water park is under construction and scheduled to open in 2018. This giant playground has been named as the best in Europe, by Tripadvisor, it costs less than Disneyland Paris and is easy to get to (we flew to Basel, then it’s an hour straight up the motorway to the small town of Rust). Yet no one I mentioned it to had heard of it, a lack of awareness borne out by the statistics. Of the park’s 5.5 million annual visitors, less than 1% are from the UK. It’s overwhelming and bonkers – and that’s just the hotels We’re missing out. I challenge even the grumpiest cynic – or indeed hardened Brexiter – not to enjoy strolling across this fantasy version of the continent, where countries are distilled down to a few iconic landmarks and attractions: England is Shakespeare and beer, represented by a replica Globe theatre and three bars, and presided over by a statue of Queen Victoria. Interestingly, it’s also neighbours with Russia – the English Sports Bar is dangerously close to the Mir space station – and they say Germans have no sense of humour … A taste of New England at the Bell Rock, the only non-European themed hotel at the resort. Photograph: EuropaPark Not that the rest of the park is geographically accurate. The Netherlands (windmills, Delft china teacup ride) is a stroll away from the fishing villages of Scandinavia, while Germany (half-timbered buildings, an original section of the Berlin wall) lies opposite Italy, the first European area to open back in 1981. And the rides? From the terrifying Blue Fire (0-100km in 2.5 seconds) and the Silver Star (130kph) to the all-wood Wodan Timbur coaster, there’s enough to churn the stomach of the most dedicated thrill-seeker. Happily I was with my partner (a wuss like me) and young son, so I had the perfect excuse to avoid the fast and furious rides and instead spent two days swinging and swaying through various magical lands. In one day we swooped past the giant insects, toadstools and characters of Minimoys Kingdom (inspired by the movie Arthur and the Invisibles), raced around Silverstone (another feature of England land), took a ride in a hot air balloon, rode a gondola through lush parkland, and glided above the park on Leonardo da Vinci’s fantastical flying machine. Aside from the rides there are numerous other distractions for young children, like splashing in fountains. Photograph: Isabel Choat/The Guardian The height of our bravery was the Atlantica SuperSplash, a boat that rises 30m in the air before hurtling into a pool at 80kmh. We ended day one on the aptly named Oldtimer Fahrt, where my son took the wheel of a classic car with his fogey parents in the back. By the end of day two we felt more courageous. While my partner got a soaking on the Poseidon water roller coaster, I braved Pegasus (minimum age 4), though I had to close my eyes and grip the safety bar for the entire two minutes of the ride. On the Silverstone race track. Photograph: Isabel Choat/The Guardian The Food Loop restaurant, where you order by touchscreen and your meal is delivered via rails, was more my kind of coaster. It was while we were watching our tomato spaghetti – safe inside a closed metal dish – and our (unopened) beers zoom down a spiral track that it struck me that our trip had not been the endurance test we’d feared; we’d had a brilliant time. One major distinction between Europa-Park and many of its rivals is that it’s family-owned. The Macks have been in the fairground business for over 200 years. Forty years ago they decided to open a park to showcase their amusement rides – and they are still running it. This, according to communications director Jakob Wahl, explains the strong family focus that ensures as much imagination and investment is put into experiences for young children as into the high-profile thrill rides. Between numerous whimsical rides, my son zipped about like a human pinball between fairytale houses with interactive story-telling and real craft workshops (Russia land), watched the daily parade of characters, hugged the Euromaus mascot, splashed about in a water play area and had to be dragged away from some water balloon catapults (one of the few attractions you have to pay extra for). Somehow we also managed to squeeze in two live shows of the 23 on offer: Return of the Black Knight (horses, jousting, stunts) in Spain, and Greece’s Surpr’Ice (skating, glitter, camp musical numbers). It wasn’t as exhausting as it sounds. We were there in May half-term when German, French and Swiss kids are at school, so we never waited more than five minutes for a ride. And the layout of the park, with its mature trees, flowerbeds, canals, lakes and gardens – including the gardens of the original 15th-century castle around which the entire site is built – gives a sense of space you don’t get in your average steel and plastic park. Watch a film with a virtual reality headset while riding the Pegasus rollercoaster. Photograph: Hans-Joerg Haas If I had to pick a drawback it would be the food. The buffet dinner at the hotel Colosseo’s Antica Roma restaurant was suitably Roman in size but not particularly inspiring, and they could take some lessons from the Italians when it comes to coffee. But even then it seems churlish to complain about one restaurant when there are so many to choose from. We ate better on the second night, dining on well-flavoured chilli, steak and turkey at the Wild West-themed Camp Resort – yet another accommodation option, with tipis, wagons and log cabins plus a saloon, and firepits where a group of German school kids shared their marshmallows with my little boy. And if we’d been prepared to splash out we could have dined on the €95 four-course menu at the Michelin-starred Ammolite at the Bel Rock hotel. Now that Europa-Park has opened an office in London and started to work with more UK tour operators it’s likely to attract more Brits. I can’t think of a more appropriate post-referendum attraction. A harmonious, fun Europe. Way to go The trip was provided by Europa-Park. For a family of four, two nights’ B&B at the Hotel Colosseo plus two days’ entry to the park costs €603 in winter (26 November-8 January) and €827 in summer (19 March-6 November).

Little do they know that relief is just around the corner – albeit at a price. The All'Ombra del Colosseo summer festival is sited at the top of the Caelian Hill, a three-minute walk from the Colosseum, and features a bar, restaurant, club, and night concerts. But that's not why most locals have heard of it. They head to All'Ombra for its pièce-de-résistance: the swimming pool. Since ancient times, Rome has been renowned for its water, which flows easily from fountains both small and monumental, all over the city. (And yes, the water that runs from the nasoni, or little fountains, is perfectly safe to drink). For those looking to cool off, though, those fountains can seem more of a tease than relief. Take the Trevi. As tempting as it might be to dip a toe in, doing so can result in a stiff fine from the police. Meanwhile, outdoor swimming pools are all but unheard of in Rome, particularly in the historic centre. That makes the pool at All'Ombra del Colosseo a rare find. So rare that you'd expect it to be packed with travellers in search of the offbeat and refreshing. But on a recent, sweltering Sunday, not a tourist was to be seen. Instead, local couples and young families stretched out on chairs and sipped soft drinks or beers, while swimmers splashed and squealed in the cool water. By early evening, the pool area was emptying out while, upstairs, workers set out the restaurant tables and readied the bar for aperitivo. In other words, the same scene you'd see at any outdoor resort, anywhere in the world. Especially since - despite the festival's name, \"In the Shade of the Colosseum\" - you can't even see the Colosseum from the pool, thanks to a thick fringe of trees. The pool snacks were predictable and overpriced – €5 fries, €10 caprese salad); the rules predictably Italian: anyone who wants to so much as wade into the pool must wear - and, if they don't own one, purchase for €1.50 - a bathing cap. Even so, there is something to be said for being able to relax, poolside, on a hill renowned for its ancient ruins. Although archaeologists and conservationists might, quite reasonably, disagree. And for being able to exit, beach tote in hand, while crossing the paths of nuns on their way up to the sixth-century church of San Gregorio Magno al Celio. At the end of the day, it's just a pool, and a pricey one at that. But you can't beat its location for novelty - or convenience. • The pool opens from 9am to 6pm until September 4. Use of the pool, a chair, umbrella, and locker rooms costs €14 weekdays (€10 for a half-day from 2pm), €18 weekends (€14 for a half-day). If you add on the use of the Jacuzzi, be prepared to shell out €20 on weekdays and €25 on the weekend. The aperitivo, with buffet, costs another €9.

The mayor of London yesterday announced rises in ticket prices of as much as 25%. Critics accused him of breaking a key manifesto pledge to freeze bus fares and to peg tube fares to inflation. A single ticket on the underground in central London will rise by 40p to £2, while bus fares outside the centre of the capital will jump by 30p to £1. The increases will be mitigated by cheaper tickets for children, at weekends, and for those paying in advance. But the overall impact will be a rise in fare receipts of £81m a year. The mayor's advisers blamed the rise on a shortfall in revenue from congestion charging, together with the ballooning cost of running hundreds of extra bus services. It emerged yesterday that the government has refused a request from Mr Livingstone for extra money in 2005, leaving a likely funding shortfall of £565m in the financial year to March 2006. Steve Norris, the Conservative mayoral candidate, said Mr Livingstone's entire spending strategy had been based on an \"astonishingly naive belief\" that the government would bail him out. Mr Norris pointed out that in the manifesto for his election in May 2000, the mayor promised to freeze bus fares for four years. \"It is, yet again, an example of Livingstone breaking one of his most central election pledges. It's been done because he has made such a mess of his budget.\" A spokesman for Mr Livingstone suggested the four-year freeze was intact because it had started at the beginning of 2000 - five months before the mayor was elected. Mr Norris described this as \"the kind of sophistry he ought to be ashamed of\". Critics pointed out that Mr Livingstone had also promised to link tube fares to the rate of inflation. The increases announced yesterday amount to an average of 3.6% - well above inflation. In an attempt to move towards a \"cashless\" transport system, the fare rises will be waived for passengers who pay in advance using the new Oyster smartcard system. The hi-tech cards, an alternative to Travelcard season tickets, allow customers to buy credits in advance for journeys on buses and tubes. In another concession, children aged under 11 will travel free on all London's buses. Anyone aged under 16 will get free travel on buses, tubes and trams at weekends if they are accompanied by adults. Rufus Barnes, chairman of the London Transport Users' Committee, welcomed the changes for children, but warned adult fare rises must not be repeated: \"We need to see this as a one-off change. It would be totally unacceptable for single-journey fare in creases of this magnitude to be repeated in future years.\" The mayor has overseen an unprecedented growth in London's bus network, with hundreds of new vehicles operating additional routes. But the cost has been substantial - bus subsidies are up from £100m to £600m since 2001 and are likely to reach £1.1bn by 2008. Meanwhile, the congestion charging scheme has proved to be a victim of its own success, with fewer vehicles entering central London than expected. It is likely to yield annual revenues of £65m, rather than the expected £130m. Yesterday's tube fare rises were concentrated on the centre of London, where Mr Livingstone said passengers were more likely to be well off, tourists, or out of towners who had not contributed through council tax. But John Biggs, Labour's transport spokesman in the London assembly, said: \"It's the casual users who will pay the largest rise. It doesn't do much for the socially excluded, who are unlikely to buy pre-paid credit for transport.\" Ticket to ride Central underground journeys · London Notting Hill Gate to Farringdon - £1.60 (rising to £2 next year) · Berlin Kurfürstendamm to Alexanderplätz - £1.50 · New York Grand Central to Wall Street - 95p · Paris Place Charles de Gaulle to Republique - 88p · Rome Colosseo to Tiburtina - 55p","Id":"politics/2003/aug/20/uk.london","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Mayor's £500m shortfall forces up fares","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/aug/20/uk.london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2003/aug/20/uk.london","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":686,"webPublicationDate":"2003-08-20T01:26:58Z","id":"politics/2003/aug/20/uk.london","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"What's on when","body":"Virtually Blue Suede Shoes Date: March 9.
