While it only represents a single data point, this could be signalling a softening in a labour market which has been very resilient to interest rate hikes to date. USD is at the margin bearish for today’s session, and overall this could dampen the probability of a hike for the June FOMC Meeting.” 2.24pm BST Here’s some snap reaction to the jump in US jobless claims last week, reported today: The week ending June 3 saw 261,000 initial unemployment claims, jumping from 233,000 for the week ending May 27.

GMB members at the site made a formal request for recognition to the independent central arbitration committee (CAC) last month after a concerted recruitment drive for members that it believed took it past the necessary threshold of support. Workers at the vast depot, known as BHX4, have held a series of strike days since January – the first at a UK Amazon facility - and the GMB says membership has more than quadrupled to 800. The union believed that comfortably represented more than half of the 1,400 staff it estimated to be working at the site, enough to prompt the CAC to grant statutory recognition. On the basis of evidence submitted by the firm, however, the Guardian understands the CAC has endorsed Amazon’s statement that as many as 2,700 people are now employed there. Here’s the full story, by my colleague Heather Stewart: Related: GMB halts bid for official Amazon union claiming firm skewed staff numbers Further strike action at Amazon Coventry will take place on 12, 13 and 14 of June, the GMB have announced. Updated at 1.33pm BST 1.09pm BST Full story: Eurozone sinks into recession as cost of living crisis takes toll The eurozone slipped into recession in the first three months of the year, after official figures were revised to show the bloc’s economy shrank as the rising cost of living weighed on consumer spending. Figures from Eurostat, the EU’s statistical agency, showed gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.1% in the first quarter of 2023 and the final three months of 2022 after revisions to earlier estimates. A technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Previous estimates suggested the single-currency bloc had narrowly avoided recession with zero growth in both quarters. The updated figures showed the wider EU swerved a recession after GDP rose by 0.1% in the first three months of the year, after a contraction of 0.2% in the final quarter of 2022. The UK avoided entering a recession at the start of the year, while growth in the US also remained positive. However, GDP volumes in the eurozone and the EU are more than 2% higher than the level recorded in the final quarter of 2019 before the Covid pandemic struck – unlike in the UK, where the economy remains 0.5% smaller.

GDP across the EU rose by 0.1% in January-March, after shrinking by 0.2% in October-December, meaning it avoided two consecutive quarterly falls in a row. Poland was the fastest-growing EU member, with its GDP rising by 3.8% in Q1 2023. FYI, revised data do indeed show the #euro area is already in #recession (though not yet the EU as a while, thanks to strong Q1 growth in #Poland in particular)... \uD83D\uDC47 https://t.co/10hYG3FnfG pic.twitter.com/aO1iBhy5Qu — Julian Jessop (@julianHjessop) June 8, 2023 12.40pm BST The news that the eurozons has fallen into recession is “not a major surprise”, Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, tells clients today: He says: When Putin started to close the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline in stages last June, we had predicted that the spike in gas and electricity prices and gas shortage fears would likely push the Eurozone into recession over the winter. Instead, two other aspects are noteworthy, Schmieding adds: First, initial data had suggested that the Eurozone had avoided a recession, with stagnation in late 2022 and even slight growth in early 2023, causing observers like us to raise our calls. Second, whereas the Eurozone had coped with the Putin shock rather well over the winter, two unrelated factors turned the underlying expansion in economic activity into a contraction in real GDP in early 2023. Without an Irish accounting quirk and a post-COVID-19 plunge in German government spending, the Eurozone economy would have printed growth of almost 0.4% qoq in Q1, in line with the solid PMI readings in early 2023 and a 0.23% qoq gain in gross value added in Q1. https://t.co/29hCNVAWYG Eurozone GDP: the really weird winter \"recession\" #Eurozone #GDP #recession #macroeconomics pic.twitter.com/iACvmdafJ1 — Berenberg Economics (@Berenberg_Econ) June 8, 2023 Updated at 12.54pm BST 12.38pm BST UK spent £40bn on winter energy support The cost of subsidising UK energy costs for households and businesses last winter hit almost £40bn. New government figures show that protecting households and businesses from spiralling energy bills between October 2022 and March 2023 cost £39.3bn. That is the most ever provided to subsidise household bills in UK history, and works out at £215m per day. It follows Liz Truss’s decision to cap typical bills at £2,500 per year. Energy Security Secretary Grant Shapps said: “Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and his reckless attempts to hold the West to ransom sent energy prices spiralling around the world. “We acted swiftly and decisively to protect families and businesses from the full impact of that shock – covering around half a typical energy bill over winter. This helped safeguard jobs and livelihoods, and enabled many families to heat their homes.” “And we will not stop leading the world in standing up to Putin, helping countries around the world to move away from Russian fossil fuels – just as we have done having not used any Russian gas for the past 12 months.” 12.24pm BST Sky: Telegraph owner tables last-ditch bid to keep control of newspapers There is a twist in the battle over the future of the Daily Telegraph. Sky News are reporting that the Barclay family, which lost control of their crown jewel media assets yesterday, have tabled a proposal to restructure its debt and regain control. The move comes a day after the Bank of Scotland appointed receivers to seize the shares owned by the Barclay family in the holding company that ultimately controls the national newspapers and the Spectator magazine. Related: Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph newspapers to be put up for sale Sky News’s Mark Kleinman explains: Sky News has learnt that the Barclay family submitted an offer to Lloyds Banking Group on Wednesday that would have entailed the bank writing off a portion of the roughly-£1bn it is owed. Further details of the proposal - which followed one last week and was the latest in a series made by the Barclays in recent months - were unclear, although sources said it had been rejected by Bank of Scotland, the Lloyds subsidiary which is owed the money. Carlyle, the private equity firm which already holds a portion of debt attached to Barclay-backed companies including the online shopping business Very Group, is understood to be involved in the talks with the family. He adds, though, that the prospects of a deal being reached by the two sides “appear remote”. Revealed: The Barclay family tabled a last-ditch proposal on Wednesday to restructure its debt to Lloyds Banking Group in an attempt to regain control of The Daily Telegraph, its Sunday sister newspaper and The Spectator magazine.

The online fashion chain has told the City that Frasers, the group behind Sports Direct, now owns 9.86% of ASOS’s stock, up from 8.8%. Earlier this week, Frasers bumped up its stake from 7.4%. Today’s move takes Frasers closes to owning a 10% stake which gives it the power to block a statutory compulsory share purchase after any takeover offer. It would give Mike Ashley, founder of Sports Direct, a seat at the table if a bid for ASOS does emerge. My colleague Sarah Butler reported on Tuesday: Asos is seen as a potential target after José Antonio Ramos Calamonte, the chief executive of Asos, who took over last summer, was forced to reveal a £291m loss in the six months to 28 February after sales fell by 8%, including a 10% drop in the UK amid what it called a “challenging trading backdrop”. Povlsen and Camelot Capital Partners, a US hedge fund founded by young financier William Barker, who wants to emulate his hero Warren Buffett, both led the way in a recent £75m equity raise by Asos last month – part of refinancing package to replace a £350m loan, which was due to be repaid next year. Camelot, Asos’s second largest shareholder, has shown an interest in online fashion players, also snapping up a stake in the UK’s Boohoo in recent months. 11.58am BST Very weak domestic demand helped to push the eurozone into recession, says Daniel Kral, senior economist at Oxford Economics. As had been apparent from national data, today's downward revision to Q1 growth confirms that the Eurozone experienced a technical recession over winter by the smallest of margins (-0.1% q/q in Q4 and Q1). Very weak domestic demand was partially offset by net trade. https://t.co/IqyWFTun3n pic.twitter.com/CUXymjz95C — Daniel Kral (@DanielKral1) June 8, 2023 11.49am BST AP: Europe's economy has shrunk. For households that are hurting, it's just numbers The eurozone’s winter contraction shows the impact of the loss of Russian natural gas and high inflation on consumer spending, reports Associated Press. They say: The economic growth figure for the 20 countries that use the euro currency was revised down from zero to minus 0.1% for the fourth quarter of 2022. The number for the first three months of this year also was downgraded from scant 0.1% growth to minus 0.1%. That means the eurozone endured two consecutive quarters of declining output, which is one definition of recession often used in political and economic discussions, dubbed a “technical” recession. The small shift in numbers doesn’t change what households already were experiencing: rising prices at the grocery store, paying more interest on their mortgages and struggling for wages that keep up with the rising cost of living. 11.25am BST Today’s news that the Eurozone fell into a (slight) recession should make the ECB’s policymakers pause a bit before pressing with higher interest rates, says Professor Costas Milas, of the University of Liverpool’s Management School. Professor Milas tells us: What worries me is Germany’s financial stress index which takes into account movements in interest rates and financial asset volatility such as the volatility of the stock market and/or the exchange rate. Currently, the index is fairly elevated (in historical terms) which signals that Eurozone’s GDP will struggle 12 to 18 months into the future. This is also bad news for the UK because Eurozone’s potential underperformance will also hit the UK economy on the top of current predictions that show anaemic UK growth…. Updated at 11.33am BST 11.25am BST As well as falling into recession, the eurozone is lagging behind major advanced economies. The UK, for example, avoided recession last winter by growing 0.1% in October-December, and again in January-March. The US grew faster – expanding by around 0.3% in Q1, and 0.6% in Q4 2022. Japan’s economy made a decent start to the year, growing by 0.7% in the January-March quarter, new revised data today showed. 11.12am BST Dan O’Brien, chief economist of the Institute of International and European Affairs, says the eurozone would have avoided today’s technical recession if Ireland’s GDP was excluded. More 'technical recession' news, as today's data show GDP in the eurozone shrank for the 2nd quarter on the trot. In both quarters the decline was marginal, -0.1%. Effective stagnation over the October-March not bad given headwinds.

Ireland’s Gross National Product (GNP) – a measure of economic activity that excludes the profits of multinationals – shrank by 8.0% in the quarter. But a third measure called “Modified Domestic Demand”, that tracks underlying domestic activity, rose by 2.7% in the quarter. Eurozone not in recession imo.

The eurozone has fallen into a technical recession but with the labour market still so strong @bertcolijn says it’s hard to argue that this is a recessionary environmenthttps://t.co/8MlcJjbTfA — ING Economics (@ING_Economics) June 8, 2023 Colijn points out that the contractions in Q4 2022 and Q1 2023 are small (just 0.1%), and that eurozone employment has kept rising, saying: The decline of 0.1% in both the fourth and first quarters is so minimal though, and the labour market is so strong that it’s hard to argue that this is a recessionary environment. The stagnation of the economy does mark a clear cut from the recent post-pandemic boom though. The significant downward revision was mainly due to Germany revising down its numbers as new data came in. This fuels the idea that March activity was very weak, making a quick rebound in the second quarter unlikely. With May survey data being weak across the board, it is likely that we only get a modest uptick after the two quarters of downturn. Overall, the eurozone economy is very much back to muddling through, as monetary policy starts to weigh more heavily on activity, post-pandemic spending fades and the energy crisis looms. The two quarters negative growth in the eurozone do not make for a full recession obviously, especially with declining unemployment. That combination does make for absolutely dismal productivity growth though, which is much more worrying from a longer term perspective. pic.twitter.com/RUMCaVkLWi — Bert Colijn (@BertColijn) June 8, 2023 Updated at 11.02am BST 10.47am BST The good news for the eurozone is that energy prices are much, much lower than last summer. Month-ahead European wholesale gas prices are trading around a two-year low, recovering from their surge after the Ukraine invasion. Dutch front-month gas, Europe’s benchmark, is trading around €28 per megawatt-hour today, down from over €300/MwH last August. Last month it dropped to around €25/MwH, the lowest since May 2021. This markets expert argues that, despite falling into recession, the eurozone has avoided a real calamity – the energy crisis didn’t lead to gas shortages, helped by a mild winter: Let's be honest here, last summer, anyone in the Eurozone would have given their right arm for a technical recession rather than something far worse. The renormalisation of gas prices has had a huge impact — BisphamGreen (@BisphamGreen) June 8, 2023 Updated at 10.47am BST 10.40am BST With the effect of higher interest rates still to be fully felt, economic activity in the eurozone will “remain sluggish during the rest of 2023.”, predicts Diego Iscaro, Head of European Economics at S&P Global Market Intelligence. Iscaro adds: We don’t expect the contraction in activity during the first quarter to dissuade the ECB (European Central Bank) from rising interest rates in next week’s meeting, when we see rates rising by 25 basis points. However, the figures reinforce our view that, while policy rates will rise further in the short term, they are nearing their peak.” 10.37am BST Eurozone expected to \"remain subdued in the second and third quarters\" News that the eurozone economy is shrinking will create a headache for the European Central Bank. Euro area annual inflation is expected to be 6.1 % in May 2023, down from 7.0 % in April 2023, but still three-times higher than the ECB’s target. But the weaker-than-expected economy complicates the decision facing the ECB as it weighs up whether to raise borrowing costs to cool demand. Tom Hopkins, portfolio manager at BRI Wealth Management, says: “The growth figure, coupled with data showing inflation remaining stubborn in several eurozone countries, complicates the challenge facing the region’s rate-setters, who must decide whether to continue raising borrowing costs. We believe the eurozone’s performance will remain subdued in the second and third quarters as softer bank lending pulls down investment and consumer confidence remains fragile.” 10.33am BST Eurozone GDP: the details Falling household and government spending helped to push the eurozone into recession. Household final consumption expenditure decreased by 0.3% in the euro area during the first three months of this year, following a 1% drop in the fourth quarter of 2022. Government final consumption expenditure (which tracks government spending on goods and services) decreased by 1.6% in the euro area in January-March. Gross fixed capital formation, which tracks investment, increased by 0.6% in Q1. But trade deteriorated. Exports decreased by 0.1% in the euro area while imports dropped by 1.3%, showing that demand was hit by the cost of living squeeze.

But… this is the smallest possible recession – just two quarters of a modest contraction in economic output. Bloomberg adds: But policymakers will take heart that their billions of euros in aid for households across the bloc meant that fears of much more severe economic damage in the wake of Russia’s invasion didn’t come to pass.

GDP across the euro area shrank by 0.1% in the first quarter of this year, downgraded from a previous estimate that the economy stagnated. That follows a 0.1% contraction in GDP in the fourth quarter of last year, meaning the eurozone has shrunk for two quarters in a row – the standard definition of a recession. It was dragged down by Ireland, where GDP fell by 4.6% in the first quarter of this year – although economists have questioned whether that really reflects the performance of the Irish economy.

The Treasury Committee has been investigating retail banks since February, when UK interest rates were 4%. At that stage, the big four banks offered between 0.5% and 0.65% on their easy access savings accounts. Today, they’re offering between 0.7% and 1.35%, while Bank Rate has been raised to 4.5%. Harriett Baldwin MP, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “With the Bank of England confirming the pass through of base rate increases to easy access savings accounts has been unusually weak, it’s clearer than ever that the nation’s biggest banks need to up their game and encourage saving. While other products are available to those who shop around, the measly easy access rates on offer lead us to conclude that loyal customers are being squeezed to bolster bank profit margins. “We remain concerned that the loyalty penalty is especially prominent for elderly and vulnerable customers who may still rely on high street bank branches.” 8.58am BST It would be a mistake for the government to heed calls from housebuilders to restart the Help To Buy scheme, argues Graham Cox, founder of the Bristol-based broker, SelfEmployedMortgageHub.com. Help To Buy, introduced in 2013, provided government-backed loans to purchase a new-build home, and shut at the end of March. Homebuilders benefitted from the pick-up in sales, so it’s not surprising that Crest Nicholson is today urging ministers to provide some form of assistance. Cox says: “Desperation emanates from every word of Crest Nicholson’s trading statement, as they implore the government to do something, anything, to stem the tide. No doubt they would love Help to Buy to make a comeback, as they’ve made huge profits off the back of it over the past decade. It would, however, be a huge mistake, which is not to say the government won’t make it, particularly with the Tories languishing in the polls. What really helps people buy is cheaper house prices. Help to Buy only increases them.” Former chancellor George Osborne has claimed that Help to Buy “helped hundreds of thousands of families buy their own home and supported thousands of construction jobs”. Housing experts, though, warn that it inflated the housing market and swelled housebuilders’ profits. Related: 10 years on, what did George Osborne’s Help to Buy scheme really achieve? 8.43am BST There are jitters in the bond markets this week, as traders recognise that global central banks are far from finished fighting inflation. Bond prices have fallen, driving up the yield (or interest rate) on government borrowing, which is a sign that investors expect interest rates to keep rising. Already this week, two central banks – in Australia and Canada – have surprised the markets by raising borrowing costs, when they were expected to hold them steady. This morning, UK short-term borrowing costs have hit the highest level since the mini-budget turmoil last autumn.

The latest Jobs Survey from KPMG and REC has found that economic uncertainty continued to dampen hiring activity in May. Hiring in hospitality, healthcare and engineering remained strong, but demand is weakening in construction, IT and retail. Permanent staff appointments fell for the eighth month in a row, as companies cut back on hiring, with vacancies expanding at the second-softest rate since early 2021. Caution around the outlook and delayed decision-making led to a further marked fall in permanent staff appointments, while temp billings rose only slightly, recruitment consultants reported. Neil Carberry, REC chief executive, said: “Despite the overall temporary work market continuing to grow – and permanent hiring declining from the sugar rush of 2022 – the story can vary widely across different businesses as their economic outlook remains unclear.” 8.01am BST In the travel sector, budget airline Wizz Air is hopeful of returning to profit this year. Wizz almost doubled its passenger numbers in the last financial year, to 31 March, carrying 51m (a company record), up from 27m the previous year when pandemic disruption hit demand. That helped narow its losses by 16% in the last financial year, to €535m. And it hopes to make a net profit this financial year of €350m-€450m, helped by increased demand. However, “adverse exogenous events” such as an incremental impact from the war in Ukraine or delays to deliveries of new planes could disrupt that. 7.43am BST Housebuilder Crest Nicholson warns higher interest rates will hit demand One of the UK’s building firms is warning of a further slowdown in the housing market this morning too, and urging more action from the government. Crest Nicholson has reported a fall in revenues in the six months to 30 April to £282.7m, down from £364m a year before. Adjusted pre-tax profits more than halved to £20.9m, from £52.5m. Peter Truscott, chief executive, says the period began amid “the worst of the economic uncertainty arising from the September 2022 mini-budget”. Rapidly falling consumer confidence and rising interest rates immediately led to softer demand in the housing market, Truscott explains. And although confidence has returned, Crest Nicholson fears that rising interest rates will cool demand further. Truscott says: The economic case for buying a home therefore remains compelling, but for many first time buyers the higher cost of borrowing and the cessation of Help to Buy are prohibitive to realising this ambition. If interest rates continue to rise, and remain elevated for a sustained period of time, this will undoubtedly exacerbate this issue even further and start to impact demand and confidence again. We continue to call on Government to recognise this challenge and provide further support to these potential homeowners. Mortgage rates in the UK have been rising in recent weeks, and some lenders have also pulled deals from the market.

Updated at 7.44am BST 7.42am BST Introduction: ‘Storm clouds are gathering’ for the property market, warn surveyors Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Storm clouds are gathering over the UK property market, according to the country’s surveyors. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) is warning this morning that expectations of further interest rate rises from the Bank of England may put renewed downward pressure on the market in the months ahead. RICS’s monthly healthcheck on the property sector has found some improvement in market conditions during May, with the first rise in new instructions since early 2022. House prices continue to fall in much of England, although Scotland and Northern Ireland have witnessed an uplift. RICS Senior Economist, Tarrant Parsons, says there was a modest recovery in the sales market activity during May, with generally less negativity compared to the end of 2022. But he warns that expectations of further interest rate hikes will hit demand and affordability. “However, it seems storm clouds are gathered, with the UK’s stubbornly high inflation likely undermining the recent improvement in activity by prompting the Bank of England to take further action through interest rate rises, leading to higher mortgage rates and ultimately reducing affordability and buyer demand. The banking sector appears to expect this with many banks and building societies already introducing products with higher interest rates. MKT condition metrics look sunnier in May but recent inflation blow could see storm clouds closing in. -New buyer enquiries inc from -34% in April to -18%. -New instructions inc +14% -Surveyors cite further falls in national prices of -30% (least neg fig in 3mths) @RICSnews pic.twitter.com/hgGey1dTXD — Emma Fildes (@emmafildes) June 8, 2023 Yesterday morning, Halifax reported that house prices experienced their first annual fall in more than a decade last month. Related: UK house prices experience annual fall for first time in decade, data shows The Bank of England has already raised interest rates 12 times in a row, and the City currently expects another rise this month, from 4.5% to 4.75%. They could hit 5.5% by the end of the year, the money markets indicate. Interest rate rises are also impacting the rental sector, encouraging landlords to leave the sector and sell up property, Parsons adds. Also coming up today The UK’s financial regulator has unveiled a major shake-up of the rules around marketing of cryptoassets. The crackdown from the Financial Conduct Authority will include banning the so-called “refer a friend” bonuses that are popular in the industry. Promoters must also ensure adverts are clear, fair and not misleading, and ensure people have the appropriate knowledge and experience to invest in crypto. Sheldon Mills, executive director at Consumers and Competition, said: “It is up to people to decide whether they buy crypto. But research shows many regret making a hasty decision. Our rules give people the time and the right risk warnings to make an informed choice. “Consumers should still be aware that crypto remains largely unregulated and high risk. Those who invest should be prepared to lose all their money. “The crypto industry needs to prepare now for this significant change. We are working on additional guidance to help them meet our expectations.” Related: Crypto ads will need to carry risk warnings under new UK rules The agenda 9.30am BST: Latest UK economic activity and business insight data 10am BST: Eurozone growth figures for Q1 2023 (third estimate) 1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless data Updated at 7.49am BST","Id":"business/live/2023/jun/08/uk-housing-market-housebuilder-interest-rate-rises-stock-market-ftse-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webTitle":"Eurozone falls into recession; US jobless claims jump – business live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jun/08/uk-housing-market-housebuilder-interest-rate-rises-stock-market-ftse-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2023/jun/08/uk-housing-market-housebuilder-interest-rate-rises-stock-market-ftse-business-live","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":4602,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T13:26:24Z","id":"business/live/2023/jun/08/uk-housing-market-housebuilder-interest-rate-rises-stock-market-ftse-business-live","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"World Test Championship final: Australia v India, day two – live","body":"2.26pm BST 1st over: India 5-0 (Sharma 5, Gill 0) Rohit gets off the mark second ball with the smoothest of swivel-pulls for four. Nothing much else to report, mainly because I was busy changing the furniture on this article. 2.19pm BST Thanks Geoff, hello everyone. The Australian players are back out on the field, and we’re about to find out what 469 is worth on this pitch. Mitchell Starc will open the bowling. 2.15pm BST That’s enough from me, Rob Smyth will take over for the rest of the day. 2.12pm BST Australia set 469 in the first innings 121.3 overs: Australia 469-10 (Boland 1) The not out player is Boland, who will now prepare to bowl first change. Mitchell Starc is already in the middle doing some warm-up bowling, only a minute or so after the final wicket fell. Cummins will join him shortly. It looks a substantial total given that the pitch was still offering decent bounce and carry, some erratic bounce on occasion, and it has some cracks starting to open up. Not that it’s a minefield but it’ll give good bowlers something. Siraj finishes with 4 for 108, Shami 2 for 122, Thakur 2 for 83, and Jadeja 1 for 56. Umesh is the wicketless one, conceding 77. Updated at 2.17pm BST 2.10pm BST WICKET! Cummins c Rahane b Siraj 9, Australia all out 469 That’s the end of that. Cummins decides to take one on, slapping a length ball over cover, except that it doesn’t get over cover. Rahane is set quite deep and has time to get into position for the catch. The Australian captain didn’t middle one in his fairly lengthy stay, but he won’t mind much: 469 is fair old total. Pat Cummins is caught in the deep for nine runs, and that is that for the Australian innings. Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 2.16pm BST 2.04pm BST 121st over: Australia 469-9 (Cummins 9, Boland 1) None Shall Pass, says Aesop Rock ft. Scott Boland, as the Victorian blunts six Jadeja deliveries without moving from the crease. 2.03pm BST 120th over: Australia 469-9 (Cummins 9, Boland 1) Off the mark immediately is Scott Boland, tucking a ball through square leg to keep strike. 2.02pm BST WICKET! Lyon b Siraj 9, Australia 468 for 9 Siraj gets the next one. Replacing Umesh at the Pavilion End, from wide on the crease, he angles one in and gets it to move further off the seam. Lyon aims a huge drive and is beaten on the inside edge to lose off stump. That’s one ball after Siraj gave away another four byes with a short ball after Lyon missed his hook. 1.59pm BST 119th over: Australia 463-8 (Cummins 8, Lyon 9) No run from a short Jadeja over, Lyon blocking out the lot. 1.59pm BST 118th over: Australia 463-8 (Cummins 8, Lyon 9) Up on his toes, Lyon, and punching Umesh out through extra cover for four! Effective shot. Three slips waiting behind him, plenty of gaps. Cover gets plugged. Umesh strikes pad but it’s going down leg. Lyon places a two and a one either side of the wicket. He’s already outscored Cummins. 1.49pm BST 117th over: Australia 456-8 (Cummins 8, Lyon 2) With that very open stance of his, Lyon tries to wrist Jadeja through the packed leg side field for one. Can’t do it. Pushes to point instead and gets off strike. Cummins has a deep cover point, long off, long on and deep backward square for any big shots, but deep midwicket is open. He simply defends a couple with a straight bat. 1.47pm BST 116th over: Australia 455-8 (Cummins 8, Lyon 1) Not sure you’ll see this batting pair hang around long. A couple of singles, Umesh still smashing that length. Then Cummins tries to swing one over the leg side, not short enough and he gets little of it. Rohit sends a deep square leg out. Umesh goes headhunting, but too high and Cummins goes down the elevator shaft easily. 1.43pm BST 115th over: Australia 453-8 (Cummins 7, Lyon 0) Spinner versus spinner, Jadeja to Nathan Lyon, who blocks the last two of the over. Updated at 1.47pm BST 1.42pm BST WICKET! Carey lbw Jadeja 48, Australia 453 for 8 Jadeja comes on for a whirl, left-arm spin. Around the wicket to both the right-handed Cummins adn the left-handed Carey. Cummins is off strike immediately, a simple straight punch. Carey misses his first ball, past the outside edge, and after it hits the keeper he picks it up and hands it back. Can’t be doing that, Alex. India don’t appeal but they have the right to. Next ball, Carey launches it for six! Over wide long on, gets up and under it. And the next he goes down for a reverse sweep, plays over the top of it, and is hit on the back thigh. Fair enough that the standing umpire says not out: Carey might have gloved it, he’s got a big stride forward, and it’s not clear where it hit him. But India review, and the slow-mo shows it hitting him on the inside of the back thigh, down low, and no contact from bat or glove. Alex Carey is given out after a long look from the third umpire. Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP Updated at 1.59pm BST 1.36pm BST 114th over: Australia 446-7 (Carey 42, Cummins 6) Down crouches Cummins, and blocks out an Umesh yorker. Off strike next ball with an edge past the stumps. Wonder if that was another low bounce one. Umesh spins at the top of his mark, gets onto Carey’s pads, and some good T20 running sees Carey back for two as fine leg has to move inward and around to the ball placed squarer. Last ball of the over he is beaten again. Umesh is a new bowler today, and hasn’t had any luck. 1.31pm BST 113th over: Australia 443-7 (Carey 40, Cummins 5) Shami from the Vauxhall End, tight on Carey’s off stump as well. The view from here is right behind Shami’s arm when he bowls around the wicket. Carey glides, and places it fine enough to beat the deep backward point for four. Loves that shot. The next ball cuts back, nearly through him, into the thigh pad and could so easily have spun back onto the stumps. It misses, and Carey follows it with another boundary, picking off the attempted yorker that is a tad underpitched, sending it away behind square leg. Lovely timing. This is now a very useful score from Carey. And he garnishes it with four more, another flick of a full and straight ball, this time well in front of square to the other side of the futile sweeper. 1.26pm BST 112th over: Australia 431-7 (Carey 28, Cummins 5) Wonder if there was a decision made at lunch to go hard from here? Carey again thrashes at a couple and misses. Umesh is bowling much better than yesterday, a nice line tight to the stumps and a tough length, with good pace rushing through the shot as well. Sprints up with the pavilion at his back and lets the ball go, Carey dashes a single, Cummins watches one zip by his off stump. 1.24pm BST 111th over: Australia 430-7 (Carey 27, Cummins 5) Very nice shot from Cummins facing Shami, placing the flick through midwicket and coming back for three. The left-handed Carey plays a similar shot and hits it more sweetly for four. 1.23pm BST 110th over: Australia 422-7 (Carey 22, Cummins 2) Umesh Yadav to resume after lunch, and Carey starts in dicey fashion. Throws the bat a couple of times and makes no contact. One ball keeps low in there, too. The inconsistent bounce will interest Starc and Cummins greatly. 12.44pm BST Here’s something for your lunchtime pondering. Steve Smith moved up a spot on another record list by making his 7th Test century in England. That’s the equal second most for a visiting player, behind Guess Who. It made me wonder which visiting players have the most in the other Test countries, so here are the answers. This list refers to hundreds in that country, not against that country. England Big Don Bradman 11 Steve Smith, Steve Waugh 7 Australia Jack Hobbs 9 Wally Hammond 7 Virat Kohli, Herbert Sutcliffe, Sachin Tendulkar 6 West Indies Sunil Gavaskar 7 Ricky Ponting 5 India Alastair Cook 5 Hashim Amla, Clive Lloyd, Everton Weekes 4 South Africa Tendulkar 5 Hammond, Neil Harvey 4 Sri Lanka Tendulkar 5 Bangladesh Tendulkar 5 Pakistan Mohinder Armanath, Aravinda da Silva 4 Zimbabwe Kallis, Marvan Atapattu 3 New Zealand Kallis, Weekes, Greg Chappell, Asanka Gurusinha, Desmond Haynes, Javed Miandad, Kumar Sangakkara, Alec Stewart, Graham Thorpe 3 12.40pm BST Lunch - Australia 422 for 7 Substantial progress for India in that session – they got through Head and Smith without either overnight not out player adding a huge amount of damage, and they took out Green and Starc as well. But Australia’s initial foundation meant everyone was able to score at a decent rate, adding 95 runs for the session. Australia’s total is likely already be too many for India – though of course India might also come out and make 600. Three wickets in hand when Australia resume. 12.36pm BST 109th over: Australia 422-7 (Carey 22, Cummins 2) Some weird decisions from Rohit – bowling Umesh for one over before drinks wasn’t quite as odd, but asking Shami to warm up for one over before lunch seems like it’s not in your bowler’s best interests. Any rate. He bowls a no-ball and concedes a single to Carey, and that is sandwich time. 12.29pm BST 108th over: Australia 420-7 (Carey 21, Cummins 2) Siraj is planning his bouncer attack. Three in the deep on the leg side. Deep third, set quite fine. And Siraj goes with the bluff, trying the yorker, but misses his length and bowls it a touch wide. Carey is already backing away, and is able to deflect it behind point point for four. Then gets a short ball that he can bunt away to leg while mid hop, another run to the total. Two slips for Cummins, with a short leg as well… and Siraj bowls a horrible bouncer, way down leg, over the batter and past the keeper for four more extras. There’s 420 for Australia, blaze up. 12.22pm BST 107th over: Australia 410-7 (Carey 16, Cummins 2) Driving out to deep cover is Carey. He hasn’t tried anything adventurous so far. Not long until the lunch break now, probably the plan is simply to bat India as deeply into the fifth session as possible. Cummins gets his first runs, placing Thakur through midwicket for two. 12.18pm BST 106th over: Australia 407-7 (Carey 15, Cummins 0) Siraj short to Carey, who plays a nice hook shot but only gets one run with deep square leg back. Siraj stays short to Cummins who evades comfortably enough. 12.13pm BST 105th over: Australia 406-7 (Carey 14, Cummins 0) Another sniff of a run out as Cummins turns a ball to midwicket and both batters set off, stutter, and go back as the throw comes in. Shardul bumps Cummins, perhaps getting in before Cummins can do the same, hitting him on the arm. Then strays down leg, allowing Cummins to add four to the team’s score off his thigh pad. Technically though it’s still a maiden over. 12.09pm BST 104th over: Australia 402-7 (Carey 14, Cummins 0) The captain joins his wicketkeeper in the middle. Carey on strike defends to end the over. 12.08pm BST WICKET! Starc run out Axar Patel 5, Australia 402-7 There’s one! Starc’s call, Starc’s error. He drives straight, not forcefully back past the bowler. Sees mid on moving to his left, knows he’ll have to field left-handed. So Starc takes on the run. The only problem is that it’s the sub fielder, Axar Patel, and he’s left-handed. So Axar picks up cleanly and throws down the stumps on the bounce, across his body. Good fielding. Carey honoured the call because he had his back to the ball and was running to the safer end. Fair enough. Starc goes, a metre short. Mitchell Starc is run out after a great piece of fielding by Patel. Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 12.15pm BST 12.04pm BST 103rd over: Australia 400-6 (Carey 13, Starc 4) There’s the 400 for Australia, with a couple of singles from Thakur’s bowling. More wickets needed urgently for India, it looks like there’s still enough in this surface to give Australia’s bowlers a chance. 12.02pm BST 102nd over: Australia 398-6 (Carey 12, Starc 3) The ball is still doing a bit! Umesh gets one to swerve through the air, beating the keeper down the leg side to the fence. Whoops. Starc drives a couple of runs through cover. 11.53am BST 101st over: Australia 391-6 (Carey 11, Starc 1) Similar pattern, Carey steers a single second ball of the over and leaves the business end to Starc. The tall bowler opens his account with a run to midwicket nudged off his pad. Carey adds another. They draw Australia closer to 400. 11.49am BST 100th over: Australia 388-6 (Carey 9, Starc 0) Happy to take a single is Carey, turned to midwicket. Starc leaves one, wafts at another. Umesh got Starc out in his reversing spell of 3 for 12 in the first innings at Indore a couple of months ago, a performance that kept India in the game for a while after having been bowled out for 109. Starc survives this time. 11.46am BST 99th over: Australia 387-6 (Carey 8, Starc 0) With that wicket under his belt, Shardul Thakur is suddenly into his stride. Bowls a good tight line at the body of the left-handed Starc, a bit of movement through the air even when the length isn’t full. We’ve seen some fine spells from him over the past couple of years. Bowls a straightening line across Starc to follow that nearly draws a nick behind. India have clawed back into the contest in this session, they can’t afford to let the lower order get Australia up around 450 though. 11.43am BST WICKET! Smith b Thakur 121, Australia 387 for 6 That’s the one! The Oval erupts as Smith’s stumps light up. Shardul Thakur on for a trundle, and that must be close to the most harmless ball that has ever got Smith out. A warm-up ball, well outside the off stump, and for some reason Smith leaves his bat hanging out there, well away from his body. It takes the inside edge, and he doesn’t get the lucky runs that Carey enjoyed in the previous over. He just gets dismissed. The bails fly as Steve Smith is bowled by Sharldul Thakur. Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images Updated at 2.14pm BST 11.41am BST 98th over: Australia 387-5 (Smith 121, Carey 8) Streaky from Carey, chops a shot off the inside edge past his stumps for four. Umesh’s fruitless bowling innings continues. 11.34am BST 97th over: Australia 382-5 (Smith 120, Carey 4) Off the mark with a boundary is Carey, opening the face and steering behind point. Shami is bowling around the wicket to him, two slips and a gully in place. Smashes him on the pad last ball of the over, going down the leg side I fancy. Control+C, Control+V, another big appeal from a backward-running Shami, and this time Rohit shapes to request the review… and doesn’t. Pulls his arms away from the T sign and walks straight to their drinks break huddle. 11.33am BST 96th over: Australia 378-5 (Smith 120, Carey 0) Umesh Yadav on to bowl one over before drinks. Better than his start yesterday, it only yields a dashed single for Smith and a leg bye from Carey. Updated at 11.34am BST 11.24am BST 95th over: Australia 376-5 (Smith 119, Carey 0) Shami to the left-handed Carey, working in the channel outside off stump immediately. Smashed on the pad last ball of the over, but high, maybe some bat in there? Hard to tell, it bounced up towards point a long way. 11.18am BST WICKET! Green c Gill b Shami 6, Australia 376 for 5 There’s one for India! Green looked good for a minute but he aims a hard-handed drive at a ball that’s not full enough for it. Looking to force that more than drive it, not fully forward. Shami gets enough from the pitch to take the edge and it flies to first slip, nearly taking Gill with it to the boundary. He manages to cling on while he falls. 11.16am BST 94th over: Australia 368-4 (Smith 119, Green 6) Siraj will be frustrated. Draws an edge from Smith, but it’s thick and low, flying square through the finer part of the gully area for four. Siraj follows up by revisiting his early sins, full on the pads and Smith clips him for another boundary. 11.09am BST 93rd over: Australia 368-4 (Smith 111, Green 6) So Travis Head’s career batting average is up to 47.62. The partnership was 285, which is 29th on Australia’s all-time partnership list. 11.05am BST 92nd over: Australia 367-4 (Smith 110, Green 6) Cameron Green to the middle for his first hit in England, and he smokes his first ball for four! Width, enough to smash a square drive behind point. Then takes two more through square. Comfortable start. Another bouncer goes way over the batter’s head, again waved through by the umpire. 11.02am BST WICKET! Head c Bharat b Siraj 163, Australia 361-4 There it is! Relief for India. Head isn’t really a bunker-down-and-go-again kind of player, so he keeps throwing the bat at everything. This time it’s a ball down the leg side as he’s stepping across to off. Middling length, about hip high. Gets a glove on it to the keeper. Srikar Bharat with the ball in his mitt after catching out Travis Head. Cricket - ICC World Test Championship Final - Australia v India - The Oval, London, Britain - June 8, 2023 India's Mohammed Siraj celebrates after taking the wicket of Australia's Travis Head Action Images via Reuters/Paul Childs Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/Reuters Updated at 11.28am BST 10.58am BST 91st over: Australia 361-3 (Smith 110, Head 163) Shami tries the short ball from the far end, and Head whacks that for four. Then another pull to fine leg for a single. Pitches up at the end of the over and Smith drives that through cover for four! Hasn’t played much on the off side in this innings but he gets the width there to open his hands. 10.55am BST 90th over: Australia 351-3 (Smith 106, Head 158) Suddenly some life from Siraj! Gets his length right with the short ball, savagely rising at head who fends it away desperately and gets lucky as it lands safely behind point. Two balls later, he miscues a pull shot into the leg side, landing in a gap between a couple of fielders. The ball in between those two, though, he pulls for four. Classic Travis Head sequence there. 10.49am BST 89th over: Australia 345-3 (Smith 105, Head 153) The first boundary of the day for Head, leaning back and placing his cut shot behind point from Shami. He gives a modest wave and nothing more for the applause greeting his 150 – quite right, Travis, it is a nonsense milestone. Get a double ton and salute that. He tries a similar shot next ball and gets one more run. Smith glances another. 10.45am BST 88th over: Australia 338-3 (Smith 104, Head 148) Siraj works away, and after that early flurry Smith goes back into his defensive mode from yesterday. The only run is a wide from a high bouncer. India’s quicks really have not got the length on this pitch, most of the short balls yesterday went sailing over. And the umpires ignored most of those yesterday, but this one is called today. 10.42am BST 87th over: Australia 338-3 (Smith 104, Head 148) Mohammed Shami on from the Vauxhall End, and hitting a decent length. Both players bat sensibly, with a couple of singles, until Head swishes at the last ball of the over and misses. 10.36am BST CENTURY! Steve Smith 103 from 229 balls 86th over: Australia 336-3 (Smith 103, Head 147) Well that doesn’t take long! Travis Head rides the bounce of the first ball of the day, dropping it to the leg side for a run. Then Siraj bowls two offerings on the pads, and Smith flicks them both away through the leg side for four! He goes from 95 to 103 in the blink of an eye, and has no sooner started his day than he’s lifting his arms to the crowd in salute, kissing the badge and all that stuff, celebrating Test century #31 in his personal collection. That’s one every 3.12 matches across his career. Steve Smith knocks a four to bring up his century. Photograph: Steven Paston/PA Updated at 10.45am BST 10.30am BST The players are in the middle, we are ready to go. 10.16am BST Lovely day here at The Oval, the forecast was spot on so far. Not a cloud visible about quarter of an hour before play. Pleasant sunshine but not hot. If you want to come down there might be seats available in the Pavilion. They only got around to releasing those publicly a few days ago, given the Surrey members hadn’t shown much interest. So it was largely empty in that one stand yesterday. This being the ICC + cricket in England, those tickets are probably punishingly expensive if they are available. Let me know if you’ve been scoping it out, enquiring minds want to know. 10.08am BST Want to know about Travis Head reaching new heights before a lot of people have realised that he’s quite that good?

It is time for the World Test Championship final to enter its second phase, on a day that the Australians will be looking forward to rather more than what is probably a sore and irritable Indian team. India were in the game yesterday after some fierce bowling at the start, but then Travis Head did the Travis Head trick, which is to make a million runs at a million miles an hour. He’s resuming on 156 not out, Steve Smith on 95 not out, and they could race up the list of Australian partnerships with 251 already between them. Commentary statement of the obvious: India need all of the wickets in none of the time, and it’s supposed to be a sunny day in London with temperatures in the low 20s. That’s right: officially a Batting Day.

After five minutes, they had drifted out about 75 metres from the beach and the friend in the kayak tried unsuccessfully to push them back to shore. The coastguard was called when the inflatable was 200 metres offshore. A member of the public went out to the duck on a paddleboard to try to save the men. Struggling against the current, the man managed to tow the inflatable closer to shore, where the men all jumped out and swam to the beach. The inflatable was immediately blown back out to sea. Volunteers from Appledore Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) were out in their inshore and all-weather lifeboats on a routine training exercise when they were tasked by the coastguard to assist the men. The inshore lifeboat arrived as the men made it back to shore safely, with crew member Del Elsemore swimming in to check on them. Elsemore said: “The quick thinking of this member of the public with a paddleboard prevented a nasty situation turning much worse. He was the real lifesaver of the day.” The lifeboats returned to their exercise after the incident on 6 June, complete with Quackers on board. A spokesperson for the rescue charity said: “With the strong tides and offshore breezes of the Bristol Channel, Appledore RNLI urges people never to take an inflatable toy into the sea. “There is no way to control these and they get pulled out from shore within seconds. If any member of the public sees someone getting into difficulty in the water, please, as this eyewitness did, call 999 and ask for the coastguard.” The incident comes as the Royal Life Saving Society (RLSS) has warned of the risks of open water as there are more drownings during heat waves than at any other time of year. Lee Heard, the director of the RLSS, said: “Devastatingly over the recent weeks we have seen a number of people, including many children, lose their lives when in or near the water. There is evidence that there is a link between warmer weather and increased number of accidental drownings, and we want to ensure that everyone is equipped with the vital knowledge to allow them to safely enjoy being in or around the water.” In 2022, 46% of the 226 accidental drownings took place in June, July and August, according to official figures, including the drowning deaths of seven teenage boys during the July heatwave.","Id":"uk-news/2023/jun/08/three-rescued-after-inflatable-duck-drifts-out-to-sea-off-devon-coast","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"Three rescued after inflatable duck drifts out to sea off Devon coast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/08/three-rescued-after-inflatable-duck-drifts-out-to-sea-off-devon-coast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/jun/08/three-rescued-after-inflatable-duck-drifts-out-to-sea-off-devon-coast","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":458,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T13:23:36Z","id":"uk-news/2023/jun/08/three-rescued-after-inflatable-duck-drifts-out-to-sea-off-devon-coast","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Zelenskiy visits Kherson as Red Cross warns dam floodwater uprooting and dispersing mines","body":"2.06pm BST Speaking of the Russian defence minister, our central and eastern Europe correspondent Shaun Walker has this report: The investigations team of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has released a new video in which it claims to have found a son of Russia’s defence minister Sergei Shoigu, whose name was previously not known to the public. Over the past year, Shoigu’s alleged son has been making cheesy pop songs in English while his father is sending tens of thousands of Russians to war in Ukraine. Previously, Shoigu was known to have two daughters, but Navalny’s team say the defence minister had a secret second family in the early 2000s, and obtained documents it claimed showed his mistress had received a vast, lavish property despite a modest official salary. Navalny’s team claimed 22-year-old Danila Shebunov was one of three children from Shoigu’s second, secret, relationship, and said he also owned prime real estate in central Moscow. These properties allegedly bring Shebunov a sizeable income from rent, and were allegedly obtained thanks to his father’s connections. Shebunov, who goes by the name Sheba Singer, has a rich social media presence, although few followers, and recently has produced a steady output of pop songs and lifestyle videos, usually in English and often involving him undressing. Maria Pevchikh of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, who presented the video investigation, asked ironically why it was that Shebunov was producing this kind of output rather than suffering in a trench in Ukraine along with thousands of Russian soldiers his age. Это приманка, чтобы вы прямо сейчас пошли смотреть расследование про сына Шойгу. Разбираемся, чем занимается элитный сынуля во время войны https://t.co/0ngqeG1VhS pic.twitter.com/ovgrWBxAz0 — Maria Pevchikh (@pevchikh) June 8, 2023 For years, Navalny’s team has made videos it says expose corruption and hypocrisy in Putin’s elite. The latest video, 19 minutes long, had clocked up more than 100,000 views on YouTube within an hour of being posted. Neither Shoigu nor Shebunov have yet commented on the video. Updated at 2.22pm BST 1.59pm BST The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said on Thursday that his forces had repelled overnight attempts by Ukrainian forces to break through the frontline in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, Russia’s RIA news agency reported. Shoigu was cited by the Interfax news agency as saying that four separate Ukrainian attacks along the front had been halted and that Kyiv’s forces had been forced to retreat “with heavy losses”. These claims have not been independently verified. Updated at 2.05pm BST 1.41pm BST At least three people were wounded in Russian shelling of the Ukrainian city of Kherson on Thursday as people were being evacuated because of flooding caused by the collapse of the nearby Kakhovka dam, police said. Ukraine’s interior ministry said in a statement: The shelling began precisely during the evacuation of citizens whose homes were flooded. It reiterated accusations that Russia had abandoned people in territory it occupied in the Kherson region, adding: And it continues to prevent Ukraine from saving the most valuable – human lives. Updated at 1.55pm BST 1.30pm BST The Russian embassy has said the responsibility for the “unfolding tragedy” in Kherson due to the destruction of the Kakhovka dam lies with Kyiv and western countries who have supplied Ukraine with weapons, in what they describe as a “terrorist plot”. In a statement, permanent representative Vassily Nebenzia at the UN security council (UNSC) briefing on the situation around the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant said: On the night of 5 June to 6 [June], the Kyiv regime committed an unthinkable crime. They blasted the dam of the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant, which resulted in an uncontrolled release of water downstream of the Dnipro River. Feeling its total impunity and being encouraged by western sponsors, the Kyiv regime decided to fulfil this terrorist plot this time. The responsibility for this unfolding tragedy fully rests with the Kyiv regime and its western masters who pump up Ukraine with weapons. Updated at 1.38pm BST 1.14pm BST The water level at a reservoir in southern Ukraine is approaching a dangerous low after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, the state company overseeing the facility said on Thursday, which could affect the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. Moscow and Kyiv blamed one another for the collapse of the dam on Tuesday, which unleashed water from the Dnipro River into a wide area of the Kherson region, Reuters reports. Ihor Syrota, general director of the energy company Ukrhydroenergo, told Ukrainian television that a drop below the current water level at the Kakhovka reservoir could affect the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station and water supply to other regions. He said: We are reaching this dead zone, which is 12.70 (meters), after which there will be not be any water intake either for the cooling ponds at the Zaporizhzhia station … or. … for all regions.” Ukraine’s nuclear energy company said on Thursday the situation was “stable and under control” at the Zaporizhzhia plant on Thursday morning. Syrota added that Ukrhydroenergo was ready to work on an overlay across the damaged hydroelectric station and dam as soon as Russian forces left the eastern side of the Dnipro, and that it would take about two months to complete. 1.02pm BST Britain has announced a new sanctions package against Belarus on Thursday for its role in facilitating Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including import bans and new measures aimed at preventing internet propaganda. Belarus, led by president Alexander Lukashenko since 1994, is Russia’s staunchest ally among ex-Soviet states and allowed its territory to be used to launch the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Last month Russia moved ahead with a decision to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. James Cleverly, the British foreign secretary, said in a statement: This new package ratchets up the economic pressure on Lukashenko and his regime which actively facilitates the Russian war effort and ignores Ukraine’s territorial integrity. The new package includes banning the import of gold, cement, wood and rubber from Belarus and blocking exports to Belarus from Britain of banknotes and machinery, as well as goods, technologies and materials that could be used to produce chemical and biological weapons. Britain said it would also be able to prevent designated Belarusian media companies from “spreading propaganda in the UK” with social media companies and internet service providers restricting access to the websites of sanctioned Belarusian media organisations. 12.45pm BST Flooding caused by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine has forced Russian troops to retreat by distances of five to 15km (three to nine miles) in the Kherson region, a military spokesperson said. Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, told Ukrainian television the redeployment had “practically halved” Russian shelling in the region, Reuters reports. Russia has not yet commented. 12.14pm BST The Russian-installed governor of Ukraine’s Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, said on Thursday that Ukraine had shelled an evacuation point for civilians affected by the Kakhovka dam breach in the town of Hola Prystan, killing two people, Reuters reports. Updated at 12.18pm BST 11.49am BST The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region said in a statement posted on Telegram that two settlements in the region had been attacked by drones. Belgorod, which borders Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, has come under repeated attack from Kyiv’s forces in recent weeks. These claims have not been independently verified. More information to come … 11.45am BST The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked the staff at one of Kherson’s hospitals for their work in helping people affected by the explosion at the Nova Kakhovka dam during a visit. In a tweet, he described medics as “heroic people” and wished patients good health. У пункті евакуації на базі одного з медзакладів Херсона поспілкувався з нашими людьми, які постраждали внаслідок руйнування Каховської ГЕС. Ми допоможемо, і все, що треба відновити, ми відбудуємо. Дякую вам і бажаю здоров’я. Хочу подякувати всьому персоналу медзакладу за роботу… pic.twitter.com/8omzH8pVzy — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) June 8, 2023 11.34am BST The Kremlin on Thursday accused Ukraine of shelling Russian rescue workers in the area flooded after the huge Kakhovka dam in Ukraine’s Kherson region was breached earlier this week. It did not provide any immediate evidence for its assertion. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also said that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, did not currently have any plans to visit the disaster area. Updated at 12.14pm BST 11.23am BST Here are some more images that have been sent to us over the news wires, showing the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, visiting people at a hospital that is being used as one of Kherson’s evacuation points.

Photograph: Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 11.35am BST 11.03am BST Summary of the day so far … Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited the Kherson region that has been impacted by flooding after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. In a post to Telegram, Ukraine’s president said the main issues discussed during the visit were “the operational situation in the region as a result of the disaster, evacuation of the population from potential flood zones, elimination of the emergency caused by the dam explosion, organisation of life support for the flooded areas”. In an address on Wednesday evening, Zelenskiy said it was impossible to predict how many people would die in Russian-occupied parts of Kherson due to the flooding, urging a “clear and rapid reaction from the world” to support victims. He also severely criticised the UN and the Red Cross who he said were not helping the relief effort. “Our military and special services are rescuing people as much as it is possible, despite the shelling. But large-scale efforts are needed,” he said. “We need international organisations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of Kherson region. About 230 square miles (600 sq km) of the Kherson region was under water on Thursday, the regional governor said. Oleksandr Prokudin said 68% of the flooded territory was on the Russian-occupied left bank of the Dnipro River. The average level of flooding in the Kherson region on Thursday morning was 5.61m (18.41ft), he said. He said almost 2,000 people had left flooded territory as of Thursday morning. Five people have died due to flooding after the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station according to the Russian-imposed mayor of occupied Nova Kakhovka, the nearest settlement to the dam. Russian media has claimed that over 14,000 houses were flooded, and almost 4,300 people were evacuated in occupied Kherson, but the claims have not been independently verified. Volodymyr Litvinov, the head of the Beryslav district administration in Kherson region, reported that there was a risk of flooding further inland, due to rising level of the Inhulets River, which feeds into the Dnipro. The International Atomic Energy Agency has announced that it will strengthen its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant amid concerns over water supplies for cooling the plant’s reactors. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reported that “missiles flew over Luhansk, several explosions were heard in the city”. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, has issued a new statement about the situation with shelters in Ukraine’s capital, saying that the city’s council will warn the owners of private premises with shelters that if they are not properly maintained, or people are not admitted during an air raid, these premises may be seized from them. It follows the deaths last week of three people who were unable to get into a locked shelter and were then hit by falling debris from a Russian missile attack. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, had a telephone call with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, during which he briefed Putin on the forthcoming African leaders’ peace mission to Russia and Ukraine, the South African presidency said. The US president, Joe Biden, is to welcome the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, for wide-ranging talks on Thursday as the British leader makes his first White House visit as premier. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the 15-Russian invasion of Ukraine would be “top of mind”. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Mabel Banfield-Nwachi will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Updated at 11.07am BST 10.49am BST Russian Industry and Trade minister Denis Manturov said on Thursday that Moscow has no access to the damaged part of the Togliatti-Odesa ammonia pipeline, and does not expect to be granted it, the Interfax news agency reported. Russia has made the restart of the pipeline, which before the war carried ammonia from Russia to Ukraine for export, central to future renewal of a deal allowing Ukraine to export its grain safely from its Black Sea ports. Reuters reports that both Russia and Ukraine this week claimed there was damage to a section of the pipeline that runs through the frontline between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. The two sides have blamed each other. 10.45am BST The water level in the North Crimean Canal, which carries water from the Kakhovka reservoir behind the breached Kakhovka dam to the Crimean peninsula, remains stable, Reuters reports the Russian-imposed governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said on Thursday. Crimea relies heavily on water transported by the canal. After Moscow seized the peninsula in 2014, claiming to have annexed it, Kyiv blocked the canal. 10.32am BST Dam floodwater uprooting and dispersing mines, Red Cross warns Mines uprooted and dispersed by floodwaters surging downstream from the breached Kakhovka dam across swathes of southern Ukraine could pose a grave danger to civilians for decades to come, the Red Cross said. “In the past we knew where the hazards were. Now we don’t know. All we know is that they are somewhere downstream,” said Erik Tollefsen, head of the Weapon Contamination Unit at the International Committee of the Red Cross. “It is with a certain horror that we look at the news coming out,” Reuters reports Tollefsen said in an audio clip, adding that the second world war mines found underwater in Denmark in 2015 were still active. Besides anti-personnel mines, both sides have used vast amounts of artillery shells and anti-tank mines. The exact number of mines in Ukraine is unclear, said Tollefsen. “We just know the numbers are massive,” said Tollefsen. Tollefsen said the issue with mines was not necessarily the nominal number of mines but where they were laid – especially in a heavily agricultural country such as Ukraine. Updated at 10.56am BST 9.56am BST Here are some of the first images to be released of Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kherson.

He has posted to Telegram: In connection with the explosion of the Kakhovskaya HPP dam, there was an uncontrolled flow of water from the Dnipro River downstream. There is a rise in the water level in the Inhulets River, which flows into the Dnipro. Listing several villages near Kalynivske, which is about 22 miles (35km) from the Dnipro, Litvinov warned: “Due to the flooding of the bridge, it is not possible to travel to the village of Zapovit. The water is getting close to the homes of residents.” Updated at 10.19am BST 9.43am BST Here are some images that have been sent to us over the news wires from occupied Ukraine, showing the impact of flooding in Nova Kakhovka, where the local Russian-imposed official has said five people have died.

Three people are known to have died on the Ukraine-controlled bank of the Dnipro River, while occupying authorities on the left-bank have said at least five people were killed. Ukraine’s regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, has said about 230 sq miles (600 sq km) of the region is under water, and that Ukraine has so far evacuated almost 2,000 people. In a post to Telegram, Ukraine’s president wrote: Working trip to Kherson region. A coordination meeting on the liquidation of consequences of the Kakhovka HPP dam explosion. Many important issues were discussed. The operational situation in the region as a result of the disaster, evacuation of the population from potential flood zones, elimination of the emergency caused by the dam explosion, organization of life support for the flooded areas. Also, the prospects for restoring the region’s ecosystem and the operational military situation in the man-made disaster area. It is important to calculate the damage and allocate funds to compensate residents affected by the disaster and develop a programme to compensate for losses or relocate businesses within the Kherson region.

He has been under pressure after people were killed when they were unable to get into a shelter. On Telegram, Klitschko wrote: Today, the Kyiv city council has to adopt a comprehensive draft decision concerning shelters. In particular, to warn the owners of private premises that if they are not properly maintained or people are not admitted during the air raid, these premises may be seized from them. Updated at 9.13am BST 8.53am BST About 230 square miles (600 sq km) of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine was under water on Thursday after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka hydroelectric dam, the regional governor said. Oleksandr Prokudin said 68% of the flooded territory was on the Russian-occupied left bank of the Dnipro River. The average level of flooding in the Kherson region on Thursday morning was 5.61m (18.41ft), he said. “We’re already working. We will help everyone that has ended up in trouble,” Reuters reports he said in a video statement of the flooding, caused by the collapse of the dam. “Despite the immense danger and constant Russian shelling, evacuation from zones of flooding is continuing,” Prokudin said. He said almost 2,000 people had left flooded territory as of Thursday morning. Russian media reports that almost 4,300 people have been evacuated in the occupied area of Kherson. The claims have not been independently verified.

Photograph: Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters Updated at 7.47am BST 7.12am BST Our First Edition morning newsletter today features my colleague Esther Addley talking to our defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh, who is in Kherson. Here is an extract: “This is a huge crisis,” said Dan Sabbagh, adding that there is “something elemental” about the scale of the flooding. “It’s just a massive river. We don’t know where the river boundary will end up. We don’t know what the new landscape will look like.” The water was still rising, though more slowly than before, when Dan spoke to me yesterday from central Kherson. He was standing at a crossroads that ordinarily would be hundreds of metres from the riverbank; instead, he said, the kerb had become “quite a busy little port” as rescue boats came and went. For eight months last year, Kherson was occupied by Russian forces; parts of it have been heavily damaged by shelling and many people had already left the city by the time the floods hit. “Younger people tend to get out as fast as they can,” said Dan. “The residents who have stayed on are mostly older, and have point blank refused to go.” For many of those who remained, though, the flooding has forced them out of the homes they resolutely refused to quit. As we spoke, Dan described an inflatable dinghy arriving, carrying a woman in her 70s and an older man who was unable to walk, who had been rescued along with “the obligatory dog”. A basket of five brown cats had been brought in a little earlier; in the background a dog was barking. “There are a lot of abandoned pets – you see them everywhere. It’s just a feature of a war zone.” A volunteer evacuates a dog by boat from a flooded neighborhood in Kherson.

Stoltenberg is slated to meet with Biden in Washington on Monday, and leaders from the alliance are set to gather in Lithuania on 11-12 July for their annual summit. 6.29am BST Ukraine to be 'top of mind' when Biden and Sunak meet President Joe Biden is welcoming Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for wide-ranging talks on Thursday as the British leader makes his first White House visit as premier. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the 15-month-old Russian invasion of Ukraine will be “top of mind”, the Associated Press reports. The US and UK are the two biggest donors to the Ukraine war effort and play a central role in a long-term effort announced last month to train, and eventually equip, Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets. “The two leaders will review a range of global issues including our economic partnership or shared support of Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s war of aggression, as well as further action to accelerate the clean energy transition,” Jean-Pierre said. “The president and the prime minister will also discuss the joint US-UK leadership on critical emerging technologies as well as our work to strengthen our economic security.” Updated at 10.44am BST 6.16am BST In an address on Wednesday evening, Zelenskiy said it was impossible to predict how many people would die in Russian-occupied parts of Kherson due to the flooding, urging a “clear and rapid reaction from the world” to support victims.

It quoted Director General Grossi as saying, “The possible loss of the plant’s main source of cooling water further complicates an already extremely difficult and challenging nuclear safety and security situation”.

Photograph: Andriy Andriyenko/AP The update outlines threats to the water supply for ponds that feed cool the plant’s nuclear reactors. The agency said that it was working to ensure that there was as much cooling water in reserve as possible in the event that it could no longer access the Kakhovka reservoir. The reservoir’s water levels were continuing to drop, the agency said. It explained that the reservoir’s water levels had already fallen by 2.8 metres since Tuesday, but that the hourly rate of loss had slowed to “ between 5 and 7 centimetres per hour from a peak of around 11 cm/hour yesterday”. “If the level falls below 12.7 metres, the ZNPP will no longer be able to pump water from the reservoir to the site.” it said, adding that this level could be reached in two days. “Preparing for such a possibility, the ZNPP is continuously replenishing its water reserves – including the large cooling pond next to the plant as well as its smaller sprinkler cooling ponds and the adjacent channels – by fully utilising the water of the Kakhovka reservoir while this still remains possible.” 5.48am BST Three die in flooding Three people have died as a result of flooding from the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine, local media have reported, in what would be the first confirmed deaths, as President Volodymyr Zelenskiy voiced fears for the lives of Ukrainians in Russian-held areas hit by the disaster. Citing the exiled mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Oleshky, Yevhen Ryshchuk, the Kyiv Independent reported that “three people drowned” in the Kherson region. Related: Kakhovka dam: first flooding deaths reported as Ukraine criticises global aid response Updated at 5.57am BST 5.40am BST Opening summary Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. At least three people have been confirmed dead as a result of flooding from the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, Ukrainian media outlets reported on Wednesday, citing the exiled mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Oleshky in Kherson region. And the International Atomic Energy Agency has announced that it will strengthen its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear energy plant amid concerns over water supplies for cooling the plant’s reactors. More on these stories shortly. Here are the other key recent developments: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address that it was impossible to predict how many people would die in Russian-occupied areas due to the flooding, urging a “clear and rapid reaction from the world” to support victims. “The situation in occupied parts of the Kherson region is absolutely catastrophic. The occupiers are simply abandoning people in frightful conditions. No help, without water, left on the roofs of houses in submerged communities,” he said. “If an international organisation is not present in the disaster zone, it means it does not exist at all or is incapable.” Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have been left “without normal access to drinking water” after the destruction, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned. The Ukrainian leader said the evacuation of people and the urgent provision of drinking water were top priorities. The World Bank will support Ukraine by conducting a rapid assessment of damages and needs, a top bank official said on Wednesday. Anna Bjerde, the World Bank’s managing director for operations, said the destruction of the Novo Kakhovka dam had “many very serious consequences for essential service delivery and the broader environment.” Drone footage showed roads and buildings in Kherson completely submerged by flood water. The critical dam, which lies along the Dnipro River in Ukraine’s Kherson region – now held by Russia – collapsed on Tuesday, flooding a swathe of the war’s frontline. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, told Putin in a phone call on Wednesday that a comprehensive investigation was needed into the destruction of the dam. Erdoğan told Putin that an international commission that includes the UN and Turkey could be formed to look into the issue, a statement from the Turkish president’s office said. Britain cannot yet say Russia is responsible for the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, prime minister Rishi Sunak said on Wednesday. Asked during a visit to the US whether Russia was responsible, Sunak said: “I can’t say that definitively yet” but that “if true it will represent a new low. It’s an appalling act of barbarism on Russia’s part.” The US “cannot say conclusively” who was responsible for the destruction of the dam, national security council spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday. “We’re doing the best we can to assess”, he told reporters at the White House, noting “destruction of civilian infrastructure is not allowed by the laws of war”. France will send aid to Ukraine “to meet immediate needs” after the destruction of the dam, President Emmanuel Macron has said. Macron said he expressed solidarity with the people of Ukraine in the aftermath of what he described as an “atrocious act which is endangering populations”. A top Moscow-backed official in a part of Ukraine controlled by Russia has said that the collapse of the dam has handed the Russian military a tactical advantage. Vladimir Saldo said he believed Kyiv was to blame for the disaster but that the dam’s destruction and resulting flood waters would make it easier for Russia to defend against any Ukrainian counter-offensive in the area. Relief workers on the Ukraine-controlled right bank of the river have reported having to work under fire. The UN’s humanitarian aid agency warned the disaster “will likely get worse in the coming hours”, with access to drinking water and health risks associated with contaminated water among the most pressing concerns. Ukraine has not yet launched a planned counteroffensive to win back territory occupied by Russia, a senior Ukrainian security official said on Wednesday. Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, dismissed statements by Russian officials who have said the counteroffensive has already begun, adding that its start will be obvious to everyone when it happens. Russia’s defence ministry has said “Ukrainian saboteurs” had blown up a section of the Togliatti-Odesa ammonia pipeline on Monday, which carries fertiliser from Russia to Ukraine in Kharkiv region. There was no immediate comment on the allegations from Ukraine. A group of Nato countries may be willing to put troops on the ground in Ukraine if member states do not provide tangible security guarantees to Kyiv at the alliances’s summit in Vilnius, the former Nato secretary general Anders Rasmussen has said. Current Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance must discuss options for giving Ukraine security assurances for the time after its war with Russia.","Id":"world/live/2023/jun/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-first-kherson-dam-flooding-deaths-un-nuclear-watchdog-to-strengthen-presence-at-zaporizhzhia-plant","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Zelenskiy visits Kherson as Red Cross warns dam floodwater uprooting and dispersing mines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-first-kherson-dam-flooding-deaths-un-nuclear-watchdog-to-strengthen-presence-at-zaporizhzhia-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jun/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-first-kherson-dam-flooding-deaths-un-nuclear-watchdog-to-strengthen-presence-at-zaporizhzhia-plant","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":5318,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T13:22:29Z","id":"world/live/2023/jun/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-first-kherson-dam-flooding-deaths-un-nuclear-watchdog-to-strengthen-presence-at-zaporizhzhia-plant","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"French Open 2023 semi-final: Karolina Muchova v Aryna Sabalenka – live","body":"2.21pm BST Muchova 1-2 Sabalenka* Muchova gets to 30-all and in the circumstances this is a chance. Muchova, as we thought she might, slows down the pace of things, forcing Sabalenka to generate her own power – if she wants to. Which she doesn’t – instead she comes in slices a gorgeous drop, then on game-point monsters consecutive forehands, illustrating the conundrum of facing her perfectly: how do you beat someone who can hit it harder than you, who also has a better touch than you? 2.18pm BST Muchova* 1-1 Sabalenka A solid start from Muchova,b ut then at 40-15 Sabalenka runs in and from mid-court slices a lovely backhand winner cross-court to the forehand corner. She’s playing with almost indecent confidence, but when she spanks a forehand from the back it drops fractionally long and Muchova is on the board. Meantime, Chrissy notes that Saba is kinder to herself now, allowing points she doesn’t win to pass without chastising her behaviour. On which point, to learn how to practise self-compassion – and other helpful behaviours – check out the work of Dr Shefali Tsabary. 2.12pm BST Muchova 0-1 Sabalenka* (*denotes server) I love the simplicity of Sabalenka’s serve – there’s so little movement, it’s just toss, set, bend, whack. She starts nicely too, a big topspin forehand winner giving her 40-15 and the game sealed with an ace. Aryna Sabalenka holds in the first game of the semi-final. Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters Updated at 2.18pm BST 2.09pm BST And … play. 2.09pm BST Absolute sake dept: Chatrier, though buzzing, is a long way off full. What is wrong with people? 2.08pm BST Sabalenka goes to No1 in the world if she wins the competition or if Swiatek loses today. She’s yet to lose a set in the competition, and her last two wins, over Sloane Stephens and Elina Svitolina, were extremely impressive. 2.06pm BST As I alluded to earlier, Muchova recently had seven months off with an abdominal injury, so being out there now must be gravy – Hawksmoor’s bone marrow gravy, no less. 2.04pm BST Muchova wins the toss and, as per the present vogue, opts to receive. The idea is, I imagine, to put an opponent under pressure while settling oneself. 2.03pm BST The wind’s kicking up a little which might help Muchova – she’ll be looking for points of difference – but on the other hand it might help Sabalenka, who can hit either with it or through it. 2.01pm BST Here come our players! Updated at 2.05pm BST 2.01pm BST What I will say is that there’s more chance Muchova beats Sabalenka than Haddad Maia beats Swiatek, partly because Sabalenka is still Sabalenka – her new-found confidence isn’t yet fully entrenched – but also because Muchova has more to offer that might cause trouble. Haddad Maia has nice hands and serious power, I just don’t think she’s enough of either to see off Swiatek. 1.54pm BST Watching a further interview with Muchova, she won’t share her tactics but does seem to fancy herself. My guess is she tries to keep Sabalenka moving so that she can’t plant her feet and whack, which’ll mean drops, lobs, balls to the corners and variations of pace, spin and angle. 1.52pm BST Wow.

And welcome to Roland-Garros 2023 – day 12! I like these calm little moments before the storm. It reminds me of Beethoven. Can you hear it? It’s like, when you put your head to the grass. You can hear it growing. You can hear the insects, bzzzz ... Do you like Beethoven? So said Norman Stansfield in Léon and, though he wasn’t talking about our women’s semi-final matches – probably – he might’ve been. Because on the face of things, there’s no tension here as we know exactly what’s going to happen: Aryna Sabaklenka blazes through Karolína Muchová and Iga Swiatek devastates Beatriz Haddad Maia – the kind of light work best soundtracked by Mozart – then the two winners convene on Saturday for an absolute Brahms of a final. But sport – and women’s tennis in particular – tend not to work that way. After a miserable time with injury, Muchová will feel that her time is now, and knows that not long ago, Sabalenka was a fragile thwacker liable to falter under pressure. If she plays to her maximum, she’ll fancy her chances of reminding her reborn opponent exactly who she used used to be. Haddad Maia is a not dissimilar tigela de moqueca, a powerful hitter with hands and belief at her physical peak. It’s difficult to discomfit Swiatek, especially on clay, but the Brazilian is here because she’s hit purple patches in each of her last two matches, and she can find that level today, she’s a problem. Most likely, of course, the favourites do enough – though neither has been seriously tested in reaching this stage. Swiatek, the defending champion, the reigning US Open champion and the world No 1, is a generational talent with disquieting equanimity and no weaknesses. Real talk, she seems impregnable on clay … except Sabalenka is in majestically murderous form, assaulting the ball like it just called her mum a rude word and fortified, since winning the Australian Open, with all the confidence that eluded her in the years prior to that. Or, put another way, this going to be good … and what comes next might be even better. On y va!

Commenting on the figures, Patricia Marquis, the RCN’s director for England, said: Despite the prime minister saying cutting waiting lists is one of his top priorities, waiting times continue to head in the wrong direction and reflect a health and care system in crisis. Nursing staff are working around the clock to get to those waiting for the care they need. But with tens of thousands of vacancies, waiting times will not get shorter until the government addresses this and invests in the staff who have been neglected for too long. This has to start with paying nursing staff fairly. Updated at 2.11pm BST 1.47pm BST Biden backs proposal to hold summit in UK on regulating AI later this year, says Sunak President Biden has agreed to support a planned summit in the UK this autumn on ways to regulate artificial intelligence, Rishi Sunak has said on the second and final day of his trip to Washington DC. Speaking to Sky News outside Blair House, the presidential guest residence, before a meeting with US business leaders, after which he will head to the White House for talks with Biden, the prime minister confirmed what officials had been strongly hinting – that Biden is on board with the idea. “I’ll be discussing that with President Biden today. I’m delighted the US is supporting our summit,” he said, while being noncommittal about the wider idea of a UK-based global regulator for AI. He went on: I think that we need to start the conversation about what the type of regulation we need is, the form that will take is the type of topic one would hope we can discuss. Elsewhere, the interview was mainly notable for the way it almost exactly mimicked the other four or five TV chats Sunak has done so far on the trip – either dodging questions or giving carefully-worded answers, very often using the same precise phrases in each. Sunak’s fairly polished, managerial style sometimes masks the fact that when he speaks to the media, he has a very Theresa May-style tendency to roboticism. This trait has arguably been emphasised all the more on a ceremony-heavy but news-light trip in which there has been little novel to explain. Updated at 2.02pm BST 1.32pm BST The Liberal Democrats say Rishi Sunak should put Boris Johnson’s honours list (see 1.13pm) “through the shedder”. In a statement Daisy Cooper, the deputy Lib Dem leader, said: The fact that one of the most scandal-ridden prime ministers is now allowed to stuff his cronies in the Lords after a failed premiership tells the British public everything they need to know about this Conservative party. Boris Johnson caused crisis after crisis in this country - if Rishi Sunak rewards his failure it’s just proof it is one rule for the Conservatives and another for everyone else.

He went on: The Conservative party is, as ever, talking about the Conservative party and how they appease different bits of their own party. Whether it’s Boris Johnson’s WhatsApp messages, Boris Johnson’s peerages, all the prime minister is doing is managing his own party instead of running the country. Starmer said that anyone concerned about the cost of living is “going to see a government that is putting a party first, not country first”. (To be fair to Sunak, although party management is a preoccupation for him, and constrains his political choices, it is not something he actually talks about much in public. He has said almost nothing on the record about Johnson’s honours list.) Keir Starmer speaking to media during a visit to the British Steel in Scunthorpe today.

Updated at 1.04pm BST 12.36pm BST Cancer waiting times in England getting worse, NHS figures show Cancer waiting times across the NHS in England have got worse, PA Media reports. In an updated report on the NHS England performance figures published today (see 9.58am), PA says: Figures from NHS England show 61.0% of cancer patients who had their first treatment in April after an urgent GP referral had waited less than two months for treatment to start. This is down from 63.5% in March. The target is 85%. Meanwhile, the proportion of cancer patients who saw a specialist within two weeks of being referred urgently by their GP fell from 83.9% in March to 77.7% in April, remaining below the 93% target and the lowest figure since September 2022. The 93% target was last hit in May 2020, during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. Elsewhere, 71.3% of patients urgently referred for suspected cancer were diagnosed or had cancer ruled out within 28 days, down from 74.2% the previous month. The NHS elective recovery plan sets a goal of March 2024 for 75% of patients who have been urgently referred by their GP for suspected cancer to be diagnosed or have cancer ruled out within 28 days. Overall, some 218,060 urgent cancer referrals were made by GPs in England in April, down month-on-month (by 16% compared with March 2023) but up year-on-year (by 2% compared with April 2022). Seven per cent more people were referred for urgent cancer checks in the year to April, though the data shows they are having to wait longer to be seen or treated. Today’s figures came out as the Royal College of Radiologists said cancer patients are facing life-threatening hospital delays and the prospect of more gruelling treatment as a result of NHS staff shortages.

(See 10.47am.) Asked to explain what reforms to party funding laws it is still pushing for, a spokesperson said: We have recommended since 2018 that the UK government and parliament should consider the need for stronger controls on donations and loans to political parties and campaigners to help protect parties from those who seek to evade the law, and give voters confidence in our political finance system. This would include additional duties for regulated entities, including political parties and campaigners, to check the true source of donations and assess the risk of accepting donations including from overseas. It would help strengthen the regime, protect elections from unlawful influence and improve transparency for voters.

The plans have been drawn up following concerns that MPs accused of serious sexual offences, including rape, have been allowed to continue working in parliament. But, as Eleni Courea writes in her Politico London Playbook briefing, the proposals are controversial. She says: Last night the government was debating whether to hold a vote on Monday on proposals to ban MPs accused of violent or sexual offences from the estate — after backlash from some Tory backbenchers. One senior Tory MP told Playbook they opposed the plan because it would overturn “common practice that you are innocent until proven guilty”. In her statement on next week’s Commons business, Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, said there would be “a general debate on risk-based exclusion of members of parliament” on Monday next week, after debates on the retained EU law (revocation and reform) bill and on some Public Order Act regulations. But Mordaunt did not say that MPs would be asked to vote on the proposed changes to the rules next week.

That compares with almost £13m donated in the first quarter of 2022. In a statement issued alongside the new figures, Louise Edwards, the commission’s director of regulation and digital transformation, said: We publish details of these donations so that voters understand how political parties are funded. We know transparency of party and campaigner finance is important for people, but our research tells us that only 24% of people believe party funding is transparent. It’s clear that publishing this information is not enough. We continue to recommend to the UK government that it reforms the system, to help protect parties from those who seek to evade the law, and give voters more confidence. The figures show that the Conservatives received £12.1m in the first three months of this year, Labour £4.4m (including £2m from Lord Sainsbury), the Liberal Democrats £1.3m and the SNP just £4,000. Earlier this year the government rejected opposition attempts to amend the national security bill to require political parties to produce statements saying what they are doing to ensure they are not taking money from foreign powers. Under current law, parties are not allowed to take money from foreign companies or governments. But there have been calls for the law to be tightened because companies based in the UK that donate to political parties do not have to show that that money was generated in the UK. Sir Julian Lewis, the Conservative chair of parliament’s intelligence and security committee, was one of the MPs who backed the amendment to the national security bill. But the government rejected it, arguing it was unnecessary. UPDATE: See 12.22pm for more details of the party funding reforms the commission is proposing. Updated at 12.31pm BST 9.58am BST Sunak still has not met target for ending 18-month hospital waits by April 2023, latest figures show NHS England has released new waiting time figures. PA Media has the main points. The number of people in England waiting to start routine hospital treatment has risen to a record high, PA reports. PA says: An estimated 7.4 million people were waiting to start treatment at the end of April, up from 7.3 million in March, NHS England said. It is the highest number since records began in August 2007. Rishi Sunak has made cutting waiting lists one of his priorities for 2023, pledging in January that “lists will fall and people will get the care they need more quickly”. Some 11,477 people are estimated to have been waiting more than 18 months to start routine hospital treatment at the end of April, NHS England said. PA says: This is up from 10,737 at the end of March. The government and NHS England set the ambition of eliminating all waits of more than 18 months by April of this year, excluding exceptionally complex cases or patients who choose to wait longer. A total of 371,111 people in England had been waiting more than 52 weeks to start routine hospital treatment at the end of April. PA says: This is up from 359,798 at the end of March. The government and NHS England have set the ambition of eliminating all waits of more than a year by March 2025. Some 218,060 urgent cancer referrals were made by GPs in England in April, down month-on-month (by 16% compared with March 2023) but up year-on-year (by 2% compared with April 2022). PA says: The proportion of cancer patients who saw a specialist within two weeks of being referred urgently by their GP fell from 83.9% in March to 77.7% in April, remaining below the 93% target and the lowest figure since September 2022. The 93% target was last hit in May 2020, during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. 9.40am BST The Labour MP Jess Phillips broke Commons rules by registering a payment from the University of Bristol two days late, a report from the Commons standards committee reveals today. Daniel Greenberg, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, launched an investigation after a member of the public complained that Phillips had not registered payment for an appearance on a TV show on 17 January 2020. Greenberg established that Phillips had not registered a payment because she had not been paid for the broadcast, but in the course of his inquiry he found that Phillips had registered a payment from the University of Bristol two days after the 28-day deadline. He said that, although this was a minor breach, he was reporting it to the Commons standards committee because it happened less than six months after Phillips corrected her failure to submit some other entries on time. Phillips told the commissioner that “administrative changes in her office” were to blame for the University of Bristol money being declared late. The standards committee said it was not recommending any further action. In comments that suggest the committee thinks that Greenberg might have been a tad over-zealous in this case, and that he did not need to produce a full report on Phillips (a “rectification” process is available which allows minor breaches to be resolved without a full report going to the standards committee), it said: We note the commissioner’s memorandum and are grateful to him for his diligence. This case underlines the need for members to submit their complete registrations in good time. Updated at 10.46am BST 9.19am BST Lucas says energy policies make Sunak's government more 'dangerous' than Just Stop Oil protesters And here are the best extracts from Caroline Lucas’s interview on the Today programme: Lucas said that she would not be “retiring with my knitting” after leaving the Commons, and that not being an MP would give her more time to focus on climate issues. She said: The thing that really motivates me, what really drives me, is action around the climate and nature emergencies. Over the course of my lifetime alone, populations and some of our most important wildlife have plummeted by over half. The climate crisis is accelerating, warnings we will crash through that 1.5C climate threshold within the next five years. So these are really massive issues. And because I have to be the frontbench spokesperson on everything for my party, I’m pulling so many directions, from benefits to Brexit, and it just means that I can’t give the time that I personally want to those big issues around climate and nature. She said climate activists were right to use direct action and she gave qualified support to the Just Stop Oil protests. Asked if she supported direct action by campaigners, she replied: I think there is a role for physical direct action and as you say - I always have done and I’ve done it myself. And when Nick Robinson put it to her that groups like Just Stop Oil were doing more to “energise” young people over the climate crisis than Green party politicians, Lucas replied: I think it’s a combination of both, to be honest. I think people who are taking peaceful, direct action, whether or not I agree with every single tactic, they have certainly accelerated the focus on this issue, mobilised huge numbers of people. But I think you also need people only on the inside of politics too. I just remember those words from António Guterres, the UN secretary general, where he said the truly dangerous radicals are not people who are protesting in the streets, it’s governments who aren’t facing up to the size of the emergency that we face and are still, for example in the case of our own government, licensing more oil and gas. That is what is truly dangerous and radical, not people who are quite understandably driven to take action on the streets because they are seeing that we are careering towards a cliff edge. She said Rishi Sunak’s government was more “dangerous and radical” than the Just Stop Oil protesters because of its energy policies. (See quote in the paragraph above.) Yesterday, Sunak described Just Stop Oil activists as “eco-zealots” who were “essentially leading us into an energy surrender”. She said she wanted to help the Green party get more people elected. Its performance in the local elections was its best ever, she said, and she said the Greens are now the largest party on 10 councils, and in administration in more than 30. Updated at 9.31am BST 8.59am BST Caroline Lucas says she is leaving parliament to devote more time to fighting ‘accelerating’ threats to planet Good morning. Tony Benn famously said, when he stood down as an MP, that he was leaving the House of Commons so that he would have “more time to devote to politics”. This morning Caroline Lucas, Britain’s first Green party MP, has in effect announced she is doing the same. More than 50 MPs have said they are standing down at the next election, but Lucas is one of the most significant figures on the list. Lucas’s election, as MP for Brighton Pavilion, was a major boost to the Green party (which she has twice led) and to the environmental cause generally. In an open letter to her constituents, she highlights some of the progress made on green, and other, issues over the past 13 years. Explaining her decision to stand down, she says: The intensity of these constituency commitments, together with the particular responsibilities of being my party’s sole MP, mean that, ironically, I’ve not been able to focus as much as I would like on the existential challenges that drive me – the nature and climate emergencies. I have always been a different kind of politician – as those who witnessed my arrest, court case and acquittal over peaceful protest at the fracking site in Balcombe nearly ten years ago will recall. And the truth is, as these threats to our precious planet become ever more urgent, I have struggled to spend the time I want on these accelerating crises. I have therefore decided not to stand again as your MP at the next election. The reason I came into politics was to change things. Thirteen years ago it’s inconceivable that parliament would have declared a climate emergency. And I’ve put issues like a universal basic income and a legal right to access nature on the political agenda; secured the first parliamentary debate in a generation on drug law reform; and thanks to my work in parliament, a natural history GCSE will soon be on the syllabus. I have said the previously unsayable, only to see it become part of the mainstream, on coal, on the myth that endless economic growth makes us happier, on a green new deal. My determination to trying to make change is stronger than ever. I look forward to having the time to explore ever more imaginative and creative ways of helping to make a liveable future a reality. Watch this space! In 2010 #Brighton Pavilion made history by electing me UK’s 1st Green MP & it’s been the honour of my life. My open letter to residents & friends explains why I’m not standing at next General Election.

The fires are a “really clear sign of climate change”, said Mohammadreza Alizadeh, a researcher at McGill University in Montreal, who is also a postdoctoral associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Research shows that climate change has already exacerbated wildfires dramatically. A 2021 study supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association found that climate change has been the main driver of the increase in hot, dry fire weather in the western US. By 2090, global wildfires are expected to increase in intensity by up to 57% thanks to climate change, a United Nations report warned last year. Related: Canada’s wildfires are part of our new climate reality, experts and officials say 2.09pm BST On air quality maps, purple signifies the worst of it.

(Purchasers of 2013’s The Electric Lady could take their pick from the standard edition, featuring a cover titled Concerning Cindi and Her Sisters and the Skull of Night Thrashings, or a deluxe version called Concerning Cindi and the Glow of the Drogon’s Eyes.) Equal parts Afrofuturism and the sexually ambiguous personae of 70s Bowie, Monáe’s albums to date posited her as a part-human, part-cyborg figure in a dystopian future. And you couldn’t fault Monáe’s sense of commitment to her roles, which extended to apparently giving interviews in character. But the records sold well rather than spectacularly, spawning hits that slow-burned to gold status without actually making the Top 40. On her fourth album, however, everything has changed. The high concepts and Afrofuturism appear to have gone out of the window. Rather than a stylised illustration of a heavily coiffed and costumed Monáe complete with a wordy subtitle, the cover of The Age of Pleasure features a blurry snap of the singer topless and underwater, swimming through a succession of people’s legs. It clocks in at a trim 31 minutes, less than half the length of either The Electric Lady or The ArchAndroid, and its songs, interludes and fleeting guest appearances – Grace Jones speaking French; a brief burst of toasting from venerable Jamaican DJ Sister Nancy – segue into each other. And its lyrical focus shifts dramatically from future dystopias to partying and having it off. There are songs named after champagne cocktails, and recordings of Monáe and friends toasting each other as they embark on an evening of bar-hopping. It takes 90 seconds for her to mention Japanese rope bondage and that’s the tone pretty much set: homemade porn, threesomes, demands to “feel a little tongue”, a song apparently about wanking that opens with the attention-grabbing line: “If I could fuck me right here, right now, I would.” All this is set to rhythms rooted in reggae and dancehall, overlaid with bursts of Afrobeat horns – Fela Kuti’s son Seun and his band Egypt 80 are also among the guests – and atmospheres that recall the laid-back 70s soul of Kool & the Gang’s Summer Madness, or Lowrell’s Mellow Mellow Right On. It doesn’t always work. There’s something smart and subversive about Monáe using reggae to hymn queer relationships on Lipstick Lover – it is, after all, a genre historically tainted by appalling homophobia – but the track’s perky, poppy lope steers perilously close to Ace of Base territory. When it does work, however, it’s fantastic. Champagne Shit offers dubby vocal effects and a sly rhythmic shift into mid-tempo house; Phenomenal comes infused with a shot of South African amapiano. The album’s highlight is I Only Have Eyes 4 2 which conjures up an enveloping dreamy ambience and borrows the chorus from the Flamingos’ similarly titled doo-wop classic. Janelle Monáe: The Age of Pleasure album art. Photograph: PR Recent profiles of Monáe have made clear that the partying and having it off come with a side-order of earnest stuff about self-acceptance and self-discovery, “actively focusing on being present”, reorienting your life around pleasure, etc. If you question whether pop music necessarily needs earnest justification for being about partying and having it off – given that these things have pretty much been pop music’s main focus for the last 75 years – well, that’s 2023 for you. Either way, it’s an earnestness that sometimes seeps on to The Age of Pleasure itself. The direct lyrical references to personal development are over and done with early on, but there are moments when Monáe’s vocals feel oddly stiff, as if she’s playing another role, or trying a little too hard. The commands she issues during Phenomenal sound less stentorian than wooden; there’s something dead-eyed about the singing on Know Better, or about Paid in Pleasure’s chant of “pleasure, pleasure, pleasure”. It’s an album about hedonistic abandon that occasionally makes hedonistic abandon sound like something challenging a therapist has tasked you to do before next week’s session. Then again, the album’s brevity means those moments pass quickly, to be supplanted by moments when Monáe sounds as light and warm as the music behind her: singing in an airy high register on The Rush; lushly multi-tracked on Water Slide; rapping – something she’s always been impressively skilled at – on Haute (“They say I look better than David Bowie in a moonage dream”) or Champagne Shit. And at moments like that, The Age of Pleasure’s flaws feel forgivable. If it’s not always the unfettered joy it purports to be, it’s a dramatic pivot unlikely to alienate anyone drawn to the old high-concept Janelle Monáe. Given pop’s current risk-averse climate, that’s an achievement in itself.

The town of Oleshky appears to be the worst-affected area in territory controlled by Russia. Videos and photographs from the scene have depicted severe flooding and residents stranded on the roofs of their cottages. Reports have emerged indicating that Russian forces were preventing local volunteers from evacuating people in Oleshky by setting up checkpoints around the town. Related: Maps show how Kakhovka dam collapse threatens Ukraine’s bread basket Helping to Leave, an organisation that provides aid and services to Ukrainians fleeing the war, said it had been unable to organise evacuations. “They are not allowing volunteers on boats to enter,” a representative from the group told the Guardian. “[Russian] emergency services are carrying out some evacuation but it’s very selective and it is not enough.” At least five people have died in Russian-occupied parts of southern Ukraine since the dam burst. Russian emergency services on Thursday said that evacuations were under way, but some residents and human rights groups criticised Russia’s efforts. “The Russian emergency services are evacuating a small percentage of people but, judging from the volume of evacuation requests we are receiving, absolutely not as many as they should,” the Helping to Leave representative said. The representative said their organisation had received more than 350 evacuation requests from people stuck on the Russian-controlled southern bank of the river. One such request, the organisation said, came at midnight from three pensioners who were floating around the town on inflatable mattresses. Sergei, a local volunteer, said the situation in Oleshky was “bad”. A woman and her pet being helped to safety in Kherson. Photograph: Ed Ram/The Guardian “There is almost no contact with the people there. No one is allowed into the town and those who make it out on boats are placed into buses and driven away,” he said. “We tried reaching Oleshky but checkpoints have been set up all around the town. A lot of people are waiting to be evacuated. We have heard stories of people drowning, but we can’t confirm because there is no access.” There appeared to be no phone signal in Oleshky on Thursday, leaving many relatives to frantically search online for information about their loved ones. Svetlana, an Oleshky native who moved to Kherson after the city’s liberation last autumn, told the Guardian her mother and aunt remained in the town. “My mother told me yesterday that they would go on the roof until someone rescues them,” she said. “The local authorities didn’t instruct them what to do. I am calling the Russian emergency services all the time but they aren’t helping … Russia has just forgotten about them.” Local Telegram channels were also full of desperate messages from relatives, asking for their loved ones to be rescued. One message read: “SOS!!! Can anyone with a boat help? Cottagers Anna .. and her husband have been sitting on their roof since morning, praying for rescue. They’ve raised a white flag. It’s the first house on the right. Help!!!” Another said: “Help! How can people in Oleshky be saved? Everyone in the Red Army district is sitting on the roof, waiting for assistance. Animals are sinking, drowning.” The Kazkova Dibrova zoo on the Russian-held riverbank was completely flooded and all 300 animals were dead, a representative said via the zoo’s Facebook account. There appeared to be isolated reports of Ukrainian volunteers on boats performing daring rescue operations in Russian-occupied land to rescue stranded locals. In one video on social media, a mother and her young son are seen being evacuated by boat and brought across the Dnipro to Kyiv-controlled territory. The mother and son are then seen thanking the Ukrainian volunteers. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, visiting the flood-hit southern region of Kherson. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images In an address on Wednesday evening, Zelenskiy said it was impossible to predict how many people would die in Russian-occupied parts of Kherson due to the flooding, urging a “clear and rapid reaction from the world” to support victims. He also severely criticised the UN and the Red Cross, who he said were not helping the relief effort. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, similarly called on international humanitarian organisations to provide assistance on the occupied southern bank. “We appeal to you to take charge of evacuating people from the territory of Kherson oblast occupied by Russia. We must save the lives of people whom the occupiers have condemned to death,” Shmyhal said. On Thursday, Zelenskiy visited the flood-stricken section of Kherson. The Ukrainian president said more than 2,000 people had been rescued from the flooding.","Id":"world/2023/jun/08/russian-forces-accused-of-blocking-flood-evacuation-efforts","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Russian forces accused of blocking flood evacuation efforts in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/russian-forces-accused-of-blocking-flood-evacuation-efforts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/08/russian-forces-accused-of-blocking-flood-evacuation-efforts","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":751,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T12:53:04Z","id":"world/2023/jun/08/russian-forces-accused-of-blocking-flood-evacuation-efforts","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"NHS chiefs blame staff shortages for record 7.4m people on waiting lists in England","body":"Health leaders have blamed staff shortages for waiting lists reaching another record high, with 7.4 million people in England waiting to start treatment as of the end of April. One NHS leader said the figures showed that unsustainable “pressure continues to pile on an overstretched NHS”, and urged the government to speed up publication of its long-awaited workforce plan, which has been repeatedly postponed. Waiting list figures in England have crept up again after showing signs of improvement in recent months, despite Rishi Sunak citing bringing numbers down as one of the government’s top five priorities for 2023. Downing Street on Thursday insisted the NHS was “continuing to make progress to ensure patients are seen more quickly”, pointing to record numbers of doctors and nurses in the NHS. The number of people waiting more than a year rose in April to more than 371,111, while close to 11,500 have been waiting more than 18 months to start routine hospital treatment at the end of April, up from about 10,700 at the end of March. The government and the NHS had previously pledged to eliminate 18-month waits by April 2023 other than exceptionally complex cases or by patients’ choice. Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive at NHS Providers, said “demand continues to outstrip capacity in the NHS”, with trust leaders facing record demand in urgent and emergency care. Related: Cancer patients face life-threatening delays due to lack of staff, say UK radiologists Last month was the busiest May on record for A&E attendances at close to 2.3 million, 4,500 more patients a day more than the previous month. Cordery said: “Not only are [trust leaders] still recovering from one of the toughest winters ever, but they are having to manage escalating strikes and worrying levels of staff burnout. Every part of the NHS is under strain including community and mental health services.” Saoirse Mallorie, a senior analyst at the King’s Fund thinktank, said the figures showed “stalling progress”, which she said was due to NHS staff working “flat out” and pressure on hospital and social care services delaying medically fit people from leaving. “Further planned industrial action this month will cause additional disruption,” she added. “We seem to be stuck in a loop of national NHS workforce plans being repeatedly promised and then postponed, while patients and staff continue to pay the price of protracted uncertainty,” she said, adding that the plan and its funding arrangements would be a “real test” of the government’s commitment to the NHS. Tim Gardner, the assistant director of policy at the Health Foundation charity, noted that the root cause of the long waiting lists was “over a decade in the making”. Referencing figures showing that in May, over 31,000 people spent more than 12 hours “often in avoidable pain” on trolleys in emergency departments waiting for a hospital bed, he said: “Until the government has a coherent long-term strategy for recruiting and retaining enough staff, there is no viable route out of this crisis.” NHS England said it was making progress and that staff were working hard to reduce long waits for elective care with more than 1.2 million people receiving elective treatment in April. The NHS England national medical director, Prof Sir Stephen Powis, attributed the increase to people “who may have put off coming forward for care over the past few years of the pandemic” seeking help. He added that a record number of people had received cancer checks or started treatment for cancer within the service in the past year. NHS data shows that the service missed all its cancer targets in April, worse than in the previous month. Just 78% of patients were seen within two weeks of an urgent referral to a cancer consultant by their GP, down from 84% in March and significantly below the target of 91%. Minesh Patel, the head of policy at the charity Macmillan Cancer Support, said the impact of long waiting lists on people with cancer was devastating. “Thousands of people with cancer are continuing to be let down by a system that simply cannot cope”, resulting in excruciating delays to receive a diagnosis or start treatment, leading to anxiety and putting lives at risk, he said. The NHS data also shows that ambulance callouts for emergency calls, including for heart attacks and strokes, took an average of 32 minutes and 24 seconds in May, almost six minutes longer than the month previous. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Cutting waiting lists is one of the government’s top five priorities, and the NHS has reduced the number of patients waiting for more than 18 months by over 91% since the September 2021 peak and virtually eliminated two-year waits for treatment, despite more people coming forward for treatment. “There are more doctors, nurses and staff working in the NHS than ever before, which has led to a record number of cancer patients being treated over the last two years – and in April there were a record number of diagnostic tests carried out per working day. “Our elective and urgent and emergency care recovery plans will deliver one of the fastest and longest sustained improvements in waiting times in NHS history, and we have made up to £14.1bn available for health and social care over the next two years, on top of record funding.”","Id":"society/2023/jun/08/nhs-chiefs-blame-staff-shortages-record-74m-people-waiting-lists-england","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"NHS chiefs blame staff shortages for record 7.4m people on waiting lists in England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/08/nhs-chiefs-blame-staff-shortages-record-74m-people-waiting-lists-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/jun/08/nhs-chiefs-blame-staff-shortages-record-74m-people-waiting-lists-england","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":881,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T12:46:13Z","id":"society/2023/jun/08/nhs-chiefs-blame-staff-shortages-record-74m-people-waiting-lists-england","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"GMB halts bid for official Amazon union, claiming firm skewed staff numbers","body":"The GMB has reluctantly withdrawn its attempt to win formal union recognition at Amazon’s Coventry warehouse, accusing the firm of drafting in more than 1,000 extra workers to skew the decision. GMB members at the site made a formal request for recognition to the independent central arbitration committee (CAC) last month after a concerted recruitment drive for members that it believed took it past the necessary threshold of support. Workers at the vast depot, known as BHX4, have held a series of strike days since January – the first at a UK Amazon facility – and the GMB says membership has more than quadrupled to 800. The union believed that comfortably represented more than half of the 1,400 staff it estimated to be working at the site, enough to prompt the CAC to grant statutory recognition. On the basis of evidence submitted by the firm, however, the Guardian understands the CAC has endorsed Amazon’s statement that as many as 2,700 people are now employed there. The GMB could have pressed ahead, which might have prompted the CAC to call a ballot to gauge support from staff, but if it lost such a vote it could not make another request for recognition at the same site for three years. It has therefore opted to withdraw its application to the CAC, and to continue trying to build up its strength at BHX4 and nearby sites. The union will hold further strikes at the Coventry warehouse on 12, 13 and 14 of June. Stuart Richards, a regional organiser for the GMB in the West Midlands, said: “Amazon has refused to pay workers a decent wage, but are now paying an additional 1,300 workers to try and bust the union. “We estimate that’s more than £300,000 a week, just to stop workers having a voice in their workplace. This is more than it would cost to pay the original workforce the £15 an hour they were asking for.” Amazon firmly rejects the idea that it has been hiring staff to frustrate the GMB’s effort to win recognition, but workers at the plant have reported seeing a large number of new colleagues arriving in recent weeks. One staff member told the Guardian: “We saw this happening, at breakneck speed. They usually have two [packing] lines for the new people. They’ve had to have four lines. They’ve never had four lines. … They wear hi-vis so they stick out like a sore thumb.” Another said: “Each instructor’s given eight people to walk round, so you just count the instructors.” Amazon insisted that any hiring that had taken place at BHX4 was the result of normal business requirements. A spokesperson said: “At Amazon, we regularly recruit new team members, across the country and across the year, providing great new career opportunities for thousands of people and to meet customer demand. This year is no different.” News of the CAC’s decision came two days after the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, backed the GMB’s campaign at Amazon, calling it “fantastic” and urging the company to recognise the union. He also said a Labour government would impose conditions on public procurement contracts to ensure they create “unionised jobs,” with good pay and conditions. He was responding to a question from Garfield Hylton, one of the Amazon strikers who were celebrated at the Brighton gathering for their efforts in organising workers against a business well known to be reluctant to work with unions. Staff are currently being balloted for industrial action at two other Amazon depots, in Mansfield and Rugeley, though union membership there is lower. Action at Coventry began with a spontaneous walkout last summer after staff were awarded a 50p an hour pay rise. Amazon has since given staff another increase, and recently announced new rights for working parents. When the GMB initially requested recognition, the firm responded with a statement saying: “Amazon respects our employees’ rights to join, or not to join, a union. We offer competitive pay, comprehensive benefits, opportunities for career growth, all while working in a safe, modern, work environment. “At Amazon, these benefits and opportunities come with the job, as does the ability to communicate directly with the leadership of the company.”","Id":"technology/2023/jun/08/gmb-halts-bid-for-official-amazon-union-claiming-firm-skewed-staff-numbers","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webTitle":"GMB halts bid for official Amazon union, claiming firm skewed staff numbers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/08/gmb-halts-bid-for-official-amazon-union-claiming-firm-skewed-staff-numbers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/jun/08/gmb-halts-bid-for-official-amazon-union-claiming-firm-skewed-staff-numbers","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":696,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T12:38:56Z","id":"technology/2023/jun/08/gmb-halts-bid-for-official-amazon-union-claiming-firm-skewed-staff-numbers","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Swizzels agrees to M&S demand to redesign its rival sweet to Percy Pig","body":"Marks & Spencer’s Percy Pig is wallowing in glory after the British confectioner Swizzels agreed to redesign a sweet that the retailer alleged had been masquerading as its popular pink treat. M&S said it had reached an “amicable resolution” with Swizzels under which the maker of Refreshers and Parma Violets had agreed to change the design of its Pigs Mugs sweets, which have been on sale since 1996. Lawyers for the high street chain had claimed that the two sweets’ designs were so similar that its customers might have bought the wrong item in error. A 37-page document filed at the high court in London in November said the Percy Pig brand had generated a £131.7m turnover since its launch in 1993 and that today 271 bags a minute are sold. The brand has been a key part of M&S’s efforts to reinvent itself as a family food retailer, featuring in its Christmas ads and a plethora of different products from pyjamas to cupcakes as well as the original confectionery. In its legal submission, M&S cited an example of a customer who loved the fruit gums so much they had got a tattoo of Percy’s face. Percy is not immune to controversy, however, causing a stir in 2019 when M&S changed the recipe to remove gelatine and make him vegetarian, prompting complaints of a deterioration in flavour. Responding to the Swizzels victory, an M&S spokesperson said: “M&S has a proud history as a leading innovator and for almost 140 years customers have turned to M&S for unique, original, quality products – conceived, created and developed alongside trusted suppliers and produced to the highest standards. “M&S has made a significant investment in building a strong Percy Pig brand over the past 30 years and believe it is important to protect the registered trademarks relating to Percy Pig’s appearance.” The group’s latest triumph in a food fight comes after M&S successfully brought legal action against Aldi to protect its bestselling Colin the Caterpillar cake. M&S had called in the lawyers over concerns that the German discount chain’s rival chocolate sponge roll, Cuthbert, was making copycat appearances at birthday parties and picnics. Aldi also lost a court battle against M&S earlier this year after being accused of copying its light-up Christmas gin bottles.","Id":"business/2023/jun/08/swizzels-agrees-to-ms-demand-to-redesign-its-rival-sweet-to-percy-pig","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webTitle":"Swizzels agrees to M&S demand to redesign its rival sweet to Percy Pig","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/08/swizzels-agrees-to-ms-demand-to-redesign-its-rival-sweet-to-percy-pig","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jun/08/swizzels-agrees-to-ms-demand-to-redesign-its-rival-sweet-to-percy-pig","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":379,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T12:35:54Z","id":"business/2023/jun/08/swizzels-agrees-to-ms-demand-to-redesign-its-rival-sweet-to-percy-pig","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"People call me brave for going through cancer treatment – but the scary bit starts now","body":"I am probably the wussiest person I know. I almost cried when I somehow found myself on the pirate ship at Chessington World of Adventures. If you put me in the same room as a rodent I will end up standing on a chair like someone from a Tom and Jerry cartoon. I have a friend who used to come and check under my bed whenever I was left home alone as a teenager. Yes, sometimes I do front up to things I’m scared of, but there is a long list of adjectives I’d apply to myself before I hit upon the word “brave”. Yet since I got my breast cancer diagnosis last summer, it is a word lots of people have used about me. I’m not complaining – people have meant it kindly – but I would argue that so far it hasn’t really applied. I have been scared on many occasions, self-pitying on others – and sometimes both at the same time. When I was told I was ill and had a 5cm grade three tumour I feared the worst and spent several days crying and worrying. Ahead of starting my chemotherapy several weeks later I spent a lot of time dreading the drugs I was about to be given and the whole process of having them fed into me by the port they had put into my chest. Every week when they punctured my skin to put in the line from the drip I winced. I still look the other way whenever I have a blood test, I cried whenever my hair fell out, and I’ve often asked: “Why me?” I would say I have had some stoical moments, but “brave” suggests something more active and stronger than I think I’ve been. I think the way I have acted is pretty much the same way anyone would act. I want to get better and move on so I’ve agreed to the treatment I’ve been offered, no matter the side-effects. I’ve smiled when things have been rubbish because even then there were still things to smile about. I have, occasionally, not felt as good as I’ve pretended, but that was more social conditioning than bravery. The people who I think are brave are those who trialled the drugs I now take. The carers who look after their loved ones and keep smiling and encouraging them, even when they are tired and scared themselves. But some of them may also say that they don’t feel brave. I haven’t really needed to be all that brave so far. Throughout my treatment experts have been there to hold my hand, sometimes literally. This has made things less scary. I’ve had to engage with the explanations of the treatment and sometimes faced a choice of paths, but I’ve felt that the difficult bit was in someone else’s power. Those people are experts and if you trust them, as I do, you can get a lot of comfort. While you’re having treatment you are in someone else’s hands. You are having an active intervention. You can believe that anything bad is being blasted by the drugs. That nothing would dare harm you. You are being monitored by experts and can relax knowing they should spot any problems. You feel you can ask their advice about even the most minor change in yourself that you’ve spotted. There is something daunting about emerging from this as I now am. Surprisingly, I feel I will need to be braver at this point than I have been since being diagnosed. It’s a bit like I’m a wild animal being released from captivity – I have to learn how to cope in the big bad world without the support networks I have been leaning on heavily for the last few months. In theory, I am pretty much fixed. The chemo and the surgery have been effective, and the radiotherapy I’ve had and tablets I am taking will hopefully put paid to any cancer that might still be lurking. The doctors have talked positively about what they’ve done, and have told me I’m doing all I can to prevent a recurrence. But once you stop being poked and prodded you wonder what could go wrong. There are still checkups, but the time between them is longer and I will need to take back responsibility for monitoring myself the rest of the time. Things will never be exactly as they were. I will need to be more careful now that my adrenal glands don’t work and I have to take hydrocortisone every day (as I type I realise I’ve forgotten my lunchtime dose). Even getting over the treatment will take longer than I’d realised – I’ve been warned that it could be a year before I get over chemo physically. I don’t look much different from when I went off sick, but bits of me are broken or gone. And it may be a while before the bits that are left are back up to speed. People have often said I look well (which I’ve taken as code for having a bit of a fat face), so I do worry that they will expect the same from me as from someone who hasn’t been through the mill. More than that, I wonder how to go back to looking to the future without caveats. I’m apprehensive about planning a holiday for this year and looking beyond that fills me with fear. Related: I used to hide behind my hair. But cancer gave me a buzzcut and helped me find my voice | Joanne Harris I used to think a lot about myself as an older person. I imagine it was partly because my grandma seemed to enjoy her later years – after my grandad died, she reunited with her friends from school and her cousins. She spent Friday afternoons enjoying long lunches with all of them, and the rest of the week catching up with individuals over coffee or on the phone. There was sadness that my grandad wasn’t around any more, and I included that in my vision of the future – I wasn’t sugar-coating it. But now I find it difficult to think about any of that without crying. That picture of me as an old lady feels more tinged with hope than expectation. It’s like I have lost my innocence. But I am hoping that this will wear off as time goes on. At some point, all being well, I will need to drop the caveats like the one I just typed. I will need to move to a new way of living, to give away the hats I bought without worrying that I’m tempting fate by doing so, to book trips without looking at them through the prism of cancer. I need to be braver than before – but I will never go back on that pirate ship.

Cpl Sean Walsh launched the lawsuit over his discharge from the air force almost 50 years ago, describing the treatment he received as degrading and humiliating. Walsh, 75, claims he was discriminated against when he was ordered to leave in 1975 after 12 years of service. At the time, there was a ban on gay people serving in the armed forces. However, 48 years on, Walsh has lost his discrimination case after the tribunal ruled it did not have jurisdiction because what happened to Walsh was lawful at the time. Sean Walsh said the treatment he received was ‘extremely degrading and humiliating’. Photograph: Solent News & Photo Agency The claim by Walsh is thought to be one of the oldest of its kind in British legal history. It comes as the long-awaited LGBT veterans independent review on the impact of the pre-2000 ban on homosexuality in the armed forces is about to be published. Walsh, who was a telegraphist in the RAF, said he was falsely accused while posted in south Asia. He said: “I was interviewed by a sergeant from the RAF’s special investigation branch and was advised that an allegation had been made against me, and that I was now suspected of having homosexual tendencies, which I denied and still continue to do so. “I was given a dishonourable discharge, annotated on my RAF records as ‘services no longer required’. I was not given any advice, nor did I have any means of appealing against the RAF’s decision.” He said he kept his reasons for leaving the RAF from his second wife and other veterans. He suffered from social anxiety and never attended reunions. After getting prostate cancer in 2020, Walsh filed a claim for compensation against the MoD. A wing commander wrote back that – regrettably – in 1975 discrimination on grounds of actual or perceived sexual orientation was lawful. The officer said his “discharge appeared to have been unfair” as he had not been given a chance to see the evidence against him or respond to allegations, but added: “In 1975 your discharge was considered to be reasonable as well as lawful, even though what you experienced would not be countenanced today.” She pointed him to avenues of support and recognition for service veterans. Walsh, from east London, tried to sue the MoD for discrimination at London central employment tribunal. He represented himself at the hearing, while the MoD was represented by a KC. The employment judge Holly Stout has now dismissed his case, saying the tribunal had no jurisdiction over it. The judge concluded that under the sexual orientation regulations that came into force in 2003, unlawful discrimination can be brought to an employment tribunal. But as the tribunal’s jurisdiction was limited to discrimination that was unlawful, Walsh’s claim could not be heard as it was lawful at the time.","Id":"uk-news/2023/jun/08/raf-veteran-wrongly-believed-to-be-gay-loses-employment-tribunal-over-1975-discharge","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"RAF veteran wrongly believed to be gay loses employment tribunal over 1975 discharge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/08/raf-veteran-wrongly-believed-to-be-gay-loses-employment-tribunal-over-1975-discharge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/jun/08/raf-veteran-wrongly-believed-to-be-gay-loses-employment-tribunal-over-1975-discharge","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":492,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T12:31:11Z","id":"uk-news/2023/jun/08/raf-veteran-wrongly-believed-to-be-gay-loses-employment-tribunal-over-1975-discharge","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Michael Caine’s novel will most likely be rubbish, but I’m glad he’s found his happy ending","body":"God spare us another millionaire actor who fancies themself as a bestselling author –unless the actor is Michael Caine, in which case good on him, raise your glass. The 90-year mainstay of British cinema spent lockdown writing his first novel, tapping away at his iPad every day, toiling to master the intricacies of the craft. “Paragraphs,” he said. “Punctuation, all that.” The book might be awful. It won’t trouble the Man Booker panel. But in finally completing the thing, Caine has indirectly written himself a happy ending of sorts – the most knackered and lovely writer’s cliche of them all. According to Caine’s publishers, Deadly Game is “a cracking thriller with a real voice and a super twist”, although quite frankly, what else would they say? Specifically, it’s about a London DCI, Harry Taylor, who’s on the trail of a stash of uranium. Potential suspects include a posh art dealer called Julian Smythe, and a dodgy oligarch, Vladimir Voldrev. Also in the mix: a couple of neo-Nazis, a Colombian drug cartel (possibly several, going from the press release) and a pair of cockney refuse collectors. Caine says he got the basic idea from a newspaper story he once read about two East End blokes who found uranium on the rubbish tip. Everything else (the Nazis, the Colombians, dodgy Vladimir) is 100% uncut Michael Caine. In publishing Deadly Game, the actor turned novelist joins a line of other actor turned novelists. This Grand Hotel-style ensemble ranges from Ethan Hawke to Marlon Brando to Carrie Fisher to Gene Hackman to Caine’s erstwhile Dirty Rotten Scoundrels co-star, Steve Martin. I confess that I’ve avoided reading any of the books written by these actors for much the same reason I wouldn’t go to them to have my brake cable fixed or my filling repaired, because I figure that there are other, trained people who would almost certainly do a better job. Earlier this year, Tom Hanks also published a debut novel. I did wade through that one and wouldn’t recommend the experience. It was like being trapped in a lift with a garrulous bore. So let’s take it as read that Deadly Game will most likely be rubbish, in the same way that most vanity projects are rubbish (in the same way that plenty of traditional novels are, come to that). I’m still delighted that Caine has finished the thing and is now getting it published, because I had been invested in this story and was awaiting an update. When I interviewed the actor in late 2021, he explained that he had basically retired from acting and was keeping himself busy writing instead. He added that the two great loves of his life had always been the cinema and the library. He’d covered the cinema, up and down, back and forth. Finally, at the end, he was circling back to the library. Caine didn’t want to talk about movies that day. He wanted to talk about books. “Oh, I read books like wildfire,” he said. “There’s an American author called Tom Clancy. He’s my favourite. Anything and everything by him.” He said he liked Lee Child as well. “I’m an adventure man. I don’t do literature. I just do fun. Gangs, guns and war, that sort of thing.” Defending the Khyber Pass with old friend Sean Connery in The Man Who Would Be King. Photograph: Columbia/Sportsphoto/Allstar When the interview was over, I played back the recording. It was like listening to two separate conversations with two separate men. The first man was old. He complained about his gammy leg and his failing memory. He said he was having to sell his big house in Surrey and move somewhere smaller near his daughter. He talked about the friends who had already died (Roger Moore, Sean Connery) and the others who were clinging on but wouldn’t last much longer. “We all got so old,” he kept saying, as though life had played a horrid trick. The other man was different and the contrast was striking. Time and again, Caine brought the subject back around to his book. The years fell away. He was lively, enthusiastic, self-deprecating. The publishers, he admitted, had gone over the manuscript and sent it back for a major rewrite. “They’re telling me, ‘Do this, don’t do that. That bit’s not true’.” He told me the book’s plot in some detail and explained that he mostly wrote propped up in bed. Film acting involves standing around for days on end, which he was now unable to manage, not on his dodgy leg. Whereas writing he could do when he liked, how he liked. “I’m just having the best time doing it,” he said. The title, Caine said, was If You Don’t Want to Die. That’s since been changed. I think he should have kept it. It seemed to sum up the spirit behind the book, as if the act of writing itself was somehow death-defying, possibly even regenerative and never mind the finished product. Here it was in his comfortable Surrey bedroom: a fresh challenge for the actor who held the line at Rorke’s Drift and battled bandits in the Khyber Pass.

This has led to warnings about the region and wider world’s food supply, with Ukraine accounting for 40% of global trade in sunflower meal, 35% of sunflower oil, and 5% of wheat, barley and corn exports. A series of canals run from the Kakhovka reservoir, all of which help irrigate swathes of agricultural land in southern Ukraine. If the reservoir dries up, this water supply will be reduced. Interactive The most significant of these canals are the North Crimean and Kakhovsky canals, which run from just north of the broken dam. The North Crimean canal supplies water to western Kherson before flowing down to Crimea. Its entrance is just before the dam and satellite imagery from 6 June already shows increased greenery within its reservoir – a sign of the water level decreasing. Interactive The Kakhovsky canal irrigates most of the Kherson region’s fields before entering Zaporizhzhia. Dnipro region is also supported by the Dnipro-Kryvyi Rih canal which runs north of the Kakhovka reservoir, while a separate canal system provides drinking water and irrigation to the city of Zaporizhzhia. Satellite imagery of the area directly south of the reservoir, around these canals, shows mile upon mile of agricultural land. The circular formations are caused by a centre-pivot irrigation system that waters crops with equipment that rotates around a pivot. Interactive Ukraine’s most important crops are corn, wheat, sunflower seed and barley. All of these yields are already down by at least a fifth in 2023-24, according to the US Department of Agriculture. There are fears that declining levels in the Kakhovka reservoir will mean less water feeding through to the network of canals used to irrigate these crops. With the exception of corn, which has its biggest yields in northern Ukraine, the other three crops are centred in the south. Interactive Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia are some of the most important regions for wheat and both rely on canals that run from the reservoir. Dnipro is similarly important for sunflower seed. While Odesa and Mykolaiv have the biggest yields for barley, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson are all still big producers of this crop. Already images from the village of Marianske in Dnipro, taken on 7 June, show how reservoir levels have fallen.

The poll showed 88% were concerned about shortages affecting the quality of care. The RCR pointed out that for every four-week delay to treatment, the risk of death increased by about 10%.

The RCR warned that staff shortages meant people were waiting longer than necessary to start chemotherapy or radiotherapy, while some doctors were having to make “difficult decisions” about who to prioritise and were sending patients to other hospitals. According to one head of service, prostate radiotherapy patients in their area were facing a three-month minimum wait to receive treatment, while breast cancer patients had a seven- to eight-week wait. Staff shortages also meant costly medical devices, including linear accelerator machines for radiation, had to be switched off owing to the lack of people able to operate them, the RCR said. Its report states that the UK has a 15% shortfall of clinical oncologists but by 2027 this figure will rise to 25%. Over the next five years, one in five clinical oncologists are expected to retire, and more than half (54%) of current clinical oncology vacancies have been open for more than a year, it adds. Meanwhile, the proportion of more expensive locum staff being used has grown from 4% to 8% in the past two years. The RCR published two reports on Thursday, one looking specifically at cancer care and the other at the clinical radiology workforce. In the second report, 80% of directors surveyed said they believed a shortage in the number of interventional radiology consultants was causing patients to receive more invasive treatment. In 97% of centres, patient treatment had been delayed because of staff shortages over the past year, while in about half of centres, shortages were causing delays almost every month, the RCR audit found. About 90% of those questioned thought workforce shortages would affect patient safety and only one in four said they had enough staff to deliver safe and effective care. The report says 52% of trusts could provide adequate 24/7 interventional radiology services. The RCR warned that across the UK there were 4,745 whole-time-equivalent radiologists working in the NHS and the consultant workforce had a 29% shortfall. It said there was a “ticking timebomb”, adding: “Without action, there will be a 40% shortfall of radiologists by 2027.” Most consultants who left in 2022 were under 60, with many experiencing burnout, according to the RCR. It said new community diagnostic centres set up by the NHS had increased the workload on already stretched staff. Dr Katharine Halliday, the RCR president, said: “There are simply not enough doctors to safely treat the volume of patients needed, and this will only worsen as demand rises and more doctors leave the NHS. “Action from the government is now critical. We must train more doctors, while doing more to retain the ones we have. There is no luxury of time: doctors are stretched, stressed, and scared for their patients.” Michelle Mitchell, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: “Due to underfunding and poor planning from governments across the UK, there isn’t enough staff or equipment to diagnose and treat cancer in a timely way. “We urge political leaders in all UK nations to act now to address chronic staffing issues and unacceptable waiting times across the NHS.” She said without long-term and strategic planning matched with sufficient investment, it would continue to be difficult for people to benefit quickly from life-saving cancer checks and treatment. Minesh Patel, the head of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: “Macmillan and the Royal College of Radiologists have been sounding the alarm about the devastating impact of staffing shortages on delays to diagnosis and treatment for years but the crisis continues to be brushed aside by governments. “At the heart of this crisis is a failure to recruit and retain enough specialist cancer professionals.” Downing Street said it was bringing in measures to speed up cancer care. A spokesperson said: “More than 260,000 patients were seen following an urgent GP referral in March 2023, which is the highest figure since data collection began. But we know there’s more to do, which is why we opened 108 community diagnostic centres and we’ve delivered over 3.9m additional tests, including for cancer.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “There are more doctors, nurses and staff working in the NHS than ever before, with 50% more specialist cancer doctors treating patients now compared to 2010. “The NHS is also seeing, treating and saving record numbers of people with cancer but we know there is more to do. That is why we are seeking views on our major conditions strategy and the NHS will soon be publishing a long-term workforce plan setting out how it will recruit and retain even more staff.”","Id":"society/2023/jun/08/cancer-patients-delays-treatment-staff-shortage-uk-radiologists","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Cancer patients face life-threatening delays due to lack of staff, say UK radiologists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/08/cancer-patients-delays-treatment-staff-shortage-uk-radiologists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/jun/08/cancer-patients-delays-treatment-staff-shortage-uk-radiologists","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":884,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T12:26:21Z","id":"society/2023/jun/08/cancer-patients-delays-treatment-staff-shortage-uk-radiologists","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Pet Shop Boys’ 30 greatest songs – ranked!","body":"30. The Truck Driver and His Mate (1996) Pet Shop Boys’ albums and B-sides are remarkably filler-free, which makes compiling this list hard, even if we exclude their cover versions (hence no Always on My Mind). Case in point: the homoerotic electro-glam stomp of the B-side to Before, as good as anything on Bilingual. 29. Yesterday, When I Was Mad (1993) It certainly wasn’t the first song written about the downside of touring, but Yesterday, When I Was Mad is definitely the wittiest. A protracted, waspish whinge about backstage visitors, critics and petty arguments over hotel rooms, restaurants and meet-and-greets, it’s very funny and very aware of its privileged preposterousness. 28. Integral (2006) “If you’ve done thing wrong / You’ve got nothing to fear / If you’ve something to hide / You shouldn’t even be here.” Integral is the best track from Fundamental, with the producer Trevor Horn constructing a dramatic, distinctly Frankie-ish dancefloor pulse. The lyrics about immigration and the right’s quest for a “sterile, immaculate” Britain feel eternally pertinent. As seen in the 80s. Photograph: Sunshine/Rex/Shutterstock 27. Shameless (1993) Lyrically and musically ferocious – the sound is deliberately brash and trebley – Shameless gleefully blasts celebrity culture (“We have no integrity”). It is either weirdly prescient, or the work of people complaining with no idea how bad things are going to get; Shameless predates reality TV and the web. 26. Heart (1987) Take your pick from the album version, the 12in, the Syndrum-infused disco mix, Shep Pettibone’s jittery remix or a beatless, balladesque live reading – in a medley with Go West – on 2019’s Inner Sanctum. Subsequently dismissed by Chris Lowe, Heart is slight in comparison with, say, Being Boring, but lovely nonetheless. 25. Flamboyant (2003) Like Discography’s DJ Culture, this is a new track appended to a best-of that is far better than those tracks tend to be. Produced by the German duo Tomcraft – who give its electronics an impressively steely sound – it features lyrics that admire the “courage” of a glitzy celeb and rhyme “tacky” with “Issey Miyake”. 24. Dreaming of the Queen (1993) In which the Aids crisis and the separation of Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales, are conflated with a dream in which Neil Tennant is presented to the princess naked, surrounded by autograph-seeking fans. Dreaming of the Queen is at turns funny and desperately sad, its melody and ambience haunting. 23. Will-o-the-Wisp (2020) The opening track of Hotspot is punchy, muscular and rooted in big-room house. The lyrics are appealingly ambiguous: the narrator spots an old flame and veers between admiration – “You’re such a handsome thing” – and withering speculation that he has “gone respectable / With a wife and a job and all that”. 22. My October Symphony (1990) House pianos and bassline, washes of synth, gorgeous melody, 3am mid-tempo disco atmosphere, complete with Johnny Marr unleashing his inner Nile Rodgers … and it’s about a Soviet composer questioning the artistic validity of the music he composed in praise of the Communist party after the fall of communism. Fabulous. Playing Primavera in Barcelona last month. Photograph: Alejandro García/EPA 21. Pandemonium (2009) Pandemonium is prime 00s Pet Shop Boys. A glam-facing rhythm, a pile-up of pop hooks, one killer line after another – “When you think about it, it’s quite an achievement / That, after all, I still love you” – and a rare example of Xenomania’s production living up to the standards they set working with Girls Aloud. 20. Suburbia (1986) Inspired by Penelope Spheeris’s bleak 1984 film of the same name, but relocating the action from Los Angeles to a Britain of graffitied bus stops and vandalised town halls, the definitive version of Suburbia is the Full Horror mix found on Disco. The soaring chorus contrasts with barking dogs, eerie spoken word and dissonant instrumental passages. 19. Opportunities (Let’s Make Lots of Money) (1986) Pet Shop Boys’ Born in the USA: a satire of Thatcher-era greed misconstrued as a hearty endorsement. Despite umpteen patient explanations that its protagonists’ dreams and schemes are doomed, the titular opportunities nonexistent, it still turns up on TV documentary soundtracks whenever yuppies are mentioned. 18. Love Is a Bourgeois Construct (2013) Driven by a sample from Michael Nyman’s soundtrack to 1982’s The Draughtsman’s Contract, there is a classic only-the-Pet-Shop-Boys-would-think-of-this conceit here. Failure in love has led its protagonist to turn to his radical “student paperbacks”, Marx among them, for comfort; if his ex comes back, he implies, the class struggle is cancelled. In their imperial phase. Photograph: Mike Prior/Redferns 17. It’s a Sin (1987) A former altar boy, Tennant complained that people took It’s a Sin too seriously; its OTT arrangement certainly implies a jokey intent. But it emerged during a hideous religious backlash against gay people. That it lent its title to Russell T Davies’ 2020 drama underlines how reflective of the climate it inadvertently felt. 16. The Theatre (1993) Pet Shop Boys’ oeuvre is held to have become more political in recent years, but in truth, it has just become more explicitly so, as evinced by The Theatre’s depiction of London’s inequality, inspired by a Conservative minister’s callous remark about homelessness people. The chorus’s crashing orchestration underscores the song’s white-lipped rage. 15. Home and Dry (2002) The album Release attempted to do the opposite of what Pet Shop Boys were known for, an idea most successfully realised on Home and Dry: live drums, guitar solos, a reference to the Beatles Let It Be era. A straightforward and sweetly touching love song. 14. So Hard (1990) Watch the video for So Hard. Behaviour was an album thick with depictions of relationship trauma: Jealousy, To Face the Truth, The End of the World and So Hard. The irresistibly perky chorus of So Hard contrasts with the suspicion and heartbreak in the lyrics. An open relationship isn’t working out; with neither partner willing to commit, it is probably doomed. 13. You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You’re Drunk (1999) The unexpected sound of pedal steel guitar on a Pet Shop Boys track leads into a song that could pass for country and western, albeit with a sequenced synth line running through it. The effect is heartfelt and genuinely touching, the lush strings bolstering its romantic misery. 12. Your Funny Uncle (1988) Inspired by the funeral of a friend who had died of Aids, this is packed with beautifully, sympathetically drawn details: the father who can’t come to terms with his late son’s sexuality, the military uncle greeting the deceased’s friends with kindness. The music – equal parts show tune and 70s singer-songwriter ballad – is suitably heartbreaking. 11. The Pop Kids (2016) The title is 80s Smash-Hits-ese – they regularly reappropriated the Sunday People’s punk-era lament “must we fling this filth at our pop kids?” – but the lyrics are from the perspective of someone looking back to 90s London and breathlessly exciting twentysomething life. It’s classic Pet Shop Boys, in that it’s an electronic banger suffused with sadness: something has clearly gone terribly wrong in the interim, although we are never told what. On stage in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1991. Photograph: Jim Steinfeldt/Getty Images 10. King’s Cross (1987) Pet Shop Boys’ early albums haven’t dated – like New Order, their brand of then-cutting-edge pop has proved timeless – but their descriptions of a London long since vanished make them period pieces. Here, the grubby, ungentrified King’s Cross is a metaphor for 80s Britain in a song that is careworn and atmospheric. 9. Invisible (2012) The duo have managed to grow older while remaining resolutely a pop band. This rich, startlingly beautiful ballad – an overlooked gem – bemoans the trickiness of ageing, professionally and personally. Tennant has said Invisible was inspired by reading a comment from a woman suggesting that she became invisible after turning 45. “Try being a gay man over 50,” he noted. 8. Love Comes Quickly (1986) Neither as striking as West End Girls nor as topical as Opportunities, Love Comes Quickly is the most straightforwardly beautiful of Pet Shop Boys’ early hits. The lyric takes a hackneyed topic and twists it into something original. The sound is breathy, luscious and twilit – pop music as luxury good. 7. This Must Be the Place I Waited Years to Leave (1990) The best Pet Shop Boys album track of all? Quite possibly. Originally written as a potential James Bond theme, with placeholder lyrics – although a Bond film with a despondent theme song about the awfulness of school is an intriguingly peculiar idea – its hazy, exquisite sadness fits the autumnal mood of 1990’s Behaviour. 6. Jealousy (1990) Pet Shop Boys’ melodies frequently carry a hint of French chanson. On Jealousy – the first song they wrote, the first ballad they released as a single – that influence finds full flower. It’s direct and heart-rending; for a band frequently described as arch, they can deliver an emotional punch. Watch the video for What Have I Done to Deserve This?. 5. What Have I Done to Deserve This? (1987) Their label tried to discourage them from working with Dusty Springfield, hitless since 1970. But the duo were insistent – and the result is one of their greatest songs. The moment Springfield takes centre stage (“Since you went away …”) is among the most glorious in their oeuvre. 4. Rent (1987) Bleak but brilliant, Rent tells two stories at once. Its narrator is defiant about the transactional nature of their relationship: the couple are “in sympathy and sometimes ecstasy”, after all. But their unrepentant cynicism is undercut by the music, which sounds subdued, sad and ineffably lonely. 3. Left to My Own Devices (1988) “Awe-inspiring”, suggested Tennant’s former employers Smash Hits of Left to My Own Devices, a deliriously uplifting song about loneliness. The joyousness of its chorus, its lavish flurries of strings and its campness – “Should I take to the stage?” – are entirely at odds with the lyrics’ tone. Smash Hits was right. 2. West End Girls (1984) Inspired by hip-hop, dance music and TS Eliot, its coolly observed vision of London dark but alluring, West End Girls was their breakthrough single and a statement of intent: we are intelligent, we are hip, we are different from anything else in the increasingly wan British pop landscape. Watch the video for Being Boring. 1. Being Boring (1990) Not just one of the greatest songs about the Aids epidemic, but one of the greatest songs written about mortality and memory, Being Boring was a lightning bolt even amid Pet Shop Boys’ imperial phase (the imperial phase for which that phrase was coined). The lyrical evocations of impetuous youthful optimism and painful reflection are magnificent, the lines about bolting through a closing door a perfect example of their ability to turn something specific – the loss of innocence and carefree hedonism wreaked on the gay community by HIV – into something universal about youth. The music perfectly mirrors them, its melodic shift from melancholy to warmth, midway through the verses, understated but extraordinarily powerful. • Smash: The Singles 1985-2020 is released on 16 June on Parlophone","Id":"music/2023/jun/08/pet-shop-boys-30-greatest-songs-ranked","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pet Shop Boys’ 30 greatest songs – ranked!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/08/pet-shop-boys-30-greatest-songs-ranked","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/jun/08/pet-shop-boys-30-greatest-songs-ranked","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts","wordcount":1803,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T12:12:10Z","id":"music/2023/jun/08/pet-shop-boys-30-greatest-songs-ranked","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Chris Christie says he’s anti-Trump – but did he secure a presidential pardon for a crony?","body":"A leading US ethics expert said the former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who this week launched a presidential campaign aimed at taking down Donald Trump, owes the American public an explanation of why and how he secured a pardon for a powerful New Jersey Republican, issued on Trump’s last day in the White House. “We just don’t know the answer to that,” Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), said. “And I think we should.” Related: Chris Christie, ex-New Jersey governor, launches 2024 presidential run Trump is the clear Republican frontrunner to face Joe Biden next year. But Christie says Trump is not fit to return to the White House, given his scandal-plagued time in office and his incitement of the January 6 Capitol attack. Christie has said he has not spoken to Trump since before 6 January 2021, the day Trump sent supporters to the Capitol in a deadly attempt to stop the certification of his defeat by Biden. But 14 days after the attack, on Trump’s last day in power, a 143-strong list of pardons and commutations included a name supported by Christie. Alongside Trump allies Steve Bannon and Ken Kurson, and the rapper Lil Wayne, was George Gilmore, a lawyer and Republican party chair in Ocean county, New Jersey. Gilmore was indicted on federal tax charges in January 2020. He denied wrongdoing, his attorney claiming his lavish spending on collectibles was evidence of a hoarding disorder. Nonetheless, Gilmore was sentenced to a year and a day in prison and three years of supervised release, a conviction upheld on appeal that December. Gilmore avoided prison time. Announcing his pardon, the White House saluted his “important civic contributions over his career in New Jersey”. It also listed his supporters. The first two named were Christie and Bill Stepien. Stepien managed Trump’s re-election campaign. Before that, he worked in New Jersey for Christie, including when Christie narrowly won in 2009 and during his landslide re-election in 2013. By the time Christie left office, though, he and Stepien were under the shadow of the Bridgegate scandal, concerning political payback against a Democratic mayor. Notably, Christie ran for president in 2016 but failed to make an impact. Swiftly endorsing Trump, he stuck with him even after being fired from Trump’s transition, which Christie says was due to bad blood with Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and adviser. Chris Christie endorses Donald Trump for president Stepien, Politico said, saw his own career threatened by Bridgegate but “kept a lifeline of income from the [Republican] super pac GOPAC, thanks to Gilmore’s help. That connection helped secure Gilmore the Trump pardon.” Stepien also worked in the Trump White House. He is now a founding partner of a consultancy, National Public Affairs, whose website features Trump allies including Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma senator; Harriet Hageman, who defeated Liz Cheney in 2022 for her Wyoming House seat; and Ronny Jackson, a White House doctor turned Texas congressman. In February, Politico described Gilmore’s own political resurrection, including a return as Ocean county Republican chair made possible, the site said, because Gilmore “had … a key connection to Trump world”. Stepien told Politico that Gilmore would once again play a key role in elections in New Jersey: “One out of every seven votes will come out of Ocean county in the next statewide primary. So if you’re not spending time trying to build a relationship with George and his team, I have to question your strategy.” Christie, who became an analyst for ABC and wrote two books, has made his political strategy clear: he is going to take the game to Trump. Bookbinder said: “I think it’s a good thing that Christie is calling out Donald Trump on his role in inciting an insurrection and on his undercutting of democracy. For that to be coming from people who were insiders is powerful. “That said, I think Chris Christie needs to answer for his [having been] someone who was close to Trump when Trump’s abuses were very much apparent, really from the beginning, and from before Donald Trump became president, and in carrying through to the end of the presidency. “We don’t know when Christie made [or supported the pardon] request [for Gilmore]. It certainly may be that all contacts were before January 6, when Christie at least says that he cut off Trump completely. But we just don’t know the answer to that,” he added. “And I think we should, because to the extent that he is saying he was outraged by Trump’s anti-democratic abuses and had nothing to do with them, that would not be consistent with continuing to ask for favours that might seem to go around the normal pardon process. And that’s something that I think it’s appropriate for the public to have answers to.” The pardon power, Bookbinder said, is “meant to be broad, as a check on runaway prosecutorial power”. Pardons and acts of clemency as a president leaves office are common. But Trump’s pardons proved as controversial as his presidency, amid reports of aides including Rudy Giuliani seeking to profit and with those pardoned including the likes of Bannon and Roger Stone, who might otherwise have testified against Trump. Pointing to the need to lessen abuse of the pardon power, Bookbinder said: “You can’t see Donald Trump as an existential threat to democracy, which I believe he is, while also still having dealings with him and his circle. You can’t do both at once. “And so it is reasonable to ask Chris Christie if that’s what he is doing, or if that’s what he has been doing – [if he has] a good answer to that. We should, at least, have a right to know that answer.” A Christie spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.","Id":"us-news/2023/jun/08/chris-christie-anti-trump-candidate","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"Chris Christie says he’s anti-Trump – but did he secure a presidential pardon for a crony?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/08/chris-christie-anti-trump-candidate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/jun/08/chris-christie-anti-trump-candidate","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":952,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T12:00:32Z","id":"us-news/2023/jun/08/chris-christie-anti-trump-candidate","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Alarm at rightwing push to reverse clean-energy success in Texas and beyond","body":"In the scramble before the end of Texas’s legislative session last week, a must-pass bill was amended to impose new costs upon renewable energy. This came amid a barrage of anti-solar and wind power measures pushed forward by Republicans to reshape a state that has become the US’s powerhouse of clean energy. But the conservative lawmakers had help. Sections of the bill that impose new burdens upon clean energy providers were directly crafted and edited by the Texas Public Policy Foundation (or TPPF), a conservative group that has led the backlash to renewables and make what it calls “the moral case for fossil fuels”, according to a copy of the draft language seen by the Guardian. Several dozen edits were made to the bill’s amendments by Brent Bennett, a TPPF policy staffer, the document shows, and Texas lawmakers subsequently passed parts of this language along with the key TPPF desires – to impose new transmission costs on renewables and require them to source fossil fuel ‘backup’ power when the sun isn’t shining or wind isn’t blowing. The passage of the bill, which funds the ongoing operation of the Public Utility Commission of Texas, was the flagship victory for TPPF even as a raft of other Republican bills that would’ve “shut down the renewable energy industry in Texas”, as energy analyst Doug Lewin put it, faltered. The burgeoning influence of TPPF, an organization substantially funded by fossil fuel interests and publicly lauded by Greg Abbott, Texas’s Republican governor, is the catalyst to a rightwing attempt to crimp the stunning progress of renewable energy in the state, which now produces more than a quarter of all wind-powered electricity in the US. The group’s agenda is now extending far beyond Texas, bankrolling efforts to halt offshore wind turbines in Massachusetts and to prop up coal power on native American land in Arizona while spearheading efforts to crack down on sustainable finance in energy-producing states like West Virginia. “We are very influential, we are meeting with policy makers to share recommendations and we’re having success around the country,” said Jason Isaac, a former state representative and now director of TPPF’s energy initiatives. Isaac said that TPFF regularly helps craft “certain aspects” of bills in Texas related to the state’s electricity grid or environmental, social, and corporate governance (or ESG) issues. “I think conservatives are slowly but surely moving away from variable generation and towards reliable generation,” he said of the group’s quest against renewables. Isaac claimed renewables have been unfairly propped up by a “cult-like fascination” among politicians who have pursued what he called a “dangerous and deadly” agenda to reduce planet-heating emissions. Interactive The aggressive push against renewables in Texas has alarmed environmentalists who fret it will undermine the state’s nation-leading wind industry and threaten the revenues solar and wind generates for local communities and farmers. More broadly, the template used by TPPF in Texas could hobble efforts by Joe Biden’s administration to tackle the climate crisis. “We are seeing a rush of these bills attempting to wind the clock back on renewables and TPPF really are at the point of the spear on this,” said Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas. “They are transparent advocates for the fossil fuel industry and I think they pose an incredible threat to renewables. TPPF have gained incredible traction, they really are shifting the narrative in Texas. “They’ve won over the top politicians in the state, which is very dangerous. Texas is going to be critical if the US going to get to net zero emissions, so we should take this threat seriously.” TPPF’s impact can now be found thousands of miles from its base in Austin, Texas, with the group filing a lawsuit in 2021 on behalf of six east coast fishing businesses – collectively called Nantucket Residents Against Turbines – targeting a major wind farm currently under construction off the coast of Massachusetts. Slated to come online by the end of the year, Vineyard Wind will be the first major offshore wind project to be built off the US east coast. The lawsuit claimed federal agencies did not sufficiently analyze how the project, which is set to deliver enough electricity to power 400,000 homes, would impact wildlife – specifically the endangered North Atlantic right whale – and thereby violated the Endangered Species Act and slew of other environmental policies. Meghan Lapp, a seafood dealer and longtime offshore wind critic who was a plaintiff in the suit, told Reuters in 2021 that TPPF got involved in the suit at her request. As it announced its involvement in the case, the thinktank also took the unusual step of releasing a trailer called “A Heavy Wind”. The case was ultimately unsuccessful after a federal judge dismissed it last month, but the idea that wind turbines kill whales has been seized upon by conservatives, especially since December, when dozens of whales began washing up on the Atlantic coast in what the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) calls an “unusual mortality event”. Noaa has said there is no evidence that offshore wind power is killing off whales, with fishing practices, boat strikes and the climate crisis among the primary dangers to marine mammals, but congressional Republicans have called on the White House to pause offshore wind development, while Tucker Carlson, then of Fox News, aired a critical series of segments called “The Biden Whale Extinction”. The assault on renewables by TPPF and its Republican allies has stunned conservatives who remain supportive of the long-standing bipartisan enthusiasm for clean energy. The reversal has been particularly stark for Texas which, blessed with the capacious, flat terrain and amenable climate for abundant wind and solar energy, was championed as a bastion for renewables by previous Republican governors George W Bush and Rick Perry, even as they embraced the ubiquitous oil industry. More than 40% of Texas’s electricity came from carbon-free sources last year, with the state now producing more wind and solar than the next three states – California, Iowa and Oklahoma – combined. This imperious status now seems uncertain. “I don’t recognize the state sometimes anymore from our elected leaders, it’s like we are in a twilight zone where up is down and day is night,” said Matt Welch, state director of Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation. “I fear we’re losing our lead in the nation and the world as the source for clean energy advancement. It’s just amazing we’ve rolled up the welcome mat and told wind and solar operators they’re just not welcome here anymore.” The Texas Public Policy Foundation was founded in 1989 by James R Leininger, a San Antonio-based physician who made his fortune selling hospital beds, and initially focused on the issue of charter schools before branching out into other topics such as energy. The thinktank is a member of the State Policy Network, a network of far-right nonprofits across the country that fight climate-focused legislation. In 2021, the most recent year for which records are available, donations for the thinktank totaled $25.6m. Publicly available data shows that – like many State Policy Network affiliates – its largest known funder is Charles Koch, the billionaire industrialist who made his fortune from fossil fuels. Entities tied to Koch have contributed at least $8.8m to the group since 2012, according to an analysis by researcher Connor Gibson. Interactive Tax filings show that the group has received donations from fossil fuel companies including ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, but, as a nonprofit, the full extent of TPPF’s fossil fuel funding is unknown. Issac said, however, it has been “many years” since large oil firms such as Exxon have donated to TPPF as these companies now ostensibly support decarbonization and environmentally-responsible corporate governance, which conflicts with the foundation. He insisted that the foundation is committed to “free enterprise and individual liberty” and the eradication of “market distorting” subsidies, not just for renewables but also fossil fuels. But Welch said that Republican lawmakers, backed by TPPF, have ditched any ideological consistency by heaping onerous restrictions on renewable energy development on private property, in some cases attempting to impose requirements absent from oil and gas drilling, and trying to slash subsidies for the industry at the same time as offering state support for the buildout of new gas plants. One proposed bill that didn’t get sufficient backing in the latest Texas legislative session would’ve placed stringent new rules for wind and solar projects, including written permissions from neighboring property owners and setbacks of up to half a mile from the edge of a property for wind turbines. Another would’ve cut all subsidies for renewable energy. “On a Tuesday these lawmakers will be adamantly for private property rights, but on a Thursday they will want to stop the growth of renewable energy even though it’s on somebody’s private land,” Welch said, adding that TPPF was once full of “mini Milton Friedmans for years until recently, and now all of a sudden they throw that out the window. “It’s been a shocker. It’s so hypocritical,” he said. “I used to be an acolyte of TPPF but they are now driven by oil and gas billionaires who want to stop alternative forms of energy to benefit their own bottom line. They’ve sold their soul to the almighty dollar.” Renewable energy remains broadly popular with the Texas public for delivering cheap, clean power along with an injection of cash for entities such as school districts, but affection has somewhat curdled among some of the state’s Republican leadership. A devastating winter storm in 2021, which left millions of Texans without power and led to several hundred deaths, was a major accelerant of this trend. In the days following the crippling event, known as winter storm Uri, Abbott and other leading Republicans pushed the blame for the power blackouts upon renewable energy, with misleading pictures of frozen wind turbines from Europe quickly circulating social media as the supposed cause of the grid’s breakdown. Subsequent studies have made clear the primary cause of the blackouts were frozen gas pipelines and a lack of infrastructure resiliency to extreme weather, rather than renewables per se, but the perception of faulty wind and solar has stuck, eagerly fanned by TPPF. “I still believe (renewables) deserve a lot of the blame,” said Isaac. “The storm was helpful in educating people who just assumed when they flip a switch the lights come on that there are issues with grid reliability, that solar panels covered in snow don’t produce electricity.” Isaac said the foundation accepts that the climate is changing but disputes that this is harmful to people, claiming that the benefits of burning of fossil fuels “far outweighs” any negatives, including deadly air pollution, which he asserts isn’t an issue for the US and its “near natural” air quality. Scientists have, in fact, found that the climate crisis poses huge and growing risks to humanity, with airborne pollutants from burning coal, oil and gas linked to an array of different health problems. While the most severe of the anti-renewables bills pushed forward in Texas didn’t pass the legislature this year, Isaac said that TPPF remains undaunted and will continue to agitate against what he called “the false panacea of variable power”. Supporters of clean energy said they expect further battles ahead to prevent Texas’s progress in solar and wind from being unwound. “With the growth trajectory of renewable energy, TPPF can either get on the train or lay down in front of the tracks,” said Welch. “I suspect they won’t rest on their laurels. They’re going to come for renewables again and again and again.”","Id":"us-news/2023/jun/08/rightwing-backlash-reverse-clean-energy-success-texas","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"Alarm at rightwing push to reverse clean-energy success in Texas and beyond","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/08/rightwing-backlash-reverse-clean-energy-success-texas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/jun/08/rightwing-backlash-reverse-clean-energy-success-texas","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":1921,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T12:00:30Z","id":"us-news/2023/jun/08/rightwing-backlash-reverse-clean-energy-success-texas","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Threatened Saudi dissident told to live like Edward Snowden by Met police","body":"A Saudi Arabian dissident living in London was told to “emulate” the life of the US whistleblower Edward Snowden by a Metropolitan police officer, amid death threats he received after fleeing his country. Col Rabih Alenezi, 44, had been a senior official in Saudi Arabia’s security service for two decades, but sought asylum in the UK after he claimed to have been ordered to carry out human rights violations. His life was threatened for criticising the regime of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Alenezi, who carries a diplomatic passport, arrived in London in February, but doesn’t feel safe. He told the Guardian that he received an average of 50 death threats a week and feared he could be killed in the same way as Jamal Khashoggi, a vocal critic of the Saudi regime and Washington Post journalist, who was murdered inside the Saudi embassy in Istanbul in 2018. Most of the threats to his life also threaten dismemberment and are sent to his Twitter, YouTube and TikTok accounts, which Alenezi uses regularly to speak out against oppression by Prince Mohammed. He has gained a high following online and lives on donations he receives from his followers. Local media reported that a bounty of $250,000 (£200,000) had been placed on his head by the Saudi royal court. Alenezi reported these threats to the Met police at the end of March. He received an email a month later advising him not to appear on social media, but instead to model the life led by Snowden, a US National Security Agency contractor who leaked classified files to the Guardian 10 years ago. The email from a detective stated: “We have already discussed a number of safeguarding methods … the model of living you ought to emulate is that of Edward Snowdon [sic], which is something we have also discussed. I appreciate the situation that you are in, and am not underestimating the risk against you.” It is unclear what the police meant. Snowden has been living in exile in Russia since 2013, but appears online in public debate. The suggestion raises questions about the attitude of the police and their understanding of political asylum seekers, who often come to Britain believing that they will be free to speak out. Alenezi said: “I refuse to be silenced. [That is why] I left Saudi Arabia, so I could have freedom of expression.” Since leaving his country, Alenezi, who is one of the highest ranked defectors from the kingdom in recent history, has made several allegations about human rights violations he was told to carry out, including an order in 2020 by the Saudi ministry of interior to crack down on the Huwaitat tribe in Tabuk province, the location of Prince Mohammed’s pet project Neom, a planned megacity in the desert. Alenezi refused the order, but the crackdown went ahead anyway, resulting in the death of a vocal critic from the Huwaitat tribe, Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti. The order was justified on terrorism grounds, even though there was no inclusion of the protesters in the official terrorism register, according to Alenezi. Shortly after making such allegations on social media, Alenezi claimed he received a phone call in which he was invited to the Saudi embassy in London to discuss an offer of $5m in exchange for his silence. Alenezi did not go, fearing he could meet the same fate as Khashoggi. The Saudi embassy did not respond to requests for comment. At about the same time, Alenezi received death threats from a Twitter account run by a person calling themselves Fahad Bin Sattam. Posts asked the account’s 19,000 followers to hunt Alenezi down in London and provided locations identified from his social media accounts. Interactive The Guardian has seen a video in which Alenezi is forced to leave a restaurant by a man claiming he has received a call from TikTok asking Alenezi to stop posting online. Alenezi said he was then followed from the restaurant. In the email received from the Met it was confirmed that the Twitter user was operating from within Saudi Arabia. It said: “This places him outside of British legal jurisdiction, and this is a consequence of the global nature of the internet.” A Met spokesperson confirmed that they had received an allegation of malicious communications but said: “We wouldn’t comment on words that might have been exchanged between an officer and victim/complainant.” Alenezi said he followed one piece of advice provided by the police, to change hotels every few days, but he continues to feel insecure. He said: “I left to escape the atmosphere of paranoia and fear created by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman but I am still being hounded in London. I feel lonely and isolated, and this affected my psychological health greatly.” Abdullah Alaoudh, Saudi director at the Freedom Initiative, a US-based nonprofit, said: “Col Rabih’s defection marks a unique and rare event in Saudi Arabia within the police and security forces. “The Saudi government has a long history of transnational repression, of harassing, stalking, silencing, intimidating and even assassinating dissidents abroad – Alenezi is just a recent example.”","Id":"uk-news/2023/jun/08/saudi-dissident-rabih-alenezi-death-threats-met-police-edward-snowden","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"Threatened Saudi dissident told to live like Edward Snowden by Met police ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/08/saudi-dissident-rabih-alenezi-death-threats-met-police-edward-snowden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/jun/08/saudi-dissident-rabih-alenezi-death-threats-met-police-edward-snowden","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":852,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T12:00:30Z","id":"uk-news/2023/jun/08/saudi-dissident-rabih-alenezi-death-threats-met-police-edward-snowden","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"UK’s biggest banks urged to increase ‘measly’ savings rates","body":"Britain’s biggest banks need to “up their game” and stop fobbing off millions of loyal customers with “measly” savings rates, according to the head of an influential committee of MPs. MPs on the Commons Treasury committee have been investigating why, when the Bank of England interest rate has increased 12 times in a row to 4.5%, many leading banks are still offering easy access savings accounts paying less than 1%, and in some cases as little as 0.25%. They had already accused bank bosses of seemingly “taking advantage” of loyal customers, while the Financial Conduct Authority said in April that it had challenged some banks that had been miserly with their savings rate increases. The FCA warned that “onerous interventions” would be considered if it concluded its concerns were not being properly addressed. The consumer body Which? has also sounded the alarm, saying that high street banks “have been short-changing savers by paying unjustifiably low rates for years”. The Barclays Everyday Saver easy access account offers only 0.7% interest and Santander Everyday Saver pays 0.85%, while the Lloyds Bank Easy Saver is offering 0.9% unless customers have got £25,000-plus stashed away. Virgin Money’s Everyday Saver is paying just 0.25%. At the same time, some smaller players such as challenger banks and building societies are offering eye-catching rates: Saffron building society recently launched an account paying a fixed 9% rate, while Skipton building society announced one with a 7.5% rate. However, some of these high-paying accounts have a number of restrictions relating to who can sign up and how much can be saved. About 60% of household deposits are held in instant access accounts, according to the Bank of England, which said last month the passing on of interest rate rises to savers had been “unusually weak”. Harriett Baldwin MP, the chair of the Treasury committee, said that in the wake of the Bank of England’s comments, it was “clearer than ever that the nation’s biggest banks need to up their game and encourage saving”. She added: “While other products are available to those who shop around, the measly easy access rates on offer lead us to conclude that loyal customers are being squeezed to bolster bank profit margins.” Baldwin said the committee remained concerned that the “loyalty penalty” was particularly an issue for older and vulnerable customers, who may still rely on high street bank branches. Jenny Ross, the editor of Which? Money, said the MPs were “right to hold [the high street banks] to account for this”. Which? said the new “consumer duty” regime being brought in by the FCA from 31 July – which sets higher, clearer standards of protection and explicitly requires companies to put customers’ needs first – “must mean tough action against firms who continue to offer such meagre rates”. In April, the FCA said the “harm” caused to millions of loyal high street bank customers earning low interest on their savings was likely to have worsened as interest rates have risen.","Id":"money/2023/jun/08/uk-biggest-banks-urged-to-increase-measly-savings-interest-rates-bank-of-england","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webTitle":"UK’s biggest banks urged to increase ‘measly’ savings rates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/08/uk-biggest-banks-urged-to-increase-measly-savings-interest-rates-bank-of-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2023/jun/08/uk-biggest-banks-urged-to-increase-measly-savings-interest-rates-bank-of-england","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":497,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T11:54:54Z","id":"money/2023/jun/08/uk-biggest-banks-urged-to-increase-measly-savings-interest-rates-bank-of-england","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Kiss frontman Gene Simmons given tour of parliament by DUP’s Ian Paisley","body":"One styles himself as the God of Thunder.

The whale was spotted by a couple sailing 2 miles off the Cornish coast and is causing a ripple of joy among conservationists because the mammals, which can grow up to 18 metres long, are rarely seen off the far south-west of England and there is no previous modern record of one in the area at this time of year. Linda Cassidy, who spotted the humpback in Falmouth Bay during a sailing adventure with her partner, Ryan, around the UK, said it was an amazing sight. “We were sailing from Plymouth to Falmouth when we noticed some splashes ahead,” said Cassidy. “Our first thought was a jetskier – though this did seem unlikely because the water was choppy. Then we saw the fin and realised we were witnessing a whale.” The humpback appeared on the starboard side of their 11-metre boat, Crystal Star, and then popped up on the port side. Cassidy tried to keep her camera still to film it but the footage was a little shaky because of the rough conditions and her excitement over what she was recording. She managed to capture the whale slapping its tail on the surface of the water and then breaching. “That was its finale,” she said. “It was an incredible sight to witness this beautiful creature, and totally unexpected. At best we were hoping to see some dolphins so this was a real treat, a great experience.” There has been a steady increase in the number of humpback whale sightings over the past five years off Cornwall. So far this year about 10 different humpbacks have been recorded by the Cornwall Wildlife Trust passing through Cornish waters, but there has only been one previous summer sighting: in August 2019, off Lamorna in the far west of Cornwall. Abby Crosby, a marine conservation officer for the trust, said: “This is a very special sighting as humpbacks are usually sighted here in Cornwall only sporadically in the winter months. To get a sighting like this in early summer is brilliant. It may indicate the species is recovering. I see it as a wake-up call to remind us how impressive our Cornish seas are.” The trust said the humpbacks, which can weigh as much as 40 tonnes and live for 80 to 90 years, did seem to be making a comeback in UK waters. Sightings are more common off Shetland and the Hebrides and they are also increasingly being spotted in the northern parts of the North Sea. Humpback whales undertake some of the longest migrations of any mammal, feasting on small fish and krill in cooler waters and then travelling to tropical seas to give birth. Crosby said the tail-slapping seen in the video may be a form of communication, or a way of stunning prey. Some whales that are repeatedly seen passing through Cornish waters in the winter have been identified and given names including Cream Tea, Kevin, Snowy and Morvil – Cornish for whale. There is also one called Abby, named after Crosby. And a whale called Helen has been spotted in waters off Cornwall, Russia and the Dominican Republic.","Id":"uk-news/2023/jun/08/special-humpback-whale-sighting-off-coast-of-cornwall-delights-conservationists","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"‘Special’ humpback whale sighting off Cornwall coast delights conservationists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/08/special-humpback-whale-sighting-off-coast-of-cornwall-delights-conservationists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/jun/08/special-humpback-whale-sighting-off-coast-of-cornwall-delights-conservationists","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":557,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T11:35:35Z","id":"uk-news/2023/jun/08/special-humpback-whale-sighting-off-coast-of-cornwall-delights-conservationists","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Dining across the divide: ‘Most things he said were anecdotal, whereas I was trying to present stats’","body":"Leon, 42, Oxford Occupation Coordinator at a food charity Voting record Labour “when they have a genuine leftwing candidate, otherwise I register a protest vote”.

The pretty, historic town of Sombor, where Jokić grew up, is tucked into the northwestern pocket of Serbia, flush against the borders with Croatia and Hungary; the Hungarian, Habsburg, Ottoman and Austrian empires have all, at various points over the past half-millennium, laid claim to it. Jokić, perhaps fittingly given his origins, has emerged over this postseason as the NBA’s ultimate border-hopper: a center with the touch of a guard, a prodigious scorer who’s better as a passer, the embodiment of total basketball, infinitely adaptable, positionless but always in position, a crossroads in human form. Related: Nikola Jokić’s historic night lifts Denver to Game 3 win over Miami in NBA finals As Denver tightened their grip on the finals with a coolly commanding Game 3 win in Miami on Wednesday night, a talent that once threatened to go unrewarded with the hard currency of titles has come thrillingly into mint. Jokić’s numbers – 32 points, 21 rebounds, 10 assists – made him the first player ever to post a 30-20-10 game in the NBA finals. But most impressive was the way in which he accumulated these figures, with a freedom and variety that captured the best of his childhood heroes. Growing up in Serbia in the early years of this century, Jokić would spend hours on YouTube watching his favorite NBA players. “I watched Magic because of his passing, and Hakeem because of his post moves, and Jordan because he is Jordan,” Jokic wrote in 2016, a year after joining the Denver Nuggets as a second-round draft pick. The two-time MVP is clomping through these finals with the vision and improvisational sizzle of Magic, Hakeem the Dream’s size-defying touch and footwork, and Jordan’s on-court omnipresence and invincibility, his sheer weight of numbers and aura of statistical destiny. A claim for historical greatness is convincingly being assembled. Schedule Best-of-seven series. All times EDT. Thu 1 Jun Game 1: Nuggets 104, Heat 93 Sun 4 Jun Game 2: Heat 111, Nuggets 108 Wed 7 Jun Game 3: Nuggets 109, Heat 94 Fri 9 Jun Game 4: Nuggets at Heat, 8.30pm (ABC) Mon 12 Jun Game 5: Heat at Nuggets, 8.30pm (ABC) Thu 15 Jun Game 6: Nuggets at Heat, 8.30pm (ABC) * Sun 18 Jun Game 7: Heat at Nuggets, 8pm (ABC) * * if necessary The history of the NBA is replete with examples of small men who played against type to impose themselves in the paint: Spud Webb, Muggsy Bogues, Allen Iverson. Jokić is the rare big man who plays against type. Although he’s close to seven feet tall, his greatest skills are those more typically associated with players many inches his inferior: passing, dribbling, ball handling, court awareness. Instead of playing “above the rim” like someone of his immensity normally would, he operates below it; he plays above and around the heads of his opponents, across their backs, through their legs, under arms raised haplessly in defense. The staggering stats Jokić puts up, game to game, will always be the alpha of his claim to greatness, but it’s his refusal to do the things that basketball “bigs” are usually expected to – muscle up in the paint, wait for the ball to come to him, dunk – that form that claim’s omega, that make him so uniquely charming. If Game 1 of these finals was a passing clinic and Game 2 highlighted his scoring touch, then Game 3 offered a stage for Jokić to demonstrate his mastery of game management. Whatever his team needed, Jokić was on hand to provide it, varying his output in line with the game’s fluctuations in momentum. Through a tight opening quarter he was a defensive monster, controlling the boards with bulky authority and starving the Heat of second balls; in the second quarter he began to take control on offense, deploying his full range of spins, hooks, fakes and dinks – off both hands – in the paint. But it was in the second half that the true shape of this masterpiece became apparent. The Nuggets have struggled with concentration throughout these finals, fading at the end of Game 1 to make the ultimate scoreline far closer than the game felt in real time, then switching off in the final quarter of Game 2 to let Miami even up the series. Towards the end of Wednesday’s third quarter, as the Nuggets began to pull away from their opponents, it briefly seemed as if Jimmy Butler might inspire the Heat to sneak back into the game. Jokić calmly took the ball in hand and sank his first three-pointer of the night. The sight of the great man letting fly from distance, his hands throwing tall in high Larry Bird-style, immediately galvanized those in blue. The Nuggets embarked on a lightning scoring spree; from there, the game’s ultimate direction seemed subject to little doubt. Denver’s Nikola Jokić has recorded a playoff-record 10 triple-doubles during this postseason (so far). Photograph: Wilfredo Lee/AP Jokić is averaging 31 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists a game so far this postseason. There’s little doubt he is the best player on the planet right now, an achievement that never ceases to amaze whenever you catch a glimpse of the man – his head pushed forward, the shoulders round and mouth gaping, that ham of a nose sniffing out routes to the basket. One of the world’s greatest athletes is now one of its least athletic-looking. Jokić’s body is like a mattress – blocky and enormous but somehow soft – and he has the upper arms of a management consultant; there is nothing chiseled or ripped about his physique. No matter how many accolades and rings he goes on to win in his career – and there are surely many more to come – Jokić will never, I imagine, stop seeming like a man who’s wandered onto the basketball court by accident on his way to a family barbecue. Even in peak form Jokić’s machinations on the court seem somehow improbable. The NBA’s contemporary greats all have a signature style of movement. LeBron James thunders, James Harden ambles, Steph Curry bounces, Kevin Durant glides, Ben Simmons sits. Jokic happens – awkwardly, implausibly, and, it sometimes seems, unintentionally, but with a kind of inevitability. At times his limbs seem to get ahead of him like baseball bats spilling from a bag; at others there’s a kind of patterned tranquility about his movements that recalls stop motion animation. Many of his shots are taken off balance, with a single hand, from the waist, above the head, or in a position that suggests that Jokić is about to hit the deck. Somehow, though, it all works. Surprise is the key to his mastery. Unorthodox, off-kilter and on fire, Jokić is the most delightfully effective gallumpher that basketball has ever seen. If Curry is the master of the half court, a long-range scoring threat from the moment the ball passes the halfway line, Jokic is the master of the full court: a man who can do it all, while never seeming on the cusp of doing anything. To observe him in full flow is like watching a pickup truck do ballet. Nikola Jokić looks on during the second quarter of Wednesday night’s Game 3 of the NBA finals.

Jamal Murray – who grabbed his own triple-double in Game 3 – is finally free of the ACL troubles that stalled his ascent in recent seasons; together, he and Jokić represent the best big-small combination since Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito in Twins. And the caliber of the supporting cast has improved, with Aaron Gordon in particular adding an elite presence in defense. With LeBron set to retire, Curry – however prolific he remains – approaching his late 30s, and the glamour franchises from the coastal population centers all cycling through some version of buying a theoretical James Harden to fix all their problems, the low-key, undramatic Nuggets – assuming they can retain their playing core – seem ideally placed to become Golden State-grade fixtures of the postseason. Standing at the center of it all will be Jokić, this origami redwood, the man with the gift for forcing the game while never seeming to be in a hurry. There’s something refreshingly adult about a man who moved to the US with his brothers at 20, married his hometown girlfriend, and thinks social media is “a waste of time”. Jokić is a man, seemingly, untempted by distraction. Family, basketball and horses are his great passions. At 28, he still has plenty of time left in his playing career. Nothing seems likely to stop him from delicately obliterating his rivals and dominating the NBA for years to come.","Id":"sport/blog/2023/jun/08/nikola-jokic-nba-finals-denver-nuggets","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"A pickup truck doing ballet: Nikola Jokić is making the NBA finals his masterpiece","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/08/nikola-jokic-nba-finals-denver-nuggets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/08/nikola-jokic-nba-finals-denver-nuggets","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport","wordcount":1356,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T11:28:50Z","id":"sport/blog/2023/jun/08/nikola-jokic-nba-finals-denver-nuggets","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Eurozone sinks into recession as cost of living crisis takes toll","body":"The eurozone slipped into recession in the first three months of the year, after official figures were revised to show the bloc’s economy shrank as the rising cost of living weighed on consumer spending. Figures from Eurostat, the EU’s statistical agency, showed gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.1% in the first quarter of 2023 and the final three months of 2022 after revisions to earlier estimates. A technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Previous estimates suggested the single-currency bloc had narrowly avoided recession with zero growth in both quarters. The updated figures showed the wider EU swerved a recession after GDP rose by 0.1% in the first three months of the year, after a contraction of 0.2% in the final quarter of 2022. The UK avoided entering a recession at the start of the year, while growth in the US also remained positive. However, GDP volumes in the eurozone and the EU are more than 2% higher than the level recorded in the final quarter of 2019 before the Covid pandemic struck – unlike in the UK, where the economy remains 0.5% smaller. Households across the eurozone have come under pressure from rising living costs after the Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered a sharp increase in gas prices, fuelling the highest rates of inflation since the foundation of the single-currency bloc. With consumers under pressure from the higher energy and food prices, household final consumption dragged down GDP across the euro area by 0.1 percentage points, after a larger 1 percentage-point drop in the previous quarter. Several eurozone economies were in recession or came close to recording two consecutive quarters of decline, including Germany, the EU’s largest economy. France recorded close to zero growth, with flatlining growth in the fourth quarter and a modest increase of 0.2% in the first three months of 2023. Growth across the 20-country single currency area was, however, also dragged down by Ireland, where GDP fell by 4.6% in the first quarter of this year. However, economists have questioned whether the country’s GDP figures reflect the performance of the Irish economy. Inflation across the eurozone has fallen sharply in recent months, with the annual rate cooling from a peak of 10.6% last autumn to reach 6.1% in May – fuelling speculation that the European Central Bank could be near the end of its cycle of interest rate increases to tame rapid growth in prices. Diego Iscaro, the head of European economics at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said evidence of a technical recession was unlikely to dissuade the ECB from raising interest rates at its policy meeting next week. “We see rates rising by 25 basis points. However, the figures reinforce our view that, while policy rates will rise further in the short term, they are nearing their peak,” he said. “With the effect of higher interest rates still to be fully felt, we project economic activity to remain sluggish during the rest of 2023.”","Id":"business/2023/jun/08/eurozone-sinks-into-recession-as-cost-of-living-crisis-takes-toll","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webTitle":"Eurozone sinks into recession as cost of living crisis takes toll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/08/eurozone-sinks-into-recession-as-cost-of-living-crisis-takes-toll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jun/08/eurozone-sinks-into-recession-as-cost-of-living-crisis-takes-toll","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":495,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T11:16:47Z","id":"business/2023/jun/08/eurozone-sinks-into-recession-as-cost-of-living-crisis-takes-toll","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"The CNN chief messed up in many ways. Only one of them was fatal","body":"It was one of those pieces of news that was simultaneously stunning and utterly expected: Chris Licht was out of CNN. No doubt, the chairman and CEO had been embattled, almost from the start of his tumultuous year-long reign. He took over from Jeff Zucker, who – whatever his faults – was popular with the staff because he understood what they did and supported it. Soon after arriving, Licht went on an ill-advised apology tour on Capitol Hill in which he sent the message that Republican lawmakers – even those who had supported overturning the 2020 election or downplayed the 6 January 2021 insurrection – would be welcome and treated well on the network. Related: States haven’t stopped spying on their citizens, post-Snowden - they’ve just got sneakier | Heather Brooke With clear orders from above, the former CBS executive aimed the cable network’s coverage at some sort of imaginary middle ground between Fox News on the right and MSNBC on the left. There may be a middle in American politics, but cable news – which panders to its audience’s most extreme views – isn’t the place to find it. No, cable news is where viewers go to get their outrage on. More important, aiming for the middle is extremely dangerous for democracy when there’s a party – the Republicans, of course – in the grip of those intent on dissolving democratic norms. So, it didn’t start off well. Then three things happened, any one of which might have been fatal. Licht provided Donald Trump a “town hall” program last month, to be aired live, meaning that the former president’s inevitable and endless lies would be aired live, too. It was a bad decision, poorly executed, which played out disastrously. Meanwhile, ratings tanked. CNN, which only rarely has led the way among the three main cable-news networks, bumped along at the bottom of the sea floor. Ratings reached historic lows. And finally, just weeks ago, the Atlantic published a devastating 15,000-word profile, for which the reporter Tim Alberta got wide-ranging access to Licht and many others at CNN. The piece hit hard. It documented how Licht’s decision-making was misguided, seeming to lack a moral core of journalistic mission, despite the lip service paid to the importance of reporting. And it showed his disconnect with the editorial staff; he was both distant, with an office far from the journalists, and intrusive, making radical personnel moves that played out poorly and engendered an atmosphere of fear and mistrust. “The thing that struck me was that Licht seemed to be operating on slogans, not actual ideas and didn’t seem to recognize the difference between the two,” observed Jelani Cobb, dean of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, after reading Alberta’s article. And Alberta’s detailed chronicling of Licht’s missteps was astonishing, Cobb told me in text messages. “Just the accretion of absurdities to the point where you’re like, ‘surely, this can’t all be true.’ And at the same time, it’s like of course, this all seems logical.” Particularly disturbing were the decisions involving the town hall, especially the way CNN allowed far-right Republicans – Trump’s cult members – to dominate the audience, which was supposed to be made up of ordinary Republican voters and undecided ones. But it’s possible – likely, even – that Licht would have survived all of this if it weren’t for the one thing that really mattered: the numbers. Ratings, network value and profitability are the coin of the realm in corporatized cable news, and to a large extent, in mainstream media writ large. “Licht managed to alienate everybody at CNN and people might think giving a magazine profile access was fatally stupid, but my experience of the media industry says all of this would have been irrelevant to a boss’s longevity if he had made ratings go up instead of down,” observed the Los Angeles Times reporter Matt Pearce. If Licht’s ham-handed moves and his commitment to giving equal time to liars and insurrection apologists had “worked” – that is, if ratings had soared, profits risen and value been restored – nothing else wouldn’t have mattered a whit. It’s never good to have “lost the room”, as CNN’s Oliver Darcy described in the Reliable Sources newsletter. It’s never good to have used a powerful platform to erode democracy and certainly no boss’s boss likes a negative, buzzed-about profile in a national magazine. But, sadly, these things would have been deemed tolerable if Licht’s efforts had “worked”. But they didn’t and so he’s out. (“Can you hear the champagne popping?” one CNN journalist asked a Washington Post reporter.) Perhaps the biggest cheeses at CNN have learned the right lessons: that you can’t “both sides” your way into ratings success. That there is no vast political middle just waiting to be entranced by performative neutrality. And, most of all, that good journalism has nothing to do with sucking up to would-be authoritarians but rather it demands brave truth-telling. There’s little evidence that these will be the takeaways from this debacle. But it sure would be pretty to think so.

The low birth rate effects of some PFAS have been previously established, but the study tracked 1,400 kids and found higher BMIs and more incidences of obesity in those ages two to five. The “low birth weight-high obesity risk paradox” was previously associated with tobacco smoke exposure during fetal development. “Something similar is going on with PFAS,” said Joe Braun, a Brown University researcher and study co-author. Related: Chemical industry used big tobacco’s tactics to conceal evidence of PFAS risks PFAS are a class of about 15,000 chemicals often used to make products resistant to water, stains and heat. The compounds are ubiquitous, and linked at low levels of exposure to cancer, thyroid disease, kidney dysfunction, birth defects, autoimmune disease and other serious health problems. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally degrade in the environment. A recent review of published research found PFAS in umbilical cord blood in all approximately 30,000 samples collectively checked in the studies. Though previous research found evidence suggesting the chemicals are linked to obesity early and later in life, including some research from the new study’s authors, the findings were generally inconclusive. The authors say the new research is more definitive because it included a larger sample size, greater geographic coverage, longer timespan and a wider range of exposure levels. As with tobacco smoke exposure, babies who are born underweight due to PFAS exposure can experience a rapid catch-up in weight, but not height, and the weight gain happens earlier than for children who will be a normal weight, Braun said. The precise reason PFAS cause these issues is not known for certain, said Jamie Liu, a Brown researcher and study co-author, but she added she suspected the chemicals affect DNA methylation. The methylation process is related to how the body produces cells, which all have the same DNA. Methylation is part of the mechanism that creates different cells – it determines which cell is an eye cell and which is a kidney cell, for example. During prenatal development, DNA methylation is one of the “switches that tells the body ‘this is how life is going to be on the outside’”, Braun said. The authors last year examined markers of DNA methylation in white blood cells and found PFAS exposure seemed to change how the body metabolizes energy from birth up to 12 years of age, which could affect growth. “PFAS seem to have a programming effect … that lasted for up to 12 years,” Braun said. Overall, the research found about a 12% increase in the likelihood of obesity among PFAS-exposed fetuses. Those who are exposed can mitigate the effects later in life through regular exercise, Braun said, but it is difficult for mothers to protect themselves and their fetuses because PFAS are so widely used. The US government estimates the chemicals are in 98% of Americans’ blood, and they often have long half-lives, so PFAS from an exposure years before a pregnancy could still harm a fetus. But, broadly speaking, people can take some steps to reduce PFAS exposure, Braun said. That includes filtering water – the chemicals are thought to be contaminating drinking water for more than 200 million Americans. Indoor dust is another major exposure route, and using a vacuum cleaner that has a Hepa filter can remove contaminants from the indoor environment, Braun said. Food represents perhaps the most significant exposure route, in part because the chemicals are frequently used in food packaging. Eating fresh foods that are not in packaging and pursuing a balanced diet could be beneficial, Braun added. “Those are probably the three best things you can do to hedge your bets,” he said.","Id":"environment/2023/jun/08/forever-chemicals-pfas-low-birth-weight-obesity-research","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webTitle":"‘Forever chemicals’ exposure can lead to low birth weight and obesity in later life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/forever-chemicals-pfas-low-birth-weight-obesity-research","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jun/08/forever-chemicals-pfas-low-birth-weight-obesity-research","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":639,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T11:00:05Z","id":"environment/2023/jun/08/forever-chemicals-pfas-low-birth-weight-obesity-research","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Protesters to march on White House as anger mounts over Appalachia pipeline","body":"Protesters are set to descend upon the White House on Thursday under smoky skies amid growing anger among climate activists at Joe Biden for allowing a controversial gas pipeline in Appalachia to be fast-tracked. Several hundred protesters are expected to gather in Washington to demand Biden “reclaim his climate legacy” by blocking the Mountain Valley pipeline, a 300-mile pipeline that will bring fracked gas from West Virginia to southern Virginia. Organizers said they had ordered N95 masks to help protect protesters amid the air quality alerts linked to the Canadian wildfires. “They’ll be risking arrest under skies filled with smoke from wildfires fueled by the growing climate crisis,” said organizer Jamie Henn of Fossil Free Media. A reporter just asked me if we were going to cancel the big Mountain Valley Pipeline protest at the White House tomorrow because of wildfire smoke. Answer: no, this is *exactly* why we have to take these sorts of actions. Join us. https://t.co/VHC7A0m6t0 — Jamie Henn (@jamieclimate) June 7, 2023 The Mountain Valley pipeline project has been enmeshed in legal challenges for years due to opposition from grassroots groups and landowners but the deal passed by Congress to raise the US’s debt ceiling, signed by Biden over the weekend, singles out the pipeline as being “required in the national interest” and therefore should be allowed to proceed, shielded from any future judicial review. Related: I love electric vehicles – and was an early adopter. But increasingly I feel duped | Rowan Atkinson The expediting of the pipeline provoked outrage from activists as well as some Democratic allies of Biden, with Tim Kaine, the senator from Virginia, complaining that he “strongly opposes” the decision to “green-light this pipeline without normal administrative and judicial review and ignore the voices of Virginians”. Protesters have already voiced their displeasure directly to Senator Joe Manchin, the conservative West Virginia Democrat and key swing Senate vote who was instrumental in the pipeline’s inclusion in the debt deal. About two dozen protesters interrupted a speech by Manchin at an event on Tuesday by storming the stage and chanting, “Dirty deal, MVP, Manchin, you are killing me!” Manchin, who has received more money from the gas pipeline industry than any other senator, has said that the project is vital to lower energy costs for Americans. “America is blessed with an ocean of energy under our feet, and our oil and natural gas can be produced cleaner than virtually anywhere else in the world,” the senator said. The Biden administration, meanwhile, has insisted that the pipeline would probably have gone ahead anyway, regardless of the debt deal. However, organizers of the White House protest say they are dismayed at Biden’s acquiescence to the pipeline, which follows previous decisions by the administration to allow the Willow oil drilling project in Alaska and a buildout of gas export facilities on the Gulf of Mexico coast. The International Energy Agency has made clear that there can be no new fossil fuel infrastructure built if the world is to avoid disastrous global heating. “I’m just so disappointed. It feels like President Biden is selling out. He has pushed so many fossil fuel projects in the last six months that I just can’t believe it,” said Crystal Cavalier, co-founder of 7 Directions of Service, an Indigenous environmental justice group that has been campaigning against the pipeline for the past five years. “They say this pipeline is for national security but it’s just protecting the money and investments of the developers. I hope President Biden hears us, stops these archaic policies and starts listening to people. “He said there would be no more fossil fuel permitting and he just keeps breaking his promises. They are making us into a sacrifice zone and they really have to stop.” Cavalier listed a litany of objections to the pipeline, such as its potential contamination of the hundreds of rivers, streams and wetlands it crosses, including well drinking water, along with the disturbance of Native American burial sites and increased air pollution suffered by low-income communities along the route of the project. Protesters show their disapproval outside the Brooklyn home of Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader. Photograph: Sarah Yenesel/EPA Fears of an environmental disaster emanating from the pipeline have been heightened by the project’s patchy record, with hundreds of clean water violations recorded across West Virginia and Virginia since it was first conceived nearly a decade ago. Last year, a gas storage well overseen by Equitrans Midstream Corporation, operators of the Mountain Valley pipeline, leaked more than 1bn cubic ft of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere for 13 days before being plugged. Many of the planned sections of the new pipeline, meanwhile, may have corroded during the long wait for its completion. The project will lead to between 6m and 89m tons of extra planet-heating emissions should it go ahead, depending on conflicting estimates as to its impact. The pipeline’s operator has insisted it has followed best environmental practices and on Monday requested that a federal appeals court toss out a legal challenge to the project, arguing that the debt ceiling bill had rendered the case moot. Thomas Karam, chief executive of Equitrans, said that the project “has gone through more environmental review and scrutiny than any natural gas pipeline project in US history” and should be allowed to go ahead. Mountain Valley only has 20 miles of pipeline left to lay before the project is completed, and it appears that Manchin’s long ambition to see it finished may be in sight. Opponents, though, insist the administration can still find a way to stymie it. “Even if some of these permits are issued and initially shielded from judicial review, that’s not necessarily the end of the line,” said Jason Rylander, senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, who said that the pipeline still has to cross some difficult terrain, including areas of national forest, that will require permits. Barry Rabe, an expert in environmental policy at the University of Michigan, said that with no plan set forward by Congress to shift away from gas or build new networks of power lines to transport clean electricity, fights similar to the Mountain Valley pipeline are likely to continue. “We are in a transition, but we are still producing and shipping and exporting gas,” he said. “With the Inflation Reduction Act we’ve taken a huge step in terms of incentives but it will only go so far. We have no carbon price, no ban on oil or gas production, nothing like they have in the European Union. The US is really playing catch-up.”","Id":"environment/2023/jun/08/biden-white-house-mountain-valley-pipeline-protesters","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webTitle":"Protesters to march on White House as anger mounts over Appalachia pipeline","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/biden-white-house-mountain-valley-pipeline-protesters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jun/08/biden-white-house-mountain-valley-pipeline-protesters","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":1015,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T11:00:04Z","id":"environment/2023/jun/08/biden-white-house-mountain-valley-pipeline-protesters","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Barbados fights Big Sugar for the survival of its people","body":"The beaches are white sand, cruise ships meander through its warm azure waters and Rihanna is its global champion. But there is major trouble in Barbados’s 167 square miles of paradise. You could call it obesity, you could call it heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure. Or you could call it the postcolonial predations of Big Food and Big Sugar. Barbados, like other small island developing states, is fighting for its people’s survival. On this beautiful island, people wander daily into danger, swinging two-litre flasks of sugary drinks such as Coca-Cola as they step out of their cars, buying local fast food from the back of a van for lunch and queueing at Kentucky Fried Chicken or the local chain Chefette in the evening. The blessings of the modern convenience world have been visited upon small islands, with the result that more than half their people are dying prematurely from heart and lung conditions, cancer, diabetes and other non-communicable diseases. Blame is being laid at the door of the food industry. The world’s 57 small island developing states, or SIDS, as the UN collectively calls them, have particular vulnerabilities. They cannot grow enough fresh food for their populations and, as the climate crisis worsens, water is scarcer and storms wipe out entire fields of crops every year. So they are reliant on importing their food: for some islands as much as 90% of it. And much of what they import is ultra-processed food, high in calories with very little nutritional value. This month, the World Health Organization will convene a ministerial meeting of small-island states in Barbados to forge a united response to killer non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and mental health. Barbados suffers the consequences of a high-salt, high-sugar diet. Photograph: Sarah Boseley The problems in Barbados are rooted in colonialism and slavery. People labouring on the sugar plantations were given the rejected parts of pigs – the tails, the ears, the feet – while the landowners ate or exported the lean meat. Such fatty food, heavily salted, seasoned and pickled for taste, has become the traditional Saturday staple, called pudding (sweet potato mash) and souse. If that early diet taught a love of salt, the sugar cane may have nurtured the taste for very sweet food that is also evident in Barbados today. Even coconut and peanuts come sweetened. The historian Sir Hilary Beckles, vice chancellor to the University of the West Indies, has demanded reparations. “Britain left behind a pandemic of chronic diseases. The hypertension, the diabetic pandemic collectively have constituted a threat to the existence of Caribbean society,” Beckles told Jamaica’s newspaper the Gleaner in 2020. Barbados and Jamaica had become the amputation capitals of the world, he said, as the taste for sugar fuelled the rise of type 2 diabetes. The human toll of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is huge and rising. These illnesses end the lives of approximately 41 million of the 56 million people who die every year – and three quarters of them are in the developing world. NCDs are simply that; unlike, say, a virus, you can’t catch them. Instead, they are caused by a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors. The main types are cancers, chronic respiratory illnesses, diabetes and cardiovascular disease – heart attacks and stroke. Approximately 80% are preventable, and all are on the rise, spreading inexorably around the world as ageing populations and lifestyles pushed by economic growth and urbanisation make being unhealthy a global phenomenon. NCDs, once seen as illnesses of the wealthy, now have a grip on the poor. Disease, disability and death are perfectly designed to create and widen inequality – and being poor makes it less likely you will be diagnosed accurately or treated. Investment in tackling these common and chronic conditions that kill 71% of us is incredibly low, while the cost to families, economies and communities is staggeringly high. In low-income countries NCDs – typically slow and debilitating illnesses – are seeing a fraction of the money needed being invested or donated. Attention remains focused on the threats from communicable diseases, yet cancer death rates have long sped past the death toll from malaria, TB and HIV/Aids combined. 'A common condition' is a Guardian series reporting on NCDs in the developing world: their prevalence, the solutions, the causes and consequences, telling the stories of people living with these illnesses. Tracy McVeigh, editor Not everybody agrees with that diagnosis, but there is no doubt today’s Barbadian diet is unhealthy. Fried fishcakes from a roadside stall for breakfast, lunch of macaroni pie loaded with a vast amount of cheese. Mac pie is also offered as a side dish with other meals such as fried chicken or fried fish with chips. Cake shops sell as snacks muffins three times the size of those in the UK, heavily sweetened and sugar-coated. Bread is mostly white and denuded of nutrients. Lack of exercise doesn’t help. The climate means it’s hot to jog, but although nowhere is far from a beach, many Barbadians cannot swim. “The sea has no back door,” grandmothers used to tell children. And the damaging culture they have adopted comes from wealthy America, where the car is king. There are very few bikes on the Bajan roads. Post-slavery, people in Caribbean islands were still physically active, working in agriculture, and eating a healthier diet, says Dr Kenneth Connell of the University of the West Indies, a hypertension specialist and vice president of the Healthy Caribbean Coalition (HCC). “Then modernity kicked in, they became more industrialised,” with Trinidad and Jamaica ahead of the rest. “And then there was this kind of paradox where modernity that was supposed to bring a more affluent and comfortable lifestyle, brought with it an unhealthy lifestyle. The rates of diabetes in Barbados have made it one of the amputation capitals of the world. Photograph: Courtesy of Barbados Diabetes Foundation “But unlike other territories where this was slowly happening, I’m not sure the Caribbean realised at an early enough stage where our environment was becoming unhealthy. And so for instance, not walking became something to brag about. I don’t have to walk to church, you know, I have a vehicle, or I don’t have to eat food coming from a garden because I can go to the supermarket and buy processed foods.” His generation, he said, was totally influenced by the US “enjoying the convenience of the KFC because it was on television and going to this thing called a drive thru. You don’t even have to get out of your vehicle, so you can walk less.” Sir Henry Fraser, former professor of medicine and founding director of the leading research centre on chronic diseases in the Caribbean, was involved with a study published in the mid-90s comparing rates of hypertension (high blood pressure) in black populations from West Africa with those from the Caribbean and from Chicago. “What became very clear was that there were two amazing trends for obesity and hypertension, from very low incidences in West Africa, through Jamaica, St Lucia, Barbados, to a peak in Chicago. People got fatter and fatter as they moved west and the hypertension went up in sync. So there was a huge relationship with obesity, but probably an even bigger relationship with modern society. “The changes in the Caribbean were quite dramatic. As they went through the era of the 60s, lifestyles changed dramatically, hotels were built, people stopped working in agriculture.” Students line up at a Chefette restaurant, a local fast food outlet in Barbados. Photograph: Tryphosa Ho/Alamy There are now 15 Chefette outlets in Barbados. KFC has 12 stores, or more than four for every 100,000 people – only the Cayman Islands and Trinidad and Tobago have a higher ratio. The supermarkets are expensive and the shelves are loaded with imported Spam and other tinned meat, salty snacks, sweetened tinned fruit and highly sweetened breakfast cereals. In St Lucia, the Waitrose Essentials line was on display, from sweetcorn to frozen roast potatoes to ice-cream – at higher prices even than in the UK. In Barbados, 40% of people over 25 are hypertensive and more than 20% have type 2 diabetes – in the UK, the respective proportions are about 30% and 10%. “We have a massive NCD burden,” says Dr Arthur Phillips, the government’s senior medical officer of health with responsibility for NCDs. Prof Karl Theodore, director of the Health Economics Unit at the University of the West Indies, based in Trinidad and Tobago, has estimated that NCDs cost Barbados $375m (£150m) annually, or 3% of GDP. He predicts the illnesses could drain the Caribbean region of as much as 10% of GDP. Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados, has made the NCDs a government development priority. It’s no longer just a matter for the Ministry of Health and Wellness. “People are getting diabetes, getting their limbs cut off. We need to raise taxes. The minister of finance says I didn’t sign up for this. But we say this is a drain on economic activity,” says Phillips. In 2015, the government introduced a 10% tax on sugary drinks. Coca-Cola, the biggest producer of sugar-sweetened beverages on the island, asked why the government was not instead just taxing sugar and promoting physical activity. “Then they said if you do it, we will pull out of Barbados,” said Phillips. The prime minister refused to meet the company. The tax came in and weekly sales of sugar-sweetened drinks dropped by an estimated 4.3%. In 2022, the tax was increased to 20%. This time a coalition of companies arrived for talks and launched an advertising campaign. Billboards on bus stops now declare: “Balance what you eat, drink and do.” In other words, says Phillips, “burn it off”. He knows that in Barbados, where 43% of adults and 82% of adolescents take no exercise, that isn’t going to happen. Corporate health messaging ‘plays into the idea of individual responsibility, as opposed to a supportive environment being important’. Photograph: Sarah Boseley Coca-Cola says it wants to be part of the solution and is partnering with the government now, offering training for small shops and distributors and developing a calorie-counting app for the Caribbean – an initiative that has raised eyebrows. “It plays into the idea that all calories are created equal, which is not true,” says Phillips. “It plays into the idea of individual responsibility as the key plank, as opposed to a supportive environment being important. It’s saying: ‘It’s up to you, we’ve given you a counter. So your job is just to look at everything you eat and then if there’s something wrong with you, it’s your fault.’” Mottley has asked the health ministry to look at the possibility of a salt tax, which would be a first in the Caribbean. But the bigger battle Phillips and colleagues are fighting is over food labelling. The HCC has been pushing for black octagonal warning signs on the fronts of packages, stating in alarming capitals: “HIGH IN SUGAR”, “HIGH IN SALT” or “HIGH IN FATS”. It works in Chile. The food industry is strongly opposed to such a move. The Caricom Private Sector Organization (CPSO) commissioned a study that suggested detailed nutritional traffic-light-style labels were better than the stark warnings. “It’s No 1 in the playbook of the tobacco industry: how do we counter the research with our own research?” says Maisha Hutton, executive director of the HCC, which is funded by Bloomberg. Tobacco companies are excluded from governmental discussions. So far, the food industry is staying at the table. Its argument has always been that everybody has to eat. The CPSO is represented in the labelling negotiations at the regional intergovernmental organisation Caricom, which have been taking place since 2018. In the latest vote, six out of nine governments were in favour of the octagonal warnings, but it will take 75% to trigger change. Some countries are concerned for their homegrown industries. In Trinidad and Tobago, SM Jaleel makes Busta and Chubby drinks for the region. Jamaica has its own processed foods industry. Neither country voted for the warning labels, although Jamaica’s health minister, Christopher Tufton, was strongly in favour, against the position of the island’s ministry of commerce. Heavy alcohol use is also clearly a risk factor in mental and physical health, but there are few sanctions against rum manufactured in the Caribbean. Barbados does not even have a breathalyser test or blood alcohol concentration limit for drivers. Changing children’s diets … the minister for health, Sonia Browne. Photograph: Sarah Boseley Barbados’s minister for health and wellness, Sonia Browne, says the government has been in talks with Coca-Cola and Chefette, which in principle express willingness to help. But Chefette is entrenched across Barbados: playgrounds at every store, a toy with every meal and sponsorship and sales at school sports events. Browne says tackling this will be “the hardest thing”. Even in the countryside, there is Chefette, Burger King, Little Caesar (“the saltiest thing”) and Subway. “All these things are now situated in St Philip, which was unheard of because traditionally St Philip was rural. This is where you get the sweet potato, and people share the cassava and bread fruits. Now they share Chefette snack boxes. So this will be something that we really have to figure out how to tackle and hope for their input,” she said. The strategy now is to change children’s diet through a school nutrition plan. Sales of sugary drinks this term are banned in the privately run secondary school canteens, and the government has produced lists of acceptable snacks, while the state-supplied lunches in primary schools are being overhauled. Yams, cassava, breadfruit and sweet potatoes are being brought back into meals. “Have children develop a palate for it? A lot of the parents are young and have been brought up on not too healthy foods, so that is what they know,” said Browne. At Queen’s College, a secondary school in Saint James, Joyann Clarke and Akilah Martin, who have the canteen concession, mix pureed pumpkin and carrots into the cheese sauce of their mac pie. Barbadians don’t much care for vegetables. When carrots were visible, the children would either avoid the meal or pick them out to throw away. “The kids love lamb stew, macaroni pie and chicken,” says Clarke, but all must now contain a vegetable. Until last term, 85% of their students ate fries every day – often with mac pie as well – and the drinks contained 15 to 20g of sugar. Now they sell grilled potatoes and salads dressed with garlic and olive oil, in smaller containers. Burgers are still on offer, but with lettuce, cucumber and tomatoes. Flavoured waters are on sale, but no sugary drinks. Hiding veg in the cheese sauce … Joyann Clarke. Photograph: Sarah Boseley/The Guardian “Sales are down,” says Clarke. “There’s no doubt about that.” It’s also more work. “We used just to slap a burger between bread.” But, says Martin, “they are going to have to get used to it.” Some schools are struggling. Martin and Clarke have formed an association to bring the canteen concession holders together and support each other. It’s important, they say. “These are our children who 20 years from now are going to be diabetic,” said Martin. The ministerial meeting beginning on 14 June will be focused on what to do about NCDs, including those involving mental health. In 2019, the WHO began to look at the commercial determinants of health, which Monika Kosinska, who leads on the issue for the organisation, describes as “how commercially driven processes impact broadly across public health”. It’s about food, but includes alcohol, tobacco, pharma and the extractive industries: how the interaction of commercial interests with economies, governance, trade and other areas contributes to health inequities. The WHO hopes to produce a global report next year. Kosinska says concerns, particularly about food, have come out “extremely strongly” from the small islands since a January meeting in preparation for the June summit, “highlighting the imbalance of power between the large commercial actors and small islands”. Nobody expects any miraculous solutions to the huge and intractable problems affecting small islands that have too little money and a history of being exploited. But the food industry must now be on notice that the fightback has begun.","Id":"global-development/2023/jun/08/barbados-fights-big-sugar-for-survival-of-its-people-diabetes","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webTitle":"Barbados fights Big Sugar for the survival of its people","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jun/08/barbados-fights-big-sugar-for-survival-of-its-people-diabetes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2023/jun/08/barbados-fights-big-sugar-for-survival-of-its-people-diabetes","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":2382,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T11:00:04Z","id":"global-development/2023/jun/08/barbados-fights-big-sugar-for-survival-of-its-people-diabetes","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Arsenal confident of landing Declan Rice and aim to pay West Ham £90m","body":"Arsenal are confident of sealing a deal to sign Declan Rice after the midfielder captained West Ham to a dramatic victory over Fiorentina in the Europa Conference League final on Wednesday. Rice is Arsenal’s top target and they intend to move quickly to try to fend off interest from Bayern Munich, Manchester United and Newcastle. Mikel Arteta’s side are leading the race for the 24-year-old and talks with West Ham are expected to accelerate soon. Related: Declan Rice delivers pulsating final act to push West Ham over the line | Ed Aarons West Ham hope to receive at least £100m for Rice, who wants to leave, and it would strengthen their position if an auction developed. Arsenal want to pay about £90m. The expectation is that Rice will make the switch to the Emirates Stadium. There is mutual respect between Arteta and the England midfielder. Rice, who is keen not to leave London, admires Arteta’s football and it is understood he wants to move to Arsenal. West Ham’s chairman, David Sullivan, confirmed on Thursday that Rice would be allowed to leave. “We promised him he could go,” he told TalkSport. “He set his heart on going and in due course he has to get on and we have to get a replacement. It is not something we wanted to happen. “We offered him £200,000 a week 18 months ago and he turned it down. You can’t keep a player who doesn’t want to be there. “I think the offers will start to come today. Three or four clubs have shown interest but, out of respect to West Ham, while we’re still playing, you don’t make offers for players.” Sullivan also said West Ham have no plans to sack David Moyes. They will hold talks with the manager to see whether he wants to stay. Rice, who joined West Ham’s academy after leaving Chelsea at the age of 14, has not let speculation over his future affect his football and he will depart as a club legend after the Conference League triumph. It was the perfect way for Rice to say farewell to West Ham, who had not won a trophy for 43 years. He walked back on to the pitch almost two hours after the final whistle, taking photos with the trophy and celebrating with club staff. Rice’s deal expires next June, with the club option of an additional year, and he wants to play in the Champions League. Thomas Tuchel, Bayern’s manager, has spoken to him but it is unlikely that Rice, who became a father last year, will want to go to Germany. Arsenal could be made to sweat if there is a late move from United, who are looking to strengthen their midfield. United’s interest in Rice is solid. However, their priorities are to sign the Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount and buy a striker. United are desperate to sign Tottenham’s Harry Kane, who is also wanted by Real Madrid, and they would need to sell players to free up funds for Rice. That leaves Arsenal in the driving seat. Arteta wants more power in midfield after missing out on the title to Manchester City and is expected to make space for Rice by selling Granit Xhaka to Bayer Leverkusen. Rice would become the most expensive player in their history. Nicolas Pépé, who joined from Lille for £72m in 2019, is their record signing.","Id":"football/2023/jun/08/arsenal-confident-declan-rice-west-ham-90m-david-sullivan","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webTitle":"Arsenal confident of landing Declan Rice and aim to pay West Ham £90m","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/08/arsenal-confident-declan-rice-west-ham-90m-david-sullivan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/jun/08/arsenal-confident-declan-rice-west-ham-90m-david-sullivan","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport","wordcount":549,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T10:42:54Z","id":"football/2023/jun/08/arsenal-confident-declan-rice-west-ham-90m-david-sullivan","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Tell us: are you spending significant parts of your income on your looks?","body":"We’re interested to hear from people who are spending a significant part of their earnings on improving their looks.

The £10,000 prize, which is named after groundbreaking film-maker Derek Jarman and recognises British artists who work with moving images, has a reputation for rewarding burgeoning talent within the UK art scene. Now in its 16th year, previous names on the shortlist have included Heather Phillipson, Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Monster Chetwynd, Oreet Ashery, Project Art Works and Charlotte Prodger. Oceanic … a still from On Freedom of Movement (wi de muv) (2022) by Julianknxx. Photograph: Studioknxx 2 This year’s finalists include 29-year-old writer and director Ayo Akingbade, whose 2022 film The Fist chimes with the clinking bottle lines of the Guinness brewery outside Lagos – the first to be built beyond Ireland and the UK – and uses the setting to examine globalisation, industrialisation and the politics of the workplace. West Africa is also the setting for another nominee, Sierra Leonean poet and artist Julianknxx, whose work combines the written word with footage of the Atlantic Ocean to tell stories of migration, colonialism and the Black experience. Closer to the UK yet no less political is nominee Andrew Black’s 2023 piece On Clogger Lane, a sometimes ghostly tour through Yorkshire’s Washburn valley and time itself. Alighting at Menwith Hill – the RAF base known as “the largest electronic monitoring system in the world” – it questions how the ancient British landscape can be utilised for the enforcement of American capitalism. Still from Eternity Knocker (2019) by Andrew Black Photograph: PR Elsewhere, Israeli-born Karen Russo creates a claustrophobic experience combining architectural footage with ominous soundtracks, while Yorkshire’s Rehana Zaman puts conversation and community at the forefront of her practice. Animator Sophie Koko Gate completes the list. Her DayGlo 2021 film Hotel Kalura – “made during lockdown in a wardrobe” – exudes surreal eroticism and features an extraterrestrial cocktail bar. No less strange, perhaps, than her previous work, 2018’s Slug Life, which told the story of a woman who develops a penchant for the slimy creatures. Speaking on behalf of this year’s jury, curator Matthew Barrington said: “This shortlist continues to reflect the fluid, boundary-pushing work being made within the ever-growing field of artists working with moving images in the UK. The poetic, socially conscious, and singular nature of much of the work connects both to the legacies of previous awardees as well as that of Derek Jarman, and his large body of politically engaged work.” The winner of the award will be announced on 20 November 2023 during a ceremony at the Barbican Centre in London. The work of the shortlisted artists will be going on a nationwide tour in the run-up to the ceremony, including dates at Nottingham Contemporary, Bristol’s Spike Island, Cardiff’s g39, Glasgow’s LUX Scotland and Eastbourne’s Towner Art Gallery.","Id":"artanddesign/2023/jun/08/film-london-jarman-award-nominees-announced","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webTitle":"Out of this world – 2023 Film London Jarman award nominees announced ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/08/film-london-jarman-award-nominees-announced","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/08/film-london-jarman-award-nominees-announced","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts","wordcount":467,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T10:19:37Z","id":"artanddesign/2023/jun/08/film-london-jarman-award-nominees-announced","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"West Lothian mosque calls for compassion after schoolboy’s death","body":"A mosque attended by the family of the 14-year-old boy who died at a school in Blackburn, West Lothian, has called for an end to “assumptions and speculations” as police continue their investigation.

Tens of millions of people in the US were under air quality alerts on Wednesday as smoke from Canadian wildfires drifted south, turning the sky in some of the country’s biggest cities a murky brown and saturating the air with harmful pollution. States across the east, including New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut, issued air quality alerts, with officials recommending that people limit outdoor activity. In New York City, where conditions were expected to deteriorate further through the day, residents were urged to limit their time outdoors, as public schools canceled outdoor activities. Smoke from wildfires in Canada has been moving south into the US since May. Hundreds of fires are burning in Canada, from the western provinces to Nova Scotia and Quebec in the east, where there are more than 150 active fires in a particularly fierce start to the summer season. How are New Yorkers coping? The whole city is immersed in a dystopian-looking smog: urban streets in sepia, emptier than usual, bathed in an eerie quiet. More were seen wearing face masks than usual these days, reminiscent of earlier days of the Covid-19 pandemic – and the feeling of potential doom the virus had induced. What should we do to protect ourselves? Exposure to smoke can trigger an array of health problems, experts say, but there are ways residents can keep themselves safe. Staying inside and especially refraining from strenuous outdoor activity is an important way to limit exposure. Keeping indoor air clean by closing windows and doors is also helpful, as is turning on air purification devices where available. Are the fires still burning in Canada? Yes. Hundreds of wildfires burning across Canada, many of them out of control, have blanketed cities in a thick haze of smoke, amid warnings from experts the situation will continue to worsen. What else is happening? Greenhouse gas emissions have reached an all-time high, threatening to push the world into “unprecedented” levels of global heating, scientists have warned. ‘No regrets,’ says Edward Snowden, after 10 years in exile Snowden has been in exile in Russia since 2013 after fleeing Hong Kong, where he handed over tens of thousands of top-secret documents to journalists. Photograph: Baikal/Alamy Edward Snowden has warned that surveillance technology is so much more advanced and intrusive today, it makes that used by US and British intelligence agencies he revealed in 2013 look like “child’s play”. In an interview on the 10th anniversary of his revelations about the scale of surveillance – some of it illegal – by the US National Security Agency and its British counterpart, GCHQ, he said he had no regrets about what he had done and cited positive changes. But he is depressed about inroads into privacy both in the physical and digital world. “Technology has grown to be enormously influential,” Snowden said. “If we think about what we saw in 2013 and the capabilities of governments today, 2013 seems like child’s play.” He expressed concern not only about dangers posed by governments and big tech but commercially available video surveillance cameras, facial recognition, artificial intelligence and intrusive spyware such as Pegasus used against dissidents and journalists. What did he say? Looking back to 2013, he said: “We trusted the government not to screw us. But they did. We trusted the tech companies not to take advantage of us. But they did. That is going to happen again, because that is the nature of power.” Republican hardliners’ revolt against Kevin McCarthy shuts down US House of Representatives McCarthy and Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic minority leader, at the Capitol on Wednesday. Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA The US House of Representatives has been forced to postpone all votes until next week, paralyzed by a revolt against its Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy, by ultra-conservative members of his own party. The standoff between McCarthy and a hardline faction of his own Republican majority has forced the chamber into a holding pattern that looks likely to persist until at least Monday. Members of the House Freedom Caucus have been upset over the bipartisan debt ceiling bill that McCarthy recently brokered with the Democratic president, Joe Biden, as well as claims that some hardliners had been threatened over their opposition to the deal. “You’ve got a small group of people who are pissed off that are keeping the House of Representatives from functioning,” said Republican representative Steve Womack. “This is insane. This is not the way a governing majority is expected to behave, and frankly, I think there will be a political cost to it.” What are the group angry about? The hardliners were among the 71 Republicans who opposed debt ceiling legislation that passed the House last week. They say McCarthy did not cut spending deeply enough and retaliated against at least one of their members. McCarthy and other House Republican leaders dismissed the retaliation claims. What has McCarthy said? He brushed off the disruption as healthy political debate, part of his “risk taker” way of being a leader – not too different, he said, from the 15-vote spectacle it took in January for him to finally convince his colleagues to elect him as speaker. With a paper-thin GOP majority, any few Republicans have outsized sway. In other news … Donald Trump speaks at his Mar-a-Lago estate in April.

But Pence faces unique challenges that could complicate his already difficult task of attempting to topple Trump, who continues to lead in polls of Republican primary voters. Although Pence’s actions on January 6 have been lauded by Republicans and Democrats in Congress, they have not made him as popular with the primary voters whose support he will need to win the nomination.

Climate check: Canada’s wildfires are part of our new climate reality, experts and officials say Canada is on track to experience its most severe wildfire season on record, and it’s part of a trend experts say will intensify. Photograph: Reuters Canada’s ongoing wildfire season is a harbinger of our climate future, experts and officials say. The fires are a “really clear sign of climate change”, said Mohammadreza Alizadeh, a researcher at McGill University in Montreal. Research shows that climate change has already exacerbated wildfires dramatically. A 2021 study supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association found that climate change has been the main driver of the increase in hot, dry fire weather in the western US. By 2090, global wildfires are expected to increase in intensity by up to 57% thanks to climate change, a United Nations report warned last year. Canada is on track to experience its most severe wildfire season on record, national officials said this week. It’s part of a trend experts say will intensify as the climate crisis makes hotter, drier weather and longer fire seasons more common.

Crest Nicholson, which last year built and sold more than 2,500 homes, said the government should step in to support the housing market as it was “undoubtedly experiencing softer demand than the previous year”, in a statement to the stock market on Thursday. On Wednesday, Halifax revealed the first fall in annual house prices in a decade. The housing industry is bracing for a slowdown after 12 consecutive interest rate increases by the Bank of England. The Bank is expected to raise rates further from 4.5% in the coming months as it tries to tame stubbornly high UK inflation. Peter Truscott, the chief executive of Crest Nicholson, said higher mortgage rates coupled with the end of the government’s help-to-buy scheme in England was limiting the ability of potential first-time buyers to get on to the housing ladder. He added: “If interest rates continue to rise, and remain elevated for a sustained period of time, this will undoubtedly exacerbate this issue even further and start to impact demand and confidence again. We continue to call on government to recognise this challenge and provide further support to these potential homeowners.” Data from Halifax, one of the UK’s biggest lenders, showed the first annual fall in average house prices since December 2012. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors on Thursday said “storm clouds” were gathering over the property market, despite a modest recovery in the sales activity during May. On Thursday, Crest Nicholson reported a drop in sales for the six months to the end of April and a fall in revenue to £283m, down from £364m the year before. The builder completed 894 homes in the half-year, down from 1,096 the year before, and half-year profits dropped 59% to £22.1m. Its shares fell 7% on Thursday morning. The company blamed the drop in sales squarely on the “economic uncertainty and lower confidence in the housing market” caused by the government’s disastrous “mini-budget” under the former prime minister Liz Truss and ex-chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng. The mini-budget prompted banks to raise their mortgage rates abruptly and a freeze in transactions. The turmoil eventually calmed, but further interest rate increases are expected by economists. The government under Rishi Sunak is reportedly considering restarting help to buy in an effort to appeal to younger voters, despite the view of many property experts and economists that the scheme mainly served to inflate prices and support builders’ profits. Crest Nicholson said it remained hopeful that “political solutions” could be deployed to improve the slow planning system and help affordability for first-time buyers, citing talks with the government.","Id":"business/2023/jun/08/more-uk-interest-hikes-will-weaken-housing-market-crest-nicholson-housebuilder-sales-drop","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webTitle":"More interest hikes will further weaken housing market, says FTSE 250 builder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/08/more-uk-interest-hikes-will-weaken-housing-market-crest-nicholson-housebuilder-sales-drop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jun/08/more-uk-interest-hikes-will-weaken-housing-market-crest-nicholson-housebuilder-sales-drop","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":457,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T10:05:23Z","id":"business/2023/jun/08/more-uk-interest-hikes-will-weaken-housing-market-crest-nicholson-housebuilder-sales-drop","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"‘Dream come true’: Alexis Mac Allister completes £35m Liverpool move","body":"Liverpool have completed the first part of their summer midfield rebuild by signing Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton for an eye-catching £35m. The Argentina World Cup winner has signed a five-year contract having spent two days undergoing a medical. He is the first arrival in a likely hectic transfer window at Anfield, having been identified as a key target before flourishing in Qatar. Related: Arsenal confident of landing Declan Rice and aim to pay West Ham £90m Liverpool have not disclosed the fee but it is understood to be £35m. The price represents a coup but meets the release clause in the contract Mac Allister signed with Brighton before the World Cup. That extension avoided him becoming a free agent at the end of this month. At 24 and with 160 first-team appearances, Mac Allister fits Liverpool’s criteria for the ideal target. Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Diogo Jota were similar in age and experience when moving to Merseyside. Mac Allister’s fight to establish himself as an elite player for club and country, along with his ability to play in various midfield roles and his game intelligence, were also part of the appeal. “It’s a dream come true, it’s amazing to be here and I can’t wait to get started,” said Mac Allister, who will get the No 10 shirt. “Since I won the World Cup I said that I want to win more trophies and I think that this club will help me to do that.” Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.

Liverpool moved swiftly to secure Mac Allister after he attracted widespread interest after the World Cup, where he gradually established himself as a key component in the world champions’ team. The groundwork and execution of the deal was led by Liverpool’s former sporting director Julian Ward, who has since been replaced by Jörg Schmadtke. The club’s longstanding relationship with Mac Allister’s agent, Juan Gemelli, who was involved in bringing Philippe Coutinho to Liverpool from Internazionale in 2013, also helped the transfer proceed smoothly and quickly. Mac Allister, who made clear he wanted to work with Klopp, will not be the last Liverpool midfield recruit. Manu Koné, the 22-year-old Borussia Mönchengladbach midfielder, and Khéphren Thuram, who is also 22 and plays for Nice, are of interest. Liverpool are not expected to follow up initial interest in Chelsea’s Mason Mount having got Mac Allister over the line. Klopp described Mac Allister as “very talented, very smart, very technically skilled” and said: “I have watched him grow from a young boy coming into the Premier League to a man who helped his country win the World Cup. That is quite a journey.”","Id":"football/2023/jun/08/liverpool-confirm-alexis-mac-allister-signing-brighton-35m","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webTitle":"‘Dream come true’: Alexis Mac Allister completes £35m Liverpool move","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/08/liverpool-confirm-alexis-mac-allister-signing-brighton-35m","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/jun/08/liverpool-confirm-alexis-mac-allister-signing-brighton-35m","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport","wordcount":423,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T10:00:17Z","id":"football/2023/jun/08/liverpool-confirm-alexis-mac-allister-signing-brighton-35m","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Everything’s Fine by Cecilia Rabess review – assured mixed-race, mixed-politics romance","body":"Love your enemies, exhorts the Bible; those who preach the doctrine, Nietzsche said, are “sweating while they do it”. The San Francisco-based data scientist turned novelist Cecilia Rabess somewhat agrees. Everything’s Fine, her much-hyped debut, is a blistering study of what it means to date your political opposite. The novel opens on Jess’s first day of work at Goldman Sachs in New York City. There she meets Josh, an analyst who is a previous classmate. Jess is Black and liberal; Josh is white and conservative. At the Ivy League college they went to, they had clashed on everything from affirmative action to Obama (they were in their freshman year when Obama was first elected president). Now, a year after their graduation, Josh is Jess’s mentor and a “rising star” while Jess is struggling to learn the ropes and is despised by their managing director. As the only woman on the trading floor, Jess is patronised by the men around her, including Josh, who fails to see how race and gender put her at a disadvantage. “But we’re in the same exact place, Jess,” he tells her. “We had the same education. We have the same exact job. What else do you want?” They bicker; they get in each other’s hair. Eventually, they become friends. There’s definite romantic chemistry (lust-filled eye contact, coquettish banter, alcohol-fuelled parties where bodies touch) but Rabess does not force the pair together. When they hook up, it’s a surprise to both, although Josh will later admit to Jess that he had been smitten “maybe since the first time I saw you, in a way”. Still, love does not broker lasting peace between them. Rabess’s deeper interest, it seems, lies in interrogating whether two people who are fundamentally different can be together at all. Rabess stages heated wars of ideas between the pair to press home their discordant standpoints on a number of hot topics: institutional racism, crony capitalism, wealth inequality, wokeism, diversity, Black Lives Matter, Donald Trump. She is more on Jess’s side than Josh’s, to be sure, but sometimes her flippancy ends up trivialising Jess’s situation. “To make up for so many centuries of oppression, Josh buys Jess lunch,” she writes at one point. Rabess is at her best when shining a light on the subtle mores that exclude Black women from conventions of desirability Josh is both a bully and someone with abundant good will. From covering Jess’s shift so she can go to a Rihanna concert to inviting her to join his trading desk when he takes up a new job, Josh goes all out to help Jess – and yet he can never quite bring himself to see the world from her perspective. He gaslights her, hectors her and shuts his eyes to how deeply his politics affects her. One regular topic of contention as the 2016 presidential election draws near is Josh’s wilful blindness to Trump’s “racism and xenophobia and misogyny”. Rabess captures the brokenness of their relationship in one powerful scene. Jess discovers a Maga hat in the kitchen of their home. She loses her cool, confronts Josh (“It’s just a hat,” he tells her) and then picks the hat from the floor where she dropped it and flings it at him. Jess observes how he catches the hat, “takes it by the brim and smacks it twice against his thigh, shaking away dust. Such a casual gesture.” Rabess is at her best when she is shining a light on the subtle mores that exclude Black women from conventions of desirability. “Blondes, brunettes, then redheads. Then everyone else,” a nagging “old voice” in Jess’s head tells her. When she meets Tenley, Josh’s blond ex-girlfriend, her insecurity translates to self-loathing. This is “the kind of girl who will make her feel sweaty and unkempt”. Some of the novel’s most penetrating insights pertain to the nuances of flirtatious language. “Pretty” can carry injurious racial import if you have previously been called “the prettiest Black girl we’ve ever seen”, Rabess tells us. So can the phrase “girls like you” that Josh casually throws at Jess early in their courtship “as a compliment probably, but it wasn’t”. As Jess puts it: “It only meant that … there were two kinds of girls: girls and girls like her.” Rabess does not always achieve the incisiveness of these moments. Everything’s Fine remains, however, an assured debut that provides an honest look into the fraught terrain of a mixed-race, mixed-politics romance. • Everything’s Fine by Cecilia Rabess is published by Picador (£16.99).

Before the illness, she ran a tech consulting business and had a busy life. “The virus left me unable to breathe and I was hospitalised in March,” she says. After Covid in 2020, her relationship broke down. In an effort to regain her health, Adelina started walking and getting fitter near where she lived in Cambridge. She joined a dating app in November, writing on her profile that she liked nature and had “just about died from Covid” a few months before. Alan, who lived in Milton Keynes, responded. “I said it was a bit of an abrupt change in tone from talking about nature walks and asked how she was doing now,” he says. Liking that he had read her profile, rather than sending a generic hello, Adelina started chatting to him. A few weeks later they agreed to meet for a walk. “When I first saw him, I thought: oh my God, this guy looks a bit feral with his long beard,” she says, laughing. But they clicked straight away. “She was bright and bubbly, and very cheery,” says Alan. “I’m an analyst for a car company, so I’d been working at home for months. It felt like a nice change.” Over the weeks they enjoyed more walks together and bubbled through the autumn lockdown. “It’s hard to explain but Alan just felt like home,” she says. “He’s a very empathetic person and made me feel really safe.” At Christmas, Alan intended to see his family in Scotland but the last-minute lockdown made it impossible. They spent the festive period watching films instead at Adelina’s. “We got on so well and had so much fun.” After Christmas, Alan returned home and Adelina began to feel unwell. She was suffering from breathlessness and exhaustion – the same symptoms as months earlier. Over the next few weeks, she became progressively worse and was in and out of hospital. “At first, nobody knew what was wrong, but by February I could barely walk and my doctor told me it was long Covid.” Although they had only known each other for a month, Alan continued to visit regularly. “He essentially moved in to care for me, which is not something I ever expected. I assumed he would leave. He even washed me and fed me with a spoon,” she recalls. Adelina and Alan a month after they first met, and the day she started to feel ill. Photograph: Supplied Yet Alan says he loved their time together, especially on Adelina’s good days. “She made me laugh and, if she could manage it, we would go out and have an ice-cream in the park or get a takeaway,” he says. They became an official couple in March 2021. “She wrote me a little letter asking me to be her partner and offering me a house key,” he remembers. Adelina says she was really nervous about asking. “I didn’t want to trap him with an ill person. My friends pointed out that he kept coming back and doing all these amazing things for me.” As Adelina’s health continued to deteriorate, she started to research treatments online. She discovered that she had a vitamin B12 deficiency and low potassium levels; factors likely to be hampering her recovery. After a series of B12 injections and iron infusions, Adelina slowly began to feel better. By summer 2022, she could return to most of her usual activities. “I can’t believe I’m still alive,” she says. “Alan took a huge gamble coming to see me when I was ill, but hopefully the risk paid off. He made me want to fight. Having someone in your corner really means a lot.” She recently proposed to Alan on a beach in France and the couple plan to move in together soon. “Adelina is so smart, capable and interesting,” says Alan. “She is very much her own person, but we enhance each other when we are together. She challenges me to be more adventurous and I think I calm her down at the right times.” Callout","Id":"lifeandstyle/2023/jun/08/how-we-met-he-moved-in-after-a-month-together-to-care-for-me-then-he-kept-being-amazing","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webTitle":"How we met: ‘He moved in after a month together to care for me – then he kept being amazing’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/08/how-we-met-he-moved-in-after-a-month-together-to-care-for-me-then-he-kept-being-amazing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/08/how-we-met-he-moved-in-after-a-month-together-to-care-for-me-then-he-kept-being-amazing","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":675,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T10:00:04Z","id":"lifeandstyle/2023/jun/08/how-we-met-he-moved-in-after-a-month-together-to-care-for-me-then-he-kept-being-amazing","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"There are no winners in the Women’s World Cup broadcast fiasco, only losers","body":"If a tree falls in the woods, does it make a sound? If a World Cup kicks off on the other side of the world but no one can watch it, does it really happen? We are 43 days out from the Women’s World Cup starting in Australia and New Zealand but, with Fifa threatening a blackout because of low offers for the broadcast rights from the biggest European footballing countries, you wouldn’t know it. There are no adverts, no references to coverage and there is no buildup. Instead, prospective viewers and existing fans in those countries have been left in limbo. Related: Players at 2023 Women’s World Cup to be paid fees directly by Fifa for first time How on earth did we get here? The Fifa-backed official Women’s World Cup began in 1991 after decades of unofficial events and demands for the world governing body to get behind the women’s game. Even that tournament, while it was run by Fifa for the first time, was held at arm’s length and called the “1st Fifa World Championship for Women’s Football for the M&M’s Cup”, to avoid any risk of it tarnishing the World Cup branding. Since then, commercial and broadcast rights for the showpiece tournament, which failed to embarrass and thus was bestowed with the more traditional branding to become the “Women’s World Cup” for the 1995 edition, have been bundled and sold as part of the deals for the rights of the men’s World Cups. Except it has not been equal billing as value has not been attributed to the women’s edition. Instead, it has been an add-on, a freebie thrown in to make the huge sums thrown at the men’s edition more palatable. It feels like a lot of money to be spending? Well, broadcasters, you’re getting the women’s too! What a bargain. There has been little effort to gauge the value of the tournament in its own right, which has held back women’s football. From the big – undervalued rights – to the small – not enough official merchandise and low kit availability – for almost 32 years the Women’s World Cup has been been pretty much deemed worthless and unprofitable by Fifa. It has been charity. It is loss-making and Fifa will take the hit because the optics of not supporting a Women’s World Cup in an increasingly progressively minded society is not acceptable. Returning to the present day the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, was outraged by the low offers from broadcasters for the rights to show the Women’s World Cup, which kicks off on 20 July, describing it as a “slap in the face of all the great Fifa Women’s World Cup players and indeed of all women worldwide”. Fair enough, some might say. The bids are low. Staggeringly low in some cases. The opening offer in Italy was believed to have been €300,000 (£283,000), compared with the €160m that was paid for the rights to the men’s competition in Qatar. In England, the figure for the joint offer from the BBC and ITV is believed to be around €9m, about 8% of what was paid for the men’s edition. The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, has demanded broadcasters increase their bids for the tournament, but his request has not yet had the desired effect. Photograph: Alan Lee/EPA The problem is that the demand for a huge increase in funds allocated from broadcasters for the Women’s World Cup is being demanded by an organisation that has historically been responsible for the undervaluing of the tournament. When the global governing body places little value on a tournament, why should federations, broadcasters, sponsors or anyone else act differently? In addition, Fifa is not arguing for a reallocation of broadcasters’ budgets for major football tournaments, but a massive increase in them. There is an assumption that the rights for the men’s World Cups will remain as high as they are and that broadcasters should be finding money to bring the value of the rights for the women’s tournament closer in line with that, with the ambition of it eventually being level. That is what Fifa is doing with prize money, after all, raising the Women’s World Cup prize pot to $110m (£88.4m) for this year’s tournament and committed to matching the men’s prize pot by the 2027 edition. However, while the status of football as the world’s No 1 sport keeps the governing body’s coffers full, broadcast journalism is not a growing industry at the moment, it is a shrinking one. In England, the BBC has made huge cuts to local TV and radio services, while Sky Sports has axed Soccer AM and asked football presenters to reapply for their jobs as part of a restructure. The BBC and ITV have reportedly told football pundits they will not receive any pay increases next season. So while Fifa is right to suggest (less of the demanding please) more should be spent on the rights, it is also important to consider where that money can come from. How about accepting that broadcasters will need to offer less for the men’s rights in order to start closing the gap? One thing is for sure: playing hardball is not the right tactic. In this scenario, where essentially a media blackout in Europe’s biggest footballing countries is threatened, no one wins. Fifa does not get more money and broadcasters do not get the viewing figures. And, crucially, the biggest loser is the historically underfunded and undervalued women’s game, which is reliant on major tournaments to boost interest and investment in it. What can Fifa do instead? How about using less aggression and more discussion? Bring broadcasters to the table to have a fair and holistic discussion about the broadcast rights of the men’s and women’s tournaments and how you sustainably grow audiences, tournaments and revenue all round. And do it now.","Id":"football/blog/2023/jun/08/womens-world-cup-broadcast-rights-fifa-bbc-sky-itv","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webTitle":"There are no winners in the Women’s World Cup broadcast fiasco, only losers | Suzanne Wrack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jun/08/womens-world-cup-broadcast-rights-fifa-bbc-sky-itv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2023/jun/08/womens-world-cup-broadcast-rights-fifa-bbc-sky-itv","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport","wordcount":930,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T10:00:04Z","id":"football/blog/2023/jun/08/womens-world-cup-broadcast-rights-fifa-bbc-sky-itv","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"‘We knew a bad man had taken her’: the murder of Collette Gallacher – and her sisters’ fight for justice","body":"Lauren Holmes was 11 when she discovered how her sister, Collette, had died. There were woods near the family home in Corby in Northamptonshire, and Lauren had ignored her mother’s warning that they were unsafe. “We knew we weren’t allowed to go there,” Lauren remembers, “but we did, and we got chased by a local lad. Two of my friends ended up in hospital getting thorns removed because they’d tried to escape through the brambles. That evening, everyone’s parents gave us a real rollicking, but my mum was just silent. I couldn’t understand why she wasn’t shouting. I was sent to my room and she came in and threw a load of newspapers on my bed, and she said: ‘This is why you’re not allowed to go into the woods!’ I felt shocked and guilty. It was a hard way to find out.” The newspapers explained that a local man named Adam Stein had abducted six-year-old Collette Gallacher in February 1986 as she waited for a bus to take her to school, the same school where her mother worked as a playground assistant and dinner lady. Corby in the 1980s was a much smaller place than it is today. Struggling with the fallout of the closure of the British Steel plant, which had been Europe’s largest steelworks, there was high unemployment – but there was also a sense of community in the streets around the Gallachers’ home. “Everyone knew each other,” Lauren says. It was not unusual for a six-year-old to be sent off to school alone. On the day of the abduction, “someone asked my mum where Collette was, and that’s when they realised something wasn’t right,” Lauren says. The search for Collette lasted five days, and Stein was one of the many locals who volunteered to look for her, before her body was found in the attic of the house that he shared with his wife and young son. Stein admitted rape as well as murder, but the sexual assault charge lay on file – a decision sometimes taken if a defendant has also pleaded guilty to more serious charges. Lauren and her younger half-sister Claire believe this was in order to spare the family from sitting through details of the attack in court. Stein was jailed for life and told he would serve a minimum of 20 years. Thirty-seven years later, Collette’s sisters are still fighting to make sure he does not escape justice. Claire Holmes was not yet born and Lauren was only 15 months old when Collette was killed, but her murder still dominates their lives. Their mother, Karen, did her best to shield them from what had happened but when Claire, now 32, was nine or 10, she stumbled across a box of newspaper cuttings. “I was in my mum’s room having a nosy around, as I shouldn’t have done. We always knew we had a big sister, that a bad man had taken her, but it was a taboo subject. My mum still struggles to say Collette’s name. My grandad had to explain it all.” From the kitchen table of the house she shares with her partner and (at times) their eight children, Lauren, 38, has been working with Claire to put pressure on the government to prevent sex offenders from changing their names after release. They have also had to fight to have their sister’s murderer placed on the sex offender register. In April, they travelled to London to meet Damian Hinds, minister for prisons, parole and probation, to explain their concerns that weaknesses in the law make women and children more vulnerable when sex offenders are released from prison. ‘This isn’t a witch-hunt’ … Claire and Lauren. Photograph: John Robertson/The Guardian Lauren, who works as a carer at a home for adults with a rare genetic condition, feels she has become a part-time detective, working with the local Corby journalist Kate Cronin to investigate why her sister’s murderer was sent back to prison after his release in 2016. It appears this was connected to driving offences, and she discovered he had changed his name and begun a relationship with a vulnerable teenager during the short period he was free. Claire has begun a degree in criminology, spurred on by her concerns about flaws in the justice system. The sisters want to make it clear that their activism does not stem from vindictiveness. “This is not a witch-hunt. We hoped he would be rehabilitated in prison, but everything we now know suggests that hasn’t happened,” Claire says. “The latest parole statement that we have says that he is still having bad thoughts about children, and not understanding the consequences of his actions. From all the information we have, he does not seem to be a man who has changed.” They are cautiously optimistic that their campaign may be getting somewhere. In March, the Labour MP for Rotherham, Sarah Champion, organised a debate on sex offenders’ name changes, while Bolsover’s Conservative MP, Mark Fletcher, had a 10-minute-rule bill on the same subject; both argue that it is too easy for sex offenders to conceal their identities. “A sex offender can change their name and with little difficulty receive a passport or a driving licence with their new name,” Fletcher told MPs. “At no point are you asked if you have a criminal background. In some cases this can lead to a DBS check under their new identity.” A DBS, or Disclosure and Barring Service, check is required for some jobs or voluntary roles, particularly in healthcare or in positions that involve working with children. Collette’s sisters did not intend to devote so much of their lives to campaigning, but the target of their concern has evolved over the years. Stein was refused parole several times before being released in 2016 and returned to prison in 2017. He was released again in 2021 and sent back in July 2022. After his first release, they were dismayed to discover that he had not been placed automatically on the sex offender register. Their campaigning resulted in his name being added, but they are still uncertain about whether the initial failure was because he did not have a conviction for rape or because the offence predated the launch of the register. It doesn’t take a genius to realise that sex offenders are not the most trustworthy group A newspaper article by Cronin prompted a woman to get in touch to say that while he had been out of prison in 2016, Stein, then 58, had changed his name and struck up a relationship with her, when she was 18. He admitted that he had been in prison after killing a child, but told her it had been an accident. The sisters were concerned that Stein’s ability to change his name made it easier to conceal his past. “You shouldn’t be able to hide when you’ve committed crimes of this nature. That should be something that you carry for the rest of your life,” Claire says. The Safeguarding Alliance warns that the child sexual offenders’ disclosure scheme (also known as Sarah’s law, named after eight-year-old Sarah Payne, who was murdered by a paedophile in 2000), which allows parents to check if a person has a record for child sexual offences, becomes useless if the offender has changed their name. Asked why this weakness has not already been fixed, Fletcher said this was “a bit of a head-scratcher”. There is the possibility that post-prison rehabilitation would be undermined for those who have reformed and want a new start, but the government is not making this case, just arguing that sex offenders are already required to notify the authorities if they change their names and face an extra five years’ imprisonment if they fail to do this within three days of the change. Campaigners point out that many fail to do so. Freedom of information requests from the Safeguarding Alliance show that about 900 sex offenders went missing between 2017 and 2020, while 16,000 had in some way breached their notification requirements in the past five years. As Fletcher told MPs: “It doesn’t take a genius to realise that sex offenders are not the most trustworthy group.” Champion, meanwhile, has pointed out that some perpetrators change their name before being formally charged with an offence, “meaning their birth name remains unmaligned”. Collette’s sisters are hopeful that reform may be included in the victims and prisoners bill currently going through parliament. In the meantime, they have been working with Cronin to try to get more information about whether Stein still poses a threat to the public ahead of his next possible release in 2024. Cronin’s attempts to obtain more information about him have been complicated by the name changes. “It’s not about pitchforks. It’s about keeping women and girls safe,” she says. The family are dismayed that they are still fighting to ensure Stein is properly monitored after his release. “His name is constantly in our mouths,” says Claire. “It would have been lovely to know that he had been released and quietly got on with his life. It does happen. People do change their lives – but that’s not been the case. We feel like we can never have peace.” Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Cubbyhole, a lively corner spot in New York’s West Village, is beloved for its kitschy decor, booming jukebox, and $2 margaritas. But she went for a different reason. She wanted to find her people. Bennett was in college just outside of New York, and it took about an hour on the Metro North train to reach “Cubby”. She’d go into the city alone, find a seat at the bar, and sit there for hours, flipping through a magazine or writing in her notebook. Even though she made the trip solo, she would always meet someone at Cubby. It was a room full of people she knew would accept her, no questions asked. Cubby, she says, was the “place I discovered the beauty of my queerness”. Bennett moved to New York after graduation, and took her first role in journalism, launching the queer vertical at Seventeen. She became even more of a regular at Cubby. There is no place like it, she says, and for a sad reason: too many lesbian bars have closed. When Cubby opened in 1987, it was one of 207 lesbian bars in New York. By the time she was going there in the 2010s, there were barely two dozen of those spaces left. Customers pose outside Cubbyhole. Photograph: Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images Like Bennett, Krista Burton grew into herself at lesbian bars. After she came out in her early 20s and left the Mormon faith, Burton found her chosen family there. She spent her 20s making friends at lesbian bars, gossiping about hookups and dancing to Britney Spears songs. But by 2017, Burton, a queer writer and creator of the popular blog Effing Dykes, noticed that lesbian bars were vanishing in front of her eyes. She wrote about the phenomenon for the New York Times in 2017. Things only got worse when the pandemic forced more spaces to close. A 2021 documentary, The Lesbian Bar Project, chronicled the decline of a once thriving subculture. Moby Dyke: An Obsessive Quest to Track Down the Last Remaining Lesbian Bars in America, Burton’s first book, is a love letter to lesbian bars, and a travelogue of the 19 spots still open in the US when she wrote it. The Guardian brought Bennett and Burton together to discuss what’s lost when these spots close. Related: Parades but no public posts: which brands are supporting Pride in the wake of backlash? Bennett: Why did you decide to write about lesbian bars? Burton: I wrote a piece for the New York Times in 2017 called “I want my lesbian bars back”. I just really, really missed those spaces. My agent and I talked over an idea for a book about road-tripping to each one, but we decided not to do it. Then during the pandemic, there was more media attention on it. Erica Rose and Elina Street created The Lesbian Bar project, which became a documentary produced by Lea DeLaria, and I was kicking myself. I wished I’d written the book. But then an editor at Simon & Schuster contacted my agent saying we should do it, finally. I jumped at the chance. Patrons dance on the shared dance floor of the bars A League of Her Own and Pitchers in Washington DC. Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images Whenever I travel, I try to find a lesbian bar to visit. But unless you’re in a big city, it’s pretty difficult to do that – and even the cities have few options. There are only four lesbian-specific bars in New York City, for instance. Why have so many lesbian bars closed? There is gentrification. There is the fact that lesbians make way less money than cis men, so they don’t have as much money to go out. There are dating apps now, so you don’t need to go out to meet people. Sometimes bars are owned by a couple and the couple breaks up, and they don’t know what to do with the bar, so it just shuts down. There are succession issues; someone dies and now we don’t know who owns the bar. But I would say the main issue is gentrification. If you don’t own the building your bar is in, the landlord can say: “You know what would look cute here? Condos.” Do you remember the first lesbian bar you went to? The Lexington Club in San Francisco, which was an iconic bar that’s closed now. I was obsessed with it. I went to college at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, so I’d been to gay bars before, but never lesbian bars. I was 21 or 22, and my jaw was on the floor. I couldn’t believe that every person in that room also liked girls. Outside the Lexington Club in San Francisco, 2014. Photograph: San Francisco Chronicle/Hearst Newspapers/Getty Images I went with my girlfriend at the time, and every weekend night it would be mobbed with queers. Even before I went inside, I knew it was different and special: the line into the Lexington Club was a social space in itself, where queers would be smoking, or making out, or fighting with their girlfriends. I never lived in San Francisco, but I’d visit for work a lot, and I would be so jealous of the gays who got to go there whenever they wanted. After you started going to lesbian bars, what did you look for in one? I love bars that are very small, have tchotchkes everywhere, and look really lived in – like Cubbyhole, in New York City. But I also love the clubs. I went to Sue Ellen’s in Dallas, which was like a lesbian Studio 54. I’d never seen a lesbian nightclub before; this place had two stories and multiple bars. It was packed both nights that I went there. When you walk in to Sue Ellen’s, you are greeted by four massive TV screens above the bar, each one playing a different Guy Fieri show. I never found out why, because I was too distracted by the dance floor: people of all ages really getting down, from young kids to old couples. Generally, the bars I visited were so much busier than I expected them to be. You hear about the death of lesbian bars, and you might think the places would be totally empty. But it’s the complete opposite: in so many of the bars, you just could not move because there were so many people. Cubby is such an important place for me. So that might be my favorite bar in your book. What was your favorite? I had a couple. One of them closed in the last few weeks, and I’m crushed about it – Herz, in Mobile, Alabama. When I walked into Herz for the first time, literally every single patron – and I’m not exaggerating – every single person, including the bartender, turned around on their stools and said hello. And none of them knew me; I was a complete stranger walking into their space. I felt incredibly welcomed, and I talked to everyone that night. Herz was owned by the only two Black lesbians who ran an inclusive bar in the country. They’re in their 60s, and they wanted everyone to feel at home at Herz, so the bar had two rules: no talking politics or religion. Customers gather at the Back Door in Bloomington, Indiana. Photograph: Jeremy Hogan/Alamy ‘Everyone there seemed to be having the greatest night of their lives.’ Photograph: Jeremy Hogan/Alamy I also have to say the Back Door in Bloomington, Indiana. I’d get in a car and drive there right now. I’ve been out and gay for 20 years, and I’ve seen a lot of drag. I thought I’d seen it all. But I saw one of the best drag shows of my life there – all the queens were working so hard. I’ve never seen a crowd tip more. There was an actual line at the ATM during the performance, because everyone wanted to get bills for tipping the queens. The drag queens were humping the floor, doing splits, grinding on people’s faces as they threw cash at them – who knew that’s what went on in Indiana? Everyone who was there seemed to be having the greatest night of their lives, and no one stole my purse when I left it on a table for 20 minutes, filled with cash. I especially appreciated that. Oh, and there’s one fact I love about Wild Side West, a San Francisco lesbian bar I visited. Janis Joplin was allegedly a regular, and she would play shows there. You mention feeling welcomed at these spaces, and I’m wondering if you think that lesbian bars are inclusive of all queer people? In my experience, even if bars just identify as a straight-up lesbian bar, they have gone out of their way to make it known that everyone is welcome. It’s both a good sentiment and good business, because then more people can spend money inside the bar. Sometimes people I met on on the trip would tell me that the bar didn’t use to be so welcoming to people who didn’t identify as a lesbian. But that has vanished. And how do you know how someone identifies when they walk in, anyway? You can’t know just by looking at them. That’s definitely true. On the other hand, my whole career as a fashion editor has been based off of clothes being a reflection of who a person is. How did you dress at these bars, and what did you want that to communicate to other patrons? I did half the book dressing how I would normally go out: a tight dress, large earrings, boots with heels, lipstick, makeup, the whole thing. Very femme. Sometimes, I really stuck out looking like that. Midway through the trip, I decided to start dressing in what I called “queer cosplay”, which was very stereotypical: a ripped sweatshirt dress, no makeup, black leggings, and Blundstones. In that outfit, I was invisible, and I moved through the crowds a bit more undetected. When I came up to interview people for the book, they knew that I spoke their language, and that I was there for the same reason they were. The Duchess bar in the West Village, during the Pride parade in New York, 1982. Photograph: Barbara Alper/Getty Images What did you learn from the lesbian bars you went to in smaller cities and towns? If you turn a space into a lesbian bar, it becomes a destination. People will travel to go to these spaces. When I was at Alibi’s in Oklahoma City, I sat next to someone who drove 100 miles just to hang out that night. I was startled by that, but the bartender said they get that all the time. I love that, because your book is not just about these spaces, but also the people who occupy these bars. Who were some of the characters you met during the trip? The owner of the Back Door, Smoove. They tell the dirtiest jokes I’ve ever heard in my life, and they are phenomenal. They’re so dedicated to keeping the bar open and holding events for everyone. And they have a scale for how dirty their jokes get: dad jokes are on the tamer end, “step-dad” jokes are a bit spicier, and then the dirtiest are called “the guy your mom brought home from Taco Tuesday” jokes. Then there was Jill, the security guard at My Sister’s Room in Atlanta. She had so many lesbian-adjacent jobs. Along with doing security at the bar, she was a gym teacher, and then she played in four separate semi-pro softball leagues. She’s incredible. It’s Pride month, and that means some young queer people are going to lesbian bars for the first time. What advice would you give them? Number one, no one is thinking about you as hard as you are thinking about you. You might be feeling incredibly self-conscious, which is totally fine. But whatever’s in your mind as the worst case scenario is not going to happen. Also, if you want to make friends, it’s incredibly effective to just go up and say hi to someone. Don’t be afraid to be the person who approaches. A couple at Cubbyhole when it reopened in June 2021. Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The Guardian Totally, and queer spaces are a safe place to do that. There’s this new lesbian bar that just opened up in Brooklyn called the Bush. It opened after you finished your book, as have a few new spots in Portland, Chicago, and Los Angeles. How does that make you feel? I had this joke that I’d leave town, and a lesbian bar would open up right away. I missed so many. But that gives me hope for young queers now. I was actually at the opening for the Bush. It was packed – I waited at least an hour to get in. I’ve never seen a line for a bar like that; it went down multiple city blocks. The line itself was really fun. I kept checking out people’s fashions and making new friends while we all waited. There’s another bar next door, a bar for gamers, and the owner kept coming out and taking drink orders for us to sip while we waited. There were so many queer people out and ready to party. I think that speaks to how these spaces are still so, so needed. There’s just this feeling that you get when you’re surrounded by an entire room full of people who are not only OK with who you are, but they fling the doors wide open for you. It’s a place where I feel celebrated, and instantly comfortable. Willa Bennett is editor-in-chief of Highsnobiety.

Seema Malhotra said the proposal was an important part of the transition to net zero, by phasing out new fields from which to extract fossil fuels and boosting Britain’s “sovereign capability” for clean and green energy. “It is important now you don’t have a policy that rides a coach and horses through any of your climate pledges,” she told Sky News on Thursday. “And if other countries did the same [with policies that broke climate pledges] – if that happened around the world – we would actually see global warming increase by 3%. So you have to make some of those choices now.” Unions, including Unite and GMB, have said the plan would cause large job losses, but Malhotra stressed that Labour wanted jobs to be transferred to green energy industries, not lost. Related: Does the UK really need to drill for more North Sea oil and gas? A rift has been growing within Labour since news of the pledge to end new oil and gas extraction emerged. Gary Smith, the general secretary of GMB, said on Sunday that Labour had “got it wrong” and risked creating “a cliff-edge with oil and gas extraction from the North Sea”. Sharon Graham, the leader of Unite, said last week that Keir Starmer’s announcement had “left out everything that was important – the detail”, and that he should have been clear workers would not be hammered by the transition. The number of workers directly employed on oil and gas fields in the North Sea are estimated at 20,000, with a further 200,000 jobs onshore. Labour has said it expects its plan to shift the focus to renewables to create up to half a million jobs in the industry, including at least 50,000 in Scotland. It has been criticised by the Conservatives, but welcomed by the UK’s most senior climate adviser, John Gummer, who was also a Conservative environment secretary in the 1990s. Malhotra said the move was necessary because “a just transition means having a plan now for how you’re going to see some of those jobs and those skills transfer to where the future is”. Starmer, the Labour leader, was to visit British Steel on Thursday to outline plans for investing in it as a “foundation industry”, she added. “We’re not going to be able to build those new turbines, wind turbines or solar energy or look at hydrogen as a future, or look at carbon capture and storage without having some of that sovereign capability here. “And other countries, frankly, are ahead of us in this race. We’ve got to look now and make decisions for how we have a global competitiveness in our green industry, and make sure that we see jobs transition over a period of time in a planned way, working with unions, so that everyone who has got those skills now in other energy sectors will be able to transition to be part of that future.”","Id":"politics/2023/jun/08/labour-mp-defends-north-sea-drilling-plans-against-union-criticism","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Labour MP defends plans to block North Sea drilling against union criticism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/08/labour-mp-defends-north-sea-drilling-plans-against-union-criticism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/jun/08/labour-mp-defends-north-sea-drilling-plans-against-union-criticism","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":504,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T09:59:15Z","id":"politics/2023/jun/08/labour-mp-defends-north-sea-drilling-plans-against-union-criticism","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Nearly a third of baby foods sold in UK are ultra-processed, research finds","body":"Nearly a third of baby and toddler foods sold in the UK are ultra-processed, risking children’s long-term health and development, according to research. The report for First Steps Nutrition Trust found that ultra-processed products dominate the diets of British babies and preschool children. Analysing previously unpublished UK data from a 2021 pan-European study of levels of processing in infant and toddler food, the report found that while overall 29% of food in the baby aisles of supermarkets is ultra-processed, the proportion rises to half for baby snacks and cereals and to three-quarters for baby biscuits and rusks. These ultra-processed products are often marketed as healthy or natural options, despite having higher levels of salt, sugar, fat and additives that are associated with obesity, cancer, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the report found. By age two to five, UPFs account for nearly two thirds (61%) of calories consumed by UK children – a higher proportion than their peers in the US and Australia. Dr Chris van Tulleken, the author of Ultra-Processed People, said: “We are in the middle of a child health emergency, with UK children heavier on average than in almost any other country. Ultra-processed foods are strongly associated with weight gain. They also change children’s long-term food preferences and have a huge range of harmful effects on their bodies, including malnutrition and stunting: many children in the UK aren’t just heavy for their age, they are also short.” The report calls on the government to regulate the composition, labelling and marketing of commercial baby and toddler foods and drinks, as well as to ensure public health recommendations explicitly address food processing, in line with international best practice. National dietary guidance in a number of other countries including Brazil, Israel and France has specific recommendations to reduce UPF consumption among young children. Some of the foods included in the report were HiPP Organic baby food jar veg and mozzarella potato bake; mPiccolo Organic apple, banana and strawberry yoghurt Melts; Little Dish cottage pie; Ella’s Kitchen organic peach and banana melty sticks; and Heinz Splash apple and blackcurrant juice.

But companies are misleadingly marketing inappropriate and unnecessary products as ‘natural’ or with ‘no added ingredients’ when actually they are ultra-processed, risking damage to children’s long-term health and development. “The government promised to tackle this misleading labelling and marketing of baby food more than two years ago. If not now, when?” Dr Eszter Vamos, from Imperial College London’s school of public health, said: “This report highlights just how much ultra-processed foods our children are eating from a young age, and it calls for important and urgent actions on ultra-processed foods. “While we need more research to understand the mechanisms linking UPFs to poor health, the available evidence on the harmful effects of high UPF intakes in children is too strong to ignore. “Our food systems are currently failing to provide families with healthy diets because they are oriented towards generating profit from selling UPFs, and children are main consumers. We need policies that transform our failing food systems and make healthy foods available, accessible and affordable, and address the aggressive and misleading marketing of UPFs.” The Department of Health and Social Care said: “We have legislation in place which regulates the nutritional, compositional and labelling standards for baby food and this includes ensuring labelling is not misleading for consumers.” It said information for families was available on its weaning hub, and that its restrictions on the location of unhealthy foods in supermarkets reduced the “pester power” of children. The British Specialist Nutrition Association, which represents the manufacturers of many of the products, said: “BSNA members are committed to making nutritious products and marketing them in a responsible way, recognising that they are a valued option for parents and carers of young children. “Foods and drinks specifically created for infants and young children are highly regulated and are required to adhere to strict safety and nutritional standards. These processing techniques are essential in ensuring products are safe and nutritionally appropriate for the specific needs of infants and young children.” What is ultra-processed food? Ultra-processed food involves extremely high levels of manufacturing to produce. It includes all formula milk, many commercially produced baby and toddler foods, fizzy drinks and sweets, fast food, snacks, biscuits and cakes, as well as mass-produced bread and breakfast cereals, ready meals and desserts. What do these foods contain? Ultra-processed ingredients include fruit juice concentrates, maltodextrin, dextrose, golden syrup, hydrogenated oils, soya protein isolate, gluten, “mechanically separated meat”, organic dried egg whites, as well as rice and potato starch and corn fibre. Additives such as monosodium glutamate, colourings, thickeners and glazing agents are also ultra-processed. Why does it matter? Ultra-processed food contains higher levels of salt, sugar, fat and additives that are associated with obesity, cancer, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. They also tend to have lower levels of protein, zinc, magnesium, vitamins A, C, D, E, B12 and niacin necessary for a child’s optimal growth and development. It is also thought that other mechanisms are at play in UPFs being associated with worse health outcomes, including negative effects on the development of gut microbiota. • This article was amended on 8 June 2023 to correct the spelling of Chris van Tulleken’s surname.","Id":"society/2023/jun/08/ultra-processed-food-baby-toddler-health-risks-report","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Nearly a third of baby foods sold in UK are ultra-processed, research finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/08/ultra-processed-food-baby-toddler-health-risks-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/jun/08/ultra-processed-food-baby-toddler-health-risks-report","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":909,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T09:52:37Z","id":"society/2023/jun/08/ultra-processed-food-baby-toddler-health-risks-report","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"The joy of the slow burn record: ‘Not only did I warm to his drawls, I became obsessed’","body":"The Clash – Sandinista! (1980) When I first heard Sandinista! as a schoolboy, I was baffled by the way this supposed “punk band” careered between genres or combined them, several at a time. Today, now that revolutions such as the iPod and streaming have changed the way we listen to music, the 36-track triple album sounds like the ultimate mixtape. It’s a two-hour long hurtle through rock, pop, funk, soul, Motown, dub, jazz, calypso, R&B and swing. The Magnificent Seven – which I always loved, along with the anti-military The Call Up – is even thought to be the first UK rap track. Careering between genres … The Clash. Photograph: Michael Putland/Getty Images Rediscovering it as an adult on a remastered CD version that came out in 2013, the sprawling opus certainly has flaws but I can’t quite comprehend how my teenage ears didn’t recognise the greatness of the likes of Police on My Back, Somebody Got Murdered or Charlie Don’t Surf. Maybe Sandinista! was so far ahead the world needed to catch up. Dave Simpson Charli XCX – Vroom Vroom (2016) New appeal … Charli XCX. Photograph: Lorne Thomson/Redferns One handy/mortifying thing about criticism is having your initial reactions preserved in print forever: it can help you plot your changing taste; it can also give that artist’s fans a stick to beat you with for life. When I had Twitter, I never got as much blowback for anything as my Pitchfork review of Charli XCX’s Vroom Vroom EP, which I slated on release in February 2016. Related: Charli XCX: ‘People who take it too far are better than people who don’t’ Charli’s first full-length collaboration with PC Music’s Sophie was a tweaky, blown-out romp through acid bass lines, panel-beater thwacks and demented baby voices. At the time, I dismissed it as “pointedly uncommercial and abrasive” and “ferociously trite”. It took until seeing her live in 2019 to appreciate those qualities: you’d call it a slow burn if the EP’s car-obsessed lyrics weren’t so speed-addled. Where I once thought those asinine themes reduced her to a “vapid cypher”, now their commanding hauteur connected directly to Charli’s vulcanised stage presence. And by 2019, the general collapse of society brought a new appeal to a record that sounds like a pep rally on the edge of a black hole. I was relieved to boot some of my old self-seriousness into that void. And as ever, Charli was ahead of her time, leaving me gratefully eating her dust. Beep beep! Laura Snapes Bob Dylan – Murder Most Foul (2020) It’s not just that I wasn’t into Bob Dylan, it’s that I didn’t want to be into him. As far as I could tell, his best song was bettered by Hendrix and his blues and folk forebears seemed much more deserving of this frankly obscene surplus of renown. Still, my contrarian self couldn’t resist giving Murder Most Foul a listen; arriving at the advent of Covid with its amateur artwork and 17-minute runtime, the meditation on JFK’s assassination appeared curiously, hilariously out of touch with the present to the point of becoming a meme. I listened with intent to poke fun but soon found Dylan repeating himself – first as farce, then as tragedy. Not only did I warm to his lackadaisical drawls and those woozy wanderings of piano and violin, I became obsessed. Maybe it’s the slapstick brutality of the lyrics that run the JFK tape back and forth like a sports action replay, or the way the he embarks on an entire litany of Americana unprompted, winking as he places his ramblings on top like some cherry. Regardless, I’ve found an unlikely refuge in his mythological account of the day the US was born and the day it died. Tayyab Amin 50 Cent – Get Rich or Die Tryin’ (2003) Like many who were born in the late 90s, 50 Cent’s In Da Club featured heavily in my childhood. The track stayed in the UK charts for 32 weeks but it lingered for much longer, its quickly renowned refrain about partying like it’s your birthday reverberating from music channels and school playgrounds. As co-producer Sha Money XL once noted, In Da Club became “the birthday record”: “You play Stevie Wonder and then you play In Da Club.” It did indeed become ubiquitous at parties, but the novelty value quickly wore off and I began to find it intensely annoying. After subconsciously writing 50 Cent off based on that track alone, hearing Get Rich or Die Tryin’ played in full almost two decades later surprised me. This time, I heard his forays into new styles and moods that had been overshadowed by the hits, and the unfamiliar interludes that tied the songs together. I soon grew to love the record’s steely keys and skulking percussion, the blockbuster bad-boy persona and the softer moments scattered throughout, like the surprisingly melodic account of his shooting in Many Men (Wish Death), or the pleas for commitment from a lover in 21 Questions, propped up by an achingly good Barry White riff. “Could you love me on a bus?” remains one of my all-time favourite corny lyrics. Twenty years later, I’ve still not exactly 180’d on In Da Club, but as for the rest of it, consider me a convert. Safi Bugel Lana Del Rey – Norman Fucking Rockwell! (2019) As someone occasionally drawn to melancholy and tragedy, friends thought I would love Lana Del Rey. People whose taste gelled with mine were obsessed but while Video Games stirred something in me back in 2012, I found tracks such as Summertime Sadness grating. Through some combination of silly contrarianism, a discomfort about her public persona as a frequently thin-skinned, disengaged white woman, and perhaps an unease with sitting in my feelings beyond my established sad time records, I shrugged off one of the biggest singer-songwriters of the past decade as simply not for me. Last year, shortly after turning 30, after taking stock of the way I was treating myself and letting others treat me, I finally put on Norman Fucking Rockwell! on a whim – and God, why had no one told me how funny Lana Del Rey is? Lines like “Why wait for the best when I could have you?” eviscerated me. Now, I’m mesmerised by her silver-screen vocals delivering dark humour over dreamlike production . When I’m feeling fraught, her music is like being with friends, making fun of ourselves and misguided past romances, relinquishing ourselves to the ephemeral beauty of feeling it all. Tara Joshi Miles Davis – Birth of the Cool (1957) Beautiful, rich, transporting music … Miles Davis. Photograph: Album/Alamy I bought Miles Davis’ Birth of the Cool about 20 years ago, because it was an album you’re supposed to own: legendary, pivotal, turns up on the critics’ best lists. I played it a couple of times without it making much impression, then filed it away. I came back to it during lockdown: by then I knew more about jazz, but I’m not sure a knowledge of the genre’s history or an understanding of the album’s context really figured in my appreciation. My main reaction was a horrified shock: how had music as glaringly, self-evidently beautiful as Moon Dreams or Venus De Milo gone in one ear and out the other? How did I not notice the richness of Israel and Jeru? Perhaps it was a matter of time and place: beautiful, rich, transporting music was what I needed to hear during lockdown. Or perhaps you just can’t predict when music is going to beckon you in, which makes the moment it does all the more delicious. Alexis Petridis Deee-Lite – Dewdrops in the Garden (1994) Deliciously uncategorisable … Deee-Lite. Photograph: Tim Roney/Getty Images Until a few years ago, I, like most people, only knew one Deee-Lite song: their 90s smash-hit Groove Is in the Heart. Though a technically excellent piece of music, it was repeated at one-too-many a cheesy club night for my liking, regrettably leading me to assume that the rest of their catalogue was also Austin Powers cosplay. One day I was listening to an Apple Music radio show when the excellent Call Me, from the band’s last album, Dewdrops in the Garden, rang out. It struck me as what might be the cheekiest ode to pining for a phone call ever made; a marvellously bubbly and eccentric track full of telephone noises over a thumping house beat. It led me to check out the album, which turned out to be deliciously uncategorisable: a hedonistic mix of classic house, bratty eurotrance, brash pop and more. Vocalist Lady Miss Kier is a woman whose voice comes straight from her diaphragm; Bittersweet Loving lays her impeccably soulful belt over Paradise Garage-era synths, while River of Freedom and Music Selector Is the Soul Reflector are part rave, part video game drones that increase the heart rate along with the BPM. It taught me to always listen beyond the hit – or potentially risk missing out on extreme delight. Christine Ochefu Lady Gaga – Chromatica (2020) I was 10 when Lady Gaga’s debut single, Just Dance, came out and I found the hype confusing. At that age, I found her arch, somewhat intense, and a bit tuneless – an orgy of unmoored vowel sounds and over-the-top aesthetics that made me squirm. As the years passed, I found intermittent moments of enjoyment in her output: I liked the undeniable Paparazzi, the twisted Abba vibes of Alejandro, the Kevin Parker drums on Perfect Illusion. But, for the most part, I was a staunch hater who found her unapologetic too-much-ness too much. Then A Star Is Born was released. At first I was underwhelmed by what I felt was a hokey and rockist longueur. A few weeks later, though, I heard I’ll Never Love Again, the film’s closing ballad, in a friend’s car and inexplicably began to weep. I saw the film again during a moment of personal tragedy and found it impossibly moving. I started to warm to Gaga the person, although I still couldn’t stomach her music. During the pandemic, her 2020 album Chromatica became an unexpected salve for me and my housemates. Every Friday night, we sat in our living room and quietly drank whatever liquor we had, enjoying the perverse feeling of listening to euphoric music while not having much fun at all. When lockdown lifted, we all still loved Chromatica, and delved deeper into her catalogue, finding wry humour, intense hooks, bizarre classic rock tributes (such as the Queen homage Yoü and I and the brilliant, Paul McCartney-like Just Another Day) and, suddenly, I was an absolute Gaga-head, rattling off trivia at bars and vying desperately to get tickets to the Chromatica tour. Now I look back and find it unconscionable that I ever saw anything in Gaga other than a generous entertainer, brilliant songwriter and enduring icon.

My father died many years ago in my childhood home and my mother still lives there. I was a teenager at the time but had some first aid training, so I attempted to save his life while we waited for the ambulance crew to arrive. Ultimately, we were unsuccessful. Only recently was it suggested that I have PTSD and I am now seeing a trauma therapist. Since that night, I have always dreaded returning to the house and though I now live more than 100 miles away, I still get the same feeling every time I visit. Sometimes the feeling is stronger than others; it can vary from a vague discomfort to all-out dread. If I confide in my mother, she will feel compelled to sell up and move; I know she does not want to do this. And even if she does, I worry I will still dread the idea of seeing her (and my siblings) because they remind me of what happened that night. My mother was there when it happened so it must have been traumatic for her, too. We love each other, and talk occasionally, but are not particularly close. I am so sorry that this happened to you. Losing a parent at such a tender age is devastating enough without the added dimension of trauma. Seeking treatment for PTSD is a positive step, no matter how much time has elapsed since the event. “After treatment, usually Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR), a person will hopefully be less traumatised by the memories,” says clinical psychologist Linda Blair. “But you still have to go through a desensitisation process if you want to be near the site of the event. It also sounds like the problem has been generalised to include the other people who were there, so a multi-step process is required.” On the positive side, Blair says that there is a very good chance of recovery. I was curious about why you want to address the issue of visiting the house now, and it’s something Blair also wondered. “Think about what has changed that you feel the need to have this conversation now. If you can’t think of anything, why don’t you keep things as they are and wait until after your therapy is completed?” The psychotherapist Matt Wotton agrees. “As human beings we love clarity and certainty, we crave it. It drives us to rush at things rather than taking a step back and deploying ‘watchful waiting’, seeing how things go. The latter can feel unsatisfactory but the truth is you don’t need to make a hasty decision about having an impossible conversation.” He suspects that you are locked into a pattern of thinking, likely driven by feelings of guilt. “You imply you can’t see your family because they remind you of your dad, which is a really sad, tough position to be in. Might it be nice to remember your dad as he was: the fun one, the silly one, or however he was?” Wotton also suggests you reframe the movie you’re replaying in your mind. “You tried to save your father. It didn’t work, but if this was a film, that could be a moving, compassionate scene. Without minimising what happened, try to find something poignant and beautiful in that moment, rather than focusing on a sense of failure.” If you can’t delay speaking to your mother, Blair suggests writing a letter. “You have been thinking about this for years but it could be shocking, brutal even, for her to hear it out of the blue. It’s fair enough that you want her to be aware of your distress but do it gently. Something like: ‘Mum, I wish my feelings had gone away about what happened with Dad but they just haven’t. I’m working on that but in the meantime I’m always reminded of it starkly when we’re at home. Could I stay in a B&B next time and we can still have happy times together? I wanted to write to you so you have time to think about this before we talk.” Then, when you do visit, I would introduce an enjoyable new ritual, for example taking her for afternoon tea or a pub lunch which would give you both something to look forward to, rather than dwelling only on the past. ● If you would like advice from Anita on how to navigate thorny issues between you and a friend, partner, or family member, submit a brief description of your concerns here.

Lucas told her constituents in Brighton Pavilion, a seat she has represented since 2010, that serving as an MP meant she had “struggled” to spend time fighting for the environment. Speaking to the BBC she said: “I’m definitely not going away. I am going to be looking at how I can still serve to make change happen but at different ways of doing that.” Her decision comes a month after the Green party lost control of Brighton and Hove council despite gaining more than 240 seats elsewhere in the English local elections. The party’s co-leaders praised the popular MP as a “force of nature”. In her letter to constituents, Lucas said: “I have always prided myself on being, first and foremost, a good constituency MP. I’ve done everything possible to help wherever I can and always worked to ensure that people feel heard, that their concerns matter, and that they are not alone. “But the intensity of these constituency commitments, together with the particular responsibilities of being my party’s sole MP, mean that, ironically, I’ve not been able to focus as much as I would like on the existential challenges that drive me – the nature and climate emergencies.” Explaining her decision to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Lucas said: “Because I have to be the frontbench spokesperson on everything for my party from benefits to Brexit, it just means that I can’t give the time that I personally want to those big issues around climate and nature.” Asked if she planned to take part in direct action protests, she said: “I certainly thing there is a role for peaceful direct action.” Questioned about recent action by Just Stop Oil protesters, she said: “Whether or not I agree with every single tactic, they have certainly accelerated the focus on this issue and mobilised huge numbers of people.” Lucas added: “Licensing more oil and gas, that is what is truly dangerous and radical, not people who are quite understandably driven to take action in the streets because they are seeing that we are careering towards a cliff edge.” In 2010 #Brighton Pavilion made history by electing me UK’s 1st Green MP & it’s been the honour of my life. My open letter to residents & friends explains why I’m not standing at next General Election. With love & gratitude, I hope I've done you proud \uD83D\uDC47https://t.co/H3QwRffE2x pic.twitter.com/GEavTgkgqJ — Caroline Lucas (@CarolineLucas) June 8, 2023 Lucas, 62, who served two spells as Green party leader, joins a list of more than 50 MPs who have announced they will not be contesting the next election. They include the former SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, the Conservative former deputy prime minister Dominic Raab and the former deputy Labour leader Margaret Beckett. In 2010 Lucas became the first and only Green party candidate elected to parliament. Her majority increased at the subsequent three elections, with voters returning her to parliament with a majority of almost 20,000 in 2019. In comments first reported by the Argus newspaper in Brighton, Lucas said it had been the “privilege of my life to serve this extraordinary constituency and community”. She added: “I have always been a different kind of politician – as those who witnessed my arrest, court case and acquittal over peaceful protest at the fracking site in Balcombe nearly 10 years ago will recall. “And the truth is, as these threats to our precious planet become ever more urgent, I have struggled to spend the time I want on these accelerating crises. I have therefore decided not to stand again as your MP at the next election.” Lucas was Green party leader between 2008 and 2012 before returning for a second stint, this time co-leading the party with Jonathan Bartley for two years from September 2016. A tweet from Lucas confirming her decision to stand down prompted hundreds of replies, most expressing both sadness and gratitude. MPs from across the Commons paid tribute to Lucas’s time in parliament, including Labour’s Chris Bryant, the SNP’s John Nicholson, Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville Roberts and the Liberal Democrat frontbencher Layla Moran. The Green party co-leader Carla Denyer said: “Caroline’s impact on politics in this country cannot be overstated: she truly is a force of nature and has been an extraordinary servant of the people of Brighton Pavilion as well as the Green party. We are so proud of her achievements.” The joint leader Adrian Ramsay said: “Very few politicians can claim to have changed the course of the national debate in the way Caroline has. She has brought so much to us as a party, shown real integrity in her work and added a crucial dimension to our democracy in this country. “Having MPs who are genuinely dedicated to standing up for the climate and nature could not be more important than it is right now and that’s why we are striving to get more Green MPs elected at the next general election so that we can build on Caroline’s achievements.”","Id":"politics/2023/jun/08/green-party-mp-caroline-lucas-to-stand-down-at-next-election--brighton-pavilion-","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Green party MP Caroline Lucas to stand down at next election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/08/green-party-mp-caroline-lucas-to-stand-down-at-next-election--brighton-pavilion-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/jun/08/green-party-mp-caroline-lucas-to-stand-down-at-next-election--brighton-pavilion-","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":805,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T09:12:38Z","id":"politics/2023/jun/08/green-party-mp-caroline-lucas-to-stand-down-at-next-election--brighton-pavilion-","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"A Streetcar Named Desire review – rage restrained, then turned up to 11","body":"It must be tempting for an actor playing Blanche DuBois to be unhinged from the start. Once they know the emotional battering the character is about to go through – the layers of regret and recrimination made volatile by drink – they would have cause to enter with an air of hysteria. But Kirsty Stuart is too subtle an actor for that. Nalini Chetty (Stella) and Matthew Trevannion (Stanley) in A Streetcar Named Desire at Pitlochry Festival theatre. Photograph: Fraser Band As the unsteady centre of Tennessee Williams’s 1947 play, directed here by Elizabeth Newman, she repeatedly reminds us of the respectable teacher she claims to be. She is not merely dissembling to cover up a dissolute lifestyle. This is a woman with the intelligence, charm and perhaps even empathy to be an admired member of the community. As she cracks, her declarations of superiority become ever more hollow, but she has enough poise and spark to make you believe her life is not entirely a sham. This makes her clashes with sister Stella and brother-in-law Stanley Kowalski all the more brittle. Nalini Chetty’s Stella is a fascinating contrast to her wayward big sister. On a rotating set by Emily James, its spiral staircase glinting under Jeanine Byrne’s lights that turn everything a brooding copper and green, she is at once plainer and more self-assured, having none of Blanche’s élan but so much more rootedness. She has the quiet charisma of a woman who has got exactly what she wants. And what she wants, riskily and lustily, is Matthew Trevannion’s Stanley. In a production unafraid to swim into the play’s undercurrent of domestic violence, he is both scarily assertive and troublingly magnetic. With shaven head and tattooed arms, he bellows for attention before spitting out his words. Accused of being an ape, he pounds his chest in defiance. He is every inch the “unrefined type”. Chetty’s Stella is his sexual equal, but Stuart’s Blanche is continually wrong-footed by him, flinching and retreating, even as her intellect tells her she should be his match. Their exchanges are intense, the volume ratcheted up to 11 in a pummelling production that comes most alive when any combination of these three actors is on stage. The languid rhythms of Pippa Murphy’s jazz score does nothing to quell their passions.

The source of the material remains unclear, but several people with knowledge of the case confirmed to the Guardian Australia that it was included in evidence provided to parties including lawyers for Lehrmann, the ACT office of the director of public prosecutions, and investigating officers as part of Lehrmann’s criminal case. Third parties external to the investigation and court case could also have had access to the material.

The ACT supreme court chief justice declined to comment on the ongoing leaks. The material was also not circulated as part of the ACT board of inquiry, which is set to hand down a final report by the end of July, Guardian Australia has confirmed. The audio recording was published by the Seven Network, which also declined to comment. It included Higgins, Sharaz, then-Project presenter Lisa Wilkinson and a producer, Angus Llewellyn, speaking in January 2021, before Higgins’ interview with Wilkinson was broadcast.

In the Project interview, broadcast several weeks later, Higgins detailed allegations of being raped in parliament house, but did not name Lehrmann. Lehrmann faced a criminal trial in the ACT supreme court last year over the rape allegation made by Higgins, a former colleague. The trial was discontinued because of juror misconduct, and a retrial ruled out because of the potential effect on the mental health of Higgins. Lehrmann has always maintained his innocence. A lawyer in Lehrmann’s defamation case, Paul Svilans, did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian, but told news.com.au that they did not have the material. “We have not had access to the phone and audiotape you refer to,’’ Svilans told news.com.au. “In fact, we are at present actually seeking access to the audiotape for the purpose of the defamation proceedings for the reason that we don’t have it.” The defamation case Lehrmann is pursuing against Network 10 and the ABC is set down for a case management hearing on Friday, and Guardian Australia believes concerns about the use of this material will be raised before Justice Michael Lee. The leak of the audio recording came after text messages reportedly taken from Higgins’ phone were reported for several weeks in the Australian and Daily Mail. Stories based on the text messages have focused, among other things, on conversations Higgins had to secure a book deal, Higgins and Sharaz’s plan to work with Labor politicians after the rape allegations were published, and comments Sharaz made about former prime minister Scott Morrison, who he called disparaging names. The Australian did not respond to a request for comment about the leaks. Daily Mail Australia editor Barclay Crawford said the publication “does not discuss – or reveal – its sources”. ACT policing declined to comment. Two inquiries, by the Australian federal police, and by the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, into whether officers improperly disclosed information relating to the case, remain ongoing. Barrister Steve Whybrow, who represented Lehrmann at the criminal trial, told news.com.au the material was kept secure at all times. Lawyers representing Higgins declined to comment. Media law barrister Matt Lewis, who was speaking generally rather than about the Higgins leaks, said that lawyers who obtained material produced under a compulsive process, such as a subpoena, during a court proceeding were precluded from providing it to others under what is known as the Harman principle. Related: ‘Simply didn’t happen’: Bruce Lehrmann insists he did not rape Brittany Higgins “If that document is then leaked, which sometimes happens, to members of the media, than ordinarily [the media’s] in-house legal counsel would have their antenna go off like a Christmas tree, because that would usually mean you were unable to publish that, unless it was really in the public interest to do so,” Lewis said. “You run the risk of a contempt of court, if you publish information which is otherwise confidential.” There is no suggestion any of the outlets who published the leaked material have committed contempt. Nor does Guardian Australia suggest any party leaked the material. Dr Denis Muller, a University of Melbourne media ethics expert, said the repeated reporting of leaked material despite the abandonment of the legal proceedings, because of concerns about Higgins’ mental health, was a “very dangerous development”. He said the ongoing reporting meant “what we now seem to be having is a genuine case of trial by media”. There appeared no public interest in the reporting of the material, he said, and there appeared several reasons why the reporting should cease, including that it was occurring outside the legal process, and the impact the reporting would have on Higgins. “The complainants are already in a position where giving over anything … is a matter that requires a great deal of trust on their part that the material will not be misused,” Muller said. “I think it’s absolutely the case that an already difficult climate for people claiming sexual assault is being made even more difficult.”","Id":"australia-news/2023/jun/08/leaked-brittany-higgins-material-to-be-raised-in-federal-court-hearing-of-bruce-lehrmann-defamation-case","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Leaked Brittany Higgins material to be raised in federal court hearing of Bruce Lehrmann defamation case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/08/leaked-brittany-higgins-material-to-be-raised-in-federal-court-hearing-of-bruce-lehrmann-defamation-case","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jun/08/leaked-brittany-higgins-material-to-be-raised-in-federal-court-hearing-of-bruce-lehrmann-defamation-case","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":940,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T09:02:26Z","id":"australia-news/2023/jun/08/leaked-brittany-higgins-material-to-be-raised-in-federal-court-hearing-of-bruce-lehrmann-defamation-case","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"House of Representatives to hold hearing on whistleblower’s UFO claims","body":"The House of Representatives plans to investigate claims that the US government is harboring UFOs after a whistleblower former intelligence official said the US has possession of “intact and partially intact” alien vehicles. James Comer, the Republican chair of the House oversight committee, said the committee would hold a hearing into claims by David Grusch, who led analysis of unexplained anomalous phenomena (UAP) within a US Department of Defense agency, that the government had been collecting non-human craft for “decades”. Related: US urged to reveal UFO evidence after claim that it has intact alien vehicles Grusch, who left the government in April after a 14-year career in US intelligence, told the Debrief that information on these vehicles was being illegally withheld from Congress. “There will be oversight of that,” Comer told NewsNation. “We plan on having a hearing.” Comer said he had heard about Grusch’s claims, but added: “I don’t know anything about it.” The timing of the hearing is not yet determined, but a source familiar with the matter said a date is expected to be announced in the next few weeks. Tim Burchett and Anna Paulina Luna, Republican members of Congress from Florida and Tennessee, respectively, will lead the oversight committee investigation. Burchett is working closely with House oversight committee leaders to prepare for a hearing, the congressman’s office said. The witness list for the hearing has not yet been set, so it is unclear whether Grusch will publicly testify before the oversight committee. “Congressman Burchett’s office is working through logistics, including a witness list of the most credible witnesses and sources who would be able to speak openly at an unclassified hearing,” a spokesperson said. Austin Hacker, a spokesman for the committee, told the Guardian in a statement: “In addition to recent claims by a whistleblower, reports continue to surface regarding unidentified aerial phenomena. The House oversight committee is following these UAP reports and is in the early stages of planning a hearing,” Hacker said in a statement. “The National Defense Authorization Act for 2022 created the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office which coordinates among the Department of Defense, the intelligence community, Nasa, and other federal agencies to study UAPs. “Americans, who continue to fund this federal government work, expect transparency and meaningful oversight from Congress.” Luna addressed her appointment in a tweet on Wednesday. “Thank you @RepJamesComer! Very happy to announce @RepTimBurchett and myself will be working with the @GOPoversight team to lead out the investigation into UAPs (UFOs),” Luna said. Grusch made his claims in an interview with the Debrief journalists Leslie Kean and Ralph Blumenthal, who previously exposed the existence of a secret Pentagon program that investigated UFOs. He said the US government and defense contractors had been recovering fragments of non-human craft, and in some cases entire craft, for decades. “We are not talking about prosaic origins or identities,” Grusch told the Debrief. “The material includes intact and partially intact vehicles.” Grusch said analysis determined that this material was “of exotic origin” – meaning “non-human intelligence, whether extraterrestrial or unknown origin”. According to the Debrief, Grusch’s knowledge of non-human materials and vehicles was based on “extensive interviews with high-level intelligence officials”. He said he had reported the existence of a UFO material “recovery program” to Congress. In the Debrief article, Grusch does not say he has personally seen alien vehicles, nor does he say where they may be being stored, but in a follow-up interview with NewsNation, he insisted his story was accurate. “We’re definitely not alone,” Grusch said. “The data points, quite empirically, that we’re not alone.” Jonathan Grey, a current US intelligence official at the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (Nasic), confirmed the existence of “exotic materials” to the Debrief. “The non-human intelligence phenomenon is real. We are not alone,” Grey said. “Retrievals of this kind are not limited to the United States. This is a global phenomenon, and yet a global solution continues to elude us.” Grusch told the Debrief that he had filed a complaint with the intelligence community inspector general. That complaint contained classified locations, program names and other data, the Debrief said. Nick Pope, who spent the early 1990s investigating UFOs for the British Ministry of Defence, said the existence of that complaint could hamper the oversight committee investigation. “As an active complaint it is very difficult to get into the substance of the testimony, because it constitutes interference with an ongoing investigation,” Pope said. Pope added: “So, for anyone who thinks great, the hearing will determine whether David Grusch’s allegations are correct or not, I think an awful lot of [what is said in the hearing] is going to be: ‘That’s the subject of an ongoing investigation and we can’t discuss it.’” Pope said to find out whether Grusch’s claims about alien craft are true, “we need a few key pieces of information”. “Number one is the project name or office name. Number two is who is the person in charge of that – the director, the commanding officer, whoever it is? Thirdly, what agency is it embedded in?” Grusch’s claims came after a series of credible sightings and reports over the past two years. In 2021, the Pentagon released a report on “unidentified anomalous phenomena” – the term is preferred to UFO by many extraterrestrial enthusiasts and investigators – which found more than 140 instances of UAP encounters that could not be explained. The report followed a leak of military footage that showed apparently inexplicable happenings in the sky, while navy pilots testified that they had frequently had encounters with strange craft off the US coast. Following renewed interest in UFOs the Pentagon established the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022, to investigate unexplained phenomena. In April this year Sean Kirkpatrick, the director of AARO, told the Senate armed forces committee that the office had “found no credible evidence thus far of extraterrestrial activity, off-world technology or objects that defy the known laws of physics”.","Id":"world/2023/jun/08/ufo-house-representatives-hearing-investigation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"House of Representatives to hold hearing on whistleblower’s UFO claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/ufo-house-representatives-hearing-investigation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/08/ufo-house-representatives-hearing-investigation","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":972,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T09:00:02Z","id":"world/2023/jun/08/ufo-house-representatives-hearing-investigation","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"England raw sewage taskforce has only met once in last year, FoI request reveals","body":"The storm overflows taskforce set up by the government to tackle raw sewage discharges by water companies in England has only met once in the last year, a freedom of information request has revealed. The group, which was promoted by ministers as evidence that they were taking the issue of raw sewage discharges by water companies seriously, is supposed to meet fortnightly, according to its mission statement. But in response to a freedom of information request by the Good Law Project, officials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the taskforce had only met once in the last year. The storm overflows taskforce was set up in August 2020 after the Guardian first uncovered the scale of raw sewage discharges into rivers by water companies. It is made up of representatives from government, regulators, the water industry and environmental NGOs. Its terms of reference state: “The taskforce will meet fortnightly, with exact frequency and timings of meetings at the discretion of the chairperson in consultation with the group members.” Its goals are “to develop: proposals to significantly reduce the frequency and impact of sewage discharges from storm overflows short-term actions to accelerate progress to reduce the harm caused by storm overflows”. Last August the group published its storm overflows reduction plan, which gives water companies a deadline of 2035 to reduce the amount of sewage flowing into bathing water and areas of ecological importance. Water companies were given a deadline of 2050 to stop dumping raw sewage elsewhere. The then environment secretary, George Eustice, said water companies would have to invest £56bn over 25 years to tackle storm sewage discharges by 2050. But the plan was heavily criticised as too weak and is to be challenged in court by the Good Law Project and the campaign group WildFish. Since that publication the taskforce has not met again, the freedom of information request shows. The Good Law Project sought all fortnightly meeting dates of the taskforce between 1 April 2022 to 25 April this year, but Defra revealed it had only met once in that time, on 30 August 2022. There have been no follow-up meetings to drive through the storm overflow reduction plan, or to check progress. Defra said as the taskforce had published its storm overflows reduction plan in August last year it had not met again. “These proposals were outlined in the storm overflow discharge reduction plan (the plan). The plan was published on 31 August 2022, and we have therefore not called a meeting of the taskforce following the publication of the plan.” Defra said in its response: “Since last summer officials have continued to take action on sewage discharges, including the development of the water restoration fund, launching the continuous water quality and event duration monitoring consultation and the variable monetary penalties consultation, as well as continuing to work with regulators to hold water companies to account. We have also recently announced a new statutory target for storm overflows and plans to consult on expanding the storm overflow discharge reduction plan.” England has about 14,500 storm overflows, which are supposed to be used in exceptionally heavy rain to stop the sewage system backing up into people’s homes. But water companies have been routinely dumping raw sewage into rivers and seas even in periods of dry weather. In 2021 the taskforce published a report that estimated the cost of cutting millions of hours of raw sewage discharges from storm overflows would be between £150bn and £660bn – figures that were challenged by some experts. Emma Dearnaley, the legal director at the Good Law Project, said: “We now know that the government’s storm overflows taskforce has met only once since April 2022 – and not at all since its plan was published. That is, unfortunately, typical of this government’s laid-back approach to the sewage crisis blighting our country. “We need the government to impose tougher measures to stop water companies from polluting our waters and bring this unacceptable situation to an end. That is why we are supporting a legal challenge to try to compel the government to put in place a much more robust and urgent plan.” Ashley Smith, of the Windrush Against Sewage Pollution group, said: “[The taskforce] produced precisely what it was designed to do – nothing. We need an independent inquiry now to make sure this disgraceful scam on the public and environment is ended and never repeated.”","Id":"environment/2023/jun/08/england-raw-sewage-taskforce-met-once-in-last-year-storm-overflows","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webTitle":"England raw sewage taskforce has only met once in last year, FoI request reveals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/england-raw-sewage-taskforce-met-once-in-last-year-storm-overflows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jun/08/england-raw-sewage-taskforce-met-once-in-last-year-storm-overflows","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":736,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T08:48:44Z","id":"environment/2023/jun/08/england-raw-sewage-taskforce-met-once-in-last-year-storm-overflows","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Best podcasts of the week: Where did Covid come from?

Alexi Duggins There’s a podcast for that Marvyn Harrison with his son Blake, 6, and daughter Ocean, 4. Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer With Father’s Day on the horizon, Charlie Lindlar chooses five of the best podcasts for fathers, from parenting advice from Made in Chelsea stars to a show with a focus on Black fatherhood Help! I’m a Parent Those first months with a newborn are usually the longest and hardest any parent will go through. This unfiltered podcast from Made in Chelsea alumni Ollie Proudlock and Emma Louise Connolly charts their journey into parenthood, and makes for a valuable companion. Caring for a new baby can be confusing and exhausting, and hearing both a mother’s and father’s perspective on the physical and emotional changes that a family experiences makes for varied listening for dads. The episode on Emma learning to love her C-section scar is particularly moving, as well as being an informative look at how body image can transform after childbirth. Dads Who Try Where many dad pods overcompensate, with hosts who boast about being “kickass” or “bossing” parenting, this show sets a more honest tone, starting with its name. To hosts Nate and Tommy, raising children is impossible to “win”, and in the end is all about trying your best. Though the duo bring on the occasional guest and veer off on charming tangents about sports and craft beer and the news, Dads Who Try is at its best when it is simply two fathers being open about the things they wish they were managing better, whether it’s feeling guilty for missing the gym, figuring out sex after childbirth, or working from home with kids. Dope Black Dads On Father’s Day in 2018, Marvyn Harrison (pictured above) texted his group of dad friends simply to say how much he appreciated them. The response he received moved him so much he began the Dope Black Dads community, from which this podcast was born. Primarily a space to talk about the intersection of fatherhood, race and culture, the Dope Black Dads podcast also touches on all the small things that change in your life when you become a dad too. There’s plenty for every dad to learn here, regardless of your ethnicity. Mom and Dad Are Fighting Slate’s parenting advice podcast featuring writers Jamilah Lemieux, Elizabeth Newcamp and Zak Rosen is much less combative than it sounds. There are no squabbles here, just mums and dads tackling tangible, knotty parenting problems, like what happens when your child starts to swear, how to introduce makeup and whether there is such a thing as too much Bluey, with grace and humour. The show runs the gamut from toddler tantrums to teenage angst, which makes this a perfect podcast to listen to in advance to prepare you for the years to come. Fathers and Sons For something completely different, try this six-part documentary series produced by podcast house Radio Wolfgang and clothing brand Mr Porter. Each 30-minute episode is an intimate study of a father and son’s relationship, with each telling us something meaningful about what it means to be a dad, a son and indeed a man. The two most touching episodes: The Date, which sees son Jack get his divorced dad James (who confesses to have “lost the impetus to bother” with dating) set up on Tinder, and the show’s finale, The Change, a tale of one dad’s “unwavering support” of their son through gender transition.

Arsenal? Manchester United? Manchester City? Liverpool? Bayern Munich? Or will he do what Steven Gerrard did post-Istanbul 2005 and go back on the decision to join Chelsea? The price, should anyone wish to pay it, will be commensurate with the £106m it cost Chelsea to buy Enzo Fernández. “I love this club and I love playing for this club,” said Dec in the afterglow of victory. And yet. Related: Real Madrid seal initial €103m deal to buy Jude Bellingham from Dortmund One place young Dec won’t be going is Saudi Arabia, though a swathe of players could still be snapped up by Saudi clubs, particularly in light of Lionel Messi choosing Miami over Mecca. Riyad Mahrez may find Saturday’s Champions League final is his last for Manchester City with Al-Ahli wanting the Algerian. Sergio Busquets, previously linked with a move to Saudi Arabia, could also be heading to Miami along with Ángel Di María, Messi’s old mates from Barça and Argentina respectively. Oh, and Luis Suárez is joining the party, too, having played recently for Grêmio in Brazil. David de Gea, mind, doesn’t fancy leaving Manchester United just yet, or joining Miami, and would rather stay on than head to Saudi. Harry Maguire really wants to leave and Aston Villa are happy to take him, while they are also interested in Pau Torres of Unai Emery’s former club Villarreal. Also heading for the Old Trafford exit will be forgotten man Donny van de Beek. United, meanwhile, have made Kim Min-jae of Napoli a leading target. With a buyout clause of £42m he’s very gettable, though Newcastle, flush with Saudi money, want him too. Here comes another test of how attractive Newcastle can make themselves compared to the traditional elite. Should Kim not land in Manchester then Benjamin Pavard is seen as an alternative target. Yes, really. United maintain an interest in Harry Kane but with Real Madrid and Bayern Munich in the hunt whomever owns the club this summer – that remaining somewhat undecided – may find themselves in a bidding war with the continental giants. Perhaps instead they could turn to Victor Osimhen, the Napoli striker, whose price is lowered to a mere £103m according to reports in Italy. Rather cheaper, though perhaps not in wage terms, is Moussa Dembélé, who has left Lyon on a free. Mason Mount update: he will still cost £70m despite some attempted haggling by United and other suitors for Chelsea’s former future captain. As Arsenal look for powder to fire next season’s attack to winning honours, there’s a clearing of the decks: Albert Sambi Lokonga, Nuno Tavares, Cedric Soares, Charlie Patino, Auston Trusty, Marquinhos, Alex Runarsson, Folarin Balogun and Nicolas Pépé can all go.

The event with Dean Accuri AKA Frock Hudson was targeted by groups after a flyer advertising the event was posted online by fringe actors. In a statement, the City of Port Phillip’s CEO, Chris Carroll, said the event hadn’t yet been approved: A drag storytime at St Kilda library was under consideration as one of these events but had not been approved when a draft flyer for the event was shared with some parents at a library branch yesterday.

Full details will be made available soon on our Port Phillip library service website. Due to security and safety concerns, and to avoid any disruption and distress to young participants and their families, staff and other library users, we will not be holding this event in person. Our drag storytime will instead be made available online for interested families. Carroll said because of the current climate of hate directed towards the LGBTQ+ community, the library would be “proceeding with events differently”. We condemn the hate speech directed to our council, staff, councillors and the performer on this topic.

Speaking on ABC Radio, Watt said Australia was being sensible in calling for geographic indicators not to be used: What we’re asking for is perfectly reasonable, especially when you compare it to what other countries have been able to negotiate with the EU.

Ryan said the daily staff shortages were unprecedented, the staff attrition unsustainable and recruitment was not able to keep pace: The help these young people need and the effective rehabilitation they require are exactly the types of interventions (education, programs, recreation, training, family reconnection and general health and mental health) that have been most heavily impacted by staffing shortages and increased lockdowns.

He said his brother, who fell to his death at a known gay beat at the time after he was punched by White, shone a light on how poorly police investigated the deaths of gay men decades ago. They demonised my family by calling us obsessed. We’ve learned from the commission’s proceedings the New South Wales police had a long contrived plan to go on a television program and defend their investigative work and to cast doubt on our family and on my brother and to try to reinforce their original assessment of suicide. Australians could see that Scott’s case wasn’t the only one. There were hundreds of other victims and dozens of other deaths that had gotten similarly ignored by the police.

Anyway, as we noted in yesterday’s March quarter GDP report, trade subtracted 0.2 percentage points from quarterly growth, which itself came in a weak 0.2%. (Net exports fell, which refers to the difference between exports and imports, not actual nets.)

Seasonally adjusted, the surplus shrank by $3.66bn in April, or about a quarter, to $11.16bn from a revised $14.82bn for March. Exports for the month fell 5% while imports rose 1.6%. Commodity prices bounce around of course but they were generally been coming off their recent peaks, although the red dirt variety has been holding up better.

The Department of Health and Aged Care recorded 17,277 flu cases between May 15 and May 28, which was more than double the previous fortnight’s total. If you’re worried how you’re going to space out the two shots, don’t be – Robson says Covid-19 boosters and flu shots are safe to administer at the same time. We are seeing a significant spike in the number of flu and Covid cases, making this a potentially dangerous winter, particularly for elderly and immunocompromised people. Having a Covid-19 booster and a flu shot at the same time is an effective and safe way of ensuring you are protected from both viruses. Robson said while children under five years of age aren’t badly affected by Covid-19, he stressed influenza can be extremely serious for them. “So it is crucial they get their flu shots as soon as possible,” he said.

Priority areas for renewable energy zone development will be identified by early 2024, with consultation to begin later that year. Regional communities are gearing up for a fight over the hundreds of kilometres of new high-voltage, high-capacity, power lines that will need to be established to transmit wind and solar power to the grid as the state’s remaining coal-fired plants close. The western renewables link, a transmission line intended to carry wind and solar-powered energy from a power station in Bulgana in western Victoria to Sydenham in Melbourne’s north-west, is being fiercely opposed by local communities, who say the 80-metre towers will affect their ability to grow potatoes and will negatively affect land value, liveability and tourism. Here’s a story we wrote on the issue before the 2022 Victorian election: Related: ‘Everyone’s against it’: the powerlines dispute in one of Victoria’s most marginal electorates Updated at 4.06am BST 3.59am BST Victorian government taking control of new transmission projects in the state Victoria’s environment minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, has launched the Victorian Transmission Investment Framework, which will see VicGrid take over from the Australian Energy Market Operator to lead transmission project planning and development. D’Ambrosio says this will ensure local communities, landholders, traditional owners and other stakeholders are consulted on major transmission projects “from start to finish”. Under the new framework, VicGrid will have a physical presence in communities and employ people from the area, in an effort “to build trust and confidence in the planning process”. Local advisory groups will also be set up. VicGrid will also develop a framework for government, industry and community partnerships to ensure that host communities benefit directly and regional development opportunities are maximised. D’Ambrosio said: This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform the way we plan our energy infrastructure with genuine consultation with communities and industry at the heart of the process. As Victoria moves toward 95% renewables by 2035, we have to update and modernise our grid to deliver this cheaper, more reliable energy to homes and businesses across the state.

Data obtained by the Guardian revealed for the first time a breakdown of hate-motivated crimes in New Zealand, with Jewish and Muslim people disproportionately targeted. While there is no specific hate crime offence in New Zealand, after the Islamophobic terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch in 2019 the police began collecting data on whether offending was hate-motivated, as perceived by officers, victims, or witnesses. On Twitter, Faruqi wrote: This lack of information [in Australia] presents a real challenge in addressing racism & preventing extremist violence.

Chinese state media have reported - based on data from China’s General Administration of Customs – that the total value of two-way trade was up 19.4% in the first five months of 2023. The Global Times said China’s imports from Australia grew 21.3% while China’s exports to Australia went up 15.7%. The paper quoted China-based analysts as saying the figures showed the relationship between the two countries was “moving forward steadily”. It also quoted a coal industry figure as saying China imported 6.3m tons of Australian coal, mostly coking coal, between January and April amid resilient domestic demand. In recent days the Australian government welcomed the removal of impediments on fruit exports to China. But the big impediments – including wine and barley tariffs – remain in place. The agriculture minister, Murray Watt, said on ABC Radio National today that the Australian government welcomed progress but continued to press for each trade impediment to be removed.

The trust for the Lismore diocese successfully achieved a permanent stay – or permanently halted – a civil claim brought by survivor GLJ, a woman who alleges she was abused as a 14-year-old by Lismore priest Father Clarence Anderson. The church argued that because Anderson was dead, it could no longer have a fair trial. The New South Wales court of appeal, the state’s highest court, agreed and granted the permanent stay. But GLJ’s counsel, Perry Herzfeld SC, and solicitors, Ken Cush and Associates, have appealed to the high court, arguing the church held a wealth of evidence about Anderson’s abuse of other children and there were four other categories of evidence available to ensure the trial is heard fairly. They argued the church did not need a contrary witness to challenge the plaintiff’s account. Herzfeld said: If defendants decide to contest a plaintiff’s account … they don’t need a contrary witness in order to have a proper basis to do so. They also argue that the decision subverted the intent of state and territory parliaments, which had removed the time limit on bringing civil cases after the royal commission. In doing so, parliaments were emphatic in saying they wanted such cases to proceed to trial, regardless of the effects of any delay. The decision has had widespread ramifications for other cases of clergy and institutional abuse, where the alleged perpetrator has died. Guardian Australia revealed earlier this year that the GLJ ruling had emboldened the church and other institutions to take an aggressive approach to other cases where alleged perpetrators have died, using it to pressure other survivors into accepting low-ball and “paltry” sums of compensation, or face having their case thrown out.

That’s come up because Liberal senator Linda Reynolds says she may raise a government compensation payment made to her former staffer Higgins with the Nacc, highlighting concerns about the speed of the process and the “fairness” of the Labor government’s handling of the case. One of the things about the Anti-Corruption Commission that people mightn’t have noticed in the Coalition is that it’s independent of parliamentarians. And it, in fact, could be regarded as an entirely inappropriate action by the prime minister or any other politician for that matter, to try to direct the Anti-Corruption Commission into what to do. We set it up as an independent body. The former government, of course, promised one in 2018 and didn’t deliver one. We have delivered one. Pressed to weigh in on the matter Albanese says: You’re asking me to do something that is entirely inappropriate because the Anti-Corruption Commission is independent of politics. That’s the idea. If it’s in with politics, that itself is a problem. 2.38am BST PM says he has ‘absolute confidence’ in Katy Gallagher after her name appeared in Higgins texts Albanese has expressed his confidence in the ministers in his government whose names have come up in text exchanges between Brittany Higgins and her partner, David Sharaz. The Australian this morning reports that text messages the pair suggested they had contact with senior Labor politicians, including the now finance minister, Katy Gallagher, who the couple believed could support her claim. Albanese: I have absolute confidence in Senator Gallagher. Asked about his own connections, Albanese said: I don’t take advice from anyone.

The premier said he would continue to respond to any questions posed by the former Liberal minister turned independent in written form but would not pretend the charges against him did not exist. Minns said: He still faces very serious charges and while I make absolutely no judgment about those charges and the eventual case that needs to take place, I’m also not going to pretend that they don’t exist. The most appropriate thing to do in what is an unusual set of circumstances is to follow the advice of the privileges committee, continue to take his questions on notice, report back to the parliament so that the people of Kiama can know what the government’s position is, but also and importantly, not accept his vote. Ward is before the courts on sexual assault charges. He has pleaded not guilty and has previously said he looked forward to proving his innocence in court. The parliamentary privileges committee last night handed down its report that found there were risks of legal action against the parliament by a suspended member, risks to the constituents by not being represented in parliament for a prolonged period of time, and risks to the criminal court processes that could be delayed.

Police will ramp up road safety efforts across the state from Friday in an attempt to reduce road trauma after the number of lives lost surged by 35% compared with the same period last year. Excessive speed and distracted driving have been blamed after nearly 30 people were killed on Victorian roads in May alone, more than double the same month last year. Police say other contributing factors to the alarming increase include seatbelt non-compliance, disobeying traffic signs and unauthorised driving, which includes being suspended, disqualified or unlicensed. This will be a key focus as officers kick off a road safety blitz known as Operation Regal across major roads and highways this long weekend, which has been identified as a high-risk period on state roads. Acting assistant commissioner of road policing Martin O’Brien said: Long weekends are historically high-risk on our roads, and the King’s Birthday long weekend can present additional challenges. Wintry weather can increase the likelihood of a collision, with slippery roads and poor visibility. Police issued more than 5000 infringement notices during a similar operation last year. More than 40 per cent were motorists caught speeding, and 372 were busted for drink- and drug-driving offences. 1.44am BST No decision on Warragamba Dam safety risk, premier says The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, said a decision has not yet been reached on what to do about a safety risk presented by a fault in the Warragamba Dam wall.

The group says a surge in overseas migrants and international students coupled with a significant shortfall in rental listings was what led to the strongest annual rental increase on record for Australia’s capital cities. The increases come despite CoreLogic’s national rental index showing the rate of rental growth has softened slightly, with rents up 0.8% in May compared to the 0.9% and 1% increases in April and March respectively. CoreLogic’s Mapping the Market tool showed 44.4% of house and unit markets recorded a rental increase of 10% or more in the year to May. Of the 3,812 markets analysed, 6.7% recorded a decline in rents for the period. CoreLogic Economist Kaytlin Ezzy said: In the past year we’ve seen rents increase in every capital and rest of state region except for Canberra where there’s been a -1.9% decline. Canberra was previously the country’s most expensive rental city until Sydney overtook it in December. The softening rental conditions in the ACT is likely due to there being more stock on the market. Canberra’s vacancy rate has increased from 0.7% in March 2022 to 2.2%, putting it second behind Hobart (2.7%). More stock means tenants have more choice and potentially more power when negotiating their rent.

He said, “I don’t think you should be at work, you should be at home.” This was many, many years ago, of course, before I was a politician but I know the trauma that goes through with women. It is heartbreaking, it is very hurtful and you’re in shock and you don’t know what to do.

The Australian this morning reports that text messages between Higgins and boyfriend David Sharaz have suggested the pair had contact with senior Labor politicians who the couple believed could support the claim. Lisa Millar: You’re confident of that, though? You’re confident you have all the information you need? Dreyfus: I made the decision to settle this claim in accordance with the legal services direction. It was an entirely regular decision. None of those texts are new.

As my colleague Josh Butler reports this morning, Reynolds says she may raise a government compensation payment made to her former staffer Brittany Higgins with the Nacc, highlighting concerns about the speed of the process and the “fairness” of the Labor government’s handling of the case.

Lehrmann was charged but vehemently denied the allegations and maintained his innocence. The initial trial was aborted last year due to jury misconduct and prosecutors dropped the charges against Lehrmann amid concerns about the impact a second trial could have on Higgins’ mental health. Dreyfus says: This decision, which I made, was made as in exactly the same way as attorneys general for many, many years, under the legal services direction. It was an entirely regular decision. And Linda Reynolds can do what she likes. Anyone is free to make a referral to the National Anti-Corruption Commission if that’s what she wants to do. It’s an independent decision by the National Anti-Corruption Commission and I have made it very, very clear, I’m not going have quotes about what the National Anti-Corruption Commission should or not be doing. Updated at 12.08am BST 11.37pm BST A quarter of homes are bought mortgage-free, property data firm says More than a quarter of homes were bought without a mortgage last year, suggesting there’s a sizeable cohort insulated from aggressive interest rate rises, AAP reports. Roughly 25% of all sales in the eastern states – both dwellings and land – were made without a mortgage, according to the property data firm PEXA. The analysis suggests the proportion of cash purchases has stayed relatively stable since before the arrival of Covid-19 but the total value has been trending higher since the pandemic property boom. About $122.5bn worth of homes were cash funded in 2022, making up 25.6% of all residential sales in NSW, Queensland and Victoria. This was slightly less than the $124.8bn worth of housing exchanged without a home loan in 2021 but well above the $83.6bn recorded in 2020. PEXA head of research Mike Gill said the data suggested most cash buyers were older homeowners who had already paid off their mortgages and were buying a home to retire in. Updated at 11.53pm BST 11.30pm BST ‘There’s no place in Australia for people who want to glorify the horrors of the Holocaust’ Attorney general Mark Dreyfus says the rise in far-right violent activity prompted the move to ban Nazi symbols. He tells ABC News: We think this is a very small number of people, in fact I’m hoping it’s getting smaller and it will eventually disappear. We need to send a message there’s no place in Australia for this kind of behaviour. There’s no place in Australia for people who want to glorify the horrors of the Holocaust. It would have been unthinkable, going back a few decades. It’s concerning it’s crept a little bit into the life of our country. Dreyfus will introduce a bill next week to make it an offence to publicly display the Nazi Hakenkreuz – the swastika – and the SS Schutzstaffel symbol, or things that closely resemble them, but not the salute: That’s more a matter for state governments. We don’t have Australian federal police on the street. There’s state police on the street dealing with street behaviour like this. It’s better dealt with by state laws.

Well now we have more details to reveal about what those issues were and how WaterNSW and Dam Safety NSW are examining them: Related: Integrity of Sydney’s main Warragamba dam at risk from extreme flooding, says study To be clear, there is no immediate threat to the wall but the extensive work that will be done to understand the nature of risk could eventually result in work to thicken or buttress the wall. At this stage, raising its height – the subject of much debate – is not being contemplated, water minister Rose Jackson tells us. A better understanding of the parameters around climate change and how it might worsen very extreme and rare flood events is part of the reason for the reassessment. Work to understand what raising the dam wall would mean for the seam that the wall sits on was another prompt for the review, according to WaterNSW.

The geographic indicators (the naming rights to foods including feta and prosecco) are the sticking point potentially blocking access for Australian products to European markets. The agriculture minister, Murray Watt, says Australia has said it could walk away from the deal if it can’t get the kind of market access it is seeking. He’s telling ABC Radio about the outcome of two days of trade talks in Brussels: I actually spoke to Don Farrell, the trade minister, last night. He’s just finished two days of trade talks in Brussels … negotiations that he’s just undertaken have reached a difficult stage. We’ve obviously been very clear about our position from the beginning of these negotiations that we really need to see some commercially meaningful expansion of new markets for our producers for this deal to be worth doing … We’re not going to do with the or just for the sake of doing a deal, it’s got to be in Australia’s interests as well as being in the EU’s interests.

Billions of dollars in oil and gas undermine the investment bank’s net zero commitments, according to a report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Known as the millionaire factory, Macquarie has almost $5bn invested in oil and gas companies that will produce gigatonnes of greenhouse gases from new developments, the research released today found. Institute chief executive and research co-author Amandine Denis-Ryan said: Our analysis finds that Macquarie Group’s actions directly contradict its climate commitments. The shares and bonds include $3.5bn across 11 oil majors with expansion plans that are incompatible with the international pact on limiting global warming. There is also about $1.4bn invested as significant stakes in smaller oil and gas companies. The report also found that the target Macquarie has set for its oil and gas activities could encourage the financing of new gas projects so as to cut the average emissions intensity of the fossil fuel portfolio. The investments identified add up to about $5bn, while the group disclosed only $1.2bn of financing exposure across the oil and gas value chain. These numbers are significantly larger than the disclosed exposure by Australia’s largest banks, that is CBA ($2.1bn), NAB ($1.9bn) and Westpac ($1.9bn), the report said. Macquarie signed up to the international Net Zero Banking Alliance in 2021, which committed the group to having a lending and investment portfolio in line with limiting global warming to below 1.5 degrees. Updated at 10.11pm BST 9.54pm BST Quad countries urged to boost naval cooperation A new paper says the Quad grouping of Australia, Japan, India and the US is not living up to its full potential. The paper, published today by the United States Studies Centre, is titled “Bolstering the Quad: The case for a collective approach to maritime security”. It says: Although the Quad has emerged as a bulwark of a free, open and resilient Indo-Pacific and a leading provider of public goods, it is not living up to its potential as a contributor to regional security and defence in the maritime domain. This is a problem for Indo-Pacific security. Given its member states’ collective military heft and stated interest in upholding a favourable balance of power in the region, the Quad has a vital role to play in preserving stability and deterring major power aggression. The paper does not argue the Quad should pursue a formal collective defence arrangement – but says the four countries should better “network” their strengths. The paper nominates five high-priority areas: maritime domain awareness, anti-submarine warfare, maritime logistics, defence industrial and technological cooperation, and maritime capacity building. The recommendations include that Australia, Japan, India and the US “develop the collective capacity to seamlessly refuel, resupply and repair maritime assets from any member on short notice, and formally commit to this agenda at the political and operational levels”. 9.40pm BST Coalition slams ‘delay’ in extra help for Ukraine The Coalition has accused the Albanese government of “delaying the delivery of further assistance to Ukraine despite urgent calls for support”. But the government hit back at the criticism, saying it “continues to engage with the government of Ukraine and our allies and partners to ensure meaningful support continues to be provided to Ukraine in its ongoing battle against Russian aggression”. The Coalition is today calling on the government to give urgent consideration to a package including Hawkei vehicles, M1 Abrams Tanks, F/A-18 Hornets and humanitarian aid. It also urged the government to reinstate the Australian embassy in Kyiv. The shadow foreign affairs minister, Simon Birmingham, and the shadow defence minister, Andrew Hastie, accused the government of waiting until Anthony Albanese attends a summit in Lithuania in mid-July: The prime minister is holding support ransom until he has a media opportunity at the upcoming Nato summit. This is unacceptable – military and humanitarian aid should not be withheld based on the news cycle. The Albanese government must not fatigue in its support of Ukraine. This government puts Australia’s reputation as a reliable and trusted partner at risk. A spokesperson for the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, said: It is disappointing the Coalition are seeking to play politics with such an important matter. The government has engaged the Coalition in briefings and the like to ensure there is bipartisan support on this issue. So far, Australia has committed about $680m of support to Ukraine, a figure that includes more than $510m in military assistance. Promises to date include the supply of 90 Bushmaster protected mobility vehicles, the majority of which are said to have arrived in Ukraine. 9.31pm BST Welcome Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage. This is Martin Farrer bringing you some early morning headlines before Natasha May takes the reins soon. Successive rate hikes by the RBA have brought the cost-of-living crisis into sharp relief and our main story today is the “mortgage cliff” facing thousands of households as they come off fixed-rate deals to more expensive variable loans. We’ve talked to a family facing a massive struggle to make ends meet with their repayments about to rise by $2,000 a month, while economists are warning that the country is already in a “retail recession” as spending slumps. We know that Paul Keating thinks the Aukus pact is a bad idea because he said so in a speech at the National Press Club a few months ago. What we didn’t know until today was that, just hours before his speech, the former prime minister sent a furious broadside to the Albanese cabinet to warn about what he sees as the “dangerous” policy of aligning with the US and UK against China in the Pacific. We’ve got a FOI exclusive here. The federal government announced late last night that it will ban Nazi symbols with a punishment of up to a year in prison – but it will not ban the Nazi salute. The move by the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, follows controversy in March over what he called a failure by the Coalition to condemn people who used a Nazi salute at an anti-trans rights rally on the steps of the Victorian parliament in Melbourne.

Earth has been conquered and renamed iPlanet. Only a group of badly dressed rock’n’rollers called the Bohemians can save it from the clutches of Killer Queen (Loose Woman Brenda Edwards) – boo – and Khashoggi (Lee Mead) – hiss. They are the baddies in this futuristic panto – there really is an urge to boo and hiss at them. The goodies come in the shape of odd couple Scaramouche (Elena Skye), who hopes people won’t mistake her name for “scary bush”, and Galileo Figaro (Ian McIntosh), who has a wobbly Long Island accent and an uncertain look: he might be a 1980s rocker but may just as easily have stepped out of Happy Days. They plod through a threadbare plot with bursts of spurious song, with leading dialogue such as: “Are you ready to break free?” (cue music). We are grateful for the singing though because the Queen songs – from A Kind of Magic to Don’t Stop Me Now – are effectively sung on the whole. Moving … Brian May performs during the finale. Photograph: David M Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images Elton, directing, also makes his stage acting debut as the Rebel Leader, an old hippy previously known as Pop and played by Nigel Planer, and seems as if he has wandered into a musical to perform his standup material. The riff on iPlanet’s “dark digital age” sounds like a luddite’s whinge about a past more wholesome than the present. The Bohemians hark back to the Beatles and Elvis, who they take great delight in calling Pelvis – a standard example of the show’s humour. Whatever the probability of our robot future, Elton’s book is cheesy enough to make a bot’s toes curl. The set combines the aesthetics of an arcade game with a Kraftwerk concert. It is still plain to see why the show endured for its original 12-year run at the Dominion: the songs transcend their context and keep their rousing, big stadium sound. It is moving when Brian May appears on stage to play his guitar to Bohemian Rhapsody at the end, too, but the journey here has been quite a trudge. In a preamble, Elton’s Rebel Leader talks of less than flattering reviews of the original production. In this critic’s view, it’s a case of going back to that future for iPlanet’s shaggy bohemians.

The world is rapidly running out of “carbon budget”, the amount of carbon dioxide that can be poured into the atmosphere if we are to stay within the vital threshold of 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures, according to a study published in the journal Earth System Science Data on Thursday. Only about 250bn tonnes of carbon dioxide can now be emitted, to avoid the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere that would raise temperatures by 1.5C. That is down from 500bn tonnes just a few years ago, and at current annual rates of greenhouse gas emissions, of about 54bn tonnes a year over the past decade, it would run out well before the end of this decade. Prof Piers Forster, the director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures at the University of Leeds, and lead author of the paper, said: “This is the critical decade for climate change. Decisions made now will have an impact on how much temperatures will rise and the degree and severity of impacts we will see as a result.” He said the rate of annual increase in emissions had slowed down, but far stronger action was needed. “We need to change policy and approaches in light of the latest evidence about the state of the climate system. Time is no longer on our side,” he said. Governments are meeting in Bonn to prepare for a major UN summit on the climate, Cop28, this November in the United Arab Emirates. Cop28 is seen as one of the last opportunities for the world to get on track to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, and stay within 1.5C. Sultan Al Jaber, the president-designate of Cop28, will arrive at Bonn on Thursday, under pressure to produce a plan for the talks that will achieve the “course correction” he has called for. While heading the talks, Al Jaber has retained his role as head of UAE’s national oil company, Adnoc, which is planning to increase its oil and gas production capacity. Al Jaber has previously told the Guardian that his dual role is a benefit to the talks, as he will bring a “business mindset” and galvanise the private sector. Major figures in the talks, including John Kerry of the US and Frans Timmermans of the EU, have praised him. Campaigners remain unconvinced, however, and are planning a protest in Bonn on Thursday against the perceived conflict of interest in Al Jaber’s role. At Cop28, nations will undertake a “global stocktake” for the first time since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015, to assess whether they are on track to meet their commitments to cut emissions. That stocktake is likely to show the world is far off track, as the paper published on Thursday also shows. Greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise, despite a sharp fall in 2020 when Covid lockdowns were in place in many countries. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change calculated in 2018 that the world must nearly halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared with 2010 levels, in order to stay within the 1.5C threshold, and reach net zero emissions by 2050. But that calculation rested on an assumption that the world would reduce emissions by about 7% a year during the 2020s. As emissions have continued to rise, the annual rate of decline for emissions will now have to be much steeper to stay within the 1.5C limit. Joeri Rogelj, co-author of the new paper and a professor of climate science at Imperial College London, told the Guardian: “The years of continued high emissions as the updates the remaining carbon budget mean that by now we should be doing more. That means either moving forward the global goal net zero date for CO2 from around 2050 to about 2035, or cutting much deeper by 2030.” Earlier this year, the International Energy Agency found that emissions from energy – the biggest source of emissions – were showing signs of reaching a plateau. But only 18 countries have shown sustained decreases in their emissions. Majid Al Suwaidi, the director general of Cop28 and one of the top aides to Al Jaber, told the Guardian that UAE would not be using the global stocktake to name and shame the nations that were missing their pledges under the Paris agreement, or failing to cut emissions fast enough. “Climate change is one of those things where we’re all interconnected,” he said. “We can’t solve the problem individually. We have to solve as a collective. That’s what makes it difficult. And so there’s no simple bad guy, good guy in this discussion. Everybody has their solutions. Everybody has their ideas. And if we can bring people together behind those sort of common solutions, and drive the agenda behind that, that becomes a real powerful moment. And that’s what we’re trying to achieve at Cop28.”","Id":"environment/2023/jun/08/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-at-all-time-high-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webTitle":"Global greenhouse gas emissions at all-time high, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-at-all-time-high-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jun/08/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-at-all-time-high-study-finds","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":833,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T08:00:01Z","id":"environment/2023/jun/08/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-at-all-time-high-study-finds","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Being Human by Lewis Dartnell review – how our biology shaped history","body":"I blame Yuval Noah Harari. Since the Israeli historian’s bestselling Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind in 2011, there has been a trend for thick tomes proposing to explain our humanity through one or other lens across deep time. Just this year, we have had books about how human history was shaped by epidemic disease (Jonathan Kennedy’s Pathogenesis), or by climate variation (Peter Frankopan’s The Earth Transformed). Now Lewis Dartnell, author of the brilliant The Knowledge: How to Rebuild Our World from Scratch, and the Harari-adjacent Origins: How the Earth Made Us (on how human history was shaped by the planetary environment), offers a new take on the same old same old. Are there any surprising angles left? Despite the relentless news of war and mass murder, for one thing, it is good for someone to remind us – as Sverker Johansson also did in his The Dawn of Language – that we are actually unusually peaceful, for apes. (Even free-loving bonobos are much more physically violent to one another.) In Dartnell’s intriguing opening argument, our prehistoric forebears suppressed reactive aggression in favour of “planned proactive aggression”, used only to punish norm-violators, and so constructed a civilisation built on amazing levels of cooperation and reciprocity. We proceed to examine the influence on history of family attachments (as mediated, it is somewhat simplistically explained, by the hormone oxytocin), including the “prudently plotted marriages” that led to the Habsburgs dominating Europe from the 16th century, or the long demographic reverberations of the mass destruction of young men in war. We consider the historical and geographical distribution of practices of monogamy versus polygamy, the latter being – so the author argues – what humans have a natural “predilection” for, but only if resources allow. “At the time of writing, Elon Musk has a personal net worth of over a quarter of a trillion dollars,” Dartnell observes with a straight face. “With this fortune he could materially support hundreds of thousands of wives, utterly overshadowing the harems of the greatest despots of history.” Always an interesting and engaging writer, Dartnell avoids the feeling of dutifully ticking off bits of bio-history, and finds fascinating nuggets in familiar stories: the Black Death, for example, killed nearly half the population of London in 1348. In his chapters on disease, he also discusses how the first plan to build a Panama canal – by the Scots in the 1 7th century – was scuppered by malaria and yellow fever, the financial losses thus incurred partly leading to the Act of Union. The threat of contagion, he argues, also “led the colonial powers to operate extractive strategies” in subtropical regions, clinging to coastal ports and shipping out sugar and coffee, rather than settling inland as in more friendly climates such as New Zealand or Canada. We get a chapter on the social and geopolitical effects of humans wanting to get off their faces on alcohol, or mildly stimulated by tea, coffee and tobacco; and one on how defects or omissions in our DNA may have changed history. Humans’ unusual inability to make their own vitamin C inside the body, for example, led to the lemon juice-quaffing sailors of the Royal Navy having a distinct advantage over the scurvy-ridden French and Spanish at Trafalgar. (Happily, our author does not shrink from calling the navy’s adoption of lemon rations a “sea change”.) Lest this all smack too much of biological determinism, Dartnell spends a short coda wisely emphasising how human culture and technology have freed us from the raw dictates of the body. Indeed, as he notes, culture has already changed our biology in significant ways, such as when many humans began drinking the milk of domesticated cows 10,000 years ago, selecting for the persistence of the milk-digesting lactase enzyme into adulthood in many populations. Medicine and contraception, meanwhile, liberate modern humans from the meat-grinder of normal evolutionary change. So are we really essentially the same animals as the early Homo sapiens hunting and gathering on the savannahs? Dartnell thinks so. “The fundamental aspects of what it means to be human – the hardware of our bodies and the software of our minds – haven’t changed.” This is, indeed, the assumption behind evolutionary psychology, which seeks to explain modern human behaviour in terms of what is hypothesised to have been adaptive for our cave-dwelling ancestors. But his mainframe-age metaphor of hardware and software is old hat and inaccurate. We now know that the human brain exhibits substantial neuroplasticity: in other words, the “software” can change the “hardware” it’s running on, as is not the case for any actual computer. This “software” can also correct itself, which is to say that our thinking is corrigible: a fact that seems obvious in light of the history of disciplines such as mathematics, engineering, or indeed biology itself. Yet Dartnell, despite accepting the facts of cultural evolution, still avers that our “cognitive operating system has not had an update”, and worse, that we can’t do anything about many of its most characteristic errors. This is the burden of his penultimate chapter about the familiar subject of cognitive biases. Deducing from news reports about violent crime that humans are unusually violent primates, for example, would be a case of “availability bias” – we attach more importance to examples of nastiness we can easily think of (those more “available” to memory) than to the untold examples of people being nice to each other that don’t make the headlines. It is also widely counted as a cognitive bias that humans are “loss averse”, meaning that we weigh potential losses in a bet more heavily than equivalent potential gains – but that should be no surprise to anyone who genuinely can’t afford to lose their shirt, rather than undergraduates in elite western universities playing for toy money in psychology experiments. Dartnell, though, seems to take his view on loss aversion and the other biases mainly from Daniel Kahneman, who with Amos Tversky first developed the literature on them and wrote them up for a general audience in 2011’s Thinking, Fast and Slow, and who was himself notably pessimistic about the prospects of our learning to escape their clutches in our ordinary reasoning. Dartnell agrees, leaving little hope for the future. “We have seemingly been hardwired,” he writes, “with a number of cognitive biases that impede our ability to take appropriate action to address seemingly distant, gradual and complex challenges such as climate change.” But “hardwired” is another inexact computing metaphor, and many others believe that becoming aware of cognitive biases can enable us to avoid falling into their traps. There is evidence to suggest that conscious “debiasing” training can reduce susceptibility to biases over the medium term; and the particular scourge of online misinformation designed to appeal to our biases may be vulnerable to interventions in which those tricks are explained to citizens. That, in the form of a recent research initiative by the universities of Cambridge and Bristol, is known as “inoculation science”: one way, perhaps, in which a metaphor from biology can signal a way forward for our culture. • Being Human: How Our Biology Shaped World History is published by Bodley Head (£22).

The survey by the trade body showed that a third (33%) of people think that books offer them the best form of escapism when they’re having a bad day, coming second only to watching television (54%). Streaming services, looking at social media, listening to the radio and going to the pub or cinema were all less popular methods of escapism than reading, found the survey of more than 2,200 adults across the UK. People were also asked what they do with books they’ve read, and the results suggest that they “overwhelmingly” keep, reuse or recycle them. The poll, in which respondents were able to choose more than one answer, found that 41% of people keep books for themselves, while 34% pass them on to friends and family members. Books are a great way for us all to escape from our everyday routines Dan Conway, CEO of the Publishers Association A third said they give their used books to charity shops, while 12% sell them online. Only 7% of people said that they throw books out. Dan Conway, CEO of the Publishers Association, said the survey “not only shows the importance of books to people’s mental health and wellbeing, but is a testament to their longevity and value”. “Books are a great way for us all to escape from our everyday routines, and if we are able to share that with our friends, families, and more widely, we could be making a huge difference to people’s lives without even realising it,” he continued, adding that the “UK publishing industry is booming”. Last year was a record-breaking one for the publishing industry: total income in 2022 was £6.9bn, with sales up 4% from 2021; 669m physical books were sold in the UK in 2022, the highest overall level ever recorded. The industry also saw an 8% increase in exports, taking the total sales to £4.1bn, with Alice Oseman’s Heartstopper series of graphic novels the biggest book export of 2022. The poll coincides with the launch of the association’s Insights Dashboard for publishers, where they can look at trend data for the last six years.","Id":"books/2023/jun/08/one-in-three-say-books-offer-best-form-of-escapism-when-having-a-bad-day","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"One in three say books offer best form of escapism when having a bad day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/08/one-in-three-say-books-offer-best-form-of-escapism-when-having-a-bad-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/jun/08/one-in-three-say-books-offer-best-form-of-escapism-when-having-a-bad-day","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts","wordcount":357,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T08:00:00Z","id":"books/2023/jun/08/one-in-three-say-books-offer-best-form-of-escapism-when-having-a-bad-day","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Labour aims to reform England’s adult social care sector if it wins election","body":"Significant reform of England’s beleaguered adult social care sector could be ushered in by the next Labour government under plans that include boosting pay for care workers, expanding the scope of free support, and a £50 weekly contribution towards costs for those who need it. A report by the Fabian Society thinktank, requested by the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, and commissioned by the trade union Unison, sets out a roadmap for a national care service (NCS) that is hoped would address the existing patchy, impersonal and inadequate state provision. A 10-year government spending commitment would be required to fix the social care crisis, with a promise to increase real-terms funding for adult social care by a significant percentage each year, the report says. However, it argues that simply pumping more money into the system will not be enough and that comprehensive change is required. Crucially, this should take place at the same time as making changes to the charging structure to avoid “an unnecessary hurdle” in changing the system. Related: Ministers seek volunteer social care army to speed up hospital discharges It warns: “There is no quick fix for our social care emergency. Unless we take significant and sustained action over many years things will get worse for all of us.” The report, which sources said had the support of many on the Labour frontbench although they are not expected to support all of the recommendations, stresses that the dismal state of the nation’s finances means changes will have to be staggered – with bigger spending commitments on hold until the economy recovers. It does not give a figure for how much the new service for England would cost but says this should be informed by an independent assessment of cost pressures in adult social care at the time. An early priority after the general election, expected next year, will be to draw up an emergency workforce package, with the tight labour market meaning the sector is struggling to fill 165,000 vacancies. This could include a minimum wage and working conditions across the sector, initially on an opt-out basis; however, Labour has said it wants to legislate for binding sector-wide fair pay agreements. The report also proposes care workers getting parity with equivalent skilled staff in the NHS on pay bands, pension entitlements and employment terms over time, starting with the lowest paid. Labour could improve access to care in the months after the election, ending the situation where some local authorities unofficially ration support. Under the plan, support would be available to everyone regardless of their means, and at an earlier stage. The proposed NCS would bring national government, local councils and contracted care providers under one umbrella, with independent providers fairly funded but expected to operate as part of a public service with new standards on workforce, care and financial conduct. Longer term, in the run-up to the NHS’s 80th anniversary in 2028, the report suggests that if the Conservatives commit to finally bringing in the delayed plan for a £86,000 cap on how much individuals have to spend on personal care over their lifetime, then Labour should stick with the plans. Labour should make all short-term support and care free, especially during the first six weeks after hospital discharge. Not all of this support is available under the existing system. In addition, it should uprate thresholds in existing means-testing rules every year. However, the authors suggest that if the Dilnot reforms are not yet on track, despite them being scheduled for 2025-26, then a new Labour government should conduct a “short, sharp review” of reforms to the charging system. This includes a proposal for a universal contribution to help fund the system so everybody who needs support can receive some financial help. Options could include a weekly cash contribution of £25 to £50, a percentage contribution to the cost, or a weekly charge cap, which already exists in Wales. Streeting said: “This report is an important contribution to the debate on our social care system. Labour is committed to ensuring better terms and conditions, proper training and fair pay for care workers, with national standards guaranteeing good quality care, as the first steps to building a national care service.” Andrew Harrop, the general secretary of the Fabian Society, said: “This comprehensive plan for a national care service for England is an ambitious roadmap for solving one of the country’s most significant and enduring social challenges.” A Labour spokesperson said: “This report is not Labour party policy and everything in our manifesto will be fully costed and fully funded.” • This article was amended on 8 June 2023. An earlier version said incorrectly that people would be asked to contribute £50 a week towards costs.","Id":"society/2023/jun/08/labour-unveils-plan-to-fix-social-care-better-pay-and-free-short-term-support","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Labour aims to reform England’s adult social care sector if it wins election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/08/labour-unveils-plan-to-fix-social-care-better-pay-and-free-short-term-support","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/jun/08/labour-unveils-plan-to-fix-social-care-better-pay-and-free-short-term-support","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":776,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T07:49:03Z","id":"society/2023/jun/08/labour-unveils-plan-to-fix-social-care-better-pay-and-free-short-term-support","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"The best films of 2023 so far","body":"Alcarràs Carla Simón’s award-winning story of a peach farmer struggling to make ends meet asks many important questions about our relationship with the land and the human cost of progress.

That’s where he will play this summer after it was confirmed Inter Miami have won the race to sign arguably the greatest player of all time. It is the biggest transfer in Major League Soccer history. Bigger even than David Beckham’s move to Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007. Beckham changed the soccer landscape in the US. His move to the Galaxy didn’t just push MLS into the American mainstream, it made the league a viable destination for some of the sport’s most recognisable names, and they don’t come more recognisable than Messi. Beckham, an Inter Miami co-owner, has brought things full circle by getting the GOAT to MLS. Inter Miami chased Messi for years. When the franchise was awarded an MLS expansion spot in 2018, the Argentinian congratulated Beckham. “Who knows, maybe in a few years you can give me a ring,” he said in a social media video. When Messi left Barcelona in 2021, Inter Miami were quickly on the phone to make an offer, although he chose Paris Saint-Germain, where Beckham also once played. Earlier this year, Beckham attended a PSG training session and was pictured with Messi – a move to Inter Miami was surely mentioned. Related: Lionel Messi confirms he will spurn Barcelona and Saudis for Inter Miami in MLS Inter Miami were built around the idea Messi would one day join the club. Xavi Asensi was hired from Barcelona as the club’s chief business officer while Victor Oliver, another former Barça executive, was named a senior vice-president. Recent reports suggest the former Argentina and Barcelona coach Tata Martino has been approached about the club’s managerial vacancy. Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba and Luis Suárez have also been linked with a move to Inter Miami, who may end up looking like a Messi And Friends XI. On the pitch, Inter Miami are in bad shape. At PSG Messi lined up alongside Neymar and Kylian Mbappé, in Miami he will be a teammate of Robert Taylor, once of Lincoln City and Barnet. Messi may have to win games on his own to push his team up the table: they are bottom of the Eastern Conference and on a run of five straight league defeats. There are also questions over whether Inter Miami’s temporary 18,000-capacity DRV PNK Stadium in Fort Lauderdale will be suitable for the coming circus. Could the much larger Hard Rock Stadium, home of the NFL’s Miami Dolphins, host some Inter Miami matches to sell more tickets? The appetite certainly appears to be there: Forbes reported that the cheapest tickets on resale websites for Messi’s possible home debut in August are exchanging hands for more than $500. Messi’s signing is about much more than just Inter Miami though. MLS has pulled all sorts of levers to make a deal for the World Cup winner possible because it believes he will kickstart a new phase of growth for the league, just as Beckham did 16 years ago. MLS has generally moved beyond its previous dependence on aging stars to attract new fans, but Messi is different – he can move the needle like nobody else. Beckham changed the league. MLS grew from 13 teams at the time of his signing to the current number of 29 – the league’s 30th franchise will join in 2025. Beckham sold 300,000 LA Galaxy jerseys a season during his five-and-a-half years at the club. He appeared on late-night talkshows and in adverts with NFL stars. Without the Englishman’s star power, MLS would look very different. Lionel Messi, David Beckham and Italy’s Marco Verratti at a Paris Saint-Germain training session in April. Photograph: Aurélien Meunier/PSG/Getty Images With the 2026 World Cup, which the US will co-host with Canada and Mexico, on the horizon, and with Messi now an MLS player, the drive for growth in soccer in the US will reach new levels over the next three years. If MLS is to become one of the strongest leagues in the world, this period will be crucial. The allure of Miami itself should not be ignored. He already owns property there and his family are said to enjoy the city, which has a large Spanish-speaking population: language barriers should not be a problem for the Messis. The governing body of Argentinian soccer also plans to build a facility in Miami, and more and more South Americans are joining MLS. It’s possible Apple factored this, and the signing of Messi, into its decision to sign a record-breaking $2.5bn broadcast contract with MLS last year. Messi will reportedly receive a percentage of new MLS Season Pass subscriptions. A documentary series on the 35-year-old has already been ordered. AppleTV+ will essentially become MessiTV+. A percentage of Adidas jersey sales is also believed to be included in the unprecedented commercial package put together by MLS for Messi. The Argentinian’s face is already plastered on billboards around the world, but now it will be used to sell MLS – and the player himself appears to be banking on his own celebrity to make his time in the league as lucrative as possible. Never before has MLS given up so much to sign a player. Beckham had the chance to purchase a franchise for just $25m as part of his LA Galaxy contract, with the clause activated to create Inter Miami, but Messi’s overall package could be worth a lot more. “We have been pretty effective at coming up with clever ways to sign players for our clubs in the right market,” said MLS commissioner Don Garber earlier this year, hinting at the creativity used to draw up Messi’s deal. It will be worth it if Messi makes the impact so many expect him to. “I think of him as someone who crosses so many barriers that he can be bigger than any athlete of any sport that has ever played here in the United States,” said Garber. If Beckham’s move to MLS highlighted the potential of the league and soccer in the US, Messi could be the one who fully realises it.","Id":"football/2023/jun/08/bigger-than-beckham-messi-has-the-power-to-realise-soccers-potential-in-the-us","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webTitle":"Bigger than Beckham: Messi has the power to realise soccer’s potential in the US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/08/bigger-than-beckham-messi-has-the-power-to-realise-soccers-potential-in-the-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/jun/08/bigger-than-beckham-messi-has-the-power-to-realise-soccers-potential-in-the-us","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport","wordcount":979,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T07:15:02Z","id":"football/2023/jun/08/bigger-than-beckham-messi-has-the-power-to-realise-soccers-potential-in-the-us","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Poland deports Russian man who claimed to have been FSB officer","body":"Poland has deported a purported former Russian FSB officer who sought asylum in the country back to Russia, accusing him of lying about his past and background. Emran Navruzbekov claimed to have been a senior officer in Russia’s FSB security service in the southern region of Dagestan, and had recently given numerous media interviews about FSB operations and alleged misdeeds. He was handed over to Russia at Poland’s land border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on Tuesday. The move prompted outrage from one of Navruzbekov’s lawyers, who said he faced the risk of jail, torture or worse back in Russia, and that the decision came as a surprise given that Poland is one of the most vocal critics of the Russian regime. A spokesperson for the Polish border guard confirmed in an emailed statement that Navruzbekov was deported on Tuesday, after it was found that he “posed a threat to the defence, state security or the protection of public order”, adding that he had been banned from entering Poland and the Schengen area for 10 years. “The foreign citizen was deported from Poland to his country of origin, which is Russia,” said the border guard statement. Navruzbekov fled Russia in 2017, apparently as he was being prepared for an FSB mission to follow exiles in Turkey. After several years living in Europe without his name being public, last December he gave a long interview to Vladimir Osechkin, founder of the organisation gulagu.net, which has worked extensively with defecting Russian soldiers. The video interview, which has been viewed almost 1m times on YouTube, described Navruzbekov as “a 2022 version of Litvinenko”, who had provided valuable information on the crimes of the Russian regime. Emran Navruzbekov in a video interview. Photograph: No Gulag Official channel Navruzbekov subsequently spoke to various media outlets, and said he feared he may face consequences for his disclosures. “Of course I am afraid. I know how they work. History says that in any case I will be killed,” he told CNN in January. However, in mid-May he was arrested by Polish authorities and told he would be deported. He was placed in a detention centre while his appeal was processed, but his lawyers believed they had until mid-August to appeal against the decision, and had lodged an emergency request for a hearing to prevent the deportation at the European court of human rights on Tuesday morning. Before the appeal could be heard, news came that he had already been deported. Karinna Moskalenko, a well-known Russian human rights lawyer who is part of Navruzbekov’s legal team, said she hoped Poland would face consequences for deporting a person who was at “significant risk of torture” in his homeland. “Other nations should know that they cannot deport people who have fled Russia back to Russia at the current time,” she said. Polish authorities, in a statement released on Wednesday afternoon, said they had carefully studied Navruzbekov’s case and found his story not to be credible. “Polish secret services assessed Navruzbekov as a person whose intentions and testimonies are unreliable and raise real doubts about the reason for his presence in Poland,” said the statement. “The biographical data provided by him, his described professional path and the information he gave about Russia’s activities … turned out to be inconsistent, in many places also untrue or unverifiable,” it continued. Osechkin, reached by telephone on Tuesday, said Navruzbekov’s story was “complicated and difficult” and said he understood why Polish authorities had become suspicious of the Russian. Moskalenko said she could not comment on the nature of the Polish allegations, but accused authorities there of a “crude violation of human rights” for deporting Navruzbekov before the appeal process had been exhausted. “Suddenly, in a huge rush they pulled him out of the facility where he was being held waiting for the decision on his appeal. The appeal had not been heard yet, so you cannot call the deportation decision a final decision,” she said. Navruzbekov’s wife, Irada Navruzbekova, said on Wednesday that she understood her husband was now in Kaliningrad and facing an immediate court case, though she had no information about what charges he faced or whether he had a lawyer. “I don’t know what to do, and I don’t know what they will do with him. I really hope he stays alive; that my children will still have a father,” she said in a telephone interview. The couple have two children including a two-month-old baby, she said. Poland granted asylum protection to her and the two children on the same day her husband was deported.","Id":"world/2023/jun/08/poland-deports-russian-asylum-seeker-who-claimed-to-have-fled-fsb","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Poland deports Russian man who claimed to have been FSB officer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/poland-deports-russian-asylum-seeker-who-claimed-to-have-fled-fsb","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/08/poland-deports-russian-asylum-seeker-who-claimed-to-have-fled-fsb","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":758,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T07:05:48Z","id":"world/2023/jun/08/poland-deports-russian-asylum-seeker-who-claimed-to-have-fled-fsb","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Taking the emotion out of decisions is the way forward at a football club","body":"When we became the major shareholders at Grimsby Town in 2021 we chatted to the manager, Paul Hurst, and set out two commitments that we continue to stand by. The first was that, as owners, we would never go into the changing room. This is a surprisingly common occurrence, as demonstrated by Todd Boehly at Chelsea. For us, this is about setting clear expectations and boundaries of trust and we limit our visits to the training ground for the same reason. These spaces are for the manager and players and they should know that. Owners, while setting the tone, should trust the people they hire to run the club, in our case the manager and CEO. The second commitment was that after a game the manager has no obligation to see or speak to us. After a busy day we want the manager to be able to get home and see his family but, just as importantly, we feel that no good decisions about anything will be made immediately after a match. Put more elaborately, we want to take the emotion of match days out of our decision-making process. In this I have been influenced by Daniel Kahneman, the renowned psychologist and Nobel laureate who wrote the brilliant book Thinking, Fast and Slow where he introduces the concept of System 1 and System 2 thinking. These are distinct cognitive processes that shape human decision-making and judgment and this analogy is particularly useful in relation to sport. Related: For Saudi Arabia, rush of star football signings could be its most effective tool | Will Unwin System 1 thinking, often referred to as intuitive or automatic thinking, is fast, effortless and operates largely on unconscious processing. It relies on heuristics: mental shortcuts that allow for quick assessments and immediate responses to stimuli. It enables us to make snap judgments, recognise familiar faces and react swiftly to potential threats. Although vital in our evolutionary development, it is prone to biases and can lead to errors when faced with unfamiliar or complex situations. System 2 thinking is deliberative and analytical. It involves conscious effort, concentration and logical reasoning. System 2 thinking requires mental resources and is characterised by slower, more deliberate decision-making. It is essential for tasks that require attention to detail, complex calculations and critical thinking. These two systems work together and understanding the interplay seems crucial for comprehending how our minds work. Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from rationality or logical reasoning in human decision-making. In football, there are many opportunities for these biases and being conscious of their possibility can be useful. Some of the main biases I have noticed in football are outcome bias, confirmation bias, availability bias and loss aversion. Outcome bias involves evaluating the quality of a decision based on its outcome rather than the decision-making process itself. In football, fans often judge success or failure based solely on the final score of a game, without considering the complexities and uncertainties inherent in the sport. Although results are clearly the most important factor, underlying data on performance needs to be brought into the conversation to make a balanced judgment. We experienced this in the 2021-22 season when we had one win in 11 games and people called for us to change the manager. The data told us a different story about underlying performance and eventually we were promoted. It is worth remembering that the team who “deserve” to win (defined as a team that outperform the opposition on xG by a reasonable margin) win only 64% of the time. Plymouth won the League One title despite their top scorer scoring only 13 goals. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA Confirmation bias occurs when people seek or interpret information in a way that confirms their preexisting beliefs. Good examples from football abound when fans use individual events to “prove” their own (usually negative) thesis about a club or player, or the constant discussion about the requirement of a “20-goal-a-season striker” as the only way to be successful. Plymouth won League One this season with their top scorer Ryan Hardie on 13 goals and Leyton Orient won League Two with no player scoring more than 10, but people who hold this belief will find it hard to shake. This can be further understood as availability bias, which occurs when we overestimate the importance or likelihood of events based on how easily examples or instances come to mind. As football is such a low-scoring game, goals are easier to recollect than tackles made or defensive lines held. This often leads to a lack of appreciation of the art of defending or the collective effort of a team. Another classic is “2-0 is a dangerous lead”, which is pointed out whenever a team give up a two-goal lead. But the reality is they’re given up only about 10% of the time. One of the most provocative biases in relation to football is loss aversion, the tendency to give more psychological weight to potential losses than potential gains. In non-sporting scenarios an example that often occurs is with financial investments, when individuals may be hesitant to sell an asset performing poorly because they are averse to realising a loss. They may hold on to the investment in the hope that the situation will improve, even if it is more rational to cut their losses and redirect their resources to more promising opportunities. In football, this bias often shows up when a team have taken a lead. There is a natural inclination for some coaches and players to become more cautious, focusing on maintaining their lead rather than actively seeking to extend it. This defensive mindset can intuitively feel right but data suggests that often maintaining possession, building attacks and creating scoring opportunities can help not only in increasing the goal margin but also in controlling the game and reducing the chances of the opposition mounting a comeback. There are hundreds of biases and examples of where they show up in life and sport. Our thinking is naturally flawed because it is part of being human. Football will be played predominantly with System 1 and training prepares players for this reality. Strategic decisions should be the domain of System 2. It should be the output of a process of slowing down, assessing options, seeking comparables and taking the chance to seek diverse opinions and data before setting the long-distance course and destination. This close-season gives us that opportunity at Grimsby. Two years into our three-year plan we are working with Twenty First Group (which has provided some data points here) and our new adviser Gareth Jennings to write a 10-year plan. Like all strategies, it sets you on a journey but has to respond to reality and be adaptive to survive. There are always iterations based on new information but the ability to stay on a defined course is one way to ensure better decisions are mostly being made.

On one level, it is a love story, or rather a story about the loss of love. It begins with a woman, Katharina, hearing about the death of her former lover. Boxes of his papers are delivered to her apartment, and when she finally sits down to open them the past rises before her like a pack of playing cards thrown into the air. The book then moves back to their first meeting, tracing step by step the contours of a relationship that is not only intellectually and emotionally complicated in itself, but whose difficulties are compounded through its relationship to the collapse of East Germany. Katharina and Hans meet in East Berlin in 1986, and they live out the disintegration of all their hopes and dreams, personally and politically, throughout the course of the novel. Although Kairos is focused on a romantic relationship, it is not really romantic; disillusion seems baked in from the start. When the couple meet, Katharina is 19 years old, with her life ahead of her. Hans is married with a son, an apparently successful writer and broadcaster, and 34 years her senior. The two are clearly convinced that they have found a great love, but Hans seems more like a teacher than a lover to Katharina The two are clearly convinced that they have found a great love, but from the very beginning Hans seems more like a teacher than a lover to Katharina. As time goes on he becomes violent, punishes her severely for a brief betrayal and tries to re-educate her into submission. The dark nature of their relationship finds expression in Erpenbeck’s characteristically unyielding style. The novel is written in the present tense, a technique that can be flattening when used by lesser writers. In an elegant translation by Michael Hofmann, here it creates a claustrophobic intensity. Erpenbeck’s ability to make you enter so completely into the obsessive nature of the lovers’ experience is disconcerting, and as Hans becomes more and more cruel, it is increasingly uncomfortable. As Katharina is ground down by him, the reader suffers along with her, page by page, longing for her freedom. Anyone who has read Erpenbeck’s previous work will know that she is not committed only to personal stories. She grew up in East Germany, and her novels are always the stories of Germany, its politics and history, as much as they are about their protagonists’ private lives. In Go, Went, Gone, published in English in 2017, she dramatised the experiences of refugees newly arrived in Germany alongside the tale of a retired professor whose own sense of home had been rocked by the fall of the Berlin Wall. In The End of Days, published in English in 2014, she gave her protagonist a number of different lives, buffeted by political cross-currents towards different deaths. Kairos is the apotheosis of this endeavour to fuse the personal and the political, as our two lovers experience and sometimes seem to embody the political reality of East Germany at the end of the communist dream. The relationship finds wider echoes in that country’s lost ideals and its insistence on holding on to the past long after its inhabitants know they must move on. Take the moment when Hans, while working on a book about his country, discovers a note in which Katharina has written down evidence of her infidelity. “In February 1956 Khrushchev speaks for the first time about Stalin’s crimes. In March 1956 Brecht falls ill, in August he dies. The Stalinallee in Berlin is renamed Karl-Marx-Allee. Someone picks up the disdained name and throws it over a low wall into the adjoining yard … There are three weeks between the night Katharina spent in the studio and the day where she hurries out to buy some cake, while Hans is ferreting about for an empty bit of scrap paper … He finds one, but it has some writing on it.” So Hans is reliving the way the Soviet Union could not cover up its lies at the moment he uncovers Katharina’s lies, and remembering Brecht’s despair just as he is about to despair over Katharina’s betrayal. Yet there are no exact parallels here, and the gaps that emerge between the personal and the political feel just as important as the closeness. Once the Berlin Wall falls, the relationship begins to change, and the inertia that had held the lovers in one another’s orbit for so long loosens. Gradually, Katharina moves on, but that is not to say the book has a happy ending. As western values prevail, “the freedom to consume seems like an india rubber wall to her, separating people from any yearnings that might transcend their personal and momentary wishes. Is she about to be another customer?” This suggestion that even outside such a destructive relationship, there is no emotional fulfilment available in our depleted world is a deeply troubling one. Katharina’s final discoveries about the past reveal yet more unanswered questions about her relationship and her times. Throughout these personal and political journeys, Erpenbeck never reaches for the stock phrase or the known response. While the novel is indeed bleak in its view of love and politics, spending time with Erpenbeck’s rigorous and uncompromising imagination is invigorating all the way to the final page. • Natasha Walter’s next book, Before the Light Fades: A Memoir of Grief and Resistance, will be published in August by Virago.

The report from the Inspector of Custodial Services, Eamon Ryan, was released on Thursday, but was provided to the Western Australia parliament on 8 May, one day before to the most recent riot at the detention centre. Inspections were carried out in early February 2023. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The riot at the juvenile facility for offenders aged 10-17 years, lasted two days as dozens of the approximately 90 youths detained at the facility allegedly burned buildings, threatened staff and attempted to escape. The safety of the detention centre has long been criticised, with Western Australia’s Aboriginal Legal Service (ALSWA) labelling the treatment of children in the facility as “child abuse”. Ryan’s team included specialist advisers on education, health, mental health and cultural safety, and found the centre to be in a state of emergency. Related: Breaking the cycle: protesters demand solutions for youth detainees of Banksia Hill “Every element of Banksia Hill was failing, often through no fault of its own or the efforts of staff,” he said. “Ultimately, we saw young people, staff and a physical environment in acute crisis.” Ryan said there were site-wide confinement orders in place at the centre for every day of the 10-day inspection, meaning young people were locked in cells “for excessive lengths of time in order to maintain the good government, good order and security of the centre” which he said was due to a lack of sufficient staffing. He said the daily staff shortages were unprecedented, the staff attrition unsustainable and recruitment was not able to keep pace. He said keeping young people locked in cells causes a self-perpetuating cycle at the centre, with the isolation increasing anxieties, anger and frustration, which can sometimes lead to acting out negatively. “The help these young people need and the effective rehabilitation they require are exactly the types of interventions (education, programs, recreation, training, family reconnection and general health and mental health) that have been most heavily impacted by staffing shortages and increased lockdowns,” he said. The report quotes youth saying that being kept in cells for long periods of time made them feel suicidal, depressed and alone. During the 10 days of inspection, there were less than 30 custodial staff available for each day shift, and the weekend before the inspection, the centre ran with just 15 officers on one day, and 16 the next. Rat faeces in an office at the detention centre. The custodial report found piles of dirty laundry and rubbish and a rat infestation. Photograph: Office of the Inspector of Custodial Services On that weekend, the lack of staff meant young people from the good behaviour unit were employed to serve meals to others in the centre. The report notes the current staff-to-young-people ratio at 1:8 is “unsafe”. The inspection also found the centre in a general state of disrepair, with food left to rot in cells, piles of dirty laundry and rubbish and a rat infestation with “tens of rats” observed after a lockdown one evening. Ryan said the riots on 9 and 10 May were an “enormous setback” for the centre, and the situation will need to be monitored in the weeks and months to come. Ryan’s findings echo the comments of relatives of those detained in the centre. Lee-Anne Mason told Guardian Australia in May that she was alarmed at the treatment of Indigenous youth at the centre. Among the 10 recommendations in the report, Ryan called for the WA government to commit to a second youth detention facility, stating Banksia Hill does not work, and the use of Casuarina prison’s Unit 18 where young people are sometimes kept, demonstrates the “need for a smaller facility for those with complex behavioural needs”. The other recommendations include improving recruitment, staff retention, and urgently recruiting Indigenous-related positions, setting tight timeframes for hearings for those being detained in the centre, and setting up more support roles. The WA department of justice accepted most recommendations, but said a decision on a new facility was a matter for government, and rejected a recommendation for an alternative location for a crisis support centre, noting it would require a significant redesign of the facility. The department acknowledged staffing issues had caused difficulties. “The complex behaviours of some young people have resulted in staff assaults and contributed to increased workers compensation and personal leave,” the department said. “The current national labour market and media reports of incidents have made attraction and retention of staff even more difficult.

Harry isn’t the only person chasing the hacking scandal all the way to court: he’s one of four claimants in this trial, along with ex and current Corrie actors Nikki Sanderson and Michael Le Vell, and Fiona Wightman, Paul Whitehouse’s ex-wife. In 2015, a judge ruled in favour of Paul Gascoigne and seven others, awarding £1.2m in compensation. Yet the prince is an object lesson in why people so rarely choose to go to war against the press: it’s like playing a game of football in which the other team is also both referee and commentator. They can make up the rules as they go along, and even after you’ve lost, the game will never, ever end. Harry’s overall charge is that MGN, whether by phone hacking, obtaining information by deception, or employing private investigators who used illegal methods, has been trashing his reputation since before he could read newspapers (some poetic licence there, as I have no idea when he learned to read; but thanks to the tabloids’ narrative, in which he’s portrayed as – in his words – a “thicko” and a “drug taker”, I’m guessing about 17?). His day in court came and it went; it will be adjudicated in due course, and then it will be over; but I think it doubtful that the tabloids will ever, whether in concert or one at a time, stop trashing his reputation. He tried to put this fire out with petrol. Yet the other problem is correctly identified by the Mail: court is not the place to go with a moral case, and it’s not the right precinct for dealing with feelings, however profound and justified they are. In its literal-minded way, it requires a law to have demonstrably been broken. The exchange I found most telling was this one, with Andrew Green KC, acting for MGN: “Do you think the absence of call data suggests you were not hacked by any MGN journalist?” Green asked. “Absolutely not,” Harry said. “If the court finds that you were not hacked by MGN would you be relieved or disappointed?” He replied that since hacking was everywhere, he’d “feel some injustice” if his claim wasn’t accepted. He says, but can’t prove, that journalists were all using burner phones, and that’s why there are no records; he says information could only have come from his phone, but of course can’t prove the absence of “royal sources” or friends of girlfriends that MGN says were in fact providing its intel; he needs a case specific to the Mirror, since you can’t put “tabloid culture” in the dock, and yet on multiple occasions, the publisher was able to show that his personal information was already in the public domain. It may have arrived there through other papers’ hacking, but that would just be a piquant detail and would do nothing to strengthen Harry’s case. He’s not wrong to “feel some injustice” – without question, this country’s media culture, and its labile relationship with the royals, craven one minute, insatiable and crowing the next, has changed his life. Few characters could have withstood seeing every failed relationship, every misadventure, immediately in the spotlight. I don’t have any real doubt that racist dog-whistling, in some sections of the media, made his life in the UK untenable after his marriage. And that’s all to put aside the death of his mother, for which he holds press intrusion squarely responsible. But because it’s a culture, rather than a single news organisation, firing-squad rules apply: it is exceedingly difficult to pinpoint the individual gun, let alone find it still smoking. All he’s really been able to show are the exit wounds. Which makes me wonder whether that wasn’t the point all along, whether he came to court because, win or lose, the sheer impact of a royal in the witness box would make the statement that previous attempts – the Netflix documentary, the memoir – have only partially landed: that they may be royal, but they’re still human, and it’s wrong to treat them like zoo animals. I don’t know if that statement will ever land, or whether the value proposition of royalty evaporates once you start insisting on the ordinary flesh and blood of which it is composed.

Britain placed 28th out of 30 countries for the proportion of people agreeing that teenagers with parental consent should be able to access “gender-affirming” care. Only Hungary, which banned transgender people from legally changing their gender in 2020, and the US recorded lower levels of support than Britain’s 47%. Britain was also in the bottom half of the countries polled on the question of whether transgender people should be protected from discrimination in employment, housing and access to restaurants and shops, with almost one in four saying they disagreed with protections or were not sure. Only 40% of people in Britain believe transgender people should be allowed to use single-sex facilities such as public toilets that correspond to the gender they identify with, compared with 55% across the 30-country average, 70% in Italy, 65% in Spain and the Netherlands and 79% in Thailand, which was consistently the most pro-transgender nation in the Ipsos survey. It found nearly two in three people in Britain believe transgender people face a great deal or fair amount of discrimination. Interactive The figures, gathered between February and March this year, follow a high-profile controversy over the NHS Gender Identity Development Service at the Tavistock and Portman NHS foundation trust in London, which offered therapy and hormone blockers for children. Inspections found it “inadequate” and it is due to close next year. An independent review of the service by the paediatrician Dr Hilary Cass highlighted the lack of agreement “and in many instances a lack of open discussion” on the nature of “gender incongruence” in young people, and whether it was “an inherent and immutable phenomenon for which transition is the best option for the individual, or a more fluid and temporal response to a range of developmental, social, and psychological factors.” Interactive The 2021 census of England and Wales found 262,000 people identified as a gender different to their sex registered at birth – 0.5% of the population that responded. Responding to the polling, the LGBT+ anti-abuse charity Galop said hostility towards trans and non-binary people in the UK was growing. “We have trans, non-binary and gender non-conforming people in our services who are deliberately dehydrating themselves to avoid using public toilets for fear of attack or harassment, as well as seeing butch cis women experiencing higher levels of hostility in single-sex public spaces,” said Leni Morris, the chief executive. “In the last six months, our services have seen a 74% increase in trans and non-binary people seeking support after experiencing transphobic hate crimes compared with the previous six months.” Interactive An Ipsos spokesperson said: “Britons’ support for gender-affirming measures is mixed and falls in the bottom six of the 30 countries surveyed across a range of measures. Among the 30 countries covered, support for various pro-transgender measures is consistently high in Thailand, Italy, Spain and throughout Latin America; it tends to be lowest in South Korea, throughout eastern Europe, in Great Britain and in the United States, where transgender rights and protections have become polarising political issues.” The LGBT Foundation, a charity, said: “Support for gender-affirming measures, which are transformative and life-saving, is at alarmingly low levels.” It noted that the polling also showed a small reduction in support for same-sex marriage since 2021, although it was still a majority. “This seems to indicate a situation where the public is largely supportive of our communities but not always supportive of the measures that bring us equality,” it said.","Id":"society/2023/jun/08/less-than-half-in-britain-back-gender-affirming-care-for-trans-teenagers","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Less than half in Britain back gender-affirming care for trans teenagers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/08/less-than-half-in-britain-back-gender-affirming-care-for-trans-teenagers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/jun/08/less-than-half-in-britain-back-gender-affirming-care-for-trans-teenagers","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":593,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T06:00:01Z","id":"society/2023/jun/08/less-than-half-in-britain-back-gender-affirming-care-for-trans-teenagers","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"‘No regrets,’ says Edward Snowden, after 10 years in exile","body":"Edward Snowden has warned that surveillance technology is so much more advanced and intrusive today it makes that used by US and British intelligence agencies he revealed in 2013 look like child’s play. In an interview on the 10th anniversary of his revelations about the scale of surveillance – some of it illegal – by the US National Security Agency and its British counterpart, GCHQ, he said he had no regrets about what he had done and cited positive changes. But he is depressed about inroads into privacy both in the physical and digital world. “Technology has grown to be enormously influential,” Snowden said. “If we think about what we saw in 2013 and the capabilities of governments today, 2013 seems like child’s play.” He expressed concern not only about dangers posed by governments and Big Tech but commercially available video surveillance cameras, facial recognition, artificial intelligence and intrusive spyware such as Pegasus used against dissidents and journalists. Looking back to 2013, he said: “We trusted the government not to screw us. But they did. We trusted the tech companies not to take advantage of us. But they did. That is going to happen again, because that is the nature of power.” Snowden has been in exile in Russia since 2013 after fleeing Hong Kong, where he handed over tens of thousands of top-secret documents to journalists. His detractors denounce him for being in Russia, though it appears to be the only realistic option available to him other than jail in the US. Criticism has intensified since the invasion of Ukraine and his acquisition of Russian citizenship last year, two years after he applied. But despite his personal predicament, Snowden does not dwell on the past. “I have no regrets,” he said. Related: Snowden, MI5 and me: how the leak of the century came to be published Snowden has reduced his public profile over the last two years, giving fewer speeches, and retreating from press interviews and social media. This is partly because of family commitments: he and his wife have two young sons. But he has remained in contact over the last decade with the three journalists who met him in Hong Kong, including this reporter. Friday marks exactly 10 years since Snowden revealed himself as the source of the leaks. Snowden views the widespread use of end-to-end encryption as one of the positive legacies of the leaks. The Big Tech companies had been embarrassed by revelations the NSA had been handing over personal data. That embarrassment turned to anger when further leaks revealed that, in spite of that cooperation, the NSA had been helping themselves to data from the Big Tech companies through backdoor vulnerabilities. In response, in spite of opposition from the agencies, companies rushed in end-to-end encryption years earlier than planned. End-to-end encryption “was a pipe dream in 2013 when the story broke”, Snowden said. “An enormous fraction of global internet traffic traveled electronically naked. Now, it is a rare sight.” Related: What’s really changed 10 years after the Snowden revelations? But Snowden is worried by technological advances that eat into privacy. “The idea that after the revelations in 2013 there would be rainbows and unicorns the next day is not realistic. It is an ongoing process. And we will have to be working at it for the rest of our lives and our children’s lives and beyond.” The intelligence agencies in the US and the UK acknowledge there was benefit from the debate on privacy that Snowden provoked but still argue this is outweighed by the damage they claim was done to their capabilities, including MI6 having to close down human-intelligence operations. Their other complaint is that the narrative in 2013 portrayed the NSA and GCHQ as the sole malign actors, ignoring what Russia and China were doing on the internet. Snowden disputes such claims. He said no one at the time thought Russia and China were angels. As for damage, he said the agencies have never cited any evidence. “Disruption? Sure, that is plausible,” he said. “But it is hard to claim ‘damage’ if, despite 10 years of hysterics, the sky never fell in.”","Id":"us-news/2023/jun/08/no-regrets-says-edward-snowden-after-10-years-in-exile","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"‘No regrets,’ says Edward Snowden, after 10 years in exile","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/08/no-regrets-says-edward-snowden-after-10-years-in-exile","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/jun/08/no-regrets-says-edward-snowden-after-10-years-in-exile","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":664,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T06:00:01Z","id":"us-news/2023/jun/08/no-regrets-says-edward-snowden-after-10-years-in-exile","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Must we hate Noel Gallagher’s version of Love Will Tear Us Apart? I’m loving it","body":"When it comes to cover versions, there seems to be an unspoken rule: be careful if the artist is dead. Sure, some covers surpass their originals, such as Nothing Compares 2 U by Sinéad O’Connor (originally by Prince) and I Will Always Love You by Whitney Houston (Dolly Parton). But is that true of, say, Nirvana? This makes Noel Gallagher’s reinterpretation of Joy Division’s Love Will Tear Us Apart – performed so far on BBC Radio 2 and on his US tour, which started last week – particularly alarming. The main problem is that it is not as good as the original. Gallagher has previous form on this, with his cover of There Is a Light That Never Goes Out by the Smiths. And he knows the risks. Speaking of the Joy Division cover on Radio 2, he said: “I was like: ‘Can we get away with that?’ Because it’s such an iconic song – and being from Manchester as well … this is going to be tricky.” Unsurprisingly, this latest offering has divided audiences. His brother, Liam, came down clearly on one side, writing on Twitter: “I must once again apologise on behalf of my family for Rkids piss poor and damn rite blasphemous version of joy division’s love will tear us apart tut fucking tut SORRY.” But is it really that bad? No. The problem is that it doesn’t sound like Noel Gallagher. It also doesn’t sound much like Love Will Tear Us Apart. It lacks the bass line, which is the best bit. Or does it? If you listen closely, you’ll hear the backing musicians playing it subtly, while Gallagher’s take on Ian Curtis’s vocals pushes him out of his comfort zone, which is striking. Plus, he dedicated the song to my cousin when he played it in Ridgefield, Washington. So, after hating it at first, I now love it. Who’s next, I wonder?

Two days after the destruction of Ukraine’s Nova Kakhovka dam led to widespread flooding, it’s clear that we are only beginning to appreciate the impact of what happened – and what it could mean for the environment, local agriculture and the course of the war. At the heart of this story, however, are the people who live downstream on the Dnipro river, who have already endured months on the frontline and now find themselves living through a personal and environmental calamity. The Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh is in Kherson, the biggest city to be affected; he spoke to me about the scene on the ground and its wider implications. First, the headlines. Five big stories UK news | Boris and Carrie Johnson hosted a close friend overnight at Chequers when a number of Covid restrictions were in place, the Guardian has been told. Johnson’s spokesperson said the stay was “entirely lawful” and sources close to him said Maloney was allowed to be there for childcare reasons at a time when Carrie Johnson was pregnant. Immigration | A Guardian investigation has found that the Home Office has provided more than £3m in funding to Turkish border forces in the last year to prevent migrants reaching the UK. The Home Office has also supplied Turkish border forces, including the national police and the coastguard, with equipment and training. Environment | The United Arab Emirates’s state oil company has been able to read emails to and from the Cop28 climate summit office, the Guardian revealed. The UAE is hosting the climate summit in November and its president, Sultan Al Jaber, is also chief executive of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. The revelations have been called “explosive” and a “scandal” by lawmakers.

In depth: ‘We don’t know what the new landscape will look like’ Police evacuate local residents from a flooded area after the Nova Kakhovka dam breached, in Kherson. Photograph: Reuters Hundreds of thousands are without drinking water, according to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. As many as 80 towns and villages and about 42,000 people are at risk. Landmines have been dislodged and are floating to unknown locations downstream, according to the Red Cross. Meanwhile the first reports of casualties have emerged, with at least three dead. The destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam is not confirmed to be Russia’s doing, although Zelenskiy has said he “does not understand” how anyone could doubt it, and some international observers agree (Moscow, for its part, blames Ukrainian “sabotage”). But there is no question its impact has been enormous. “This is a huge crisis,” said Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian’s defence and security editor, who has been reporting from Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict, adding that there is “something elemental” about the scale of the flooding. “It’s just a massive river. We don’t know where the river boundary will end up. We don’t know what the new landscape will look like.” *** How are people coping? The water was still rising, though more slowly than before, when Dan spoke to me yesterday from central Kherson. He was standing at a crossroads that ordinarily would be hundreds of metres from the riverbank; instead, he said, the kerb had become “quite a busy little port” as rescue boats came and went. For eight months last year, Kherson was occupied by Russian forces; parts of it have been heavily damaged by shelling and many people had already left the city by the time the floods hit. “Younger people tend to get out as fast as they can,” said Dan. “The residents who have stayed on are mostly older, and have point blank refused to go.” For many of those who remained, though, the flooding has forced them out of the homes they resolutely refused to quit. As we spoke, Dan described an inflatable dinghy arriving, carrying a woman in her 70s and an older man who was unable to walk, who had been rescued along with “the obligatory dog”. A basket of five brown cats had been brought in a little earlier; in the background a dog was barking. “There are a lot of abandoned pets – you see them everywhere. It’s just a feature of a war zone.” *** What about the wider impacts? A man looks on at a flooded area in Kherson, Ukraine, 7 June 2023. Photograph: Mykola Tymchenko/EPA Alongside the thousands of homes and lives casually ruined, there are warnings of large scale consequences elsewhere in the region. Zelenskiy called the flooding “an environmental bomb of mass destruction”, and Kyiv has said this is Europe’s biggest ecological catastrophe since Chornobyl (also in Ukraine) in 1986. As well as the impact on wildlife, the country’s agriculture ministry has warned that the fields of southern Ukraine could “turn into deserts” by next year, as their irrigation relied on the now-drained reservoir. The collapse of Ukrainian agriculture could also have a significant impact on the global food market. *** What happens next? “The flood water is muddy, it’s full of detritus and organic material, it’s got some of that iridescent sheen of oil on it,” said Dan. “It’s going through sewage facilities, cemeteries. It is fundamentally unclean. You know that it is going to be a smelly, grubby, disgusting mess when it comes to cleaning up.” Overall, he said, “the legacy of this will be with us for a long time. At this stage, we’ve moved past the initial shock into the practical phase, and only later we will see all of the impacts and the environmental changes. We’re right at the beginning of this.” Despite the scale of the floods, however, Dan said we should not underestimate the resilience of the Ukrainian people. Two women in their 50s or 60s, who were watching the rescue efforts, told him they would not leave their apartments, though the ground floor of their block was already inundated. “I have seen this many times. The determination and resilience of people here is extraordinary. Those women have no intention of moving. And in one sense, I am confident that people will get through this.” What else we’ve been reading Sky News’s Prince Harry lookalike.

The pair poured their own earnings into their project, adapting a motorbike into their now-distinctive bird ambulance. It all started with a chance encounter in 2018 on their daily commute to work where they saw a helpless bird entangled by its wing, dangling from a branch. After calling the local fire service, the bird was eventually rescued but they decided they wanted to do more. “Initially, it was just the two of us, but as word spread, people from all walks of life joined us,” says Amit.

The court on Thursday began hearing a key case about a legal tactic now routinely being employed by the church and other institutions to permanently shield themselves from abuse survivors’ civil claims for compensation. Institutions are now regularly seeking permanent stays, or a permanent halt to proceedings, by arguing the death of alleged perpetrators and the inability to obtain their response to a survivor’s allegations leaves them unable to receive a fair trial. The approach has infuriated survivors and their advocates, who say the church is now effectively using the passage of time to avoid trial, despite the fact the church systemically and deliberately concealed abuse for decades in dioceses across Australia. Related: ‘It’s gutless’: clergy abuse survivors and their families outraged by legal stays that thwart cases Critics argue the approach is also at odds with the findings of the royal commission about the vast barriers that survivors face in coming forwards, which delay their complaints by an average of 22 years. The high court is considering the New South Wales court of appeal’s decision to grant the Lismore diocese a permanent stay in one case, brought by GLJ, a woman who alleges she was abused as a 14-year-old by Lismore priest Father Clarence Anderson. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The church argues that Anderson’s death in 1996, well before GLJ’s complaint, denied it the opportunity to seek a response from him and leaves it unable to properly contradict or challenge GLJ’s account. It says it has been left “utterly in the dark” over whether the abuse occurred. But the high court heard that the church had held evidence about his abuse of other children from 1971, the year of his defrocking. Justice Jayne Jagot asked counsel for the church, Bret Walker SC, why it did not have an adequate opportunity between 1971 and Anderson’s death in 1996 to make broader inquiries with the former priest and other church officials about the extent of his abuse. “From 1971, there are red flags everywhere about this person,” Jagot said. Walker said that such inquiries would only have uncovered anything about GLJ or her alleged abuse by chance. “It would have been happenstance only by which that inquiry would have raised anything about the appellant,” he said. Permanent stays are typically reserved for extraordinary or exceptional situations in which a fair trial is not possible. Related: NSW lawyers call for reform of ‘disgraceful’ tactic churches use to block abuse claims But GLJ’s counsel, Perry Herzfeld SC, and solicitors, Ken Cush and Associates, argue that the long passage of time in abuse cases such as GLJ’s makes the degradation of evidence and deaths of perpetrators common. Herzfeld said there needed to be a greater tolerance for the loss of evidentiary records in such cases. Otherwise, he said, permanent stays would become “routine”, rather than exceptional. “The inevitability of the long passage of time and the inevitability of the impoverishment of the evidentiary record means that one has to approach these applications with a greater tolerance for that,” he said. He also argued that, in GLJ’s case, the church held a wealth of evidence about Anderson’s abuse of other children, including statements from four other survivors – the material which allowed for a fair trial to take place. Herzfeld said there was no need for Anderson to be alive for the church to challenge GLJ’s account through cross-examination. “If defendants decide to contest a plaintiff’s account ... they don’t need a contrary witness in order to have a proper basis to do so,” he said. The hearing continues before the high court.","Id":"australia-news/2023/jun/08/red-flags-everywhere-high-court-asks-catholic-church-why-it-didnt-investigate-priests-abuse-50-years-ago","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"‘Red flags everywhere’: high court asks Catholic church why it didn’t investigate priest’s abuse 50 years ago ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/08/red-flags-everywhere-high-court-asks-catholic-church-why-it-didnt-investigate-priests-abuse-50-years-ago","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jun/08/red-flags-everywhere-high-court-asks-catholic-church-why-it-didnt-investigate-priests-abuse-50-years-ago","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":617,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T05:38:49Z","id":"australia-news/2023/jun/08/red-flags-everywhere-high-court-asks-catholic-church-why-it-didnt-investigate-priests-abuse-50-years-ago","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"TV tonight: Davina McCall gets her coil changed on camera in this brilliant documentary","body":"Davina McCall’s Pill Revolution 9pm, Channel 4 Kudos to any woman who is up for being filmed while getting her coil changed in the name of education.

With soft, seductive and reassuring voiceovers, a TV ad shows images of hospitals, farms and city lights with the tagline “Natural gas: keeping the country running.” Running the campaign is the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea), whose chief executive, Samantha McCulloch, said the idea was to raise the public’s awareness of the “critical role of gas”. Related: Australia’s ‘first carbon-neutral telco’: do Telstra’s environmental claims about Belong stack up? | Temperature Check On the campaign website, there are “facts” – lots of them – several of which are only partly true, cherrypicked or ignore the role of fossil gas in loading the atmosphere with methane and CO2 in the middle of a climate crisis that will only get worse with more fossil fuels. So let’s do what any self-respecting factcheck column would do and go and do some factchecking. Gas for electricity “As Australia shuts down coal, gas is picking up the load,” the gas industry says in the advert. “It will help keep Australia running as we transition to a cleaner future,” the ad claims. In a fact sheet, Appea says the “share of gas-fired power generation in Australia’s electricity mix more than doubled between 2000-01 and 2020-21”. The source for that statistic is the government’s Australian Energy Update 2022 report, and taken across two decades, the data agrees with Appea. But in the most recent decade, the same report says gas-fired generation has grown by just 0.2%. The report says: “Natural gas-fired generation in 2020–21 fell nationally to the lowest level in a decade, and in the southern and eastern states which constitute the National Electricity Market, fell to the lowest level seen since the early 2000s.” That is not a story of surging gas-fired power as the Appea campaign suggests, but a flatlining – and remember, too, that more than 80% of the gas produced in Australia is not consumed by Australians at all, but is used for the export of LNG. A main source? In Appea’s television advert, a voiceover says gas is “one of Australia’s main sources for generating electricity”. A fact sheet asks: “What makes that electricity powering Australian homes?” and then says “about a fifth of the electricity we use” comes from burning gas. Right now, about 18% of the electricity generated in Australia comes from gas, according to government statistics. But this figure is heavily skewed by Western Australia, which accounts for half of all gas-fired power generation despite having only 10% of the country’s population. Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, says in the National Electricity Market (covering 90% of the population, that is, everywhere except Western Australia and the Northern Territory) gas generation has fallen about 45% since 2014. In this current financial year so far, gas has been responsible for only 5.6% of electricity generation in the NEM – less than coal, wind, solar and hydro. So if you live anywhere but WA or the NT, then gas doesn’t account for “about a fifth” of the electricity you use, but more like “an eighteenth” – which isn’t quite as impressive. Mark Ogge, a principal adviser at The Australia Institute, says the amount of gas-fired electricity used by Australians in their homes is likely even less, because “gas industry uses around one-fifth of the electricity generated in Australia to run its LNG export terminals”. “So really, [Appea] is claiming electricity generation has increased largely because the gas industry is using more electricity to export Australia’s gas.” Future role for gas The Appea advert says gas “will help keep Australia running as we transition to a cleaner future”. The Australian Energy Market Operator’s main plan to decarbonise the NEM does say gas will have an important role as a standby in case of shortages in solar, wind, hydro power and battery storage. The plan says that by 2050, there will be about the same amount of gas-fired capacity then as there is now. But the word “capacity” should not be confused with how much gas will actually be used. Dr Dylan McConnell, an energy systems analyst at the University of New South Wakes, says the most recent forecast from AEMO says that by 2040, the actual amount of gas being used for power generation will be about one-third of what it was in 2015. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Gas is cleaner … than what? One of the central facts in Appea’s campaign is that gas is “50% cleaner” than coal (which, as McConnell says, would be great if we only needed to reduce emissions by 50%). Appea says the source for this fact is an International Energy Agency report on gas and a 2017 report on the future of the electricity market from former chief scientist Dr Alan Finkel. How is it possible that gas is replacing coal, when gas is declining? It’s a logical impossibility Tristan Edis Hare says more up-to-date data from the NEM shows gas has 61% of the emissions of coal for each unit of power generated, not 50%. But there are other issues here. Comparing the emissions of gas to coal is moot because Australia has very likely built its last coal-fired power plant. Those coal plants still running are being turned off. Tristan Edis, an energy analyst at Green Energy Markets, says it is renewables that are replacing coal, not gas. He said: “How is it possible that gas is replacing coal, when gas is declining? It’s a logical impossibility. The only thing that’s increasing is wind and solar generation.” So the most pertinent comparison to the emissions of gas should be to renewables. McConnell points to industry data used by Aemo for new gas-fired power that might come into the system, showing the cleanest plants would emit about 377kg of CO2 for every unit of power produced (not counting emissions from extraction, transportation and any leaks of methane along the way). That compares with essentially zero for renewables (again, not counting for energy used to make and transport the turbines or solar panels). Climate crisis protesters rally on the steps of Parliament House in Adelaide before marching to the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association conference in Adelaide on 18 May. Photograph: Matt Turner/AAP Indispensable gas? Appea’s campaign might leave the average viewer with the idea that gas is indispensable. The campaign has a laundry list of products and processes that currently use gas – everything from producing fabrics to powering hospitals and providing hot showers (many of which can be done without the need for burning fossil gas). In one fact sheet, the campaign uses a quote from Prof Michael Brear, director of the Melbourne Energy Institute, that says an “all technology hands on deck approach” will be needed for Australia to reach net zero, and this will include doubling the capacity of gas-fired electricity generation to support renewables. Related: A climate policy that actually cuts emissions? It’s the reality that fossil fuel bosses and News Corp commentators can’t see | Temperature Check The quote was taken from a media release about the results of a major effort to model a net zero future for Australia which includes all energy use in the country – not just for generating electricity. So what does that report say about gas? All five of the net zero scenarios show gas use declining in Australia. When it comes to energy exported, only one scenario shows a growth in gas exports. But that scenario assumes a domestic carbon capture and storage (CCS) industry will emerge, and will have the capacity to store 1100Mt of CO2 every year. Is that a lot? For context, that is more than 25 times the amount of CCS storage that is currently operational around the globe. Hare says: “Appea makes strong and hyperbolic claims as to the importance of gas for economic activities but does not at all discuss the potential for replacement of gas through efficiency and electrification. “All sectors have opportunities to replace gas, including those that are most carbon-intensive, through improved efficiency, changes in processes and electrification with renewable power.”","Id":"environment/2023/jun/08/do-the-fossil-fuel-industrys-claims-of-australias-gas-fired-future-stack-up","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webTitle":"Do the fossil fuel industry’s claims of Australia’s gas-fired future stack up? | Temperature Check","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/do-the-fossil-fuel-industrys-claims-of-australias-gas-fired-future-stack-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jun/08/do-the-fossil-fuel-industrys-claims-of-australias-gas-fired-future-stack-up","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":1293,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T05:13:47Z","id":"environment/2023/jun/08/do-the-fossil-fuel-industrys-claims-of-australias-gas-fired-future-stack-up","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Can the yes campaign overcome the cold political calculus of Australia’s voice referendum?","body":"The arc of campaigning for and against the Indigenous voice to parliament is bending towards back rooms and the hard calculus of politics. The provisional date, not yet announced, is 14 October. That gives the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and other leading political proponents a clear month without parliament sitting to blitz the country and rescue a proposal that polling indicates is in trouble. The date is not set in stone. A source in the parliamentary yes campaign says if things look bad, the vote can be pushed back into late November, early December. But that would require a rescheduling of the parliamentary calendar and would signal desperation in the yes camp. Leaving aside the merits of the voice and seeing it purely in campaign terms, both the yes and no teams hold distinct cards. Related: Vote Liberal? You should vote yes for an Indigenous voice to parliament | Kate Carnell The yes campaign seems to be better funded and has more corporate support. Its advertisements will reach saturation in the final weeks. It needs to bring the high-toned possibilities of constitutional change to the forefront of minds currently focused on a slowing economy and rising strain on personal budgets. Government advertising so far has been neutral in tone, tasteful and bland. It is not vote-shifting. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, conceded as much in a press conference on Wednesday when she urged citizens to “let the fingers do the walking” and do their own research. “There are some really good websites,” she suggested. The emotive pitches will come later and the yes campaign has the financial power to push them. But the no campaign has its own on-field advantages. A successful referendum needs the so called “double majority” – a majority in overall votes and a majority in a majority of states. In the 1999 republic referendum, the no vote triumphed on both counts, despite opinion polls consistently showing majority support for an Australian head of state. The closest state to a majority was Victoria on 49.84%, while the yes vote managed just 37% in Queensland. The latest Newspoll numbers on the voice are not that far off the failed vote for the republic. But the opponents of the voice do not have to emulate the 1999 referendum numbers to win. There are six states. The yes vote needs a majority – four. The no campaign only needs three to carry the day, even if the national vote goes against them. The yes campaign remains officially confident. But it must win in more places. It must first secure that overall majority. That requires hard – and expensive – campaigning in the states where most people live: New South Wales and Victoria. The no campaign can cede that ground and save its money. It can run, effectively, as a political insurgency, focused entirely on three of the four remaining states. Senior figures in the yes campaign already concede privately that Queensland will be a hard sell. If yes is defeated there, the no campaign only needs two of the three remaining states: Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia. Tasmania is intriguing. The historical destruction of its first people is felt acutely. In Bridget Archer, the yes campaign has a prominent, articulate Liberal on side. Even more importantly, premier Jeremy Rockliff, the only Liberal premier in the nation, publicly supports the change. The partisanship seen on the mainland is more muted south of the strait. Related: A majority of First Nations people support the voice. Why don’t non-Indigenous Australians believe this? | Rebecca Huntley If Tasmania breaks yes, the pressure is on for South Australia and Western Australia. A yes campaigner notes conservative views have not gone down well recently in the west. Labor’s dominance under now departed premier, Mark McGowan, was absolute. That may drift now that he’s gone, but no one is taking the state for granted. 80% of the WA’s population lives in suburban Perth. Come spring, expect a frenzy of advertising targeting those suburbs because both sides need the state. If yes gets it, the game is all but won. But if the no campaign gains the west, South Australia becomes critical. Again, the no campaign will be outspent but can limit the disadvantages of its lack of corporate backers with careful targeting of its message. The yes campaign sells an inspiring and hopeful message: a nation stronger as one through recognition and more effective listening to our First Nations people. The no campaign has many targets, claiming a nation that will be more divided, more bureaucratic, less equal. As all old-time political campaigners will tell you: negative campaigning works. Doubt – or its energised cousin, fear – always starts from 10 metres ahead. • Hugh Riminton is national affairs editor at 10 News First","Id":"commentisfree/2023/jun/08/can-the-yes-campaign-overcome-the-cold-political-calculus-of-australias-voice-referendum","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webTitle":"Can the yes campaign overcome the cold political calculus of Australia’s voice referendum? | Hugh Riminton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/08/can-the-yes-campaign-overcome-the-cold-political-calculus-of-australias-voice-referendum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/08/can-the-yes-campaign-overcome-the-cold-political-calculus-of-australias-voice-referendum","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion","wordcount":759,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T05:03:45Z","id":"commentisfree/2023/jun/08/can-the-yes-campaign-overcome-the-cold-political-calculus-of-australias-voice-referendum","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Ukraine and Myanmar make 2022 most violent year in a decade for medical staff","body":"Russian attacks on medical facilities in Ukraine made 2022 the most violent year in a decade for hospitals and health workers operating in conflict zones, according to a new report by a coalition of humanitarian organisations. With 750 reported attacks in 2022, Russia set a 10-year record, according to the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition, which includes Human Rights Watch and the Johns Hopkins Center for Humanitarian Health. More than half of the 1,989 attacks on health facilities and workers reported globally took place in Ukraine and Myanmar. Under international law, attacking or interfering with medical services during an armed conflict is a war crime. “The scale of destruction in Ukraine is mind-boggling. There is not a day without a facility being impacted,” said Christina Wille, one of the report’s authors. “I’ve been looking at data [like this] for years, and I can hardly believe my eyes.” Some of the attacks appeared to target medical facilities deliberately, Wille said, while others were due to “indiscriminate” use of explosives in civilian areas. Ukrainian healthcare workers were also the most affected by killings and kidnappings, although those in Myanmar were the most impacted by arrests. Russia’s behaviour in Ukraine was not unique, said Wille, but it was distinguished by its scale and intensity. “For example, we’ve also seen very violent moments in the occupied Palestinian territories in 2021,” she said. “But that was 11 days, not over a year.” The remains of a hospital in Donetsk last December. The level of destruction of medical facilities in Ukraine was described as ‘mind-boggling’ by one of the report’s authors. Photograph: Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters “Contempt for law is contagious,” said Len Rubenstein, chair of the coalition and a professor at Johns Hopkins University. “When you see that someone can get away with attacking hospitals and healthcare, you’re encouraged to do it. “Russia faced no consequence for targeting hospitals in Syria, and now assaults on hundreds of Ukraine hospitals follow,” he said. As well as Ukraine, the report noted arrests and imprisonment of medical staff in retaliation for providing health services to dissidents. In Myanmar and Iran, 183 doctors were affected. “We have seen in Iran and Myanmar that when political demonstrations are violently crushed, medical staff providing healthcare to demonstrators are arrested,” Wille said. The global situation is not set to improve in 2023 as attacks in Ukraine are not subsiding and new conflicts appear. The war in Sudan started in April and has brought the country’s already struggling healthcare system to near collapse, with hospitals and clinics looted and bombed, and medics kidnapped. “I got rid of my medical ID when I was fleeing Khartoum,” said Mohamed Eisa, secretary general of the Sudanese American Physicians Association. “I was worried I might be kidnapped by the RSF [Rapid Support Forces], or even the army might take me hostage. They have been kidnapping doctors to treat their wounded.” “The effect of the conflict on Sudan’s healthcare system has been dire and extreme,” Eisa added. “60% of hospitals near the conflict area are not open at all. At least 19 healthcare workers have been killed. Physicians in Khartoum feel threatened.” Soba University hospital in southern Khartoum, this week. As shelling rocks the capital, only the dialysis department remains open; three-quarters of hospitals in combat zones are not functioning. Photograph: AFP/Getty Rubenstein said he hoped this year’s report would be a “turning point” that sparked greater political commitment and action. “Judicial mechanisms to hold perpetrators accountable exist,” he said. “Deliberate attacks against healthcare and indiscriminate attacks are war crimes.” However, there is little precedent for state actors facing legal consequences due to violating these laws, Rubenstein said. Only one case of an attack against a health facility has been successfully prosecuted under international law, when two former officers in the Serb armed forces were convicted in 2007 for their role in the Vukovar hospital massacre during the Croatian war of independence in 1991. Related: Medics in Sudan warn of crisis as health system near collapse “We hope our report will encourage the use of diplomatic leverage to exert pressure on perpetrators,” Rubenstein said. “In Ukraine, the international community got behind justice, so we think there will be interest in making sure that people finally pay the price for these kinds of crimes.”","Id":"global-development/2023/jun/08/ukraine-and-myanmar-make-2022-most-violent-year-in-a-decade-for-medical-staff","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webTitle":"Ukraine and Myanmar make 2022 most violent year in a decade for medical staff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jun/08/ukraine-and-myanmar-make-2022-most-violent-year-in-a-decade-for-medical-staff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2023/jun/08/ukraine-and-myanmar-make-2022-most-violent-year-in-a-decade-for-medical-staff","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":647,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T05:00:05Z","id":"global-development/2023/jun/08/ukraine-and-myanmar-make-2022-most-violent-year-in-a-decade-for-medical-staff","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Null Island: weather reports from place that does not exist","body":"Weather monitoring station 13010 of the Pirata programme is located at a place that does not really exist.

The makers of The Crowded Room have urged reviewers of this new drama not to give away “pivotal aspects of the storyline”, including A, B, or that C is a D. I certainly cannot tell you whether Es are or are not Fs. There are two major problems here. One is that not only does that amount to quite a lot of plot, but in The Crowded Room they are not the isolated moments that the phrase “pivotal points” suggests. Rather, they are matters that suffuse the whole telling of the tale of Danny Sullivan (Tom Holland), whose part in a shooting at the Rockefeller Center in the 1970s is gradually uncovered during a series of interviews with a gently persistent interrogator, Prof Rya Goodwin (Amanda Seyfried). The second problem is that I don’t know how this request for secrecy squares with the fact that the opening credit (which references the true crime book on which the series is based) will let the cat out of the bag for any remotely astute viewer. It is not necessary to have read the book – the title alone should do it. The producers must have been spitting feathers. So let us see what I can tell you about The Crowded Room while telling you as little as possible.

We meet him in the middle of the drama’s inciting incident, levelling a gun – seemingly due to the instigation of a girl called Ariana (Sasha Lane) – at a man in the Center, but failing to shoot him. Ariana grabs the gun as the man runs and succeeds in injuring but not killing him. Rya questions him about both the shooting and where the now missing Ariana might have gone, while detectives wonder – for as yet unspecified reasons – about whether they may have just arrested a serial killer. Under Rya’s interrogation, Danny fills in some of his backstory. How he got to know Ariana when her astonishingly tough Israeli landlord Yitzak (Lior Raz) saved him from being beaten up by kids from school outside his house and Danny ended up moving in as another lodger. How he and his two best friends, mercurial Jonny (Levon Hawke) and jock Mike (Sam Vartholomeos) are involved with pot dealing at school. How he has an on-off thing with a beautiful blond student called Isabel (Emma Laird) who has now gone off to college, as he might have done had life gone better for him. Interspersed with his answers are flashbacks to scenes that undercut what he is saying and suggest a darker narrative at work. Even without them, we have the sense that something – lots of things – are … off. Why is this unassuming lad suspected of multiple heinous crimes? Why is he being interviewed by a professor? Why do things keep not adding up for her when they do for him and – so far – for us? Why does a slight feeling of unreality persist even through the most naturalistic of scenes? This diffuse sense of unease and confusion is well done. But it goes on for a long, long time. The Crowded Room is a 10-episode series and the evasiveness, hints – a missing twin brother, abuse of various kind, hidden potential for violence – and drip-feeding of information start to seem wilfully long before the true unravelling of the mystery. I’m not sure whether working out early what is going on would take away from or add to the enjoyment – there is always pleasure to be had in seeing how this or that is being evoked or the unsuspecting viewer manipulated; without the mystery, I am not sure the narrative itself, so thinly spread, is enough to hold the attention. While this kind of part is always – for obvious reasons, though I can’t mention them because A-F – catnip to actors, and I would imagine especially so for one who has been strapped into the mighty Marvel machine for as long as Holland has, I’m not sure he quite makes the necessary leap. An actor needs to hold the audience’s attention even as an Everyman figure and – no thanks to an unscintillating script – Holland is too quiet a presence to compel. Seyfried puts in a fine performance, but it feels like a bland comedown from her last outing as that walking bundle of contradictions Elizabeth Holmes in The Dropout. That said, I haven’t watched the back half of the series, so perhaps things tighten and liven up there. I hope so.

The fringe, regarded until the pandemic as the world’s largest arts event, is fighting to rebuild its finances and win back audiences after the twin shocks of Covid and the economic crises triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Liz Truss’s short-lived government last year. Fringe executives have adopted the slogan “fill yer boots” for this year’s event, in an effort to persuade audiences to watch as many shows as possible. Shona McCarthy, its chief executive, said productions from 64 countries, as well as the UK’s four home nations, had booked to take part. “I think it is a strong indication that artists, that creatives, are looking for those opportunities to have their work seen in other places again. So that’s exciting,” she said. This year’s event also features 50 lesser-known and experimental productions that have, for the first time, been given £2,000 grants as part of a £100,000 initiative called Keep it Fringe, part-funded by the Fleabag star Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the fringe’s honorary president. Lyndsey Jackson, the fringe’s deputy chief executive, said the initiative was massively oversubscribed. Nearly 680 performers applied to the fund. McCarthy said in future years the fund could need up to £500,000 to meet that demand. The fund was designed to uphold the festival’s core ethos, Jackson said, to support artists “doing something bold, that’s ambitious, maybe a bit daring [and] actually high risk”. The fringe was shut down in 2020 during the Covid lockdowns and began re-establishing itself slowly in 2021, initially leaning heavily on streaming many shows. While the number of overseas countries represented in August’s festival is higher than the 59 in 2019, when sales records were broken, this year’s event remains noticeably smaller. At 3,013, the number of shows this year is 21% lower than in 2019, with venues and productions down 23% and 24% respectively. Shona McCarthy, the chief executive of the fringe, says the festival needs financial ‘attention’. Photograph: David Cheskin/AP McCarthy said the recent health and economic crises exposed how fragile the fringe’s finances had become: “It was already stretched to the seams, even in 2019,” she said. “I would say Covid has been an accelerant … [the festival] needs help and it needs attention.” The fringe has frozen its registration fee for performers for 16 years, with average ticket prices at £12. It is pressuring the Scottish government, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and Edinburgh council to offer tax breaks, reduce fees and increase subsidies to ensure the event survives. Related: Encore! Surefire shows returning for the Edinburgh festival in 2023 The UK government has offered the fringe, which is spread across three cramped city-centre offices, up to £7m to build a new headquarters in a Victorian primary school. McCarthy said venues needed tax breaks, while the council should also waive the daily tourist tax, to be introduced on hotel and guest-room beds for performers and backstage crew. “We would argue that artists are key workers,” she said. “It has not really been recognised as the mega event that it is,” McCarthy added. “Because this festival has grown organically over 75 years, there is just this expectation because we pull it off every year, every venue, all the artists taking the risk to come here, and because we keep making it happen, everyone assumes it will keep happening. “I think the risk here is that we’re all still smiling, there’s an amazing programme this year but there are very few organisations across the fringe landscape that are not carrying debt from the last three years. Certainly there’s nobody I know of that has any reserves of any kind left. Everybody is hanging on by such a thin thread.” • The Edinburgh festival fringe takes place from 4-28 August.","Id":"culture/2023/jun/08/edinburgh-festival-fringe-2023-artists-countries-shows-covid","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Edinburgh festival fringe 2023 to host artists from nearly 70 countries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/08/edinburgh-festival-fringe-2023-artists-countries-shows-covid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2023/jun/08/edinburgh-festival-fringe-2023-artists-countries-shows-covid","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts","wordcount":629,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T05:00:03Z","id":"culture/2023/jun/08/edinburgh-festival-fringe-2023-artists-countries-shows-covid","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Fact check: why Rowan Atkinson is wrong about electric vehicles","body":"In a widely shared comment piece for the Guardian, comedian Rowan Atkinson said he felt “duped” by the green claims about electric vehicles (EVs). In support of his contention, however, Atkinson repeats a series of repeatedly debunked talking points, often used by those seeking to delay action on the climate crisis. Moreover, he suggests alternatives to EVs that are not yet widely available, would be less beneficial to the climate and are guaranteed to be more costly. Atkinson’s biggest mistake is his failure to recognise that electric vehicles already offer significant global environmental benefits, compared with combustion-engine cars. While EVs won’t solve all of the problems associated with car use – from traffic congestion through to our increasingly sedentary lifestyles – they are an essential part of tackling the climate emergency. In its latest report, for example, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said, with “high confidence”, that EVs have lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventional cars. The IPCC said that electric vehicles not only “offer the greatest low-carbon potential for land-based transport”, but their use would save money. (Despite elevated electricity prices, EVs are still much cheaper to run than petrol cars in the UK.) Indeed, without a widespread shift to EVs, there is no plausible route to meeting the UK’s legally binding target of net zero greenhouse emissions by 2050 – and the same is true globally. Contrary to Atkinson’s article, EVs cut emissions in the “bigger picture” taking into account vehicles’ full life cycles, from the extraction of oil or mining of lithium for batteries through to actually driving the cars. As Carbon Brief noted some years ago, EVs already cut planet-warming emissions by two-thirds on a life cycle basis relative to combustion engine cars in the UK – and the benefits are growing. Atkinson cites Volvo figures showing emissions from producing EVs to be 70% higher. This is misdirection. While many details of the Volvo study have been thoroughly debunked, the more important issue is that the emissions from producing batteries, while significant, are quickly outweighed by the CO2 emissions from fuelling petrol and diesel cars. Atkinson is also wrong to say that the UK government’s plan to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 “seems to be based on conclusions drawn from only one part of a car’s operating life: what comes out of the exhaust pipe”. For starters, the government’s cost-benefit analysis of its policy plans for cars talks in detail about life cycle emissions. Specifically, it mentions government-commissioned research that proves EVs offer a large and growing emissions benefit on a life cycle basis. Echoing Carbon Brief’s findings, the analysis says: “BEVs [battery electric vehicles] are expected to reduce GHG emissions by 65% compared to a petrol car today, and this rises to 76% by 2030.” That same analysis gives one answer to Atkinson’s touting of hydrogen as an “interesting alternative fuel” to replace petrol and diesel. The research shows that hydrogen vehicles would only cut emissions by 39% today, relative to petrol engines, potentially rising to 56% by 2030. Another answer is that there are still only 72,000 hydrogen-fuelled fuel-cell vehicles on the planet, accounting for a tiny fraction of the roughly 1.5bn cars on the road globally. In comparison, about 14m EVs are due to be sold this year alone, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Even Toyota, the carmarker most closely associated with pushing hydrogen vehicles and cited in Atkinson’s article, has recently started to follow the rest of the market in shifting towards EVs. Atkinson goes on to suggest hydrogen for trucks, inaccurately claiming electrification is a “non-starter” due to the weight of batteries. Yet manufacturers sold 60,000 electric trucks last year and now have 220 heavy-duty vehicle models on the market, according to the IEA. European electric truck sales grew fourfold in the first quarter of this year alone, according to Volvo. As Auke Hoekstra at the Eindhoven University of Technology has argued, electric trucks will not have a major weight disadvantage over diesels. More importantly, says Hoekstra, they will be much cheaper to own and run. The main problem with hydrogen vehicles is the same as for the “synthetic fuel” that Atkinson is also keen to promote. Specifically, both of these alternatives are incredibly inefficient, requiring many times more energy to drive the same distance. Figures from NGO Transport and Environment show EVs can be driven two to five times further on the same energy as would be needed if using hydrogen or synthetic fuels. This thermodynamic disadvantage inevitably makes these alternatives much more costly to run than EVs. A few of Atkinson’s other claims are worth mentioning. He says EV batteries only last “about 10 years”. Yet “most modern lithium-ion units are likely to last the lifetime of the car”, according to Autocar. Tesla’s batteries are “designed to outlast the vehicle”. He complains that new cars are only kept for three years before being sold. Yet he does not reference the secondhand market, and the fact that British people are keeping their cars for longer than ever. He claims that it is better to keep running old petrol cars than to replace them with EVs. Yet a new EV would start benefiting the climate in less than four years, relative to an old combustion engine. He claims that lithium-ion batteries contain rare earth elements. They do not. In concluding, Atkinson says people should “hold fire” on EVs. This is linked to the false premise that EVs “will be of real, global environmental benefit one day, but that day has yet to dawn”. The alternatives he promotes are not yet widely available, are less beneficial for the environment – and are thermodynamically guaranteed to be much more costly. In contrast, and contrary to Atkinson’s central claim, EVs already offer significant emissions savings – and their widespread use is central to meeting UK and global climate goals.

While some commentators regard the first-of-its-kind home loan as a “revolutionary” way to get people out of the rental trap and on to the property ladder, others have likened it to the risky loans that contributed to the 2007-08 financial crash. Skipton’s move appears particularly daring considering its timing: a mere couple of weeks after the mortgage was launched, UK banks and building societies pulled almost 800 residential and buy-to-let mortgage deals in a matter of days, amid growing concerns over future interest rate rises. Martha*, a 35-year-old mother from London, said the announcement of Skipton’s Track Record Mortgage, which allows eligible first-time buyers to buy a home without a deposit, has given her fresh hope, despite the market turmoil. “My husband and I will definitely be applying for the 100% mortgage,” she said. “Although there is clearly a lot of risk involved, I do not see how else we will afford to buy a home. We have rented for the past six years and despite our best efforts we have not been able to save enough for a deposit.” Martha is a qualified social worker but left work to be able to look after the couple’s two children due to the cost of childcare. “Now our second child is three years old, our childcare costs will go down significantly in September and I will be able to return to work. This will increase our overall income and how much we can save. However, with the cost of living, even with two decent salaries – totalling just under £100,000 per year – it would take us years to save enough for a deposit. Neither of us have access to any generational wealth.” The couple spends approximately £2,000 on monthly rent and bills, which, Martha said, would be equivalent to paying for a mortgage and bills. “We have looked into other schemes for first-time buyers. The 5% deposit scheme was an option, but we haven’t even been able to save 5% because of rising living costs. I am optimistic that a 100% mortgage would really help us and we would be able to afford to pay all the other associated costs, if given the opportunity.” Martha is one of dozens of people who responded to a Guardian callout that asked renters in the UK whether they would apply for a 100% home loan. While various respondents said they were interested in obtaining such a mortgage, few appeared to be eligible for Skipton’s no-deposit loan, as house prices in their areas were much higher than the maximum amount they would be able to borrow. Sam, who has rented in London and Surrey for six years, could be persuaded to relocate to a cheaper area of the country in order to qualify for a 100% home loan. Photograph: Marianne Chua Photography Sam, 27, the head of department at an independent school, from London, was among a number of people who said they would not be able to apply unless they moved. “Applying for a 100% mortgage is definitely something I’m seriously thinking about, but two-bed properties would be in the £450,000-£500,000 price range, so buying in London is not an option with this mortgage, even with a decent wage of over £60,000,” he said. “I’d consider moving further out, though, finding a new job and buying something cheaper and smaller. I’m obviously concerned about the fluctuation of the housing market at the moment, and with a 100% mortgage you’re relying on the value of your property increasing, or you’ll lose money – which is a distinct possibility. But owning something is better than nothing, and I could begin building capital instead of wasting tens of thousands on rent every year.” Apart from being first-time buyers, each applicant to Skipton’s 100% mortgage must have less than a 5% deposit, no missed payments on debts or credit commitments over the past six months, proof of having paid at least 12 months’ rent in a row during the past 18 months, and experience of paying all household bills, including utility bills and council tax, for at least 12 months in a row during the previous 18-month period. Daniel Winter, 41, a project manager at local government and a father-of-two from Matlock in Derbyshire, attempted to apply for the mortgage, but was turned down by the lender’s affordability algorithm. “My wife, Helen, and I have tried and failed miserably to save enough for a deposit. We only have £6,000 saved up towards a mortgage, which we could have used to pay for fees and moving costs.” Daniel Winter and his wife, Helen, were lucky to find a cheap rental property, but for the purposes of securing a Skipton mortgage this proved to be a disadvantage. Photograph: Daniel Winter/Guardian Community The couple were initially deemed eligible for a Skipton home loan of up to £105,951, which was based on their – relatively modest – monthly rent payments of £650 over the previous six months, their rental “track record”. However, when Winter reached the second step of the application – the affordability calculator – the amount offered was even lower. “I entered my income of £43,000 and £12,000 for my wife, and asked for £220,000, which is the absolute minimum we would have to spend on a house to stay in this area. But the affordability calculator said the maximum I could borrow was £37,750,” Winter said. “Bear in mind, my outgoings are very low, with just a small loan for a car and about £500 on a credit card.” Skipton’s lending criteria specify that applicants for its 100% mortgage can only borrow the lower amount after completing the track record calculator and its affordability calculator. “We know our rent is an absolute bargain, but this means that, based on our rent record, this 100% mortgage couldn’t work anyway, because it would limit us to borrowing just £105,951.” Winter said. “It is really frustrating. I am already paying for a mortgage – just not for my own.” Nico*, a self-employed business owner from Bath, shared Winter’s concerns over the fact that the Skipton no-deposit mortgage can only work for people who had spent substantial amounts on their rent previously. “This product rewards renters who have chosen to or have had to pay really high rents, and people who are able to move from a place with expensive rents to a place with much less expensive prices for a first home,” he said. “People who are not overpaying for their monthly rent and are slowly accruing a deposit, however, will still be no better off, as this product simply won’t help them in purchasing a family home.” Nico said he fears that Skipton’s 100% mortgage may price renters in cheaper parts of the country out of their own areas. He said: “People like myself, who live in stable and affordable rented accommodation, might even be worse off in some places if renters can secure a home loan after taking their big city rental cost and moving into smaller local communities.” *Names have been changed","Id":"money/2023/jun/08/it-would-really-help-us-renters-who-want-a-100-mortgage","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webTitle":"‘It would really help us’: renters in the UK who want a 100% mortgage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/08/it-would-really-help-us-renters-who-want-a-100-mortgage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2023/jun/08/it-would-really-help-us-renters-who-want-a-100-mortgage","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle","wordcount":1122,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T05:00:03Z","id":"money/2023/jun/08/it-would-really-help-us-renters-who-want-a-100-mortgage","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Notes on a scandal: this is how Starmer’s bullies took out Jamie Driscoll – and why it matters","body":"I first met the man who has been all over this week’s political headlines four years ago, 300 miles up the A1 from Westminster. It was a bitterly cold Saturday morning in the Northumberland coastal town of Newbiggin and Jamie Driscoll was asking for votes. He’d just caused a minor political earthquake by winning Labour members’ support to run for the new position of mayor of North of Tyne. The cert for that role had been Nick Forbes, Newcastle council leader and longtime big beast – not Driscoll, who had been a local councillor for a few months and who, on winning the selection, had had to rush out to buy his only suit. I watched this stubbly, scruffy, upbeat outsider doorknock around an estate of small houses and exotic garden statuettes, to a reaction chillier than the wind whipping in from the North Sea. For decades, this had been Labour country, where that political tradition ran through the local economy, its institutions and people’s very identities. But over the past 50 years all that had been destroyed and now it was the land of Vote Leave, desolate and nihilistic. If residents spoke to canvassers at all, it was to spit out statements like “I don’t follow politics”. After more slammed doors, one activist sighed: “Policy doesn’t matter here. They’ve forgotten what government can do.” For all Driscoll’s ideas and energy, I wrote at the time, his biggest challenge would be closing the vast gulf between the governed and their governors. That tableau has come to mind many times since the Labour party barred Driscoll from standing for re-election. No more will he trigger democratic earthquakes. Instead, he has become fodder for lobby journalists. When I met him in Newcastle this week, he was slaloming between interviews for Radio 4, ITV, national newspapers, Newsnight and more. The ending of his political career has done more for his national profile than four years in office. I listened as each outlet demanded its shot of Westminster caffeine. Hardly anyone asked what it meant for the north-east, for local democracy, for the people in Newbiggin and anyone else who long ago tuned out all politicians as fraudulent liars only in it for themselves. And why wouldn’t they? I have chased down and sifted through evidence, much of it never revealed before, and it points to a stitch-up bigger than anything on the Great Sewing Bee. The jumped-up outsider, Driscoll, has been tossed in the bin – but he is merely collateral damage in a one-sided Labour factional fight, whose actors appear not to give a damn for people’s reputations or for the public they’re meant to serve. Let’s work backwards. Labour officials blocked Driscoll last Friday, soon after he’d been interviewed by a panel drawn largely from the party’s national executive committee. The email he received reads: “[T]he NEC panel has determined that you will not be progressing further as a candidate in this process.” But while the party gave no official reason to the candidate, its enforcers were happy to brief lobby journalists – who in turn quoted anonymous sources that it was because in March he had appeared at a Newcastle theatre with Ken Loach to discuss his films. The renowned director had been expelled as a Labour member in 2021. Jamie Driscoll addresses the Transport for the North conference in March. Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images On Sunday, Labour frontbencher Jonathan Reynolds told Sky News that Driscoll was excluded for sharing a platform with “someone who themselves has been expelled for their views on antisemitism” – a line swiftly amplified by the media, yet not quite true. I asked Loach’s office to forward his letters of expulsion, which say only that he is “ineligible” due to his support of “a political organisation other than an official Labour group”. That was Labour Against the Witchhunt, which did claim allegations of Labour antisemitism were “politically motivated”. Reynolds was conflating the two. I asked how many other journalists had sought clarification. The answer was one. A column about Driscoll is not the place to litigate Ken Loach’s views, even if I disagree with much of what he says about Labour’s treatment of antisemitism. It barely needs saying that sitting on stage with a director to discuss their films does not mean you share all their opinions. Far more troubling for British democracy is how anonymous, factional briefings are simply machine-pressed into newspaper “facts” then spewed out on TV. “They were always looking to get me,” Driscoll claimed this week. I have read emails dating back to 2020 where the new metro mayor asks Labour officials for the party’s local membership lists used by councillors, MPs and mayors as standard. But not here: IT issues meant the lists supposedly weren’t shareable. Until this year that is, when he was told the upcoming mayoral contest meant he could only access lists “if you make a confirmation that you are not seeking the selection”. Another email, sent by Driscoll last month to party officials, notes that a local constituency party has been told by a senior official to disinvite him from speaking. Asked for comment, Labour didn’t reply – but this is petty, attritional stuff, which is what happens when politics is evacuated of ideas and arguments and becomes simply about who is in whose good books. Cliqueishness is hardly exclusive to Keir Starmer’s Labour, but it is starker now because instead of real politics all this lot have is office politics. Related: Keir Starmer says he wants to empower local communities. The Jamie Driscoll affair suggests otherwise | Simon Jenkins Which brings us back to the much-discussed NEC panel, supposedly to divine his suitability to stand. I have viewed footage of the entire hour on Zoom, which discusses nothing of Driscoll’s beliefs or achievements. Three of the five panel members are from groups on the right of the party, and all anyone wants to know is why he spoke to Loach. They refer to the director’s “controversial views” and quote the Jewish Chronicle’s coverage. How, they ask, might the event be viewed by a “hostile media”? Driscoll replies that Holocaust denial is “abhorrent” and that he has signed up to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism. He recalls how he used to fight fascists in the street. None of it is good enough. A rather bumptious young man informs the mayor that “you can’t separate someone’s views from their work”. The twentysomething declares that Driscoll shouldn’t have discussed the films but instead attacked Loach’s politics. On that basis, Starmer ought to be disqualified for appearing with Loach on the BBC’s Question Time – and so too should the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, who in 2019 wrote a paean in this paper to Loach’s Sorry We Missed You, praising the way it “brings across how the right to a family life has been eroded in modern Britain”. We all know that a week is a long time in Starmer’s politics, but he did once proclaim a proud regionalism. Now what’s left? Attacking McCarthyism, Ed Murrow told his TV audience: “We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another.” By these standards, Driscoll is a victim of McCarthyism. The office he holds is now a mere electoral toy to be enjoyed by a favoured faction. And those people in Newbiggin and Ashington and anyone else who might be looking on with half an eye will see nothing but machine politicians serving themselves.

The chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, will take to the Bafta stage to unveil features in the app – with actor Edward Norton, a longtime Uber backer and climate campaigner, flying in to add a little Hollywood fizz. The choice of London is not accidental: a city that leads the way for Uber in electric vehicle uptake, doubling EV numbers since early 2022 to host 10,000 of the 60,000 registered on the app worldwide. Uber has targeted a fully electric fleet in London by the end of 2025 – an ambition that looks a tall order if it hopes to keep the current number of 45,000 registered vehicles in action. The transition is partly facilitated by a £145m clean air fund Uber banked from levies on trips between 2019 and 2022 into individual pots for drivers to buy or subsidise renting an EV, shepherded in by Brem’s predecessor, Jamie Heywood (who now runs a solar power firm in Germany). Brem, meanwhile, isn’t just topping up his salary by driving to get the view from the shop floor; he wanted to go through the process last year when Uber was struggling for drivers as labour shortages bit. Even for a “vanilla” type, as he puts it, with a fixed address and being adept with the admin, the Transport for London licensing process took him eight months. Uber has had an uneasy past with TfL but Brem acknowledges the wider context of city policies as being the major factor in EV growth. The congestion charge and the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) have been significant incentives to electrify – and since the start of 2023, Transport for London has only licensed private hire vehicles that are zero-emissions capable. London has more of the UK’s 43,000 chargers than other regions, and TfL and the mayor, Sadiq Khan, are to unveil more, but the capital’s relative success masks inequalities. Much is in the hands of boroughs – and wealthier boroughs have more public chargers. “Not where I’d argue they are most needed,” Brem says, “in Redbridge, Brent or Newham, where people drive most and where most of our drivers are.” One Uber driver he met has taken to throwing a cable out of the window of his second-floor flat, for convenience and cost-saving: “The difference between charging overnight at home or rocking up to a Tesla supercharger is absolutely enormous.” Andrew Brem, general manager of Uber UK, has obtained his own licence to drive passengers in London. Photograph: Uber Returning to the Guardian offices, Brem, the former chief commercial officer of British Airways, forgets to officially end the booked ride as our interview continues. A warning message pops up on his phone, with an invitation to watch an instructional video on sexual harassment policies – a reminder of Uber’s efforts to clean up in other ways after concerns over safety and checks on drivers that saw its London licence imperilled for a second time in 2019. As the Guardian’s collaborative investigation into the company, the Uber files, underlined, the firm has had an unsavoury history of attempting to circumvent rules around the globe. Brem says Uber is a very different place now: “We’ve all seen the movie and read the files. That was the past.” Now, he says, they “influence with integrity”. He is still not happy about court rulings in Britain that demanded Uber treats drivers as workers. Brem claims those regulations “have not caught up with the gig economy … or are ridiculously bureaucratic or unfair, where competitors are not complying”. But he says Uber follows the rules, whether it likes them or not: “The culture is not conservative or staid but it is nonetheless one that takes obligations very seriously. We just try and change them.”","Id":"environment/2023/jun/08/uber-aims-for-greener-trips-and-to-expand-london-electric-vehicle-fleet","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webTitle":"Uber aims for greener trips and to expand London electric vehicle fleet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/uber-aims-for-greener-trips-and-to-expand-london-electric-vehicle-fleet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jun/08/uber-aims-for-greener-trips-and-to-expand-london-electric-vehicle-fleet","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":775,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T05:00:03Z","id":"environment/2023/jun/08/uber-aims-for-greener-trips-and-to-expand-london-electric-vehicle-fleet","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Crypto ads will need to carry risk warnings under new UK rules","body":"Crypto firms must warn customers they should not expect protection if their investment goes wrong and introduce a “cooling off” period for first-time investors, under new rules imposed by the UK financial watchdog. The Financial Conduct Authority said that from 8 October firms promoting crypto products or services would need to carry a clear risk warning in their adverts. The FCA said an example of such a notification would include telling customers they should not expect protection “if something goes wrong” and ought to be “prepared to lose all the money you invest”. Customers should be urged to “take two mins to learn more”, the FCA added. Companies advertising crypto assets, including cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, will need to offer a pause to new investors requesting to invest in their products. Bonuses for introducing friends to a crypto firm’s products will also be prohibited. Related: ‘It’s a massive ask’: is Binance capable of being regulated? Sheldon Mills, executive director of consumers and competition at the FCA, said consumers should understand that the crypto industry remains largely unregulated, with the lack of a safety net putting investors at risk of losing all their money. “It is up to people to decide whether they buy crypto. But research shows many regret making a hasty decision. Our rules give people the time and the right risk warnings to make an informed choice,” he said. “Consumers should still be aware that crypto remains largely unregulated and high risk. Those who invest should be prepared to lose all their money.” The FCA said research showed that estimated crypto ownership in the UK more than doubled between 2021 and 2022. According to an FCA-commissioned survey, 10% of respondents said they owned crypto assets. The watchdog has also warned that cryptoasset fraud is on the rise, with reports of crypto scams climbing from 1,619 in 2019 to 6,372 in 2021. The FCA said some crypto promotions had already been censured by the Advertising Standards Authority including an advert by Luno, a cryptocurrency exchange, that appeared on the London Underground and London bus networks that said: “If you’re seeing Bitcoin on the Underground, it’s time to buy.” The ASA also ruled in 2021 that a Facebook advert for a fan token issued by Arsenal football club trivialised investing in crypto. The FCA said the new rules brought crypto in line with a regime introduced last year for misleading adverts related to high-risk investments. Further regulation is on the way for crypto firms in the UK. In February, the Treasury published a consultation document on bringing crypto regulation in line with traditional assets such as stocks and bonds.","Id":"technology/2023/jun/08/crypto-ads-risk-warnings-fca-uk-rules-october","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webTitle":"Crypto ads will need to carry risk warnings under new UK rules","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/08/crypto-ads-risk-warnings-fca-uk-rules-october","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/jun/08/crypto-ads-risk-warnings-fca-uk-rules-october","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":428,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T05:00:02Z","id":"technology/2023/jun/08/crypto-ads-risk-warnings-fca-uk-rules-october","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Kakhovka dam collapse before and after: satellite images reveal extent of flood disaster in Ukraine","body":"Satellite images from Ukraine have revealed the extent of the flooding in the country’s south, after the region’s Kakhovka dam and hydroelectric station were largely destroyed. The critical dam, which lies along the Dnipro River in Ukraine’s Kherson region – now held by Russia – collapsed on Tuesday, flooding a swathe of the war’s frontline. Related: A visual guide to the collapse of Ukraine’s Nova Kakhovka dam Up to 100 settlements have been threatened by flooding and thousands of people have been evacuated from the local area. Ukraine has blamed Russian occupying forces of blowing up the dam in an attempt to slow an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive. Western allies have called for investigations while offering support to Ukraine. A US official said more information would be necessary but appeared to blame Russia for the disaster. “Why would Ukraine do this to its own territory and people, flood its land, force tens of thousands of people to leave their homes – it doesn’t make sense,” deputy US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, said. For its part, Russia has accused Kyiv of sabotaging the dam to deprive Russian-controlled Crimea of the freshwater it receives from the reservoir. Interactive The satellite images taken by Maxar technologies show the devastating results of flooding in towns and villages along the Dnipro river. Over 17,000 people have been evacuated from settlements that lay in the path of the flooding. The images show houses and buildings submerged in water, with many having only their roofs showing, and water taking over parks, land and infrastructure. Interactive Images of the Russian occupied city of Oleshky show the extent of the flooding. Local media, citing the exiled mayor of the city, say three people have died in the flooding there. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said it was impossible to predict how many people would die in Russian-occupied parts of Kherson due to the flooding, urging a “clear and rapid reaction from the world” to support victims. Interactive UN aid chief Martin Griffiths told the UN security council that “the sheer magnitude of the catastrophe will only become fully realised in the coming days.” Local homes and farms have been inundated with water. Once the scale of the disaster became clear, an adviser to Ukraine’s president said, “a global ecological disaster is playing out now … and thousands of animals and ecosystems will be destroyed in the next few hours”.

This sentence doesn’t usually elicit a collective groan of despair, but after three arid weeks, the gardeners of south-west England are entitled to sigh a bit. In my local Fox’s Field, volunteers from Wellington’s Transition Town group are hauling water from the stream up the slope to carefully rehydrate the herbs in their newly planted forest garden. The ground is covered with a layer of woodchip, hay and municipal soil improver. It has been so toasted by the sun that you can crumble it in your fingers like granola. At intervals, tufts of green poke up through the mulch: oregano and lemon balm, bergamot and sweet cicely, chamomile and clary sage. Over the past month, 273 plants have been planted, with 198 still to go, representing hundreds of volunteer hours, and costing about £1,800 in grant money. There’s a lot at stake. The last rain fell in biblical proportions. On 9 May, the air turned beige, lightning crackled, and thunder rolled from Blackdowns to Quantocks and back again like a timpani section gone mad. The rain, when it finally fell, hammered the freshly ploughed fields, blasting away the topsoil like a pressure washer. Roads turned into rivers, carrying away whatever nutrients farmers had applied, and rivers boiled with frothy Nescafé-coloured water. Half the average month’s rain fell in the space of 24 hours. Volunteers for Transition Town Wellington at work. Photograph: Anita Corbin It’s not so much the quantity as the quality of the rain that’s the issue: a “wet” month isn’t much use if it all falls at once. Quite the opposite, in fact. And after the flood, the run of bone-dry days and chilly nights have made the usually soggy south-west feel like the high sierras. No wonder the plants are struggling. In the forest garden, the team has spent the past 18 months suppressing the grass with cardboard, hay and woodchip, and in one section a huge sheet of black plastic. Not only does this “no dig” method help retain the soil structure, and avoid releasing carbon into the atmosphere as conventional ploughing does, it also provides the soil with a protective layer. It is less likely to dry out, is more stable and absorbent, and therefore richer in nutrients and microbial activity. But if the current conditions prevail, without the intervention of these water-bearing humans, even these lucky plants will eventually die. We walk back to the river in evening’s golden light, our empty watering cans swinging. • Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary","Id":"environment/2023/jun/08/country-diary-we-live-in-hope-of-rain-a-normal-amount-of-rain","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webTitle":"Country diary: We live in hope of rain – a normal amount of rain | Anita Roy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/country-diary-we-live-in-hope-of-rain-a-normal-amount-of-rain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jun/08/country-diary-we-live-in-hope-of-rain-a-normal-amount-of-rain","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":414,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T04:30:02Z","id":"environment/2023/jun/08/country-diary-we-live-in-hope-of-rain-a-normal-amount-of-rain","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Influenza vaccinations recommended as cases of respiratory illness rise across Australia","body":"A range of respiratory illnesses are on the rise in Australia as the colder weather hits, with the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza in particular steeply increasing. Related: Flu cases are on the rise across Australia. Do I need a winter vaccination? The latest Australian influenza surveillance report shows that in the fortnight to 28 May almost all jurisdictions saw a rise in respiratory illnesses. Of the 57,816 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza reported to the government this year, 30% were recorded in the latest fortnightly reporting period. The proportion of people taking time off work also increased, the report said. Since April there have been 518 hospital admissions of people with confirmed influenza, of which 37 were admitted directly to intensive care. However, the number of influenza cases in the community are in line with historical data. The majority (75%) of influenza cases so far this year are influenza A, one of the most common types of influenza virus. Influenza B is also being commonly detected. Chart of influenza notifications from the flu-tracking report. Photograph: Department of Health Influenza notification rates have been highest in the Northern Territory (572 notifications per 100,000 people) followed by Queensland (343 notifications per 100,000 people). A medical virologist with NSW Health Pathology, Prof Dominic Dwyer, said; “This is the start of winter virus activity”. “There is plenty of Covid-19 as well as influenza A and B and RSV,” he said. RSV is short for respiratory syncytial virus, which mostly affects young children and can cause a chest infection called bronchiolitis. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Influenza B is about a third of influenza detections at the moment,” Dwyer said. “Make sure you are vaccinated against influenza, as the vaccine covers the influenza A and B viruses.” Meanwhile nationally 38,618 cases of Covid-19 were reported in the week to 30 May, an average of 5,517 cases per day. This is a 6.2% decline from the previous week. But in the fortnight to 28 May, Covid-19 remained the most commonly detected respiratory virus in New South Wales and Tasmania. Interactive Guardian Australia’s tracking of Covid hospitalisation data shows the number of weekly hospitalisations has increased from around 1,288 people in March to 2,771 in June, but the spike in hospitalisation data remains below the January wave. States and territories reported a total of 184 Covid deaths in the week ending 2 June, according to Covid-tracking website Covidlive. Interactive In the year-to-date, influenza cases have been highest in children aged five to nine years, followed by those aged zero to four, and then 10–14. People can be infectious with influenza from the day before symptom onset, and while adults are most infectious in the first three to five days of their illness, children can remain infectious for up to 10 days, NSW Health reports. The Australian influenza surveillance report does not provide a full picture of influenza, as different states, territories, hospitals and health services have different methods of reporting. But it shows in the fortnight to 28 May, an average of 5.3 per 1,000 consultations with a GP were due to influenza-like illnesses, compared with 3.7 the previous fortnight. In South Australia rhinovirus, which causes the common cold, was most common. Influenza A was the most common respiratory illness diagnosed in WA, while SARS-CoV-2 and picornavirus, which can cause the common cold, were most common in Victoria. More than 16.5 million Australians have not received a Covid-19 booster shot in over six months, the Australian Medical Association’s president, Dr Steve Robson, said on Thursday. “The age of lockdowns and restrictions is over, so it’s understandable why many people are falling into a false sense of security, but the latest data shows the virus is infecting thousands of Australians every day,” Robson said. Robson said Covid-19 boosters and flu shots are separate vaccines that could be safely administered at the same time, and urged people to get vaccinated.","Id":"australia-news/2023/jun/08/influenza-vaccinations-recommended-as-cases-of-respiratory-illness-rise-across-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Influenza vaccinations recommended as cases of respiratory illness rise across Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/08/influenza-vaccinations-recommended-as-cases-of-respiratory-illness-rise-across-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jun/08/influenza-vaccinations-recommended-as-cases-of-respiratory-illness-rise-across-australia","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":633,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T03:21:01Z","id":"australia-news/2023/jun/08/influenza-vaccinations-recommended-as-cases-of-respiratory-illness-rise-across-australia","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"NBA finals Game 3: Denver Nuggets 109-94 Miami Heat – as it happened","body":"4.18am BST Related: Nikola Jokić’s historic night lifts Denver to Game 3 win over Miami in NBA finals 4.14am BST Final thoughts Well, I predicted the Denver Nuggets would win, but I predicted it wouldn’t be a blowout.

No matter, Gordon benefits from another Joker assist for an alley-oop and it’s a nine-point Denver lead. 2.57am BST Start of the second half Nuggets 55-48 Heat, 11:26, 3rd quarter And we’re back from advertising heck to start the second half! Jokić gets the scoring started to give the Nuggets their largest lead of the game. 2.55am BST Game 3 has been the one for the stars.....Jokic and Murray have combined to score over half of Denver's points Jimmy and Bam have combined to score over half of Miami's points — Tony Jones (@Tjonesonthenba) June 8, 2023 I’m very thankful for this particular tweet because would have figured this out myself on account of the “not great doing math on the fly” thing. 2.52am BST “Welcome to ABC’s Halftime Extremely Long Advertisement Break Show sponsored by Literally Every Brand.” 2.48am BST As a big cat among the smaller felines, Nikola Jokić gets scratched awfully lot... \uD83E\uDDD0 Whaddaya think, @HunterFelt – should The Joker \uD83E\uDD21 have some of those scratches tattooed? \uD83D\uDC3A pic.twitter.com/hunVKQ9g1V — WolfPrincess (@MontLupus) June 8, 2023 The problem with fouling Jokić is the same with fouling prime Shaq, who I think is a somewhat comparable player: sometimes you might end up being the one who ends up worse for the wear. 2.48am BST Stars — They’re Just Like Us!

Photograph: Robby Illanes/NBAE/Getty Images Updated at 3.18am BST 2.45am BST Why Denver leads Jamal Murray has 20 points, leading all scorers, alongside 4 assists and 2 rebounds Nikola Jokić has 14 points, 12 rebounds and 7 assists. I am going to assume he is going to have yet another playoff triple-double. That is the division of labor that works for Denver. Miami is going to have to be the team making the halftime adjustments, but they have done that all postseason long. 2.42am BST Halftime thoughts The Nuggets have a five-point lead, which is a lot for this particular game. This feels like it’s going to be a close one, which I feel is going to benefit the Nuggets but it’s hard to tell this early in a back-and-forth affair. In any case, that was probably the best half of the finals so far. We’ve gone very far from the Game 1 snoozer. Updated at 2.42am BST 2.39am BST Nuggets 53-48 Heat, end of the first half Adebayo gets to the line, the second foul on Jokić. He makes both free throws and then draws a foul on Martin, using a bit of acting skills. He makes both free throws and that’s the end of the first half. 2.37am BST Nuggets 51-46 Heat, 1:27, 2nd quarter Aaron Gordon with a dunk. That’s good! Then he picks up his third foul. That’s bad! 2.35am BST Nuggets 49-46 Heat, 1:34, 2nd quarter Playoff Butler scores again. Murray gets a layup on an Adebayo goaltend. 2.34am BST Nuggets 47-44 Heat, 2:28, 2nd quarter Vincent picks up his third foul, another iffy call, that negates what probably would have been a turnover. Aaron Gordon misses both. Ball don’t lie. 2.33am BST Nuggets 47-44 Heat, 2:49, 2nd quarter Lowry gets called for a foul that should be on Adebayo. Interesting to see if that will have ramifications. Jokić goes to the line, obviously he makes both free throws. 2.30am BST Nuggets 45-44 Heat, 2:52, 2nd quarter Strus fouls Murray who makes 1-of-2 free throws. Tie game. Then it’s Adebayo with a massive slam which forces the ABC audio to go on mute to prevent us from hearing dirty words. Murray hits a three-pointer for Denver. What a wild one this is. 2.29am BST Nuggets 41-42 Heat, 4:04, 2nd quarter Strus for a three! The Heat regain the lead! What a ping pong affair we have going here, to borrow the title from a classic punk song. 2.28am BST Nuggets 41-39 Heat, 4:36, 2nd quarter Butler, the Heat’s offensive key, cut it down to a one-possession game with a jumper. 2.26am BST Murray has 14 points and if he’s going to be the Finals MVP like I predicted before the series started, it will be because of this: when the Nuggets are operating their offense, he’s the guy that tends to benefit scoring-wise. 2.23am BST Nuggets 41-37 Heat, 5:36, 2nd quarter Murray with another three-pointer and Heat coach Erik Spoelstra has seen enough, he calls for a timeout. 2.22am BST Nuggets 38-37 Heat, 6:40, 2nd quarter Murray hits a long ball to cut it to one. Afterward, Brown gets on the free-throw line with a chance to give the Nuggets a lead and he does by making both, although the second sort of rattled its way down. 2.20am BST Nuggets 33-37 Heat, 7:01, 2nd quarter Oh that’s the Caleb Martin we saw against Miami, he hits a three-pointer. Denver retakes the lead with a Braun layup. Martin hits another three-pointer and, after a Lowry turnover, Martin goes on a fast break and scores. That’s eight points out of nowhere for Martin the microwave. 2.18am BST Nuggets 31-29 Heat, 8:31, 2nd quarter Vincent gets called for a foul, Murray draws it for Denver. And then he gets called for another one? The second one is legit, not so much the first. In any case, he’s sitting here. Of course, Denver takes advantage. Christian Braun unties things with a dunk. 2.15am BST Nuggets 29-29 Heat, 8:59, 2nd quarter Martin finds Adebayo for a dunk. Adebayo hits a jumper and it is now a… tie game because I accidentally handed the Nuggets an additional point somewhere along the way and they have scored 29 and not 30. Denver takes a timeout while I quickly search online for remedial math refresher.

He makes one of two. Updated at 2.13am BST 2.11am BST Nuggets 29-24 Heat, 10:24, 2nd quarter Green over Lowry for a tough layup.

Three more quarters to go, at the very least. 2.05am BST Nuggets 24-24 Heat, end of the 1st quarter The benches are out for the end of the quarter here. Old man Jeff Green (who I must remember is younger than me) makes a layup for the Nuggets but the Heat’s Kyle Lowry scores right before the end of the first quarter and after all that we’re back to where we started. 2.04am BST Nuggets 22-22 Heat, 1:37, 1st quarter Make it two consecutive made baskets for Butler. It feels like he knows that he’s going to have to step up here in this game. 2.03am BST Nuggets 22-20 Heat, 1:37, 1st quarter Butler cuts it down to a two-point Nuggets lead. It must be the diamonds. 2.02am BST Nuggets 22-18 Heat, 2:00, 1st quarter Butler and Jokić, the two teams’ respective MVPs, trade baskets. 2.01am BST Jimmy Butler warming up with diamond earrings on \uD83D\uDC8E♥️\uD83C\uDFC0\uD83D\uDD25 — Anna F Peppard, PhD (@peppard_anna) June 8, 2023 Sometimes I get so wrapped up in the basketball side of things that I lose sight of the most fun details about this game. 1.59am BST Jokić and Murray both have eight points in the first to lead all scorers. If both of them are scoring, rather than just one of them, the Nuggets become very difficult to beat. 1.57am BST Nuggets 20-16 Heat, 2:54, 1st quarter Denver’s Aaron Gordon with a layup. The Heat are cold while the Nuggets’ offense is heating up. After Miami’s Cody Zeller gets called for a foul, the Nuggets take a timeout. 1.55am BST Nuggets 18-16 Heat, 3:41, 1st quarter Strus misses a long one, he’s a streaky guy. Jokić is not, he scores on the next possession. 1.54am BST Nuggets 16-16 Heat, 4:51, 1st quarter Gabe Vincent gets fouled on a three-point attempt, never a good thing for an opposing defense. He makes 2-out-of-3, so it’s not the worst-case scenario for Denver but it’s a tied game again. 1.52am BST Nuggets 16-14 Heat, 4:51, 1st quarter Bam Adebayo gets called with a foul, there are no shots on the play, but Jokić scores on the possession and the Nuggets have their first lead of the game. 1.51am BST Nuggets 14-14 Heat, 5:31, 1st quarter After a scoring splurge to start the game, we have a few scoreless possessions here before Jokić scores to tie the game. 1.48am BST Nuggets 12-14 Heat, 6:24, 1st quarter Michael Porter Jr scores a layup and, despite the fact that Miami is playing much better than Denver, it’s just a two-point lead. Miami calls a timeout, a wise one from this writer’s perspective. 1.45am BST Nuggets 10-14 Heat, 7:11, 1st quarter The first foul, unsurprisingly is on Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, which puts Butler on the free-throw line. He makes both. 1.44am BST Nuggets 10-12 Heat, 7:27, 1st quarter Murray already looks like he’s going to have a better game than his rough Game 2, knocking down his third shot of the game. Next, Max Strus (an assist machine early on) finds Vincent for another Heat basket. The, Murray scores again. Updated at 1.46am BST 1.43am BST Nuggets 6-9 Heat, 8:43, 1st quarter Jimmy Butler drives to the basket and lays one in. Nikola Jokić responds for Denver. Not a defensive masterclass so far.

Game 3 has officially tipped off! 1.34am BST I am not alone in my prediction: Well, I do agree with @HunterFelt of the Guardian's live commentary that @nuggets won't allow a repetition of Game #2's last quarter. They are smart enough to learn from their previous mistakes and will be ready to acquit themselves in Miami, #HeatCulture or not.

First, I said that the Nuggets would win Game 1 fairly easily and then I thought that the Heat would stun the world by doing everything in their power to win a tight Game 2. So far, so good. I’ve honestly been dreading Game 3 because I know that this trend can’t continue. However, tradition demands that I put my reputation on the line once again. Game 3? It feels like Denver and head coach Michael Malone have had enough time to figure out what went horribly wrong for them in the fourth quarter against Miami on Sunday. In “Star Trek,” the Borg are vulnerable to a novel form of attack on the first attempt but future attempts to defeat them in the same manner prove, well, “futile.” I feel that the Nuggets are basically the Basketball Borg. So, look for them to regain control of the series and make it 2-1. It won’t be a blowout, but it won’t be extremely suspenseful down the stretch. Do you agree? Do you think I’m underestimating the Miami Heat? You can send your thoughts to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com or tweet @HunterFelt and we’ll share your predictions with the world. 1.16am BST Nikola and the Dream of Horses Earlier in the postseason, My Improv Teacher asked a question on Twitter that led me down an unexpected rabbit hole: Relatedly, is horses the funniest hobby an NBA star can have https://t.co/kfe9qg3boF — lil pom poko jerk (@rajandelman) May 17, 2023 By his all-business on-the-court demeanor, you might think that Nikola Jokić leads a rather quiet life off of it. Apparently not! When he won his second straight MVP award, he happened to be riding behind his horse in a two-wheeled cart back in his home court of Serbia. He is, it turns out, the biggest horse guy in the NBA. Possibly literally! 1.08am BST Tyler Herro Bad news for the Heat, who were hoping to get Tyler Herro, one of their most dangerous shooters, for Game 3. According to Adrian Wojnarowski, he is still recovering from hand surgery so it’s looking like Game 4 will be the earliest possible return date. 1.06am BST Four minutes into the ABC pregame broadcast and Stephen A. Smith has already attacked Boston Celtics duo Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum even though, last I checked (and I’d love to be wrong) they were eliminated last round. 1.03am BST Chris Paul Meanwhile, NBA news doesn’t stop just because it’s the finals. Earlier today came reports that the Phoenix Suns are considering moving on from Chris Paul’s current contract. Sources: The Suns and Chris Paul are exploring multiple options, including a trade, stretching his contract, or waiving and re-signing him in free agency. Phoenix expected to discuss trades ahead of Paul’s June 28 contract date. Story at @TheAthletic:https://t.co/5EwV2pFLZ6 — Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) June 7, 2023 Initial reports suggested that it would be a straight-up waiving, but the Athletic’s Shams Charania suggests that the Suns could trade the HOF point guard, stretch his contract to reduce his salary cap hit or waive and re-sign him (assuming he passes through waivers). If he is on the move, expect contenders to seek the veteran’s services if the price is right. 12.57am BST Preamble Hello, first of all, I hope that any readers who happen to be affected by the North American wildfires and the rapidly spreading smoke are safe and doing okay. While the NBA finals will be unaffected, the wildfire smoke is wreaking havoc around the sports world. Now, let us turn to the task at hand. There is good news for those of us who love drama: the NBA finals look like an actual series! After the Denver Nuggets dismantled the Miami Heat in Game 1 of the NBA finals, there was a sense that this would end up being one of these brief, unmemorable series. Well, as has been happening all postseason long, the Heat defied expectations. With their 111-108 win, they became the first team to beat the Nuggets at home in the playoffs. Now, the series has traveled back to Miami tied 1-1, with the Nuggets suddenly playing without home-court advantage. So, what are we to expect now? Well, it depends on whether the Nuggets make an adjustment to the Heat’s Game 2 adjustment. On Sunday, the Heat’s defense forced Nikola Jokić to become a scorer to disrupt the type of team basketball that has been the key to Denver’s success all season long. Now, it only barely worked: Jokić torched Miami for 41 points and the team was a made three-pointer away from forcing overtime. Still, the Heat came away with the W. So, as it usually does, Game 3 is going to tell us a lot about both teams and the state of the series. If you want to comment on the finals or the state of the basketball world in general, this is the perfect opportunity, so send us your thoughts or questions either via email (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com or tweet them (to @HunterFelt) and we’ll incorporate them throughout today’s blog.

The Queensland government on Thursday released the August 2021 review of the national fire ant eradication program, which warned pre-existing measures and funding “will not be able to eradicate or contain” the red fire ant outbreak in Brisbane and surrounds. “In view of the outcomes of the program to date and the current risks of spread, a major change of plan will be needed for any possibility of long term eradication and even for continued mitigation,” the review said. The review uses the word “urgent” 18 times. But since receiving the 2021 report, authorities have not yet publicly committed to a pivot in strategy, or to one of three options the reviewers set out for an intergovernmental steering committee. In that time, fire ants have continued to spread in south-east Queensland, and recent finds on the Gold Coast have raised concerns the pests are moving quickly towards New South Wales. Related: March of the fire ants could reach Sydney’s outskirts by 2035, costing economy up to $1.2bn a year The recommended option is to spend up to $300m a year to eradicate the outbreak of red fire ants before the 2032 Brisbane Olympics. The other options are to “contain and suppress” the current outbreak to south-east Queensland, or to wind down the eradication program. A wind-down would allow fire ants to become established, as they have in parts of the US. The ants are described as a “social menace”, swarm aggressively and inflict a sting that can itch and burn for an hour. In rare cases, people have died from allergic relations. The review said the uncontrolled spread of red fire ants would have an economic impact of up to $2bn a year. The Invasive Species Council said it had campaigned for the release of the report, and that it “reveals Australia’s inadequate response to fire ants”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “‘Fire ants are an inferno – we need to treat it like the emergency that it is,” Reece Pianta, the council’s fire ant campaigner, said. “The choice is stark. Australia cannot afford to live with a fire ant future, but we are not investing anywhere near enough to prevent it from happening. “Our governments need to pay the fire ant eradication bill now while we can still afford it.” Related: Ryegrass, fire ants and feral cats: major Australian study identifies costliest pests in past 60 years Ashley Bacon, program executive from the National Fire Ant Eradication Program, said a new response plan would be put forward to federal and state agriculture ministers and that “eradication is still the goal”. Addressing questions about whether authorities had dropped the ball in not acting with more urgency to step-up eradication efforts, Bacon said tireless work had been done over the past 18 months. “In addition to that we’ve increased our engagement with community,” he said. “These efforts have resulted in fire ants remaining in south-east Queensland, which the report clearly states wouldn’t be possible [without the program].” The review makes several recommendations, including more aggressive eradication efforts. It said the Queensland government should expand its biosecurity zone to the NSW border and west to the Great Dividing Range, and “urgently scale up communications, engagement and compliance activities throughout the expanded zone”.","Id":"environment/2023/jun/08/australia-warned-fire-ant-outbreak-required-urgent-measures-nearly-two-years-ago","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webTitle":"Australia warned fire ant outbreak required ‘urgent’ measures nearly two years ago","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/australia-warned-fire-ant-outbreak-required-urgent-measures-nearly-two-years-ago","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jun/08/australia-warned-fire-ant-outbreak-required-urgent-measures-nearly-two-years-ago","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":554,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T03:14:19Z","id":"environment/2023/jun/08/australia-warned-fire-ant-outbreak-required-urgent-measures-nearly-two-years-ago","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Brothers, breadwinners, fathers: the lives lost in India’s train disaster","body":"Stretching 40,000 miles, India’s train lines are often described as the pulsing arteries of the country, carrying life, work and opportunity from the icy upper reaches of the Himalayas to the coconut groves of the south. Though hundreds of small regional airports have cropped up and domestic air travel has boomed, the train is the only affordable option to traverse the country that is almost the size of Europe for the majority of its 1.4 billion people. Many of the 1,250 passengers onboard the Coromandel Express last Friday were facing a long and arduous journey. The train began at Shalimar, in the eastern state of West Bengal and was due to travel more than 1,000 miles to its final destination of Chennai, in Tamil Nadu state in the southern tip of India. It would take more than 32 hours – more if the typical delays slowed things down. Yet many of those who got onboard that day felt they had little choice. Many were migrant workers and labourers, often living below the poverty line, who were travelling to the more prosperous regions of southern India in search of work. According to a 2017 survey, there are more than 60 million migrant workers in India who have crossed state borders for employment. The wreckage of rail coaches in Bahanaga village. Photograph: Abhishek Chinnappa/Getty Images As a result, the busiest carriages on the Coromandel Express were the “general class” carriages, where for the cost of 600 rupees (£6), passengers could board the train without a seat reservation. Here they would endure hot and claustrophobic conditions, squashed in tightly next to each other or sitting on the floor as they snatched some moments of sleep. Yet the train would never reach Chennai. As the Coromandel Express switched tracks as it passed by Bahanaga Bazar station in the state of Odisha, reportedly due to an incorrect green signal, the train collided into a stationary freight train laden with iron ore. Several carriages from the train were thrown into the air with the force of the collision, with the “general class” carriages among the worst affected. By Wednesday, more than 80 bodies, many so badly mutilated they were beyond recognition, had still not been identified or claimed, and doctors struggled to find ice and cold storage for them. Relatives also struggled to locate and identify their loved ones. Six days after the incident, the death toll stood at 288. Here are some of their stories. Asma-Un-Sheikh, 28 Asma-Un-Sheikh and 10 other men from his village were heading to Chennai, where they planned to work as stone masons for the next six months. Photograph: Supplied Asma-Un-Sheikh hugged his sons, aged one and four, on Friday morning and said goodbye to his wife, Mumtaz Bibi, leaving with the promise of bringing her a couple of silk saris on his return. By 9am, Sheikh joined a group of 10 other men from his village of Madhubanpur, which is surrounded by lush rice paddy fields, about 60 miles north of Kolkata in West Bengal, and hopped on a bus. The men loaded their bags on the top of the bus and took their seats, carefully clutching their tiffin boxes freshly packed with home-cooked food for the journey. Sheikh and the group were heading to Chennai, where they planned to work as stone masons for the next six months, as was common among the men of Madhubanpur. They could work for half the year earning far higher wages in Chennai, then return home to harvest their fields. “We have hardly any work here,” said Ghulam Mustafa, 36, Sheikh’s elder brother. “A mason gets paid 400 to 500 rupees (£4-5) a day, while in southern India one gets paid more than double for the same work, and a lot of work is available.” Mustafa said the journey was often torturous. “We cannot spend thousands of rupees to travel in a plane,” he said. “In this scorching heat, it literally feels like hell in a general coach, where you cannot even spread your legs. But that is what poverty does. I wish we had options.” Last Friday, after travelling three hours on two more buses, the men boarded the Coromandel Express at Shalimar railway station, which departed right on time at 3:20pm. At about 6:30pm, Sheikh had called his wife to let her know they were on the way. “They were preparing to eat dinner,” said Bibi. “I had packed chapatis and sabzi [vegetables] in the tiffin. He told me that it was very crowded in the train. But at around 7pm, minutes after he had hung up the phone, the collision happened and their carriage derailed with catastrophic consequences. No one in Sheikh’s group survived. Shams-ul-Huda, who died in the accident, leaves behind a five-year-old girl and a two-year-old boy. Photograph: Supplied When the news of the accident reached the village later in the night, there was panic. “Their phones were not working,” said Bibi. “We started praying for their safety for the entire night and some men from villages rushed to the accident spot.” It took relatives of the 11 people more than two days to identify their bodies and only two dead bodies have been sent home so far. Most of the men were married with children and were supporting extended families that have been left in a precarious situation. “I will have to now take care of two families,” said Noor-Ul-Hood, whose 28-year-old brother Shams-ul-Huda died in the accident, leaving behind a five-year-old girl and a two-year-old boy. “I do not know how I will be able to manage.” Mathilal Sabar, 42, and Jathilal Sabar, 32 Mathilal Sabar.

They were married to two brothers, Mathilal Sabar and Jathilal Sabar, who were both killed in the collision. “Our breadwinners have been killed, we do not know how to face this situation,” said Hemani. “We have lost our husbands, who is responsible for their life?” Jathilal Sabar.

Every year, they would travel south for seven to nine months, to find employment on construction sites. It was tough, backbreaking work in the burning southern Indian sun but meant their families had an income they were unable to find close to home. Then they could return home for at least a couple of months with their families. Their wives would take care of the agricultural land in their absence. “But we will have to do everything on our own now,” said Basukhi. Hemani worried that her children would have to be taken out of school and put into employment sooner so they could all survive. “Our husbands were working hard so that our kids receive education, they do good in their lives and they do not have to travel in cramped trains in search of work like their fathers,” she said. Mansas Maiti, 23 Mansas Maiti was over the moon when he told his brother last week about the job offer he had received. Maiti, a recent college graduate, was to work as an accountant in a small company in Chennai, his first proper job. Maiti grew up in a poverty-stricken family in West Champaran district in India’s poorest state of Bihar, but he was smart and had ambitions. His family had to take a loan to support his education but he had planned repay it from his salary. “We were happy for him and thought that now our family can prosper a bit,” said Tapan Kumar, 24, Maiti’s brother, who works as a labourer. But having boarded the Coromandel Express full of hope, Maiti would never make it to Chennai. It took his brother two days to locate his body among the piles of the dead and then about 30 hours to drive him home in an ambulance. “Every time I look at his dead body, I want to jump out of the ambulance. I am just shattered. I don’t know what to say,” said Kumar. Breaking down in tears, Kumar said: “My brother had big dreams. He wanted to earn money, help family and live a decent life. He had worked hard for that, he was the first person in our family to graduate.” To reach Odisha to identify the dead body of his brother, Kumar spent all his savings on the plane ticket, the first time he had taken a flight. “I knew I would one day get to board a plane to visit my brother,” said Kumar. “But I did not know it would be like this.”","Id":"world/2023/jun/08/brothers-breadwinners-fathers-the-lives-lost-in-indias-train-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Brothers, breadwinners, fathers: the lives lost in India’s train disaster ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/brothers-breadwinners-fathers-the-lives-lost-in-indias-train-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/08/brothers-breadwinners-fathers-the-lives-lost-in-indias-train-disaster","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":1397,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T03:00:00Z","id":"world/2023/jun/08/brothers-breadwinners-fathers-the-lives-lost-in-indias-train-disaster","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Dry run: Australia’s ski season kicks off without snow and El Niño may be to blame","body":"Australia’s ski season will start with no skiing, no snowboarding, no snow – and a drying El Niño may be to blame. Due to a “lack of snow,” Thredbo Resort has closed its mountain to skiing and snowboarding this long weekend, a spokesperson said – just as it kicks off its official winter season. The Bureau of Meteorology placed Australia on “El Niño alert” this week. “If El Nino does develop, it brings an enhanced risk of a drier and warmer winter compared to normal,” senior BOM meteorologist, Angus Hines, said. There is now a 70% chance of the climate system developing before the end of this year – roughly three times the normal chance for the first time since 2016. There were several cold outbreaks in May, which brought below average temperatures and dustings of snow to Thredbo and alpine areas. But snow in May is not always a good indicator of the snow season to come, Hines said. Warm and rainy conditions in recent days have melted much of that snow away. Related: Bureau of Meteorology puts Australia on ‘El Niño alert’ Many alpine regions had seen significant snowfall in late May last year, but Hines said it is not uncommon to have little snow in early June. “Most years the alpine areas don’t begin to build their snow base until June and sometimes later.” A brief surge of showers is forecast for Friday, which could bring a dusting of snow to areas above 1,400m, but “no significant snow is expected”. There is also no snow forecast through the long weekend. From next Tuesday, the next frontal system will move overhead. “Although at this stage, that system doesn’t look like it will bring much or any snowfall,” Hines said. The long-term winter forecast is warmer and drier than average across the alpines, and much of Australia, though Hines said there will still be cold and snowy outbreaks from time to time through the winter months. A Thredbo spokesperson has hope nonetheless: “There is promising snowfall and snowmaking conditions in the seven-day forecast. “We can’t wait to deliver skiing and snowboarding as soon as conditions allow.”","Id":"environment/2023/jun/08/australia-ski-season-no-snow-skiing-snowboarding-resorts-closed-warm-weather","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webTitle":"Dry run: Australia’s ski season kicks off without snow and El Niño may be to blame","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/australia-ski-season-no-snow-skiing-snowboarding-resorts-closed-warm-weather","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jun/08/australia-ski-season-no-snow-skiing-snowboarding-resorts-closed-warm-weather","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":344,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T02:59:10Z","id":"environment/2023/jun/08/australia-ski-season-no-snow-skiing-snowboarding-resorts-closed-warm-weather","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Australian Ballet dancers begin industrial action over pay dispute: ‘They’re living on tuna and rice’","body":"Negotiations between the Australian Ballet’s management and its employees have broken down and the dancers haven’t ruled out striking if a dispute over pay cannot be resolved. Negotiations on a new EBA began last September and last week the dancers embarked on protected industrial action with a social media campaign through their union, the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance. The sticking point is management’s refusal to maintain a clause in the dancers’ contract that guarantees pay will keep pace with inflation, a guarantee that has been in place for more than 20 years, to recognise dancers’ comparatively short career span. Two Australian Ballet dancers who spoke to Guardian Australia said the consumer price index (CPI) guarantee in their agreement had never had to be invoked before. But over the last 12 months, with the RBA raising the cash rate 12 times in almost as many months, taking it to 4.1% on Tuesday, dancers say they are facing mounting financial hardship, as they continue to recover from a pay cut and then a pay freeze during the pandemic. Related: The Australian Ballet prepares for Romeo and Juliet – in pictures “We had to dip into our savings and now with inflation, the cost of living is going up so high and many of us have no savings left,” one dancer said. “We’ve had dancers who’ve had to cancel their health insurance. We have dancers who can’t afford groceries, they’re living off tuna and rice … it’s not ideal in a profession where you use your body so much and you’re expected to perform at an elite level.” When Covid hit in 2020, the Australian Ballet cut its dancers’ wages by 20% and then by 50% to reflect a drastically reduced workload. The company drew on the federal government’s JobKeeper scheme to pay workers. In 2021 the dancers returned to full pay, but agreed to a pay freeze for one year. In February this year the dancers received a 4.3% “catch-up” pay rise to meet the obligations of the CPI clause, after receiving just 2.5% in 2022 when inflation peaked at over 7%. An offer of a 1% pay rise for 2023 has been rejected by the dancers. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The Australian Ballet’s executive director, Lissa Twomey, said in a statement the wage offer put to the company’s dancers would still see them receive a 5.3% increase over what they were paid in 2022. “It is higher than wage offers or agreements in peer dance organisations, and it comes at a time of significant economic challenges for our company, most notably the impending closure of our home theatre in Melbourne from 2024 to 2026,” she said. Today, a dancer at entry level in the company earns just over $69,000. A senior artist earns just under $100,000. They typically work six days a week and spend about five months of the year touring. The average age of retirement for a ballet dancer is about 35. With 60% of the company’s revenue drawn from ticket sales and theatres closing down from March 2020, the Australian Ballet managed to contain its losses in the first year of the pandemic to just $2.4m – largely thanks to patrons donating about $3m to the company by opting to forgo ticket refunds for the 2020 season. By the time the lockdowns ended in 2021, the company had drawn down $8.5m from its reserves and a commercial loan facility. Another Australian Ballet employee told Guardian Australia they feel let down by management after the dancers made financial sacrifices during Covid. “There is a real sense of pride in [the dancers’] work, and they have such a deep admiration for the company and for this career,” he said. Related: ‘Make it more noisy’: the young dancer shaking up Australian ballet “The dancers are very aware and considerate of the company’s financial position, but they don’t believe that what they’re asking for is an exorbitant request. Financial security is important.” The Australian Ballet is scheduled to open a new program Arts Centre Melbourne on 16 June. In August the company will tour to the Royal Opera House in London, as part of its 60th anniversary celebrations. Twomey said the company had held a series of good faith bargaining meetings over the past nine months. Agreements had been reached in areas including performance scheduling, time and fatigue management, and live streaming royalty arrangements for dancers. “Over the course of previous enterprise agreements our dancers often received wage rises in excess of CPI increases,” Twomey said. “With the expiration of the most recent agreement, we are seeking to ensure there is greater certainty for all parties moving forward, particularly in the context of our underlying financial position post-Covid, the closure of our home theatre and the financial uncertainty ahead.” Related: Young Australians now the least likely to attend arts events as cost of living bites The MEAA’s equity director, Michelle Rae, said 91% of AB dancers voted in favour of a recent protected action ballot overseen by the Fair Work Commission. “This [CPI] lifeline in the agreement has been particularly important given the current cost of living crisis and financial sacrifices dancers made to support the company during the Covid pandemic in 2020-21,” Rae said in a statement, adding the union had collected “a staggering number of stories” from dancers that painted a “bleak picture” of their financial wellbeing. “Management still refuses to provide workable solutions.” Protected industrial action was an absolute last resort, she said.","Id":"culture/2023/jun/08/australian-ballet-dancers-begin-industrial-action-over-pay-dispute-theyre-living-on-tuna-and-rice","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Australian Ballet dancers begin industrial action over pay dispute: ‘They’re living on tuna and rice’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/08/australian-ballet-dancers-begin-industrial-action-over-pay-dispute-theyre-living-on-tuna-and-rice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2023/jun/08/australian-ballet-dancers-begin-industrial-action-over-pay-dispute-theyre-living-on-tuna-and-rice","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts","wordcount":892,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T02:38:27Z","id":"culture/2023/jun/08/australian-ballet-dancers-begin-industrial-action-over-pay-dispute-theyre-living-on-tuna-and-rice","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Australia’s capital cities record largest ever annual rent increases as housing crisis worsens","body":"Australian capital cities have once again recorded their strongest ever annual rent increases, amid a rapidly worsening housing crisis.

Overall, house rents in capital cities increased 0.9% in May, while unit rent increased 1.4%. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Sydney is still the most expensive city to rent in, seeing a monthly increase of 1.2% to an average of $723 a week across the city. Coming in second was Canberra, which saw a decline of 0.4%, with median rent $671, followed by Brisbane at $609, a 0.6% increase. Melbourne saw the steepest jump in median rent – an increase of 1.4% in the past month to $543, which is still below the median rent in Perth ($594) and Darwin ($596). The national average rent is now $583 a week, increasing 0.8% in the past month and 9.9% in the past year. The national average rent for a house is $594 and $558 for a unit. The Sydney suburbs of Haymarket, Wolli Creek and Zetland saw the largest annual increase in rent across suburbs nationally, with rent increasing by 30% in the past year. But CoreLogic economist Kaytlin Ezzy said there had been some slowdown, with the rate of national rent growth slightly below the marks reached in April and March. She said annual trends had also dipped to below double digits for the first time in months, attributing it to a slowdown in regional markets, where rent increased only 0.3% in the past month. “Regional rental growth has slowed dramatically from a year ago while capital city rents were up 1.0% in May. “When you break that figure down further by property type, we can see the unit sector is under the greatest pressure, with rents increasing at a faster rate than houses due to their relative affordability,” she said. Sydney recorded declines in 38 markets, mostly on the Central Coast, while Melbourne recorded declines in only four suburbs, and Brisbane only one. Ezzy said while some suburbs had also recorded declines in the past year, the majority were located in regional areas or Canberra, where rental stock had increased enough to affect the market. “In the past year we’ve seen rents increase in every capital and rest of state region except for Canberra where there’s been a –1.9% decline,” she said. “Canberra was previously the country’s most expensive rental city until Sydney overtook it in December. “The softening rental conditions in the ACT is likely due to there being more stock on the market. Canberra’s vacancy rate has increased from 0.7% in March 2022 to 2.2%, putting it second behind Hobart (2.7%). “More stock means tenants have more choice and potentially more power when negotiating their rent,” she added.","Id":"australia-news/2023/jun/08/australia-capital-cities-record-largest-ever-annual-rent-increases-housing-rental-crisis-worsens","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Australia’s capital cities record largest ever annual rent increases as housing crisis worsens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/08/australia-capital-cities-record-largest-ever-annual-rent-increases-housing-rental-crisis-worsens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jun/08/australia-capital-cities-record-largest-ever-annual-rent-increases-housing-rental-crisis-worsens","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":576,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T02:22:11Z","id":"australia-news/2023/jun/08/australia-capital-cities-record-largest-ever-annual-rent-increases-housing-rental-crisis-worsens","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Tens of millions under air quality alerts in US as Canada fire smoke drifts south","body":"Tens of millions of people in the US were under air quality alerts on Wednesday, as smoke from Canadian wildfires drifted south, turning the sky in some of the country’s biggest cities a murky brown and saturating the air with harmful pollution. States across the east, including New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut, issued air quality alerts, with officials recommending that people limit outdoor activity. Interactive In New York City, where conditions were expected to deteriorate further through the day, residents were urged to limit their time outdoors, as public schools canceled outdoor activities. Smoke from wildfires in Canada has been moving south into the US since May. Hundreds of fires are burning in Canada, from the western provinces to Nova Scotia and Quebec in the east, where there are more than 150 active fires in a particularly fierce start to the summer season. New York City had the worst air quality of any big city in the world on Wednesday, according to IQAir. Second worst was Lahore, Pakistan, while the next worst major US city, Detroit, Michigan, came in at 13th. Delhi, India, which consistently ranks among the worst cities for air pollution, was sixth worst. The smell of smoke was detectable in New York on Tuesday evening as the sky turned orange-brown and visibility shrank before sunset. The smell persisted on Wednesday, and an air quality advisory was expected to remain in place until Wednesday night in much of central and eastern New York state. In New York City, schools canceled all outdoor events and residents were encouraged to wear face masks, which many had shed as the coronavirus pandemic waned. “We recommend all New Yorkers limit outdoor activity to the greatest extent possible,” the mayor, Eric Adams, said. “Those with pre-existing respiratory problems, like heart or breathing problems, as well as children and older adults, may be especially sensitive and should stay indoors at this time.” Adams said air conditions were expected to deteriorate throughout Wednesday afternoon and evening. Almost the entire state of New Jersey was under an air quality alert, while hazy conditions and smoke from the wildfires were reported across the Great Lakes region from Cleveland, Ohio, to Buffalo, New York. The smoke had drifted as far south as South Carolina, where officials recommended that people keep doors and windows closed. A woman looks at the Manhattan skyline engulfed in haze on 7 June. Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA In Philadelphia, the smell of smoke prompted a spate of 911 calls on Tuesday night, 6ABC reported, as residents were asked to avoid going outdoors as much as possible. Air-quality alerts are triggered by a number of factors, including the detection of fine-particle pollution – known as “PM 2.5” – which can irritate the lungs. “We have defenses in our upper airway to trap larger particles and prevent them from getting down into the lungs. These are sort of the right size to get past those defenses,” Dr David Hill, a pulmonologist in Waterbury, Connecticut, and a member of the American Lung Association’s national board of directors, told the Associated Press. “When those particles get down into the respiratory space, they cause the body to have an inflammatory reaction to them.” The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said hazy skies, reduced visibility and the odor of burning wood are likely, and that the smoke will linger for a few days in northern states. “It’s not unusual for us to get fire smoke in our area. It’s very typical in terms of north-west Canada,” Darren Austin, a meteorologist and senior air quality specialist with the Rhode Island department of environmental management, told the AP. But, usually, the smoke has been aloft and hasn’t affected people’s health, Austin said. Experts, and some political leaders were highlighting links between the wildfires and the climate crisis. A 2021 study supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association found that climate change has been the main driver of the increase in hot, dry fire weather in the western US. By 2090, global wildfires are expected to increase in intensity by up to 57% thanks to climate change, a United Nations report warned last year.","Id":"environment/2023/jun/07/new-york-air-quality-alerts","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webTitle":" Tens of millions under air quality alerts in US as Canada fire smoke drifts south","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/07/new-york-air-quality-alerts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jun/07/new-york-air-quality-alerts","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":672,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T01:57:33Z","id":"environment/2023/jun/07/new-york-air-quality-alerts","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Albanese government knew ‘sustainable’ Darwin harbour project would be used for gas export, documents show","body":"The federal government knew wharves at the proposed “sustainable” Middle Arm development on Darwin harbour would be used for gas export, documents released under freedom of information show. Briefing materials from the Northern Territory government released to the Environment Centre of the NT have prompted fresh questions about the Albanese government’s $1.5bn stake in the project, which both governments have labelled a sustainable development precinct. Related: Darwin’s ‘sustainable’ Middle Arm development is key to huge fossil fuel projects, documents show The federal minister for infrastructure, Catherine King, has previously said the federal government’s investment in Middle Arm is “not a subsidy for fossil fuels” but rather “an important way of setting up our economy for a sustainable future”. But a conceptual drawing by the NT government that formed part of an incoming minister briefing prepared by the federal infrastructure department before last year’s election shows the gas industry would benefit from the proposed federally funded marine infrastructure. In the drawing, four of five proposed wharves are labelled for shipping of products including LNG (liquefied natural gas), methanol, ethylene, ammonia and “clean petroleum”. The remaining wharf is labelled “hydrogen”. The drawing was for what the NT government described as a “balanced scenario” it was pursuing at Middle Arm, which would feature gas, petrochemicals, blue and green hydrogen, critical minerals and carbon capture and storage. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Two other possible scenarios were prepared, a “future fuels” scenario focused on gas and hydrogen and a “downstream” scenario focused on petrochemicals. A separate video describes the project as a “globally unique green energy hub” and illustrates plans to link Middle Arm with Sun Cable’s proposed solar farm and the Beetaloo gas basin south of Katherine. It includes a list of companies that could feature at the Middle Arm site including Tamboran Resources (one of the main companies operating in the Beetaloo), Fortescue Future Industries (Fortescue Metals Group’s clean energy arm), Sun Cable and the critical minerals company TNG, which has since rebranded as Tivan. Critics argue the Middle Arm precinct project amounts to ‘fracking infrastructure’. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian The video is undated, but a version was published by the NT government in late 2022 without the list of possible proponents. The Australian Financial Review reported Wednesday afternoon that Tamboran, FFI and Tivan would feature in an imminent announcement by the NT government about the precinct. Guardian Australia revealed last month that a briefing to the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the precinct was seen as a “key enabler” for the export of gas from the Beetaloo basin. Kirsty Howey, the ECNT’s executive director, said the new documents put “beyond doubt” that “everyday Australians are funding a massive fracking export hub in the middle of Darwin harbour to the tune of $1.5bn”. “By directly subsidising fracking infrastructure at Middle Arm, it’s clear the Albanese government is not merely a passive bystander in new gas projects – it’s a partner in them,” she said. “Our governments should be acting urgently to cut emissions, not funding carbon bombs that will speed us towards climate collapse.” A spokeswoman for King said the Middle Arm precinct was “not targeted at one industry over another”. “It offers opportunities for a range of industries including gas, green hydrogen and renewable storage, as well as advanced manufacturing, carbon capture and storage, minerals processing and other land uses,” she said. “This investment into common-use enabling infrastructure will give all potential users, in the market the opportunity to grow and thrive rather than a particular company or industry.” Grant Wilson is the executive chair of Tivan, which has publicly stated it will use the Middle Arm precinct for processing of vanadium for products such as batteries. Wilson said Tivan would make use of the existing infrastructure at Darwin harbour and renewable power to limit its own footprint. He has raised his concerns about the gas focus of the $1.5bn in federal funding and urged the Albanese government to consider redirecting the money to more sustainable uses at the site. Related: How is Australia trying to sell a major gas expansion?

The study, which has federal funding, would be conducted by the gas companies Inpex and Santos, the national science agency CSIRO and the energy consultancy Xodus. The NT’s chief minister, Natasha Fyles, said Middle Arm “will be a sustainable development precinct for both jobs here in the territory for manufacturing” but also for new technologies to supply energy locally and globally. She dismissed suggestions Middle Arm was gas-focused. “There’s a lot of excitement because people can see that this precinct is an opportunity not only for the Northern Territory but an opportunity for Australia and around the world,” she said.","Id":"australia-news/2023/jun/07/albanese-government-knew-sustainable-darwin-harbour-project-would-be-used-for-gas-export-documents-show","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Albanese government knew ‘sustainable’ Darwin harbour project would be used for gas export, documents show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/07/albanese-government-knew-sustainable-darwin-harbour-project-would-be-used-for-gas-export-documents-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jun/07/albanese-government-knew-sustainable-darwin-harbour-project-would-be-used-for-gas-export-documents-show","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":816,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T01:53:28Z","id":"australia-news/2023/jun/07/albanese-government-knew-sustainable-darwin-harbour-project-would-be-used-for-gas-export-documents-show","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Shannen Doherty reveals breast cancer has spread to her brain","body":"Shannen Doherty has revealed that the terminal breast cancer she has been receiving treatment for over several years has now spread to her brain.
