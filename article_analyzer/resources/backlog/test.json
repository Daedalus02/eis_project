[{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Weatherwatch: concerns over climate impact on UK nuclear power sites","body":"Successive governments since the 1980s have had plans for new generations of nuclear power stations sited around the coasts of the United Kingdom. Although the main reason for building them, according to politicians, is to provide a low-carbon form of electricity to combat the climate crisis, no thought seems to have gone into what the climate crisis might do to the nuclear power stations. Prof Andy Blowers, a former government adviser on nuclear waste, points out in the Town and Country Planning Association Journal that the eight sites identified in 2011 as suitable for new stations are the same as those identified half a century earlier, on which the first generation of nuclear power stations were built. The reason the sites were originally chosen was their remoteness, for safety, and their proximity to the sea, for cooling purposes. The latest reasoning is that they would have a better chance of public acceptance because two generations of local people have worked in the industry. The new installations are planned to operate for 60 years and will need another century after closure to cool sufficiently to remove the waste. Blowers, an opponent of the government plans, worries that ministers seem to have taken no account of sea level rise, intense storms and the prospect of flooding at these sites.","Id":"news/2023/may/12/weatherwatch-concerns-over-climate-impact-on-uk-nuclear-power-sites","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: concerns over climate impact on UK nuclear power sites","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/may/12/weatherwatch-concerns-over-climate-impact-on-uk-nuclear-power-sites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2023/may/12/weatherwatch-concerns-over-climate-impact-on-uk-nuclear-power-sites","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":217,"webPublicationDate":"2023-05-12T05:00:47Z","id":"news/2023/may/12/weatherwatch-concerns-over-climate-impact-on-uk-nuclear-power-sites","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"AI should be licensed like medicines or nuclear power, Labour suggests","body":"The UK should bar technology developers from working on advanced artificial intelligence tools unless they have a licence to do so, Labour has said. Ministers should introduce much stricter rules around companies training their AI products on vast datasets of the kind used by OpenAI to build ChatGPT, Lucy Powell, Labour’s digital spokesperson, told the Guardian. Her comments come amid a rethink at the top of government over how to regulate the fast-moving world of AI, with the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, acknowledging it could pose an “existential” threat to humanity. One of the government’s advisers on artificial intelligence also said on Monday that humanity could have only two years before AI is able to outwit people, the latest in a series of stark warnings about the threat posed by the fast-developing technology. Powell said: “My real point of concern is the lack of any regulation of the large language models that can then be applied across a range of AI tools, whether that’s governing how they are built, how they are managed or how they are controlled.” She suggested AI should be licensed in a similar way to medicines or nuclear power, both of which are governed by arms-length governmental bodies. “That is the kind of model we should be thinking about, where you have to have a licence in order to build these models,” she said. “These seem to me to be the good examples of how this can be done.” The UK government published a white paper on AI two months ago, which detailed the opportunities the technology could bring, but said relatively little about how to regulate it. Since then, a range of developments, including advances in ChatGPT and a series of stark warnings from industry insiders, have caused a rethink at the top of government, with ministers now hastily updating their approach. This week Sunak will travel to Washington DC, where he will argue that the UK should be at the forefront of international efforts to write a new set of guidelines to govern the industry. Labour is also rushing to finalise its own policies on advanced technology. Powell, who will give a speech to industry insiders at the TechUK conference in London on 6 June, said she believed the disruption to the UK economy could be as drastic as the deindustrialisation of the 1970s and 1980s. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, is expected to give a speech on the subject during London Tech Week next week. Starmer will hold a shadow cabinet meeting in one of Google’s UK offices next week, giving shadow ministers a chance to speak to some of the company’s top AI executives. Powell said that rather than banning certain technologies, as the EU has done with tools such as facial recognition, she thought the UK should focus on regulating the way in which they are developed. Products such as ChatGPT are built by training algorithms on vast banks of digital information. But experts warn that if those datasets contain biased or discriminatory data, the products themselves can show evidence of those biases. This could have a knock-on effect, for example, on employment practices if AI tools are used to help make hiring and firing decisions. Powell said: “Bias, discrimination, surveillance – this technology can have a lot of unintended consequences.” She argued that by forcing developers to be more open about the data they are using, governments could help mitigate those risks. “This technology is moving so fast that it needs an active, interventionist government approach, rather than a laissez-faire one.” Matt Clifford, the chair of the Advanced Research and Invention Agency, which the government set up last year, said on Monday that AI was evolving much faster than most people realised. He said it could already be used to launch bioweapons or large-scale cyber-attacks, adding that humans could rapidly be surpassed by the technology they had created. Related: AI could outwit humans in two years, says UK government adviser Speaking to TalkTV’s Tom Newton Dunn, Clifford said: “It’s certainly true that if we try and create artificial intelligence that is more intelligent than humans and we don’t know how to control it, then that’s going to create a potential for all sorts of risks now and in the future. So I think there’s lots of different scenarios to worry about but I certainly think it’s right that it should be very high on the policymakers’ agendas.” Asked when that could happen, he added: “No one knows. There are a very broad range of predictions among AI experts. I think two years will be at the very most sort of bullish end of the spectrum.”","Id":"technology/2023/jun/05/ai-could-outwit-humans-in-two-years-says-uk-government-adviser","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webTitle":"AI should be licensed like medicines or nuclear power, Labour suggests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/05/ai-could-outwit-humans-in-two-years-says-uk-government-adviser","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/jun/05/ai-could-outwit-humans-in-two-years-says-uk-government-adviser","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":765,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-05T21:56:15Z","id":"technology/2023/jun/05/ai-could-outwit-humans-in-two-years-says-uk-government-adviser","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Keir Starmer says nuclear power is ‘critical part’ of UK’s energy mix","body":"Keir Starmer has described nuclear power as a “critical part” of the UK’s energy mix and pledged to get stalled projects over the line, as Labour positions itself firmly behind the technology. Before the Labour leader presents his net zero energy policies during a speech in Scotland early next week, the party said it would “push forward” nuclear to boost energy security, cut costs for consumers and create jobs. On Sunday Starmer accused the Conservatives of a “shambolic” failure to open any nuclear power plants during 13 years in power. On Monday he will visit Hinkley Point C in Somerset, one of a number of new plants still not operational despite having been identified in 2009 when Labour was last in power. “My government will lower household energy bills, create jobs and ensure Britain’s energy security. Nuclear is a critical part of the UK’s energy mix,” said Starmer, who claimed Tory failure to approve the new plans had cost 7,000 British jobs. However, another plank of the party’s energy plans came under renewed attack on Sunday from a union that is one of Labour’s biggest donors. Gary Smith, the GMB general secretary, accused the Labour party of being naive over its plans to ban North Sea oil and gas production. Labour has pledged to block all new domestic oil and gas developments if it wins power, proposing instead to invest heavily in renewable sources such as wind and also in nuclear power. The proposals, which Starmer is expected to set out formally on a visit to Scotland this month, will involve not only a ban on new North Sea oil and gas licences but also a pledge that any borrowing for investment should be limited to green schemes. Smith said Labour had “got it wrong” and risked creating “a cliff-edge with oil and gas extraction from the North Sea”. “We are critical friends of the Labour party and I think this is just a lack of intellectual rigour and thinking about where they have got to on oil and gas,” he told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. “They are focusing on what they think is popular rather than doing the proper thinking to understand what is right for the country.” The shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said earlier on the same programme that the existing oil and gas fields in the North Sea would run until 2050 and the party was not talking about turning those off. Starmer’s promise to block new North Sea oil and gas exploration has received the backing of an eclectic range of high-profile groups, including environmental campaigners, trade unions and even the Women’s Institute. The radical pledge is a key plank of Labour’s environmental platform, but has angered business and political leaders in the north-east of Scotland, where the industry is concentrated. Starmer is being urged to stick to the plan in a letter signed by 139 organisations, including the Countryside Charity, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the National Federation of Women’s Institutes. The groups write: “We urge you to stand firm on Labour’s policy of no new oil and gas developments and its significant investment in well-planned, nature-positive renewables and energy efficiency, and to confirm more details on how Labour will support workers to transition from fossil fuels to good quality, secure green jobs during your speech in June.” Shadow ministers confirmed last month that the party intended to ban new domestic oil and gas developments as part of its strategy to achieve zero-carbon power by 2030. Starmer will formally announce the pledge as part of a speech later this month setting out his green agenda in more detail. The plans have drawn fire from Aberdeen-based business leaders and the Tories, with Grant Shapps claiming the policy was an “ideological vendetta against British energy independence” and warning it would put jobs at risk and boost Russia’s global power. Shapps, the energy secretary, is due to make a decision within weeks over whether to approve drilling at the giant Rosebank oilfield off Shetland. Comments from Rishi Sunak – who has said it would be “economically illiterate” not to invest in new UK oil and gas – have been interpreted as a sign that the government is prepared to give it the green light, although there have been warnings that Labour’s green policies could make it less attractive to investors. In an article for the Times, Ryan Crighton, the policy director of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: “If the alternative is importing, at a greater carbon cost, then surely the UK should always favour domestic production, where we can control the regulatory environment.” The high-profile opposition to Labour’s plans has caused concern among environmental groups, with Labour recently having backtracked on a range of other policies, including a pledge to abolish university tuition fees. Starmer is also under pressure from some of his frontbench to change the remit of the party’s £28bn climate fund to allow it to invest in infrastructure projects that are not explicitly green in nature. Tessa Khan, the founder of Uplift, a group that campaigns for the UK to move away from fossil fuels, and which signed the letter, said: “We were disturbed by the way in which Labour’s position to oppose development of new oil and gas field has come under attack in the last week. We wanted to make it clear that it is a core position of the climate sector and more broadly among different sectors in the UK. It’s a mainstream position and backed up by climate science.”","Id":"politics/2023/jun/04/keir-starmer-says-nuclear-power-is-critical-part-of-uks-energy-mix","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Keir Starmer says nuclear power is ‘critical part’ of UK’s energy mix","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/04/keir-starmer-says-nuclear-power-is-critical-part-of-uks-energy-mix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/jun/04/keir-starmer-says-nuclear-power-is-critical-part-of-uks-energy-mix","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":929,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-04T21:30:11Z","id":"politics/2023/jun/04/keir-starmer-says-nuclear-power-is-critical-part-of-uks-energy-mix","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Germany’s last three nuclear power stations to shut this weekend","body":"Germany’s three remaining nuclear power stations will shut down on Saturday, 12 years after the Fukushima disaster in Japan accelerated the country’s exit from atomic energy. The closures mark the conclusion of a stop-start approach to atomic energy and a victory for the country’s vociferous anti-nuclear movement. The facilities shutting are in Emsland, in the northern state of Lower Saxony, the Isar 2 site in Bavaria, and Neckarwestheim, in Baden-Württemberg in the south-west. Related: Germany at a crossroads: what a nuclear power station tells us about its energy dilemma The shutdowns leave a conundrum for energy policymakers attempting to balance growing electricity demand in one of Europe’s industrial superpowers and efforts to decarbonise, against the backdrop of uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine. Germany last year delayed the closure of the three sites – which provided about 6.5% of the country’s electricity in 2022 – after Russia reduced European gas supplies, triggering concerns about a shortage of energy over the winter. The country began phasing out nuclear power more than two decades ago amid a long-fought campaign against the technology, but, in 2010 Angela Merkel, then chancellor, announced an extension to the life of the country’s 17 nuclear plants until 2036 at the latest. This policy was swiftly reversed the following year after an earthquake and tsunami caused the meltdown of reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan, triggering fresh anti-nuclear protests and political resolve to exit the technology. Nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island in the US in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986 had already entrenched the push against nuclear in Germany, which had begun earlier in the 1970s. Germany has switched off 16 reactors since 2003. The final shutdowns have raised questions about security of energy supplies and the outlook for Germany’s carbon emissions. The country plans to close all coal-fired power plants by 2038, with the first round of closures planned in 2030. However, its parliament approved emergency legislation to reopen mothballed coal-fired power plants to aid electricity generation last year. A push to build more terminals to import liquefied natural gas has also been accelerated since the Ukraine war began. Coal accounted for just over 30% of Germany’s electricity generation in 2022, ahead of wind – responsible for 22%, gas-fired generation at 13% and solar at 10%. Biomass, nuclear and hydroelectric power made up the bulk of the remainder. The thinktank Ember has estimated that Germany and Poland will be the EU’s two largest producers of coal-fired electricity in 2030, responsible for more than half of EU power sector emissions by that point. Advocates of nuclear power argue that it provides a low-carbon, reliable alternative to fossil fuels for electricity generation. Critics say new projects are costly, frequently delayed and present environmental concerns over the disposal of nuclear waste. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the UK’s Nuclear Industry Association, said the phaseout would worsen carbon emissions and “for a country supposedly renowned for its logical and evidence-driven approach is environmentally damaging, economically illiterate and deeply irresponsible”. He added: “At a time of heightened concern about energy security, Germany will be abandoning assets that can displace 34bn cubic metres of gas a year.” But Tom Burke, chair of the thinktank E3G, played down fears over energy security, and said a mild winter and high levels of gas storage in Europe meant concerns about power supplies next winter had eased. He said Germany’s renewables industry was growing and that improving grid connections and battery storage across the country would be key to moving the country’s energy system away from fossil fuels. “The coal is mainly being burnt for social and economic reasons, making sure the industry doesn’t shut down all at once,” said Burke. “You cannot have a technology transformation without a social transformation.” Germany’s abandonment of nuclear power is in contrast to the stated ambitions of the UK government, which last month kickstarted a fresh push into nuclear. Ministers have set up a delivery body for new nuclear projects and are running a competition for small nuclear reactors. However, progress on developing two existing large projects, Sizewell C in Suffolk and Hinkley Point C in Somerset, has been slow, with the latter delayed and overbudget.","Id":"environment/2023/apr/15/germany-last-three-nuclear-power-stations-to-shut-this-weekend","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webTitle":"Germany’s last three nuclear power stations to shut this weekend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/15/germany-last-three-nuclear-power-stations-to-shut-this-weekend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/apr/15/germany-last-three-nuclear-power-stations-to-shut-this-weekend","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":682,"webPublicationDate":"2023-04-15T06:00:35Z","id":"environment/2023/apr/15/germany-last-three-nuclear-power-stations-to-shut-this-weekend","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Leaks from Minnesota nuclear power plant raise safety fears across US","body":"In December, Janica Jammes started a microgreens business in the basement of her home in Big Lake, Minnesota, just across the river from Xcel Energy’s nuclear plant in Monticello. At least once each day, she uses water from her well to nourish the plant trays. She delivers her product to customers within a 10-mile radius and says the business has been a success. But now she worries that her water could be contaminated by a leak of about 400,000 gallons of radioactive water that occurred in November at the plant, which is about 40 miles north-west of Minneapolis. Moreover, Jammes is upset that the company did not alert the public about the leak until March – and then detected a second leak, which the company described as smaller than the first one. “We don’t know for sure if” side-effects from the leaks “will happen or when anything will happen but just the lack of transparency is very concerning”, said Jammes, a 36-year-old mother of four. While Xcel Energy representatives have said the leaks did not affect local drinking water or pose a safety threat to residents, residents such as Jammes want more answers from the company. Independent nuclear energy experts agree that the company should have been more transparent, but they say that based on reports from state and federal agencies, they also do not think the leaks pose a health risk to residents or that the incidents will serve as a significant setback to efforts to promote the carbon-free power source in the US. “This leak, even though it was contained and poses no danger”, according to the official reports, “it should be used as some sort of wake-up call”, said Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor who specializes in nuclear safety at the University of Southern California. While some scientists see increasing nuclear energy as a crucial, safe way to reducing carbon emissions and increasing the country’s energy independence, the disasters at the Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and Fukushima nuclear power plants continue to cause fears of the power source. “Nuclear is the only clean energy sector that has the capacity to” transition away from fossil fuels “on a large scale”, said Charlyne Smith, a senior nuclear energy analyst at the Breakthrough Institute, an energy thinktank. “It is an industry that is highly scrutinized compared to other industries, and I think the Nuclear Regulatory Commission does a really good job at ensuring that safety is something that is practiced in the industry.” Patrick Flowers of Xcel Energy speaks to the public about the Monticello plant in Minnesota on 27 March. Photograph: Adam Bettcher/Reuters Even though Xcel did not announce the leak publicly, they notified the Regulatory Commission, which is a federal agency, and the state and in November, according to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. The company reported that about 400,000 gallons of water containing tritium leaked from a pipe at the facility. The regulators concluded that the spill had not reached the Mississippi River or contaminated drinking water sources near the plant. “While we immediately informed state and federal agencies, with no immediate safety risk, we focused on investigating the situation and containing the affected water in concert with our regulatory agencies,” Kevin Coss, an Xcel Energy spokesperson, stated in an email to the Guardian. “Making the announcement when we did allowed us to provide the public a more accurate and complete understanding of the leak and our plan to resolve it.” Smith said she agreed that the leak did not pose a significant safety risk but “learning about it months after really doesn’t help the industry”. After the announcement, Xcel held two open houses about the leaks. The company also shut the plant down after discovering the second leak but said it would reopen this week. Jammes was among hundreds of people to attend the meetings. She and others said they were frustrated that there was no presentation about the leaks and that company representatives just stood at tables and answered only some of attendees’ questions. “It was just a quick question and answer sort of thing, like if you have questions, then we’ll try to answer them, but it was very much: you’re going to hear what we want you to hear,” Jammes said. She wants to know why the pipe broke and what Xcel will do to prevent such accidents. Michael Voll, a 60-year-old warehouse associate, also criticized the company’s approach at the meetings. He has lived in Monticello for most his life and said Xcel, which opened the plant in 1971, has benefited the local economy. “You didn’t have to come from a nuclear submarine. You could go out there, and if your uncle or your dad worked there, you probably were going to get a job,” Voll said. He also remains a supporter of nuclear energy and has never feared the plant. But after the leaks and the public meetings, he said his trust in Xcel “is way down”. Xcel sent the pipe that leaked to an independent group, where experts are studying it to determine what caused it to fail, Coss, the Xcel spokesperson stated. “The results will help us understand whether there are other potential steps we need to take at the plant,” he wrote. The company also will conduct a “thorough inspection” of the plant while it’s offline for refueling this month, Coss added. Xcel “will work to maintain” the community’s trust, Coss wrote, “by thoroughly cleaning up the leaked tritium and providing prompt updates if anything about the situation changes”.","Id":"us-news/2023/apr/07/minnesota-nuclear-power-plant-leak-safety","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"Leaks from Minnesota nuclear power plant raise safety fears across US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/07/minnesota-nuclear-power-plant-leak-safety","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/apr/07/minnesota-nuclear-power-plant-leak-safety","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":899,"webPublicationDate":"2023-04-07T10:00:49Z","id":"us-news/2023/apr/07/minnesota-nuclear-power-plant-leak-safety","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"UN nuclear watchdog says fighting near Ukraine power plant is ‘intensifying’","body":"The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has made a second visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine amid an escalation in the fighting around it. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA director general, was shown around the plant by Russian occupying forces and officials, telling reporters: “It is obvious that military activity is increasing in this whole region, so every possible measure and precautions should be taken so that the plant is not attacked. “I think it’s no secret that there is a significant increase in the number of troops in the region, and there is open talk about offensive and counter offensives,” he added. The plant is on the south bank of the Dnieper river, which forms the frontline at a time when Russian forces have attempted to conduct a series of offensives and Ukraine is widely expected to launch a counter-offensive in the coming months. Grossi was accompanying three IAEA inspectors who will replace an outgoing monitoring team and are due to stay at the site for the next two months, the seventh team to take up the rotating role since the agency’s presence was accepted by Kyiv and Moscow. The director general is also in Zaporizhzhia to continue efforts to negotiate protections for the plant, which would require the agreement of Ukrainian and Russian forces not to fire in or out of the area. “There have been different concepts that we have been working on. Initially we were focusing on the possibility of the establishment of a well-determined zone around the plant. Now the concept is evolving and refocusing more on the protection itself and the things that should be avoided,” he said on Wednesday. “It is a work in progress.” The negotiations have so far stalled on Russian refusal to withdraw its armed forces from the plant, a Ukrainian precondition for agreement. Grossi has repeatedly warned that a direct hit or a breakdown in safety systems could cause a catastrophe. Interactive “What we need is to protect the nuclear power plant, because if we don’t do that, there is a high risk of a major nuclear accident which is going to spare no one, Ukrainians or Russians,” Grossi told reporters on a visit to Washington earlier this month. He said that while he was trying to negotiate a protection zone, it would not try to attribute daily responsibility for the shelling. “I’m still engaged in the effort, so you may understand that it wouldn’t be very wise for me to start saying who is to blame. It’s a process. It is a complex negotiation,” he said. “So this is why we avoid getting into apportioning blame because it will be a never ending story. What we need is an agreement, a solid political commitment, not to do this.” “There is a quite obvious increase in the number of troops on both sides and military equipment,” he told the New York Times this week. “Our teams are also observing and hearing and seeing more military activity, including detonations, regular, almost permanent.” Zaporizhzhia is the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe, but all six of its reactors have been shut down. Two of them are in “hot shutdown”, meaning they continue to give up a limited amount of energy to power safety and heating systems. It is however a difficult state to maintain, and the 3,000 remaining Ukrainian workers there, a quarter of the normal staff, are facing constant stress and exhaustion. “Things continue but the situation is not sustainable,” Grossi said.","Id":"world/2023/mar/29/un-nuclear-watchdog-says-fighting-near-ukraine-power-plant-is-intensifying","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"UN nuclear watchdog says fighting near Ukraine power plant is ‘intensifying’ ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/29/un-nuclear-watchdog-says-fighting-near-ukraine-power-plant-is-intensifying","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/29/un-nuclear-watchdog-says-fighting-near-ukraine-power-plant-is-intensifying","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":590,"webPublicationDate":"2023-03-29T17:18:08Z","id":"world/2023/mar/29/un-nuclear-watchdog-says-fighting-near-ukraine-power-plant-is-intensifying","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Jeremy Hunt wants nuclear power classed as ‘sustainable’: is it?","body":"Jeremy Hunt has kickstarted a fresh push into nuclear power, which he hopes will provide a quarter of Britain’s electricity by 2050. In his budget speech, the chancellor announced a competition to co-fund small nuclear plants and hopes a new delivery body, Great British Nuclear, will ease the creation of nuclear projects. He also launched a consultation to classify nuclear as “environmentally sustainable”. But is it? Does Britain need nuclear power? Hunt follows in the footsteps of the former prime minister Boris Johnson in making bold statements on the importance of nuclear. Britain’s nuclear power stations date back to the 1950s and are now ageing, with just one, Sizewell B, still scheduled to be running after 2028. Last week, France’s EDF – which operates the stations – said it had extended the life of two other plants. Proponents argue that nuclear provides a “baseload” of power that can be relied on, whereas renewable energy such as wind and solar is dependent on weather conditions, meaning it cannot always help match supply with demand. There are also high hopes for nuclear fusion as an energy source, but this has not been commercialised. default Why is nuclear being reclassified? To attract private investment. The consultation is on the “taxonomy” or financial classification system of energy. This is important as there have been a proliferation of funds dedicated to environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments springing up in global financial markets in recent years. These funds promise their investors that their cash is going towards social good, such as tackling the climate crisis. Hunt was also under pressure to respond to the Inflation Reduction Act, Joe Biden’s $369bn climate subsidy package. Is Britain the first country to do this? No. The European Commission decided last year to label nuclear as a “green” investment. The EU’s parliament said the taxonomy change aimed “to boost green investments and prevent ‘greenwashing’”. However, the decision has faced legal challenges by groups including Greenpeace. Will it make a difference? Nuclear projects cost tens of billions of pounds to develop and build, so smoothing the path to secure investment is seen as crucial. In the UK, the government has tasked bankers with finding funders for Sizewell C, in partnership with EDF, after easing China General Nuclear out of the project over security fears. The government has committed £700m to the Suffolk plant, which could cost more than £30bn to build. Its sister site, Hinkley Point C in Somerset, has been beset with delays and cost overruns. Senior industry sources said the taxonomy change would help in the hunt for Sizewell C’s funders. The backers of small modular reactors, including a programme developed by Rolls-Royce, will also hope to receive significant investment. Rolls-Royce’s’ aim is to create a fleet of smaller, factory-built nuclear plants across Britain. Is nuclear energy renewable? Uranium, the element used in nuclear power, is a finite resource, which is mined from the ground and not considered renewable. However, it can be argued that, as nuclear power stations use a very small amount of fuel to generate the same amount of electricity, they are preferable to gas-fired power stations, which are expected to be around for many years. Is it really green? Advocates of nuclear claim it should be seen as a green energy source as it does not release harmful emissions into the air. National Grid says that the “lifecycle emissions” – emissions resulting from every stage of the production process – are also significantly lower than in fossil fuel-based generation. Hunt said on Wednesday that “increasing nuclear capacity is vital to meet our net zero obligations”. However, there are questions over how useful nuclear will realistically be in this mission. As projects take years to build – Sizewell C could be finished by the mid-2030s at a push – it can be argued that pursuing the project could prove a drain on government and financial resources, which could be better spent on rapidly scaling up Britain’s wind and solar capacity and improving electricity networks and storage. An effective ban on onshore wind developments remains in place. Nuclear detractors also say nuclear cannot be seen as sustainable given the concerns over the potential environmental hazards in the long term. Shutting down sites such as Sellafield, in north-west England, will take generations and involves a painstaking process of carefully managing ageing buildings to ensure radioactive waste is not mishandled. In Finland, a huge effort is under way to bury waste in concrete deep underground. It has also been argued that – as nuclear plants need water for cooling so are often built near the coast – rising sea levels could make some projects obsolete before building work is completed. That is not the only concern, is it? No. The history of the nuclear industry has shown an oscillating interest from governments and investors, influenced by a series of devastating incidents including Three Mile Island in 1979, Chornobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011. Russia’s attack on Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear plant, in Ukraine, has again raised concerns over a nuclear incident. .","Id":"environment/2023/mar/16/jeremy-hunt-wants-nuclear-power-classed-as-sustainable-is-it","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt wants nuclear power classed as ‘sustainable’: is it?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/16/jeremy-hunt-wants-nuclear-power-classed-as-sustainable-is-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/16/jeremy-hunt-wants-nuclear-power-classed-as-sustainable-is-it","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":836,"webPublicationDate":"2023-03-16T13:36:37Z","id":"environment/2023/mar/16/jeremy-hunt-wants-nuclear-power-classed-as-sustainable-is-it","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Ukrainian dam collapse ‘no immediate risk’ to Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant","body":"The collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam and the draining of the reservoir behind it does not pose an immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant further upstream, but will have long-term implications for its future, according to Ukrainian and UN experts. The Ukrainian nuclear energy corporation, Energoatom, put out a statement on the Telegram social media platform saying the situation at the plant, the biggest nuclear power station in Europe, was “under control”. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, said in a statement: “our current assessment is that there is no immediate risk to the safety of the plant.” Related: Nova Kakhovka dam: everything you need to know about Ukraine’s strategically important reservoir But there are long-term concerns, both over safety and the possibility of the plant becoming operational again in the coming years. Oleksiy, a former reactor operator and shift supervisor at the plant, pointed out that all six reactors had been shut down since the plant found itself on the frontline after the Russian invasion. Five of the reactors are in “cold shutdown”, turned off completely and being cooled, and one is in “hot shutdown”, kept at 200-250C so it would be easier to restart if conditions allowed, and to supply winter heating to the neighbouring town of Energodar. Interactive Oleksiy, who left after Russian forces occupied the plant in March last year and is now elsewhere in Ukraine, said the last reactor should be shut down and that the plant had sufficient resources to keep all reactor cores cool. “I think that the damage of the dam doesn’t impact the plant immediately, because they are being cooled by the safety systems located at the plant, which are spray systems,” he said. “The plant has a cooling lake, about two or three kilometres in diameter.” The Energoatom statement said the cooling lake was filled and was at 16.6 metres (54.5ft), “which is sufficient for the power plant’s needs”. Interactive Mariana Budjeryn, a Ukrainian nuclear scientist, said: “The fact that there’s an artificial pond next to the ZNPP [Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant] where water can be maintained above the reservoir level, and the fact that the reactors are in cold shutdown, offers some reassurance and increased time to respond if ZNPP starts getting affected.” But Budjeryn, who is a senior research associate on the project on managing the atom at Harvard University, added: “The bigger problem – who is going to do it? ZNPP is already down-staffed to bare bones.” Oleksiy said that over time water would evaporate from the cooling lake and if it could not be filled from the vast reservoir created upstream of the Nova Kakhovka dam, the turbines and the power plant could not be operated. In his statement, Grossi said that the cooling pond should last “for some months” but it was imperative it was not damaged in fighting. The water is used to cool not just the reactor cores, but also the spent fuel and the diesel generators used for safety systems. Callout “Absence of cooling water in the essential cooling water systems for an extended period of time would cause fuel melt and inoperability of the emergency diesel generators,” he warned. Budjeryn pointed to another implication of the dam collapse regarding the future of the Russian occupied nuclear plant, which Russian occupying forces have allegedly mined. “If the Russians would do this with Kakhovka, there’s no guarantee they won’t blow up the reactor units at ZNPP that are also reportedly mined – three of the six,” she said. “It wouldn’t cause a Chornobyl, but massive disruption, local contamination and long-term damage to Ukraine.”","Id":"world/2023/jun/06/nova-kakhovka-ukraine-dam-collapse-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-iaea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Ukrainian dam collapse ‘no immediate risk’ to Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/06/nova-kakhovka-ukraine-dam-collapse-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-iaea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/06/nova-kakhovka-ukraine-dam-collapse-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-iaea","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":597,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-06T10:14:30Z","id":"world/2023/jun/06/nova-kakhovka-ukraine-dam-collapse-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-iaea","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Atomic Hope review – a powerful case for pressing the nuclear power button","body":"Here is a film that returns us to a thorny revisionist subject which I haven’t seen aired in documentary form since the film Pandora’s Promise in 2013 – which isn’t mentioned here, though a poster for it is visible in one shot. For many environmentalists, the last realistic hope we have to avert climate disaster is the great unthinkable, the great unmentionable: stop worrying and learn to love nuclear energy, because nuclear is a colossally efficient and very clean energy source. Like Pandora’s Promise, Atomic Hope revisits the case studies of Chornobyl and Fukushima and argues that, although clearly catastrophic, a mythology of horror has grown up around these events that has stymied all debate and shut down thought. The film doesn’t say so, but another way the eco-nuclear movement became tainted was perhaps a speech by Margaret Thatcher to the UN general assembly which made the case in 1989, partly to undermine the coal industry as a trade union powerbase. At any rate, here again is the argument: nuclear energy provides the clean, climate-friendly energy we need. Renewables such as wind and solar are important, but progress on them is desperately slow and time is running out. The risks of nuclear are real, but they are misunderstood and uncontextualised, safety measures have evolved and risk must in any case now be considered in the light of clear and present danger of the global harm from fossil fuels. But none of this is easy. Generations have been brought up on the idea that nuclear equals apocalypse. Convincing them of the opposite is a challenge. Guardian readers will know that George Monbiot has ventilated ideas on this issue. The inevitable question is: what does Greta think? This film was apparently made too late to include Thunberg’s startling intervention in October 2022, when she claimed the German government was wrong to close down nuclear plants in favour of coal. Anything that stimulates discussion of this issue is to be welcomed. • Atomic Hope is released on 17 February in cinemas.","Id":"film/2023/feb/15/atomic-hope-review-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webTitle":"Atomic Hope review – a powerful case for pressing the nuclear power button","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/15/atomic-hope-review-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/feb/15/atomic-hope-review-nuclear-power","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts","wordcount":340,"webPublicationDate":"2023-02-15T09:00:07Z","id":"film/2023/feb/15/atomic-hope-review-nuclear-power","hosted":false},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Tonga volcano explosion equalled most powerful ever US nuclear test","body":"A huge underwater volcanic event in Tonga last year was of a magnitude comparable with the most powerful nuclear detonation by the US, researchers have revealed. Scientists have used eye and earwitnesses accounts, along with data from tide gauges, satellites, evidence of broken windows and other sources, to calculate that the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano, which occurred on 15 January 2022 and was felt around the world, likely involved five blasts. The last of them released energy equivalent to about 15 megatonnes of TNT. That is around 1,000 times more powerful than the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, and puts the volcanic event on a par with the most powerful nuclear device ever detonated by the US: the Castle Bravo bomb detonated at Bikini Atoll in 1954. The team, based at institutions in the US and New Zealand, added that the volcanic event, which occurred 65km (40 miles) from the country’s main island, involved both eruptions – which resulted in huge volcanic plumes being thrust into the stratosphere – and explosions of steam, which caused sonic booms and were the main cause of the related tsunami. The researchers’ computer simulations of the event, based on a combination of data sources, suggest the western coast of Tofua Island experienced waves of up to 45 metres in height, a result they say is backed up by signs of vegetation scars at the same altitude captured by satellite and drone data. The eruption brought reports of people experiencing the ground and buildings shaking for hours as far away as Fiji – nearly 500 miles away. It is thought that six people died as a result of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcanic event, including four people in Tonga and two in Peru who drowned as a result of abnormally large waves caused by the volcanic activity. The team say the huge waves in parts of Tonga would have been expected to result in a larger death toll – yet this was not the case. “The main factors that led to this, we suggest, are the quirk of the location, a worldwide pandemic, and increased evaluation drills and awareness efforts carried out in the years prior,” they write in the journal Science Advances. Tofua is uninhabited and other areas that experienced large waves were sparsely populated, while tourist resorts were closed because of Covid. “The main settlements in all of Tonga safely face Nuku’alofa Lagoon, the best possible scenario to duck the full brunt of a mega-tsunami,” the authors note, adding that other inhabited islands sit atop a carbonate platform where shallow waters damped down the waves. Related: Tonga volcano: a visual guide to the eruption and its aftermath The new study follows research published last year that revealed that the Tonga volcano eruption had the highest plume ever recorded, with an ash cloud that reached 57km (35 miles) in height. Dr Mohammad Heidarzadeh of the University of Bath, who was not involved in the new study but has also carried out research into the event, said the latest work offered the most detailed modelling of the Tonga tsunami so far by benefiting from a diverse observation dataset. “Modelling tsunamis from volcano eruptions is a challenging task and this has been nicely done by [the team],” he said. “It is interesting that the results are consistent with our previous study on this event, where we reported a maximum tsunami wave height of 90m.”","Id":"world/2023/apr/14/tonga-volcano-explosion-equalled-most-powerful-ever-us-nuclear-test","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Tonga volcano explosion equalled most powerful ever US nuclear test","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/14/tonga-volcano-explosion-equalled-most-powerful-ever-us-nuclear-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/14/tonga-volcano-explosion-equalled-most-powerful-ever-us-nuclear-test","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":564,"webPublicationDate":"2023-04-14T18:00:19Z","id":"world/2023/apr/14/tonga-volcano-explosion-equalled-most-powerful-ever-us-nuclear-test","hosted":false}]
