If you own more than one property, it’s almost like you’re resented for it,” the opposition leader, John Pesutto, said on Thursday. “If you want to work hard and send your child to an independent school, you get punished for it. “If you have dreams, if you have aspirations, they want to target you.” Related: ‘Hitlist’ of private schools criticised and businesses and public sector join outcry over Victorian budget The criticism of the budget’s tax hikes for large businesses and property investors extends beyond the confines of parliament. Business groups say the measures create a disincentive to invest in Victoria, the property sector says it will raise rents, while private schools warn it will lead to fee increases. All of the critiques share something in common – they characterise those affected by the budget measures as “ordinary Victorians” – “mum-and-dad investors” – working in occupations such as trades, nursing and emergency services, or taking on a second job to get their children through private schools. The Liberal party, built on the values of individual enterprise, has successfully prosecuted successive federal Labor leaders for stifling “aspiration” for decades. The strategy is credited with the party’s success at the 2004 election – when the then Labor leader, Mark Latham, took to the polls a plan to increase funding for poorer schools by reducing support for the wealthiest – and in 2019, when Bill Shorten proposed sweeping changes to the federal tax system, including a cap on negative gearing on investment properties. Indeed, Scott Morrison’s framing of the 2019 election as a “choice between aspiration and envy” has scared Labor off pursuing tax reform ever since. But according to Kos Samaras, a former Victorian Labor assistant state secretary who is now a pollster with RedBridge Group, the “appeal to aspiration” won’t work as successfully in 2023 as it did in the past. “The Liberals have got themselves trapped in the Howard era. Appealing to aspiration only works in times of great economic prosperity, as it was then,” Samaras says. “We are not living through that period now. People don’t think things are going to get better. Quite the opposite.” Samaras says Daniel Andrews and his treasurer, Tim Pallas, are concerned less about class than they are about ensuring the state is left in a better position for young people. “It’s not class warfare, it’s generational warfare,” Samaras says. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads While the premier and Pallas have repeatedly denied Tuesday’s budget has ignited a so-called “class-war”, they admit their plan to repay about $31.5bn worth of borrowings accrued during the pandemic is targeted at “those within an ability to pay”. This includes big business and property investors, who face an increase in payroll and land taxes, respectively, which is expected to raise a significant $8.6bn over four years. About 110 “high-fee” private schools are also positioned to lose what the premier has described as a “sweetheart deal” that saw them exempt from payroll tax, saving the government $422.2m. “Whilst our kids will remember Covid, I will not ask them to pay for it,” Andrews repeatedly said at press conferences this week. Pallas used a similar line during the budget media lockup: “We’re ensuring that while our kids will of course have memories of the trauma that was the Covid years, they won’t necessarily be paying for [it].” Samaras says the government is acutely aware of frustrations of the “fastest-growing political demographic” – voters aged under 40, who now make up more than a third of the electoral roll. He says the budget builds on this group’s disenchantment with older generations who, thanks to the Howard government’s generous tax concessions, have built wealth through the property market. “Ask a young person about aspiration, and they’ll reply, ‘What are you talking about?’” Samaras says. “Their student debt is huge and it’s only going up. They can barely get a rental property, they are putting off having kids because they can’t find stable housing. “They’re not part of the asset class. They do not care about new taxes.” Samaras says there wasn’t much to lose for Labor in handing down this budget. By the 2026 election, Samaras says most will have forgotten about it. Those who haven’t will “probably vote for the opposition”. He says the Liberals’ attack line “plays to the base”, but won’t resonate with the younger voters the party needs to attract. However, there are concerns among suburban Labor MPs that the land tax changes could backfire, given the economic climate. “I know it’s a cliche, but they’re genuinely mum and dad investors who bought a second property to help their kids out, and now they’re hurting,” one MP says, noting the Reserve Bank’s decision to raise interest rates 11 times in 12 months. Another MP said Labor could also face backlash from young people if warnings that rents will rise are accurate. Dr Zareh Ghazarian, a senior politics lecturer at Monash University, says while the timing of the budget – well ahead of the next election – will help Labor, it does come with political risk. “In the current climate, cost of living and issues concerning the economy are really high priorities and they are really dominating the public debate. People – regardless of their age or if they renters or owners – will be asking about what this will mean for them, bottom line, and potential future aspirations,” he says. Ghazarian says there is political capital to be gained for the Coalition in returning to the theme of aspiration, after failing to land a coherent policy platform at the November election. “They’ve been running around in circles without being able to make any clear signals to the electorate as to what they would do that would be significantly different to the Labor party,” he says. Related: About 300,000 Victorians who use negative gearing could claim land tax hikes as deductions “This finally presents them with an opportunity to do that. It could be a circuit breaker.” David Hayward, an emeritus professor at RMIT and chair of the Victorian government’s social housing regulation review, says the premier has successfully engaged in expectation management, having painted the budget as “difficult” in the months leading up to it. “The premier was all doom and gloom, all the talk was about a horror budget. But this is a big-spending traditional Labor budget … with new taxes to help foot the bill,” he says. Hayward says the government had managed to achieve a “significant shift” in the way debt – heading for $171.4bn by 2026/27 – is talked about. “What the government builds and the services it provides now matters more than what it owes,” he says. “While all the media are talking about the debt and the new taxes, there are more trains, level crossing removals, hospitals and schools. I think that’s what matters most to people.” But Hayward and Samaras said Labor risks losing its political capital if it doesn’t go further in addressing the housing affordability crisis. It appears the government is one step ahead: Andrews this week flagged measures to boost housing supply, to be announced in the coming months, while Pallas floated the idea of rent caps, firing up the chorus of critics once again.","Id":"australia-news/2023/may/27/class-war-aspiration-and-the-politics-of-property-the-heated-debate-over-the-victorian-budget","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Class war, aspiration and the politics of property: the heated debate over the Victorian budget","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/27/class-war-aspiration-and-the-politics-of-property-the-heated-debate-over-the-victorian-budget","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/27/class-war-aspiration-and-the-politics-of-property-the-heated-debate-over-the-victorian-budget","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":1212,"webPublicationDate":"2023-05-26T15:00:38Z","hosted":false,"id":"australia-news/2023/may/27/class-war-aspiration-and-the-politics-of-property-the-heated-debate-over-the-victorian-budget"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Labour needs an ‘honest debate’ about Brexit damage, union warns","body":"The leader of one of the country’s biggest unions has urged Labour to conduct an “honest debate” about the economic damage being caused to working people by Brexit, as evidence grows that it is fuelling inflation and driving jobs and investment abroad. In an interview with the Observer, Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB union, which is one of Labour’s biggest financial backers, giving more than £1m a year, said politicians of all parties had been too afraid to admit the adverse consequences that leaving the EU was having on jobs and life in working communities. “There has been a lack of honesty and a fear among politicians to face up to the impact that Brexit is having in terms of the economy,” said Smith, whose union has more than 500,000 members across the UK. “In terms of what the future looks like, it needs to start from a position of honesty. It is hitting trade. It is hitting investment and we need a new settlement. “We know that we are not going to be re-entering the EU. But we have to recognise that the frictions at borders are one of the factors behind inflation. It is bad for jobs and it is bad for investment.” The GMB leader cited warnings from the drug giant AstraZeneca – which employs many GMB workers – about its future investments in the UK in the post-Brexit era, saying he worried that the company would switch production to the EU if it found trading and tax arrangements were more favourable there. Smith’s comments echo frustration among pro-EU Labour backers and supporters at the party’s reluctance to do more to expose Brexit’s failings or advocate a clearer plan for a closer relationship if it wins the next election. Some senior Labour strategists fear alienating its many backers who voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum. In an article in the Daily Express last week, Keir Starmer attempted a delicate balancing act, trying to reassure the paper’s overwhelmingly Tory-supporting readership that he would not take the UK back into the EU or single market, while also making clear that the Brexit deal negotiated by Boris Johnson’s government had not worked and would need to be revisited. “Britain’s future is outside the EU,” Starmer said, despite having been the most senior Labour figure most in favour of holding a second referendum on membership before becoming leader. “Not in the single market, not in the customs union, not with a return to freedom of movement. Those arguments are in the past, where they belong,” he said, while adding that “there’s no point pretending that everything is working fine”. Ahead of the GMB annual conference in Brighton this week, Smith said he had been encouraged by much that Labour’s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, had said about the party’s economic agenda for government, including its plans to foster a new “green industrial revolution” through investment in wind, solar and tidal energy. But, as with Brexit, he was concerned that the drive to more renewable energy – and the expansion of nuclear – under the Conservatives had so far merely created jobs abroad rather than here in the UK. Under Labour, there needed to be a “new settlement” involving the unions, with guarantees that employment would be created in the renewable and other sectors in this country. “We have some of the biggest windfarms in the world but almost no jobs in fabrication and manufacture of the windfarms. “The windfarms off the east coast of the UK have been produced in China and Indonesia, and by Middle Eastern sovereign oil- and gas-backed wealth funds.” Smith’s intervention is evidence of the unions wanting to play a role in shaping Labour’s economic policy ahead of a general election expected next year. Related: Labour planning £8bn Biden-style green energy revolution What was needed from Starmer and Reeves, Smith said, was an economic vision as radical as that produced by the US president, Joe Biden, which ensured that green investment projects were linked to domestic production and home-grown job creation: “We do not see ourselves as having political saviours,” said Smith, “but we do want a Labour government and I want to see a proactive industrial strategy from Labour that actually safeguards what we still have in terms of manufacturing jobs, and which does support the creation of work in any green transition.” The GMB leader has not been afraid to criticise Labour in strong terms. He repeated his attack on the party for saying it would ban future North Sea oil and gas drilling, describing it as “naive”. Smith claimed that it would mean importing more oil and gas from abroad and cost jobs in coastal communities. But despite flexing his muscles, he was clear that a Labour government would be massively preferable to another Conservative one. “The Tories are trying to break organised Labour with their anti-union legislation …. There is no national economic plan and our public services have been starved of investment. And, after 13 years, what we have got is Tory squalor in the public services. “The lack of industrial strategy, the lack of an industrial plan, has done enormous damage in terms of investment and opportunities.”","Id":"politics/2023/jun/03/labour-needs-an-honest-debate-about-brexit-damage-union-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Labour needs an ‘honest debate’ about Brexit damage, union warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/03/labour-needs-an-honest-debate-about-brexit-damage-union-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/jun/03/labour-needs-an-honest-debate-about-brexit-damage-union-warns","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":869,"webPublicationDate":"2023-06-03T11:57:34Z","hosted":false,"id":"politics/2023/jun/03/labour-needs-an-honest-debate-about-brexit-damage-union-warns"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"PM launches draft strategy for care economy – as it happened","body":"5.12am BST What we learned, Sunday 28 May That’s that for our live news blog for the day.

According to the strategy, government spending in the sectors is expected to rise from $60bn in the last tax year to $110bn by the middle of 2027. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said he wanted the public’s input. Every Australian should have access to high quality care and support, and that means we need to invest in high quality jobs in this sector. The care and support workforce is integral to the Australian economy, particularly as demand for aged care and early education services is on the rise.

Indigenous Australians minister Linda Burney accused opposition leader Peter Dutton of “playing politics” with the Indigenous voice to parliament referendum and dividing Australians. Former NSW Liberal party president Maria Kovacic will replace the late senator for NSW Jim Molan after winning a preselection vote on Saturday. A third teenager came forward to assist police after a fire engulfed a seven-storey building in Sydney’s CBD on Thursday. Calls are growing for a parliamentary inquiry into use of force by NSW police with justice experts saying too much focus is placed on individual police officers rather than a “festering” systemic problem.

Meanwhile, the chemicals yield comparatively paltry profits for the world’s largest PFAS manufacturers – about $4bn annually. Related: Toxic ‘forever chemicals’ found in toilet paper around the world The report, compiled by ChemSec, a Sweden-based NGO that works with industry and policymakers to limit the use of toxic chemicals, partially aims to highlight how the “astronomical” cost of using PFAS is shouldered by governments typically forced to fund the cleanup of pollution and individuals who suffer from health consequences. “If you compare the profits that they make and the cost to society – it’s ridiculous,” said Peter Pierrou, ChemSec’s communications director. PFAS are a class of about 15,000 chemicals often used to make products resistant to water, stains and heat. The chemicals are ubiquitous, and linked at low levels of exposure to cancer, thyroid disease, kidney dysfunction, birth defects, autoimmune disease and other serious health problems. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally degrade. The chemicals are thought to be contaminating drinking water for at least 200 million Americans, while watchdogs have identified thousands of industrial polluters. Similar widespread contamination persists throughout Europe. ChemSec found 12 companies account for most of the world’s PFAS production and pollution. Among them are 3M, Chemours, Solvay, Daikin, Honeywell, BASF, Merck and Bayer, though 3M this year announced it would discontinue making PFAS in part because of regulatory pressure and litigation. The report grew out of ChemSec’s work with investment firms to pressure companies to eliminate PFAS, Pierrou said. A letter on the issue circulated late last year and now signed by largely European Union investment firms holding $11tn in assets cites recent litigation brought against PFAS manufacturers, ever-increasing regulation that imposes strict limits on the chemicals’ use and the compounds’ public health threat. Investors have raised questions about companies’ PFAS production and uses, Pierrou added, but industry often tries to keep information around the chemicals from public view as it attempts to evade account or protect “trade secrets”. “There is low transparency and there is so much we don’t know,” Pierrou said. “[Investment firms] have the power to ask these questions because they own part of the company, so they have the right to ask ‘What’s going on here?’” The analysis broke down societal costs into four categories. Soil and water remediation are the most expensive, followed by healthcare costs and bio-monitoring of PFAS pollution. While the average market price of PFAS is about €19 (about $20.75) for each kilogram, the price spikes to about €18,734 ($20,456.78) for each kilogram when societal costs are factored in. Beyond profits and pollution, the analysis also provides a closer look at how the chemicals are used across the economy, and whether those uses are “essential” or “non-essential”. Those questions are likely to become a focal point in the debate over the chemicals’ use in upcoming years as proposed legislation in the EU would ban the chemicals except for essential uses, and a law passed in Maine that goes into effect in 2030 takes a similar approach. Banning non-essential uses would probably spell the end of the chemicals in most consumer goods and cut deeply into the industry’s profits. PFAS are used in thousands of consumer products, but public health advocates argue most of those uses are not essential because viable, safer alternatives exist. The chemicals are commonly used as waterproofing agents in clothing and textiles, applied to create non-stick barriers on cookware and utilized to greaseproof paper food packaging. Those functions can be achieved without PFAS, advocates note. However, the industry generally counters with claims that most PFAS produced are deployed for essential purposes, such as medical devices, energy production and pharmaceuticals. ChemSec agreed that many of those uses are essential, but still found just 8% of PFAS are used for “essential” purposes. Among those that it found to be essential were semiconductors, though researchers are already developing safe alternatives. “There are so many industry voices that are opposing the PFAS ban and they are using the ‘essential use’ concept as an excuse: ‘We cannot ban PFAS or everything will sink and go under,’” Pierrou said. “The parts that are ‘essential’ are really minor and there are so many uses we could do without.” • The subheading and text of this article were amended on 12 & 14 & 15 May 2023.

Here is a wrap of the day’s biggest stories: A gunshot fired into a Macquarie Fields primary school classroom in Sydney midday was “without much weight behind it”, being stopped by a blind after shattering a window. The incident is being investigated and there were no reports of injuries to any students or staff at the school. Demolition work has begun on the century-old Sydney hat factory that was destroyed in a once-in-a-decade blaze, as police speak with a fourth teenage boy over the incident. Senator Mehreen Faruqi has revealed she has “experienced racism in the Greens” as leader Adam Bandt declined to rule out that the party had received complaints about alleged racism beyond one expected from Lidia Thorpe. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, made a stirring voice plea during a speech in Adelaide, saying all Australians would wake up on referendum morning with “the strongest sense of ourselves”. Meanwhile, the independent senator Jacqui Lambie has threatened to disrupt the Senate “every hour for two weeks straight” unless the government releases more information about the potential stripping of medals from former commanders of Australian special forces in Afghanistan. Promised pay rises for NSW frontline workers will be funded by a two-year freeze on the wages of state politicians and public service senior executives. In continuing PwC news, Defence officials revealed that Defence currently has 54 current contracts with PwC with a total contact value of about $223m. Updated at 9.39am BST 9.34am BST No tax lost due to PwC breach: ATO The Australian Taxation Officer commissioner, Chris Jordan, has just given an opening statement about how it became aware of PwC’s alleged breach of confidentiality. Jordan said the ATO became aware in 2016 of a “handful of multinationals suspiciously and quickly seeking to restructure” in response to a new multinational tax avoidance law. Jordan said the ATO commenced a number of reviews and audits. It was hampered by inappropriate claims of legal professional privilege. The ATO was concerned by “artificial schemes marketed by PwC” and discovered a matter of “significant concern” in the Collins matter, a potential breach of confidentiality, he said. Jordan said the ATO lacks “criminal investigative powers” so was not able to investigate further because the breach of confidentiality was “not a tax offence”. It referred information to the Australian Federal Police in 2018 and 2019, and formally referred it to the Tax Practitioners Board in July 2020. Jordan reassured the community “we got on top of this early ... we stopped any tax loss from this egregious behaviour”. Jeremy Hirschhorn, the second commissioner, said this was because the two or three companies which had restructured reversed those actions, and other companies proposing to decided against it. 9.18am BST Sussan Ley: ‘it’s OK to vote no’ in voice referendum Deputy Liberal leader Sussan Ley has told parliament “it’s OK to vote no” in the Indigenous voice referendum, saying “millions” of people will vote against the constitutional change. In a speech on the referendum, expected to be one of the last before the lower house votes on the bill, Ley branded the PM, Anthony Albanese, “the self-proclaimed ‘moral arbiter’ of Australia’s national conscience, not as a leader seeking consensus”. She claimed: Again, and again when given the opportunity to provide the detail, the prime minister takes the low road and hurls insults instead. Ley called on the government to pull back on its plan for the referendum and instead legislate the voice while changing the referendum question to one of simple constitutional recognition for Australia’s Indigenous people. The government has committed to enshrining the voice as a form of constitutional recognition, pointing to the long-held rejection of simple rejection by Indigenous-led processes. But Ley accused Albanese of “moral blackmail” on the referendum. She said: It’s OK to vote no and still remain part of the national effort to help your Indigenous brothers and sisters, as you look on with anguish at what is happening in their communities. It’s OK to vote no and still demand better action from all politicians when it comes to closing the gap. It’s OK to vote no, full stop. And it’s OK to vote yes, too. The debate on the bill is likely to come to an end tonight, before votes on the bill tomorrow. It will then go to the Senate, which sits in two weeks’ time (this week being another round of estimates hearings). Updated at 9.25am BST 9.11am BST Gunshot fired into Macquarie Fields primary school was ‘without much weight behind it’ Police have just finished speaking to the media about a shot being fired into the window of a Macquarie Fields public school around midday today. The officer said a bullet was fired into the classroom of a Year 1 and 2 class but it was stopped by the blind. They just heard a window smash in their classroom. It was a totally reckless act by somebody who is acting in a way with a firearm that is very dangerous to the community. [The students have] heard a windows smash, the bullet has come into the classroom, but it’s been stopped by the blind. So it hasn’t come into the classroom with any speed or velocity. It’s just enough to smash the window. The officer said it was “a bullet without much weight behind it”. Size doesn’t matter, it’s about the force behind it, so it hasn’t had that much force behind it. … we believe it could come from a distance but it could have hit something … so we can’t say exactly what happened until the … team had finished [investigating]. There were no reports of injuries to any students or staff at the school following the shot, and the school was not placed into lockdown. Updated at 9.15am BST 9.00am BST Campbell says he encouraged deputy PM to seek independent views on command accountability for military in Afghanistan Angus Campbell also told the hearing it was open to the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, to seek additional advice from a third party about the issue of command accountability in Afghanistan. The chief of the Australian defence force told the Greens senator, David Shoebridge: Senator, I can assure you, although I appreciate that you would wish an independent assurance, that this has been done in meticulous consistency. And the deputy prime minister – I have encouraged that he seek independent views. Updated at 9.14am BST 8.55am BST General Angus Campbell outlines how he avoided conflict of interest in reviewing own performance as a commander The chief of the Australian defence force, Gen Angus Campbell, says he considered appointing one of his predecessors to review his own performance as a commander in Afghanistan, but “didn’t want to give them that pain”. Campbell has provided more details about the review into command accountability, in response to questions from the Greens senator David Shoebridge in a Senate estimates committee hearing this evening. Readers will recall that earlier today Campbell said his own performance was included in a review into command accountability in Afghanistan. He had said the focus was on “a small number of persons who held command appointments during particular periods of operational service in Afghanistan” and that the matter was now being considered by the defence minister, Richard Marles. During this evening’s hearing, Campbell confirmed that he was the one who undertook the review. Asked by Shoebridge how he had dealt with that “conflict of interest”, Campbell said there was a three-step process. Marles would consider the issue next and then ultimately it would be for the governor general to sign off any any recommended action. Campbell said Marles had “access to all of my considerations” and had the power to act if he “were to regard my considerations inadequate, inconsistent or self interested”. Campbell said he did not feel he could appoint someone else from within the ADF to review his command accountability, because that idea “suffers from the reality that they are all under my command”. Campbell added: I did consider whether I might refer myself to some of my predecessors. But quite frankly, with the level of emotion and unintentional and also intentional disinformation about this issue, I quite frankly, didn’t want to give them that pain. Updated at 9.14am BST 8.52am BST MP Rick Wilson will dissent from Liberal party on voice issue Liberal MP Rick Wilson has revealed himself as one of the “authorised dissenters” who will vote against the constitutional alteration bill, due to a legislative quirk which would have otherwise barred the Liberal Party from contributing to the official information pamphlet for the referendum. As we brought you earlier, the Liberals have have picked a group of MPs who will vote against the bill – even as the party itself backs the bill in principle. This, as we’ve reported before, comes down to a legal quirk where only those MPs who vote against the alteration bill can have input into the referendum pamphlet sent to all homes. Related: Legal quirk could force some opposition MPs to vote against holding Indigenous voice referendum So because the Liberals will let the referendum occur, even though they oppose the referendum, they wouldn’t be able to help write the pamphlet – unless some MPs oppose the bill. So the Liberal whips oversaw a process to choose some MPs to vote No. The Liberal whips’ office hasn’t responded to our requests for more info, but Wilson – MP for the West Australian seat of O’Connor - just told the parliament he would be voting no on the bill to allow the referendum. He said he was “very much looking forward” to contributing to the pamphlet, but stressed he wasn’t voting no because he didn’t want the referendum to be held - he was just voting no in order to help write the pamphlet. The deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, is due to make a speech of her own shortly.

The call came as the national carrier revealed it had created a $400 million “climate fund” to invest in biofuel projects with Airbus, and for further research in the field. The announcement, made during the airline’s investment event on Tuesday, also follows the Queensland government declaring it would work with Qantas to create an eco-friendly fuel refinery in the state. Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is considered a major pathway to cutting emissions within the aviation industry, which has pledged to reach net zero by 2050. Qantas will use $290m from its $400m climate fund to invest in domestic fuel production with Airbus, including the biofuel refinery project in Queensland, while the remaining $110m goes towards other projects and research in the field. Updated at 8.45am BST 8.14am BST Shot fired into window of Sydney public school Police are expected to front the media within the hour following a report of a shot being fired into the window of a Macquarie Fields public school today. Around 12.45pm, officers were called to the Sydney public school after receiving a report that a classroom window had been broken by a metal projectile. A crime scene was established and an investigation was commenced. There were no reports of injuries to any students or staff at the school, and the school was not placed into lockdown. Investigations have revealed that the object is a small calibre bullet, which has been seized and will be forensically examined by specialist police.

Afternoon Briefing host Greg Jennett asks: Do you understand that Liberal colleagues in both chambers will vote no in order to get themselves impaneled on that no pamphlet campaign exercise? Wolahan: … I’m not sure who they all are, but the few that I’ve spoken to who will [vote no], it’s out of conviction. They have a strongly held view and they’d like to have a stay in what the wording is in the pamphlet… We want that pamphlet to be as clear as it can be for both sides because it will go in every letter box before the referendum. Updated at 7.56am BST 7.41am BST Independent MP targets ‘eating disorder’ online content People would be able to report social media content perceived to be fuelling eating disorders under proposed new powers, AAP reports. Independent federal MP Zoe Daniel will introduce legislation to allow the e-safety commissioner to pull down such social media posts. Under the proposal, a new complaints mechanism would be established so people could raise specific cases of content and issues with the commissioner. Daniel said she had spoken with Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, which was open to new steps: It’s very productive to be having this public conversation – we get to decide as a society, as a community, what is harmful content and where we want those lines to be drawn. There’s also the involvement of the platforms themselves and the self-regulation where they actually get involved in making those nuanced decisions. Goldstein MP Zoe Daniel.

The toll that it takes on you has immense amounts of physiological but also psychological impact and I do not want to downplay that all. This is an avenue that is open, and should be open, to every person in the country as a matter of recourse to talk about institutionalised racism and what their experience have been. She stressed the importance of creating safe spaces for First Nations people to be able to speak about their experiences and tell their stories: I think that is the whole drive behind me entering into politics, it was the reason that I put my hand up to be a Greens senator in the first place… We are an anti-racist party… Updated at 8.11am BST 7.18am BST Many thanks to Amy for taking us through the day.

Updated at 7.59am BST 7.12am BST Greens senator Dorinda Cox is speaking to the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing and is asked about her experience with racism;. Cox says: I have experienced racism on a daily basis and you only have to look at my social media pages and the height of what we now know to be the national conversation happening around The Voice to Parliament and the heightened rate in which I have experienced some of those racist remarks that have been targeted directly towards me. As a Greens senator but also as a First Nations woman and being a first Nations senator particularly, here from WA, as the first Aboriginal woman from WA to federal senate, that obviously, comes with lots of challenges around representation and identity and making workplaces in particular, safe across the country. And I think this is the job not just of political parties but also the responsibility of all of us as Australians to ensure that we are making it safe for everybody and not to experience institutionalised racism. And when I think about my career and the examples that I have particularly, in advocating this for families and communities who have had a lack of response, these goes to the heart of getting responses that are entangled within institutionalised racism and we have to look at those and we have to look at understanding the core or the root cause of those problems to dismantle the structures and the systems that exist. And it goes right down to legislation and policy in order to make sure that we understand the impact and if we are to achieve outcomes such as Closing The Gap or the work that I am currently doing within the missing and murdered First Nations and women and children’s inquiry that is really important issue that we know it stemmed from institutionalised racism is I think it is an important conversation that we can have and it is one that I am particularly, passionate about. 7.03am BST The more things change… Australia will keep playing our part?

Rather than gambling $10bn on the stock and only spending some of the returns in a few years’ time, Labor should do what governments used to and invest billions of dollars now directly building public and affordable housing. Australia has the construction capacity to build 110,000 public and affordable homes over the next five years, it can afford the $5bn a year it would cost, all we need is the political will from the federal Labor government. With people sleeping in cars and tents because they can’t find an affordable home, and construction industry jobs at risk as private approvals collapse, it’s a no-brainer for the government to step in and invest billions of dollars now and build the public and affordable housing Australia so desperately needs.

Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP Updated at 7.37am BST 6.49am BST Poll respondents agree on need for sweeping changes in housing Minor parties on the left and right are taking heart from Guardian’s Essential Poll which found majority support for a range of drastic policies to tackle the housing crisis. The Greens housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, noted at a press conference earlier today there is 60% support for a rental freeze. In a statement One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, boasted about 59% support for capping migration to reduce demand for housing. Like the Coalition, One Nation also wants to allow use of super for housing. Hanson said: The housing and rental crisis is simple economics: too little supply and too high demand. Our policy increases supply and reduces demand. It makes sense, and it’s apparent the voters agree.” I’m sure that more housing can be built without bringing migration into it, but that is not where Peter Dutton and Hanson want the debate going.

Washington and its allies are concerned at Beijing’s security ambitions in the strategically located Pacific Islands region, after Beijing struck a security pact with Solomon Islands. PNG prime minister, James Marape, met with Australia’s defence minister, Richard Marles, on Monday on the sidelines of the Korea-Pacific Islands Summit in Seoul and discussed the “proposed bilateral security treaty”, Marape’s office said in a statement on Tuesday. It is a work in progress and requires the PNG side to consult our domestic processes and sovereign laws in relation to certain wordings and provisions,” the statement said. Marape had “conveyed his apologies to prime minister Anthony Albanese for the delay in formalising this proposed Treaty with Australia”, it added. Papua New Guinea's prime minister, James Marape.

The app will also better integrate the Qantas loyalty points program, communicate during disruptions and offer enhancements like fast check-in and more control over bookings, the company says. The airline announced the plan at its first investor strategy day since the pandemic, which focused on customer experience. After mishandled baggage rates soared last year as airlines returned to pre-Covid levels of operation, it believes the new feature will be welcome. Qantas Group chief executive Alan Joyce said: This is a structurally different business than it was before Covid, operating in markets that have also changed. New technology is central to our plan ... We’ll be able to serve our customers better, reduce our cost base through lower running costs and carve out some new competitive advantages. The Qantas announcement comes after Virgin became the first Australian airline to offer baggage tracking earlier this month. Passengers track their luggage through a smartphone app, which sends a push notification when their luggage has been received post check-in, as well as when it arrives at their destination. Virgin will expand the service to all flights between Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and the Gold Coast by the middle of the year. Updated at 7.25am BST 6.31am BST ADF chief pressed by Jacqui Lambie during Senate estimates The chief of the Australian Defence Force, Gen Angus Campbell, has told a Senate committee hearing that his own performance as a commander during the time the ADF was deployed in Afghanistan was considered as part of a recent review. Campbell, facing continued questioning from the Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie, declined to tell the committee precisely how many commanders faced the potential removal of honours or awards as a result of a recent review of command accountability stemming from the Brereton inquiry. During the committee hearing, Campbell told Lambie it was “a small number of persons who held command appointments during particular periods of operational service in Afghanistan”. I know that not only yourself but a range of other interested parties and the media are circling around this issue like great whites in a feeding frenzy and I would wish to decline to tell you the number so as to mitigate the enthusiasm with which these people are, quite frankly, hunted down by particularly the media looking for spectacle. Campbell made clear that the current process related to the accountability of a leader for the performance of those under their command - and was an administrative issue that should not be “conflated” with criminal allegations. Lambie asked him “where is your command accountability” for the time he was commander of Joint Task Force 633 (January 2011 to January 2012). Campbell said the approach was to review all rank levels and all time periods of service and then offer recommendations to the defence minister, Richard Marles. Campbell told the committee he was not afforded any “special circumstances” in that process: As a member of all of the commanders who were in Afghanistan at different times and in different circumstances, I was included in that review.

Mulino said the apparent unauthorised disclosure was of “grave concern” to him, and this may be a breach of privileges. He said the economics committee would investigate then report back to the house. So there’s no push to the privileges committee yet, but that’s a warning shot that Mulino and Labor think someone has leaked from the economics committee.

Chester: Will the hardwood timber [industry] receive direct support from your government? Albanese: This is a dry gully they are stuck in. Having come here and asked a question suggesting there is a misleading of parliament last Thursday, they are now asking us will intervene over decisions that as we said early on, were decisions of the Victorian government. Not a decision by us. Peter Dutton (Albanese has been on his feet for 30 seconds) Thank you very much. This was a very tight question. Given your recent and previous rulings. There is no wiggle room or the ability for the Prime Minister to have this outrage, he needs to answer the questions because it goes to his conduct in the chamber. Tony Burke: To the point of order, I am not sure how it goes to what the leader of the opposition just said because that was not in the question. What was in the question was a question about how money will be expanded on how the National be construction fund will be used. That is where it went. Milton Dick gets Albanese to continue: I refer the member to my answer of last Thursday that was accurate in every aspect. Included in that, I quote from last Thursday’s answer. The Victorian government has a $200m structural adjustment package in its budget. That is what I said last Thursday, that is the case today. What I have spoken about as well is our policy to provide support for the forestry sector through the National Reconstruction fund. Something those opposite seem completely oblivious to. They come in here and voted against it. They voted against it and then they say it is not broad enough. Dutton tries again with another point of order, but Dick says no. Albanese: Thanks Mr Speaker.

I stand by the national reconstruction fund. I stand by the $15bn for manufacturing. I stand by the $3bn for renewables and low emissions technology. I stand by the $1.5bn for medical manufacturing. I stand by the billion dollars evaluating resources... Chester tries to raise a point of order on relevance but Milton Dick has HAD ENOUGH and there is no point of order.

Updated at 6.24am BST 6.06am BST Greens senator David Shoebridge has written to state and federal attorneys general urging them to act on legal tactics being used to deny child abuse survivors the opportunity for justice. Guardian Australia has revealed, through 12 months of reporting and a major investigation published two months ago, that the Catholic church and other institutions are now routinely using the deaths of perpetrators to argue that survivors’ civil claims should be permanently stayed. Where granted, a permanent stay shuts down a case and shields the institution before it reaches trial. Shoebridge said he had written to the state and federal attorneys general urging them to reform the law that allows the tactic to be used, following an episode on the same subject by Four Corners on Monday night. The high court is set to decide upon the Catholic church’s use of a stay in one abuse case, that involving a woman known only as GLJ, in coming months. But many lawyers say reform will be needed regardless of what the high court decides. Shoebridge said: I’ve worked with survivors of child sexual abuse for more than 10 years and I’m still shocked by the brutal tactics of the institutions that failed to protect them then, and will do anything to avoid paying them compensation now. Institutions destroyed their own records, or deliberately refused to keep them, and this fact should never deny the children abused their right to go to court. The work of implementing the findings of the royal commission will never be done if organisations are allowed to use permanent stays to dent survivors fair compensation. The child abuse royal commission recommended institutions retain the ability to use stay applications in abuse cases, though critics say it could not have contemplated that they would be used in this fashion. Plaintiff lawyers also argue the way stays are being used conflicts with the intent of separate reforms designed to remove delay as a barrier to justice. Updated at 7.10am BST 6.06am BST Independent Fowler MP Dai Le wants to know about council funding and asks Anthony Albanese: What will the federal government do to ensure funding will be allocated properly to prioritise disadvantaged communities? Albanese: …The Member for Fowler is absolutely right to say that I am a supporter of local government. That is why just in the coming month, there will be every meeting of the Australian Council of Local Government where every single mayor and shire president will be meeting with the federal government including all of my ministers to make sure you get that direct engagement of all. I am a firm believer in need-based funding for local government and the grants commission make assessments based upon equity issues. I’m very conscious …an area such as Liverpool Council is a disadvantaged area. Therefore [it] should receive more support than some other areas that are in a stronger position to raise revenues themselves in their local communities. I am also aware in my view and this is something I have put for a long period of time, funding for local community infrastructure is best delivered through local government. Updated at 7.08am BST 5.58am BST Paul Fletcher has a question for Anthony Albanese: I refer to his answer last Thursday when he told the house that the national reconstruction fund is an example of how is government supports timber workers. Given the government did a deal to specifically exclude the native hardwood timber industry from accessing the fund, did the prime minister mislead parliament? Anthony Albanese: I am pleased to get that question. They voted against the national reconstruction fund. They voted against it. And in that, in the member’s question he just asked, are we supporting timber workers, you bet we are. You bet we are. And that is why we have, as part of the national reconstruction fund, $500 million for evaluating and in agriculture, fisheries, forestry food and fibre. That is why we have that. That is why we have that. The Victorian government have made a decision, they have made a decision to end native forest logging and that is a decision for them. What we are doing is making sure that we provide an avenue for increased investment, increased investment in forestry through the national reconstruction fund. That is very important because the member may be unaware that around 90% of our forest product now comes from plantation timber. We want to see more plantation forest and we want to see more jobs. We are investing $300m to grow plantations and modernised timber manufacturing and infrastructure. A bunch of interjections happen, Darren Chester is warned and then Fletcher has a point of order on relevance, which is not relevant. Albanese: According to those opposite there are no timber workers in the sustainable forestry industry. That would be news to the suppliers at Visy and the workers in Tumbarumba, all those who work in the industry. We on this side of the chamber brought forward a fund, a fund of $15bn and those opposite, of course, voted against it. But they vote against everything. They do not like being called the “No-alition” so I won’t do that but they vote no to everything including the national reconstruction fund. Fin.

We move on to a dixer for Tanya Plibersek and Milton Dick has to call for quiet again because there are so many groans from the opposition. Dick: When questions are being asked to ministers, I have been through this many times. It is not a time to groan, to give comments. It is to be in silence so I can hear the question. For some reason when certain ministers are asked, there is always an audible groan. It is not going to continue. Otherwise I will take action. This happened with Clare O’Neil and Anika Wells as well. What. Could. The. Common. Thread. Be *thinking face emoji* Labor MPs Marion Scrymgour and Ged Kearney seem to note the same thing – that when female ministers are asked questions, there are groans. Updated at 5.53am BST 5.44am BST The Liberal MP for Flinders Zoe McKenzie asks: Under the government price increase announced last week, the average Victorian will pay a further 25% more on energy or $532 more for residential customer. Why are the prime minister’s broken promises making things so much worse for middle Australia? Chris Bowen takes this one. There is quite a bit of old ground covered – the Coalition didn’t vote for the market intervention and then get to Angus Taylor hiding power price increases until after the 2022 election Why did he do that? I think the other is obvious because he was embarrassed because he was ashamed. Now he says, “It is not my fault. He signed the regulation. There are two signatures. Peter Dutton then pushes Milton Dick: It is on relevance. Australians are hurting at the moment and this minister is trying to tell them the power bills are going down when they know they are going up and up and up. Dick warns Dutton he is running out of leeway. Bowen finishes with: The DMO [default market offer] last week was issued in accordance with the law. Not the law that was changed by the side of the house but the law that was signed by the previous minister only two signatures. His own and governor general. We don’t blame the governor general because we blame the previous minister. That is the fact. They … were not honest with the Australian people, we have been clear with the Australian people that energy prices are under pressure around the world for around the world are intervening including this government and we are intervening against the wishes of those opposite. Updated at 5.50am BST 5.39am BST Back to QT and the Nationals Darren Chester asks Anthony Albanese: I refer to an answer in Question Time last Thursday when he said and I quote, “Through the National Reconstruction fund, we specifically set aside funding to support the forestry industry.” Prime Minister, how does the National Reconstruction fund support timber workers and their families and the native hardwood timber industry? (Now, the Coalition voted against the national reconstruction fund. But much like the temporary energy caps, which the Coalition also voted against, it says no and then it moans. Labor had, what our political editor Katherine Murphy used to call ‘bitch and fold’ – where the then Labor opposition would talk about all the issues with a piece of legislation (national security, stage three tax cuts etc) and then vote for it. The Coalition is saying no to legislation more often than not, but then moans about the legislation not going far enough.) Industry minister Ed Husic takes this one. We want to see manufacturing jobs growth. Particularly in our region. It is why in the Reconstruction fund, which we are very happy to get a question on, would be great to get your support for, we wanted in particular to support a value in resources and in agriculture in particular. And within agriculture, we targeted forestry products. We did want to provide for value in those products. Chester has a point of order that is not a point of order and Husic continues: It is a bit rich for them to suddenly come here and asked what the reconstruction fund will be able to do for regional communities and they never ever backed the fund. Never prepared to back manufacturing and were not prepared to engage in this. We will be able either from a variety of different sources, either native hardwood or through the plantation, if there are products where we want to be able to value, and those products here on short, we want support that. It would have been nice to get their support, instead they want to be able to do what they always do, say no, do nothing and criticise at the end. To this, Peter Dutton says: ‘sounds like a noodle nation arrangement’ Dan Dan noodles?

Fraud’s been a terrible problem within the national disability insurance scheme. Officials took questions about the details on notice. On a lighter note, Liberal senator Anne Ruston started quoting the Australian Council of Social Service chief, Cassandra Goldie, talking about the increase to the rate of JobSeeker and the prospect of more than a million still living in poverty. “God forbid,” she said of her venture into progressive politics. Labor senator Don Farrell said it was “no surprise” when he was quizzed on the same topic by Greens senator Janet Rice. It is a bit of a surprise the Coalition would ask me these questions .. after your nine years of neglect,” he said. Cue a sigh from Ruston that sounded like it came with an eyeroll. 5.32am BST Anthony Albanese continues: Mr Speaker, this is the paradox of the shadow treasurer. He’s lightweight, but dense. The fact is, the fact is that when you look at Australia’s performance, he asked about inflation, well, he should know. Because the CPI jumped 21% in the March 2020 two quarters. On his watch. The largest quarterly raise this century. This century. The notable price rises in the quarter included automotive fuel, 11%, beef, 7.6, vegetable 6.6, fruit, 4.9 and nondurable grocery product 6.7. That is what occurred.

Milton Dick says the prime minister COULD NOT BE MORE RELEVANT and Albanese gets to continue: In the 12 months to March quarter 2023 the shadow treasurer likes to talk about the G7 and things we are a member [we are not] But when you have a look at what the G7 countries and you compare us with them, the fact is I am asked about food and at the G7 countries, this is where there. Canada, 10.5. France, 15.6. Germany, 20. Italy, 13, UK, 18.1. The United States, 9.9. Every single one of those countries has higher, higher food inflation. You cannot be more specific than this. In Australia, in every single one, Australia’s performance has been better and I note that at the National Press Club, the shadow treasurer was asked why was inflation something that was out of the Coalition ‘s control that is now, as you say, able to be controlled by labour men, especially given the war in Ukraine is still going. What was his answer? That said it all. Well, the key to answering that question is that we are not in government, Labor is now. That says it all about this lightweight shadow treasurer. Updated at 6.09am BST 5.28am BST Angus Taylor has a question for Anthony Albanese and Labor can’t even be bothered with keeping its running joke of groaning, because it is not to the treasurer. Taylor: My question is to the prime minister. UBS Data shows that in the last month alone the price of Vegemite has increased by 8%, peanut butter by 9%, yoghurt has increased by 12%. Having promised to take responsibility, will the prime minister apologise to Australians for failing take pressure off inflation, leading Australians to pay more at the checkout? Milton Dick asks him to repeat it because there is so much heckling on both sides he couldn’t hear the question. Taylor does so. Happily. Albanese: I thank the Shadow Treasurer for the question. He seems incapable of asking a question of the Treasurer and of course, of course they spent their budget estimates last week asking the big questions about what T-shirts people were wearing and….

There is forced laughter from Michael Sukkar. Tony Pasin says “don’t worry they’ll fix it with fundraising dinners”. Jason Wood is also grumbling. Updated at 5.25am BST 5.21am BST Clare O’Neil: Can I genuinely thank the member for Mackellar for this question? She is right there are some absolutely terrible things that we inherited in the immigration system and there is a large volume of work occurring on this matter at the moment. If I could give the parliament a little context, we arrived in government one year ago to find the immigration system in an absolute mess. We had 1 million unprocessed visas in the system, we had an explosion of low-wage temp remote migration that we saw under the member of the opposition when he was running the portfolio, and as the member points out, we had clear evidence that the system was being used to facilitate terrible crimes, terrible crimes that I don’t think anyone in this parliament would defend. The worst of those were instances of human trafficking and sexual exploitation in the broken migration system was at the heart of those crimes being committed. Right under the nose of the leader of opposition who sits opposite me. There is an enormous amount of work under way to address these concerns and it was not just the Nixon review all they will speak to that in a second. We asked Australian Border Force to stand up a new task force to address some of these issues, operation Inglenook, and that has been enormously successful. They have done somewhere just over 50 major disruptions of incidents where they believe that some of these issues are present in Australia at the moment. They have stopped people at the border and cancelled visas, they have dealt with a number of very shoddy migration agents so there has been very good practical action. Of course, the system itself has facilitated this and that is why I ask Christine Nixon, the toughest cop that works in Victoria to look at this review. I would like to acknowledge her work. It has very much been of assistance to the government and you can hear how we’re going to address these issues. The government is considering the review at the moment and we will release the review and government’s response that review shortly. I am very happy to speak to the member in private, before the review was released, and afterwards to talk to her about some of these very important issues facing Australia. Updated at 5.24am BST 5.20am BST Independent MP for Mackellar, Dr Sophie Scamps asks: Last year, Victoria Police commissioner Christine Nixon was commissioned to investigate Australia’s migration system. In your own words, the system is currently being used to facilitate some of the worst crimes that can be conducted such as human trafficking and sex slavery. It was promised this report will be made public before the last budget. My question is why hasn’t the report released publicly yet and when will it be released? Which coincidentally, is a question a reader had asked us to ask as part of Guardian reader’s QT. So we can get this answer a little earlier.

On 97 occasions before the last election, the prime minister promised to reduce every Australian power bill by $275. But the government’s own budget papers say power prices will rise by 10% and last week, the energy regulator said on 1 July prices were wise by as much as 25%. Prime minister, how on earth can power prices rise by 25% but fall by $275. (screams into the abyss) You already know what Anthony Albanese says: I note the member voted against energy price bill relief. Voted against it. In this chamber. In this chamber. I note also if you compare what we have predicted to be the price rises in the October budget and compare it with our budget papers, you will see our action in putting price caps call on gas, energy has made a substantial difference. That is what the experts will say. I am asked about cheaper energy and I have seen a proposal for cheaper energy. I can inform the house I have seen a proposal for free electricity. Free. Because the Member for New England had to say this about nuclear power. How about we do this? Because the Member for Hinkler came in. And he said this. In my view, and as they go to a community that supports it. Because we know the big problem is they had this policy and under the Leader of the Opposition has problems with costings policy but there is a costing here. Ley goes to interject with a point of order that is not a point of order and we all lose some more precious minutes from our lives.

Yesterday afternoon I visited a manufacturer in the Yarra Valley that have seen their energy bill skyrocket by $200,000 since Labor came to office. This is why Australians are paying more at the checkout. Given none of the energy bill relief and has not gone to a single small business or family, why is Labor ignoring the suffering caused of the ongoing cost-of-living crisis? I think you know what the answer is. Anthony Albanese: It is indeed the one-year anniversary of the member for Hume’s [Angus Taylor] decision to hide price rises. You actively hid high prices, we acted to shield families from them. And you voted against it. You voted against it. You voted against shielding families.

Updated at 4.58am BST 4.27am BST Hecs/Help indexing negating wage increases due to indexation You are always told that Hecs/Help is an interest free loan. But governments never want to talk about how it is indexed. And that raising it to inflation when inflation is high can add years to how long it takes you to pay off. And when your pay packet is being docked in extra tax to meet that bill, it matters, because your wage is going backwards. Any payrise is usually negated by the increased tax you are paying. Which influences what decisions you make about whether or not you can afford to buy a home, start a family – even where you live. So yes, it matters. This year HECS/HELP indexation will rise faster than the average home loan & nearly double that of wages growth. Younger generations are already struggling with cost of living & housing crisis.

But we can’t claim to be fiscally responsible while also not knowing the circumstances that we will face in three years’ time. That schools tax is opening up a new front. It’s crossing a precipice that we are not prepared to cross. Updated at 4.36am BST 4.17am BST Pesutto confirms opposition will vote against new taxes in Victorian budget The Victorian opposition leader, John Pesutto, has confirmed the Coalition will vote against new taxes in the state budget. Speaking in his party room on Tuesday, he said the opposition has also committed to repealing the introduction of the payroll tax for private schools if they are elected in 2026. Pesutto says: We don’t believe Victorians who work hard and send their kids to independent schools should be punished for the financial incompetence of the Andrews government … The reason we have singled out, at this stage, the schools tax as a tax we committed to repealing in government after 2026, is that for a long time and historically we’ve always left independent schools untouched by payroll tax because we don’t think it’s fair, and generations before us have never considered it fair. The shadow treasurer, Brad Rowswell also announced if elected they would introduce a legislated debt cap: We’re not ready to say what that state debt cap level will be, because chances are over the next three-and-a-half years the economic circumstances state will change. But together with ratings agencies, in consultation with them and other financial institutions in this state, we will have more to say about that before the next election. The budget, handed down last week, details a “Covid debt repayment plan” to bring the state’s borrowings – set to total $171.4bn by 2026/27 – under control. It includes two new 10-year levies on property investors and big business, which will raise $8.6bn over the next four years. Payroll tax exemptions for about 110 “high-fee” private schools is also expected to deliver an additional $422.2m in government revenue.

Lambie foreshadowed the possible disruption to Senate proceedings during a tense exchange with the chief of the Australian defence force, Gen Angus Campbell, in an estimates committee hearing today. During the hearing, Lambie suggested that up to 24 letters had been sent by Campbell in recent months “asking them to give their medals back”. Campbell did not confirm exactly how many letters may have been sent – he said he did not agree with the number – but it was a “very serious” and complex matter. He noted that the Brereton inquiry had recommended that a review be undertaken into decorations afforded to people in certain command positions. Lambie replied to Campbell: I don’t think it’s going to come down to you to release those letters, because I’m going to fight you every single step of the way. It’s even going to get worse for the Senate when I stop it every hour for two weeks straight until I get those letters redacted with the names [removed from] them. Campbell said he would not release those letters “unless directed otherwise by the government”. He said this was “for the integrity of the process and for the privacy of the individuals”. Lambie shot back: The only integrity right now is your integrity which is right up there on the Richter scale, I can assure you. So I’m asking once again: minister, when are those letters going to arrive here? Or we’re going to have a hard few weeks in that senate, I can assure you. We can stop it every hour, every morning. The Labor senator Jenny McAllister, who was representing the defence minister at the hearing, said the government would take the matter on notice. McAllister said the government would consider Campbell’s advice and the matters Lambie had raised, and come to a decision about what information could be provided.

We must point out, though, that the reason the no campaign doesn’t have DGR status is because they withdrew the application – literally the day before it was granted that status in the budget. The no campaign withdrew the application and said it would put in another application because the two major organisations are merging. But DGR status for the voice no case committee is literally listed in the budget papers, after being granted by the government. Related: Budget allocates millions to support Indigenous mental health through voice campaign Staying on the referendum, the Liberals have identified a group of MPs who will vote against the bill – even as the party itself backs the bill in principle. This, as we’ve reported before, comes down to a legislative quirk where only those MPs who vote against the alteration bill can have input into the referendum pamphlet sent to all homes. So because the Liberals will let the referendum occur, even though they oppose the referendum, they wouldn’t be able to help write the pamphlet – unless some MPs oppose the bill. So the Liberal whips oversaw a process to choose some MPs to vote no. We don’t know who they are, and have asked the whips office for more information.

Related: Legal quirk could force some opposition MPs to vote against holding Indigenous voice referendum In the Coalition partyroom meeting today, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, also chided the Labor government for “chasing aspirational people with wealth”. The opposition meeting focused largely on cost of living and energy concerns, with Dutton telling the room that Australian families were struggling. He told his troops that the opposition needed to show “empathy” for those struggles, but to also put the blame for those issues on decisions made by the Albanese government. Dutton raised concerns about rising prices for energy, transport and storage being passed on to consumers at supermarkets. The opposition also claimed the government was “chasing” the wealthy, pointing to investment properties or other assets. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, praised the “unity” in the Coalition and claimed the government was focused on “niche social issues”. He said the Coalition should continue to prosecute Labor for alleged “broken promises”, pointing to energy and cost of living concerns. In questions to the leadership, several Coalition MPs claimed the government was neglecting the regions in regards to infrastructure spending, while two others brought up “faith-based” concerns – one on schools, critical of government delays on the Law Reform Commission report into discrimination at religious schools, and the other critical of the takeover of the Calvary hospital in Canberra.

And yes, I have experienced racism in the Greens … So I want to be clear that racism is systemic in this country and it has to be stamped out and eradicated at every single level and that does include the Greens.

Contracts within the public service are different – some are there because of public servant caps and are brought in for particular projects, or because of the skills which are needed for a time. Cash says it is hypocritical. From her release: It is extraordinary that the Minister’s own Department is not leading by example.’ Mr Burke wants to impose new laws on the private sector but his own Department can’t even say if they will apply to themselves. Certainly, at the moment his own Department is not working by the principles that he espouses. They don’t pay contractors the same as public servants. The hypocrisy of this Minister knows no bounds. 3.11am BST Keeping stage-three tax cuts ‘a matter of trust’, says Don Farrell If you wound back time, you might not have the $313bn stage-three tax cuts, Labor senator Don Farrell has told estimates. But the government remains committed to them, he said, and it’s “not just politics”. The independent senator David Pocock asked him about the need to balance the economy, and whether the cuts were “economically responsible”. Farrell said: If you could wind back time, well then maybe you would never have had these tax cuts, but the reality is they were passed by previous parliaments, they are currently the law of the land. We went to the election saying that we would not reverse them. And, and I think … as a matter of trust between the Australian people and the government then we have to do what we said we were going to do, and that’s, I think has been a hallmark of this prime minister. If he’s said he’s going to do something then he will.

Updated at 3.11am BST 2.48am BST Tradie platform Hipages’ automatic subscription renewal likely in breach of consumer law Tradie platform Hipages has admitted it was likely in breach of Australian consumer law over failing to adequately disclose contract terms allowing automatic subscription renewals and early termination fee charges between October 2018 and January 2022. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said Hipages had agreed with an undertaking to clearly disclose its subscription renewal and cancellation policies in telephone scripts and email communications. ACCC deputy chair, Mick Keogh, said: Many subscribers were unaware that they had to specifically opt out of Hipages’ automatic 12-month renewal, and that there was only a very short cooling off period in which they could avoid paying an early termination fee. When some people attempted to cancel their auto-renewed contracts, they were told they would have to pay out the full 12-month term. The ACCC has long called for powers to take on unfair contract terms and fight back against online subscription traps. The federal government has indicated it is interested in regulating in this area. Updated at 2.54am BST 2.43am BST Defence officials have revealed they are looking for another $1.8bn in savings as they prepare a new national defence strategy. Drilling down into the budget documents is a core part of the Senate estimates committee process – and the Coalition has extracted a confirmation that the search for cost-shuffles within Defence is not yet finished. Officials said they had already found about $6bn of savings – but the target is $7.8bn, leaving a gap of $1.8bn over the initial four-year budget period. The vice-chief of the Australian defence force, Vice Admiral David Johnston, said: The additional $1.8bn – we will reprioritise as we do the work of returning with the national defence strategy over this next few months. That new national defence strategy is due to be released in 2024. Simon Birmingham, a former finance minister, had been chasing details of the $19bn in funding required over the four-yet budget period to cover the government’s six priorities in the defence strategic review. This commitment always said to be budget-neutral over the first four years, meaning it would come from a combination of savings and existing allocations. Tom Hamilton, a deputy secretary of the Department of Defence, said: That $19bn included around $12bn of funding that was already allocated to those six priorities. The residual funding – the government directed that Defence identify lower priority activities from within the defence budget that would be redirected to these new priorities better suited to our strategic circumstances. Birmingham replied: Thanks, Mr Hamilton. I think that was a way of saying ‘none’ in terms of the $19bn, none of it is additional funding that is new flowing into Defence. Updated at 2.52am BST 2.29am BST PwC team auditing Treasury not involved in tax scandal, officials say Earlier, Treasury officials answered questions about a PwC contract for $985,000 for auditing and governance oversight of Treasury. Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy said that in the delivery of that contract, Treasury had “no cause for concern”. But he said Nick McKim’s point is “well made and understood about broader public perception of the company”. He said Treasury would consider “carefully” whether to renew the contract when it’s up at the end of the year, but didn’t want to impose “financial consequences” (by cancelling it early). Officials said Treasury had “sought and received assurance that no members of our internal audit team were involved in the tax practitioners board matter”. The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, said PwC’s conduct on the tax practitioner board matter was “outrageous” but it “was not a breach of procurement”. She said: I know people would like us to go around cancelling existing contracts, that’s not available without significant financial risks. Updated at 2.51am BST 2.26am BST Reynolds says Labor answer in estimates ‘sounds like it was written by … a smart-arse year 12 political student’ Much of this morning’s social services Senate estimates have been consumed with alleged smart-arsery. The Liberal senator Linda Reynolds asked the minister for the national disability insurance scheme, Bill Shorten, a question about fraud within the NDIS, and got back a bit of waffle that, frankly, most journalists have come to expect as answers to questions. But Reynolds is not so used to non-answers, from the sounds of it. She’s asking senator Don Farrell (who’s representing the government in the estimates hearing) if he would have written something like that: I mean, that sounds like it was written by you know, a smart-arse year 12 political student. This is, I think, a two fingered salute to every NDIS participant who was concerned about fraud. The other theme this morning is the inadequacy of jobseeker – the Greens senator Janet Rice is trying to get Farrell to say it’s not enough. He is resisting.

Albanese said he had made 12 visits to WA so far, and the WA MPs were a “huge strength for us”. Albanese said he believed that at the next election Labor “will also be targeting Canning and Moore” – the WA seats currently held by Andrew Hastie and Ian Goodenough.

The party room meetings are breaking up – we will bring you those updates again soon. In case you are not a regular Politics Live follower, or have forgotten, there is a briefing after each party room meeting, given by a nominated MP, who reads from the minutes. They give a brief rundown of the legislation discussed, what the leaders said and what the themes were, and then give brief details about questions backbenchers may have asked. That part is all de-identified “a MP asked about” and it is up to journalists to work out who. It is all treated as background, which means you can’t attribute it to the MP who is giving the briefing, but it is why you see “party room sources” so often, and why we all have basically the same detail. No, I don’t know how it started and I was surprised to see how it worked when I arrived in the press gallery, but I think some of these things need to be demystified. Updated at 1.51am BST 1.31am BST The budget is not inflationary, Kennedy maintains Liberal senator Dean Smith foreshadows he will be pushing Steven Kennedy to explain how the government’s budget is not inflationary. He wants to talk about “vulnerabilities”. It’s a statement, not a question, and it is all part of the Coalition’s plan to paint the government as being responsible for the cost-of-living crisis. Kennedy says he does not believe the budget as a whole is inflationary or adding to inflationary pressures and says the crucial difference here, is time – it is spread across the course of the year. In terms of the overall contribution to – is this substantially moving aggregate demand and leading us to revise up our inflationary numbers … the answer is no. Updated at 1.49am BST 1.28am BST Treasury explains what it knew when about PwC Diane Brown, Treasury’s revenue deputy secretary, noted that the department had already provided an answer to a question on notice about what it knew when on the PwC. It said: In September 2018 Treasury was asked to provide information to the Australian Taxation Office about a possible breach of confidentiality in relation to the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law. In late 2020, the [Tax Practitioner Board] made enquiries with Treasury regarding information relevant to TPB investigations. There were further discussions with the TPB in 2021 and 2022 and Treasury was made aware of the outcome of the TPB’s investigation in relation to Mr Collins in December 2022. Brown said the ATO was “seeking information on PwC and their involvement” in tax avoidance consultation “for the purposes of an inquiry into the conduct of Mr [John] Collins”. We weren’t told a wider context. Treasury was asked for a copy of the confidentiality agreements Collins signed. But Brown explained that as Treasury assisted the ATO with its investigations, the ATO was subject to secrecy provisions and was not able to explain what it was investigating. Brown took on notice whether the treasurer was informed at the time. I don’t believe the treasurer was told. Updated at 1.48am BST 1.21am BST The current economy is not like the GFC or Covid dips, Treasury says Back to Steven Kennedy for a moment – another key difference between the economy now and what happened in the GFC and Covid? The tax system is taking more money out of the economy because unemployment is so low and people are working more. So while tax revenues collapsed during the GFC and Covid, it has increased here. Updated at 1.47am BST 1.19am BST Shoebridge asks if defence has tried to ‘test the integrity’ of PwC relationship The Greens senator David Shoebridge has asked what work has been done, since the PwC scandal broke, to “test the integrity” of the relationship between Defence and the consulting firm. The associate secretary of the Department of Defence, Matt Yannopoulos, told the Senate foreign affairs, defence and trade committee hearing: We have identified all of the active contracts with PwC and attained assurance from them, most recently again yesterday to the secretary from the CEO, and to myself from the defence lead partner, that over the last 10 years of work that PriceWaterhouseCoopers has done for defence none of the individuals named have ever done any work fordefence. Shoebridge wanted clarity about which individuals. Yannopoulos indicated that the assurance included the 54 individuals whose names have not been publicly released. Updated at 1.46am BST 1.19am BST Are the welfare increases inflationary? Treasury estimates has moved on to Liberal senator Dean Smith, who is asking Steven Kennedy about who tends to spend more – people on low incomes, or high incomes. (He knows the answer is low incomes. Smith has been tasked to get evidence that the very modest increase to welfare payments are stimulatory as part of the Coalition’s budget attacks) Kennedy is going through the differences between the payments given during the global financial crisis and what is happening now. He says the support given during the GFC was all at once (in the same quarter) and went to most of the population. The difference with the cost-of-living package now, Kennedy says, is that the package is spread out across the year and it is a smaller number in terms of spend against GFC or Covid package. It’s about “size and design” Kennedy says. So not as much money, being spread out across the year = not inflationary. Updated at 1.44am BST 1.10am BST Defence reveals $223m in PwC contracts Defence officials have just revealed that Defence currently has 54 current contracts with PwC with a total contact value of about $223m.

Updated at 1.15am BST 1.09am BST Albanese cites cost-of-living measures when asked about voice cost to taxpayers It was Adelaide radio day for the prime minister – he also spoke to FiveAAA, a station he has a long relationship with. He was asked about a message from a listener on why taxpayer money was going to the voice, given the cost-of-living crisis: Q: Good morning. Question for the PM, my mortgage has just risen again to two-thirds of my income, energy prices in my home are increasing by up to 25%. My daughter had to bid over against 40 other people to get a rental. Yet you continue to argue for the allocation of public money to the voice, which is about number 5,000 on my list of priorities at the moment. What do you say to people like Martin? Because there’s more of them out there than the yes camp is aware of. Albanese: What I say to Martin is that we are concentrating on matters that affect him. We just handed down a budget that will give energy price relief. We are trying to get legislation through the Senate that will have an impact on housing, through our Housing Australia Future Fund, but we had other legislation as part of the budget as well – rental relief for people in the private sector. We had increased funding for community housing. We had in the budget, following on from our cheaper medicines policy that came in on January 1, further measures that will reduce the cost of medicines by September 30 … cheaper childcare comes in on July 1. We’re doing all of those things that affect a vast number of Australians. But at the same time, yes, we are going to give the Australian people the opportunity to vote on something that overwhelmingly will not have a direct impact on most Australians. But it just might make a positive difference for some of the most disadvantaged Australians … And this, I think, is something that is within the Australian ethos of the fair go. And I understand that many people are doing it tough. And that’s why we introduced those measures in the budget. And that’s why we’ll continue to work each and every day on the full range of issues. That’s why in health, in order to give people access to bulk-billing, the last time I was in Adelaide I was in a medical centre in the northern suburbs of Adelaide, in the electorate of Spence around Elizabeth, talking about our tripling of the bulk-billing incentive. That, at that medical centre, will make an enormous difference for people, speaking to the doctors and the people on the ground there. Updated at 1.14am BST 1.06am BST Coalition argues Labor is not allocating defence enough in the next four years The Coalition’s line of attack, during defence estimates, is to suggest the lack of new funding for defence over the first four years shows the Albanese government isn’t responding to the strategic circumstances with the urgency required. There is a lot of back and forth between the opposition and defence officials about this (the government has cut or scaled back some projects in order to fund other priorities, but says defence funding will increase overall in the medium to long term). The secretary of the Department of Defence, Greg Moriarty, gives the clearest answer: We rely on the funding envelope that the government sets for us. Updated at 1.15am BST 1.00am BST Treasury secretary: PwC emails 'disturbing' Labor senator Deb O’Neill is asking treasury officials about 144 pages of PwC emails, including one in which Peter Collins said there was “little chance of an anti-hybrid rule” because the board of taxation had “little real idea”. Several of the emails, which she read into Hansard, referred to the fact Treasury consultations were “supposed to be secret” or “confidential” - although one noted that global partners “may have a copy from other sources”. The Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, said: By any community standard you could say they’re clearly disturbing. They are relevant to our considerations. Having appeared in many Senate committees, may I say the Senate has done a very good job in exposing these issues. [Emails tabled on] 2nd May were a crucial piece of information, which allowed us to take a step. They were important to our consideration referring the matter [to the Australian federal police].” Kennedy confirmed Treasury didn’t have the emails until the Senate economics committee made them public. We’re now going through a timeline given by revenue deputy secretary Diane Brown. Updated at 2.57am BST 12.59am BST Campbell says China’s military buildup is concerning because it is not transparent Gen Campbell is also asked about China’s military buildup more generally. Campbell gives some figures, including that the PLA navy now had about 355 ships and 58 submarines. He said this has grown since the turn of century from a force of 210 ships, while there are estimates that it could have about 440 ships by 2030. Campbell says there has been a “very significant change in scale” and “in technological sophistication”. He says that in some areas, such as hypersonic weapons, China’s work is “extremely advanced”. He explains: Australia does not critique any country from seeking its defence and from preparing tis military for such purposes. The scale of that capability is going to vary subject to the resources and capacities and the security interests of each nation. But where that scale is large, there is also a concomitant responsibility to offer the level of transparency, assurance and reassure abut the intended purpose of that capability. And I think that is where we see there has been some critique of an absence of transparency and of assurance to the region with regard to the scale and intent of that build up that you spoke of. Updated at 1.17am BST 12.59am BST China seeking to ‘squeeze’ Taiwan, ADF chief says The chief of the Australian defence force, Gen Angus Campbell, says China’s People’s Liberation Army has carried out exercises that appear designed to “squeeze” the government and people of Taiwan. Campbell is giving evidence at Senate estimates this morning. In response to questions about Taiwan, the self-governed democracy of 24 million people that China claims as a wayward province and has not ruled out taking by force, Campbell says: China has in recent years undertaken a range of very substantial exercise activities or posturing activities that in some of those exercises centre on the island of Taiwan and could reasonably be regarded as seeking to pressure Taiwan or to squeeze the government of Taiwan in terms of its sense of its development and the aspirations of the people of Taiwan. Now, of course Australia is committed to the One China policy but the manner in which some of those exercises have been undertaken can increase regional tensions particularly between the island of Taiwan and the People’s Liberation Army in those exercises. We would not wish to see issues being resolved through either conflict or miscalculation and misadventure but rather than by considered diplomatic engagement and a peaceful resolution of disputes. 12.57am BST Hearings made Treasury aware of PwC documents, secretary says Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy has praised the Senate committee for their handling of the PwC matter and says that it has assisted in informing Treasury of the extent of what went on, particularly when it came to being made aware of documents.

Updated at 1.19am BST 12.54am BST Economics estimates turns to PwC In economics estimates, Labor senator Deborah O’Neill and Greens senator David Shoebridge have asking Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy about the PwC matter now. But all are having to be careful in their comments because of the investigations which are under way. Updated at 1.19am BST 12.45am BST Albanese explains the ‘Chicken Littles’ reference So what did Anthony Albanese mean by referring to the “Chicken Littles” in his Lowitja O’Donoghue oration overnight? I meant the idea that the sky would fall in – the great Chicken Little story which is there. The truth is that people, before the apology [to the stolen generations], many said that this would lead to catastrophic consequences, that it would change our whole system of government and that we would be more divided because of it. And what I saw on that day in 2008 was a moment of national unity. And now does anyone say that it was a bad idea? In the Mabo decision, when the Wik decision was handed down, I remember ads being circulated showing that people were going to lose their backyards. Now, none of that eventuated. Now, the proposal that will be put forward in the last quarter of this year is a very simple one. It gives recognition to the first peoples of Australia and recognises them, just as constitutions around the world have recognised their first peoples. Australia hasn’t: it stands out as the only developed nation in the world that arose from, had a colony as its past that didn’t recognise that. And secondly, it’s about listening. It’s about providing an opportunity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to express their views on matters that affect them. It’s not binding, it’s not a funding body, it won’t override parliament, it won’t change our system of government, it won’t impact the day to day lives of the overwhelming majority of your listeners. But it just might make the lives of some of our most disadvantaged people, our first peoples, that much better. Updated at 1.21am BST 12.43am BST Albanese says it’s important protesters stop ‘completely alienating people from their causes’ Back to Anthony Albanese and his interview with ABC radio Adelaide, the prime minister used climate protesters throwing paint on the glass which protects art works as justification for why people are pushing for these sorts of laws. Again, none of the art works have been damaged. I have every faith that Peter Malinauskas will act responsibly. We have seen emerge in recent times, I’ve got to say, when I see depictions of people throwing food and paint and various things, smearing great works of art for example, I just shake my head and think, I’m not quite sure how that that assists the cause which the advocates are pushing. And certainly, always, people have got to bear that in mind of how they bring people with them. It is, of course, important that people be able to express their views. But it’s important at the same time that they don’t endanger emergency service personnel, that they don’t disrupt in a way that completely alienates people from their causes. Uh huh. Perhaps Merle Thornton and Rosalie Bogner should have rethought chaining themselves to the Regatta Bar, because it alienated so many people against equal rights. The Cummeragunja walk-off probably alienated people too. Charlie Perkins might have been better off writing some strongly worded letters. (I think you get the point.) Updated at 1.25am BST 12.36am BST Horror weekend on Victoria’s roads The Victorian police minister, Anthony Carbines, is speaking to reporters outside parliament about the horror weekend on the state’s roads. There were nine fatalities, including three teenagers and a woman in her 30s in a single-vehicle crash on Saturday in regional Victoria. He said: What we need drivers to do is to respect the roads. Pay attention and get back to basics: wearing your seatbelt, obey the speed limit, no phones. What we’ve seen across the weekend, and across many other days now has been lives needlessly lost and families broken up and destroyed by road trauma. We’re seeing this across other jurisdictions, as well, which is not unique to Victoria. Also in my conversations with Victoria police, they’re briefed also, that in large part it’s not road conditions. It’s single vehicles into stationary objects, particularly in regional Victoria. While investigations will follow their course, what we’re finding really isn’t speed. It’s not wearing seatbelts, and it’s distracted driving using their phones and other devices. Updated at 1.27am BST 12.36am BST Budget deficit shrinking as proportion of GDP at record rate, estimates told Steven Kennedy has also discussed the rapidly improving budget bottom line. He said: From 2021-22 as a proportion of GDP, the budget deficit contracted 5%. This is a record contraction. From 2021-22 to 2022-23 the budget deficit is forecast to contract by 1.5%. This is the largest two-year contraction on record.” Kennedy said this will flow through to a “significantly” improved outlook in the medium term, with the underlying cash deficit narrowing from 1.3% in 2025-26 to just under 0.5% in 2032-33, compared with 1.9% projected in October. It won’t quite fit on a bumper sticker, but Labor will shout this from the rooftops. Updated at 1.29am BST 12.35am BST Treasury estimates advice will be ‘careful’ so as to not prejudice PwC investigations Steven Kennedy has now addressed the PwC scandal. He said: I’ll conclude with some brief comments on the PwC matter. The tax practitioner board investigated Mr [Peter] Collins from PwC and found that he failed to act with integrity, as required under his professional, ethical, and legal obligations and terminated his tax agent registration for a period of two years. In addition, the tax practitioners board ordered PwC to take steps to ensure it manages conflicts of interest appropriately. The Tax Practitioners Board published these findings and actions in January 2023. The Tax Practitioners Board’s tabling of emails in parliament on the 2nd of May 2023, which were uncovered during its investigation, has highlighted this significant extent of the unauthorised disclosure of confidential commonwealth information and the wide range of individuals within PwC who were directly and indirectly privy to the confidential information. In the light of these recent revelations and the seriousness of this misconduct, Treasury referred the matter to the Australian federal police to consider commencement of a criminal investigation … Treasury is not able to comment further on the AFP referral or on the specifics of any other potential action so as to not prejudice those options. Evidence that we give today will be careful to avoid prejudicing any police investigation. Updated at 1.42am BST 12.34am BST Albanese walks both sides of protest laws debate Anthony Albanese spoke to ABC radio Adelaide this morning where he tried to walk both sides of the South Australian protest laws debate. In case you missed it, the SA Labor government adopted a bill drafted by the Liberal opposition to massively increase the penalties for peaceful protests, if they disrupt the public. It is being rushed through the parliament. Now, putting aside the fact that protests are SUPPOSED to disrupt things – that is the whole point – the legislation follows a worrying trend across state (Labor) governments to adopt anti-protest measures. Under the SA legislation, “wilfully” obstructing a public place is being changed to “intentionally or recklessly” obstructing a public place. That gives police a lot more discretion in charging people for attending peaceful protests, or even for just existing – homeless people, or someone having a mental health episode in a public space which obstructs someone could be caught up in these laws as well. Fines are being increased to $50,000 and/or a prison sentence under the proposal which has the support of both the major parties in South Australia. Unions, who know something about disruptive protests to create change are outraged. Asked about it on radio this morning, Albanese tried to walk both sides of the argument. Of course, free speech is important. But it’s also important to exercise responsibility as well. And some of the depiction of shutting down a whole city in a dangerous way can be an issue, and it doesn’t actually help the cause either. I have marched many a time, as have, I’m sure, most members of political parties. It’s important that people be able to express their views. But it’s important also that they don’t alienate the public while they’re doing it. Uh huh. Updated at 1.26am BST 12.27am BST ACTU leaders to push for closure of labour law loopholes Australian Council of Trade Union leaders as well as union members from across Australia are headed to the parliament today to push for the parliament to close loopholes in labour laws which allow businesses to pay labour hire workers less than other workers.

He makes clear this doesn’t change Australia’s activities in the South China Sea: Defence is supporting the government’s efforts to stabilise relations with China. In March defence hosted the People’s Liberation Army in Russell [the Canberra suburb where Defence is based] for the first Defence dialogue since 2019. These talks were an opportunity to exchange views on regional security issues – and for us to underline our national interests directly to the PLA. Meanwhile, ADF vessels and aircraft have continued to exercise Australia’s rights under international law to freedom of navigation and overflight, including in the South China Sea, and in support of UNSC [United Nations Security Council] resolutions on North Korea’s illegal nuclear weapons program. Updated at 12.31am BST 12.21am BST Victorian Greens demand two-year rent freeze in exchange for supporting tax reform bills The Victorian Greens leader, Samantha Ratnam, is demanding a two-year rent freeze in exchange for supporting the government’s new taxes. She told reporters: The Greens are really concerned that there aren’t enough safeguards for renters within its tax reform package. That’s why the Greens want safeguards as part of ensuring confidence to support the government’s tax reform bills and the best way the government can provide a safe guide for renters is implementing a rent freeze now, we’ve had polling just overnight, revealing that the majority of Australians support stronger safeguards for renters, including a rent freeze. It’s very likely the government is going to need the support of the Greens in order to guarantee passage of its tax reform bills. We want the government to sit down with the Greens and implemented stronger safeguards. Ratnam, however, would not say if it would block the legislation if its demands aren’t met. (Which is likely given the treasurer ruled out a rent freeze last week.) Leader of the Victorian Greens, Samantha Ratnam.

He said: But housing construction has not yet worked through its cyclical downturn. There are still a large number of dwellings under construction. Almost 240,000 in the December quarter, which is currently supporting activity. However, approvals for new buildings have fallen significantly over recent months. After the current pipeline of work is completed, the downturn in approvals will mean fewer housing starts. This will naturally flow through to construction work done.

He mentions Russia’s war in Ukraine and alludes to China’s military buildup in his opening summary: War has returned to Europe as Russia persists in its illegal invasion of Ukraine, and we face the largest military build-up ever seen in the Indo-Pacific. The increasing risks of climate change, proliferation and pandemics require greater, not less global cooperation. This tougher strategic environment is driving the sense of urgency with which Defence is now implementing government direction in response to the review. In the month since the government’s announcement, we have taken action against the six priority areas the government has identified. Moriarty says these steps include work to advance the nuclear-powered submarines. As previously announced, 1 July will see the establishment of a submarine agency to oversee nuclear-powered submarine program. He also says Defence is looking at streamlining its acquisition processes: We have begun work to remove unnecessary barriers to acquisitions. Secretary of the Department of Defence, Greg Moriarty.

But Kennedy said this has put “strains on economies around the world”, with “wild swings in demand” for products, and inflation in energy prices due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This was followed by high inflation, sharply rising interest rates and tightening financial conditions, he said. These put a strain on households and caused businesses to delay or scale back investment. Kennedy said: The risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Overall, we are expecting the pace of global growth in 2023 and 2024 to be the weakest in two decades outside the GFC and the Covid-19 pandemic.” Kennedy said the economy likely reached its peak in the September quarter and is now “transitioning to a more balanced position between supply and demand”. Interest rates will likely “remain elevated for a time” and inflation is not likely to return to the RBA’s 2-3% target band quickly. The secretary of Treasury, Steven Kennedy.

Australia’s big banks have loaned more than $13bn for fossil fuel projects over the past two years even as they publicly advocate for emissions reductions, a new report suggests. Analysis by environmental activist group Market Forces has found that while Australia’s major banks largely avoid providing direct project finance to new coal, oil and gas projects, they do fund corporate entities that develop them. Market Forces said the financing arrangements represented a loophole that enabled lenders to bankroll fossil fuel production while claiming not to directly support new projects.

He says he was caught by surprise: Mark McGowan, he’s a very good friend of mine, and I wish him the very best and it’s a rare thing in politics to be able to go on your own terms. And that’s exactly what Mark McGowan has done. And I think he can be very, very proud of the work that he’s done over a very long term. Very, very proud of the work he’s done over a very long period of time, almost 30 years in public life. Western Australian premier Mark McGowan announces his resignation on Monday.

And there’s a lot to get on with … These jobs are an amazing privilege. And there are no easy days in this job. That’s not a complaint. That’s just a fact. And so it makes them so special. Because the work that you do impacts people in every corner of our state and if you’ve got a bit of ambition, then you can influence things well beyond your state. You can actually drive national reform. I think Mark’s done his fair share of that. You’d like to think that Victoria has played a part in that also.

The NSW cabinet last night approved the bills that would see the government deliver on its election promise to pause growth for the state’s most highly paid public sector workers. The premier, Chris Minns, said: We have inherited a challenging budget, but budgets are about priorities. Our priority is rebuilding our essential services and investing in frontline workers. The government is facing increasing pressure from unions to abolish the frontline worker pay freeze, with unions so far declining the state’s offers amid ongoing industrial action.

Asked whether the government is investigating any of its contracts with PwC, he said: The secretary of my department has spoken with very senior people at PwC and sought assurances about their conduct both in the past and indeed any work that they’re doing at the moment. We’ve received those those important assurances. And what’s more, I’ve asked the very direct question of my secretary, ‘Is it safe for us to wait until the federal government does whatever they’re going to do in relation to PwC?’ They’ve got a number of different processes ongoing at the moment. The advice to me is yes, we can wait and see what comes out of the federal government’s work. And then once they make decisions either how far away that will be but if and when they make decisions about the future PwC and its work for the government. Then we’ll obviously look at that very carefully. Victoria premier Daniel Andrews.

Updated at 11.36pm BST 11.15pm BST The highest number of women in recorded history are in full-time work in Australia The employment minister, Tony Burke, and minister for women, Katy Gallagher, have released new statistics about employment, and particularly the participation of women. Some highlights: Between May 2022 and April 2023, total net jobs have increased by 332,900. 85% of total jobs growth over the last 11 months (from May 2022 to April 2023) have been full-time jobs. 163,900 more women have joined the labour force since May 2022. Women’s labour force participation hit a record high in June 2022 and March 2023. The highest number of women in recorded history are in full-time work. Female full-time employment currently stands at 3,826,900. Burke said: We’re not just getting women into jobs – we’re getting them into secure, full-time jobs. This is what happens when you have a government that is determined to improve job security and get wages moving – it encourages more people to join or come back to the workforce. Gallagher said: This is a government that puts women at the heart of our decision-making, which is why in our first year in office we’ve delivered the biggest investment in women in the last 40 years. Supporting women to work in decent jobs is the key to women’s economic equality – and women’s equality isn’t just a nice to have, it’s an economic and social imperative. Updated at 11.29pm BST 11.15pm BST ‘People need to know’: O’Neill calls on PwC to name staff put on leave One of the reasons Deborah O’Neill believes PwC needs to make all the names public is because of the possibility some may have moved on to other firms and organisations and for transparency sake, “people need to know” where they are: They may no longer be at PwC they may have moved on and you know who knows they could have created their own businesses. They could be now on the international board of auditing standards. They could be at Deloitte in London. I trust the people who are interacting with all those who are named the 53 in the emails to find out about whether that person is suitably engaged currently, people need to know these assurance companies are critical to the proper functioning of the market of the financial markets, not just in Australia, but globally. They are in positions to influence what people know and discern about the truth or otherwise of documents that relate to company outcomes.

Updated at 11.53pm BST 11.13pm BST O’Neill decries ‘contemptuous’ response from PwC Labor senator Deborah O’Neill said the response from Price Waterhouse Cooper has done nothing to restore trust. She told the ABC: Would you trust them? Do you think your listeners would trust them? Do you think that I trust them at this point of time? And after what we saw yesterday, how can we possibly trust them? This is this is the equivalent of PwC in Australia just wagging their finger at the nation saying, ‘Don’t you worry about that. We’ve sent nine people home to have an extended holiday that’s going to sort the problem out. Do you want the 53 names? Sorry, we’re not going to give it to you.’ That is the response we’ve had from PwC. It’s contemptuous. O’Neill said it surprised her that PwC put people on leave and have not named them. The reason that I’m continuing to push for PwC to put the names on the record themselves, is they made this mess, they unleashed this kind of behaviour. The PwC company logo on a building in Sydney.

In January it emerged that a former PwC tax advisor was found to have shared confidential government briefings on multinational tax consultations with clients Since then it has emerged more people were involved, and the matter has been referred to the Australian federal police. The firm put partners on leave yesterday, but have not named them. O’Neill says the response has not been good enough.

This is about a cover-up. This is about PwC trying to stem the flow of an artery that’s well and truly open now, the reality is that this is a company that has not been open and honest with the Australian people. The matter was referred to the AFP last week. Treasury will be questioned about the matter in estimates in hearings today. PwC Australia’s acting chief executive, Kristin Stubbins released a statement yesterday: Specifically, I apologise to the community; to the Australian government for breaching your confidentiality; to our clients for any questions this may have raised about our integrity and trustworthiness and to the 10,000 hard-working, values-driven PwC Australia partners and staff who have been unfairly impacted.” Stubbins acknowledged the firm “did not have adequate processes and governance in place”, and had a culture in its tax business that “both allowed inappropriate behaviour and has not, until now, always properly held our leaders and those involved to account”. PwC announced that nine partners will go on leave “effective immediately”. The firm said it was moving to ring-fence its government work “to minimise conflicts of interest and enhance governance”. That will include a standalone executive and governance board to cover all services to federal government departments and agencies.

The Greens take steps to fight racism wherever it occurs. Now, what Senator Thorpe was referring to, is highlighting the practice of institutional racism, something that we’ve seen, for example, Stan Grant draw attention to over the period of time. What what is clear, I think and what we learned from the First Nations MPs in our party including Senator Thorpe, when she was in the party, is that First Nations MPs, MPs of colour, face discrimination and barriers that other MPs don’t and that is something that we all have a job across parties across the parliament to learn how to do better. And since I’ve been leader, we’ve taken steps within our own party to have that kind of, that look at what it means for First Nations MPs and MPs of colour to face institutional racism, how we can ensure that practices change, so that they don’t have MPs of colour and First Nations MPs are encouraged to get in parliament, those practices of institutional racism that exists across society that no one is immune from is something we all have an obligation to take steps to address.

Treasury said that the Woodside project would be excluded from the changes announced in the last budget (deductions will be limited to 90% of revenue, with the PRRT applying on the remaining 10%) because it had pre-exisiting royalty arrangements. Bandt is not having it. The tax is still broken, and they’re meant to be subjected to it. They should pay their fair share of tax. As I say, even after these changes, Australia only brings in a few $100 million extra from these big gas corporations that are making billions of dollars of profits. It’s about a 10th of what comparable countries bring in. If we made these guess corporations pay their fair share of tax. They’d be an extra $94 billion over the decade to go to things like delivering cost-of-living relief, funding a rent freeze, getting dental into Medicare. Greens leader Adam Bandt.

In a stirring delivery of the Lowitja O’Donoghue Oration in Adelaide, Anthony Albanese said he believed Australians would wake up on that morning with “the strongest sense of ourselves”. A great nation that has dared to become even greater, not just to ourselves but to the world,” he said. His speech came ahead of federal parliament’s return, when MPs will continue debate on the proposed wording to alter the constitution. The legislation is expected to be voted on in the lower house this week, before it heads to the Senate. Once it passes both houses of parliament, the wheels will be set in motion for a referendum to be held between October and November this year. Albanese said after a successful referendum, treaty and truth-telling would be part of the nation’s next phase of reconciliation with Indigenous people. One of the things that a voice to parliament will be able to do is talk about the need for agreement making and coming together after a conflict, and part of that is truth- telling about our history,” he said. The prime minister used his speech to call out the “fog of fiction and misunderstanding” that had been peddled about the voice in the past few months.

Pointing to the latest quarterly Labour Market Update released by Jobs and Skills Australia, O’Connor said skills shortages are particularly persistent in regional areas. Shortages of doctors, nurses medical staff and other essential services workers in regional and rural areas is a particular concern. Regional areas are facing skills shortages in a number of occupations including: general practitioners and resident medical officers, registered nurses, medical imaging professionals, early childhood (pre-primary school) teachers, cooks, motor mechanics, automotive electricians, and mining engineers. O’Connor said the government’s fee-free Tafe programs had been particularly popular in regional areas, as well as noting the number of long-term unemployed had dropped in the last quarter. The skills shortage crisis we inherited persists and the Australian government is committed to addressing this – our reform policies are more crucial than ever. Fee-free Tafe and VET across the country has seen a strong take-up in regional areas, which will help develop the pipeline of workers needed.

Let’s get into it. 9.59pm BST Government won't appoint voice members, says Burney Indigenous Australians minister Linda Burney says the government won’t appoint members to the voice – and that the body would help negotiate treaties with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. At a referendum forum in Canberra, Burney said there would be “no government appointments, none” to the voice. Some critics have recently questioned whether the voice would feature members appointed by the government – despite design principles of the voice, released publicly by the referendum working group, saying members “will be chosen by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people based on the wishes of local communities”. At the forum, Burney said she had given some thought to exactly how that will work, but again reinforced prior statements that the exact details of the voice would be worked out post-referendum, following consultation with Indigenous Australians. Burney said this process would go around the country. Asked about treaties, Burney said the Uluru statement from the heart called for a “sequential” order of voice, truth and treaty. Burney said a Makarrata commission (which the government is in process of setting up) would oversee a national process of agreement-making and treaty – but reinforced the government’s belief that voice must come first. “You’ve got to have someone to negotiate with. Obviously the voice would have a role in that,” Burney said. She noted that treaties would take 10 to 15 years to negotiate, saying the most contemporary example (in British Columbia) was at that upper edge. “Quite frankly I don’t want to be sitting around in 15 years time, I might not even be around in 15 years, not having a voice to parliament,” Burney said. She again stressed that the government had committed to the Uluru statement in full – which included treaty. Minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney. Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP Updated at 10.45pm BST 9.47pm BST Defence funding has fallen despite demands, says Aspi The Australian Strategic Policy Institute, which is part-funded by the Department of Defence, has crunched the defence budget figures. In a report out today, titled “The big squeeze”, Aspi says the urgency of the demands upon defence is not reflected in its funding, at least in the short term: The only increase in the defence budget over the next three years is compensation for the increased cost of imported military equipment flowing from a fall in the value of the Australian dollar. Excluding this, the core funding of Defence (not including the Australian Signals Directorate) has actually been reduced at a time when unprecedented demands are being placed upon it. Between 2023-4 and 2025-6, defence funding, excluding compensation for adverse foreign exchange movements, drops from $154bn to $152.5bn. That is based on a comparison of the total funding over those three years and what had been earmarked in the Coalition’s March 2022 budget. The Aspi report also warns that the department’s ability to recruit and retain personnel is “the primary risk” to achieving the plan outlined in the defence strategic review: With unemployment at near record lows, Defence has been unable to meet its recruitment targets, which has been further exacerbated by increasing separation rates among uniformed personnel. Defence had planned for the ADF to raise its numbers this year (2022-23) by 2,201 but instead faced a contraction in size by 1,389 uniformed personnel. 9.35pm BST Welcome Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll be bringing you a few of our top overnight yarns before my colleague Amy Remeikis takes over. The top story today is our latest Essential poll which shows that a majority of voters support interventionist measures such as a rent freeze and migration caps to help ease pressures on the housing market. Such policies are supported by the Greens and the Coalition so the poll spells trouble for the Albanese government if they ignore popular opinion for much longer.

Here is a wrap of the day’s biggest stories: Liberal MP Julian Leeser has resigned as shadow attorney general and shadow minister for Indigenous Australians so he can campaign for a yes vote in the voice referendum. Opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said that while Leeser “doesn’t leave with rancour [and] does not leave with bitterness”, his stance is “at odds with the overwhelming majority of the Liberal party members in our party room”. Dutton said he will spend the next week considering who should replace Leeser in the shadow cabinet. Meanwhile, One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, called for senator Simon Birmingham to follow in the steps of his Liberal colleague Leeser and resign over his stance on the voice. The Australian government has announced “a pathway” to resolve the barley dispute with China after hefty tariffs were introduced by Beijing at the height of diplomatic tensions in 2020.

A storm developing off the Western Australian coast is expected to turn into a cyclone before making landfall, bringing powerful winds and potential flooding. Nearly 50 Australian federal politicians have today put their name to a letter to the US attorney general urging him to drop the bid to extradite Julian Assange from the UK. Updated at 9.41am BST 9.14am BST Some more commentary on Tropical Cyclone Ilsa, courtesy of Weatherzone: The last cyclone originating in Australian waters to make landfall on the mainland was Cyclone Ellie on December 22, 2022. While that storm’s winds didn’t cause widespread damage, the system was notable because of its persistence as a tropical low, which delivered flooding rains far inland for weeks. There are early indications that Ilsa could also bring heavy rains far inland, albeit to different parts of the interior. But before that happens, its immediate impacts on coastal communities and nearby areas could be far more severe. No, this is not the world's largest jellyfish. It's an infrared sat pic of rapidly intensifying Tropical Cyclone Ilsa, which will cross the WA coastline as a very dangerous Category 4 storm in a couple of days.

Forecasting ahead of the colder months is tricky but health officials are monitoring trends and considering a potential early start to the flu season, NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant, said on Tuesday. Health insurer Bupa went a step further, warning of a “triple pandemic”. It said northern hemisphere modelling indicated winter illnesses will arrive earlier than expected in Australia and be worse than last year, likely hospitalising more people. Dr Chant told reporters: We are considering the potential early start to the flu season and a protracted flu season. Covid transmissions and hospitalisations have also increased, particularly in recent weeks - a trend that elderly people and other vulnerable groups need to particularly take note of. About 1000 people in NSW are currently hospitalised with Covid, 20 of them in intensive care. Royal Australian College of General Practitioners president, Nicole Higgins, said people have been travelling more and have stopped measures such as wearing masks and washing hands, which has allowed flu to spread. - from AAP Updated at 8.54am BST 8.29am BST My colleague Daniel Hurst has published a fantastic explainer on the government’s deal with China that may lead to the removal of tariffs on Australian barley that were introduced at the height of diplomatic tensions in 2020. Hurst writes: The move, announced on Tuesday, offers China an off-ramp to quietly dismount from its 80% tariffs on Australian barley that were due to be scrutinised by a public ruling by a World Trade Organization dispute panel within weeks.

As a tropical low off the Kimberley Coast intensifies to cyclone thresholds later today, we anticipate significant impacts to the West Australia coast. Taking a look at the current satellite imagery, we see this system setting off the Kimberley coast, a massive cloud dragging in rotation and moisture to this area. A tropical cyclone track map has the tropical low currently sitting to the north of Broome, and over the coming hours, we are expecting this system to move south-west and intensify to tropical cyclone thresholds. Going through Wednesday and Thursday, the system is expected to continue moving southwest adjacent to the Kimberley coast before hooking to the south and then southeast and crossing the coast as a category four cyclone sometime on Thursday between Broome and Port Hedland.

It’s workforce, workforce, workforce ... it’s not just nuclear physicists we need, although we do need some of those and it’s a very specialist profession. Almost every area of human endeavour we need a capacity uplift in, so engineers, doctors, nurses, psychologists, pretty much everyone. It’s really important that we get this absolutely right, and get it right for the country, but do it in collaboration with our colleagues from the US and the UK. Jackson said Australian universities had 10,000 research collaboration links worldwide and more would be needed to fill the gaps – particularly with the UK and the US. There are simply not enough skilled, highly educated workers just to deal with the Aukus workforce, the 20,000 people we’ll need in Australia. It’s fundamental that we collaborate with our colleagues, we learn from each other, we educate each other, rather than just stealing each other’s skilled workers. It’s not just Aukus. Almost every serious challenge we face, from energy transition to water quality to almost everything, is something we can do better, bigger and with more capacity and more speed if we take full advantage of our universities here and with our collaborators overseas.” Universities Australia CEO, Catriona Jackson, has said ‘we need a capacity uplift’ in almost every area of human endeavour' … ‘in collaboration with our colleagues from the US and the UK’.

Having a different position doesn’t mean [you’re racist], and it doesn’t mean that you are not doing the decent thing. I am just encouraging the Prime Minister to reset the tone of the debate. He has the biggest megaphone in Australian politics and the tone has been very negative. Assistant Minister for health and aged care, Ged Kearney, instead argued the PM has been “nothing but positive” during the whole debate. He has framed it purely as an offer, a very generous offer, from First Nations people … I don’t think there has been any disrespect or negativity. The only negativity I am really seeing is coming from the opposition, accusing us of all sorts of different things, when really we’re just out there asking people to consider this generous offer from First Nations Australians to have a voice to parliament.

According to a statement, it is alleged that the man is a registered pharmacist operating a business in Essendon without Victorian Pharmacy approval. Detectives conducted a search warrant at the business last November where the man, aged 40, was arrested. Another search warrant was executed on the business on April 5 when police seized significant quantities of prescription medication, including anabolic steroids. The Victorian Police statement reads: The Essendon man was charged with multiple counts of forgery, obtain drugs by false representation, possess prescription medication, unauthorised retailing of poisons or controlled substances, unauthorised possession of a poison or controlled substance, trafficking drug of dependence, trafficking anabolic steroids and trafficking testosterone.

Updated at 7.39am BST 7.26am BST Jenny McAllister says that when it comes to the voice, Dutton ‘is really just looking for excuses to say no’ On Afternoon Briefing, energy minister, Jenny McAllister, is asked about a claim made by Opposition leader, Peter Dutton, that the voice will cost billions of dollars and require thousands of public servants. She said: If Mr Dutton wants to make assertions of that kind, he really needs to substantiate them. We are really clear that this is a modest proposal - the parliament will have primacy, that is clear [in] the wording to be put to the people. The details [will] be sorted through in the ordinary way through a parliamentary process after the referendum. Mr Dutton is really just looking for excuses to say no. Updated at 7.30am BST 7.21am BST MPs react to Julian Leeser’s resignation from shadow cabinet Reactions to Julian Leeser’s resignation from the shadow cabinet have been flowing throughout the afternoon on social media. Labor senator, Malarndirri McCarthy, said she worked with him many years ago on the 2018 Parliamentary Committee into Constitutional Recognition for Indigenous Australians and “always thought of him as a man of principle”. Mr Leeser’s resignation from the Coalition frontbench must not have been an easy decision but I thank him for the position he has taken in putting principle above politics and wanting to see a better way forward for Australia. \uD83E\uDDF5(3/3) — Malarndirri McCarthy (@Malarndirri19) April 11, 2023 Independent senator, David Pocock, said Leeser demonstrated “moral courage”.

Julian Leeser stepping down from shadow cabinet instead of campaigning against Indigenous recognition is an act of integrity and decency. It’s not too late for Peter Dutton to hear his message and rethink his position. — Tanya Plibersek (@tanya_plibersek) April 11, 2023 Updated at 7.26am BST 7.12am BST Karen Andrews sorry to see Julian Leeser step down but remains ‘very clear’ on Opposition’s stance on voice Shadow home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, is speaking on the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing and is asked about her Liberal colleague Julian Leeser’s resignation from the front bench due to his stance on the voice. She said: Julian has had years of working on this particular issue [and] he had some very strong views on it. I am sorry that he has taken the decision to resign from our frontbench, but I understand the position that he felt he needed to continue to prosecute. When asked if she thinks any reservations on the wording of the voice proposal could be addressed through the committee process underway in parliament – as Leeser seems to believe - she said there is “potentially a very outside chance”: Will anything come out of the committee process? I guess we will need to wait and see. But at this stage I’ve very clear [and] the position of the opposition is very, very clear, that we do not support the wording that is proposed by Mr Albanese.

The seat was formerly held by retiring Liberal MP Victor Dominello. Related: NSW Liberals win final lower-house seat of Ryde two weeks after state election Updated at 7.11am BST 6.44am BST Angus Campbell said the world is under “considerable stress”, pointing to the Russia-Ukraine conflict as the main source of this. Nowhere is the stress in the international system and the international rules-based order more apparent [than] in the current, desperate fight for survival by Ukraine against Russian aggression. He said as the boundaries between “competition, coercion and conflict become increasingly blurred” there is a need for greater integration of, and nuance in, the application of power. The ADF’s response to this? “Integrated campaigning”. … it involves military power being brought together with other elements of national power, be they economic, diplomatic, trade, financial, industrial, scientific or informational, and when directed by government, also combined with the military and national power of allies and partners. Campbell noted that the Russia-Ukraine conflict matters on a local level and is felt across Europe, but also “matters to all small and middle-sized nations, each of whom needs international rules and norms more than the limited power that they wield”. And the war also matters because its impact on key supply chains, especially food and energy, reminds us that in a globalised world, few conflicts are truly local. But most fundamentally, it matters because respect for sovereign territorial integrity is the cornerstone of our international system. Campbell also included two quotes from Russian sources – Trotsky and Stalin. I’ll finish by quoting two Russian sources that speak to the tragedy and the challenge faced by Ukraine and its supporters. The tragedy - Trotsky reminds us that ‘you may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you’. A sadly timeless reality that encourages preparedness. And the challenge – Stalin reminds us that ‘quantity has a quality all its own’ … Campbell again pointed to the Aukus partnership as one of Australia’s responses to this “deteriorating strategic environment”. Updated at 6.54am BST 6.28am BST Angus Campbell tells Lowy Institute Australia’s ‘strategic environment’ has ‘deteriorated’ Chief of Defence Force General, Angus Campbell, has spoken at the Lowy Institute today on all things international security. He said Australia’s “strategic environment” has “deteriorated” – and that this is a bipartisan view. Trends including large-scale military modernisation, technological disruption, and multiplying climate risks continue, and the prospect of state-on-state conflict is less remote than it was. Military capability within the region, of both range and legality, is challenging across all domains – sea, land, air, space and cyber. Additionally, the use of coercive statecraft, law-fare and influence operations in the grey zone between peace and war undermine the traditional understandings of the international rules based order and tests the threshold of conventional military response. We live in an era and a region of great power competition, and an era I think that may last for some time. Campbell said that in response, the ADF has increased their presence in the Indo-Pacific region to deter conflict and maintain a capacity to operationally respond as directed by government. The most prominent and recent illustration of this engagement is of course, the Aukus programme.

NSW Farmers president, Xavier Martin, said he observed mice “swarming all over the road” near Coonabarabran in the Warrumbungle Shire. Martin told AAP: The worst of it was probably at least half a kilometre long. I came into some big patches where there were hundreds of mice running backwards and forwards in different directions looking for food. Members are telling me they’re seeing mice again all the way from Queensland down to the Victorian border and out west towards Adelaide. Martin has received reports of damage to crops and fodder across the state, and urged farmers to remain vigilant. He said: We’ve got mice at the moment damaging our sorghum crop, and no doubt damaging other farmers’ summer crops and fodder. They’re getting into hay sheds and we’ve just got to hope we can get on top of them, and not let them develop like they did two years ago. He urged farmers to use chew cards to record mice numbers.

Our resident political expert, Amy Remeikis, is here to remind us that the voice has no veto power and is definitely not essentially another arm of government. The Indigenous voice to parliament will not be lobbying the RBA or have access to cabinet papers, or be making defence decisions and is not another arm of government.

In a statement the GrainGrowers chair, Rhys Turton, says a resolution is in the best interests of both countries and acknowledges that China’s market for Australian grain accounts for 60-70% of Australia’s barley exports. This is a step in the right direction for trade between our two countries and highlights the value of the WTO process to encourage mechanisms for bilateral dispute resolution. It is heartening to see a resolution of constructive dialogue between the two governments, and we are hopeful that this process will result in a positive outcome for Australian growers. We thank Minister Wong and Minster Farrell for their efforts in securing the review and, as growers, are hoping that our strong relationship with China can be resumed quickly.

Dutton said he will consider this over the next week. Leeser’s stepping off the frontbench was no surprise to Dutton. The opposition leader was also adamant that Leeser’s position as a Liberal in support of the Voice to parliament was a unique one. (But as Josh Butler broke down for us just before Dutton’s presser, there is a growing lineup of MPs across parties – including Liberal MPs like Bridget Archer and Andrew Bragg – who are backing Leeser’s move in support of the voice to parliament.) Updated at 5.33am BST 4.29am BST Dutton says Australians must look past ‘feelgood’ vibe on voice referendum Opposition leader Peter Dutton urges Australians to look past a “feelgood vibe” when considering their vote on the Voice referendum. At a superficial level people understand that we need a better outcome for Indigenous Australians, we all have that in our hearts. But we believe we have a better pathway to get there, if it does not disrupt the future of our country and that is why we are campaigning no. I know that people are motivated by a feelgood … vibe. I understand that, but you need to dig a bit deeper and look at what it is that is being proposed here. It is allowing a national voice that is appointed, not elected, to essentially be another arm of the government to scrutinise, to lobby, to influence every decision of government. Think about that for a second, [is] that in our country’s best interest? Updated at 4.39am BST 4.12am BST Peter Dutton thanks attorney general for service to shadow frontbench Opposition leader Peter Dutton affirms he is not concerned over Leeser’s stepping down from the frontbench in support of the voice to parliament. Julian has a history … about the design of a voice. As he pointed out today, he has set up an organisation which was designed to bring people together around conditional change. He comes from a unique perspective. I have worked very closely with him … He is a dear friend and I only thank him for his service on the frontbench to our party. I’m very pleased that he is going to continue to fight for our cause, because he has a lifelong belief in the values of the Liberal party. Updated at 6.16am BST 4.08am BST Peter Dutton speaks on Julian Leeser’s resignation from cabinet Leader of the opposition Peter Dutton addresses Julian Lesser’s decision to step down from the shadow cabinet to campaign Yes for the Voice to parliament, at a presser in Brisbane: [Leeser] is a person that has our country’s best interest at heart and as he pointed out, he doesn’t leave with the rancour or does not leave with bitterness. He has gone through a process in our party and his position is at odds with the overwhelming majority of the Liberal party members in our party room. Our determination is to make sure that we have local and regional voices as we want to listen to those people in the communities together best possible outcome for them. The prime minister[’s] … proposal, a Canberra voice, will not deliver that outcome. Updated at 4.15am BST 4.02am BST Nationals senator Jacinta Price says she respects Julian Leeser’s decision The Nationals senator and no campaign leader Jacinta Price said she respects Julian Leeser’s decision to stand down from the shadow cabinet in order to campaign yes for the Indigenous voice. Price, the first-term senator from the Northern Territory, was instrumental in the Nationals resolving to oppose the referendum last year - which set the ball rolling for the Liberals to follow suit last week. She will also lead a well-funded no campaign from the Advance conservative lobby group. Her office issued a short statement to Guardian Australia on Leeser’s departure, saying she was “proud to be part of a coalition with the Liberal party that allows members to stand for their personal beliefs and champion issues important to them, and I respect the decision made by Mr Julian Leeser MP today to do just that.” “Our democracy is stronger when members of parliament have the freedom to follow their conscience and are not bound to party positions,” Price said. I congratulate Julian on his hard work as shadow attorney general and shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, and I look forward to continuing to work with him in the future on matters that are important to us both. As Rafqa brought you a moment ago, the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, has publicly called for Price to be named Leeser’s replacement as shadow Indigenous minister. It’s not clear who will fill that role (we asked Price’s office if she would put her hand up for it) but the picture may get clearer when Peter Dutton holds a press conference in Brisbane after 1pm today. Updated at 4.06am BST 4.01am BST What’s up with barley and China? Here is some context on why barley matters when it comes to Australia and China’s relationship (courtesy of reporting by our foreign affairs and defence correspondent, Daniel Hurst). The Chinese government rolled out hefty tariffs on a range of Australian exports at the height of diplomatic tensions in 2020 – including wine, barley, coal, timber and lobster. China is the largest export market for Australian barley, because it is used to make beer and feed livestock. The tariffs intended to bring significant pain to the industry. You can read more about China’s tarriffs on Australia here: Related: Why has China slapped tariffs on Australian barley and what can Australia do about it? While some progress has been made in recent months, like the resumption of the coal trade, the wine and barley tariff disputes are considered more complex, with World Trade Organization rulings due in coming months.

(Our foreign affairs and defence correspondent Daniel Hurst has given us a breakdown of the pathway earlier in the blog). “Obviously, stabilisation and the resolution of trade issues will take time. But we’re pleased that constructive dialogue has resumed,” Wong said. “We’ve had a number of discussions at foreign minister level, at trade minister, at assistant minister level, and also at leader level. We have made clear that we believe there’s no justification for the measures that China introduced in relation to barley. We have also made clear that we believe it is in both countries’ interests for these trade impediments to be removed. So today I can confirm that China has agreed to undertake an expedited review of the duties imposed on Australian barley over a three-month period, that may extend to a fourth, if required. In return, we have agreed to temporarily suspend the World Trade Organization dispute for the agreed review period. If it is successful, Wong says we can expect a similar process to be followed in relation to the trade barriers that exist on Australian wine. Updated at 3.33am BST 3.14am BST Australia announces ‘pathway’ to resolve China barley dispute The Australian government has announced “a pathway” to resolve the barley dispute with China after hefty tariffs were introduced by Beijing at the height of diplomatic tensions in 2020. The foreign affairs minister Penny Wong and the trade minister Don Farrell made the announcement in Adelaide a short time ago. Wong said China had “agreed to undertake an expedited review” of its tariffs on Australian barley over a three-month period. In return, she said, Australia had agreed to temporarily suspend the World Trade Organization dispute process. She said if the tariffs were not removed at the end of that process, Australia would resume the WTO dispute. It comes amid ongoing efforts to “stabilise” the relationship between Australia and China. The Chinese government rolled out hefty tariffs, unofficial bans or other restrictions against a range of Australian export sectors in 2020, including wine, barley, coal, timber and lobster. While some progress has been made in recent months, such as the resumption of the coal trade, the wine and barley tariff disputes were considered more complex, given the involvement of the WTO. The barley ruling was due imminently and wine later in the year.

It’s about recognition and consultation, recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in our Australian constitution, and consulting them about matters that affect their lives. That’s what it’s about. And Julian Leeser has shown real strength today. He put his principles first. He put his principles ahead of partisan politics and we welcome that. It can’t have been easy for him to do. Can’t have been easy for him to relinquish portfolios that he cares so deeply about and he knows as much about this issue as anyone and he understands this is a once in a generation chance to make a real difference in the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and to help close the gap.

He has invested a huge amount of his political capital in an issue which has been highly contested within the Liberal party.

Almost on cue, a Perth-based hydrogen and graphic production tech firm, Hazer, has announced it is proceeding with a so-called project development plan with a couple of other Japanese giants, Chubu Electric and Chiyoda Corporation, to work on a plant in Japan. The firms aim to build a clean hydrogen and graphitic carbon production hub, with Chubu using the produced hydrogen “as a fuel for power generation and other hard to abate industries, as well as mobility, in the Nagoya area”, Hazer said in a statement. “Chubu Electric Power Group is firmly committed to decarbonisation of its operations and that of our customers,” said Kouji Sada, the general manager of the electric power research and development centre at Chubu Electric. “We believe the Hazer technology offers an attractive solution to locally produce low-carbon hydrogen, using our existing supply chains and infrastructure.” Glenn Corrie, Hazer’s CEO, said: “Hazer has always viewed Japan as an important and strategic market for the deployment of our unique technology.” Perhaps not surprisingly, Hazer’s shares have perked up today, rising by as much as 13% in early trade.

I’m proud to be the Liberal member for Berowra. I’m not going anywhere in terms of my support for the Liberal party. Everybody has to make their own decision about these matters and that’s what I’m doing today. My final goal for this term is to work for the election of a Coalition government under the leadership of Peter Dutton. In Peter Dutton we have the most experienced and tested opposition leader in our history. Updated at 2.37am BST 2.18am BST Leeser to push for amendments to Labor’s voice model Julian Leeser says he will support the voice in the constitution, even if his proposed amendments are not made by the government: I’m looking closely at proposed amendments to the government’s model. That’s why I put forward the Press Club model that provides a pathway for the funding of local and regional bodies, a model that seeks to amend the government’s proposal in order to give the referendum the best chance of success. I will fight for those amendments, but ultimately I will support the referendum. I’m a supporter of the voice. I think it’s right that it has a place in the constitution. I think, though, making those amendments puts the referendum on a better chance of success and has a better chance of convincing more Australians to support this.

When it comes to the voice, I believe that Australians who remain to be convinced by the “yes” case fall into three groups. The first group are those opposed to the voice on philosophical or constitutional grounds. The second group are those who support the voice in principle, or who want to support it, but who in the vast majority of cases have genuine doubts and questions about the proposal that the government’s put forward. And the third group are yet to engage, but they, too, will have questions and concerns. I understand those concerns. I, too, have wrestled with them. I believe that during the committee and parliamentary debates in the months ahead, we can answer those concerns and put the referendum on a surer footing for success. Updated at 2.14am BST 2.07am BST Leeser: ‘The time for the voice has come’ Former shadow minister for Indigenous Australians Julian Leeser is addressing a presser in Sydney on his resignation from shadow cabinet following the Liberal party’s opposition to the voice to parliament: I believe the time for the voice has come. I believe in local and regional voices. I believe in a national voice, drawn from local and regional bodies, and support the referendum being put this year. I believe that voice can help move the dial on Indigenous education, health, housing, safety and economic development.

Considering the Liberals’ decision to strongly oppose the referendum and Peter Dutton’s decision to actively campaign against, you could consider that Dutton appoints another strong critic of the voice to those roles – or another school of thought could be that he appoints another moderate voice, to make a more nuanced case for the Liberals’ alternate referendum proposal. Michaelia Cash was attorney general when the Coalition was last in government. We imagine there will be some news from Dutton’s camp before too long. Updated at 2.15am BST 2.01am BST Decision on whether Lehrmann’s defamation case can proceed to be made on 28 April Bruce Lehrmann will learn on 28 April whether his defamation case against News Corp and Network Ten can proceed. Lehrmann is seeking to extend the usual 12-month time limit that applies to defamation proceedings so that he can sue News Corp and Network Ten for their initial reporting of Brittany Higgins’ allegations of rape, allegations he has always denied. The federal court this morning ordered that the matter be listed on 28 April so that it can hand down its ruling on Lehrmann’s extension of time application. At a hearing last month, Lehrmann argued that he was delayed in bringing proceedings due to prior legal advice, the prospect of a criminal trial and his mental health. But lawyers for News Corp, Network Ten, Samantha Maiden and Lisa Wilkinson argued it was not reasonable for Lehrmann to have delayed the proceedings, saying he did nothing despite being “acutely aware” that he was in a position to sue for defamation. Justice Michael Lee will hand down his decision at midday on 28 April. Lehrmann pleaded not guilty to one charge of sexual intercourse without consent. His first trial in the ACT supreme court was aborted due to juror misconduct and prosecutors did not proceed with a retrial due to fears for Higgins’ mental health. Updated at 2.12am BST 1.50am BST Latitude refuses to pay ransom following major cyber-attack Consumer lender Latitude Financial has vowed not to pay a ransom to those behind a massive cyber-attack that resulted in the largest-known data breach of a financial institution in Australia. Latitude, which offers personal loans and credit to customers at stores including JB Hi-Fi, The Good Guys and Harvey Norman, said in a statement on Tuesday that its position was in line with Australian government policies. “We will not reward criminal behaviour, nor do we believe that paying a ransom will result in the return or destruction of the information that was stolen,” Latitude said. The Latitude chief executive Bob Belan said a ransom payment would only encourage further extortion attempts on businesses. The lender said the stolen data the attackers detailed as part of a ransom was consistent with the updated number of affected customers disclosed by Latitude late last month. About 14m customer records, including driver’s licence numbers, passport numbers and financial statements, were stolen from its system in a cyber-attack that was far worse than the company initially reported. The details stolen include 7.9m Australian and New Zealand driver’s licence numbers and 53,000 passport numbers. A further 6.1m customer records were stolen, of which 5.7m were provided before 2013. The breach is the latest in a series of major attacks on Australian companies, following hacks at Optus and Medibank, among others. Latitude said regular business operations were being restored after it had taken its platforms offline in response to the attack. Updated at 2.01am BST 1.40am BST Leeser: ‘I intend to campaign for a yes vote’ The shadow attorney general and shadow minister of indigenous affairs Julian Leeser has resigned from the Coalition frontbench over the Liberal party’s opposition to the Indigenous voice to parliament. In a statement on Facebook, he said, “because I intend to campaign for a yes vote I have resigned from the shadow ministry”: Earlier today I resigned from the shadow cabinet. I want to explain to you why. Almost 10 years ago, I sat down with a small group of constitutional conservatives and Indigenous leaders and worked on a proposal for constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. The idea we developed was different, it was organic, it was consistent with our constitutional heritage, and it was a uniquely Australian idea designed for Australian conditions. The proposal was called the voice. It was about creating a new structure to improve outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians – and it was about finding common ground. Over the past year I have had many respectful discussions with my parliamentary colleagues about the voice. I have listened to their views and they have heard mine, but ultimately I have not been able to persuade them. Our tradition in the Liberal party is grounded in a belief in conscience and freedom. While shadow ministers are bound by the decisions of the shadow cabinet and the party room, backbenchers are free to vote on every piece of legislation according to their own conscience. Unlike almost any other party in the parliament, the Liberal party gives backbenchers the freedom to champion the ideas they believe in. Because I intend to campaign for a yes vote I have resigned from the shadow ministry. I want to assure you that I remain a proud Liberal committed to my party, the people of Berowra and the leadership of Peter Dutton. My resignation as a frontbencher is not about personality, it’s about keeping faith with an issue that I have been working on for almost a decade. Updated at 1.46am BST 1.32am BST Contraceptive class action to begin in Melbourne A class action against a contraceptive device that allegedly left women in severe pain will begin in Victoria’s supreme court, Australian Associated Press reports: Law firm Slater and Gordon claims the Essure device sold by Bayer also damaged their client’s health. It alleges the company failed to warn women of the risks associated with the product. Essure is a spring-loaded metal spiral device which, following insertion into a woman’s fallopian tubes, was designed to cut into the soft tissue of the inner walls. This was intended to trigger an inflammatory response to promote the formation of scar tissue around the device, anchoring it in place and blocking the passage of sperm and egg to prevent pregnancy. Lisa Garner, from Tasmania, says she experienced symptoms including haemorrhage-like menstrual bleeding, severe pelvic and abdominal pain and depression after the device was implanted inside her. She had to undergo a hysterectomy at age 35 to have the device removed, putting her into early menopause. The class action trial, expected to run 12 weeks, will begin on Tuesday against Bayer and its associated entities who manufactured and distributed the Essure device in Australia between 1997 and 2017. Slater and Gordon say they represent 1,000 women who are part of the class action. Slater and Gordon class actions senior associate Kylie Trounson said: Australian group members are frustrated that litigation in the US settled for very large sums of money, for the same device, while no settlement has occurred in the Australian proceeding. The Washington Post reported in 2017 that Bayer had sold at least 750,000 Essure devices globally before taking them off the market that year, citing a commercial decision. In August 2020, the company agreed to pay US$1.6bn ($2.5bn) to settle cases with up to 39,000 American women but without admitting wrongdoing or liability. A Bayer spokeswoman reportedly told the Sydney Morning Herald last November the company stood behind the product’s safety and efficacy. “Reduced patient interest in permanent birth control options resulted in a commercial decision to discontinue the distribution of Essure,” she said. Updated at 1.39am BST 1.24am BST Shadow minister for Indigenous Australians Julian Leeser to quit Liberal frontbench Julian Leeser is due to give a press conference at 11am in Sydney. An alert went out this morning identifying Leeser as an MP, and not as the shadow minister for Indigenous Australians and shadow attorney general. When we asked his office about this omission, they referred us to a statement he is expected to make at 10.30am on his Facebook. Sky News is reporting that Leeser will resign as shadow minister. It’s fair to say his resignation is expected, but we have not confirmed it. Leeser wasn’t at the Wednesday press conference when opposition leader Peter Dutton and deputy Sussan Ley announced the Liberals’ position against putting the Indigenous voice in the constitution, which put him in a tricky position as a former theoretical supporter of a voice. Dutton explained his absence by noting he had returned home to Sydney for Passover. On Friday Guardian Australia reported that Leeser had proposed to shadow cabinet to preserve the option of a free vote at least until after the parliamentary inquiry, but this was rejected in favour of opposing the voice in the constitution.

In Queensland, the maximum income for two single adults and a child sits at $877 a week, but Palaszczuk said she wasn’t “aware that it’s different to the other states”. Guardian Australia’s inequality reporter, Stephanie Convery, found Queensland’s maximum income threshold for social housing was staggeringly low while researching a story we worked on last week. She found in Victoria, the closest equivalent classification is for two adults an a dependent child, for which the maximum weekly income threshold is $2,284 a week – more than $1,400 higher than in Queensland. The result of this has been families like the Orlandos being ineligible for Queensland’s social housing list despite having no assets and their only income being Centrelink payments.

We need to strike the right balance between providing that cost-of-living relief and also making sure that we can fund the services we need. Chalmers points to an aged care wage increase, an improvement in Medicare and funding needed for national security. We will do in May what we did in October. We’ll find the right way to trim spending in some areas … Budget responsibility is key and within those constraints doing what we can to help people through a difficult period. We can expect next month’s budget to target cost-of-living relief that won’t keep increasing inflation, relief with electricity bills, and attempts at resilience amid international economic uncertainty.

Chalmers is visiting Washington DC tomorrow to join discussions about the G20, International Monetary Fund and the world bank. “The conditions in the global economy are deteriorating,” he says. He calls the trip an “absolutely crucial opportunity to confer with my colleagues and counterparts about the state of the world economy,” as he puts “financial touches” on the Australian budget. Global conditions have become more complex and more confronting, even in the course of the last few months. Higher interest rates have exposed vulnerabilities in parts of the international banking system and that has added to the already significant challenges of persistent inflation, slowing global growth and the impacts of the war in Ukraine as well. And the recent tremors we’ve seen on global markets have increased uncertainty … The International Monetary Fund is now forecasting the weakest 5-year period for global growth in more than three decades. The focus in the budget will be targeted cost-of-living relief, which doesn’t add to inflation, laying foundations for future growth in our economy and making our economy as resilient as it can be to these international developments.

I mean, if the government is so sure that their model is going to work, then they can legislate it right now if they wanted to.

The 48 MPs and senators – who include government backbenchers and Coalition, Greens and crossbench politicians – urge Merrick Garland to end the extradition proceedings against the Australian citizen and WikiLeaks co-founder: If the extradition request is approved, Australians will witness the deportation of one of our citizens from one Aukus partner to another – our closest strategic ally – with Mr Assange facing the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison. This would set a dangerous precedent for all global citizens, journalists, publishers, media organizations and the freedom of the press. It would also be needlessly damaging for the US as a world leader on freedom of expression and the rule of law. The letter says Assange “has been effectively incarcerated for well over a decade in one form or another, yet the person who leaked classified information had their sentence commuted and has been able to participate in American society since 2017”. The letter adds: A clear majority of Australians consider that this matter has gone on for far too long and must be brought to a close. We implore you to drop the extradition proceedings and allow Mr Assange to return home. The independent MP Andrew Wilkie, the co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Julian Assange Group, initiated the letter. He said the 48 Australian federal parliamentarians who put their name to the formal letter of concern were acting “in concert with similar letters from parliamentarians from around the world” and together represented millions of constituents: This is no small matter and must not be dismissed. Nor should it be ignored that the outpouring of political concern spans the political spectrum and is based on a diverse range of reasons. This reflects how the injustice being endured by Julian Assange is so wrong on so many levels. It must be brought to an end.

Updated at 10.45pm BST 9.58pm BST Inequality is growing – and stage three tax cuts will make it worse: thinktank A new paper from the Australia Institute shows 93% of the benefits of economic growth between 2009 and 2019 went to the top 10%, while the bottom 90% received just 7%. Senior economist with the think tank, Matt Grudnoff, said most Australians would feel “they are not getting ahead” since the global financial crisis in 2007-09. “I think it is really a story about wages and profits,” he said. “Most of us – 90% – receive income from wages, which have gone backwards in real terms. But profits are doing very well and the ownership concentration on those profits is that 10% who are benefitting.” The Australia Institute believes the stage-three tax cuts, legislated to begin from July next year, will make inequality even worse in Australia. People earning more than $180,000 will see the greatest benefit, while low income earners will receive no benefit. The low- and middle-income tax offset which benefited most Australian workers ended in the last financial year – the Morrison government designed it to be temporary – whereas the third stage of the tax reform continues in perpetuity. Grudnoff said inequality in Australia has been increasing, even before those stage-three tax cuts. His latest paper examined income per adult on a pre-tax basis, which means it shows how incomes are apportioned before the tax-and-transfer system kicks in to redistribute some income to lower income households via welfare and public services. It analyses data from five business cycles over the past 70 years. The first cycle, from 1950 to 1960, shows the bottom 90% of income recipients received the vast bulk of the benefits of economic growth. But by the final cycle, from 2009 to 2019, that phenomenon had reversed. “Such an outcome has not been the norm over Australia’s post-war history. In all previous expansions, the bottom 90% received at least 50% of the economic growth, on a per adult basis,” the paper found. 9.52pm BST Essential workers unable to afford to live alone Soaring rents have made living alone impossible for most of the nation’s essential workers. New research shows some would have to spend about two-thirds of their income to afford a place on their own. Comparing the average weekly unit rents against award wages for 15 essential jobs, the national housing campaign Everybody’s Home found there are virtually no regions of Australia where a single full-time essential worker, such as those in aged care, early childhood or nursing, could afford a to rent by themselves. “So many essential industries are facing workforce shortages, with workers unable to afford to stay or move to parts of the country where these shortages are at their worst,” Everybody’s Home spokesperson Maiy Azize said. For a worker in hospitality or meat-packing to meet the average capital city rent of $572 a week, they would have to spend 81% of their pay on housing; for an aged care worker it would be 77%. Even those on higher pay, like teachers and firefighters, would have to spend 58% of their average pay on rent – well above the 30% threshold for rental stress to afford the average capital city rent. “Our calculations suggest that essential workers in single households are likely to be in serious financial stress with little or no savings buffer, while workers in coupled households are likely to be financially dependent on a partner’s income,” the report said. In the past three years, typical rents across the country have gone up more thsn $100 a week, hitting $489 in March, according to SQM Research. For essential workers, that means they’ve lost an average of six hours from their weekly income – an average of 37 days each year – on rent increases. While the government has promised 20,000 social housing properties in five years, as part of its Housing Australia Future Fund, it will not match the scale of the crisis, Azize said. “The federal government must start building 25,000 social homes every year to end our shortfall,” she said. “That will help workers in severe rental stress, and free up affordable rentals for everyone else. The government can fund those social homes by winding back handouts for investors and landlords.” 9.30pm BST Welcome Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll be bringing you some of the top stories before my colleague takes the reins. Our lead story this morning concerns the Australian army’s response to the Brereton inquiry into alleged war crimes. Guardian Australia has learned from a freedom of information request that the culture within the special forces will be reviewed regularly from now on. In addition, the defence force will update its policy on time away from the battlefield to ease stress. Our data and business experts have teamed up with the research firm CoreLogic to track house prices in the wealthiest suburbs and we’ve found that values have fallen almost 25% in some areas, led by Mona Vale in Sydney’s north and Kew East in Melbourne. Check it all out here. And we have another exclusive from our higher education reporter, Caitlin Cassidy, on the troubled state of Australia’s universities. A senior academic from a leading university tells her they are in crisis and have “completely lost their sense of direction”, with cost-cutting, casualisation and “ridiculous” teaching loads to blame. Also in this morning’s news, the national housing campaign Everybody’s Home has found there are virtually no regions of Australia where a single full-time essential worker, such as those in aged care, early childhood or nursing, could afford a rental by themselves. And a new paper from the Australia Institute shows 93% of the benefits of economic growth between 2009 and 2019 went to the top 10%, while the bottom 90% received just 7%. That’s because wages are going backwards in real terms, and it’s only the people who benefit from surging corporate profits who are getting ahead.

After retiring as chief executive of Siemens UK three years ago, the industrialist has been hard at work in his office overlooking the garden of his detached Edwardian home. With Britain’s economy close to recession, a cost of living crisis, global heating, a green transition, Brexit and deep regional divisions, there are plenty of problems he wants to fix. Having moved the Siemens UK headquarters to Manchester in one of his final acts before retiring, and become vice-chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, Maier is one of the leading voices pushing to level up the UK’s lopsided regional economy. “We are in the deepest series of crises any of us in our professional careers have ever experienced,” he says. “Yet, at the same time, we find ourselves with the worst possible relationship between business and government. It really is that bad.” Rather than tax cuts or a bonfire of regulation in next week’s budget, he says, Rishi Sunak’s government ought to wake up and recognise that this isn’t the way to run a 21st-century economy. Rather than a “1980s playbook”, it should be working for closer ties between business and government, better relations with unions, and a clear industrial strategy. He admits our conversation is “a bit of a whingeing session”, but there is a purpose to it. Since leaving Siemens after 33 years, Maier has started vocL, an app-based business mentoring and speaking platform. Siemens, John Lewis, Sainsbury’s, Timpsons, Arup and Brompton Bikes are all on board, keen to foster the next generation of bosses willing to speak out on big political issues. None of what was in [Liz Truss’s] mini budget was being called for by business. How did business stand by and allow it to happen? “We think the future will be a different political landscape,” he says. “I’m not trying to predict the outcome of a general election, but whoever assembles a government will draw the conclusion that they need a better relationship with business. We want to equip the business leaders of the future with the tools, knowledge and, frankly, moral courage to engage in a positive political and private sector relationship.” For years, he says, company chiefs have largely ducked the public sphere, preferring to stay silent on the big issues. Now Maier wants them to speak up. He uses Liz Truss’s “dreadful” mini-budget to highlight the importance of doing so. “None of what was in that mini-budget was being called for by business. How did business stand by and allow it to happen? We need to be at the top table, helping create policies that are good for business and society.” Maier is adept at practising what he preaches. He talks 19 to the dozen, is full of stories and, as a regular panellist on BBC Question Time, clearly isn’t afraid of a robust debate – not least when it comes to Brexit, of which he is an outspoken critic. Business support for Rishi Sunak’s “Windsor framework” Northern Ireland deal is strong, he says. “It’s a return to a sensible conversation … and provides some confidence that we’re moving in the right direction.” Despite this, Maier thinks a wider campaign to rejoin the EU is still years away: “We’re miles from that, honestly. And I don’t believe that is where business is at all.” European ties are second nature for Maier, a proud Anglo-Austrian. His home is full of signs of his dual heritage: Austrian wine in the fridge, walls adorned with a painting of the Wörthersee (where he has a second home in the Alps), plus framed prints of Manchester landmarks. Born in 1964 in Germany to Austrian parents, he moved to Leeds aged 10 after his mother remarried an Englishman from County Durham. Starting school as a “foreigner” who couldn’t speak English, and realising he was gay, made for a tough start. “It was awful, to be honest. I had to learn quickly.” He remembers after-school fights between boys from his comprehensive – Allerton Grange in the suburb of Moortown – and a local rival, surreptitiously helped by a PE teacher who taught boxing. “It’s now sort of the Didsbury of Leeds,” he says of the area where his mother still lives, meaning it’s fairly affluent. “But when I came to the UK it certainly wasn’t.” When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, he and a friend jumped in his battered car and drove there to witness the moment. ‘I just wanted to see it. I wanted to be a part of history. And it was fascinating’ His degree in engineering at Trent Polytechnic (now Nottingham Trent University) was sponsored by Siemens, and he did an industrial placement there before starting as graduate engineer in 1986 at its factory in Congleton, Cheshire. As Maier was growing up, northern England’s industrial backbone was crumbling. “It’s why I’m so passionate about these things. I want to be part of the generation that improved that,” he says. And there is a lot to be learned from Germany’s approach: “The scale, the gravitas, the long-termism, the strategic intent. And the business partnership with government.” When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, he and a friend jumped in his battered Ford Granada and drove from Congleton to witness the moment. “I just wanted to see it,” he says. “I wanted to be a part of history. And it was fascinating.” Related: Pfizer’s Susan Rienow: from Covid to fighting the ‘silent pandemic’ Maier recalls that during die Wende (the turn), as the reunification period is known, Siemens loaned some top employees to the German government to help in piecing the country back together. The UK could learn lessons on close partnership between government and industry, but will it? “There’s the odd minister, you know, with the right intent,” he says. But the big danger is that without a consistent plan, regional divisions will remain, and Britain will fall behind as other countries steal a march in building the green economy of the future. Although he won’t be drawn on how he votes, he says Labour clearly has a better relationship with business. His big ask is that any government develops and sticks to a proper industrial strategy: “I don’t care what you call it. Let’s just have something sustainable. It’s about confidence, long-termism and partnership.” CV Age 59. Family Lives with his husband, Richard, and their dachshund, Max, in Didsbury, Manchester.

Throughout this process, I asked British leaders every day –from all the parties, [Nigel] Farage, trade unions or the business community – to give me proof for the added value of Brexit. Nobody was able to do this.” Barnier has been taking to the UK airwaves in the last week to promote his diaries of those fractious talks, in which he repeatedly used his “ticking clock” metaphor to highlight the position Britain found itself in as it prepared for life outside the EU. The clock has now ticked on three years. Barnier is struck by the difference in the debate between the UK and the rest of the continent. “To be frank, coming back to London, I see that Brexit is always on the front page,” he says. “There are many questions and many polls, but it’s not the case in the EU. Brexit is no longer a problem for us. We have turned the page.” We were told we’d have a lot more money in the UK. Actually, we were totally mis-sold Caller, BBC 5 Live Sure enough, the third Brexit anniversary last week did see a resurgence of discussion about that momentous, iconoclastic decision. Yet there are signs that it is a different debate to the one that engulfed the UK before Brexit took place. Radio phone-ins once dominated by shrill, entrenched campaigners contained case studies of Brexit’s banal complications. BBC Radio 5 Live’s breakfast programme heard from a nursery owner, a sheep farmer, a transport company boss and a pet food company about the complexities of cross-border trade. “I actually voted for Brexit, and I’ve got my own reasons for that – I want the UK to be in charge of our own laws,” said Alison, a caller whose business works with manufacturers. “We were told we’d have a lot more money in the UK. Actually, we were totally mis-sold.” Others who voted for Brexit talked of incompetent ministers or a failure of the ruling elite to “get behind” the concept. As if to bring home the realities of life outside the bloc, Brexit’s anniversary celebrations coincided with a warning from the International Monetary Fund that Britain will be the only major industrialised country to see its economy shrink this year – and perform even worse than sanctions-hit Russia. So, three years after Britain’s EU departure, is the country coming to the same conclusion about the benefits of Brexit that figures like Barnier expressed from the start? Remain campaigners have sensed “Bregret” in the air ever since 2016, but pollsters do now suggest that around one in five leave voters have changed their minds. Over the past few months, the proportion of voters who want to rejoin the EU has risen to about 58%, while the proportion of those wanting to stay out has fallen to around 42%. Michel Barnier speaking at an event in London last week. Photograph: David Tett/Shutterstock Behind the shift, according to analysts, is evidence that voters have become more negative about the economic effects of Brexit, both on the country and on their own personal finances. As recently as 2021, more people thought Brexit would have a beneficial economic effect, whereas the net figure is now -27%. The IMF’s missive last week added grist to that mill. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said other countries were not being affected to the same extent as the UK by shortages of labour. The UK labour force, he said, had half a million fewer people than before the pandemic, as a result of people retiring early and fewer EU immigrants. “That’s not affecting any other country in Europe … it’s a particular challenge for us,” he said. The continuing “challenges from Brexit” and the rapid impact of higher interest rates on mortgage costs were also factors, he said. Research by the Centre for European Reform (CER) in December showed that Britain’s economy was 5.5% smaller than it would have been had it remained inside the EU. The UK’s goods trade was 7% lower, and investment 11% down on what it would have been had the remain campaign won in 2016. The Office for Budget Responsibility stands by a prediction that Brexit will cause a long hit to GDP per capita of 4%. Pro-Brexit economic arguments have become thin on the ground. *** As UK public opinion turns, the attractiveness to voters in other member states of their nations quitting the EU, which rose around the time of the referendum in 2016, has declined markedly. The European Social Survey (ESS), led by City, University of London, found respondents were less likely to want to leave than in 2016-17 in every EU member state for which data was available. Remain campaign veterans believe that the drip, drip of data has persuaded media organisations once reluctant to attribute such negative effects to Brexit to raise more questions. Last Tuesday, the BBC, criticised by some remainers for staying out of the debate for too long, led its news bulletins on the IMF intervention and held a special Brexit debate during which remainer Alastair Campbell was regularly cheered and leaver Jacob Rees-Mogg often jeered. While boasts of Brexit’s positive economic impact have subsided, it would be wrong to say that prominent Brexiters have had a change of heart. The arguments deployed, however, have shifted. Many pro-Brexit figures now readily admit that economic problems are a byproduct, at least for now. Instead of economic boosterism, three broad arguments are deployed: that it is too early to judge Brexit, that it has been implemented badly and that Brexit was only ever a question of sovereignty. Empty shelves in a London supermarket due to post-Brexit supply chain disruption. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Lord Moylan, a Tory peer and former adviser to Boris Johnson, says an economic hit should come as no surprise. “The negotiations were appallingly handled, but as far as Great Britain is concerned, Brexit is now complete,” he says. “Brexit was a constitutional change, and it’s been achieved. We’re not subject to European Union laws and make our own laws. That’s what Brexit is all about, and it has been done. If you leave a customs union, you’re going to trade less. It’s obvious. Why would anybody be surprised about that? Inevitably, it would have an effect on trade. I didn’t think the European Union would be so unpleasant about the whole thing, but obviously I was naive about that.” Brexit was supposed to be the beginning of the hard work. It wasn’t ‘Get Brexit done, and it’s done’ Jeremy Hosking Jeremy Hosking, a former Tory donor who also handed large sums to Vote Leave, lays the blame for Brexit’s progress at the feet of the government. “Like many people with a Conservative disposition, I would say it’s been very disappointing so far, but obviously the politicians and business leaders have had many other things on their mind,” he says. “What I’ve concluded is that we’re living in an era where the politicians aren’t really interested in serving the long-term interests of the people. ‘Brexit’ is now a slogan. ‘Get Brexit done.’ Brexit was supposed to be the beginning of the hard work. It wasn’t ‘Get Brexit done, and it’s done’. There is a read across from this to all other areas of public policy as far as I can see, but nothing is happening. There’s no problem-solving in any dimension. It doesn’t matter whether it’s health, education, trade deals, there’s no progress anywhere.” Lord Edmiston, the Tory donor who gave £1m to the Brexit campaign, said it was never likely to be smooth in the short term and that hiccups were to be expected and we should judge it after a decade. “Brexit for me was a decision about democracy and the ability to make our own laws, control our own borders, and trade with who we wished,” he said. “It was never undertaken as a short-term measure. A change like that after more than 40 years was never going to be achieved without a few bumps in the road. “Given the fact we were immediately plunged into Covid and subsequently the Ukraine war, it is actually surprising how relatively smoothly things have gone. This decision will be best viewed after 10 years have passed. Related: Yes, the mood has shifted against Brexit. But the road back to Brussels is long and hard “Other countries like New Zealand and Australia had to make major adjustments to their economies after the EU limited our ability to trade with them. They made those adjustments and came out stronger – so will the UK if we commit to it and stop looking back over our shoulders.” Politically, the Brexit effect now spells trouble for Sunak from several directions. Gone is one of the pillars that Tory MPs credit for delivering election success in 2019 – by most accounts, Tory strategists believe that if Brexit is an issue at the local elections, it won’t be to the benefit of their party. Some Brexiters also said that it was the misfiring of Brexit that – inexplicably to many in the party – was keeping Liz Truss relevant. This weekend, the former prime minister will make her first big intervention, heaping pressure on Sunak to cut taxes and deregulate. Despite her complete implosion, some Tories conclude that her high risk, low tax programme is the only logical strategy for making a success of life outside a big trading bloc.

Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/Shutterstock “I always thought Brexit had the capacity to hit the existing party system, and Labour ran into that head-first. But the same articulated lorry is now about to collide with the Tory party,” said one veteran Conservative Brexiter. Meanwhile, new Brexit skirmishes are set to break out this week as the plan to remove all EU laws from the statute book is debated in parliament. Soon after that, a deal with the EU over the treatment of Northern Ireland again threatens a fresh battle. Related: Brexit causes collapse in European research funding for Oxbridge Yet the problems emerging with the current Brexit settlement also heap pressure on Keir Starmer and Labour. While the Labour leader has talked about taking on the “Brexit purity cult” in the Tory party, greater evidence of economic damage will increase pressure on him to bring the UK closer to the EU. That risks undoing his largely successful drive to steer his party away from the Brexit splits that caused such problems for Labour at the last election. It all allows Barnier to adopt a more-in-sorrow-than-anger tone as he surveys the continuing fallout, but he adds a warning for remainers who hope that one day an EU return could be contemplated. The further the two parties drift apart, the harder any return will become. “I wish the best for the UK, sincerely,” he says. “I admire this country, with respect for many of the UK’s leaders – first of all, Winston Churchill. I admire the culture of the UK, the capacity to play a role in the world. But Brexit is a lose-lose game … [it] has been, is and will remain a lose-lose game. “The door is open. The difficulty could be that the gap is created, starting from now into the future in our regulations. If there is too large a divergence, it could be more difficult. But once again, this is a choice for the UK.”","Id":"politics/2023/feb/05/trade-down-economy-sinking-support-falling-is-the-tide-finally-turning-on-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Trade down, economy sinking, support falling: is the tide finally turning on Brexit?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/05/trade-down-economy-sinking-support-falling-is-the-tide-finally-turning-on-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/feb/05/trade-down-economy-sinking-support-falling-is-the-tide-finally-turning-on-brexit","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":1882,"webPublicationDate":"2023-02-05T07:00:16Z","hosted":false,"id":"politics/2023/feb/05/trade-down-economy-sinking-support-falling-is-the-tide-finally-turning-on-brexit"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Leo Varadkar nightclub footage triggers privacy debate in Ireland","body":"A video of Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s tánaiste, socialising in a nightclub has triggered a debate about the right to privacy and regulation of social media. The brief clip of the deputy prime minister was clandestinely recorded in a Dublin nightclub earlier this month and has racked up millions of views on multiple platforms. Varadkar told reporters this week he did not wish to comment on a personal matter but hinted at regret. “Everyone makes errors in judgment. You wouldn’t be a human being if you didn’t.” He defended his record in office, saying he got the big calls – the Covid pandemic, Brexit, the economy – right. The taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin, branded the video a violation of his colleague’s right to a private life. Martin said pending legislation would create Ireland’s first social media regulator and that new EU directives would tighten the rules for tech firms that operated such platforms. Individual users also needed to be held accountable, he told the Irish Independent. “We are now entering into a new era where there’ll be far more regulation of social media platforms.” Varadkar, 43, came out as gay in 2015 and has been accompanied by his partner, Matt Barrett, at official engagements. Under the ruling coalition’s power-sharing agreement the Fine Gael leader is to take over from Martin as taoiseach – a role Varadkar held in the previous government – this weekend. The video, reportedly taken at a gay nightclub in central Dublin, went viral last week but mainstream media ignored it out of respect for Varadkar’s privacy. However, after TikTok removed the video several media outlets reported the company’s decision, and Martin and Varadkar spoke out about people’s right to privacy. Some commentators on social media accused Irish media of double standards in reporting the private lives of politicians and public figures in other countries while shielding politicians and public figures in Ireland. Others said Varadkar, as an incoming head of government, had a responsibility to be mindful when in public spaces. An Irish Independent editorial said on Tuesday: “An uncomfortable truth accompanying any degree of fame is that your privacy diminishes in proportion to the elevation in status. The debate around whether this is fair or not has almost become irrelevant. It has merely been accepted as the way things are.” A leaked video of the Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, dancing and drinking with friends at a private residence prompted a similar debate in August.","Id":"world/2022/dec/13/leo-varadkar-nightclub-footage-triggers-privacy-debate-in-ireland-social-media-regulation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Leo Varadkar nightclub footage triggers privacy debate in Ireland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/13/leo-varadkar-nightclub-footage-triggers-privacy-debate-in-ireland-social-media-regulation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/13/leo-varadkar-nightclub-footage-triggers-privacy-debate-in-ireland-social-media-regulation","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":413,"webPublicationDate":"2022-12-13T12:47:35Z","hosted":false,"id":"world/2022/dec/13/leo-varadkar-nightclub-footage-triggers-privacy-debate-in-ireland-social-media-regulation"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Abortion rights take centre stage as Oz and Fetterman clash in Pennsylvania Senate debate","body":"Abortion rights took centre stage during the debate for Pennsylvania’s US Senate seat on Tuesday night, as Mehmet Oz, a celebrity doctor and the Republican candidate, said decisions over abortion should be left to “women, doctors, local political leaders”, while John Fetterman, the Democratic candidate, criticised the GOP’s hardline stance. The debate in Harrisburg started with Oz, a former surgeon and long-time host of the Dr Oz television show, discussing his desire to make “Washington civil again”. The Trump-backed Republican said he wanted to “unify, not divide”. But Oz was soon reverting to a 2022 Republican playbook that has been characterised by pugnacity in races across the US, as he referred to Fetterman, Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor, as a “left-wing extremist” who had “radical positions”. Related: Are Democrats messing up their midterm messaging? Our panel responds It set the tone for a contentious evening as the pair clashed over abortion, Pennsylvania’s minimum wage – which at $7.25 is lower than each of its six bordering states – and the economy, in what has become one of the closest-watched elections in the US. Fetterman and Oz are vying to replace Pat Toomey, a retiring Republican, and with the Senate evenly divided between the two parties, both are desperate to win in a state that Joe Biden picked up by 80,000 votes in 2020. This was Fetterman’s highest-profile appearance of the campaign, since he suffered a stroke in mid-May, which has left him with auditory processing issues, where the brain struggles to understand the spoken word. To accommodate Fetterman’s condition, which he said is improving daily, two 70-inch monitors were placed above the heads of the moderators, which showed the transcribed text of their questions, and the text of Oz’s responses. John Fetterman participated in the debate with the assistance of monitors that showed transcribed texts of questions and responses. Photograph: Greg Nash/EPA “Let’s also talk about the elephant in the room,” Fetterman said in his opening remarks. “I had a stroke. He [Oz] never let me forget that.” The Democrat was referring to the Republican’s campaign which has launched unsavory attacks against Fetterman, with one Oz aide, Rachel Tripp, claiming Fetterman might not have had a stroke if he “had ever eaten a vegetable in his life”. In August Oz’s campaign released what it said were “concessions” it was prepared to make during a debate with Fetterman, which included a promise to “pay for any additional medical personnel he might need to have on standby”. Oz has since tried to distance himself from the tone of his campaign, but said on Fox Business recently: “I don’t think there’s closed captioning on the floor of the Senate.” Fetterman, 53, released a report from his doctor last week that said he “has no work restrictions and can work full duty in public office”, but the doctor noted that Fetterman has difficulty processing some words. In a TV interview in early October, Fetterman said he will sometimes miss words, or “mush” words together when speaking, and there were times when his issues with speech were noticeable during the debate. The Democrat appeared to struggle to find certain words and took longer than Oz to reply to questions as he read captioning on screen. “It knocked me down but I’m going to keep coming back up,” Fetterman said of the stroke on Tuesday. “And this campaign is all about, to me is about fighting for everyone in Pennsylvania that ever got knocked down that needs to get back up.” The pair were asked about abortion early in the debate. Nationally, Democrats have drawn attention to Republicans’ role in the landmark Roe v Wade decision being overturned in June this year. Republicans, particularly in politically moderate states like Pennsylvania, have sought to avoid the issue. Oz was asked: “Should abortion be banned in America”, but declined to answer directly, suggesting instead that “there should not be involvement from the federal government”, and that states should be able to decide their own abortion law. “I want women, doctors, local political leaders, letting the democracy that’s always allowed our nation to thrive, to put the best ideas forward so states can decide for themselves,” Oz said, in remarks that were immediately derided online. Fetterman said he would “fight to re-establish” Roe v Wade, which he said “should be the law”. “If you believe that the choice of your reproductive freedom belongs with Dr Oz, then you have a choice. But if you believe that the choice for abortion belongs with you and your doctor, that’s what I fight for,” the Democrat said. Fetterman, who spent 13 years as mayor of Braddock, a small borough outside Pittsburgh, rose to national fame in the aftermath of the 2020 election, when as Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor he vigorously rebuffed Trump’s claims of voter fraud, at one point referring to the then president as “no different than any other random internet troll”. He has also attracted attention for his atypical – for a politician – appearance. At 6ft 8in tall, Fetterman is usually seen wearing hoodies at campaign events, and has tattoos on his forearms, including nine on his right arm which mark the dates that people were killed “through violence” in Braddock while he was mayor. John Fetterman has attracted attention for his informal style while campaigning. Photograph: Kriston Jae Bethel/AFP/Getty Images Oz is best known for hosting the Dr Oz Show, a daytime TV program about medical issues which, he said on Tuesday, “ruffled a lot of feathers”. The show also promoted fad treatments and ineffective products and Oz has been repeatedly dubbed a “snake oil salesman”. In 2014 he was asked to appear before a Senate committee, where he was berated by senators over his promotion of “miracle” diet pills that the medical community agreed do not work. The Fetterman campaign had tried to temper expectations ahead of the debate, and released a memo on Monday saying that debate “isn’t John’s format”, pointing out that some had been underwhelmed by Fetterman’s performance in debates during the Democratic primary this spring. “John is five months post-stroke and Oz has spent the last two decades literally in a TV studio; if there’s a home-field advantage, it’s definitely his,’’ Rebecca Katz, Fetterman’s communications adviser, told the New York Times. At times Fetterman’s speaking did hold him back, but he rebutted Republicans’ suggestions – repeated through countless TV ads in the state – that he was “soft on crime”, pointing to successes in bringing down gun crime in Braddock. Oz, Fetterman said, “has never made any attempt to try to address crime during his entire career except showing up for photo ops here in Philadelphia.” On the minimum wage, Oz said “market forces” would raise Pennsylvania’s minimum wage of $7.25 – the lowest amount allowed under federal law and an amount, when adjusted for inflation, which is the lowest minimum wage in decades. Fetterman said he “absolutely” supports the proposal to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, adding: “I think it’s a disgrace at $7.25 an hour.” As the debate drew to a close, both candidates were asked about their parties’ potential candidates for the 2024 presidential election. Fetterman said he would support Biden if the president ran again. In a tacit acknowledgement of Trump’s divisiveness and deep unpopularity in parts of the country, Oz was initially less equivocal, saying only that he would “support whoever the Republican party puts up”. A moderator reminded viewers that Trump had endorsed Oz – an action Trump rarely bestows on those likely to disappoint him – and asked Oz why he wouldn’t return that support. That prompted Oz, perhaps mindful of the notoriously emotional and combustible nature of his backer, to clarify his position. “Oh I do,” Oz said. “I would support Donald Trump if he decided to run for president.”","Id":"us-news/2022/oct/26/pennsylvania-senate-debate-mehmet-oz-john-fetterman","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"Abortion rights take centre stage as Oz and Fetterman clash in Pennsylvania Senate debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/26/pennsylvania-senate-debate-mehmet-oz-john-fetterman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/oct/26/pennsylvania-senate-debate-mehmet-oz-john-fetterman","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":1247,"webPublicationDate":"2022-10-26T03:49:21Z","hosted":false,"id":"us-news/2022/oct/26/pennsylvania-senate-debate-mehmet-oz-john-fetterman"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Morning Mail: Putin cyberwarfare plans exposed, debate over minimum wage, Aston to test Dutton","body":"Good morning, on the last day of March.

Despite basic service delivery being the bread and butter of local governments, a suburban Melbourne council has attracted the fiery frustration of residents over a decision to separate charges for rubbish collection from its general rates. At a Yarra city council meeting on Tuesday night, residents from an area known for its community activism protested against a new waste levy charge for ratepayers being passed. In the eyes of disgruntled residents, the separate levy – which is also applied by various councils across Victoria and in some other states – is a “bin tax”. The council argues it is a financial necessity amid the costs associated with the state government’s new four-bin waste and recycling scheme, in line with other parts of Australia. Adam Promnitz, the founder of the Yarra Residents Collective, which has been central to the pushback, claims the council concealed a cash grab to circumvent state-imposed rates caps and criticises the lack of consultation. “They’re not just going and putting this surcharge in out of good faith,” he says. “The only reason they are doing this is to get around the rate capping.” We’ve got disillusioned Greens voters, Labor and Liberal voters. It really is from right across the spectrum Adam Promnitz, Yarra Residents Collective The Andrews government’s rates cap will force ratepayers to fork out an extra 3.5% in costs from July – less than the current rate of inflation of 7.4%. By separating the waste charge from general rates, councils are able to increase revenue beyond the cap. Guidelines from the Essential Services Commission stipulate that the revenue can only be used to cover the cost of providing waste and recycling services in the area. A Monash University Sustainable Development Institute researcher, Jennifer Macklin, who specialises in Australia’s waste industry, says the model being adopted by the council is essentially a basic user-pays model but differs from a weight-based charging model. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “A strong user-pays model would see you paying based on how much you use, just like with electricity and water, meaning those who produce more waste [by weight] pay more for their waste service,” she says. “Instead, the Yarra approach – which is standard across Victoria, South Australia and NSW – is a flat rate which involves people who don’t produce as much waste subsidising people who do produce a lot. I suspect that is as far as Australia will go with user-pays. I’ve not yet seen any council in Australia with the appetite to try a weight-based system, though some overseas places have successfully implemented such a model.” Macklin says there is also likely to be a disconnect between the public’s expectations of waste collection and the changed financial landscape since China effectively banned the importation of most rubbish in 2018. “Up until recently, China paid really good money for our household recycling,” she says. In Yarra Promnitz stresses that the residents’ concerns are above ideology, with the collective made up of people from across the political divide: “We’ve been accused of being far right and far left. We’ve got disillusioned Greens voters, Labor and Liberal voters. It really is from right across the spectrum.” Related: Queenslanders to be banned from dumping solar panels in landfill under new recycling program The Yarra council’s waste charge will be calculated based on property value, with ratepayers who do not receive a kerbside service exempt from the charge. A spokesperson for the council says the decision had been implemented to tackle the rising cost of providing waste services and “ensure council’s ongoing financial sustainability”. Opponents to the move, including three councillors who voted against it, say the council should not pass on the charge to residents and should rein in internal spending. An independent Yarra councillor, Stephen Jolly – who has led the opposition against the levy – told Guardian Australia the fact that other councils have implemented their own charges is not a satisfactory excuse to do so in his area. “We’re the most progressive, most leftwing council and we’ve always been a trailblazer,” he says. “We spend half the time telling everyone we’re the best in the world, most progressive, and then when it suits them, the same people can say, ‘Oh, well, they’ve got someone else doing it.’” Jolly argues the levy could create a slippery slope where a user-pays model is used for other services such as swimming pools. Another independent Yarra councillor, Herschel Landes – who voted in support of the measure – says the conversation should focus on the collective duty to reduce the burden of waste management. “I would have liked to have seen some of the anger last night directed towards the manufacturers of the waste in the first instance,” he says.","Id":"australia-news/2023/mar/16/putting-up-a-stink-revolt-against-a-melbourne-councils-levy-starts-debate-about-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Putting up a stink: revolt against a Melbourne council’s levy starts debate about waste","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/16/putting-up-a-stink-revolt-against-a-melbourne-councils-levy-starts-debate-about-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/16/putting-up-a-stink-revolt-against-a-melbourne-councils-levy-starts-debate-about-waste","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":772,"webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T14:00:12Z","hosted":false,"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/16/putting-up-a-stink-revolt-against-a-melbourne-councils-levy-starts-debate-about-waste"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Rivals hammer out their pitches in fiery first debate of NSW election campaign","body":"For the bleary-eyed listeners who tuned into Sydney’s 2GB radio station on Thursday morning, a treat: two state political leaders talking over one another about the merits of privatising public assets to pay for infrastructure projects, and whether public-sector wages caps are a good idea. The first debate of the New South Wales election campaign, between the premier, Dominic Perrottet, and the opposition leader, Chris Minns, was fiery without any real flashpoint. Related: Dominic Perrottet gambles on poker machine reform as a vote winner The curious format – which saw both leaders ask each other three questions while being allowed to interject and interrupt each other, with the host, Ben Fordham, only occasionally intervening – did offer an insight into the pitches both leaders are honing as NSW approaches the polls. Perrottet used his time to make the same rhetorical point, asking Minns whether he would have built major infrastructure projects such as WestConnex and the Sydney Metro if Labor had been in government and to explain how he would he have paid for them. The point was twofold: to remind 2GB’s listeners of the government’s record; and to suggest infrastructure spending would come to a halt under Labor. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup During its 12 years in power, the Coalition’s playbook has been to use the proceeds of privatised public assets – such as the state electricity network – to pay for major infrastructure. It’s proved a vote winner in the past but Labor is going to this election promising to end privatisation. It points to the costs of those privatisations for voters – such as the extensive tolling network across Sydney’s motorways – and the damage to state revenue from the sale of public assets. The Coalition was “flogging off the family jewels and home” to pay for the credit card bill, Minns said, pointing to the state’s $11.4bn deficit. “You refuse to acknowledge that the M4, for example, will be paid off six times over,” as a result of privatised toll road payments, Minns said to Perrottet during the debate. While Perrottet said he has “no plans” for any sales of public assets, he also would not rule out further privatisation. But the premier is keen to remind voters of the previous NSW Labor government’s record on infrastructure, and Minns was loath to say whether infrastructure projects would be funded by increasing debt. Instead he said infrastructure could be paid for through dividends from state-owned organisations. Perrottet scoffed at that suggestion, questioning whether Labor’s removal of a public-sector wages cap would also hurt the budget bottom line and accusing Minns of wanting to run the economy “like a school tuckshop”. “[Sydney Metro is] an $18.5bn project ... you can’t build those projects on dividends,” he said. Minns stuck to his favoured territory: funding for the NSW health and education sectors, and the overseas procurement of transport assets which have led to some projects – such as the Sydney light rail – being beset by problems. “The current government doesn’t believe in Australian-made,” Minns said. On poker machine reform, where Perrottet has unveiled plans for a cashless gaming card while Minns has plumped only for a trial, Fordham asked the premier why previous governments had not taken on the clubs sector. “Politics,” he said. Expect plenty more of that over the next six weeks.","Id":"australia-news/2023/feb/09/rivals-hammer-out-their-pitches-in-fiery-first-debate-of-nsw-election-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Rivals hammer out their pitches in fiery first debate of NSW election campaign","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/09/rivals-hammer-out-their-pitches-in-fiery-first-debate-of-nsw-election-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/feb/09/rivals-hammer-out-their-pitches-in-fiery-first-debate-of-nsw-election-campaign","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":548,"webPublicationDate":"2023-02-09T01:18:17Z","hosted":false,"id":"australia-news/2023/feb/09/rivals-hammer-out-their-pitches-in-fiery-first-debate-of-nsw-election-campaign"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"First Truss-Sunak Tory leadership debate: five key takeaways","body":"After a weekend of rancorous briefings against each other, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak faced each other during an hour-long live TV debate from Stoke-on-Trent. Here are five key takeaways, on a night where Sunak seemed as assured as ever, but Truss did not do anything to significantly harm her chances. Indeed, one of the few rounds of applause from the audience came when she simply said she was not the slickest performer. The gloves stayed off The former Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis had decried the TV debate format as too aggressive, and the former Tory chair Francis Maude warned both candidates against trashing the brand, but there was no love lost. Truss and Sunak constantly interrupted each other on tax, clashed over who had supported “Project Fear”, and it was difficult to believe that just three weeks ago they were ministerial colleagues in the same government under Boris Johnson. At the end they both said they could work together in government again, but nobody believed it. Related: ‘FFS Nadine! Muted’: fears Truss-Sunak race is plunging into horrific nastiness Sunak is trying to make tax-and-spend a moral issue The former chancellor talked about Truss wanting to put Covid debt on the never-never, and asked whether it was “moral” to leave debt to be paid off by children and grandchildren, bringing out the idea that the country has a credit card and saying the policy was un-Conservative. Truss hit back by saying again that Covid was a once-in-a-century event, and that no other major economy was trying to raise tax to pay off the debt so fast. Polling suggests she has the lead with the Tory membership, and it is very possible her “feel” about how to repay debt will win their hearts over Sunak’s harder-nosed fiscal approach. The backstory is a big thing The BBC studio audience was made up of people who voted Conservative in a so-called red wall seat in 2019, and the audience wanted to know what levelling up meant for them locally. The candidates reiterated their commitment to the project, but also spent a lot of time detailing their upbringings, revealing their keenness to burnish their “salt of the earth” credentials. Sunak helping his mother’s business and Truss and her comprehensive school education inevitably got mentioned. China is an ongoing battleground Truss trumpeted her tough stance on China, and said we should not make the same mistake we made with Russia. Sunak pointed out that Truss once said we were entering a “golden age” with China. The open question from the BBC’s economic editor was: are you really committed to cracking down on our biggest individual import partner? Neither candidate really had the answer to that hard question. Ukraine featured too. Both were proud of their record in government of supporting Ukraine. Both ruled out the Royal Navy actively engaging in the Black Sea. The environment finally got a mention The two candidates were asked what they thought the three most important things were that people could do for the environment. Sunak said his children were the experts, and cited energy efficiency, recycling and a faith in British innovation to solve problems. Truss, who often tries to smudge her Liberal Democrat past, said she was “a teenage eco-warrior before it was fashionable”.","Id":"politics/2022/jul/25/first-truss-sunak-tory-leadership-debate-five-key-takeaways","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"First Truss-Sunak Tory leadership debate: five key takeaways","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/25/first-truss-sunak-tory-leadership-debate-five-key-takeaways","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/25/first-truss-sunak-tory-leadership-debate-five-key-takeaways","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":535,"webPublicationDate":"2022-07-25T20:57:13Z","hosted":false,"id":"politics/2022/jul/25/first-truss-sunak-tory-leadership-debate-five-key-takeaways"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Elderly man who sparked renewed debate of youth crime dies in Queensland hospital","body":"An elderly man whose hospitalisation renewed political debate over youth crime in Queensland has died. Queensland police said the 75-year-old North Toowoomba man died from his injuries on Monday, after he was taken to hospital in a critical condition last week. Police will allege he was pushed from behind and had his backpack taken while he was waiting at a taxi rank on 6 February. An 18-year-old man, 17-year-old boy and two 16-year-old boys were initially charged with grievous bodily harm but police said they are expected to have their charges upgraded following the results of a postmortem report. The man’s death comes as state government ministers prepare to meet at a community forum in Toowoomba on Wednesday night. The police minister, Mark Ryan, the youth justice minister, Leanne Linard, and the police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, are expected to attend. Related: Former LNP leader calls for 72-hour limit on children being held in Queensland watch houses A series of high-profile youth crime cases in recent weeks, and revelations about overflowing youth detention centres, have placed enormous pressure on the Palaszczuk government. On Monday Queensland’s opposition leader, David Crisafulli, backed calls to limit the time children can be held in adult watch houses amid disturbing reports of kids spending weeks in the adult facilities. Speaking with the Guardian last week, the former Liberal National party leader Deb Frecklington said children should be transferred out of watch houses and into temporary accommodation within 72 hours. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Crisafulli said he agreed with his party colleague, who described the ongoing practice of detaining youth in watch houses for weeks as “barbaric”. “What Deb was saying was spot on,” Crisafulli said. “The Queensland police guidelines say that [detaining kids in watch houses] for more than 24 hours should be extraordinary circumstances. “We’ve had dozens of kids detained for several weeks or more since the start of the year … We’re going to line up and keep calling it out because it’s wrong.” Police last week revealed that 88 children were being held in watch houses. Since the start of the year, more than 25 children had spent more than three weeks in watch houses. On Monday Linard said the government aimed to “only hold young people in watch houses for a short period” and that it worked closely with police “to ensure young people are not held in watch houses any longer than required”. We are in the planning stages of increasing youth detention centre infrastructure in Queensland, working in partnership with the Department of State Development, Infrastructure, Local Government and Planning, and in consultation with key government agencies,” Linard said. “Alternate models of detention are being investigated, including smaller facilities that incorporate therapeutic approaches.” The minister also said “there must be consequences” for “serious repeat offenders”. Crisafulli said the state government’s failure to “plan” and “listen” had resulted in all three of the state’s youth detention facilities reaching full capacity. “No one can suggest that locking up kids for several weeks without any form of rehabilitation assists in the long term. That’s a broken system,” Crisafulli said. Related: ‘Disgraceful and gutless’: Queensland deputy premier pilloried for attack on judiciary But the opposition leader also called for breach of bail to be made an offence and criticised legislation brought in by the Palaszczuk government in 2015, which said detention should be a last resort for children. “We’ve got an issue with 17% of young repeat offenders. At the other end of the spectrum lies a generation they are failing in not giving them every chance early on in their journey to crime to turn their life around,” Crisafulli said. On Friday the deputy premier, Steven Miles, said the government was expediting the rollout of the youth detention centres and would look at other temporary solutions. “It was always clear that when we introduced laws – that were tougher, that presumed against bail – that was always going to result in an increase of the number of … young people in detention,” Miles said. Miles was lambasted by lawyers after he criticised a Townsville magistrate’s decision to grant bail to the group of children, dubbing it a “media stunt”.","Id":"australia-news/2023/feb/13/elderly-man-who-sparked-renewed-debate-of-youth-dies-in-queensland-hospital","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Elderly man who sparked renewed debate of youth crime dies in Queensland hospital","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/13/elderly-man-who-sparked-renewed-debate-of-youth-dies-in-queensland-hospital","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/feb/13/elderly-man-who-sparked-renewed-debate-of-youth-dies-in-queensland-hospital","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":680,"webPublicationDate":"2023-02-13T06:56:27Z","hosted":false,"id":"australia-news/2023/feb/13/elderly-man-who-sparked-renewed-debate-of-youth-dies-in-queensland-hospital"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"German government in crisis over EU ban on car combustion engines","body":"Related: The Guardian view on Europe’s green transition: moving to the slow lane? | Editorial A clash over climate protection measures is threatening to unravel Germany’s three-party governing alliance, after the Green party accused its liberal coalition partners of gambling away the country’s reputation by blocking a EU-wide phase-out of internal combustion engines in cars. “You can’t have a coalition of progress where only one party is in charge of progress and the others try to stop the progress,” the country’s vice-chancellor and economy minister, Robert Habeck, said at a meeting of the Green party’s parliamentary group in Weimar on Tuesday. The pro-business Free Democratic party’s (FDP) last-minute opposition to EU plans to ban sales of new cars with internal combustion engines from 2035, which European leaders are hoping to resolve at a summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, had damaged Germany’s standing in the bloc, Habeck said. “We are losing debates, we are getting too little support for our projects.” The German liberals’ sudden rethink has caused frustration not just in the ranks of its coalition partners but in other European capitals, where there are fears that the continent’s largest economy reneging on previously struck agreements will embolden other states to act in a similarly erratic fashion. Related: Germany’s e-fuel EU loophole could mean ‘135bn more litres of petrol burnt’ FDP politicians argue that the phase-out in its current form risks destroying a German manufacturing industry that could in the future offer viable climate-neutral fuels as an alternative to purely battery-powered electric vehicles. “We in Germany master the technology of the combustion engine better than anyone else in the world,” the FDP transport minister, Volker Wissing, said on German television on Wednesday night. “And it makes sense to keep this technology in our hands while some of the questions around climate-neutral mobility remain unanswered.” In a proposed compromise, the European Commission has reportedly suggested criteria for a new category of CO2-neutral fuel-powered vehicles that could remain on European roads after 2035. Wissing’s transport ministry has not yet officially replied to the proposal. To the surprise of its own members, the German Green party had remained relatively reserved in the debate over the combustion engine – until this week, when Habeck’s intervention raised the temperature in Berlin’s seats of power. In a television interview on Tuesday night, the minister for economic affairs and climate action also accused the FDP and his senior coalition partner, the Social Democratic party (SPD) of chancellor Olaf Scholz, of deliberately leaking an early draft of a law banning new fossil fuel heaters in Germany from 2025. In the coalition agreement in December 2021, the three parties had agreed to a ban on installing of new fossil fuel heaters from 2024, with only devices running on 65% renewable energy allowed going forward. With the war in Ukraine bringing a collapse in gas deliveries, that target was supposed to be moved forward, to the start of 2024. Since Habeck’s ministry tried to turn that policy into law, however, there has been a ferocious backlash over its cost to ordinary households, led by the mass tabloid Bild. Habeck said the draft law had been leaked “in order to damage the trust within the government”, which had made him question the other parties’ will to reach a compromise at their scheduled meeting this Sunday. The FDP and the Greens are both struggling in the polls, with the ecological party currently close to the worse-than-anticipated 15% it achieved at federal elections in September 2021. The liberals, meanwhile, are hovering just above the 5% threshold for entering parliament and have lost votes in a string of regional and state elections.","Id":"world/2023/mar/23/german-government-in-crisis-over-eu-ban-on-car-combustion-engines","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"‘We are losing debates’: combustion engine row divides Germany’s coalition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/23/german-government-in-crisis-over-eu-ban-on-car-combustion-engines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/23/german-government-in-crisis-over-eu-ban-on-car-combustion-engines","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":584,"webPublicationDate":"2023-03-23T16:32:45Z","hosted":false,"id":"world/2023/mar/23/german-government-in-crisis-over-eu-ban-on-car-combustion-engines"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Albanese government’s energy bill passes Senate as Dutton warns price caps will be ‘catastrophic’ for economy","body":"The Albanese government’s legislation capping gas prices and funding consumer rebates to deliver power price relief has passed the Senate, despite the Coalition voting against the proposal during a special sitting of federal parliament. Anthony Albanese declared himself “stunned” after the opposition leader Peter Dutton resolved to oppose the package unless the government was prepared to split the legislation to separate the gas price cap from financial help for households. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The prime minister told Sky News “extraordinary times call[ed] for extraordinary measures” and he noted the Sunak government in the United Kingdom had been prepared to pursue “essentially a super profits tax that they are then using to rebate households and businesses in the energy sector”. “I was somewhat stunned, frankly, that Peter Dutton and the opposition were prepared to vote today for higher power prices for both businesses and for households,” Albanese said on Thursday. Related: Peter Dutton’s naked politicking over power prices is as cynical as it is calculating | Katharine Murphy As well as firing a broadside at Dutton, the prime minister also warned the gas industry against “talking down” its prospects – a reference to a furious lobbying effort by producers claiming the proposed government intervention would chill new investment, compounding domestic supply issues. The prime minister dismissed the escalating industry warnings as hyperbolic. “This is a very modest package … a modest intervention that’s required because of the extraordinary circumstances.” “I say this to the sector – they want to be careful that they aren’t talking themselves down because there are big opportunities for future investments.” “If you go out there and you say, oh, this will inhibit investment, this will create issues for us going forward, then you’re essentially talking down your industry, and I see no reason, there’s nothing in this legislation, that should require that sort of conversation.” Labor secured the requisite parliamentary support for the package – which caps gas prices at $12 per gigajoule for 12 months and provides $1.5bn in federal assistance for bill relief – after locking in the Greens and Senate kingmakers David Pocock and the Jacqui Lambie Network. As well as the price cap, the legislation encompasses changes to the gas market code, including a reasonable pricing framework and formal dispute resolution process, with binding arbitration, for the resolution of pre-contractual disputes. Key elements of the intervention are yet to be determined, and both the opposition and some cross benchers were critical of the rushed process for drafting the necessary legislation. Rebates for low and middle income earners will be settled after Christmas after consultation between the federal treasurer and his state counterparts. In order to secure backing for the package, the government has also agreed to fund an accompanying electrification package to help households transition from gas to electric appliances. The details associated with that package are yet to be determined. Dutton characterised the regulatory intervention as “a massive con job” because power bills would continue to increase next year despite the legislated price cap. Government officials have been clear energy prices will continue to rise in 2023, but say the price caps deliver a price reduction in the order of $230, with rebates for eligible customers offering additional support. The Liberal leader said the process of drafting the legislation was “shambolic” because “this plane is still being built mid-air”. Dutton said the policymaking had “all hallmarks of the Rudd-Gillard years”. The opposition leader also decried the price cap intervention as “catastrophic for economic policy in this country” because the signal would chill investment. “These sorts of market interventions don’t just restrict themselves in terms of the impact to the energy sector, there will be other companies in other sectors who are looking to invest here at the moment, who will be looking at the sovereign risk that’s created out of this and questioning whether they will invest in agriculture or whether they’ll invest in the manufacturing, advanced manufacturing, into the healthcare sector,” Dutton said.

The decision to oppose the package was made by the shadow cabinet on Wednesday night and rubber-stamped by the Coalition party room on Thursday morning. During the discussion, the veteran Liberal MP Russell Broadbent suggested it was foolish for the Coalition to try to govern from opposition. The implication of Broadbent’s observation was Australians would see Thursday’s decision as the opposition refusing to deliver power price relief rather than the Coalition standing against government intervention in the gas market on a point of principle.","Id":"australia-news/2022/dec/15/albanese-governments-energy-bill-passes-senate-as-dutton-warns-price-caps-will-be-catastrophic-for-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Albanese government’s energy bill passes Senate as Dutton warns price caps will be ‘catastrophic’ for economy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/15/albanese-governments-energy-bill-passes-senate-as-dutton-warns-price-caps-will-be-catastrophic-for-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/dec/15/albanese-governments-energy-bill-passes-senate-as-dutton-warns-price-caps-will-be-catastrophic-for-economy","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":777,"webPublicationDate":"2022-12-15T06:48:58Z","hosted":false,"id":"australia-news/2022/dec/15/albanese-governments-energy-bill-passes-senate-as-dutton-warns-price-caps-will-be-catastrophic-for-economy"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Will 2023 be a year of muddling through for the UK economy?","body":"Typical. After a round of new year prediction punditry that made one think that 2023 could only be bleaker and weaker than 2022, the FTSE 100 index charged off in the opposite direction. It was up 180 points after two hours of trading to a shade over 7,600, enough to bring the all-time high (7,877, in the faraway pre-Ukraine, pre-Covid days of 2018) into view, a prospect that did not feature heavily in most “what to expect” checklists. By the close, the gain was a more modest 102 points but still out of tune with the general diagnosis that a third of the world would be in recession this year (the IMF) and that the UK’s downturn was likely to be the worst and longest in the G7 (a Financial Times poll of 101 UK economists). Never mistake share price for the real economy, but it’s worth asking the question: is it possible that 2023 could be a tale of muddling through, as opposed to a story of unmitigated financial gloom? If there is a case for relative optimism, it lies in the demonstration over the holiday period that wholesale energy prices can fall as well as rise. A UK month-ahead gas of 179p a therm still looks horrible against a 10-year average of roughly 50p but it’s a lot better than the terrifying 500p seen back in August. Even a few weeks ago, few would have bet that we would enter 2023 with gas prices lower than before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The real test of Europe’s energy resilience lies ahead, it should be added quickly. Blackouts are still possible this winter and, as virtually every energy analyst points out, the biggest challenge is replenishing storage for next winter without Russian supplies. The current lull in wholesale prices could be highly misleading. Alternatively, one can see how lower energy prices may start to ease financial pressure on governments and business. The cost of protecting consumers via price caps falls; bills become lower for companies versus what they were expecting. Central banks’ freedom to hold off on interest rate rises also improves if the energy shock is believed to have passed its most shocking phase. None of which should be taken as a prediction of cheer. The debate is not about the fact of recession – just its severity. But a notable feature of the final few months of 2022 was the number of chief executives in consumer-facing companies who sounded more hopeful about medium-term trading than bald big-picture economic forecasts said they should be. Retailers’ Christmas reports over the next fortnight could puncture that picture in an instant, by delivering a hard reminder of how far cost-of-living pressures reach up the income spectrum. But, for the time being, the muddle-through thesis is intact. The second half of 2023 should be better than the first, which was about as upbeat as the new year forecasts came. One big swing factor – the price of energy – is currently behaving. A lot hangs on whether it continues to do so. Tit-for-tat point-scoring at Cineworld must feel irrelevant to many Recovery in any form is not on the cards for poor old shareholders in Cineworld, however. The once-mighty London-listed cinema group is in chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US and financial realities must be spelled out in every utterance to the stock exchange. Any debt restructuring or sale “will result in a very significant dilution of existing equity interests”, according to Tuesday’s announcement, which has been the refrain since September. So what was the point of the latest statement? Well, it seems that Cineworld has been fuming over its rival AMC Entertainment’s claim to have held talks over cherry-picking a few cinemas in the US and Europe. There were no talks with us, said Cineworld, adding that it “understands” that its ad hoc group of lenders did not talk either. Such is the messy business of chapter 11. Nobody can agree on what constitutes proper talks. The tit-for-tat point-scoring must feel irrelevant to outside shareholders in Cineworld. Rather than listen to the chief executive Mooky Greidinger’s digressions on AMC, they would surely rather hear an explanation as to why a deal with lenders was not attempted last spring when Cineworld still had a share price that offered some negotiating clout. Instead, Greidinger gambled on a strong bounce-back in revenues that never quite materialised. For the investors, it doesn’t matter terribly if Cineworld is sold in pieces or as a whole.","Id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jan/03/2023-uk-economy-financial-gloom-energy-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webTitle":"Will 2023 be a year of muddling through for the UK economy?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jan/03/2023-uk-economy-financial-gloom-energy-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jan/03/2023-uk-economy-financial-gloom-energy-prices","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":747,"webPublicationDate":"2023-01-03T18:03:05Z","hosted":false,"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jan/03/2023-uk-economy-financial-gloom-energy-prices"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Townsville magistrate orders children be released from watch house amid heated youth justice debate","body":"A Townsville magistrate has ordered the release of several children being held on remand in the city’s police watch house, amid growing human rights concerns at the treatment of young people within the Queensland justice system. Guardian Australia has confirmed from multiple legal sources that on Thursday, a children’s court magistrate in Townsville asked that all children being held on remand in the watch house be brought before the court. It is unclear whether every child was subsequently granted bail. The deputy premier, Steven Miles, claimed the action was a “media stunt” that has put people’s safety at risk, and believes at least one appeal has been lodged. The Queensland police service said in a statement to the Guardian on Friday morning that it was “exploring its legal options following the decision of the magistrate in releasing several young people being held in custody in Townsville”. Later on Friday the state’s police minister, Mark Ryan, said police would be appealing “at least some” of the bail decisions to the Queensland supreme court but added he had not seen reasons for the decisions. “If … the exclusive reason bail was granted is because of capacity, I would suggest that is an unlawful reason,” Ryan said. The intervention by the courts comes amid a volatile debate about youth crime in Queensland, including claims by the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, that judges were being too lenient, and a growing number of children being detained in youth prisons and police watch houses for extended periods. Damian Bartholomew, a solicitor for the Youth Advocacy Centre, said members of the judiciary had shown increasing concern about the conditions in watch houses. “Over the last few weeks, many magistrates and judges have said to me the number of young people being held on remand is unacceptable, but that the judiciary have the discretion if a facility is not suitable for children they can grant them bail,” he said. Earlier this week a children’s court magistrate in Mt Isa granted bail to a girl, citing as a concern the likelihood she could end up in a police watch house for an “extended” period. The magistrate, Eoin Mac Giolla Ri, had said in a separate case that housing children in watch houses exposed them to “adult detainees [who] are often drunk, abusive, psychotic or suicidal”. The Queensland police service on Tuesday revealed more than 25 children had spent more than three weeks in watch houses so far this year. In one reported case, a girl with intellectual disabilities was detained for more than 30 days. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup That represents a dramatic increase compared with data from September 2021 to September 2022, which indicates that one child was detained in a watch house for 14.8 days – the longest stint during the period. In recent months, the youth justice debate has placed increased political pressure on the Queensland government, which is preparing to release a new suite of “even tougher” laws. Experts have repeatedly raised concerns as more children are remanded under policies that have sought to deny bail to some children. They say greater rates of incarceration lead to increased rates of reoffending. Meanwhile, youth detention centres have become overcrowded and minors are increasingly being kept in adult police watch houses. Guardian Australia is aware of concerns that intervention from the judiciary may increase pressure on the government to harden its stance. On Friday Miles said: “This media stunt is putting the community of Townsville in danger.” “It should not be happening,” he said. Ryan told reporters he was “frustrated” that children had been bailed. “The appeal process has to run its course but I’m hopeful, I’m hopeful the supreme court will do its job, follow the law, and ensure that community safety is prioritised,” Ryan said. “There are many places where people can be detained … the law is that if someone needs to be detained then they have to be detained. The state of Queensland will find a place to detain them. If they need to be detained in a watch house then that’s where they’ll be detained.” The Queensland police service said after the release of several children on remand they had initiated an “action plan to manage the situation from a community safety perspective”. “Officers will conduct additional patrols, extra bail compliance activities and undertake a range of engagement strategies as part of the action plan,” the QPS said. “The QPS is working with the Department of Youth Justice, which manages the detention of high-risk young people, to minimise the time they spend in police watch houses before being transferred to a detention centre.”","Id":"society/2023/feb/10/queensland-magistrate-orders-townsville-children-released-watch-house-youth-justice","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Townsville magistrate orders children be released from watch house amid heated youth justice debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/10/queensland-magistrate-orders-townsville-children-released-watch-house-youth-justice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/feb/10/queensland-magistrate-orders-townsville-children-released-watch-house-youth-justice","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":781,"webPublicationDate":"2023-02-10T00:56:34Z","hosted":false,"id":"society/2023/feb/10/queensland-magistrate-orders-townsville-children-released-watch-house-youth-justice"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"The Guardian view on Brexit and the economy: time to face facts","body":"There must come a time when the cost of Brexit is recognised by a British government, but that day is not imminent. Even when the economy and migration are two of the most prominent topics of debate, a realistic account of the European dimension to those issues is taboo for Conservatives who still wear their epic policy folly as a badge of honour. Independent observers raise the consequences of Britain’s departure from the EU, as Mark Carney, former Bank of England governor, did on Friday when he observed that it was a factor driving pressure for higher interest rates. Mr Carney went further, pointing out that the UK economy has shrunk relative to similar European states. There is much debate among economists about the best statistical measure to describe that effect, but not much dispute on the underlying fact that Brexit has made Britain poorer, as the remain campaign said it would and the leave campaign denied. The value of sterling dropped as soon as markets received the referendum verdict in June 2016 and has not recovered. The devaluation did not bring the upside in more competitive exports that might have been expected. Trade with Britain’s nearest and richest neighbours has been sabotaged by withdrawal from the EU customs union and single market. Brexit evangelists made improbable promises of compensation for the loss of frictionless borders with Europe via free trade deals around the globe. The US was the most eagerly anticipated partner. That hasn’t happened. There are no talks in Washington to make it happen. The real political imperative keeping Britain out of the single market was not trade but immigration. Ending free movement of labour was an axiomatic requirement for “taking back control” of the borders. Talk of an economic downside to that decision was dismissed by Conservatives as part of insidious pro-Brussels revanche. Now Britain faces labour shortages, which limit business expansion, harm productivity and constrain growth. Choking off legal migration routes has brought no political dividend for the Tories. The party’s right wing is still obsessed with border control, focusing instead on small boat crossings and vilifying refugees for daring to seek asylum in the UK. This too was predicted. Tory Euroscepticism is an unstable coalition of free-trading liberals and cultural nationalists, with the latter dictating the tone of debate and the speed of flight from economic reality. A hunt for scapegoats when the project fails to fulfil its utopian promises is intrinsic to nationalism. That is the grim path down which Mr Sunak’s party is descending, regardless of whether the prime minister himself plans it that way. There is a substantial risk that another cycle of budget austerity will hasten the descent. Cuts to services on top of rising living costs will degrade the public realm and cause anger that the Tories will, if recent history is a guide, address by means of cynical deflection, blaming anyone but themselves. Mr Sunak is trapped. He cannot give an honest appraisal of the nation’s economic predicament, since doing so would mean abandoning vacuous rhetoric around Brexit “opportunities”, recognising instead that Britain’s severance from EU markets is a wound that needs healing. Austerity 1.0 meant business investment was slow to return to pre-crash levels. However, it was frozen after the referendum, before taking a Covid-sized hit. The upshot is that leaving the EU has caused long-term scarring to the country’s productive capacity and competitiveness. Asinine ministerial denial of that reality is a further deterrent to investment. Economic decline stokes political volatility, which makes recovery harder. That vicious cycle will be broken when Britain has a prime minister who is willing to deal in facts about Brexit and set pernicious fictions aside. Rishi Sunak, it seems, is not that man.","Id":"commentisfree/2022/nov/04/the-guardian-view-on-brexit-and-the-economy-time-to-face-facts","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Brexit and the economy: time to face facts | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/04/the-guardian-view-on-brexit-and-the-economy-time-to-face-facts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/04/the-guardian-view-on-brexit-and-the-economy-time-to-face-facts","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion","wordcount":621,"webPublicationDate":"2022-11-04T18:30:28Z","hosted":false,"id":"commentisfree/2022/nov/04/the-guardian-view-on-brexit-and-the-economy-time-to-face-facts"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"SNP leadership debate: Humza Yousaf, Kate Forbes and Ash Regan set out visions for Scotland — as it happened","body":"10.39pm GMT Closing summary Here are the key points from tonight’s SNP leadership debate: Ash Regan said the party had “lost its way”, adding that she will launch a new campaign for independence. She said: “There’s been no progress on independence in the last few years, despite the worst UK government of all time. We used to grow support for independence by governing wisely, and it worked.” Humza Yousaf said he will build on “our government’s radical and progressive agenda” and claims only independence “will unleash our nation’s potential”. He said independence for Scotland is “normal” and “inevitable” and says he will take the campaign to “new heights where the will of the Scottish people can no longer be denied”. Kate Forbes said her priorities include eradicating poverty, tackling the cost of living crisis and reforming the NHS. She said the key to achieving her aims is by building a “world-leading green economy capable of driving growth for generations to come”. On the European Union, Forbes said Scotland must remain aligned with the EU as it smooths the path to re-entry. But Regan called for pragmatism and says it could take “as many as 10 or 15 years” for Scotland to re-join the EU. Yousaf said the SNP should be unequivocal about an independent Scotland’s ambitions to re-join the EU. Regan said the party has spent years seeking what she defines as a “moral mandate” and “begging” Westminster for “what is really an advisory referendum”. She said she would create a “permanent mechanism” for Scots to express when the time is right for a referendum on independence. She also said she would “review” the powersharing agreement with the Greens to ensure it was “working for the people of Scotland”. The Scottish Greens have been seen as hardline on gender reform, while Regan has said she would not challenge the UK government’s move to block the legislation passed by MSPs in December. The trio were asked if they would offer cabinet positions to the other two candidates in the event that they become party leader. Yousaf said that while both his rivals are “talented”, he would not be “presumptuous” enough to imagine which roles he would give to people. Regan said she would “put the best people in the right role”. She did not commit to offering roles to Yousaf and Forbes. Forbes said she “would hope there would be roles for both of them”. Yousaf asked Forbes how she can be trusted to stand up for the Scottish people when her “very first act as leader would be to cave in to the UK government”. She said she “will fight harder than anyone else for Scotland” and says her job is to use devolution to serve the people of Scotland. On the matter of section 35, Forbes says the SNP needs to understand the legal advice and the likelihood of victory through opposing it. That’s it from the SNP leadership debate blog for tonight. Goodnight. Updated at 10.49pm GMT 10.17pm GMT Debate ends A question now on whether the leadership candidates would retain the UK monarchy as part of an independent Scotland. Forbes says: To be honest, I think there are bigger issues facing Scotland when it comes to growing our economy. I’m pretty relaxed, I would see it as part of the Commonwealth. Yousaf reaffirms his republican beliefs, adding: I believe we should be citizens first, not subjects. I agree with Kate it’s not the most immediate issue … we would keep the monarchy for a period of time but I hope an independent Scotland would be a republic in the future. Regan says: I’m also a republican and my preference would be to have an elected head of state. Listen, SNP policy is of course to keep the monarchy and I think that was the right policy at the time. She adds that the Queen’s death has created “new circumstances” on the issue before telling Mackay that if she was first minister, she would attend the King’s coronation – something the other candidates endorse. And with that, the first televised SNP leadership debate is over. Thanks for following along. Updated at 10.19pm GMT 10.12pm GMT The trio are next asked if they would offer cabinet positions to the other two candidates in the event that they become party leader. Yousaf says that while both his rivals are “talented”, he would not be “presumptuous” enough to imaging which roles he would give to people. Regan agrees with Yousaf, adding she would “put the best people in the right role”. She does not commit to offering roles to Yousaf and Forbes. Forbes says she “would hope there would be roles for both of them”. She adds there would be a room for Yousaf but “maybe not health”. 10.07pm GMT A viewer from Glasgow asks the candidates how they would tackle food poverty and the cost of living crisis in Scotland. All three pledge to increase the Scottish Child Payment. Yousaf has previously announced he would look to increase the payment, but says he would push it to £30 per week from £25 in his first budget if elected first minister. Regan says she would see “what more we could do on that”. But Forbes suggests any increase would “have to reflect what inflation is at the time”. Updated at 10.08pm GMT 10.03pm GMT Candidates receive questions from viewers The debate now moves on to questions from viewers. The first is from an SNP member, who asks what immediate steps candidates will take to prioritise Scotland’s “future place in the European Union” in the run up to and post-independence. Forbes says Scotland must remain aligned with the EU as it smooths the path to re-entry. She adds that “we are already working very closely with some of our European partners when it comes to the big issues”. Regan calls for pragmatism and says it could take “as many as 10 or 15 years” for Scotland to re-join the EU. She says “it might make sense for us to look at potentially joining EFTA instead” to prioritise the economy. Yousaf says the SNP should be unequivocal about an independent Scotland’s ambitions to re-join the EU, not EFTA. He says the SNP should have a “permanent presence” in Brussels and should begin laying the groundwork now. Updated at 10.06pm GMT 9.58pm GMT Yousaf says Regan’s first act would be to “dissolve our majority” by rejecting the Greens, the second largest pro-independence party in Scotland. He asks how she can call herself a “unifier”, to which she responds: I am a unifier. I have already united the wider movement around me. If you look at what’s been happening in the arrangement with the Greens, we’ve actually got ourselves into some murky territoty at times. She adds that the SNP needs to review its arrangement with the Greens but says that she is not afraid to govern as a minority government. 9.53pm GMT Yousaf asks Forbes how she can be trusted to stand up for the Scottish people when her “very first act as leader would be to cave in to the UK government”. She says she “will fight harder than anyone else for Scotland” and says her job is to use devolution to serve the people of Scotland. On the matter of section 35, she says the SNP needs to understand the legal advice and the likelihood of victory through opposing it. She tells Yousaf: I believe that courts should be the last option, not the first option. Unlike you, I’m not spoiling for a fight regardless of the legal advice. 9.47pm GMT Now Regan quizzes Forbes on how she plans to move the SNP away from being seen as just a “party of referendum” when “your plan is to keep asking for a referendum”. Forbes says the party needs to persuade people to believe independence is a “route to an end” rather than an “abstract concept”. It needs to be seen as a way of ending poverty and ending injustices and inequalities in Scotland. She says: I’m the only potential leader who can reach out and persuade No voters to vote for independence in a referendum. Regan hits back that Forbes’ plan is to pursue a “plan that has failed”. Forbes says it is time for a “reset” and to campaign for independence at every opportunity. 9.40pm GMT Regan asks Yousaf why he thinks he can find a way to succeed where Nicola Sturgeon failed. Humza Yousaf and Ash Regan go head-to-head on at the SNP leadership debate. Photograph: STV news/Youtube He responds: I’ve got the experience of some of the toughest jobs in government but also I’ve got the vision to inspire people. We’ve got to inspire people to vote for independence, we’ve got to grow that popular support. It’s not about dismissing what Nicola has done, it’s about building upon that legacy. He adds that the UK government would tell Regan “where to go” under her plan if she was first minister. Updated at 9.44pm GMT 9.35pm GMT Candidates question one another The candidates are now being given the opportunity to question one another, with Forbes “cross-examining” Yousaf to get the section under way. She criticises his record in government, saying the trains “never ran on time” when he was transport minister and that “police were strained to breaking point” as justice minister. Kate Forbes at the SNP leadership debate. Photograph: STV news/Youtube After highlighting NHS waiting times in Scotland in his current role as health minister, she asks why he would do a better job as first minister. Yousaf defends his record in government, saying he built new roads and railways, extended protections for domestic abuse victims and delivered the fastest booster programme in the UK. He adds: In Scotland, we are the only nation not have NHS strikes. Not to have a single nurse or single ambulance driver go on strike. That’s not an accident, that’s not good fortune, it’s because I reached out across the divide and got a fair pay deal for the NHS. Updated at 10.00pm GMT 9.29pm GMT Regan says she would “review” the powersharing agreement with the Greens to ensure it was “working for the people of Scotland”. The Scottish Greens have been seen as hardline on gender reform, while Regan has said she would not challenge the UK Government’s move to block the legislation passed by MSPs in December. Asked if she would scrap the deal, the former minister said: I think we need to review whether that arrangement has been working for the people of Scotland. Health secretary Yousaf describes the deal as “vital”, while Forbes says it would be for the Greens to decide if they were happy with her approach if she won the leadership contest. 9.25pm GMT Colin Mackay begins questioning candidates The first question Mackay puts to the three candidates is on how and when they would deliver a second Scottish independence referendum. Regan says the party has spent years seeking what she defines as a “moral mandate” and “begging” Westminster for “what is really an advisory referendum”. She says she would create a “permanent mechanism” for Scots to express when the time is right for a referendum on independence. Forbes responds by saying Scotland will have a referendum once the SNP has persuaded the majority of Scots to vote for independence. She says: That requires a leader … who can also reach out to those who are not yet persuaded. Yousaf says he is the only candidate who will stand up against Westminster’s section 35 veto. He adds: The way we get independence is to build popular support, consistent majority support for independence will mean the political obstacles put up by Westminster, they will be overcome. It is, however, telling that all three candidates have swerved Mackay asking for a date for any potential referendum. Updated at 9.58pm GMT 9.17pm GMT Now is the turn of Kate Forbes to set out her stall in this leadership debate. She says her priorities include eradicating poverty, tackling the cost of living crisis and reforming the NHS. She says the key to achieving her aims is by building a “world-leading green economy capable of driving growth for generations to come”. The SNP finance secretary says “more of the same … is an acceptance of mediocrity”. She continues: It’s time for change, continuity won’t cut it – tonight, I offer a new start for Scotland. More of the same is not a manifesto – it’s an acceptance of mediocrity. We can do better. She adds that it is time “for a new generation to lead, and I am ready and able to lead that new generation”. 9.14pm GMT Leadership candidate Humza Yousaf kicks off by saying he will build on “our government’s radical and progressive agenda” and claims only independence “will unleash our nation’s potential”. He says independence for Scotland is “normal” and “inevitable” and says he will take the campaign to “new heights where the will of the Scottish people can no longer be denied”. He continues: I will build a wellbeing economy with people at the heart, so we can ensure that every child in Scotland, like my girls, has the best start in life, rich with opportunities no matter your background. I am the only candidate who will stand up to Westminster’s power grab and defend our democracy, maintain a pro-independence majority in parliament, and I’m the only candidate who is unequivocally committed to protecting and advancing the rights of all those we serve. As first minister, at every turn, I will serve you the people of Scotland. 9.11pm GMT Debate starts The SNP leadership debate begins with STV’s host Colin Mackay asking the three candidates for a minute-long opening statement each. Ash Regan goes first and immediately tells viewers the party has “lost its way”. She goes on to say she will launch a new campaign for independence. She says: There’s been no progress on independence in the last few years, despite the worst UK government of all time. We used to grow support for independence by governing wisely, and it worked. At every election going forward, we will make it crystal clear that a majority of votes for the SNP will be a democratic mandate for independence. My priority as leader will be to deliver effective government that responds to the needs of the people of Scotland. At the same time, we will build the foundations for independence through a dedicated commission, and launch a new independence campaign through a national convention. A vote for me is a vote for a better Scotland for all of us, through independence. Updated at 9.30pm GMT 8.50pm GMT One of the candidates to become the next leader of the SNP, Humza Yousaf, has been out and about campaigning with student supporters and activists at Glasgow University union earlier today.

Photograph: Duncan Bryceland/REX/Shutterstock Updated at 8.55pm GMT 8.24pm GMT Welcome to the liveblog Good evening and welcome to the first SNP leadership debate blog. Humza Yousaf, Kate Forbes and Ash Regan will all set out their visions for Scotland as they battle it out to succeed the outgoing leader Nicola Sturgeon. We will be bringing you all the latest from the STV debate, which is due to get under way at 9pm and is expected to last just over an hour. The contest has already become an existential fight over the SNP’s direction, policies and ethos. The two leading candidates, Yousaf and Forbes, are setting out competing visions – Yousaf is the continuity candidate and Forbes, 32, the youthful counter-revolutionary. And the contest could end with the socially conservative Forbes, a committed member of the Calvinist Free Church of Scotland, as Scotland’s next first minister. Indeed many of Sturgeon’s major policies are now under threat with deep divisions emerging, as rivals attack key pieces of legislation. The gulf will become clearer when the two frontrunners and the third contender, Ash Regan, face off in Glasgow shortly, in what will be the first of four televised debates.

Sandra Umann, 44, was severely injured last Monday when her bike collided with a cement mixer lorry when she was cycling to work. A specialist rescue vehicle dispatched to the scene was delayed in reaching her because of a blockade by activists from the movement The Last Generation. Her death was announced on Friday. Her twin sister Anja accused the group of insensitivity in their reaction to the matter, saying she was deeply hurt over their “ignorant” response, but added that she did not blame them for the death, amid widespread condemnation of the group’s actions and speculation that Sandra might have survived had the rescue vehicle not been held up. The doctor who attended to Umann at the scene has released her medical notes, which state that the blockade had no influence on whether Umann would have survived or not. Anja Umann gave an interview to Der Spiegel magazine saying she felt the need to express her distress at the way in which the activists, who glued themselves to the road, had appeared to accept that someone might die as a result of their protest, saying they would not change their tactics as a result. She said she and her sister had stood passionately by the ideals for which the protesters were campaigning, and that had added to her distress over the insensitivity of the remarks by people she believed were ostensibly caring. On the evening of the incident, the group released a statement expressing its dismay over the incident, acknowledging that a rescue vehicle had been delayed in reaching Umann because of the protest. Members of the group had glued themselves to a bridge over the A100, a busy western route into the capital. “We are distressed that a cyclist was injured by a lorry today. We ardently hope that her condition did not worsen as a result of the delay,” said the group’s spokesperson, Carla Hinrichs. Aimée van Baalen, a climate protester who was involved, said that if the group had not been forced to such radical action by the government’s lack of action, the incident might not have occurred, and the protests would only end “if the government showed it was prepared to act” on the group’s demands. Tatzio Müller, a member of the group, wrote on Twitter in reaction to the collision: “Shit, but: don’t be intimidated by this. It is a battle for the climate, not a snuggle up, and shit happens.” He later deleted the tweet, apologising for what he called his “stupid and disrespectful formulation in relation to a woman who is in a critically ill condition”. Germany’s Green party robustly condemned the group’s tactics, while stopping short of suggesting they may have directly contributed to the woman’s death. “Anyone who risks the health and life of others loses all legitimacy, as well as harming the climate movement itself,” said Robert Habeck, the vice-chancellor and Germany’s economy minister, who is a senior Green party member. In her interview with Der Spiegel, the victim’s sister issued an appeal to the protesters to rethink their methods. “Maybe there is another way in which to fight for the survival of our planet without risking putting other people’s lives at risk,” she said. She was not interested in attributing guilt, or feeling anger. “Anger will not give me back my sister,” she said. “I will continue to stand behind the protesters but I do question their methods.” Umann paid tribute to her sister, her identical twin, to whom she said she had an inseparable bond. The two shared a joint passion for environmental issues and had founded a vegan fashion label together, while her sister refused to own a car. “My sister was my world, just as I was her world. When I last saw her on Monday it was to see her out of the door with her bike to go to work ... I said to her: ‘Please drive carefully; I look forward to seeing you later.’ She cycled off and 10 minutes later the accident happened, not far from where we live.” Umann did not find out about the collision until that evening, after her sister failed to return home. When doctors finally allowed Umann to see her sister, she said, “it was hardly possible to touch her because everything was so damaged. She was in an induced coma and being artificially respirated. There was one small place on her forehead which I was able to touch and to stroke her hair.” She said doctors told her on Wednesday to prepare for her sister’s death. Sandra died the following day. Umann said that to have lost her sister was “like living a nightmare. My sister and I are identical twins … we were never separated in our entire 44 years, and did everything together.” Police have launched proceedings against two activists, a 63-year-old and a 59-year-old, accusing them of failure to render assistance in an emergency and preventing a person from receiving assistance. A white “ghost bike”, of the kind regularly erected after cyclists’ deaths in road accidents, has been placed at the site of Umann’s collision as a memorial.","Id":"world/2022/nov/10/death-of-cyclist-in-berlin-provokes-debate-over-road-protests","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Death of cyclist in Berlin provokes debate over road protests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/10/death-of-cyclist-in-berlin-provokes-debate-over-road-protests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/10/death-of-cyclist-in-berlin-provokes-debate-over-road-protests","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":879,"webPublicationDate":"2022-11-10T17:35:10Z","hosted":false,"id":"world/2022/nov/10/death-of-cyclist-in-berlin-provokes-debate-over-road-protests"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Georgia governor debate: Kemp silent on question over harsher abortion restrictions","body":"In the final televised debate with Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams before their November election, Georgia’s governor, Brian Kemp, refused to say whether he would support harsher abortion restrictions if re-elected to a second term and if fellow Republicans dominating the state legislature sent them to his desk. Related: Utah: can an ex-CIA independent oust an incumbent Republican senator? At WSB-TV’s Channel 2 Action debate Sunday, Kemp, a Republican, said it was not his “desire to go move the needle any further” on abortion restrictions in Georgia, adding that he would look into additional restrictions passed by state lawmakers “when the time comes”. Kemp at a previous debate had said he “would not” support new abortion limits. The Sunday night debate heightened an already contentious rematch over the governorship. Kemp narrowly defeated Abrams in 2018, and polling shows he holds a lead over Abrams more than a week before the election. Abrams sought to draw a stark contrast with Kemp over the issues of guns, the economy, crime and voting restrictions. “Under Brian Kemp’s four years as governor, crime has gone up, hospitals have closed and communities are in turmoil,” Abrams said in her closing arguments. The state already effectively bars most abortions after Kemp signed an abortion law in 2019 that prohibits the procedure six weeks into a pregnancy. The law went into effect after the US supreme court in June overturned abortion rights nationwide, established nearly 50 years earlier by Roe v Wade. A trial has recently begun over whether the state’s imposition of the 2019 law is constitutional. “Let’s be clear, he did not say he wouldn’t,” Abrams said in response to Kemp’s remarks Sunday. She tied Kemp to Georgia US Senate candidate Herschel Walker, who is accused by two women of pressuring them to have an abortion, even though Walker has stated he is staunchly opposed to the termination of pregnancies. Walker denies the allegations. “He refuses to protect us. He refuses to defend us,” Abrams said of Kemp. “And yet he defended Herschel Walker, saying that he didn’t want to be involved in the personal life of his running mate.” By contrast, Abrams supported legal abortions before the point of “viability”, noting that the decision should be made “between a doctor and a woman – as a medical choice.” Kemp contended that Abrams’ stance shifted on whether she would support new restrictions brought to her. “It is willful ignorance or misleading lies that change what I’ve said,” Abrams said. “But what I’ve also always said is that there should not be arbitrary timelines set by men who do not understand biology.” • This article was amended on 31 October 2022. An earlier version said Abrams supported abortion after the point of viability.","Id":"us-news/2022/oct/31/georgia-abrams-kemp-debate-governor-abortion","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"Georgia governor debate: Kemp silent on question over harsher abortion restrictions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/31/georgia-abrams-kemp-debate-governor-abortion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/oct/31/georgia-abrams-kemp-debate-governor-abortion","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":444,"webPublicationDate":"2022-10-31T14:10:11Z","hosted":false,"id":"us-news/2022/oct/31/georgia-abrams-kemp-debate-governor-abortion"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Morning Mail: dementia our new top health problem, super debate heats up, JK Rowling’s book fears","body":"Morning everyone.

The UK economy is expected to shrink this year and will be at the back of the leading G7 countries during 2023, the International Monetary Fund has warned. The IMF has lifted its forecast for the UK’s economy this year – it is now expected to shrink by 0.3%, not the 0.6% fall in GDP previously expected. That would leave the UK lagging behind other advanced economies this year. Interactive IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters in Washington DC that UK growth this year has been stronger than than expected, but that the UK was vulnerable to a trade shock from high imported energy costs. The tight labour market has also led to higher interest rates to fight inflation, Gourinchas told reporters in Washington DC. Related: UK economy expected to shrink this year, says IMF The IMF also warned that the global economy could suffer a “hard landing” if persistently troublesome inflation forces interest rates to stay higher for longer. But it has also predicted interest rates will fall back towards pre-pandemic levels, due to weak productivity and aging populations.

The IMF forecasts that world growth will drop to 2.8% this year, from 3.4% in 2022, before rising to 3% in 2024. McFee says the new projections underestimate the impact of tighter financial conditions on advanced economies, saying: The IMF’s forecast still looks too optimistic over the next 2 years in our view. The impact of bank funding turmoil looks to have been offset in their forecasts by the positive developments in European energy markets, solid economic momentum and China’s earlier than expected reopening, to leave the IMF’s global GDP projection broadly unchanged. But we think their forecasts underestimate the impact that tightening in financial conditions will have on advanced economies in second half of this year and next. Our latest global forecast – to be published tomorrow – is more downbeat this year and next. We expect growth in PPP terms of 2.3% this year and 2.8% next, which is weak by historical standards. This equates to 1.9% and 2.2% respectively on a constant exchange rates basis – our preferred measure of global activity. A key difference in our thinking seems to be that we expect more of an economic impact from tighter financial conditions in advanced economies than the IMF. Consequently, our 2024 forecasts for GDP growth in the US, Canada and the eurozone are more cautious. With the fallout from bank funding turmoil still to be fully realised, we maintain the view that there are substantial downside risks to our forecast. The IMF appears to agree, assigning a 25% probability that global growth will fall below 2% in 2023. Ryan Myerberg, portfolio manager and co-head of global taxable fixed income at Brown Advisory, agrees that higher borrowing costs are hitting the world economy, and worrying investors: “We agree with the IMF when it says that the recalibration of growth is lower as tighter monetary policy continues to bite. We have long been pounding the table over the impact that the last 12 plus months of hikes will have on interest rate-sensitive parts of the global economy and its role in creating an environment of nervous investors, which means every wobble and crack that appears will be magnified. This is especially true as liquidity conditions in all asset classes continues to get worse.” 4.19pm BST City of London Police has launched an investigation into alleged sexual misconduct at the Confederation of British Business (CBI) in the wake of the Guardian’s coverage of allegations at the business organisation, my colleague Ben Quinn reports. The force told the Guardian that it had approached the CBI following media reports, and that its investigation was at a very early stage. The Guardian reported last week that more than a dozen women claimed to have been victims of various forms of sexual misconduct by senior figures at the CBI, including one who alleges she was raped at a staff party on a boat on the River Thames. The, which is responsible for law enforcement within the City of London, including the Middle and Inner Temples, released a statement after it was approached by the Guardian on Tuesday. A spokesperson said: “The City of London Police takes all acts of sexual misconduct and violence against women and girls extremely seriously.” “We approached the CBI following media reports and our investigations are at a very early stage. It would not be appropriate to comment any further at this time.” 3.49pm BST Megan Greene to join Bank of England's monetary policy committee Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has appointed Megan Greene, the global chief economist at Kroll, to the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee.

Gourinchas says the “brief instability” in the gilts market (after the mini-budget) was an example of rapid rises in interest rates creating pockets of vulnerability in the financial sector. It prompted the Bank of England to pledge to buy up to £65bn of gilts to calm the markets, and avoid pension funds blowing up.

Gourinchas explained that there could be situations where near-term stability risks could take precedence, such as a crisis that moves beyond the severe adverse “risk-off” scenario in the IMF’s World Economic Outlook. He explained: “It doesn’t mean that you would abandon any nominal anchor but it means that in the near term, you would have to put financial stability first. 2.59pm BST Abrdn: UK facing recession-like conditions The IMF’s forecasts once again make for “grim reading” in their assessment of the UK economy and the global economy more generally, warns Luke Bartholomew, senior economist at asset management firm abrdn. Bartholomew thinks the IMF is on the right lines with its assessment of the UK, but too optimistic about the US economy: “Precise growth forecasts are notoriously difficult to get right, and no doubt the IMF will be wrong in the specifics of their numerical forecasts. But we agree with the broad message of the forecasts that the UK economy is likely to endure recession-like conditions for much of this year. “We don’t think the IMF is pessimistic enough on US growth as we expect ongoing credit condition tightening to tip the US economy into recession later this year, with large spillovers to the rest of the world. Bartholomew adds that the most interesting aspect of the IMF’s analysis could be its prediction that interest rates will fall back towards their pre-pandemic levels (as covered earlier this morning): “Over the long run, interest rates are pinned down by slow moving forces like demographics and inequality, and the IMF sees little reason to think these have been fundamentally changed since the pandemic. If the IMF is right about this, and we are right about a recession, the debate will move to how much central banks are likely to cut interest rates in the coming years. Investors may find this period of high interest rates was simply a brief interruption of the low-rate world they have been dealing with since the global financial crisis.” 2.55pm BST Britain’s economy is being held back by the ‘botched’ Brexit deal agreed by the government says Layla Moran, Lib Dem MP and member of the UK Trade and Business Commission. Commenting on today’s IMF forecasts, showing the UK will shrink by 0.3% this year, Moran explains: “This isn’t rocket science. The UK is the only developed economy with the added pressures of Brexit where businesses face extra costs, mountains of new red tape and amplified labour shortages. “Our economy will continue to underperform until this incompetent Conservative government owns up to and fixes the issues caused by their botched Brexit deal.” 2.34pm BST Rachel Reeves MP, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor, warns the IMF’s new economic outlook highlights that the UK is lagging behind. Reeves says: IMF projections that Britain will have a smaller economy by the end of the year, and the poorest growth in the G7 over this year and next, shows just how far we continue to lag behind on the global stage. This matters not just because 13 years of low growth under the Tories are weakening our economy, but because it’s why families are worse off, facing a Tory mortgage penalty and seeing living standards falling at their fastest rate since records began. The government should be easing the cost of living crisis now, by backing Labour’s plan to freeze council tax this year, funded by a proper windfall tax on oil and gas giants. And they must get our economy growing - matching the ambition and plan behind Labour’s mission to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7. Updated at 3.02pm BST 2.28pm BST Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has responded to today’s IMF forecasts: Thanks to the steps we have taken, the OBR says the UK will avoid recession, and our IMF growth forecasts have been upgraded by more than any other G7 country. The IMF now say we are on the right track for economic growth. By sticking to the plan we will more than halve inflation this year, easing the pressure on everyone. This chart from the IMF’s World Economic Outlook shows the latest forecasts, and the changes compared with January.

Stressing the growing risks of a hard landing for developed countries, the Washington-based body singled out the UK and the euro area as being particularly affected by rising energy costs and higher inflation, my colleague Larry Elliott reports from Washington DC. The IMF slightly revised up its estimate of UK growth this year from the -0.6% pencilled in three months ago but still expected the economy to contract by 0.3%. Related: UK economy expected to shrink this year, says IMF And here’s Larry’s analysis on the Fund’s latest assessment of the world economy: Related: IMF suggests fight against inflation could risk financial stability Updated at 2.08pm BST 2.06pm BST IMF: Hard landing is 'much larger risk' The IMF warns today that the global economy has reached another “highly uncertain moment” in its rocky recovery. The Fund’s World Economic Outlook begins by pointing out that inflation reached multidecade highs last year in many economies, due to pent-up demand, supply chain problems and commodity price spikes following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That led central banks to tighten aggressively by raising interest rates. The Fund warns that “the fog around the world economic outlook has thickened”, partly due to the recent increase in financial market volatility due to jitters in the banking sector. It fears that a ‘hard landing’ (where central bankers drive economies into recession) is a larger risk. The WEO cautions that: Uncertainty is high, and the balance of risks has shifted firmly to the downside so long as the financial sector remains unsettled. The major forces that affected the world in 2022 — central banks’ tight monetary stances to allay inflation, limited fiscal buffers to absorb shocks amid historically high debt levels, commodity price spikes and geoeconomic fragmentation with Russia’s war in Ukraine, and China’s economic reopening — seem likely to continue into 2023. But these forces are now overlaid by and interacting with new financial stability concerns. A hard landing— particularly for advanced economies—has become a much larger risk. Policymakers may face difficult trade-offs to bring sticky inflation down and maintain growth while also preserving financial stability. 2.00pm BST UK on track to be worst-performing G7 economy this year, says IMF Newsflash: the UK is on track to be the worst-performing advanced economy this year. The International Monetary Fund has forecast UK GDP will shrink by 0.3% in 2023, worse than other G7 countries. That’s an improvement on the Fund’s previous forecasts, though, when the UK was expected to contract by 0.6% this year. The IMF’s World Economic Outlook, just released, predicts that the UK will then grow by 1% in 2024. The US, in contrast, is forecast to grow by 1.6% this year, and 1.1% in 2024. The eurozone is expected to expand by 0.8% in 2023, and accelerate to 1.4% growth next year. Germany, though, is forecast to shrink slightly, by 0.1%, in 2023, and grow by 1.1% in 2024. France (+0.7%, then 1.3%), Italy (+0.7% then 0.8%) and Spain (+1.5% then 2%) are all seen growing this year and next. As are Canada (+1.5% in both years), and Japan (+1.3% in 2023, then 1% in 2024). Even Russia is expected to grow this year (by 0.7%) and in 2024 (by 1.3%), after a 2.1% contraction last year. Interactive Updated at 3.19pm BST 1.17pm BST Labour’s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said developments at the CBI were “incredibly concerning”, PA Media reports. Responding to the sacking of Tony Danker, the head of the business organisation, Labour’s shadow chancellor told broadcasters during a visit to Brighton: Obviously what is happening at the CBI is incredibly concerning and it’s important that these reviews are able to take their course. Labour, like the government, have cut our ties and are not currently doing any engagement with the CBI whilst these inquiries are ongoing. Updated at 3.02pm BST 1.15pm BST Meetings between ministers and the Confederation of British Industry remain paused while the organisation continues its investigation into misconduct allegations, Downing Street has said. The dismissal of CBI chief Tony Danker will not end the move by ministers and officials to cancel engagements with the organisation, a No 10 spokesman told reporters. The spokesman said: His departure is a matter for the CBI, but we continue to expect any allegations to be taken seriously and for appropriate action to be taken in response. While the CBI continues to investigate we will pause engagement by ministers and senior officials with the CBI.

The CBI HR director, Lauren Adams, will fill the role on an interim basis while a “wide-ranging external recruitment process” is conducted. The CBI’s board added this morning that: The current independent and confidential channel outside the CBI for people to come forward with concerns and complaints about workplace conduct will be made permanent. We also recognise the enormous strain this experience has placed on all our people and will continue to offer support to anyone who needs it.

Gardiner explains: What CBI should be doing is reviewing its current arrangements, regular training of managers on how to be good recipients of bad news, and checking that staff are aware of and confident in the processes. Whistleblowers provide employers a gift of information – an early warning that something is wrong. Failure to listen can lead to harm to individuals, organisations and the public interest. 11.24am BST Confidence among small US firms has dipped, as the inflation continues to worry business owners.

The deal values FGS Global at around $1.4bn, as had been rumoured last week. Existing investor Golden Gate Capital is selling its entire stake to KKR. The group is also buying shares from senior employees at the firm and its largest investors, including London-based advertising giant WPP (which will still hold a majority stake), Reuters reports. FGS was formed in 2020 through the merger of London’s Finsbury, Germany’s Hering Schuppener, and the Glover Park Group, before then buying US-based Sard Verbinnen in October 2021 (updated). Finsbury was founded in 1994 by Roland Rudd, the brother of the former UK home secretary Amber Rudd and a leading campaigner against Brexit. Rudd is now one of three co-chairs of FGS Global, alongside Carter Eskew and George Sard.

He tells us: IMF predictions that central banks will cut interest rates soon will most likely materialize sooner than the Fund expects. Why? The very latest movements in the Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) which predicts inflation movements quite well (as I explain here) indicate that inflation pressures are receding extremely fast. In fact, supply chain pressures have collapsed! This suggests to me that Central Banks will be “forced” to cut interest rates quite soon.

The CBI hired a law firm to investigate him after the Guardian approached the business group about a formal complaint that was made in January, as well a number of alleged informal reports of concerns over his behaviour. The business lobby group said it wanted to make clear that Danker was not the subject of other complaints recently reported by the Guardian.

She says the allegations of misconduct at the business lobbying group are another reminder that wherever there is money there is power… and that “where there is power, abuse – in some form – is frequently still rife”. Cox explains: Despite ostensible efforts by some of Britain’s biggest companies to create equal opportunities and appropriate representation for all genders and races within the workplace, businesses remain stubbornly skewed. They’re predominantly led by white men and blighted by the pay gap and the authority gap, in which women find it more difficult to be taken seriously at work. As a function of these chasms, troubling power dynamics allow for cultures of sexism and, in some cases, toxic masculinity to prevail.

Bitcoin has climbed to above $30,000 for the first time since last June, which is almost double the lows hit hit last autumn. However, it’s still over 50% below the record highs set in November 2021, before sliding through 2022. The price of bitcoin over the last five years Photograph: Refinitiv Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, predicts the rally will continue, saying: Bitcoin’s crypto winter is finally gone today, as the price has broken above a critical barrier level of $30,000. Bitcoin has already recovered about half of its losses from its all-time high, and it is up more than 100% from the crypto winter lows. The present price pattern is expected to generate a lot of attention, as well as FOMO among investors, many of whom have already missed out as the price has regained its significant losses. Yet, we do feel that the moment has come to be a strategic investor in cryptocurrency, since we believe that the path of least resistance for Bitcoin is skewed to the upside and that the present surge is simply the beginning of what is to come. Bill Blain, market strategist at Shard Capital, says he doesn’t have faith in crypto, citing its “zero legal utility”, regulatory vulnerability, and instability. But, Blain writes, other traders who bought into bitcoin at the start of the year are sitting on profits, having concluded it was cheap at the start of the year.

Nice. Another sailing mate then told me he follows the candle charts, and reckons there are some seriously bullish signals revealed by “Bollinger Band” analysis of the Bitcoin price action – it’s going to break higher he confidently told me.

China’s consumer price index rose by just 0.7% in the year to March, the slowest pace since September 2021, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said. That’s a slowdown on February’s 1% increase, and weaker than the 1.0% rise forecast by economists. #CEIndex #China's consumer price index (#CPI), a main gauge of inflation, rose 0.7 percent year on year in March.

The producer price index (PPI) fell 2.5% year-on-year, the fastest pace since June 2020, accelerating from the 1.4% drop seen in February. Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, says the data shows China’s recovery is losing steam after pandemic restrictions were lifted. Chinese consumer inflation read weaker than expected in March, while producer price inflation contracted steadily amid growing signs that a post-COVID economic recovery in the country, especially in the manufacturing sector, was losing steam. With PPI falling, simply connect the dots as the data speaks loud and clear that consumer spending is still struggling to pick up. 8.08am BST Why the IMF might be wrong Not all economists agree with the IMF’s view that the natural rate of interest will fall back to pre-Covid levels, once the inflation shock has abated. Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has predicted that rates will be substantially higher on average in the years ahead. Last month, Summers suggested the real neutral rate might be in the range of 1.5% to 2% going forward. He believes that increased government borrowing, partly to fund defense spending, will keep borrowing costs higher. Indeed, the IMF’s team of economists agrees there are a few reasons why its assumptions could be wrong. For example, they say, government support may be difficult to withdraw, increasing public debt. Second, the costs of the green energy transition could also push up deficits. Thirdly, “deglobalization forces could intensify”, leading to both trade and financial fragmentation and pushing up the cost of borrowing. 7.51am BST World Bank chief raises 2023 global growth outlook slightly, The head of the World Bank has revealed that it has lifted its growth forecast for this year. Reuters has the details: World Bank Group President David Malpass said on Monday that the lender has revised its 2023 global growth outlook slightly upward to 2% from a January forecast of 1.7% but the slowdown from stronger 2022 growth will increase debt distress for developing countries. Malpass told a media briefing that the upward revision was due to an improved outlook for China’s recovery from COVID-19 lockdowns, with growth now pegged at 5.1% this year compared to 4.3% in the bank’s January Global Economic Prospects report. Advanced economies, including the U.S. and in Europe, are also doing a bit better than the World Bank anticipated in January, Malpass said as the World Bank’s and International Monetary Fund’s Spring Meetings week kicked off. While this is a growth upgrade for this year, it’s still weaker than the 3% growth which the World Bank expected nine months ago. Malpass also warned that the recent turmoil in the banking sector and higher oil prices could weigh on growth prospects in the second half of this year. \uD83C\uDF0E World Bank chief raises 2023 global growth outlook slightly, eyes debt progress - Reutershttps://t.co/R8YUE1kbPU — Christophe Barraud\uD83D\uDEE2\uD83D\uDC33 (@C_Barraud) April 10, 2023 7.48am BST Introduction: interest rates likely to return towards pre-Covid levels, says IMF Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Interest rates are set to fall back to levels seen before the outbreak of Covid-19 once inflation has been tamed. That’s the message from the International Monetary Fund this morning, as top economists and central bankers head to Washington DC for its Spring meeting. A team of IMF economists have examined the ‘natural rate of interest’ – the interest rate which keeps inflation on target while neither stimulating nor hampering economic growth. Their conclusion: the recent increases in real interest rates are “likely to be temporary”, due to factors such as sluggish productivity growth and aging populations. They predict the natural rates in advanced economies “will likely remain low”, while those in emerging markets are likely to drop towards those levels. That would mean interest rates would fall towards the lows seen in the pandemic. In the UK, interest rates were cut from 0.75% to just 0.1% in early 2020 (they’re currently 4.25%). The IMF say: When inflation is brought back under control, advanced economies’ central banks are likely to ease monetary policy and bring real interest rates back towards pre-pandemic levels. How close to those levels will depend on whether alternative scenarios involving persistently higher government debt and deficits, or financial fragmentation materialize. In large emerging markets, conservative projections of future demographic and productivity trends suggest a gradual convergence towards advanced economies’ real interest rates. The recent uptick in interest rates is likely to be temporary. Our latest World Economic Outlook blog explains why. https://t.co/6wzvAgnamL #WEO pic.twitter.com/Oxup4Q72cW — IMF (@IMFNews) April 10, 2023 The natural rate is an important anchor for monetary policy, as central bankers try to set interest rates to keep rising prices in check without driving people out of work. So if the IMF are right, it’s a boost for borrowers such as households struggling with mortgage payments. But, it would suggest central bankers could be left with less firepower to fight the next downturn, if major economies are saddled with chronically weak productivity and smaller workforces due to demographic changes. The work is part of the IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook, which will be released later today. The Fund will also release a new Global Financial Stability Report as part of its annual spring meetings with the World Bank in Washington. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, warned last week that the global economy is heading for the weakest period of growth since 1990, as the surge in interest rates to fight inflation hits the global economy. As the #IMFMeetings kick off, it’s a valuable opportunity for the global community to come together to discuss not only urgent economic issues, but a chance to discuss the way forward to promote economic prosperity for all. https://t.co/zAIA9ZLUQZ pic.twitter.com/PLEsecNX4t — IMF (@IMFNews) April 11, 2023 The agenda 9am BST: China’s new yuan loans for March 10am BST: Eurozone retail sales for February 11am BST: NFIB index of small US business optimism 2pm BST: IMF publishes latest World Economic Outlook 3.30pm BST: IMF publishes latest Global Financial Stability Report Updated at 7.55am BST","Id":"business/live/2023/apr/11/interest-rates-pre-covid-levels-imf-world-economy-stock-markets-bitcoin-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webTitle":"UK on track to be worst-performing G7 economy this year, says IMF – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/apr/11/interest-rates-pre-covid-levels-imf-world-economy-stock-markets-bitcoin-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2023/apr/11/interest-rates-pre-covid-levels-imf-world-economy-stock-markets-bitcoin-business-live","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":6682,"webPublicationDate":"2023-04-11T15:42:08Z","hosted":false,"id":"business/live/2023/apr/11/interest-rates-pre-covid-levels-imf-world-economy-stock-markets-bitcoin-business-live"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"The NSW premier was asked to name his seven kids in an election debate – that’s how flat this campaign has been","body":"That one of the most intriguing points of Wednesday’s debate between the New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, and opposition leader, Chris Minns, came via the bizarre theatre of both men being asked to name their own children gives you some idea of where things are at 10 days out from the election. Before it began, Nine dubbed its “great debate” as the hour which would decide the election. In a campaign which has rarely soared to great heights, it’s fitting that hour was midday on a Wednesday. Related: A late heatwave will test NSW’s strained electricity grid – and Perrottet can’t afford any hint of disruption Despite polling and popular opinion suggesting that the 25 March vote will be one of the closest in recent NSW history there has been a muted tone throughout the entire campaign. Labor has, for months, hewed to a narrow message focused on cost-of-living relief and government services without offering any truly transformative policies on either. The Coalition, weighed down by the baggage of 12 years in government, has struggled to craft a coherent argument for why it deserves four more. Both of those faults were on display on Wednesday. Labor has sought to make its lack of ambition a net positive by arguing the state’s surging debt means it’s irresponsible to embark on a spending spree. A fair argument. Minns has also repeatedly promised to be “upfront” with voters about the economic headwinds facing the state. Again, good news. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The problem though, which came through on Wednesday, is that approach can make Minns appear pessimistic without any clear notion of how to improve things. One of Labor’s signature policies in this election is to remove the government’s cap on public sector wages, but on Wednesday Minns refused to guarantee that teachers and nurses would get a pay rise if he becomes premier. “Well, we need to do that around the table,” he said after repeated questioning from the panel. “And that needs to be a negotiation that can only happen in government.” Which, while accepting that the Coalition has sought (largely unsuccessfully) to use the abolition of the cap as evidence it is a better economic manager, seems an oddly cautious note to take when higher wages are, presumably, the point. Related: NSW Labor criticised for directing preferences to Shooters party in key seats Minns also opened himself to attack by simultaneously criticising the Coalition for a series of infrastructure projects including new Metro lines in south-west and western Sydney which Labor says don’t stack up financially, while also accusing it of allowing too much development in western Sydney without adequate infrastructure. “This is the lack of vision that comes with a Labor government,” Perrottet countered. “You’ve got to plan for the future and that’s exactly what we’re doing with the Metro trains. I remember being a young kid and Labor promised the north-west Metro [and] never delivered it because they’re so focused on the short term.” But the premier often seemed at sea during the debate. While Minns always appears relaxed to a fault (he told Perrottet to “calm down” during the debate) the premier is an animated speaker who enjoys going off-the-cuff during press conferences. But he seemed rattled by the occasion at times, struggling to counter the opposition leader’s attacks on the government’s record on privatisation and debt. Which really goes to the heart of the Coalition’s problem in this election. For 12 years it has told voters in NSW that “asset recycling” – privatisation by another word – was the key to its impressive record on new infrastructure. But now, thanks to Labor’s canny campaigning and a broader dissatisfaction in the electorate, thanks to issues such as increasingly expensive privatised toll roads, it has been forced to disavow that record. Perrottet was again forced to rule out the sale of Sydney Water despite documents on Tuesday showing the government at least contemplated the sale, while also insisting he could continue to fund billions of dollars worth of new infrastructure promises. He was also forced to clarify who would be eligible for the government’s signature ‘Kids Future Fund’ after the treasurer, Matt Kean, struggled to answer questions about the policy earlier in the day. In the end, perhaps the most telling part of the debate came during a quick-fire round of one word answers. Both men answered “no” when asked if the former premier Gladys Berejiklian had been treated unfairly by the Independent Commission Against Corruption, and, in a statement which will take on a new relevance after next Saturday when the prospect of a minority government will loom large, said that they would not do deals with the crossbench. Then the moderator, Peter Overton, challenged Perrottet and Minns to name their children in order of age (the premier has seven, Minns three). They did, correctly, a welcome moment of clarity in a campaign otherwise shrouded in a fug of meh.","Id":"australia-news/2023/mar/15/the-nsw-premier-was-asked-to-name-his-seven-kids-in-an-election-debate-thats-how-flat-this-campaign-has-been","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"The NSW premier was asked to name his seven kids in an election debate – that’s how flat this campaign has been","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/15/the-nsw-premier-was-asked-to-name-his-seven-kids-in-an-election-debate-thats-how-flat-this-campaign-has-been","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/15/the-nsw-premier-was-asked-to-name-his-seven-kids-in-an-election-debate-thats-how-flat-this-campaign-has-been","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":803,"webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T06:30:32Z","hosted":false,"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/15/the-nsw-premier-was-asked-to-name-his-seven-kids-in-an-election-debate-thats-how-flat-this-campaign-has-been"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Rishi Sunak ‘aggressive’ in Tory leadership debate, say Truss supporters","body":"A Treasury minister has said his former boss Rishi Sunak took an “extremely aggressive” approach in the Conservative leadership debate with Liz Truss, after allies of Truss accused him of “mansplaining”. Simon Clarke, the chief secretary to the Treasury who is backing Truss, said Sunak was “certainly extremely aggressive” in parts of the debate. “It was a pretty intense approach to the early parts of the debate last night,” he told LBC. But the former cabinet minister David Davis defended Sunak, saying he gave sound warnings on the economy. The two Conservative leadership hopefuls traded blows at the BBC debate over tax cuts, China and inflation, with the former chancellor Sunak accusing the foreign secretary of seeking “a short-term sugar rush” by cutting national insurance. Truss accused her former cabinet colleague of raising taxes to their highest level for 70 years. The exchanges at the BBC debate followed a weekend of deeply personal attacks, with Sunak criticised over his wealth and wardrobe while Truss faced claims she was economically illiterate and was reminded that she was formerly a remainer. Davis repeated warnings made by Sunak that Truss’s economic policies could push up mortgage rates. “I think you’ve got to win the arguments, and the arguments that matter, which is why the 7% matters,” he told Sky News, referring to the argument made by Truss’s economic adviser Patrick Minford for a 7% base interest rate, which could push up mortgage rates. “That’s why that matters. It’s very important. The Tory party, generally speaking, is a bit older than average. It’s a little bit more middle class, but not so much these days, but a little bit more middle class. It will care about things like their offspring having to face these sorts of interest rates in the future, so that matters.” He defended Sunak’s style of interrupting Truss. “Sometimes it’s important to intervene in debates,” he said. “When we’re in the Commons we have these comparatively fierce exchanges lots of times, all the time.” Davis added: “This is a debate to find the prime minister of this country. Facing a time when the decisions are going to be really tough … We need the person who a) knows what he stands for, b) is courageous enough to take the difficult decisions and c) is determined enough to do it. And that’s Rishi Sunak.” Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am Clarke told Times Radio that Truss believed that low taxes would be the route to growth. “Crucially we have to go to the heart of this question. Do you believe the tax cuts grow the size of the economy? Do you believe that they are in themselves something which can create more fiscal space by growing the underlying economy?” he told Times Radio. “The answer to that as a Conservative must be yes. And that is the point that Liz is making. We’ve got to break with the orthodoxies which have frankly held us back for too long. And we got to get back to the principles which drove the Thatcher government, which is a lower tax economy is a good in its own right, and that is what Liz is pressing.”","Id":"politics/2022/jul/26/rishi-sunak-tory-leadership-debate-aggressive-style-mansplaining","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Rishi Sunak ‘aggressive’ in Tory leadership debate, say Truss supporters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/26/rishi-sunak-tory-leadership-debate-aggressive-style-mansplaining","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/26/rishi-sunak-tory-leadership-debate-aggressive-style-mansplaining","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":524,"webPublicationDate":"2022-07-26T07:54:31Z","hosted":false,"id":"politics/2022/jul/26/rishi-sunak-tory-leadership-debate-aggressive-style-mansplaining"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Tory leadership race: five key takeaways from second debate","body":"It was only an hour long, but the ITV Conservative leadership debate packed in more than its fair share of controversy – not to mention acrimony. Here are five key takeaways: Everyone hates Rishi Everyone now knows the final runoff of two candidates to be put before the Conservative party membership will come down to Sunak v AN Other. But it was notable that debate centred on him, and when the candidates were given a chance to ask a question of another hopeful, three of the other four picked the former chancellor. The exchanges on taxation and spending were particularly robust, with the others repeatedly attacking Sunak for his tax rises, while he laid into Liz Truss and Penny Mordaunt for “fantasy economics of unfunded promises”. At one point he seemed to argue Mordaunt was more leftwing on public borrowing than Jeremy Corbyn, which might come as news to the former Labour leader. Everyone hates Boris even more Again, that is an exaggeration, but only just. Perhaps the most dramatic single moment of the hour came when host Julie Etchingham asked the five to raise a hand if they were willing to have Boris Johnson in their cabinet. Not a hand went up. This is, admittedly, not a prime period for being a Johnsonist, but Sunak, and especially Truss, have previously sung the caretaker PM’s praises. As one observer put it on Twitter, “Et tu, Liz?” The cost of living crisis is not yet being taken seriously The fact that the candidates have first to parade their wares to Tory MPs before getting to show some policy ankle for party members does skew things, but it was notable how general and vague many of the answers were to the first question, about how to tackle the cost of living and energy crisis. Related: How well did the Tory leadership candidates do in the second TV debate? | Andrew Sparrow’s verdict Almost all the candidates used this as a chance to tout their offerings in areas like tax cuts, reducing fuel duty or long-term ideas for the economy, which tend to be either weighted towards the better off, are too slow to work, or both. One of these five will be inside No 10 in early September. They will need some better ideas by then. Heatwave? What heatwave? This is not new in policy terms, but a day before what could well be the first 40C-plus day ever recorded in the UK – part of a wider pattern of extreme weather events that scientists do not doubt is caused by human activity – it was glaring that only one candidate, Sunak, unequivocally backed the net zero by 2050 target for emissions. Two – Kemi Badenoch and Tom Tugendhat – were less supportive, especially the former, while both Truss and Mordaunt talked about the target in terms of making sure it did not harm the economy. There is very little sign of the sort of ambition almost every climate scientist believes is needed to transform the economy and stem the crisis. Mudslinging can rebound The overall tone of the debate was not especially edifying, and it was notable that arguably the most uncomfortable moment for both Truss and Badenoch came when Etchingham challenged them over negative tactics. Badenoch stood by her assertion that Mordaunt is either a liar or a fool in their slightly niche disagreement over self-identification for gender, but looked unsettled. As Truss sought to decry dirty tricks, Etchingham helpfully reminded the foreign secretary that her allies are regular sources for hostile briefings about the others. The reputation of rats in sacks rose by comparison.","Id":"politics/2022/jul/17/tory-leadership-race-five-key-takeaways-from-second-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Tory leadership race: five key takeaways from second debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/17/tory-leadership-race-five-key-takeaways-from-second-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/17/tory-leadership-race-five-key-takeaways-from-second-debate","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":582,"webPublicationDate":"2022-07-17T19:57:27Z","hosted":false,"id":"politics/2022/jul/17/tory-leadership-race-five-key-takeaways-from-second-debate"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Australia might not be in a recession but households are about to feel as though they are","body":"It is a good time to be a big grocery company, or a mining company, or a travel company, or a bank or … well, let’s be honest: as the Bureau of Statistics reported when inflation took off at the start of last year, “Australian businesses benefited from rising prices.” And they have continued to benefit in the year that has followed. Whether it is Jonathan Barrett’s report showing increased profit margins for Coles and Woolworths or the UBS research showing those two companies’ prices have risen faster than inflation, or Qantas being on track to deliver a record profit, or banks recording stonking profits as interest rates have risen – those wanting to argue Australian companies have not used the inflationary environment to increase prices are starting to look a bit naive. One of the worst things about economic debate in this country – and, to be honest, most others as well – is the view that company profits are a pure gain for the economy. More profits are always better.

Related: Wages are growing (good news!) but they’re still playing catch-up with inflation | Greg Jericho Households spend, businesses record profits and employ workers, paying them more wages. At least that is how it is supposed to go. And so when companies make record profits, we are reassured by politicians and business groups that all is well. But that neat function is not sustainable if wages and household incomes are failing to keep up with prices. If the graph does not display click here Because people are the economy, not companies. And at a certain point the people cry uncle and stop spending. This is where it starts to get worrying. Amid all the numbers in the federal budget, this month was a rather scary figure regarding household spending. Australian household spending is about half of the entire country’s economy. If households are not increasing their consumption, the economy is in trouble. And the budget expects that very thing to start happening. If the graph does not display click here Since the early 1980s there have been just four years where household consumption growth was below the 1.5% estimated for 2023-24: the 1990s recession, the global financial crisis, and twice during the pandemic. Worse still is that this predicted increase is due to population growth. Take away the expected 1.7% increase in population and per capita household consumption is set to fall for just the fourth time since 1985-86. Related: Inflation is coming back down, but Australia’s renters are still feeling the pain | Greg Jericho So, not good. You might think it’s just because we spent so much coming out of the pandemic, and that this is just a natural drop-off. Well, not really. During the pandemic, total household consumption fell, mostly due to a fall in spending on services. Now it is essentially only back to where we would have expected it to be before the pandemic. So, it is not like we are at a point where you would expect it to slow; rather, you would expect it to carry on like before the pandemic. If the graph does not display click here And yet the latest retail figures give us a sign of what is to come. Take spending on food. There certainly has been a huge increase in how many dollars we spend on food – well above what you would have expected before the pandemic: If the graph does not display click here This would have you believe we are buying food like crazy but, when we look at the volume of food bought, the picture is starkly different: If the graph does not display click here We are now buying about 5% less food than expected before the pandemic. It’s just costing more. This trend, sadly, is not limited to food. During the pandemic we spent like crazy on household goods. But now, not only are we reducing the volume of items we are buying, but also the dollar amount. If the graph does not display click here Retail spending, much like total household consumption, is basically back where it is expected to be: If the graph does not display click here But remember that retail is only part of what households spend their money on. And crucially, the Reserve Bank is doing what it can to make us stop spending on retail. Raising the cash rate 11 times since April last year has increased the average repayments on a mortgage by 79%: If the graph does not display click here The RBA did this to slow household spending, to reduce activity in the economy and crucially, to increase the number of unemployed people. It seems to be working. In a couple of weeks the next GDP figures will be released. Due to our mining exports there is little sense that the economy is about to be in a recession. But if household consumption goes the way Treasury expects, households are about to feel as if they are in one.

Kemi Badenoch, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss and Tom Tugendhat featured in a programme hosted by Krishnan Guru-Murthy. In an often difficult night for all the candidates, Sunak openly ridiculed Truss’s tax plans. Condemning what he called a wider “unfunded spree of borrowing and more debt” among his competitors, he condemned the Truss’s proposal to put off repayments of public debt built up due to Covid. “There is no such thing as Covid debt,” a visibly irritated Sunak told the foreign secretary. “Debt is debt. And the answer to too much borrowing can’t be yet more borrowing. It’s as simple as that.” Mordaunt and Badenoch clash with visible enmity about the former’s views on trans rights. Mordaunt, meanwhile, asked about negative briefings about her from some of the other camps, refused to say she trusted the other candidates. A long section on trust saw none of the five willing say whether the prime minister they hope to replace, Boris Johnson, was honest. “Sometimes,” said Badenoch, while Mordaunt talked about “really severe issues”, and Truss spoke of “mistakes”. Tugendhat won applause by saying, simply: “No.” Related: Tory leadership rivals clash over trust and ‘fairytale’ economic plans Despite pressure from some Tory grandees including former Brexit minister David Frost to unite behind a single candidate representing the right of the party, Badenoch’s team said “She has no intention of stepping down and is in it to win.” It was revealed that Mordaunt has repeatedly advocated the use of homeopathy on the NHS. Homeopathy is a treatment based on the use of highly diluted substances that practitioners claim can cause the body to heal itself. Badenoch and Truss have declined to answer questions put to them by the LGBT+ Conservatives group by their deadline of 1pm today. The group gave each of the leadership contenders a three-question questionnaire. Tugendhat, Sunak and Mordaunt managed to answer on time, although the group has since reached out to Badenoch and Truss to encourage them to submit their answers. Boris Johnson is planning to stage parliamentary interventions on Ukraine, Brexit and levelling up, with allies of the outgoing prime minister hinting that those are the areas of his legacy he believes to be most under threat from his potential successor. Channel 4 has said an investigation into allegations made by the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, that a reality TV show she appeared on used paid actors has found no evidence of fakery.

He says “she has the right stuff”. Kemi is winning among Newsnight jury - she has the right stuff — Michael Gove (@michaelgove) July 15, 2022 11.01pm BST This is what Sam Coates, the deputy political editor as Sky News, had to say in his live analysis earlier when the debate had concluded. He suggested it was a strong performance from Rishi Sunak, and a tough night for Liz Truss: Tonight was dominated by two things, the issue of trust and the economy. And what was really striking was the ability of Rishi Sunak to drag that debate about the economy onto his own terms. He grilled both Penny Mordaunt and Liz Truss about their tax plans. Whether the nation could afford them. Whether or not they might increase inflation. He was the one framing the argument and putting the others under pressure, even though arguably his plan, which is not so much help now as those two, is a harder sell on the country. He went on to say about the current foreign secretary: Tonight also mattered for Liz Truss. Bits of her pitch were clearly quite tough. She is essentially standing by her decision not to resign from Boris Johnson’s government, and pledging her loyalty to him even now, but it didn’t look like it went down particularly well with the audience. 10.50pm BST I do sometimes subscribe to the view that if your candidate has done or said something daft, it is best to lean into it on social media on the basis that “any publicity is good publicity” and “people will be talking about us rather than someone else.” So while confessing I may be about to fall into that trap, there appears to be a lot of confusion on social media about just quite what Penny Mordaunt meant by this statement – “The top 180 innovations that we have had. How many are used in the NHS. None” – or why her social media team would then make it into a graphic. As you can probably imagine, the quote tweets of it have been a sight to behold, not least a procession of NHS staff pointing some pretty basic “innovations” they use like the wheel and electricity, or the good old fall-back to a Monty Python reference: “Aside from the internet, penicillin, recombinant antibodies, MRI scanners, CAT scans, lateral flow tests … what inventions has the NHS ever used?” Update: the relevant tweet was later deleted, so a screenshot has been added. Updated at 11.36pm BST 10.39pm BST Harry Lambert offers this analysis of tonight over at the New Statesman: Liz Truss has the backing of 64 MPs but no wavering MP can be encouraged to join her camp after tonight’s showing. That was no surprise – I suggested Truss would perform poorly tonight, as anyone else who has watched the foreign secretary try to navigate questions on air before would probably have done, and I think the Tory right would be wise to drop her and swing behind Kemi Badenoch (who is fourth among MPs, with the backing of 49). Badenoch was the calmer and more assured performer this evening. But I do not expect the Tory right to align, and that will keep Mordaunt on the path to a run-off with Sunak.

For the Mail, it is news of a “Liz tax boost for families” as they tout a plan from the Truss camp for “a radical overhaul of the tax system.” “She wants to ensure parents are not penalised for time out of work to look after family members,” the paper says, adding that “couples with young children or caring responsibilities.” It also refers to her as Miss Truss on the front page.

It feels longer. So much longer. Time bends and stalls when you’re in the parallel universe of a Liz Truss speech. She leaves audiences begging for a lethal injection. The other leadership contenders are little better, registering mostly as absences on the space-time continuum. Negative energy. But we are where we are and we have moved on to the first of the televised debates, a weird gameshow where the only audience that counts are the 360 or so Tory MPs who may or may not be watching. The rest of us are merely voyeurs, having no say in which two clowns will still be standing by next Wednesday evening. This is apparently how the UK likes to choose its prime minister these days. Very on brand for a country that has become a laughing stock. First, though, there was a warm-up Zoom hustings on the Conservative Home website. Think a weekly meeting of junior sales reps. Only infinitely more boring. It’s almost as if no one really wants the job. Which would actually suit the rest of us. The only highlights were the flatlining Truss forgetting to unmute herself – she’s at her most articulate when you can’t hear her – and Ready4Rish! suggesting that his biggest fault is his perfectionism. I’d say a far greater fault was being in charge of an economy that is predicted to have the second lowest growth in the G20. If he was a real perfectionist he’d have made sure we were bottom. The other three – Penny Mordaunt, Tom Tugendhat and Kemi Badenoch – said nothing memorable at all. Which meant they easily came out on top.

Truss said: When I started in the Women and Equalities job, there was a plan to move forward on self-ID. I believe in women’s rights. I also believe that transgender people should be treated with respect. So what I did is I changed the outcome of that work, so that we were able to make the process simpler and kinder, but not move ahead with self-ID. Which I think is the right position, because I think people understand that women’s faces domestic violence shelters need to be protected for women, but at the same time, everybody is should be free to live their lives as they want and be treated with respect. So that is the balance I sought to achieve. \uD83D\uDCAC Everybody should be free to live their lives as they want and be treated with respect.#LizForLeader #C4LeaderDebate pic.twitter.com/dnishyk9zF — Liz for Leader (@trussliz) July 15, 2022 Truss did get cut off for exceeding her 45 seconds in her final speech, which may have made it a less appealing clip to use. 10.07pm BST Over on social media, it has not gone unnoticed that Liz Truss was very much cosplaying as Margaret Thatcher tonight, even down to a specific outfit Thatcher wore in a 1979 election broadcast.

In the Leadership debate there were no questions about how they would reform government and slim down a top heavy expensive No 10. They need to show the way by delivering more with less. — John Redwood (@johnredwood) July 15, 2022 9.58pm BST Full report: Tory leadership race explodes into acrimony during TV debate Here is Peter Walker’s report on tonight: The Conservative leadership race has exploded into acrimony and recrimination after the first televised debate saw open arguments over tax and identity politics with also none of the five candidates willing to say Boris Johnson is honest. Coming hours after Liz Truss sought to reinvigorate her faltering campaign with a sudden announcement of new tax cuts costing more than £20bn a year, Rishi Sunak the ex-chancellor, openly ridiculed his former colleague’s plans during the Channel 4 broadcast on Friday evening. Condemning what he called a wider “unfunded spree of borrowing and more debt” among his competitors, Sunak condemned the Truss’s proposal to put off repayments of public debt built up due to Covid. “There is no such thing as Covid debt,” a visibly irritated Sunak told the foreign secretary. “Debt is debt. And the answer to too much borrowing can’t be yet more borrowing. It’s as simple as that.” When Truss argued that better monetary policy would mitigate inflation even with tax cuts, Sunak snapped: “Liz, we have to be honest. Borrowing your way out of inflation isn’t a plan, it’s a fairytale.” In an often difficult night for all the candidates – also comprising Penny Mordaunt, the trade minister and bookmakers’ favourite; the former levelling up minister Kemi Badenoch; and the backbencher Tom Tugendhat – not a single member of the audience of floating voters raised their hands when asked if they trusted politicians. A long section on trust saw none of the five willing say whether Johnson was honest. “Sometimes,” said Badenoch, while Mordaunt talked about “really severe issues”, and Truss spoke of “mistakes”. Tugendhat won applause by saying, simply: “No.” A separate show of hands after a debate on energy bills saw just three people say they felt politicians were doing enough to help people. When asked at the end of the debate if it had made them more likely to vote Conservative, only 10 of the audience raised their hands.

One thing is clear - we need #ACleanStart. pic.twitter.com/F9QNRCrZch — Tom Tugendhat (@TomTugendhat) July 15, 2022 9.40pm BST I’ve put together my five key takeaways from tonight’s debate: Tom Tugendhat was the only one able to answer freely Given the opportunity to answer “Yes” or “No” to the question “is Boris Johnson honest?”, Tom Tugendhat was the only person able to do it. He got warm applause for simply saying: “No”. Truss has a delivery mantra problem Truss tried to focus again and again about delivery in every department, saying that her trade deals with Australia and Japan had been considered impossible, and that she had stood up to Vladimir Putin. But it all felt heavily scripted from her. Sunak’s Treasury experience is a potential asset – but not with party members Frequently during the debate he demonstrated a better command of the numbers and Treasury brief, but you still ended up with the feeling that a man instinctively fiscally conservative is being pushed into a corner and portrayed as a leftist for not wanting to cut taxes. Trans rights questions are not going away for Mordaunt The trade minister claimed to be baffled that anybody found her position unclear. It may not be high up the agenda when you poll voters on what they care about, but expect to see this get asked of the women standing to be PM again and again. There was little love in the room for any of the candidates It wasn’t a feral BBC Question Time audience, but at times, particularly when issues around trust and Partygate were being touched upon, the disdain for the audience with politicians was palpable. Whoever wins out of this contest in the end, they have an uphill climb. There’s more here: Five key takeaways from the first Conservative leadership debate Related: Five key takeaways from the first Conservative leadership debate 9.35pm BST Henry Zeffman at the Times has pinpointed the exchange in the middle where Truss and Sunak were at odds about future tax and borrowing plans. He writes: After a tieless and relaxed Rishi Sunak explained why he believes tackling inflation is more important than tax cuts and warned against more government borrowing, Liz Truss saw her moment. She reeled off a list of countries that are borrowing more than the UK, adding: “I believe they’re taking the right approach and we should take a similar approach.” Sunak has had three years of practice at explaining the abstractions of fiscal and monetary policy in digestible, human terms — and it showed. But it is important to remember how eager Conservative MPs and the Conservative base are for tax cuts. Sunak’s position has the advantage of being clear and firm, but it remains a position that many of his colleagues loathe. Truss stands robustly on the other side of that divide. 9.30pm BST Here is a set of assessments from my colleague Peter Walker, who ultimately called the night a victory for Keir Starmer. Final assessments: Sunak: did quite well, mainly punchy interventions on economics/tax. But he's still the legacy man, Johnson's no 2 - and that's a problem. Mordaunt: sounded fluent, no big errors, but equally hard to remember much of what she said. — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) July 15, 2022 Truss: a tough night. A bit wooden, as ever. Got the worst of the tax exchanges. Badenoch: Actually said a few interesting things (and a few odd ones), but she still won't make the final two. Tugendhat: Possibly the best performance - but he's still out of the race on Monday. — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) July 15, 2022 And finally: Starmer: often criticised for just sitting back and letting his opponents make tear each other apart, but paid off handsomely this time. Tonight's winner. — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) July 15, 2022 9.12pm BST Snap verdict Even though this was a one-party TV debate, the spin room will still be all about people who backed a particular candidate saying their particular candidate did best, but I’ll bring you some reaction to the debate shortly. My quick tuppence is that Rishi Sunak didn’t do anything to torpedo his position as current front-runner among MPs, even if he may not have put in a performance that would wow the public. Tugendhat was clearly the most likeable candidate to the audience in the studio, but isn’t really credibly likely to get into the last two, which leaves Badenoch, Truss and Mordaunt. I don’t think any of the three of them had a particular stellar evening. I didn’t feel that Mordaunt shone, Truss maybe had her best moments when she was toe-to-toe with Sunak over tax and borrowing (even if you think he is more fiscally credible), and Badenoch was quite good at bringing things back to a personal level, but her platform of “speaking the truth” is still quite light on actual policies. Here’s some interesting snap polling from Opinium, showing good news for Tugendhat – as far as the public is concerned at any rate. \uD83D\uDEA8BREAKING - SNAP DEBATE POLL\uD83D\uDEA8 Tonight we asked over 1000 normal voters to watch the debate and we have just asked them who they thought performed best.

Among Tory 2019 voters it was a neck and neck between Tugendhat and Sunak. However, among Conservative swing voters (who will decide whether the Tories hold their majority at the next election) the results were: Tugendhat 33% Sunak 28% Mordaunt 14% Badenoch 12% Truss 6% pic.twitter.com/A3Xrq4nioD — Opinium (@OpiniumResearch) July 15, 2022 Updated at 9.24pm BST 9.06pm BST Closing statement: Liz Truss The foreign secretary went last, and said this in her 45 seconds: We face grave challenges as a country, the worst economic crisis for a generation, an appalling war perpetrated by Russia in Ukraine, after decades of very slow growth. Now is not the time for a continuity of our current economic policy. We need to be bold. We need to do things differently. We need to cut taxes. We need to unleash growth. And we need to unleash the potential of all of the people across our great country. I’m somebody who can go into Downing Street on day one, and get the job done. I’ve got a record of delivery in every department I’ve been in, whether it’s striking trade deals in Australia and Japan. [Truss ran out of time at this point] 9.04pm BST Closing statement: Rishi Sunak The ex-Chancellor, who helped oust Boris Johnson with his dramatic resignation last week, said this as his closing statement: We’ve had a robust debate tonight, but we agree on much. We all want to cut taxes, so people keep more of their own money. We all want to improve public services. We all want secure borders. But the choice at this election is who can be trusted to grip this moment. And get things done. I love our country. And be in no doubt, we’re going to build a better future for our children and grandchildren. But nothing worth having ever comes easy. So the question is simple. Do we confront the challenges facing our country honestly and responsibly, or not? For me, there is only one answer. 9.03pm BST Closing statement: Penny Mordaunt Here is what Penny Mordaunt said in her 45 seconds: I’m very aware that while my party chooses a new leader, you are watching us pick your next prime minister. And that is why this contest must be about you, your lives, and your ambitions ,and your immediate worries. And as a Conservative, I hope you like at least one of us. But it should matter to you. So thank you for watching. At some point, all of you will have a vote. And you will see that not all politicians are the same. I’m not the traditional offer. I’m not the legacy candidate. I’m focused on the future. And I want our nation to be all it can be, and to shine with the newfound freedoms our great democracy has determined it would. 9.01pm BST Closing statement: Tom Tugendhat Tom Tugendhat went second: Thank you very much for watching this evening, because this evening isn’t actually about us. It’s not just about the Conservative Party. It’s about you, your country and your prime minister. So please get in touch with your MP, and tell them what you think. Tell them who you want them to support in the third Conservative leadership round, because the country is going through a crisis at home and challenges abroad. What we’re seeing around the world is, we’re seeing division and disunity, and we can pull people together. What we can do is we can turn this around. Now we know that people are asking the right question, people tonight have been asking the right question. We need a clean start. We all know that. But some of us some of us have the answer. Now I have a track record of leadership. I have led army operations and I have led in Parliament and times and now I would like to lead the United Kingdom. 8.59pm BST Closing statement: Kemi Badenoch Kemi Badenoch gave the first 45 second closing statement: It’s time to tell the truth. The truth is, unless we change, we will fail. I love this country. I chose it when I was 16. It is the best place in the world. Nowhere else on the planet would give me the opportunity, standing in front of the nation, asking for the honour of being the leader of the government. And yet our country can still be so much better. Better for those working hard to make ends meet, like I did on minimum wage, flipping burgers at McDonald’s all those years ago. Better for all our children. I will fight as hard for yours as I do for my three kids, protecting their future by looking after our environment, improving schools, and creating a strong economy and we will do all this with better government. The machine is not working. As an engineer. I know how to strip things down and get them to work. And with me as your prime minister, we will have the change for the better, and that’s the honest truth. 8.54pm BST The candidates are doing 45 second closing pitches. I’ll have them all in turn. 8.51pm BST The Observer’s Michael Savage … It's impossible to see a dentist, the NHS is in crisis, urgent action is needed on energy bills. Labour's messages being delivered by those bidding to be the next Conservative PM. — Michael Savage (@michaelsavage) July 15, 2022 8.50pm BST Final section: the green economy The final question is about how these candidates would build a green economy. “It’s really important that we hit those interim [net zero] targets,” says Penny Mordaunt. “But …” That sums up much of the climate debate there has been during this contest, where scrapping green levies looks like being a vote-winner with Tory grassroots, even as the country has its first national red hot weather alert. Rishi Sunak says he cares about the environment because of his kids, but that we have to go at the right speed otherwise all people hear is higher bills. Updated at 8.51pm BST 8.47pm BST Tom Tugendhat has just made a big emotional pitch saying the NHS had saved the lives of his army colleagues and “it may have been the air force who picked them up” but it was the NHS who kept them living. Then he bizarrely said “And you’ve also given me two children”. To the NHS worker who asked the question. “Not you personally” he hastily added, but it was the first completely unprompted gaffe of the evening. 8.44pm BST There’s a – not entirely implausible – suggestion here that actually some of the candidates tonight are playing a totally different game. Suspect the polls and focus groups will declare Sunak and Tugendhat the winners - both are playing to the country and doing a decent job of it - but Truss and Badenoch clearly playing more to the selectorate of Tory members who ultimately are the people who matter most in this. — Ben Kentish (@BenKentish) July 15, 2022 8.43pm BST Fourth section: NHS “It’s heroic and we owe you an enormous debt of gratitude” – Rishi Sunak responds to a question from someone who works in the NHS and generates a round of applause for them. “I know the challenges you are facing” he says. Kemi Badenoch says the backlog is terrifying, and starts talking about her own struggle to get seen for a chipped tooth. “It is an emergency situation” she says. Badenoch says the NHS has more money, but more pressures. “There must be things we can do differently” she says. Badenoch is in favour of cancelling the National Insurance tax rise that was due to provide extra NHS funds. Updated at 8.44pm BST 8.36pm BST Rishi Sunak earns the first round of applause that didn’t go to Tom Tugendhat, with the ex-Chancellor saying that all the other candidates are proposing is “borrow, borrow, borrow, borrow” and that this will prolong inflation and the economic discomfort of the nation. Updated at 8.38pm BST 8.35pm BST More seriously, Sunak made a big play of the help that is being given already over energy prices. Badenoch was saying this was all taxpayers’ money still. Krishnan Guru-Murthy asks the audience for a show of hands - “are the government doing enough on energy bills?” – just two or three people put their hands up. 8.33pm BST Kemi Badenoch has just said “magic money tree”. If this was the Eurovision song contest live blog, I would tell you to have a swig. 8.30pm BST Tom Tugendhat says the energy crisis and Putin using it as a weapon against us is not new, and he says he’s been calling it out for years. He says he will cut fuel duty, and how the government delivers welfare better. He says we have to deliver nuclear, but “it’s not about jam tomorrow, it’s about heat today.” I’ve spent a long time covering TV political debates, and Tugendhat is essentially playing the minority party role here, free to just speak, call out the hypocrisy in everybody else, all the while safe in the knowledge there’s virtually zero chance he will end up as PM. 8.27pm BST Third section: energy The next question is on energy bills. Kemi Badenoch says it is a subject that worries her a lot, growing up in Nigeria with rolling black-outs. “We do need to tackle climate change but the crisis we are dealing with now comes first,” she says, pledging to ditch green energy levies. Liz Truss agrees saying “we are hammering consumers, we are hammering business” with the green levy. She then says we should be using gas as a transition fuel and produce more nuclear energy to get away from the dependence on Russian energy. Krishnan Guru-Murthy starts trying to get Truss into the weeds of exact numbers. Truss says if she is PM, we’ll start investing in the energy “we should have invested in ages ago”. She is currently in the government. Updated at 8.37pm BST 8.22pm BST Tom Tugendhat has said that when, as Chancellor, Rishi Sunak was trying to persuade Tugendhat to vote for tax rises, the reason Sunak gave was “because the boss wanted it”. There is an audible gasp in the room. And it leaves an open question about Sunak’s tactics … Rishi Sunak walking into being absolutely flattened because he attacked Tom Tugendhat, a man who is going out next round anyway. Why? — Stephen Bush (@stephenkb) July 15, 2022 8.18pm BST Liz Truss has said you can’t tax your way to growth, and is proposing that she wants to see low-tax zones around the country “I’m slightly surprised,” says Tom Tugendhat, “because I was the only person who didn’t vote for the National Insurance rise, and now I find everyone agrees with me.” 8.13pm BST Kemi Badenoch says that one of the problems with modern politics is that people present simple answers, but, she says, “there are no solutions, there are only trade offs.” Mordaunt disagrees. “There are some solutions” she says. She says she is not a candidate of “tax and spend” but of “growth”. Updated at 8.19pm BST 8.12pm BST My colleague Peter Walker making the point that it is an incredible “Overton window” shift that Rishi Sunak is being portrayed as fiscally of the left. It says something for the prevailing view among Tory MPs that Rishi Sunak is able to pose, not without ridicule, as essentially the protector of public services. — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) July 15, 2022 8.10pm BST Second section: tax In the earlier ConservativeHome hustings this morning, the current UK foreign secretary Liz Truss blurted out two new tax cut policies from her if she was to be PM. Asked how she would pay for it, she says “By spreading the debt we accumulated through Covid over a longer period. Covid is a once in a hundred year event, we need to pay it over a longer time.” Updated at 8.36pm BST 8.07pm BST Sky’s political editor Beth Rigby thinks that Krishnan Guru-Murthy is going a great job.

Truss is making the Maybot look human — John Crace (@JohnJCrace) July 15, 2022 8.05pm BST Ruth Wells has emailed me to say we should be playing bingo every time that Liz Truss says the word “deliver”. I had contemplated a game where we had a drink every time someone mentioned Labour. So far, as a show of how much of an internal Tory party debate this is, I think we’d have only had one or two shots at most. 8.03pm BST Penny Mordaunt mentioned women’s sport just now. If you’ve already had enough of all this, then you can flick over to BBC One and watch England vs Northern Ireland in Euro 2022 and keep following the debate on the live blog. Or stick with the debate on the TV, but open a new tab and follow the match with my colleague Rob Smyth on his live blog. Either way, unlike Keir Starmer at PMQs the other week, we haven’t forgotten that Northern Ireland are in the tournament. Updated at 8.14pm BST 8.01pm BST Badenoch, Mordaunt and Truss are now being pressed about “What is a woman”. Badenoch appears to be heckling “Tell the truth Liz”. All three of them seem to be saying that trans woman are vulnerable people who can live their lives as they want, and legally can be considered women, but aren’t biologically women. Trans rights has been perceived as a wedge issue that Conservatives can make Labour uncomfortable on, but the apparent contradictions in positions that Mordaunt appears to have held have made it uncomfortable for her too. \"I'm a woman, I'm a biological woman, if I had a vasectomy I'd still be a woman.\" Penny Mordaunt clashes with fellow Conservative party leadership candidates Kemi Badenoch and Liz Truss over her record on trans rights. #C4LeaderDebate pic.twitter.com/z52FGMmSqk — Channel 4 News (@Channel4News) July 15, 2022 Updated at 8.32pm BST 7.58pm BST Ton Tugendhat is saying that it isn’t a secret that you can’t make a set of rules and not follow them. That’s an awkward moment for Rishi Sunak. Krishnan Guru-Murthy makes Sunak follow up on it, he has to apologise again and then says the only reason he was there to get a fine for breaking Covid rules was because he was there working every day on Covid. A cutaway shows a woman in the audience shaking her head – she’s potentially a meme now. Kemi Badenoch is asked is what Sunak said OK with her. She said it is. Guru-Murthy asks the audience to show their hands if they trust politicians. Nobody raises their hand. Hashtag awks etc. Updated at 8.00pm BST 7.54pm BST My colleague Peter Walker makes the point that these candidates have been pretty sheltered so far from public anger about Boris Johnson in this kind of forum. He tweets: This is the candidates’ first exposure to voters, all floating ones, and it’s clear they’re getting a pretty bracing exposure as to how toxic Johnson’s legacy really is.

Badenoch goes first and says “sometimes”. Mordaunt, Sunak and Truss prevaricate somewhat. Tom Tugendhat gets warm applause for simply saying “No”. The debate has gone to a commercial break. Updated at 8.00pm BST 7.46pm BST The real danger that we’ve got at the moment is that at the next election Labour would use the Conservatives’ record in government against them, says Tom Tugendhat. Updated at 7.48pm BST 7.44pm BST Liz Truss says she does trust all the colleagues on the panel, Sunak says he trusts all of them, “we’ve all worked together and we are all the same team.” Updated at 8.13pm BST 7.43pm BST Penny Mordaunt says we need to pull together as a country, a bond between politicians, business, charity sector, communities. “I have spoken truth to power,” she says, and says she turned down a higher job in the government. “We are all responsible for our own campaigns and I take it as a big fat compliment” that people are running campaigns against her. She avoided the direct question “do you trust the other candidates?” Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss during the debate.

Told she is the least recognised of the candidates so would she call an election, she says she wouldn’t because otherwise she wouldn’t have a chance to prove herself. 7.40pm BST Rishi Sunak says he always tried to give Johnson the benefit of doubt, and that it was clear he had a disagreement with the PM about economy. He says that is why you should trust him, “I’m willing to say difficult things.” He cites furlough, the vaccine rollout and standing up to Putin as things he was proud of, before “enough was enough”. “I want to be honest about the challenges we face as a country” Rishi Sunak sets out why he resigned and why he can be trusted to lead the country.#Ready4Rishi #C4LeaderDebate Sign up\uD83D\uDC49 https://t.co/3cXn1rnFNA pic.twitter.com/dwty40exwD — Ready For Rishi (@RishiSunak) July 15, 2022 [I’ve already got the spelling of Tugendhat wrong once, apologies, it’s going to be a long night] Updated at 7.56pm BST 7.37pm BST Tom Tugendhat says trust has been an issue for a long time and that “it is easy to stand up your enemies, it is harder to stand up to your friends”. He says he has held up a mirror, asking his colleagues “are you serving the people of the UK, or are you serving your career?” Updated at 7.37pm BST 7.36pm BST First section: trust The first question is: ‘Why should the public trust any of you?’ Liz Truss goes first, she says she secured trade deals people said were impossible, with Australia, Japan, she says she’s taken on Putin, she’s taken on Brexit and the Northern Ireland protocol bill. “I haven’t over-promised” she says, perhaps tapping at a weakness of outgoing prime minister Boris Johnson.

Don’t let that put you off. \"What are you doing on this lush Friday evening in mid-July?\" \"Staying in and watching the #Toryleadership debate,\" said no-one ever, unless it's literally their job to — Ben Glaze (@benglaze) July 15, 2022 7.27pm BST I am going to be honest, and say that I am a little baffled that we are about to watch 90 minutes of five candidates for the leadership of the party that has been in power for 12 years argue with each other that only they personally can provide the clean start and refresh that the country desperately needs. After they’ve been in power for 12 years. Most of them actually in government personally as ministers for at least some of that time. But here we all are. Updated at 7.33pm BST 7.25pm BST First Tory leadership debate begins The five remaining candidates to be the next prime minister of the UK are taking part in the first televised debate of the contest, scheduled to start at 7.30pm in the UK. Kemi Badenoch, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss and Tom Tugendhat will all be taking part in the debate which will be broadcast by Channel 4 and hosted by Krishnan Guru-Murthy. The five will face questions from an audience that the channel has described as “floating voters”, who they have been recruiting over the last few days. While the debate is a public television spectacle, the only people currently able to vote for the candidates are Conservative MPs, who will whittle the candidates down to two by the end of next week. They will then be put to a postal ballot of Conservative party members. The new prime minister is expected to be in place by 5 September. A second debate will air on ITV from 7pm on Sunday 17 July, with a third debate scheduled for Tuesday 19 July. That is expected to feature fewer candidates after further rounds of voting have taken place in Westminster. You will be able to follow all of the debates live on the Guardian website. This is Martin Belam in London liveblogging the debate this evening. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com or at @MartinBelam on Twitter. Updated at 7.31pm BST 7.22pm BST There are 10 minutes to go before the Channel 4 Conservative leadership debate kicks off. Someone I suspect who won’t be watching tonight, because they will be very much in the pighouse, is “Mystic Marcus”. He was on ITV earlier this week, and given the chance to pick an apple with a candidate’s name on it, “Mystic Marcus” picked Suella Braverman as the next PM. Braverman has now offered her support to Liz Truss, having been eliminated from the race. The second nibble that “Mystic Marcus” gave on the day was for Penny Mordaunt’s apple. So who knows? And if you doubt the credentials of “Mystic Marcus”, we featured him in 2018 after he rose to fame for apparently correctly predicting Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, and his owner Juliet told ITV this week “Marcus is the seventh pig of a seventh pig and apparently if you’re the seventh child of a seventh child, you can have very good mystic powers.” ‘Mystic Marcus the psychic pig’ successfully predicting a world cup match on TV in 2018. Bless him.

It may be a chance to speak to the country, but at the moment the only people whose votes count are fellow Conservative MPs who can back him in the next round in Westminster I'm trying to be your Prime Minister.

Updated at 7.32pm BST 6.56pm BST Allegra Stratton, no stranger to No 10, has a piece on Bloomberg this evening where she lists the questions that Bloomberg journalists and staffers would ask tonight. They include: “How can you unite a fractured Conservative party and rebuild trust with the public?” from Joe Mayes. “How do you create political space for meaningful talks with the EU on trade while Tory MPs and grassroots members want even more distant ties?” from Stuart Biggs. “For health, for teachers, for police — what is an acceptable public sector pay settlement?” from Philip Aldrick. “Will the UK continue to export power and gas to Europe if supplies run short?” from Rachel Morrison. Read more here: Bloomberg – What We Would Ask the Next PM? Updated at 7.33pm BST 6.41pm BST The Financial Times editorial board have come out with a piece in the last half hour saying that “the UK’s prime minister will be chosen based on fantasies”. They write: The Conservative party’s contest to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister has an air of fantasy. Listening to the candidates, you would not know that spiralling energy costs are causing misery to households, and inflation is now broadening to most goods and services. Or that simmering disputes over pay and conditions promise a prolonged period of industrial unrest. You certainly would hear little about the UK’s longer term challenge of sluggish growth, made worse by poor planning regulations and the exit from the EU. Instead, the candidates are competing largely on a single issue of if and when they will cut taxes. Read more here: Financial Times – The UK’s prime minister will be chosen based on fantasies [£] Updated at 7.33pm BST 6.36pm BST ITV have a story this evening, which they are labelling an exclusive, in which they say they have seen a document outlining a plan “to create 39 new Tory-supporting lords as a matter of urgency, to push through contentious legislation.” It doesn’t originate from within government however, but from Sir Lynton Crosby’s lobbying group, which ITV describes as “the most influential political lobby group that advises the prime minister.” Given that he is the outgoing prime minister, it may not be that big a deal, but there was one eye-catching line. The report says analysis shows “if there had been around 40 additional committed Tory supporters in the Lords, Boris Johnson would have avoided more than half of the defeats he suffered in the second chamber since becoming prime minister.” With nearly 800 members in the House of Lords already, any expansion would push the UK even closer to being the largest legislature on Earth. Currently only China – population 1.4 billion – has more lawmakers than there are in London. Updated at 7.33pm BST 6.06pm BST Anushka Asthana, ITV News’ deputy political editor and also previously of this parish, has posted what she says is a screengrab from some annoyed members of the Conservative ERG group – Michael Fabricant and Lee Anderson – dismayed at having been told who to vote for. Reports earlier that Michael Fabricant was another MP annoyed by ERG order to back Truss. Here is what he responded to a similar annoyed message from Lee Anderson \uD83D\uDC47 pic.twitter.com/BDspDs6Jik — Anushka Asthana (@AnushkaAsthana) July 15, 2022 Updated at 7.34pm BST 5.55pm BST Penny Mordaunt supporter James Sunderland, who is MP for Bracknell, has been interviewed on Sky News about her leadership bid. He said that a low recognisability factor with the public, according to polls, was not an issue, saying “notoriety isn’t necessarily a good thing.” He also said that Mordaunt had more ministerial experience than Tony Blair, David Cameron or Boris Johnson had when stepping into the role of prime minister. This illustrates a difficult line that the candidates are trying to tread, arguing they have had plenty of experience while the Conservatives have been in power during the last 12 years, while also arguing that the country needs a reset and a fresh start. Sunderland was asked whether the party would find her “woke”, and said “This is a politician who gets it, and actually she’s not ‘woke’, her views are to the right of the party. She’s going to deliver Brexit. She’s firm on law and order. And if you listen to her this week in the hustings, and again tonight, you’ll find that she’s pretty strong.” He said: “I have heard from multiple sources within Westminster, this week from many Labour colleagues that I speak to, that she is the one contender that Labour most fears.” And in comments that are unlikely to delight everyone in Scotland, he also said she would “bring the SNP to heel”. Updated at 7.35pm BST 5.39pm BST Badenoch 'has no intention' of dropping out of race Of the five candidates who will be appearing in the Channel 4 debate tonight, Kemi Badenoch and Tom Tugendhat are the two under the most pressure to step aside to streamline the contest before Conservative MPs vote again next week. Given that they are currently guaranteed a spot in tonight’s debate, and again on ITV on Sunday, it seems unlikely they would do so. A spokesperson from Badenoch’s campaign, following David Frost’s suggestion in the Telegraph that she should duck out in favour of Liz Truss, said: Kemi has brought interesting ideas and a new approach to this leadership contest. She is looking forward to the debates this weekend. She has no intention of stepping down and is in it to win. This is Martin Belam in London taking over the live blog for the evening. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com or at @MartinBelam on Twitter. Updated at 5.41pm BST 5.18pm BST As we approach the first television debate of this Conservative leadership contest, Mark Lawson writes for us that Penny Mordaunt’s previous TV appearances might turn out to be an asset for her: The selection of the next prime minister has reached the stage at which television may be decisive. Across three peak-time slots – on Channel 4 (Friday), ITV (Sunday) and Sky News (Monday) – the remaining candidates debate live. Biographers of Boris Johnson and Donald Trump will see as the key dates in their political careers 2017-21 and 2019-22, the years in which they governed the US and UK. But it can be argued that the most important days on their legislative calendar were 29 November 2002, and 8 January 2004, when Johnson and Trump presented, respectively, their first editions of Have I Got News For You?, and The Apprentice. To the joy of TV journalists compiling emergency profiles of Penny Mordaunt, she appeared in the second series of Tom Daley’s ITV celebrity diving competition, Splash!, in 2014. At the moment, it seems that Mordaunt’s reality TV past has been good for her: one of the MPs supporting her, Bob Stewart, even used her returning to the high board after a belly flop as a metaphor for the resilience necessary to run Britain.

The five hopefuls go again tonight live on Channel 4 at 7.30pm. But, for now, here is a round-up of all the day’s top headlines: MPs on the Commons privileges committee will carry out a site visit in Downing Street, and are demanding No 10 hand over evidence, including WhatsApps, photos and diary entries, as they investigate whether Boris Johnson misled parliament over Partygate. Tory party leadership hopeful Penny Mordaunt claimed her rivals were trying to stop her but declined to be drawn into criticising other candidates. Speaking to Sky News on Friday morning, she said she was aware that she posed a threat to her rivals former chancellor Rishi Sunak and foreign secretary Liz Truss if she made it to the final vote by party members. Meanwhile, Truss has sought to breathe new life into her faltering campaign with a flurry of new tax cut promises worth billions of pounds, as the five remaining candidates took part in their first mass debate. Before a televised event on Channel 4 on Friday evening, Truss and the four other would-be successors to Boris Johnson joined a Zoom-based Q&A hosted by the Conservative Home website. Sunak, Mordaunt and Tom Tugendhat have committed to maintaining the government’s legally binding goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. The contenders for the Tory leadership have signed up to a series of pledges put forward by the Conservative Environment Network (CEN), including continuing with the post-Brexit nature-friendly farming subsidies and switching to renewable energy. Mordaunt, a leading contender to become prime minister, has repeatedly advocated the use of homeopathy on the NHS, analysis of her parliamentary records and public comments shows. Homeopathy is a treatment based on the use of highly diluted substances that practitioners claim can cause the body to heal itself. The former Brexit minister David Frost this morning urged Kemi Badenoch to pull out of the leadership contest to bolster Truss’s position in the race. Lord Frost also stepped up his attacks on the second-placed candidate Mordaunt, saying she was “absent on parade” when he worked with her on post-Brexit negotiations last year. Badenoch and Truss have declined to answer questions put to them by the LGBT+ Conservatives group by their deadline of 1pm today. The group gave each of the leadership contenders a three-question questionnaire. Tugendhat, Sunak and Mordaunt managed to answer on time, although the group has since reached out to Badenoch and Truss to encourage them to submit their answers. Boris Johnson is planning to stage parliamentary interventions on Ukraine, Brexit and levelling up, with allies of the outgoing prime minister hinting that those are the areas of his legacy he believes to be most under threat from his potential successor. Channel 4 has said an investigation into allegations made by the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, that a reality TV show she appeared on used paid actors has found no evidence of fakery. The broadcaster asked the producers of the 2010 reality show Tower Block of Commons, in which Dorries was one of a number of MPs who went to live in deprived communities, to investigate the claims she made to the culture select committee in May. The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, visited a section of the Berlin Wall earlier today while on a trip to the German capital to meet politicians and business leaders. Starmer was pictured by the landmark, erected in 1961 by the communist authorities to separate East and West Berlin. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. I’ll be back tomorrow morning. For now, my colleague Martin Belam will continue to bring you all the latest news and views from Westminster. Goodbye for now. Updated at 7.36pm BST 4.29pm BST What happens when the “most duplicitous, lying electorate that you’ve ever come across” holds an internal contest via secret ballots covered breathlessly by the media with the fate of the country at stake? That description of the race to become prime minister by the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith goes some way to explaining why there has been a torrent of blue-on-blue attacks, “dark arts” and betrayal of long-held loyalties over the past week. After MPs managed eventually to oust the prime minister, the relief of being able to select a new leader was only momentary before the infighting began again. Related: ‘Dark arts’ and betrayal: one week in the Tory leadership race 4.27pm BST In other news, Channel 4 has said an external investigation into allegations made by the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, that a reality TV show she appeared on used paid actors has found no evidence of fakery. The broadcaster asked the producers of the 2010 reality show Tower Block of Commons, in which Dorries was one of a number of MPs who went to live in deprived communities, to investigate the claims she made to the culture select committee in May. The outcome of the investigation, undertaken by Love Productions and overseen by external lawyers, was reviewed by Channel 4, which also conducted its own “internal document searches and review”. “The investigation encompassed contributors who were ordinary members of the public and with whom the secretary of state had significant interaction,” said Channel 4 in a statement on Friday.

The contenders for the Tory leadership have signed up to a raft of pledges put forward by the Conservative Environment Network (CEN), including continuing with the post-Brexit nature-friendly farming subsidies and switching to renewable energy. The other leadership candidates, Liz Truss and Kemi Badenoch, have not yet signed up to the pledges, though Truss has previously backed the 2050 target. Both have been contacted for comment.

Ahead of a televised event on Channel 4 on Friday evening, Truss and the four other would-be successors to Boris Johnson joined a Zoom-based Q&A hosted by the Conservative Home website. Penny Mordaunt, the bookmakers’ favourite, who is second in the number of Tory MP votes so far, used the debate to condemn what she called “mudslinging”, and to portray herself as the candidate best able to defeat Labour. Related: Liz Truss bids to save Tory leadership campaign with new tax cut pledges 4.02pm BST Penny Mordaunt repeatedly advocated use of homeopathy on NHS Penny Mordaunt, a leading contender to win the Conservative party leadership contest and become prime minister, has repeatedly advocated the use of homeopathy on the NHS, analysis of her parliamentary records and public comments shows. Homeopathy is a treatment based on the use of highly diluted substances that practitioners claim can cause the body to heal itself. It has been called bogus by the most senior doctor in the NHS, and the health service does not fund it because of “the lack of any evidence for its effectiveness”. The NHS position is backed by a high court judgment. “Homeopathy has no place in the NHS and is no replacement for rigorously tried and tested medical care,” Prof Stephen Powis, the NHS national medical director, has said previously. “We have been clear in our guidance to GPs that they should not be prescribing these bogus treatments, which are at best a placebo and a misuse of taxpayers’ money.” A Guardian analysis reveals that Mordaunt, the bookmakers’ favourite to replace Boris Johnson, has repeatedly expressed support for homeopathy and called for family doctors to be given the right to prescribe it. Related: Penny Mordaunt repeatedly advocated use of homeopathy on NHS 3.56pm BST The failed Tory leadership hopeful Suella Braverman has written to her supporters urging them to get behind Liz Truss. The Attorney General wrote: Other MPs and activists will make up their own minds who to support. Nobody can order them who to support and nor should they. But for those who want to support Kemi, I would say just this. Kemi is a great woman and a friend. She could do a fantastic job as PM one day but we need to look realistically at the numbers. Liz and Kemi are not both going to make it into the final two. So, a decision needs to be made to back one of them. The one we should back, I’d argue, is the one who can get to the final round: Liz can, Kemi cannot. Liz is undeniably the better-placed candidate to get to the voluntary party round and fight there for the things that all three of us believe. 3.47pm BST Now then, Penny Mordaunt. The candidate who, as she launched her campaign said she would get onto pressing issues in like dealing with a ailing economy, right after she’d dealt with a more critical (to her leadership bid) question: I hope in, in the next few days we’ll able to discuss how we get our economy growing again and enable our citizens to live well. Right now, I’d like to address another question that I’ve been asked: pic.twitter.com/OImF6kUVzx — Penny Mordaunt (@PennyMordaunt) July 9, 2022 I’ve done Mordaunt’s answers in full because they are fairly short: What are your main priorities for the LGBT+ community? Critical to delivering for the LGBT+ community at home and abroad is looking at how we improve the lives of LGBT+ people, especially access to public services and tackling discrimination at work. We must look at policy based based on the real experience of LGBT+ people. How will you tackle the rising problem of transphobia within the Conservative Party? Tackling discrimination wherever it rears its head is vital. The UK must be a force for good in the world to ensure we help and set an example to others developing their policies in this space. Why should our members get your vote? I would be honored to gain the support of our valued LGBT+ members. When I led London Pride Parade in 2019, I was proud to be representing country, armed forces, and also LGBT+ Conservatives. I want to ensure that every time you go to such events, you can be proud of your party and your country. 3.42pm BST The very modern Tom Tugendhat did a video! You’ll be surprised to hear that he mentions his time in the army. What are your main priorities for the LGBT+ community? The first thing is dignity, its quality and protection, because the reality is we have got a society that sometimes still sadly does discriminate. I was very pleased to be in the army when equality was brought into the army. [...] It made it better, it made it stronger and it made many people happier. I think it was a huge improvement. How will you tackle the rising problem of transphobia within the Conservative Party? Yes, but I’m hugely proud that Jamie Wallace is the first openly trans MP and of course he’s a conservative. So it’s fantastic that we have a very diverse party in many ways. We really need to reinforce dignity and respect and we need to bridge the trust between communities and groups, because if that’s the way we make, finding our party better and also stronger and more likely to win elections as well. Why should our members get your vote? I think we need a rebuilding of trust. And that’s important for all of us as Conservatives, we’re all just Conservatives, after all. But I think [for] the LGBT+ community in particular, what I’m offering I think is getting beyond the division of the past and trying to have a more unified message suddenly brings us together again, beyond wedge issues and actually focusing on what benefits for us all. Updated at 3.47pm BST 3.36pm BST Here’s an edited version of Sunak’s responses to the LGBT+ group, again you can see the full responses on their website. Rishi Sunak: What are your main priorities for the LGBT+ community? There is so much more we can do to take forward this country’s proud record of progress on LGBT+ rights. From ending new HIV transmissions by 2030, to addressing instances of hate crime, to fostering a more tolerant, accepting society. I want this to be the safest and greatest country in the world to be LGBT+. How will you tackle the rising problem of transphobia within the Conservative Party? Prejudice against trans people is wrong. The Conservative Party is an open, welcoming family to everybody across society, no matter who they are and irrespective of their background. Where we have disagreements, we must continue to ensure they are handled with respect and understanding. Robust debate and disagreement on policy issues must never descend into personal attacks. Why should our members get your vote? I pledge to continue to be an ally. But, if I’m lucky enough to be your next Prime Minister, I also pledge to work day and night to make Britain the kindest, safest and most vibrant place in the world to be LGBT +. My pledge is to make sure that none of you ever feel the need to hide, but can instead live life with hope, joy, and above all, pride. 3.33pm BST Kemi Badenoch and Liz Truss have declined to answer questions put to them by the LGBT+ Conservatives group by their deadline of 1pm today. The group each of the leadership contenders a three question questionnaire. Only Tom Tugendhat, Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt managed to answer on time, although the group have since reached out to Badenoch and Truss to encourage them to submit their answers, the group’s chair Elena Bunbary told me. She said: We have invited Kemi and Liz to still submit despite the deadline passing. We are hopeful that we will get to hear their thoughts and views on the questions posed, to allow our members the information they may want to cast their votes. You can read the responses from the three candidates that did in full on their website. The three questions each candidate was asked were: - What are your main priorities for the LGBT+ community? - How will you tackle the rising problem of transphobia within the Conservative Party? - Why should our @LGBTCons members get your vote? — LGBT+ Conservatives (@LGBTCons) July 13, 2022 I’ll outline a flavour of their responses in the next posts. 3.07pm BST Boris Johnson is planning to stage parliamentary interventions on Ukraine, Brexit and levelling up, with allies of the outgoing prime minister hinting that those are the areas of his legacy he believes to be most under threat from his potential successor. It comes as a briefing war between current and former No 10 aides exploded into new acrimony, with accusations traded about a working culture alleged to have been overtly macho and, at times, misogynistic. Johnson is said to have told his aides he has no intention of quitting parliament immediately, though he has stopped short of committing to staying until the next election. In a move that will fuel speculation Johnson has already mentally checked out of the job, the prime minister will hold a “thank you” party for loyal supporters and their families at Chequers this weekend. Johnson is said to have doubts about whether his successor is as committed to providing funds to sustain the Ukrainians fighting against the Russian invasion – as well as to changing the Northern Ireland protocol and the levelling up promise that the party will invest heavily in northern seats. Read the full story here: Related: Boris Johnson plans backbench interventions ‘to protect legacy’ Updated at 3.21pm BST 2.42pm BST Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he does not want to see more rail strikes. Speaking during a visit to Berlin on Friday, he said: I completely understand why people are frustrated about the cost of living crisis that this government has presided over but I don’t want strikes to go ahead, I don’t want to see strikes, I don’t think anybody does. They need to be resolved, that will only happen if the government lifts its finger and gets involved in resolving it, it hasn’t done that.

Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA Updated at 2.59pm BST 2.27pm BST On Wednesday night, dozens of journalists and political aides joined the Tory leadership hopeful Penny Mordaunt at a drinks event in the garden of Westminster Abbey. Guests such as Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK enjoyed plenty of wine and were joined by costume actors dressed as traditional British icons such as Beefeaters, Paddington Bear and Edina from Absolutely Fabulous. Mordaunt was the star of the party, which was held by a charity run by the multimillionaire PR agency boss Chris Lewis, an ally of Mordaunt over the last decade. Even amid growing public interest in the potential future prime minister, little attention has been paid to 61-year-old Lewis – a man who lists his job title as the “Grand Enchilada” and writes business leadership books. Related: Chris Lewis: the PR boss backing Penny Mordaunt to be PM 2.20pm BST Online hustings: closing statements We are into the closing statements now. Truss uses hers to talk about how she will continue to stand up to Putin over Ukraine and deliver the benefits of Brexit. Interestingly, she says she can defeat Ed Davey as well as Keir Starmer at a general election. Tugendhat says his clean start will deliver a “new party and new drive” and puts the focus on defending the UK. Badenoch says the government needs to renew and she lacks the “baggage of the last few years”. She supports a smaller state and will win back the seats lost in recent byelections, she says. Mordaunt says she is the only candidate who can defeat Labour in a general election, highlighting her recent positive poll performances. My stream froze during Sunak’s closing statement, so I’m delighted to say you will be spared that. I’m not sure he can improve on saying his greatest weakness is he is just too much of a perfectionist anyway ... Well, that brings an end to the ConservativeHome online hustings. The five wannabe PM’s will do it all again tonight at 7.30pm live on Channel 4 if you want another helping of blue-on-blue rhetoric and conjecture. Stick with the politics live blog though, for we will continue to bring you all the latest news from Westminster throughout your Friday afternoon. Updated at 2.43pm BST 2.08pm BST The candidates are now being asked, in true interview style, to identify their greatest weaknesses. Badenoch says she feels she can sometimes let her sense of humour make it seem like she is “flippant” about issues. Sunak says he has a reputation for “working hard and getting across the detail”. He is just too much of a perfectionist, he is basically trying to say here. Classic bad interview response. Truss says she can be “too enthusiastic” about trying to do too much. Mordaunt considers saying Burmese cats (she has four) and that Larry might not be too keen on seeing them in No 10. She ultimately settles on delegating. Tugendhat says he “may possibly talk about the army too much”. 2.03pm BST How would candidates tackle the housing crisis? Now a question on how to solve the housing crisis. Tugendhat starts by attacking Labour saying it would concrete over the whole country, “leaving us with socialist homes owned by the state”. He says his government would provide a 10-year plan for growth, focusing on a stronger, fairer and more resilient economy, with housing a big part of that. He echoes Thatcher’s right-to-buy policy and says he will give people the right to own their own homes. Mordaunt says “there are lots of reasons why we are failing to get the volume of houses built that we need every year but they are different in different places”. She talks about building new towns and the need to focus on brownfield sites. She adds that she has been writing to Sunak for two years about housing issues. Badenoch says as a housing minister, she sees it from a different perspective. The difficulty is supply but it isn’t easy to deliver those homes because it “scares” people who think hundreds of thousands of houses will be built next door to them without the necessary infrastructure. “We have lost a lot of small to medium sized builders,” she adds as a reason why the right properties are not being built. Truss says it is “very, very worrying that people are becoming older and older before they can afford their own home”. She says the government has taken a one-size fits all policy to housing and that the need in different parts of the country varies. She adds: “I also think we need to look at housing together with industry, infrastructure as communities rather than housing estates plonked in the middle of nowhere.” Finally, Sunak says that the government is spending more money to work out how best to “unlock” brownfield sites. He also raises modular housing as a potential solution to be looked at and says the Tories support home ownership and not just keeping people in rented accommodation. Updated at 2.04pm BST 1.50pm BST How will candidates respond to Putin? The candidates are now being asked why they are best placed to stand up to Putin and help Ukraine’s war effort. Mordaunt says: We have to be honest with the British people about how hard this is at it goes on ... Putin has to fail, he cannot gain any territory, he cannot be emboldened in his ambitions at all. There can be no compromise on that. She adds that she has the expertise and that she is able to spot the opportunity in situations, referencing the fall of Afghanistan as a “missed opportunity” by the UK to maintain a presence. Badenoch says: I, more than anyone, understand how important it is the UK is a positive force in the world and is seen to be a positive force in the world. It is critically important that countries around the world know we are there protect those who cannot protect themselves. She adds that she is committed to Nato and that a Ukraine loss in its war with Russia would be “terrible for years to come”. Tugendhat says he has “stood and fought” for Britain for many years and jokes about mentioning his time in the army. He adds: I was in Ukraine earlier this year and have met with many Ukrainian officials and military officers over the past 12 months ... I know what we can do, what we must do. We must force Putin to realise he is going to lose, though it is not for us to define what victory means for the Ukrainians. He goes on to heap praise on the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and says he would increase support to Ukraine and Nato, making sure it is a stronger position by supporting allies such as Latvia and Estonia, and spending more on defence. Sunak starts by saying the UK is “an enormous force for good in the world” and that he takes defence spending “incredibly seriously”. He says he made an exception to ensure the MoD received funding certainty, unlike any other department, during the pandemic. He says: In terms of standing up to Putin, we have to put in place very serious sanctions. Looking forward, defence spending is forecast to rise to 2.5%. I don’t take an approach that relies on arbitrary figures. Truss says: We have led the free world in standing up to Putin and supporting Ukraine in their hour of need. We used our intelligence to expose what [Putin’s] plans were. Now, we need to do more. We need to send more weapons to Ukraine, we need to send more heavy weapons, we need to encourage our international allies to do more. She goes on to say “we need to put more sanctions on Ukraine” - presumably she means Russia, in this case. Truss finishes by saying her view is we need to be spending 3% of GDP on defence by the end of the decade, warning that if Putin succeeds in Ukraine, “he will not stop there”. Updated at 2.44pm BST 1.36pm BST How will candidates address the cost of living crisis? The next question addresses the cost of living crisis and asks candidates how they will help people, in relation to energy and fuel bills, as well as tax. Badenoch says she recognises people are struggling and wants to look at reducing fuel duty. “I also think there are some things we should look at around Universal Credit uplift,” she says. On tax cuts, she says she is in support but won’t be drawn on specifics right now. Tugendhat says the dependence on Russian energy is causing price rises here in the UK. He adds that we need to work closer with our neighbours. “Before we get to Christmas we need a new leader who can restore trust and build back our relationship with homes around the country,” he says. This contest isn’t the right place to set out specific tax cuts, Mordaunt says. However, she has set up “timely and limited” support measures to help with cost of living, such as raising thresholds for lower and middle income earners in line with inflation. She says “there is more we need to do”, such as looking at looking at how bills are structured. Truss says “we immediately need to start putting money back into people’s pockets”. She would reverse the national insurance rise and have a “temporary moratorium” on green energy levies. Strong regulatory reform is required and Britain needs to diverge from the EU on environment and planning regulation to encourage investment to “solve our problems in the longer term”. Sunak says the government “needs to get a grip” of inflation. He reiterates that he will deliver tax cuts but only further down the line, just like Margaret Thatcher did, he says. “On energy, this is the biggest problem everyone is facing ... we need to improve the supply we have,” he adds, but the best way of helping people is moving people off welfare and into well paid jobs. Updated at 1.41pm BST 1.26pm BST How will candidates win back the public's trust? The first question from the public is about how the Tory party plans to win back the trust of the public. Sunak kicks off the responses by saying it “starts with honesty” and says he won’t promise anything he won’t be able to deliver, referencing the tax cuts promised by his fellow leadership hopefuls. He says he can appeal to Tory voters all around the country. The leadership contest should be positive and without mud-slinging, says Mordaunt. She adds: “I agree with have to start delivering for people ... many of our public services are in a desperate state, particularly because of the pandemic. We have a huge catch-up job to do ... we cannot continue with what we’ve been doing because that clearly isn’t work.” Badenoch says the most important thing to do to win trust is keeping promises. She highlights the number of U-turns this government has made and says “no one stands as a dishonest politician but we have to show we are straight with people”. She also says the party needs to move on from calling each other leavers and remainers, adding that it is “the language of inclusivity that matters”. Tugendhat says trust is about demonstrating the government will deliver on its commitments. He says he has campaigned for years across the UK and “that unity is about how we talk to each other”, adding that “the Conservative message of unity ... will be one that we carry across the country.” Liz Truss eventually gives her answer after an awkward moment of being stuck on mute. She says “a forward looking economic agenda” is the vital link between all parts of the country, adding that she has delivered on commitments in every job she has done in government. “I won’t make false claims, I will be honest with people, I will level about the very difficult situations we find ourselves in,” she concluded. Updated at 1.40pm BST 1.17pm BST Bringing up the rear is Rishi Sunak, who is now delivering his opening statement. He says the threat of a weak Labour party, “propped up by the Lib Dems and the SNP is real”. He says: I believe I am the best-placed person to help our party beat Keir Starmer and secure that victory. He says he also has a plan “to build a better future”, adding that tax cuts will come but only after “we have got our house in order”. Sunak says he wants families in the UK to see “tangible changes in their community” and businesses to see the “benefits” of Brexit and for “all of us to feel as if we have turned a corner ... towards growth and hope”. He concludes: We can create a Britain where the most important part about your success is how hard you work and where family is one of the easiest joys, not one of the hardest sacrifices. Updated at 1.25pm BST 1.14pm BST Penny Mordaunt begins her opening statement by saying Whitehall needs to be modernised to “move at the speed business and science needs us to”. She says: We need to be focused on the things that really will help us level up ... we need to deliver excellence in public services and use both the mandate and majority the public have given us. In this contest I have outlined the principles on which I will make decisions about tax ... my focus will be on ensuring all of our citizens can live in safety and security. She says the party needs a return to traditional Conservative politics. 1.12pm BST Now we are hearing from Kemi Badenoch, another of the outside candidates to win this leadership race. She starts off by saying she doesn’t promise things without being able to deliver them. Speaking in front of an oversized Kemi for Prime Minister logo, she says: I only decided to enter this race seven days ago ... Imagine what we could achieve with you, the activists, and this great party behind me. I have a message that is cutting through. She keeps her speech shorter than the rest but says she has what it takes to beat Keir Starmer in a general election. Updated at 1.26pm BST 1.09pm BST Tom Tugendhat up next. He says the Tories need a “clean start” after a collapse of trust in the government. He says: I believe in Britain, I fought for Britain and I’m incredibly proud of our great country so I’m looking forward to making the case ... for many years to come. Restoring trust is the recurring theme of his statement. He says this is the key to defeating Labour and the SNP, adding that the Conservatives are “the natural party of government”. He adds: I am ready to serve, I am ready to lead. You know my record of service, not just in the army but in Westminster. He says he will “restore pride in Britain and in our party” and that looks forward to serving as PM. 1.06pm BST Candidates make their pitches as online hustings begins Liz Truss is giving her opening statement first. She says she went into politics because she wants the UK to be “an aspiration nation that unleashes opportunity across this country”. She says: We can’t just go on with our current [economic] policy. I advocate a major new economic plan ... we need to open up opportunities right across Britain. The leadership hopeful adds that she wants to “make sure we are truly levelling up our country”. She says she can take on the role of PM “from day one” and that she has a “track record of delivering”, claiming during her time as foreign secretary she has stood up to Vladimir Putin and “resolved” the Northern Ireland protocol issue. Updated at 1.46pm BST 1.01pm BST Just a reminder that the ConservativeHome hustings is about to get underway. All five of the remaining hopefuls will be taking part in the debate, hosted by the leading Tory blog. I will keep you updated with all the key questions, answers and everything else in between over the next hour or so. Stay tuned. 12.37pm BST When it comes to the future of the planet, the Tory leadership contest has got off to a dismal start. Rows erupted over the government’s flagship climate policy – the target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 – almost as soon as Boris Johnson sagged back into No 10 after his resignation speech. Several leadership candidates have now cast doubt on the net zero target, vowed to change it in some way, or taken stances against some of the green policies needed to reach it. Yet the target is vital not just for the UK, but for the world at a crucial time. Related: ‘Deeply worrying’: fears for UK’s net zero goal under new Tory leader 12.30pm BST Boris Johnson is working at Chequers on Friday where he plans to stay over the weekend, but Downing Street was unable to say whether he will be joining heatwave discussions. A No 10 spokesman said: Cobra met yesterday and officials from across government will continue to meet regularly both today and throughout the weekend. Asked if the PM is involved, the spokesman said: As always the Prime Minister is kept up to date with all the latest information. Pressed if he will be joining talks from Chequers, the spokesman added: He’s kept thoroughly updated on the latest situation. 12.08pm BST Boris Johnson could be paid more than £1m for his memoir, according to publishing insiders. But anyone expecting a kiss-and-tell may be disappointed, as industry professionals have said he is unlikely to open up about his personal relationships. A publisher, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Guardian that while it was “way too early for anything concrete to happen or be submitted”, they would “be amazed if he doesn’t sign up somewhere for memoirs at some point in the autumn”. Martin Redfern, executive director and literary agent at Northbank Talent, told trade magazine the Bookseller that he thought the book would command “north of £1m”. Related: Boris Johnson memoir could earn him ‘north of £1m’ 11.50am BST MPs on the Commons privileges committee will carry out a site visit in Downing Street, and are demanding No 10 hand over evidence, including WhatsApps, photos and diary entries, as they investigate whether Boris Johnson misled parliament over Partygate. The committee, chaired by Harriet Harman, the longstanding Labour MP, but with a majority of Conservative members, has written to Johnson with a list of evidence they would like to examine. It includes diary entries for eight named dates when events were held; briefing packs for the prime minister’s appearances in parliament between December 2021 and May 2022; and photos for the named dates, including by Johnson’s photographer, Andy Parsons. Harman and her colleagues have also written to the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, asking him to draw the attention of Cabinet Office staff to their call for evidence, and promising to “carry out a site visit”. Related: MPs demand WhatsApps and other Partygate evidence from No 10 11.44am BST Penny Mordaunt also rejected the idea that attacks on her for being too “woke” on issues such as trans rights could be the issue that ends her bid to replace Boris Johnson. She told Sky News this morning: Look at how we’re doing in the polls in the country, in London, in Scotland, with young people, with women, with Red Wall, with Blue Wall. It’s not having an impact on my campaign, and it’s not having an impact on my parliamentary campaign. And I think the reason for that is that people recognise it for what it is. I understand why people are trying to stop me getting into the final two, but I am going to stay focused on the things that matter to the public and the people we’re here to serve. Mordaunt declined to criticise the record of the Johnson administration, but said that “people want us to deliver”, adding: I think it is important we don’t trash our record, because actually we have done an awful lot of good things. 11.28am BST Tory party leadership front-runner Penny Mordaunt has claimed her rivals are trying to stop her but declined to be drawn into criticising other candidates. Speaking to Sky News on Friday morning, she said she was aware that she posed a threat to rivals former chancellor Rishi Sunak and foreign secretary Liz Truss if she made it to the final vote by party members. Mordaunt said it was “understandable” her rivals were trying to stop her but claimed she was best place to defeat Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. She said: I care about my colleagues. I have great colleagues and we have to, at the end of this contest, come together as a party. You can see from my campaign, I’m not engaging in any of that. She also said she was not scared of becoming prime minister, following briefings against her lack of experience as a frontbench government minister. Mordaunt said she had been “beavering away” at her junior ministerial job in recent years, adding: I have just been getting on with my job, but I have thought long and hard about what this country needs. I feel really compelled to do this. It would be a huge honour to be prime minister. 11.01am BST On a sun-drenched common, supporters of Tory leadership candidate Penny Mordaunt, Andrew Wood and Jaspal Chhokar periodically pause as yet another truck from the HS2 rail project rumbles through a constituency that is home to one of Britain’s largest local Conservative parties. While the scheme weighed heavily in the Tories’ byelection loss in neighbouring Chesham and Amersham – raising questions about the party’s so-called blue wall in southern England – the din is also a reminder here in Beaconsfield of the cocktail of factors that fuelled Boris Johnson’s downfall. Although the future of the green belt in one of the most UK’s affluent regions has yet to feature in the race, it’s the sort of issue that could yet prove decisive if and when a final two candidates vie for the votes of members in the party’s heartlands. Related: One thing unites Tories in affluent Beaconsfield: moving on from Johnson 10.33am BST Johnson ordered to hand over Partygate documents to privileges committee Boris Johnson has been ordered to hand over a cache of documents to MPs investigating whether he lied to Parliament with his partygate denials. The Commons Privileges Committee has written to the Prime Minister and cabinet secretary Simon Case demanding details relevant to its inquiry, the Press Association reported. These include Johnson’s diaries for eight days during the lockdown period when parties occurred, email invites, resignation emails and WhatsApp messages and No 10 entry logs. Harriet Harman, the senior MP chairing the investigation, wrote to the pair giving them the deadline of 15 August to hand over the documents. Updated at 10.52am BST 10.12am BST Away from the Tory psychodrama, the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer visited a section of the Berlin wall earlier today while on a trip to the German capital to meet politicians and business leaders. Sir Keir was pictured by the landmark, erected in 1961 by the communist authorities to separate East and West Berlin, the Press Association reported. Sir Keir walked along the East Side Gallery, a section of the wall covered in artwork. The visit came ahead of a meeting between the Labour leader and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The pair are expected to discuss Brexit and mutual economic prosperity between the UK and Germany. He has been joined by the shadow foreign secretary David Lammy on the trip.

Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA 10.08am BST The first televised hustings of the leadership race takes place at 7.30pm tonight live on Channel 4 - but there will be other opportunities to see the candidates for No 10 being grilled on policy and character. It is a somewhat unusual quirk of the British electoral system that millions can watch the debates by our prospective prime ministers but only a relatively minuscule cohort of roughly 200,000 Conservative party members will actually have a say - and even then, only once there are just two candidates left on the ballot. However, my colleague Jamie Grierson has put together a short guide as to where and when the hustings can be watched. First debate – Friday 15 July, 7pm Channel 4 Britain’s Next PM: The Conservative Leadership Debate will air from 7pm to 9.30pm and will be presented by the Channel 4 News anchor Krishnan Guru-Murthy. It can be watched live on Channel 4 or on demand on All 4. Second debate – Sunday 17 July, 7pm, ITV The second debate will air on ITV from 7pm on Sunday 17 July. It can be watched live or on catch-up on ITV Hub. Third debate – Tuesday 19 July, Sky News The third debate, on Sky News, will be hosted by Kay Burley, with questions from a live virtual audience. By this stage more candidates will have been eliminated through further rounds of voting in Westminster. And don’t forget, in addition to the televised debates, we will be bringing you all the latest right here from the ConservativeHome hustings at 1pm. 9.55am BST The Conservative MP Richard Holden, a backer of Rishi Sunak, has this morning told Sky News that it was “total nonsense” to suggest the former chancellor was a “socialist”. Boris Johnson’s remaining loyalists in the Conservative Party have increased their attacks on Sunak in recent days, accusing him of presiding over tax hikes, the Press Association reported. Holden also rejected the suggestion that Sunak’s wealth made him unrelatable. He told Sky News that the furlough scheme, introduced at the start of the pandemic, proved that Sunak had a “track record” of helping ordinary voters, adding: Whether it’s Rishi Sunak, who’s wealthier than many of my constituents or Keir Starmer, who is far wealthier than many of my constituents could ever dream to be either, what people I think are really interested in is who’s best for them and who’s going run the country. Holden also rejected that there were any questions about Sunak’s integrity, amid accusations he had stabbed Johnson in the back. He said: He’s been very upfront throughout this entire situation. He’s backed the prime minister all the ways through the last couple of years, through some really difficult decisions over Covid. Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak walks in London, Britain, July 15, 2022. Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters 9.50am BST Tory MP Jake Berry has said it will be a “key weekend” for Tom Tugendhat as live debates begin in the Conservative Party leadership contest. He said it has been an “extraordinary performance” for Tugendhat to get this far. However, his candidate failed to gain much additional support in the second round of voting on Thursday, leading some bookmakers to push his odds of winning the contest out as long as 150/1. Berry told Sky News: He has had so much support from across the party, and wider, in terms of being able to get into this phase and to set out his case. It is all up in the air. He added that it is up to the other candidates to prove they have fresh ideas for the party.

Photograph: Yui Mok/PA 9.41am BST Former minister urges Kemi Badenoch to pull out and support Truss bid Meanwhile, the former Brexit minister David Frost has this morning urged Kemi Badenoch to pull out of the Tory leadership contest to bolster Liz Truss’s position in the race. Lord Frost also stepped up his attacks on the second-placed candidate Penny Mordaunt, saying she was “absent on parade” when he worked with her on post-Brexit negotiations last year. Truss was picking up support from the Tory right after the attorney general, Suella Braverman, was eliminated from an increasingly bitter leadership race in which the former chancellor Rishi Sunak came out top and Mordaunt second in the latest round of MPs’ votes. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Frost said: Kemi and Suella Braverman set out convincing programmes, with differing emphases, for change. But Liz’s depth of experience, her energy and ideas – as well as the simple fact she has the most votes of the three – put her in the lead. It is now time for pragmatism. I urge Kemi to stand down in return for a serious job in a Truss administration. For more on this developing story, see my colleague Jamie Grierson’s piece below. Related: David Frost urges Kemi Badenoch to step aside for Liz Truss The intervention came as the Tory MP Justin Tomlinson denied Badenoch should be judged for a lack of experience. He told Times Radio: The most important part of experience is pure ability, and I didn’t know Kemi personally before I supported her campaign, but I’ve seen her first-hand - select committees, despatch box, inter-ministerial meetings - and she really stood head and shoulders above many of our very talented colleagues. She has had two years’ more experience than both David Cameron and Tony Blair, who both went and did very well in elections. And, ultimately, this all comes down to elections. We’re facing an unprecedented fifth term, and to do that we need a fresh start, where we’ve fully renewed. Nobody offers a better chance, particularly for my Red Wall and Blue Wall colleagues, to make sure they are re-elected. Updated at 9.55am BST 9.41am BST Good morning, I’m Tom Ambrose and welcome to the UK politics live blog on what is already a very warm Friday here in London. With the Tory leadership race narrowed down to five candidates, I will be bringing you all the latest news and opinions from across Westminster as we head into the weekend. There is a hustings hosted by the ConservativeHome website due to take place at 1pm - we will aim to bring you updates from that - followed by another taking place live on Channel 4 at 7.30pm. However, the main focus so far the day, as the remaining candidate’s supporters hit the airwaves and television studios, is the accusation of a smear campaign against the surprise front-runner Penny Mordaunt. Transport minister Wendy Morton denied that the team behind Liz Truss’s leadership bid is involved in a so-called “black ops” campaign against her rival. Morton, appearing on Times Radio, said she is “absolutely not” involved in any kind of untoward campaign. She said: What I am involved in is a campaign to get Liz Truss elected as the next leader of the Conservative Party because I happen to think, I know, that she’s the right candidate. I worked with her at the Foreign Office and I saw first-hand how hard-working she is, how dedicated she is, and how she just gets on with the job and she delivers. She said the Truss camp is not concerned about the lead Mordaunt has maintained against the Foreign Secretary, adding: You know, we have still got rounds of voting to go, there are still candidates, there are colleagues out there who have not declared for a candidate, there are colleagues who have voted for candidates who have now dropped out of the race. So it’s all to play for. It came as Tory MP Dame Maria Miller, pressed on whether Mordaunt could fall victim to dirty tactics as she seeks to replace Boris Johnson, said her candidate wanted a positive campaign. She told Sky News: Penny’s support among Members of Parliament has grown, and that is the same throughout the country. This leadership contest is run along a set of lines and I think people will want it to be a positive campaign. We’re colleagues, together, we’re not opposing each other in a fundamental political sense. It is just about getting a new leader.

Unfortunately, when the Ai-Da robot arrived at the Palace of Westminster on Tuesday, the opposite seemed to occur. Apparently overcome by the stuffy atmosphere, the machine, which resembles a sex doll strapped to a pair of egg whisks, shut down halfway through the evidence session. As its creator, Aidan Meller, scrabbled with power sockets to restart the device, he put a pair of sunglasses on the machine. “When we reset her, she can sometimes pull quite interesting faces,” he explained. The headlines that followed were unlikely to be what the Lords communications committee had hoped for when inviting Meller and his creation to give evidence as part of an inquiry into the future of the UK’s creative economy. But Ai-Da is part of a long line of humanoid robots who have dominated the conversation around artificial intelligence by looking the part, even if the tech that underpins them is far from cutting edge. “The committee members and the roboticist seem to know that they are all part of a deception,” said Jack Stilgoe, a University College London academic who researches the governance of emerging technologies. “This was an evidence hearing, and all that we learned is that some people really like puppets. There was little intelligence on display – artificial or otherwise. “If we want to learn about robots, we need to get behind the curtain, we should hear from roboticists, not robots. We need to get roboticists and computer scientists to help us understand what computers can’t do rather than being wowed by their pretences. “There are genuinely important questions about AI and art – who really benefits? Who owns creativity? How can the providers of AI’s raw material – like Dall-E’s dataset of millions of previous artists – get the credit they deserve? Ai-Da clouds rather than helps this discussion.” Stilgoe was not alone in bemoaning the missed opportunity. “I can only imagine Ai-Da has several purposes and many of them may be good ones,” said Sami Kaski, a professor of AI at the University of Manchester. “The unfortunate problem seems to be that the public stunt failed this time and gave the wrong impression. And if the expectations were really high, then whoever sees the demo can generalise that ‘oh, this field doesn’t work, this technology in general doesn’t work’.” In response, Meller told the Guardian that Ai-Da “is not a deception, but a reflector of our own current human endeavours to decode and mimic the human condition. The artwork encourages us to reflect critically on these societal trends, and their ethical implications. “Ai-Da is Duchampian, and is part of a discussion in contemporary art and follows in the footsteps of Andy Warhol, Nam June Paik, Lynn Hershman Leeson, all of whom have explored the humanoid in their art. Ai-Da can be considered within the dada tradition, which challenged the notion of ‘art’. Ai-Da in turn challenges the notion of ‘artist’. While good contemporary art can be controversial it is our overall goal that a wide-ranging and considered conversation is stimulated.” As the peers in the Lords committee heard just before Ai-Da arrived on the scene, AI technology is already having a substantial input on the UK’s creative industries – just not in the form of humanoid robots. “There has been a very clear advance particularly in the last couple of years,” said Andres Guadamuz, an academic at the University of Sussex. “Things that were not possible seven years ago, the capacity of the artificial intelligence is at a different level entirely. Even in the last six months, things are changing, and particularly in the creative industries.” Guadamuz appeared alongside representatives from Equity, the performers’ union, and the Publishers Association, as all three discussed ways that recent breakthroughs in AI capability were having real effects on the ground. Equity’s Paul Fleming, for instance, raised the prospect of synthetic performances, where AI is already “directly impacting” the condition of actors. “For instance, why do you need to engage several artists to put together all the movements that go into a video game if you can wantonly data mine? And the opting out of it is highly complex, particularly for an individual.” If an AI can simply watch every performance from a given actor and create character models that move like them, that actor may never work again. The same risks apply for other creative industries, said Dan Conway from the Publishers Association, and the UK government is making them worse. “There is a research exception in UK law … and at the moment, the legal provision would allow any of those businesses of any size located anywhere in the world to access all of my members’ data for free for the purposes of text and data mining. There is no differentiation between a large US tech firm in the US and a AI micro startup in the north of England.” The technologist Andy Baio has called the process “AI data laundering” and it is how a company such as Meta can train its video-creation AI using 10m video clips scraped for free from a stock photo site. The Lords inquiry into the future of the creative economy will continue. No more robots, physical or otherwise, are scheduled to give evidence.","Id":"technology/2022/oct/14/ai-da-robot-sums-up-flawed-logic-lords-debate-ai","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webTitle":"Ai-Da the robot sums up the flawed logic of Lords debate on AI","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/14/ai-da-robot-sums-up-flawed-logic-lords-debate-ai","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2022/oct/14/ai-da-robot-sums-up-flawed-logic-lords-debate-ai","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":903,"webPublicationDate":"2022-10-14T16:05:33Z","hosted":false,"id":"technology/2022/oct/14/ai-da-robot-sums-up-flawed-logic-lords-debate-ai"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Is No 10 waking up to dangers of artificial intelligence?","body":"James Phillips is a weirdo and a misfit. At least, he was one of those who responded to a request by Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s former chief of staff, for exactly such people to work in No 10. Phillips worked as a technology adviser in Downing Street for two and a half years, during which time he became increasingly concerned that ministers were not paying enough attention to the risks posed by the fast-moving world of artificial intelligence. “We are still not talking enough about how dangerous these things could be,” says Phillips, who left government last year when Johnson quit. “The level of concern in government has not yet reached the level of concern that exists in private within the industry.” That may be changing, however. The last few months have seen a shift in tone from senior ministers about the balance of risks and rewards posed by the AI industry. At last month’s budget, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, talked about the UK winning the global AI race, insisting the UK would not erect “protectionist barriers for all our critical industries”. But by the end of the G7 meeting in Japan last week, Rishi Sunak had a very different emphasis. “If it’s used securely, obviously there are benefits from artificial intelligence for growing our economy, for transforming our society, improving public services,” he told reporters on the aeroplane back to London. “But that has to be done safely and securely and with guardrails in place.” No 10 would not say what had sparked the prime minister’s change in tone. But a series of events, from the development of ChatGPT, to recent warnings by the “godfather of AI” Geoffrey Hinton, to discussion at the G7 itself, seem to have shifted the debate among ministers and the public. Related: Rishi Sunak races to tighten rules for AI amid fears of existential risk “The world needs to move faster; the UK needs to move faster,” says Shabbir Merali, a former adviser to Liz Truss who is now a policy fellow at the centre-right thinktank Onward. “If we don’t, there is a risk that something awful happens and the whole thing explodes.” Experts warn there are short-term risks, for example that students use it to cheat in exams, that election candidates use it for misinformation, or that companies use it to make discriminatory hiring decisions without even realising they are doing so. The technology could also simply get it wrong: last year a student was stabbed in a New York school even though the school used AI-powered weapons detection. Then there is the big long-term worry: what if AI becomes sentient? Regulating such a fast-moving industry is likely to prove difficult, but certain principles can be enacted. Companies using large datasets to train their AI tools could be forced to share information with governmental agencies, for example. They could also be made to hire “red teams” of outside experts to pretend to be malicious actors to simulate how the technology could be misused. People who are working on particularly sensitive technology could be required to sign agreements that they will not release it to particular groups or governments. There is also a question of liability. Ministers may soon have to decide who should be responsible should something go wrong with a particular product: the user or the developer? None of this works solely on a national level, however, given that developers can easily set up anywhere in the world. Government insiders say Sunak is particularly keen to explore what role the UK can play in formulating an international set of guidelines to update the current ones drawn up by Unesco in 2021. They would not say however whether he backs the idea by Sam Altman, the CEO of ChatGPT’s founder company OpenAI, to create an international agency along the lines of the International Atomic Energy Agency. In the immediate term, No 10 says it has no plans to increase resources to existing regulators for monitoring AI. Labour research suggests such a move might be needed though: in a recent parliamentary answer, the technology minister Paul Scully was not even able to say how many staff across the UK’s various watchdogs work wholly or partly on AI. Many believe the existing regulatory framework will quickly prove outdated, however. Phillips has called on the government to develop its own AI research and development arm to understand the industry better. “You need people who fundamentally and deeply understand the tech, and the only way to do that is with people who have built it themselves,” he says. But he also warns: “We are constantly chasing the game now, because nothing has been done for the last three to four years.”","Id":"technology/2023/may/26/no-10-waking-up-dangers-artificial-intelligence","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webTitle":"Is No 10 waking up to dangers of artificial intelligence?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/26/no-10-waking-up-dangers-artificial-intelligence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/may/26/no-10-waking-up-dangers-artificial-intelligence","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":772,"webPublicationDate":"2023-05-26T15:00:37Z","hosted":false,"id":"technology/2023/may/26/no-10-waking-up-dangers-artificial-intelligence"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Truss and Sunak trade blows in acrimonious first TV debate","body":"The battle to become the UK’s next prime minister descended into fierce clashes on Monday night as Rishi Sunak launched repeated attacks on the economic policies of the favourite Liz Truss in their first head-to-head TV debate. The two Conservative leadership hopefuls traded blows over tax cuts, China and inflation, with the former chancellor Sunak accusing the foreign secretary of seeking “a short-term sugar rush” by cutting national insurance. Truss accused her former cabinet colleague of raising taxes to their highest level for 70 years. The exchanges at the BBC debate followed a weekend of deeply personal attacks – with Sunak criticised over his wealth and wardrobe, as Truss faced claims she was economically illiterate while being reminded that she was formerly a remainer. Sunak, widely seen as having to make up crucial ground to win over the Conservative membership, who will vote from 5 August, repeatedly described his opponent’s plans on the economy as “not conservative”, interrupting her at one point to say: “You promised almost £40bn of unfunded tax cuts, £40bn more borrowing. “That is the country’s credit card. It’s our children and grandchildren … everyone here … who are going to have to pick up the tab for that.” Truss hit back over Sunak’s calls for a tougher stance on China, pointing out that the Treasury just last month was calling for closer bilateral and economic ties. Sunak accused his opponent of making pronouncements about a “golden era” between China and the UK. “I think that was almost a decade ago,” the foreign secretary snapped back. Amid reports that Boris Johnson has not yet ruled out a political comeback, despite pledging to step down next month, both candidates also ruled out a role for the current PM in any government they might lead. “I am sure he will have a role. I am sure he will be vocal, but he will not be part of the government,” said the foreign secretary, despite emphasising that she had been an early supporter of Johnson’s. She contrasted her continuing loyalty to him to those of others, adding that “it would have been a dereliction of duty” not to remain in her post. According to the Daily Telegraph, Johnson told Lord Cruddas at Chequers over lunch on Friday that he “wants to fight the next general election as leader of the Conservative party”, the peer said. Related: Liz Truss pledges crackdown on unions but is accused of ‘Tory fantasy’ Cruddas is running a campaign to give Conservative party members a vote on whether to accept Johnson’s resignation as Tory leader. But Downing Street responded by insisting Johnson will leave the post when a new leader is chosen. On Johnson, Truss told the debate: “Having spent time with him this week on foreign affairs, I very very much suspect he would not want a future role in the government. He needs a well-earned break.” Sunak, whose resignation from cabinet on the same day as Sajid Javid precipitated the ousting of Johnson, paid tribute to Johnson as “remarkable” but said he had reached a point where “enough was enough”. “I thought all the things that were going on on the conduct side were not right … and we clearly had different views on the economy side,” he said. But with postal ballots set to arrive on Tory members’ doorsteps by 5 August, Sunak faced pressure to use the BBC debate – and another hosted by TalkTV and the Sun on Tuesday – to make an early breakthrough. Although he comfortably won the leadership race among Tory MPs, Truss is the favourite to win after a series of opinion polls and surveys put her firmly ahead with party members. Perhaps as a result of this pressure on Sunak, the debate was particularly bad-tempered, with the former chancellor often interrupting Truss. At one point, she said: “Under my plans, we would start paying back the debt in three years’ time, so I’m not putting it on the never never.” The former chancellor interrupted, saying, “That’s simply not right”, adding: “You promised almost £40bn of unfunded tax cuts … that is the country’s credit card.” Truss said: “Rishi, that is not true. Under my plans, we would start paying down the debts in three years’ time. Covid was a one-in-100-years event. No other country is putting up taxes at this moment. The OECD has described Rishi’s policies as contractionary.” In the aftermath of the debate, supporters of Truss argued that Sunak’s interruptions were a result of his entitled background. “He came across like a public school mansplainer,” said one. One Sunak supporter claimed that Truss did not understand the economy. “She was once again out of her depth,” the MP said. Party grandees spoke out in the hours before the debate, pleading for both parties to resist from “trashing the brand”. But the tensions that have been building continued to manifest themselves, with Truss declining to distance herself from comments by a supporter, the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, who outraged some fellow Tory MPs by comparing Sunak’s bespoke suit and Prada shoes to Truss’s £4.50 earrings from Claire’s Accessories. “I am not going to give Rishi fashion advice. I mean, I have said he is a very well-dressed man. I’m not going to give him fashion advice,” said Truss, when challenged about Dorries’ comments. Related: First Truss-Sunak Tory leadership debate: five key takeaways Lord Maude, the former party chair and minister for the Cabinet Office, had told the BBC’s PM programme ahead of the debate: “One is obviously going to win the leadership, but if the behaviour of the teams and their language has been uncontrolled, and it has damaged the party’s standing or the way people see the party, then it could end up being a pyrrhic victory.” He said that the increasingly fractious tone of interventions from the campaign teams over the weekend had begun to appear like “a race over who can sound more rightwing, as if that’s the only game in town”. Allies of Sunak said it was “no secret” that he had to make a significant impression in the debate, with polls suggesting he is trailing his rival. But one campaign source said the polling from both YouGov and ConservativeHome showed a wider gulf between the candidates than they had detected and said many members were undecided. Truss has strictly limited her broadcast appearances and has thus far declined to be interviewed by veteran political journalist Andrew Neil, who will go head-to-head with Sunak on Friday. Channel 4 said it was still hoping to convince Truss to take part. Allies of Sunak have suggested he will take numerous broadcast opportunities in order to highlight one of his own strengths versus Truss’s perceived weakness. In previous multi-candidate debates, Truss has polled badly with the general public, whereas Sunak came top in one debate and second in another. Earlier on Monday, Sunak teased his rival with a tweet – “Just me then?” – and a wink as Channel 4 announced the interview with Neil. Truss’s refusal echoes that of Boris Johnson, who refused to be interviewed by Neil during the 2019 general election campaign. Sunak and Truss will take part in another head-to-head debate on TalkTV on Tuesday night, and face off again at the first of the members’ hustings in Leeds on Thursday night. Truss is likely to come under scrutiny when she returns to her home city on Thursday after multiple speeches criticising her former comprehensive school in north Leeds, which she said spent “too little time spent making sure everyone could read and write … there was a preference for symbolic gestures”. The remarks have been criticised by the former Conservative MP for the area and by city councillors.","Id":"politics/2022/jul/25/truss-sunak-trade-blows-tv-debate-tory-leadership","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Truss and Sunak trade blows in acrimonious first TV debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/25/truss-sunak-trade-blows-tv-debate-tory-leadership","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/25/truss-sunak-trade-blows-tv-debate-tory-leadership","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":1262,"webPublicationDate":"2022-07-25T21:45:35Z","hosted":false,"id":"politics/2022/jul/25/truss-sunak-trade-blows-tv-debate-tory-leadership"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"As scandal-hit CBI faces a members’ exodus, do we need a replacement?","body":"If one big company quits, there’ll be an avalanche. So said one senior business figure at the start of this week about the crisis engulfing the CBI. The prediction was accurate. Aviva, a big insurer, was first to resign from the lobby group on Friday morning. Phoenix, a fellow FTSE 100 insurer, quickly followed. By mid-afternoon, it was hard to keep up. Not all stances took the form of a straightforward Aviva-style resignation “with immediate effect”. Some involved a “suspension” or “pausing” of activities with the CBI, leaving the door open for a return. Even within the latter category, however, one could detect weakening loyalty. The big four auditing firm PwC said it saw value in an organisation that represented UK business, and the issues that mattered most to business as a whole – but did not say specifically that the organisation had to be the CBI. That points to a debate that has been bubbling in the background over the past fortnight. If the CBI did not exist, would it be necessary to create something that performed its role? And, given the deepening crisis, would it be better to get on with the job of reinvention or replacement now? The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) is the UK’s most prominent business lobbying organisation. It is a not-for-profit organisation founded by royal charter in 1965, after a merger of older employer bodies. It claims “unrivalled” access to government. It also claims to have the biggest number of policy specialists outside of Whitehall, the seat of the British government, in order to support its 190,000 business members, which are the chief source of its income. Its total income was £25m in 2021, of which £22m was from membership fees. Its membership is composed of direct members and members of other trade bodies. Its 1,500 direct members are businesses that actively hold membership. Fees vary significantly: top-tier businesses can pay £90,000 annually, some mid-sized companies pay half this price and smaller companies pay far less. The bulk of its membership comes via trade bodies, and it counts these memberships within its own 190,000 total. The lobby group has access to the prime minister and cabinet, and campaigns on issues ranging from funding for childcare to tax and skills. Its relationship with the UK government was stretched severely by Brexit, with its access to No 10 much curtailed. A remark attributed to the former prime minister Boris Johnson – “fuck business” – was considered to be aimed at efforts by the CBI and others to try to influence the post-Brexit UK-EU trade agreement. The organisation sought to rebuild ties with the government during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, including working alongside trade unions and No 10 on developing the furlough scheme. The CBI is governed by a president and an executive committee, which, in normal times, is chaired by the director general. It also has a board of non-executive directors, which the director general sits on. Anna Isaac The majority view in big boardrooms is probably still that, yes, a pan-business lobbying body is useful. The CBI, having opposed Brexit, has had a prickly relationship with the current government, but there were signs of effectiveness before ministers suspended engagement after the Guardian’s reporting. In March, two of the CBI’s main requests – on childcare provision and capital allowances to boost investment – were embraced by the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, in his budget. Other lobbying areas that are seen as covering all companies – large and small, domestic and international – would include tax, employment law, environmental policies and the levelling up agenda. The CBI is also a far bigger organisation than the Institute of Directors, the other business body with a royal charter. Yet others are less enthused. The chairs of some large FTSE 100 companies often say they already have access to government in their own right, and suggest they pay for CBI membership only out of loose responsibility to the wider UK business scene. Some see their industry trade organisations as more relevant. And some argue that the CBI, with its heavy membership skew towards banks and the City of London, is compromised and ineffectual when the interests of financiers and the rest of the economy collide – such as when the lack of bank lending was a burning issue after the crisis of 2007-09. Here’s the blunt assessment of one senior corporate affairs veteran: “The government has nothing to lose if it never speaks to the CBI ever again. And the CBI leadership is deluding itself if it thinks its members are going to rise in support of an organisation whose handling of these allegations has been cack-handed.” On Friday evening, the CBI board met and suspended day-to-day operations until June, when it will hold a meeting to decide on its future. After the public exodus of many leading members, the move was probably inevitable. The open question is whether the CBI ever returns in recognisable form. Its survival is on the line.","Id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/apr/21/cbi-members-quit-aviva-lobby-group","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webTitle":"As scandal-hit CBI faces a members’ exodus, do we need a replacement?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/apr/21/cbi-members-quit-aviva-lobby-group","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/apr/21/cbi-members-quit-aviva-lobby-group","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":532,"webPublicationDate":"2023-04-21T17:35:59Z","hosted":false,"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/apr/21/cbi-members-quit-aviva-lobby-group"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Herschel Walker denies abortion ban support and brandishes ‘police badge’ in Georgia debate","body":"The Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker, a staunch anti-abortion politician accused by a former girlfriend of encouraging and paying for her abortion in 2009, used his only debate against the Democratic senator Raphael Warnock on Friday to deny his previous support for an outright national abortion ban. Related: Woman tells New York Times that Herschel Walker urged her to have second abortion The former college football and NFL star, who is endorsed by Donald Trump, was asked about his support for “a complete ban on a national level”. He said the moderator misstated his position. That contradicted statements made repeatedly on the campaign trail, including in July when Walker said it was “a problem” that no national ban existed. Walker also answered an attack from Warnock about his past claims about being a law enforcement officer by producing what he said was a police badge. Warnock said: “You can support police officers as I’ve done … while at the same time holding police officers, like all professions, accountable. One thing I have not done, I’ve never pretended to be a police officer. And I’ve never, I’ve never threatened a shootout with the police.” Saying “I have to respond to that”, Walker produced his badge. Walker has never been a trained law enforcement officer, though he has law enforcement endorsements. As Walker brandished his badge, the debate moderator said: “Mr Walker, Mr Walker – excuse me, Mr Walker. I need to let you know, Mr Walker, you are very well aware of the rules tonight. And you have a prop that is not allowed. Sir, I asked you to put that prop away.” Walker did not do so immediately. The moderator said: “Excuse me, sir. You’re very well aware of the rules, aren’t you?” Walker said: “Well, let’s talk about the truth.” Walker’s apparent battle with the truth over abortion has become a theme of the midterm elections. On Friday, he said his position was the same as Georgia’s state law, a so-called heartbeat bill that bans abortion at six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. That law went into effect this year after the US supreme court overturned the right to abortion. The heated exchange on abortion was one of many that highlighted stark differences between Warnock and Walker. Warnock did not directly bring up the allegation about Walker paying for an abortion, leaving moderators to elicit a flat denial. Walker blasted Warnock for being a Baptist pastor who supports abortion rights. “Instead of aborting those babies, why aren’t you baptizing those babies?” he said. Warnock said “God gave us a choice and I respect the right of women to make a decision”, adding that Walker “wants to arrogate more power to politicians than God has”. Warnock and his fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff won their Senate seats in a January 2021 special election, two months after Joe Biden beat Trump in Georgia by fewer than 12,000 votes. It was the first time in two decades Democrats won federal elections in the state, raising questions about whether Warnock can win again as Biden’s popularity falls. In-person voting begins on Monday. The outcome will help determine control of the Senate, currently split 50-50. Related: Republicans throw support behind Herschel Walker after abortion denial Onstage, Walker claimed Warnock was a Biden puppet, saying the election was about what they “had done to you and your family” in an inflationary economy. Warnock said the election was about “who is ready to represent Georgia”. Walker blamed Warnock and Biden for inflation but offered little when asked what he would do to fix it. Walker said the first step was “getting back” to energy independence rather than depending “on our enemies”. The US had never been free from fossil fuel imports, some from countries such as Russia. Warnock highlighted Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, focusing on provisions he sponsored capping insulin and other healthcare costs, the extension of the child tax credit and infrastructure provisions he shepherded with Republicans. He offered few specifics about further steps. Warnock declined to say if Biden, nearing 80, should seek re-election in 2024. Walker deviated from Trump by saying Biden won legitimately in 2020. But he said he would support Trump if he ran in 2024. Both Walker and Warnock said they would accept the outcome of their election. Both men discussed their personal lives. Recent reporting by the Daily Beast disclosed records of an abortion receipt and personal check from Walker to a woman who said he paid for her abortion. Walker’s denials have continued even after the woman identified herself as the mother of one of his four children. Walker acknowledged three children publicly for the first time only after Beast reporting. Other reports have detailed how Walker has exaggerated academic achievements, business success and philanthropic activities, as well as accusations he threatened the life of his ex-wife beyond details acknowledged in a 2008 memoir. In perhaps his most effective debate move, Warnock alluded to such stories. “We will see time and time again tonight, as we’ve always seen, that my opponent has a problem with the truth,” said Warnock. Dismissing reports that a foundation tied to Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he is senior pastor, had evicted tenants from real-estate holdings, Warnock said Walker was trying to “sully the name of Martin Luther King’s church”. Walker pointed to his memoir, in which he detailed a diagnosis of dissociative personality disorder. Walker said he had “been transparent” and “continue[d] to get help if I need help, but I don’t need any help. I’m doing well. I’m ready to lead today.” Walker declined three debates typical in Georgia campaigns. The Savannah debate did not include the libertarian Chase Oliver, who did not meet a polling threshold. Warnock will meet Oliver in a Sunday debate sponsored by the Atlanta Press Club. Walker will be represented by an empty podium.","Id":"us-news/2022/oct/15/us-midterm-elections-herschel-walker-abortion-ban-police-badge-georgia-senate-debate-warnock","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"Herschel Walker denies abortion ban support and brandishes ‘police badge’ in Georgia debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/15/us-midterm-elections-herschel-walker-abortion-ban-police-badge-georgia-senate-debate-warnock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/oct/15/us-midterm-elections-herschel-walker-abortion-ban-police-badge-georgia-senate-debate-warnock","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":953,"webPublicationDate":"2022-10-15T03:27:44Z","hosted":false,"id":"us-news/2022/oct/15/us-midterm-elections-herschel-walker-abortion-ban-police-badge-georgia-senate-debate-warnock"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"We need serious public policy, not more printed money – the US economy is in tatters","body":"With the Federal Reserve leading the world’s central banks in a tightening cycle of interest rate rises, the likes of which we haven’t seen since 2006, commentators across the political spectrum are noting the fondness of the Fed chair, Jerome “Jay” Powell, for his legendary predecessor, Paul Volcker. On the left, the comparison is fearful; on the center and on the right, it’s one of admiration. But circumstances don’t really support the comparison. Related: Fed announces sixth consecutive hike in US interest rates to fight inflation On taking office in October 1979, Volcker declared “the standard of living of the average American has to decline” as a consequence of the war against the chronic inflation of the 1970s. He quickly set to work making that happen by driving interest rates up towards 20% and creating the deepest US recession since the 1930s. That squeeze did put an end to high inflation but at a tremendous social cost. Six million people lost their jobs over the next three years, taking the unemployment rate from 6% to almost 11% in late 1982. The cost wasn’t merely short-term. About half of those job losses were categorized as permanent, as opposed to being temporary layoffs, many of them in the manufacturing heartland. The term “rust belt” entered common usage. Volcker was appointed by Jimmy Carter, who seemed to have no idea of what he was getting himself into. His friend and adviser, the Georgia banker Bert Lance, prophetically warned him that he was dooming his prospects in the 1980s election. But Carter listened to the consensus of Wall Street and the political class – Volcker was the man to tame inflation, which was running around 13% at the end of 1979. The US had seen inflation rates that high before, but never outside of major wars or their immediate aftermath. Inflation, which was under 2% in 1965, had been rising relentlessly for 15 years, barely pausing even in the nasty recession of the mid-1970s. Contrary to a belief popular on the left, that inflation was not kind to workers. Wages badly lagged prices, and real average hourly earnings fell 14% between 1973 and 1980. A decade of cheap money papered over a lot of fundamental problems with the US economy There are some similarities between the present and 40 years ago. Then, as now, food and energy prices were important factors in sparking inflation, but in both cases, even if you strip out those two volatile components, a severe inflation remains. And in both cases, polls have shown inflation to be deeply unpopular. But there are also major differences, notably in the strength of labor. At the end of the 1970s, almost a quarter of all workers were unionized; now only about a tenth are. Then, an average of 22,000 workdays were lost to strikes every year; last year it was just 1,500 – a decline of 93%. The early 1980s recession hammered the bargaining power of the working class. Unions were busted, and we went from a time when Take This Job and Shove It could be a hit song (as it was in 1977) to one where workers were grateful to have any job at all, no matter how tenuous and low-paying. As the recession ended in late 1982, the stock market took off and the employer class began a 40-year celebration of its triumph. That’s not the world Powell finds himself in. Inflation has been a problem for close to 15 months rather than 15 years, and although there are some tentative signs of life in the labor movement – notably at one Amazon site and a few hundred Starbucks outlets (out of 9,000) – the share of the labor force represented by unions fell last year, and strike activity so far in 2022 is about a third lower than in 2021. Unlike the inflation of the 1970s, this is not the wage-push kind (to use the jargon). It’s been driven first by supply chain blockages, thanks to Covid, and extended by embargoes against Russian energy exports, and most workers are just looking on helplessly as their paychecks fail to keep up with price increases. Most workers are just looking by helplessly as their paychecks fail to keep up with price increases There’s another difference as well: we’re coming off a decade of extremely indulgent monetary policy. Coming out of the Great Recession, the Fed kept short-term interest rates near zero between 2011 and 2021, with the brief exception when they pushed them up to just over 2% in 2017 and 2018 (still quite low by historical standards). On top of that, the central bank pumped over $3tn (£2.7tn) into the financial markets between 2008 and 2015, and almost $5tn between early 2020 and early 2022. The earlier pumping was meant to prevent a financial implosion after the sub-prime crisis, and the latter to counter the threats of the early pandemic months. But the result of both has been to stimulate crazy inflation in asset prices – stocks, crypto, unicorns, housing – a remarkable waste of capital and one that can be very risky to deflate. Decades of bailouts have convinced financial market players that the Fed will always come in to rescue them and reversing that mentality could require a Volckerish austerity for Wall Street – one that’s politically hard to imagine. Related: The Fed’s interest rate hikes are going to hit the most vulnerable | Dean Baker What Powell is up to now bears almost no resemblance to Volcker’s clampdown. The federal funds rate, the interest rate at which banks lend each other money overnight – that is the Fed’s most direct policy target – changed from just above 0% to just under 4% after raising the target rate another 0.75 points this week. That’s almost 15 points below the Volcker peak. In real terms – deducting the rate of inflation – Volcker’s peak was almost 10%, a lot higher. Right now, the real fed funds rate is around -4% (yes, that’s a negative sign). Powell may admire Volcker, but next to him, he’s a piker. The debate over monetary policy overlooks a more important issue. That decade of cheap money papered over a lot of fundamental problems with the US economy: low levels of public and private investment, massive polarization between rich and poor and unstable employment for much of the labor force. These should be addressed with serious public policy, not by printing money. It would be nice if we talked about that, but given the degraded state of American political discourse, I’m not hopeful.

As the contenders clashed repeatedly over tax and spending in the ITV debate, Liz Truss confronted her former cabinet colleague, saying: “Rishi, you have raised taxes to the highest level in 70 years. That is not going to drive economic growth. “The fact is that raising taxes at this moment will choke off economic growth,” she added. Truss has promised tax cuts worth as much as £30bn, suggesting they can be paid for through additional borrowing and faster growth. Sunak insisted there would be a cost to immediate tax cuts, however, in “higher inflation, higher mortgage rates, eroded savings”. “And you know what, this something-for-nothing economics is not conservative, it’s socialism,” he said. “If we’re not for sound money, what is the point of the Conservative party?” The hard-fought leadership contest, triggered by the reluctant resignation of Boris Johnson as Tory leader 10 days ago, has pitted current and former cabinet colleagues against one other. Truss, who has the backing of Johnson loyalists including Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nadine Dorries, has defined herself in particular against Sunak, who led in both the first two rounds of voting among MPs. He has staunchly defended his record as chancellor, however – including the decision to raise national insurance contributions. As well as questioning colleagues’ tax cut plans, Sunak also took on Penny Mordaunt’s suggestion earlier on Sunday that she could ditch one of his fiscal rules – the promise only to borrow for investment, not day-to-day spending – to allow the Treasury to spend more on tackling the cost of living. Challenged about it, Mordaunt said: “Too many chancellors have had too many fiscal rules that they have then had to ditch because they weren’t able to meet them,” prompting Sunak to shoot back: “Literally Jeremy Corbyn didn’t think that was the right approach.” Taxes and the economy have been at the heart of the contest, with Sunak the only candidate not promising immediate tax cuts, promising instead not to tell “fairy tales” about what is affordable. With each candidate given the opportunity to question one of their colleagues, three of Sunak’s four rivals turned on him. Kemi Badenoch asked him why he had failed to take more action on Covid loan fraud, despite the fact that she and other ministers had raised the issue with him during the pandemic. He said: “That’s absolutely not right”, stressing the speed with which the scheme had had to be rolled out. Truss asked Sunak about whether he still favoured investment in China, and Mordaunt questioned whether he had done enough as chancellor to fund defence spending. Sunak turned on Truss, asking her: “You’ve been both a Liberal Democrat and a remainer: I’m just wondering which one of those you regretted most?” The foreign secretary said she wasn’t born in a Conservative home, and had been on a political “journey”. She also returned to the familiar theme of her Leeds comprehensive school, where she claims fellow pupils were let down by low expectations, contributing to her move to the right. Shortly before the debate, Sunak’s team had released a quirky black-and-white Pathé News-style video drawing attention to the fact that he backed Brexit in 2016, unlike Truss. Conor McGinn, Labour’s deputy national campaign coordinator, said the style of it “feels about right for the guy who as chancellor has brought us the highest taxes and biggest drop in living standards in 70 years … Rishi Sunak’s taken us back to the 1950s”. One of the few striking moments of consensus in the debate, in which the candidates repeatedly confronted each other, was when presenter Julie Etchingham asked them to raise their hands if they would welcome Boris Johnson into their cabinet. None of them did so – though Mordaunt said “he got Brexit done”. All five also said they would not call a general election to give them a mandate if they won the leadership contest this autumn. Tom Tugendhat attacked his rivals for remaining in the government propping up Johnson, saying: “Even really good people lent credibility to the chaos.” Related: ‘Arms race’ over tax cuts shows Tory leadership candidates want a reset Dominic Raab, the deputy prime minister, who supports Sunak, earlier suggested Truss’s record in government belied her claim to be a tax-cutter. “Liz can answer for her policies and her record; she was chief secretary of the Treasury. People can see whether spending and headcount in the civil service went up or down,” he told Sophy Ridge on Sky News. “Did she cut taxes at that time?” The debate was the second of three televised clashes between the candidates. Half of the original field of 10 contenders, including Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt, have already been knocked out, after two rounds of voting. Further votes among MPs will be held on Monday, Tuesday and if necessary Wednesday, with the final two candidates then presented to Conservative members, who will make the final decision by 5 September. A new online survey of party members, published on Sunday by website Conservative Home, suggested Mordaunt’s popularity may have peaked. It showed Truss beating Sunak by 49% to 42% and Mordaunt by 48% to 41% in head-to-head comparisons. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST Mordaunt had earlier criticised what she called the “toxic politics” of the race, and “smears” against her. Documents leaked to the Sunday Times suggested Mordaunt was prepared to remove some, though not all, of the medical requirements for individuals opting to change their gender. Badenoch, her successor as equalities minister, who is also running for the leadership, has said Mordaunt’s stance in the past was to push for self-identification. That contradicts Mordaunt’s insistence in Friday’s Channel 4 debate that she was “never in favour of self-ID”. Badenoch told the Sunday Times: “I’m not going to call her a liar, I think it’s very possible she genuinely did not understand what she was signing off. It’s a very complex area.”","Id":"uk-news/2022/jul/17/its-socialism-heated-tory-leadership-debate-exposes-deep-divisions","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"‘It’s socialism’: heated Tory leadership debate exposes deep divisions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/17/its-socialism-heated-tory-leadership-debate-exposes-deep-divisions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/jul/17/its-socialism-heated-tory-leadership-debate-exposes-deep-divisions","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":997,"webPublicationDate":"2022-07-17T19:47:55Z","hosted":false,"id":"uk-news/2022/jul/17/its-socialism-heated-tory-leadership-debate-exposes-deep-divisions"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"If you want to hit Russian economy hard, aim for energy export","body":"At the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a week ago, almost every analyst agreed that Russian oil and gas would keep flowing westwards. The state of mutual energy dependence seemed too entrenched. On one side, the EU could not decouple itself easily from the source of 38% of its natural gas imports. On the other, Russia under financial sanctions would need cash. Old hands reflected that, even in the long decades of the cold war, the Soviet Union and Europe maintained commercial relationships in energy. A week later, such thinking looks naive. The “shock and awe” financial sanctions, especially those aimed at Russia’s central bank, exceed anything previously seen, but the shortcoming is obvious: if you really want to hit the Russian economy hard, the place to aim is its energy export sector, a part that has been spared sanctions so far and generates hundreds of millions of dollars daily. The point is made repeatedly by Ukrainian officials in their appeals for the trade to cease, and its moral force is hammered home with every fresh Russian atrocity. The White House said on Wednesday it is “very open” to the idea of energy sanctions on Russia. One might say cynically that it is easier to air such sentiments from Washington than Europe, but even German ministers are publicly taking about what would happen if Russia halted gas supplies suddenly. “We are prepared for that. I can give the all-clear for the current winter and summer,” said Robert Habeck, economy minister. Nuclear power stations, currently set for imminent closure, could be kept switched on and coal-fired stations could be used as back-up, he argued. If that’s really the case, the obvious question is why the west shouldn’t just get on with imposing a few energy sanctions – even if only caps on imports initially – and accept the financial pain. There is a foretaste already amid the various “self-sanctioning” measures taken by European refineries to avoid buying Russian oil and by European gas suppliers (including Centrica) to disentangle themselves from Gazprom. The price of a barrel of Brent hit $113 on Wednesday, the highest for seven years. UK natural gas prices returned to last autumn’s sky-high levels and pump prices are setting records. Prices would probably go even higher if full-blown energy sanctions were imposed, but what about security of supply? Here’s Brussels thinktank Bruegel: “If the EU is forced or willing to bear the cost, it should be possible to replace Russian gas already for next winter without economic activity being devastated, people freezing, or electricity supply being disrupted.” It also, it should be said, described the challenge as “momentous”, said rules would have to be rewritten and concluded “exceptional measures” may be needed to reduce demand. But the shorthand version seems to be: yes, if you are prepared to accept the costs, it’s doable. That, one suspects, is where the sanctions debate is rapidly heading. It should probably have been there from the off. Lack of faith in Aviva Aviva’s plan to return £4.75bn to shareholders didn’t quite reach the target of £5bn set by activist investor Cevian Capital, but the sum should be enough. The £250m gap can be mentally covered by Aviva’s accompanying £385m purchase of UK financial adviser firm Succession Wealth. Even activists tend not to object to conventional bolt-on acquisitions. The missing bit in the script is a higher share price. At 410p, Aviva stands roughly where it was three years ago, before chief executive Amanda Blanc got to work with a series of major overseas disposals and a heavy cost-cutting programme. It’s a slightly odd position. The fresh element of the return of capital represents a quarter of Aviva’s stock market value and Blanc’s dividend promise of 33p for 2023 represents a fat yield in the offing, which ought to get the attention of income investors. Put it down to a lack of faith in the idea that Aviva can really emerge as a reliable generator of cash. That’s hardly the fault of Blanc, who has done everything she promised and has now set a few financial targets to be judged on. But, yes, after 20 years of disappointments for shareholders, the idea that Aviva might be fixed may take a while to become truly believable.","Id":"world/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/02/if-you-want-to-hit-russian-economy-hard-aim-for-energy-export","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"If you want to hit Russian economy hard, aim for energy export","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/02/if-you-want-to-hit-russian-economy-hard-aim-for-energy-export","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/02/if-you-want-to-hit-russian-economy-hard-aim-for-energy-export","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":712,"webPublicationDate":"2022-03-02T19:22:48Z","hosted":false,"id":"world/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/02/if-you-want-to-hit-russian-economy-hard-aim-for-energy-export"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Tuesday briefing: The key exchanges from last night’s Tory leadership debate","body":"Good morning, and if I can just get to the end of this sentence without being interrupted by Rishi Sunak, I’ll have had a less irritating time than Liz Truss at the Conservative leadership debate last night when HANG ON, THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT oh well. It was that sort of evening. In truth, as the front-runner going in, Truss probably won’t have minded. The debate was pretty exhausting, but also interesting, if you’re judging it by whether it highlighted some of the differences between the candidates. But as the dust settled, there was little evidence that it had shifted the dial very much. Today’s newsletter will take you through the most important things Sunak and Truss said, and why they didn’t, actually, matter. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Archie Battersbee | The parents of a 12-year-old boy who suffered a “catastrophic” brain injury have been refused permission to appeal against a decision to end his life support treatment. The court of appeal said there were no grounds to challenge a high court ruling that continuing treatment was “futile”. UK news | A former BBC employee raised concerns about “unacceptable bullying” by Tim Westwood when he was a Radio 1 DJ but felt they were warned against taking further action, the Guardian has learned. In April Westwood faced accusations by seven women of sexual misconduct and predatory behaviour, which he denied. Labour | A row broke out in the shadow cabinet over Labour’s policy on renationalisation after Keir Starmer said he would not be “ideological” about the question. Starmer had pledged when he became leader to support common ownership of utilities like rail, mail and water. Ukraine | The Eurovision song contest will be hosted in the UK next year after Ukraine’s public broadcaster dropped its objections to the switch. The UK will host on behalf of this year’s winners but produce a programme that – in the words of the BBC – has “glorious Ukraine at its heart”.

Lord Trimble won the Nobel peace prize along with SDLP leader John Hume for his part in negotiations for the Good Friday agreement. In depth: ‘Rishi, that is not true’ Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss taking part in the BBC’s Conservative leadership debate. Photograph: Getty Images Sunak’s smartest-and-most-annoyed-guy-in-the-room energy was probably not the way to ingratiate himself with a group of voters who already prefer his opponent: crudely, nobody likes being told they’re wrong by a nerd. Perhaps his interruptathon (watch highlights here) was intended to nudge Truss into a gaffe, but if so, it surely failed: a snap poll by Opinium on who performed best had the two about level among all voters, and Truss ahead by 47-30 among those who vote Tory. Even if you rightly take opinion polls with a pinch of salt, it seems pretty unlikely that Sunak will have won a big majority in the opposite direction among party members, which is the kind of earthquake he needs – quickly – to win. If, for some unknowable reason, you had better things to do last night, here are some of the key passages (lightly edited and condensed), and what they revealed: *** The economy and the cost of living crisis Rishi Sunak The question is, should we pay [the coronavirus support] bill ourselves, or do we put it on the country’s credit card? … I don’t think that’s right. I don’t think it’s responsible. And it’s certainly not Conservative. Liz Truss Under my plans we would start paying down the debt in three years time. So I’m not putting it on the never never, I would start paying it down - Sunak That’s simply not right. You promised almost £40bn of unfunded tax cuts … it’s our children and grandchildren … who are going to have to pick up the tab. Truss That is not true. Rishi, that is not true. • The economy and the cost-of-living crisis were the longest section of the debate, but it all sounded familiar: Sunak promising responsible stewardship and a Tory emphasis on “sound money”, Truss insisting that tax increases would lead Britain into recession and accusing her opponent of “negative, declinist” policies. Maybe the most difficult moment for Truss was Sunak’s focus on the Brexiteer economist Patrick Minford, whom Truss cited as a supporter and who subsequently said her policies would push interest rates up to 7%. Sunak tried to cast Truss as irresponsible and un-Conservative, while she insisted her timeline for debt repayment was sensible. To most observers, the above exchange will have been more telling as an index of their hostilities than as a description of two grand economic visions. *** Brexit Sunak (on the impact of borrowing on interest rates) US mortgage rates are almost 50% higher than mortgage rates in this country because they’re borrowing so much. Truss I’m sorry, this is scaremongering. This is Project Fear. Sunak Liz, I remember the referendum campaign, and there were only one of us who was on the side of Remain and Project Fear, and it was you, not me. Truss Maybe I’ve learned from that. • There was barely any discussion of Brexit – other than some frankly brain-melting fights for ownership of played-out referendum fodder like Project Fear. Both answered a flat “no” when asked if leaving the EU had played a part in the current travel chaos at Dover and Folkestone, a view which most analysts suggest does not stand up to serious scrutiny. The tenor of the discussion suggested that both campaigns are working on the assumption that Brexit is more a purity test for Conservative members than a subject for sincere debate. But within that ecosystem, a penitent Remainer like Truss is more rejoiced over than a Leaver like Sunak with a less combative stance towards the EU. *** Foreign policy Sunak Liz has been on a journey as well. There was a time when Liz was talking about having a golden era of relationships with China … What we do need to do is acknowledge that China is a threat to national security, it’s a threat to our economic security. Truss Rishi, I challenged you on this in the debate last week. As recently as a month ago, you were pushing for closer trade relationships with China. This is not something you’ve advocated in government. I’m delighted that you’ve come around to my way of thinking. • The chest-beating over Project Fear was matched by both candidates’ rhetoric over China, with vague promises to “crack down on TikTok” featuring prominently. Neither seriously engaged with fears that decoupling with the world’s second largest economy will be unsustainable for the UK, and it seems likely the winner will edge away from their commitments after the leadership election is over. There was little disagreement on Ukraine, with both standing by the government’s record and ruling out active military engagement. *** The climate crisis Asked “What three things should people change in their lives to help tackle climate change?” Sunak Reducing energy usage through things like better energy efficiency is an obvious thing we can do … The second one is recycling, and that is the thing that in our house we are obsessive about. I know it’s a pain, you need lots of bins … And I think the third thing I would say, you really got to focus on innovation. Truss I was a teenage eco-warrior … I’m naturally a thrifty person, I like saving money … so it’s about using less, wasting less, particularly food waste, which I think is a massive problem in this country, but also the innovation that we need … but what I don’t want to see is ordinary households penalised by our net zero target, so I would lift the green energy levy and cut money from people’s fuel bills while looking for better ways to deliver on net zero. • Easily the most disappointing feature of the debate was the superficiality of the discussion of the climate crisis, a failing that should be laid as firmly at the BBC’s door as the candidates: a question about personal choices is unlikely to provoke a substantial conversation about the massive governmental action needed. Sunak and Truss were both happy to focus on “lots of bins” (for a whole range of breads?) and “saving money”. That approach was facilitated by the lack of a single follow-up question, like whether Truss’s promise to find “better ways to deliver on net zero” is credible if she can’t identify them. One minute 56 seconds of the hour-long debate were devoted to the climate crisis, against five minutes 45 seconds on matters arising from Sunak’s suit and Truss’s earrings. Which brings us to: *** The tone of the debate After a question about a row yesterday over Truss supporter Nadine Dorries saying on Twitter that Sunak’s suit cost £3,500: Sunak I’ve got enormous respect and admiration for Liz … it’s very simple. I think in the Conservative party, we judge people by their character and their actions ... I’m standing here because of the hard work, the sacrifice, and love of my parents and the opportunities they provided for me. Truss Well, I have to confess that since this campaign started, I’ve deleted Twitter from my phone … look, I don’t have any issue with how expensive anybody else’s clothes are. And actually, I think Rishi is a very finely dressed person. • To state the obvious, calling Sunak “finely dressed” is not the friendly compliment Truss was making it out to be. While the entire debate was acrimonious, it also had a patina of civility – or, at any rate, when the candidates were given the chance to say they hated each other, they didn’t take it. Both said they would be happy to work together in government, but their disagreements over the economy have been repeated so often, and in such apocalyptic terms, that you can barely see them voting for each other’s programme from the backbenches, much less sitting at the same cabinet table. Towards the end of the hour, Truss said “it’s been fantastic working with you, we’ve always got on well”, and offered Sunak a job: at about the same time, a spokesman for Truss said he had proven he “is not fit for office” and accused him of “aggressive mansplaining and shouty private school behaviour”. That doesn’t seem like the most glowing endorsement for a future colleague – but it did roughly capture the level of the hostilities on show. *** Read more on the Tory leadership race Zoe Williams | A debate devoid of dignity Rafael Behr | Playground bragging from a party without a purpose Patrick Wintour | Sunak aims to outmanoeuvre Truss over China Polly Toynbee | Candidates aren’t facing up to dire state of the NHS Nesrine Malik | What this absurd class cosplay tells us about Britain What else we’ve been reading In 2013, Rachel Grashow and Ken Walton decided that their family would look a little different - their egg donor would be a part of their children’s lives.

There were also reports that Truss, who is expected to be named as the new prime minister on Monday, was considering freezing energy bills this winter at a cost mooted to be as high as £100bn. Asked about her national insurance policies, she said it was fair that her planned tax cut would benefit the highest earners 250 times more than the poorest, arguing it was wrong to view all economic policy through the “lens of redistribution”. As analysts warned that relying on boosting economic growth to reduce income inequalities could increase disparities, Tory grandees sounded the alarm over what they said risked being an doctrinaire approach.

In her only in-depth media interview of the two-month Tory leadership campaign, which took place after voting had closed, Truss told BBC One’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg show she would provide immediate help with energy bills if elected, but declined to say how. “Within one week I will make sure there is an announcement on how we are going to deal with the issue of energy bills, and of long-term supply, to put this country on the right footing for winter,” Truss said. “I understand that people are struggling, that businesses are also concerned about their energy bills and the impact it could have on their future.” Truss nonetheless dismissed what she called fears of “an Armageddon scenario”, adding: “Britain has been through worse in the past – we have the attitude and spirit to get through it.” Pledging to ensure secure long-term energy supplies, Truss said she did back some aspects of renewable sources but stressed her plans to push ahead with more North Sea drilling and fracking for shale gas. Reports on Sunday night said that her team were discussing freezing gas and electricity bills with industry leaders. The level of the price cap has not been set but, according to the Times, the cost of the package is understood to be at the level of the Covid furlough scheme. On the economy, she emphasised her prioritisation of tax cuts, saying it was more important to grow the economy than to try to reduce economic inequalities. Shown calculations that her planned reversal of a recent rise in national insurance would benefit top earners by about £1,800 a year, and the lowest earner by about £7, and asked if this was fair, Truss said: “Yes, it is fair.” She said: “The people at the top of the income distribution pay more tax, so inevitably when you cut taxes, you tend to benefit people who are more likely to pay tax. “But to look at everything through the lens of redistribution, I believe, is wrong. Because what I’m about is growing the economy. And growing the economy benefits everybody. So far, the economic debate for the past 20 years has been dominated by discussions about distribution. But what’s happened is that we have had relatively low growth.” Truss has repeatedly stressed her focus on lower taxes, reduced regulation and a smaller state, but such explicit advocacy of what resembles the trickle-down economics of the US under Ronald Reagan marks a striking break from Boris Johnson’s often interventionist levelling up agenda. Luke Hildyard, the executive director of the High Pay Centre, a thinktank that focuses on ideas for a fairer UK, said the country was already one of the most unequal developed economies. “By any reasonable benchmark, we really don’t do a lot to address unequal income distribution,” he said. “Saying, ‘We need to cut taxes for the rich’ and ‘We need to generate economic growth’ is at best making two random unrelated statements and at worst actively contradictory.” Interactive Philip Hammond, a Conservative former chancellor, told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show that while he was an admirer of Truss in the past, immediate tax cuts “would deliver an inflationary stimulus and that is not the right thing to do”. The former minister David Davis, who comes from the same low-tax wing of the Conservative party as Truss, said she should in particular “think quite hard about” her plan to reduce corporation tax, warning that a failure to balance the books risked inflation, higher interest rates and a plummeting pound. “The worst outcome is, as it were, to give low taxes a bad name,” Davis said, adding that when in power Margaret Thatcher initially increased some taxes. Davis also urged Truss to appoint a broad range of opinions to her cabinet, including Sunak “The greatest mistake that Boris Johnson made was that he created a cabinet of loyalists. It wasn’t the best people,” he said. Truss, however, has shown few signs of giving way on either points, telling the BBC: “I follow through on what I say I’ll do.” While her campaign team is refusing to comment on possible ministerial posts, it is widely expected she will mainly appoint allies and loyal MPs from the right of the Tory party, with occasional exceptions such Tom Tugendhat, who is tipped for a junior role. Thérèse Coffey, the work and pensions secretary who is close to Truss, is expected to go to health. Chancellor and foreign secretary are still tipped to go to Kwasi Kwarteng and James Cleverly. Suella Braverman, who made a leadership bid from the party’s culture war right wing, could become home secretary, while Jacob Rees-Mogg is expected to head the business department. Also speaking to Kuenssberg, Sunak said targeted support was needed to tackle the energy bills crisis. “I think everyone is going to need some help given the scale of the challenge,” he said. “And then two other groups of people who will need further help. That’s those on the lowest incomes, about a third of all households in the country, and then the third group of pensioners.” Sunak said he would remain as an MP if he lost, and did not rule out another attempt at the leadership. “Oh gosh, we’ve just finished this campaign,” he said, when asked if he could stand again. “So, I’d say I need to recover from this one. But I look forward to supporting the Conservative government in whatever capacity.”","Id":"politics/2022/sep/04/liz-truss-energy-prices-action-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Truss to push ahead with low-tax economy despite calls for caution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/04/liz-truss-energy-prices-action-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/sep/04/liz-truss-energy-prices-action-plan","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":1095,"webPublicationDate":"2022-09-04T22:25:13Z","hosted":false,"id":"politics/2022/sep/04/liz-truss-energy-prices-action-plan"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Finland election: tight race has Marin’s SDP polling behind far right","body":"Four years after she became the world’s youngest prime minister, Finland’s Sanna Marin faces a battle to keep her job on Sunday in an unpredictable election so tight that it could be won by any of the country’s three main parties. Marin, now 37, took the reins of the Social Democratic party (SDP) – and the Finnish premiership – in 2019 and has since piloted the traditionally non-aligned Nordic country through the Covid pandemic and to the brink of Nato membership. Along the way her determination to enjoy her private social life has made global headlines, earning her fans who see her as a role model for a new generation of young female leaders, and critics who believe she has behaved inappropriately and irresponsibly. Amid a looming recession and surging inflation, however, her rightwing opponents have accused her of borrowing excessively and failing to rein in public spending, and a final poll before voting day showed the SDP narrowly trailing its two main rivals. The poll for the public broadcaster Yle, with a margin of error of two percentage points, put the conservative National Coalition party (NCP) on 19.8%, the far-right, nationalist Finns party on 19.5%, and Marin’s Social Democrats on 18.7%. Riikka Purra, leader of the far-right Finns party, with which several other parties have ruled out forming a coalition. Photograph: Reuters “At this stage, nobody can know what order the three leading parties will finish in on Sunday,” said Jenni Karimäki, a political historian at the University of Helsinki. “There’s barely a percentage point between them. It could be any of them.” Karimäki said Marin – who apologised and took a drug test last year, but also defended her right to party, after photos and video emerged of her drinking and dancing with friends – remained more popular than other leaders and her party. “It is unusual for the party of the outgoing prime minister to still be doing so well this close to an election and that is at least partly because of her popularity,” Karimäki said. “She’s an asset to the SDP. The prime minister’s party usually suffers more.” A survey for the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper in December found that 64% of respondents felt Marin had done a “very” or “fairly” good job as prime minister. The approval rating even higher among women, at 69%. But in a campaign focused on the economy and the cost of living crisis, claims of fiscal irresponsibility and calls for deep cuts to restore the state finances from the opposition leaders Petteri Orpo of the NCP and Riikka Purra of the Finns have hit home. Marin argues spending on education and public health services is key to economic growth, which she says is what will help Finland avoid further borrowing. She would prefer to raise taxes than cut spending. The NCP has proposed painful welfare cuts. The Finns party, which was in government for the first time from 2015 to 2017, says its priorities are to cut immigration from non-EU developing countries, which Purra has described as “harmful”, and postpone carbon neutrality past 2035. “It’s doing well under a relatively new leader,” said Emilia Palonen, a populism expert at the University of Helsinki. “An ethno-nationalist, anti-migrant, radical right party that has streamlined its ideological line and draws an anti-establishment vote.” The leader of the winning party has the first shot at forming a new government and normally becomes prime minister, but coalition talks this time are expected to be long and tortuous with several parties having ruled out options, especially with the Finns. “A lot looks like it will depend on the scores of the medium and smaller parties,” Palonen said. “Which of them do well enough to make up the numbers for a majority, and whether or not those that do are prepared to strike a deal with the winners.” Marin’s SDP and two of her current five-party coalition, the Greens and the Left Alliance, have said they will not go into government with the Finns, which Marin earlier this year described as “openly racist”. Of Marin’s two other partners, the Swedish People’s party has said it is “very unlikely” to partner with the far-right party, while the once-powerful, agrarian Centre party, whose vote has plunged in recent years, will not join any coalition resembling the current one. The NCP, for its part, has not excluded any combination, saying it will wait to see the results. If it finishes first, it could put together a right-leaning “blue-black” coalition with the Finns or choose to pursue a broad “blue-red” alliance with the SDP. As many as 10 parties could win seats in the 200-seat parliament. Polls open at 9am local time on Sunday, and early results from the 31% of voters who cast their ballots in advance will be released at 8pm when polling stations close. Final results should be clear by midnight.","Id":"world/2023/apr/01/finland-election-tight-race-sanna-marin-sdp-ncp-finns","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Finland election: tight race has Marin’s SDP polling behind far right","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/01/finland-election-tight-race-sanna-marin-sdp-ncp-finns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/01/finland-election-tight-race-sanna-marin-sdp-ncp-finns","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":792,"webPublicationDate":"2023-04-01T07:00:44Z","hosted":false,"id":"world/2023/apr/01/finland-election-tight-race-sanna-marin-sdp-ncp-finns"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"US debt ceiling deal: House rules committee debates bill amid criticism on both sides – as it happened","body":"10.12pm BST Today in summary Democrats and Republicans contended with the debt ceiling deal reached over the long weekend.

Related: McCarthy insists Republican support for debt deal ‘easy’ despite vocal opposition House Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries, said his party is “committed to making sure we do our part in avoiding default”. Points of contention included expanded work requirements for long-term recipients of food stamp benefits. Republicans said that the new work requirements would save money, and help get poor Americans back on their feet – despite studies indicating otherwise (work requirements don’t increase work or earnings).

Ultimately, if it would save the federal government any money – as Republicans claim it would. Under the deal, so-called able-bodied adults who are 54 and younger and do not have children must work or participate in work training programs to get access to food stamps for an extended period. The current work requirements apply to those age 49 and under, and anti-poverty advocates said the changes could disproportionately impact poor, older Americans. The White House, however, estimates that since many food stamp recipients are unhoused, veterans, or both – expanded access for those groups could ultimately mean that the number of people who are exempt from work requirements will be relatively unchanged. Updated at 9.58pm BST 9.06pm BST Colorado representative Joe Neguse got into a disagreement with Missouri representative Jason Smith about whether the Biden administration submitted the budget late, despite Republicans not submitting a budget at all. “Only in the rules committee could the witness lay blame at the president for being a few weeks late in submitting his budget, when his party hasn’t submitted a budget, period,” said Neguse. Neguse added that Republicans submitted a bill, but not a budget. Before the disagreement, Neguse doubled down on previous comments that the current debt ceiling crisis is Republican’s fault. “This is a manufactured crisis. No question about it. House Republicans are in control. You have the gavels. You’re in the majority.

Donald Trump’s lawyer tasked with searching for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after the justice department issued a subpoena told associates that he was waved off from searching the former president’s office, where the FBI later found the most sensitive materials anywhere on the property. The lawyer, Evan Corcoran, recounted that several Trump aides had told him to search the storage room because that was where all the materials that had been brought from the White House at the end of Trump’s presidency ended up being deposited. Corcoran found 38 classified documents in the storage room. He then asked whether he should search anywhere else, like Trump’s office, but was steered away, he told associates. Corcoran never searched the office and told prosecutors the 38 papers were the extent of the material at Mar-a-Lago. The assertion that there were no classified documents elsewhere at the property proved to be wrong when the FBI seized 101 classified documents months afterwards, including from the office, which was found to be where the most highly classified documents had been located.

Another 18% of such voters think Trump is probably the strongest possible GOP nominee. This, remember, is a former president who has pleaded not guilty to 34 criminal counts over a hush money payment to the porn star Stormy Daniels; who was found liable for sexual assault and defamation against the writer E Jean Carroll, and fined $5m; who faces further problems in a related case after continuing to criticise Carroll; who faces a New York state civil suit over his business affairs; who faces indictment in state and federal investigations of his election subversion, including inciting the deadly January 6 attack on Congress; and also faces indictment over his retention of classified materials. He’s also the former president who, according to the Washington Post, made 30,573 false or misleading statements in his four years in office. That too. In the Monmouth poll, 13% of Republicans thought another candidate would definitely be the strongest nominee and 19% said another would probably be strongest.

What are its chances of getting through? While lawmakers have expressed confidence that the bill would successfully get past Congress, some hardline Republicans have signaled they will not sign the deal. Representative Chip Roy of Texas, a member of the Rules committee, has urged fellow lawmakers to vote no on the deal. “This is not a deal that we should be taking,” Roy told Fox News’ Glenn Beck on Tuesday. What’s in the deal? If passed, the deal would suspend the US debt limit through 1 January 2025, well past the next US presidential election, which is in November 2024. But suspending the debt limit is a temporary measure, and the US would need to bring down the national debt or raise the ceiling by the new deadline. The deal would keep non-defense spending roughly the same for fiscal year 2024 and raise it by 1% in fiscal year 2025. The bill would also place new restrictions on SNAP benefits, limiting the number of individuals eligible for food stamps. Unspent emergency aid related to the Covid-19 pandemic, totaling about $30bn, will also be returned to the government. Read the full explainer here.

Dan Bishop (@RepDanBishop) May 30, 2023 Updated at 7.43pm BST 2.57pm BST McCarthy’s position as House speaker seems safe despite disagreements within debt ceiling debate. Here’s analysis on the issue from Politico: Two dynamics help explain why McCarthy has been resilient — at least so far: (1) The backroom horse-trading, it turns out, helped McCarthy forge relationships with the right in a way his predecessors never did. And (2) the GOP base simply isn’t up in arms opposing him… In fact, McCarthy’s approval rating has jumped by 10 points among Republicans since he took the gavel, hovering at 66%, according to a recent YouGov/Economist poll. Anecdotally speaking, even Biggs — who hails from a district DONALD TRUMP carried by 15 points in 2020 — told Playbook that his constituents think McCarthy’s doing “fairly well” and are “not really focusing on McCarthy’s speakership.” BRENDAN BUCK, who worked for both Boehner and Ryan, said McCarthy appears to have learned from both — that “the worst thing a speaker can do is become a problem back home for their members,” he said. “He has gone out of his way to make sure that their support for him is never going to be a problem, minding the right every step of the way so that nobody can say: ‘You’re a vulnerability to me.’” McCarthy also learned a thing or two about managing his right flank — bringing his conservative critics into the fold rather than seeking to marginalize them as Boehner and Ryan did. How much power he actually ceded them, though, is another question. Updated at 7.45pm BST 2.36pm BST Biden and McCarthy have said they believe the negotiated debt ceiling deal will pass.

In an interview with Politico, Virginia representative Bob Good, a Republican, said the deal was not “much different than what we could have gotten with a Democrat majority in the House”. Republican lawmaker Chip Roy called the tentative agreement a “turd-sandwich” in a tweet, countering claims made by McCarthy in a Fox News interview that Republicans are satisfied by the deal, the Hill reported. 1st - the leadership playbook is to line up cheerleading on phone calls to demonstrate “unity.” 2nd, not 95% - I know of more no’s than that already. 3rd - they haven’t been educated yet on what a turd-sandwich this “deal” is. They will be. https://t.co/gaJhMT6LM3 — Chip Roy (@chiproytx) May 28, 2023 Updated at 7.45pm BST 2.14pm BST Back from Memorial Day holiday, both parties are set to have internal discussions about the latest debt ceiling deal. Tomorrow, House Democrats will hold a closed-door meeting on the bill, which now includes some work requirements for federal assistance. Eligibility requirements for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) would be changed under the deal, raising the age from 50 to 54 for people who must work at least 20 hours a week to qualify for food-assistance benefits, reports ABC News. Far-right Republicans will hold a press conference on the plan at 12pm eastern time today, as several members say they will vote against the deal which they argue does not go far enough. House Republicans will then hold their own closed door meeting about the legislation at 7.30pm. Updated at 7.46pm BST 1.52pm BST Biden and McCarthy debt ceiling deal now faces battle to get through the House Good morning. Joe Biden and Kevin McCarthy’s debt ceiling agreement has come after a months-long stalemate and stalled negotiations on both sides. And it is not out of the woods yet. The deal now faces scrutiny from House members – amid reports of criticism from both sides. Unveiled Sunday, the deal will raise the country’s $34.1tn borrowing limit and include caps on government spending and policy changes to federal aid programs. The compromise still needs to pass the House and Senate before 5 June, when the US could default. Far-right Republicans have said they will vote against the deal. Some conservatives argue that the compromise doesn’t go far enough to reduce spending or target Democratic legislation, such as Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan. For now, amid the discontentment, lawmakers say it is unlikely that party members will call for McCarthy to step down from his position as House speaker. Meanwhile, progressive legislators are also unhappy with the latest debt ceiling plan. Many have criticized Biden for negotiating with Republicans under the threat of a default and including work requirements for federal assistance in the deal. Here’s what’s happening today: 12pm Members of the House Freedom Caucus will hold a news conference outside the Capitol. 3pm The House rules committee meets to prepare the bill to be debated. 6.30pm Congress will vote on unrelated bills. It will give Democrat and Republican whips a first chance to count votes in person. 7.30pm House Republican leaders will host a closed-door meeting.

Some argue the arms race of populist policies from Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak exemplifies a new Conservatism, one fundamentally altered by Brexit and Boris Johnson, which has gradually absorbed the priorities of those who used to support Ukip. Others, however, say robust talk on immigration is nothing new for a party that pioneered the hostile environment and was already trying to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, while talk of tax cuts is almost mandatory when the Tories pick a new leader. But could all this be missing the point? Some experts query whether the avalanche of hard-right policy ideas, particularly on immigration and asylum, simply show a party out of touch with a public now notably more worried by issues like the cost of living. One change does seem obvious. While the Conservatives have always had a strain of authoritarian rightwing opinion, this was balanced by a more liberal wing – one which, since Johnson became leader, has almost disappeared. Anna Soubry, the former Conservative minister who quit the party for the ill-fated Change UK, argues that people with views like her, Kenneth Clarke, David Gauke and Dominic Grieve were once “pretty much the mainstream”. Interactive “We weren’t the radicals, we were the norm, and now everything has changed,” she said. “Almost none of us are in parliament any more, and the ones who are left are now the fringe. And the mad people are running the government.” As to whether the leadership contest shows a further rightward drift from Johnsonism, there was some evidence of this in early skirmishes which featured bullish, US-style talk about identity politics and a drastically reduced state from the likes of Kemi Badenoch and Suella Braverman. With the cast now shrunk to Truss and Sunak, the focus has often been on immigration and asylum, with both promising to further toughen the Rwanda policy. Nick Lowles, the chief executive of Hope Not Hate, which monitors populist right and far-right sentiment, points to polling carried out for the group that shows what he calls a “notable shift” among Tory members on immigration and connected issues from 2018 to 2020. “The centre of gravity in the Tory party has shifted to the right quite considerably,” he said. “It’s no surprise that whether candidates privately support the Rwanda policy or not, they take a hardline public position.” Similarly, the leadership contest has seen a mass of pledges to cut taxes, with even the once fiscally sceptical Sunak performing a U-turn to say he would suspend VAT on energy bills. Interactive Neither has explicitly embraced the state-shrinking ethos of the likes of Badenoch, but the repeated talk of efficiencies and leaner organisations does imply a reduced role for public services. Both the final two have also been notably cautious over the climate emergency, with Truss committed to suspending green levies on energy bills, while Sunak has all-but ruled out any role for new onshore wind projects in England. The decision on which of the pair succeeds Johnson is made by Conservative members, which to a great extent explains the ideological tilt. There are, however, some signs the candidates might have misread even their own audience. New polling for the Onward thinktank has shown that Conservative voters are notably keen on the target of net zero emissions by 2050, with almost a quarter saying they would no longer back the party if the commitment was ditched. Rob Ford, professor of politics at the University of Manchester, argues that on immigration and taxation the party also risks becoming “increasingly out of line with where the public, and even the Conservative-voting public, are”. Interactive He points to research led by Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London, showing that while Conservative members are, as you might expect, notably more rightwing on economic issues, Tory MPs are even more right-leaning. “This tax-cutting, Singapore-on-Thames Thatcherism has always been a kind of elite hobby,” Ford said. “There has never been a mass electorate for that stuff. But the people who like it, like it so intensely that they kind of project this idea on to their membership.” On immigration, long-term YouGov tracking of the three issues voters view as most important has seen the percentage picking immigration more than halve since before the Brexit referendum in 2016, while the proportion citing the economy has shot up. “For a very long time, and not without reason, the Conservative party has regarded being authoritarian on immigration and asylum as essentially a no-lose position,” Ford said. “And I don’t know if that’s true any more. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am “Attitudes towards immigration are more positive now than they have been at any point for which we have polling in modern politics. It’s a strange context in which to be launching very hardline immigration policies. “It’s also not a pressing issue with voters in general, or Conservative voters, or even with socially conservative Conservative voters. This is an answer to a question no one is asking anymore. “People care about paying their gas bills. The bit of the Home Office they’re concerned about is getting a passport in time to go on holiday. It all risks looking out of touch, which wasn’t true in the past.”","Id":"politics/2022/aug/01/righter-than-right-tory-conservative-hardline-drift-public-opinion","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Righter than right: Tories’ hardline drift may lose the public","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/01/righter-than-right-tory-conservative-hardline-drift-public-opinion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/01/righter-than-right-tory-conservative-hardline-drift-public-opinion","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":915,"webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T05:00:15Z","hosted":false,"id":"politics/2022/aug/01/righter-than-right-tory-conservative-hardline-drift-public-opinion"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Leaders face off in final debate – as it happened","body":"2.29pm BST What we learned from the final leaders' debate of the election campaign The main point is that you should stay tuned for Sarah Martin and Katharine Murphy’s takes. See you here tomorrow for more considered news and analysis. We did learn, though, that: It’s possible to have a more considered, civil conversation. The main contrast between prime minister Scott Morrison and Labor leader Anthony Albanese’s perspectives is that Morrison says Australians are the answer, while government is the “shield”. Albanese says “we can do better”. Morrison says government can’t pay for everything, where Albanese says childcare (for example) is an investment, not a payout. Both leaders ruled out carbon and mining taxes (Morrison insists Labor’s strengthening of a Coalition policy is a stealth tax). Morrison will stick with his exposure draft for an integrity commission – Labor says it will have one with more teeth. Albanese says “disillusionment” is what’s turning voters towards independents; Morrison says it’s been a tough couple of years. Stopping the boats is still an issue. And on cost of living issues, Morrison says a strong economy will fix it, while Albanese says lifting wages and productivity is the answer. Morrison says you can’t mess with the Fair Work Commission on minimum wages; Albanese says you can suggest they lift them. Albanese wants a guaranteed minimum wage; Morrison says sure, but not for people in small businesses. Again, tomorrow will bring less tired brains to the conversation. See you then! Amy Remeikis will bring you all the news you need to know. Good night!

Who decided to call them “undecided voters” and not “loose units”. — Madura McCormack (@MaduraMcCormack) May 11, 2022 1.52pm BST They’re doing some individual pub results now, but it seems a little pointless to bombard you with numbers from the tiny ballot boxes. We’ll get an overall result soon. I hope. 1.47pm BST Samantha Maiden from news.com.au points out that Morrison’s new favourite phrase is “loose unit”. He’s walking a fine line to not look like a “nasty pastie”, she says. For me, the favourite stand-out moment was when [Morrison] was asked to say something nice about Anthony Albanese. He started recounting the little log cabin story and then he pivoted to say he was a flaming idiot. NB: I originally wrote “nasty pasty”, then changed it to “nasty pastie”. Now I am an undecided voter on the spelling. Updated at 1.56pm BST 1.44pm BST After another little break we’re set to hear the results of the “pub test”. Always love hearing people talk about “who came out on top”. Just me? 1.38pm BST Up to the Northern Territory now, and the Labor-held seat of Solomon. Oh wait, we’ve whooshed to Boothby, the Liberal-held marginal seat in South Australia. Not sure what happened there. Alex says he hasn’t “necessarily” changed his mind. There are issues that weren’t addressed, like housing, he says. If pushed, though, he’d say Albanese won the debate. “It was a character issue,” he says. “He seemed more in touch.” James was more swayed by Labor on climate change and a federal integrity commission. He’s not ruling out a vote for an independent though. Jeanette says she wasn’t convinced by other side on cost of living. 1.33pm BST THIS IS THE FASTEST PUB CRAWL I’VE EVER BEEN ON. My head is spinning. Also the most sober. Also a bit like speed dating. We’re in WA now, in Liberal MP Ken Wyatt’s seat – Hasluck. Ron is still undecided. He thinks Albanese came across as “genuine”, and was disappointed with Morrison for taking any opportunity to have “a dig”. Actually he is “a bit clearer”. He also reflects on the “issues” with the former attorney general Christian Porter. Kirsty likes Albanese. “I like how he said ‘we can do better’,” she says. Updated at 1.35pm BST 1.29pm BST To Lilley in Brisbane. Oh, they actually have little Final Showdown ballot boxes! Simon’s made up his mind (but doesn’t say who). Cheryl’s equally coy. Kurt, though, is more explicit. He’s on Team Albo. “He used the word ‘we’,” he says. Updated at 1.30pm BST 1.26pm BST To Chisholm in Victoria, a marginal Liberal seat. Taylor doesn’t really like either of them. If she had to choose, it would be Albanese because of his focus on the “working class”. Morrison belittles people, she says, and she’d like more emphasis on climate change. She’ll probably vote Greens, she says. Pep (I think that was his name) is still undecided because the “devil is in the detail”. Updated at 1.31pm BST 1.22pm BST The people in the pubs speak Seven’s Michael Usher is now giving us a glimpse of the “pub test”, where undecided voters are set up in pubs across the country. To the Labor-held seat of Macquarie, first, in Sydney. Susan says she’ll go for “Albo” over “Scotty from marketing”. “He dodged questions,” she says. Dave is still undecided, but leaning towards Morrison because, he says, Labor’s policies are uncosted and “we know” what Morrison has done. Sarah is also heading more towards Morrison. Again, because of funding questions. Updated at 1.46pm BST 1.18pm BST We can do better, Albanese says: I have a plan for a better future, a plan to make sure we can grow the economy in a sustainable way by investing in infrastructure, by investing in climate policy, by making sure that no one is left behind and no one is held back. We can do better. We have a range of challenges facing us as a nation. We have childcare costs that are spiralling, that stop women working that fourth or fifth day. We can do better than that. We have had 22 attempts at climate policy and we have issues, floods and bushfires, we have seen the impact. We can do better than just continuing to drift there. We have pressure where so many people can’t see a doctor when they need one. We can do better than that. We have young Australians who can’t get the skills and training that they need for the jobs of the future. And we can do better than that. This election is a choice. It’s a choice over whether we seize the opportunities which are before us. We have a government that’s asking for three more years of more of the same. They don’t really have a plan or a policy for the future, because they struggle with the present. That’s why at this election we have got constructive plans and processes in place that we are putting forward to the Australian people. If we don’t elect a new government we will miss out on the opportunity to increase women’s economic participation through cheaper childcare. We will miss out on the opportunity to end the climate wars. We will miss out on the opportunity to deal with cost of living and stop everything going up except for people’s wages. If we can’t even get consensus here about a $1 increase for the minimum wage then I think that this country isn’t able to go forward. I firmly believe that we have a great future but in order to do that we need a better government. Anthony Albanese and Scott Morrison shake hands. Photograph: Reuters Updated at 1.51pm BST 1.16pm BST Leaders deliver closing statements We’re on to closing statements now. Morrison sneaks in a plug for having “called” for the aged care commission. He says: There are great opportunities ahead, Australia, and I’m really excited about them. Over the last couple of years we have come through the most difficult times that we could have ever imagined and couldn’t have contemplated through years ago, but here we are. We have stuck together. As a government we have backed you in. This is one of the big differences, I think, in what we have heard tonight. We believe in you, we believe a strong economy is based on you. We don’t believe the government is the answer, we believe you are the answer and that’s what our policies are designed to do. That’s why we believe a strong economy is the best way to enable you to fulfil your aspirations for you and your family. To shield you against the pressures that are going to come in the years ahead on our economy, putting upward pressure on interest rates and the cost of living. To shield that job, to shield that income and that business and that retirement saving that you have. It’s also going to guarantee those essential services so we can tackle the big problems in aged care. $19.1bn dollars to support our response to the aged care royal commission that I called. These are tough challenges. Continuing to support Medicare at record levels. Bulk billing at 88.8%, it’s up from 82.2% when we first came to government. To ensure we keep building those roads and infrastructure that keep you safer and get you home safe and on time to be with your family or to get to work. And to ensure that we continue to invest in our defence forces as we go forward, and our security and intelligence agencies. This election is a choice about who can manage and deliver that strong economy, because that’s what your future depends on. And now is not a time to risk that on an unproven opposition and Labor leader who don’t have a plan for our economy and haven’t got the experience with the challenges that we face. A vote for the Liberals and the Nationals on May 21 is the strong, responsible and safe choice for a strong economy, for a stronger future. Morrison spruiks Coalition response to aged care royal commission in closing statement. Photograph: Maskot/Getty Images Updated at 1.58pm BST 1.14pm BST The two leaders are asked to nominate something they respect about the other, and a weakness. (The exact wording is “What is the one strength [that you find in your opponent] that you admire but that also worries you?”) Morrison says: The thing about Anthony I’ve always admired he has never forgot where he has come from. He grew up in housing commission and I have no doubt that the other day on Mother’s Day is always probably the toughest day of each year, it is for him. And he has shown the ability to rise to be the leader of one of the oldest parties in this country, and he should be commended for that. He has shown a great deal of determination over that period of determination over that period of time to rise from very humble beginnings. I admire that in Australians and I admire that in Anthony. That’s great. But Morrison reckons Albanese isn’t across the detail. Morrison says something nice about Albanese. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP Albanese doesn’t bring up any negatives. He says: The job of prime minister is one that is obviously a difficult one to do. Scott’s absolutely committed to his nation. And I admire that. And on a range of issues, to name one, mental health in terms of young people. We have seen increased funding for mental health but in particular increased funding for Headspace and those issues. Mental health is something that when we were all a bit younger wasn’t spoken about. It’s a good thing it’s being spoken about, it’s a good thing the prime minister speaks about it as well. Updated at 1.20pm BST 1.12pm BST From Scarr, to Morrison: It has been reported that an MP in your party room suggested that childcare and women accessing childcare was outsourcing parenting. Do you agree, and is this an issue you ever talk to Jenny about? (Here’s the story on that.) Morrison says: It’s not something I agree with. And we talk about childcare and many issues all the time. Our children themselves went through childcare and we went through that with other parents and their families. We have a responsible and affordable policy on childcare. What we don’t do is go and promise the world when you know you can’t pay for it. If you go to 90% childcare for everybody that is a policy that all Australians are going to have to pay for. Albanese says: Where Scott, I think, is wrong on this issue is to see it as just a cost. It is an investment in women, it’s an investment in families, it’s an investment in our economy because it will grow, all the analysis shows that every time you spend a dollar on childcare more than $2 comes back. 1.09pm BST Albanese: childcare is economic reform, not welfare Scarr asks both leaders about the possibility of free childcare. Albanese says: We have a plan for more affordable childcare where 96% of families will be better off and 4% will be the same. We have also said that what we will do is have the Productivity Commission in our first term look towards whether you would move to a universal system of affordable childcare. What are the economic implications of that? Why do we do cheaper childcare? It’s not welfare, it’s economic reform. It will boost productivity, help business, help women’s retirement incomes. That’s just one element that we have. We also want to make gender pay equity an objective of the Fair Work Act. We want to make sure that we deliver on safe workplaces as well, which is why we will adopt all 55 recommendations of the Jenkins Review into safety in the workplace, including the obligations on employers to do what they can to make every workplace safe. Anthony Albanese is offered a cupcake during a meeting with advocacy group the Parenthood earlier today. Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP Morrison says things have got better for women: The gender pay gap has fallen from 17.4% under Labor to 13.8% where it is now, and it even went down to 13.4%. What does that mean? It means women today because of the closing of the gender pay gap under our government are better off. There are 1.1 million more women in work than when we came to government. Female participation in the workforce is at record levels Opportunities have been provided for women into get into the workforce and we have been championing women’s entrepreneurship and championing women in non-traditional trades and skills ... We have got $3.8 billion invested in the skills of our country providing record numbers of apprenticeships right now and women are taking up more and more of those jobs. Updated at 1.54pm BST 1.06pm BST Albanese says renewables are the cheapest way to provide electricity. Morrison says you invest in businesses to make changes. There’s more to and fro, I’ll check later if there was anything new in it. 1.05pm BST Scarr points out that economists say putting a price on carbon is the way to go to meet emissions targets. Albanese says: We have got a better system. We are using the Abbott government system that it created, the safeguard mechanism, but also what we have is a plan to fix transmission, what that’s about is making sure that renewables can plug into the grid. At the moment that’s one of the weaknesses that will stabilise the grid. We also have a plan for electric vehicles. At the last campaign Scott Morrison said that electric vehicles would end the weekend. We want to encourage the take-up by reducing taxes on electric vehicles. Morrison says Labor wants a stealth carbon tax (through that previously mentioned Abbott government initiative) and that Labor will drive up electricity prices (he brings up some debunked modelling – check out our factcheck). Updated at 1.06pm BST 1.02pm BST Both leaders rule out carbon tax We’re back. Riley is joined by the West Australian’s political editor, Lanai Scarr. She asks both sides to categorically rule out a carbon or a mining tax. (Is this the question that Riley said could stump them both?) Both rule them out. And now it’s all about the battle for WA seats. Morrison says: We never have, never will have a mining or a carbon tax. Under our government our taxes will always be lower, because right now if you’re earning $90,000 at home there today, you are paying $50 a week less in tax every single week because of the tax cuts we have already legislated and delivered, and there’s more to follow in the next term, where between $45,000 and $200,000 you will pay no more than 30 cents in the dollar. We are the party of lower taxes. We have always delivered lower taxes. One of the reasons WA was able to achieve that surplus was the GST deal that we were able to ensure that WA got their fair share of the GST. As treasurer and as prime minister I fought for it, I delivered it, and Western Australia has got the benefit of that. Their fair share because it was in the national interest. Scott Morrison after visiting the Melt Prototyping and Innovation Accelerator earlier today. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP Albanese says: Yes, we will certainly rule them out and have done so. But when we talk about the success of Western Australia, one of the things I’ll be doing is working with Mark McGowan. Scott Morrison when he had a choice between Mark McGowan and Clive Palmer he chose Clive Palmer. He went to court as part of that, with the solicitor general, he spent taxpayers’ money backing up Clive Palmer’s legal case to open up WA’s borders. Now, WA has been successful under Mark McGowan because they have made tough decisions, which has helped tough decisions, which has helped to boost not just the WA economy but our entire national economy. Anthony Albanese with Dan Andrews yesterday on the campaign trail. Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP Updated at 2.00pm BST 12.55pm BST That was quite polite, Riley says, and now we’re having a short break. 12.55pm BST Riley says the previous discussion shows we need an independent integrity commission. Morrison says he has a bill for one, and has hundreds of pages to prove it. (He’s talking about an exposure draft, which he never put to parliament). He says: A body of this nature is important and you’ve got to get the design right and it can’t be driven by the whims of politics. It needs to be developed by good design where the rule of law applies. It applies to criminal conduct and we don’t see a situation where we have agencies that can go and convict people, before they have even heard the case, in the media. That is not a good way to run a country. That is not a good way to uphold integrity. I think it only undermines the process. (It sounds like he’s continuing his critique of the NSW Icac). Albanese says: We do need to clean up politics and we need a national anti-corruption commission and one with teeth. Under the model put forward by Mr Morrison, ministers would decide – have a decision to make – whether something was referred to an anti-corruption commission. It needs to be independent of politics. That’s the whole point of an independent national anti-corruption commission. The idea that somehow the opposition’s responsible for the government not even introducing legislation ... that, taken to its logical conclusion, why would you vote for Scott Morrison on Saturday week? Because what he says is, unless the opposition supports legislation, it won’t even come before the parliament. Updated at 12.58pm BST 12.51pm BST Albanese says the structure the Labor party has in place is that there would be an investigation if any complaint was made. Morrison says he didn’t wait for anyone to write to him to start an inquiry. “I acted swiftly,” he says. 12.50pm BST Riley asks about a reported payout to education minister Alan Tudge’s former press secretary. He asks: “Haven’t taxpayers got a right to know why they have paid half a million dollars in this?” Morrison says he held an independent inquiry into the matter, and adds that he’s been advised the matter hasn’t even been settled. He tries to switch the conversation to bullying allegations raised after the death of Labor senator Kimberley Kitching. 12.47pm BST Disillusionment with major parties leaving door open for independents, Albanese says We’re on to why the independents are proving so popular this election. Albanese says there’s disillusionment with both major parties, in part because of the leadership “revolving doors”. He says: The level of corrupt practices that we have seen in recent times has led to that as well. That’s one of the reasons why we need a strong national anti-corruption commission. We need to restore faith in politics. The people who are putting themselves forward at this election, regardless of what party [they do it] for all the right reasons. But the truth is there is a lack of faith out there ... we need to restore faith in politics. Anthony Albanese: ‘We need to restore faith in politics.’ Photograph: Lukas Coch/AFP/Getty Images Morrison says it was the pandemic what done it, and: Because the challenges that we face are very real and who can best run that economy, who best understands that economy? That is what will impact on your life and the ambitions you have for you and your family. I say to those thinking about independents, Australia doesn’t need a weak government that has to negotiate for its existence every single day. It needs a strong government like we have been over the last three years where we could make the strong decisions to get Australia through this difficult time. A vote for the independents may be well-meaning, but it would be a vote to weaken or parliament and weaken Australia. Updated at 1.01pm BST 12.44pm BST Riley says the difference is that Labor will abolish temporary protection visas. (You can read a factcheck on that here). Morrison says Albanese doesn’t know what it’ll be like if he gets into government: I just don’t believe he has got the stomach for it if he were to become prime minister. Albanese says: I believe Australia can do better. I believe we must do better. 12.41pm BST Albanese says that where Labor sees a good idea, they will support it. He says: The key to keeping our borders strong are the elements of the plan that would turn back boats, which we support, offshore processing which we support, and settlement in third countries, which we support. Anyone who comes by boat will not get any visa here in Australia, they won’t be allowed to settle here in Australia. We have the same position on all of those issues. 12.40pm BST Riley asks Morrison about boat turnbacks, and asks him to justify claims that under Labor the boats will start arriving again. Morrison says: We have fixed that with three clear policies. Turn the boats back where it’s safe to do so, offshore processing, and temporary protection visas. Mr Albanese has said if he is elected he will abolish temporary protection visas, that means permanent visas for people who have come on a boat. “I know how to keep them stopped, because I stopped them,” Morrison says. Updated at 12.43pm BST 12.39pm BST Morrison accuses Albanese of being an “armchair critic”, who is “wise in hindsight”. He says he’s not saying he’s always got things right but (in summary), we’ve done all right. 12.38pm BST Riley opens the floor for character assassinations on both sides. Morrison says: This is a Labor leader who comes from the far left of the party and has been very loose, he is a loose unit when it comes to the economy. He makes things up as he goes along. Albanese gets a chance to rebut that, and outlines his experience. Then he gets his own chance to have a crack: All we see from this government, that is now seeking a fourth term in office, they don’t have an agenda for today, let alone an agenda for the next term. All they have is abuse and scare campaigns and fear campaigns, no policies for the future. We can do better than that. And he brings up the “I don’t hold a hose” comment, and criticises the vaccine strollout, and so on. 12.35pm BST Quite the skirmish over submarines. Albanese has a crack at the $5-odd billion spent on the cancelled French contract. Morrison asks if he doesn’t support the submarines. You don’t either, Albanese says, you tore it up. The Aukus deal, Morrison says. So Albanese goes at him on waste on rorts. Updated at 12.36pm BST 12.33pm BST Albanese’s turn. He says: The truth is that people are just doing it really tough out there. Our measures on childcare, for example, will make it – how crazy is it, that in 2022, that some women, if they want to work a fourth or fifth day, it costs their family money. Everyone knows out there that when your youngest child goes into kindergarten all of a sudden families are better off. That makes no sense. No makes no sense. It’s a disincentive to work and to participate in the work force that really penalises families for having children. We need to do much better. Our energy policy will reduce electricity prices by $275 for households by 2025. We will have cheaper medicines, lowering the cost to $30. These are all practical steps that we will make. Riley asks about making sport available on free to air channel. Morrison takes the non sequitur as an opportunity to start the first barney of the debate. Updated at 12.35pm BST 12.31pm BST What can you do to turn things around for families, Mark Riley asks. Morrison says “we got the budget back into balance” before spending on the pandemic stimulus measures. He says: We didn’t want Australians to get hit down by the rising costs of living caused by the war in Europe, and issues in China, and the floods pushing up fruit and vegetable prices. So we cut fuel tax in half, [gave] $250 to pensioners and others on fixed incomes from the government and increased tax relief from 1 July, where families up to $126,000 a year will get an extra $420 they will keep of money they earned. But the tax cuts we provided continue into the future because they should keep more of what they earn and we have always delivered lower taxes. Geez, you’re smashing out the talking points, Riley says. Scott Morrison smashes out the talking points. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP Updated at 12.47pm BST 12.30pm BST Albanese says the AAA credit rating was achieved under Labor, and that Labor’s policies will boost productivity (he mentions child care, renewable energy, etc.). Morrison says increasing productivity is about investing in skills, and building infrastructure. Albanese says that’s just coming back from cuts, and that “we’ve seen infrastructure prioritised based upon colour-coded spreadsheets, not based upon productivity”. 12.27pm BST On those rising interest rates, Morrison says his government have kept “downward pressure” on them, and compares Australia to international examples. He says: We have got employment outcomes that are 50% better. That’s what a good economic plan looks like. That’s what good economic management looks like ... Now, we know that Australians through the pandemic have been taking good decisions, they have switched to fixed interest rates, they’ve got ahead of their mortgage. As a government, we’ve been showing the same responsibility. Updated at 12.30pm BST 12.25pm BST Wage increase would put jobs at risk, Morrison says Riley says a dollar an hour seems “pretty reasonable”. Morrison says a wage increase would put jobs at risk: If Mr Albanese thinks small businesses around the country can have a 5% increase in their wages bill on top of all the other things they’re facing, and see their ability to come through, then people won’t be worrying about what their wages are, they will be worrying about whether they have a job. Albanese refers to the last debate, where Morrison prevaricated on the idea that everyone should get the minimum wage. Morrison distinguishes between employees and small business owners. He says: People who run small businesses, Anthony, they don’t get guaranteed anything. They risk their businesses and their own incomes and their houses every single day, and they need the support to help employ Australians. Updated at 12.38pm BST 12.23pm BST Morrison says it’s the FWC that will make the decision. And he says a rise would feed into inflation, and interest rates, and therefore affect cost of living. He says you can’t “jawbone” the FWC: That’s why we think the most sensible way is to look at all of the evidence, not just run off at the mouth and come up with things on the run, but to consider these sorts of economic questions very carefully. Albanese says the minimum wage is $20.33 an hour or “two cups of coffee a day”. The idea that would damage the economy is “not the case”, he says. 12.21pm BST Riley is grilling Albanese on whether he can actually influence what the Fair Work Commission does. Albanese says: We are advocating publicly that people not get left behind. 12.20pm BST Morrison says (and this may come as a surprise to some) that wages have gone up. He says the minimum wage has increased by 7% over the course of his government (this needs a comparison to inflation). He says: Small businesses are doing it incredibly tough. They’re the ones who employ people and we want to ensure that they can keep employing people. And by having a sensible approach to wages policy they can employ people and pay them better wages. 12.19pm BST 'People are doing it tough': Albanese supports 5.1% wage increase The first question is on Albanese’s promise to support a 5.1% wage increase. He says it’s up to the Fair Work Commission, which “makes a decision independent of government”. But he’d welcome a rise, because “people are doing it tough out there”. He says: The idea that those heroes of the pandemic, those low-wage workers – people on the minimum wage are cleaners, they’re people working in the care sector, they’re people who work in retail, they are people who helped get us through the pandemic. They deserve more than our thanks. They don’t deserve a wage cut. Aged care workers and others on the minimum wage ‘deserve more than our thanks’, Albanese says. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP Updated at 2.15pm BST 12.17pm BST Albanese is talking up the opportunities that dealing with climate change offers, along with child care and aged care improvements. He says people have “conflict fatigue” and that he wants to bring them together: I want a better future where we deal with the cost of living crisis where everything is going up except for people’s wages. A better future where people, if they need to see a doctor, can see one; where we make Medicare better; where childcare is more affordable and women can participate in the economy and we can build productivity at the same time. A better future where dealing with climate change means taking up the opportunity to grow the economy with renewables and new industries, training people for those jobs with fee-free Tafe and additional university places, and a better future where we deal with the aged care crisis. Older Australians deserve to live in dignity and with respect in their later years. But it’s also important how they get there. I want us to bring together big business and unions, to bring together small business and their employees, to bring together the commonwealth, states and territories to work on a common interest. Australians have conflict fatigue. They want solutions, not arguments, and that’s what I want to deliver in delivering a better future, one where no-one is held back and no-one is left behind. Updated at 12.20pm BST 12.16pm BST We have “big challenges and uncertainties” to face, Morrison says, adding that a strong economy will make everything possible, and a weaker economy will make it harder. Now it’s Albanese’s turn. He begins with: I believe that good government can change people’s lives for the better. Updated at 12.18pm BST 12.14pm BST The economic “shield” gets an early airing from Morrison: As we all know the last few years have been very tough for Australians and I’ve never been more proud of my fellow Australians. As a government we have sought to back Australians every step of the way through the most difficult time we have seen since the second world war. Of course we haven’t got everything right but we have stood there with Australians, and right now Australia is one of the most successful economies to come out of this pandemic amongst the advanced economies of the world. We know that a strong economy is so important to everything that we hope to achieve as a nation, and will be into the future with the challenges and the uncertainties we face. A strong economy provides that economic shield for jobs, for incomes, for the businesses you run, to keep taxes low and to put downward pressure on the global forces that are pushing up interest rates and cost of living. Updated at 12.16pm BST 12.13pm BST Labor leader Anthony Albanese won the coin toss, and chose to go second, so prime minister Scott Morrison is up first. Cue stump speech. 12.13pm BST The final leaders' debate begins We’re off! “We won’t cut the mics,” Riley says, which may turn out to be a mistake. But he’s promised to wield a whip if the leaders bang on. Anthony Albanese and Scott Morrison shake hands during the third leaders’ debate at Seven Network Studios.

Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP Updated at 12.06pm BST 12.04pm BST For Sunday’s debate, some of us were treated to our first taste of Lego Masters while we waited for it to begin. Tonight it’s Big Brother... I’m watching online from Adelaide and all I have for now is a still of a woman with an enormous deep fried chicken drumstick in her mouth. It appears to be frozen (the feed, not the drumstick). 12.00pm BST Today has all been about wages: about whether a government can do anything to increase your wages, and whether a wage increase will just fuel the inflation that we kinda got a bit used to having at very low levels. Wages are, of course, a key part of tackling the cost-of-living pressures that so many voters are worried about. But expect Albanese to talk about other factors, including childcare and Medicare. And Morrison will spruik his government’s handling of the economy through the pandemic. Housing could be a flashpoint, too. But there are so many other policy fronts that are important for the politicians to discuss, because they’re important to our lives. Will climate change feature? It hasn’t been a large part of the to-and-fro so far. National security almost certainly will, after the Solomon Islands – China security debate introduced new, and more immediate, uncertainty. Defence spending will tie into this. An integrity commission is front of mind for many, particularly as the “teal” candidates are focussing on it. Morrison will insist he’s got a good plan, Labor will say theirs will have more teeth. Personally, I’m hoping for a few curveballs as well. Updated at 12.02pm BST 11.52am BST Albanese and Morrison prepare to square off in third election debate The countdown is on. Ten days left until the election – although people have been voting in rather large numbers since Monday. Prime minister Scott Morrison and Labor leader Anthony Albanese are set to go another few rounds – and we all hope it will be less shouty and more intelligible. And intelligent. As I mentioned below, the Seven News political editor, Mark Riley, will moderate. There’ll be a “pub test” with undecided voters in so-called battleground electorates, having their say on how it’s going. Watch it live on Seven, or don’t – follow it here. It all kicks off at 9.10pm AEST. Updated at 12.06pm BST 10.52am BST Team, let’s take a break before the leaders’ debate begins. It’s a chance for you (and me) to take a nap, pop the corn, don the slippers, pour the whiskey ... or scrub up on the economics of inflation (not really). Tonight’s Great Debate: The Final Showdown begins at 9.10pm, but I’ll be back before that to get things rolling. Amanda Meade wrote today that Seven News political editor, Mark Riley, says he’ll use “a chair and a whip” to control prime minister Scott Morrison and Labor leader Anthony Albanese in the third and final leaders’ debate – and that he will avoid a repeat of Sunday night’s “spectacle”. Here are all the details of tonight’s shenanigans, including how to watch: Related: Mark Riley wants Seven’s election debate to be better than Nine’s Sunday night ‘spectacle’ Updated at 10.58am BST 10.51am BST AAP reports that a Melbourne hospital will be reviewed after an eight-year-old girl reportedly died 21 hours after attending the emergency department with stomach pain. Amrita Varshini Lanka attended the Monash Children’s hospital on 29 April after initially seeing a GP for symptoms including vomiting and a fever, according to the ABC. Initial assessments ruled out appendicitis with nurses instead believing Amrita had gastroenteritis. She developed breathing issues and went into cardiac arrest a few hours later, the ABC reported. The eight-year-old died on the morning of 30 April about 21 hours after she initially presented. Amrita’s death will be examined by the coroner and Safe Care Victoria, the Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, said on Wednesday. Foley said: Until that process is complete it would be terrible for me to say more, other than our deepest sympathies to the family and all those who are involved in what is really a tragic set of circumstances. The premier, Daniel Andrews, said there would also be a full review of Monash Health. Monash Health said it was common practice for a facility to be reviewed if a person dies while in the hospital’s care. It has contacted Amrita’s family to provide support, with her exact cause of death still unknown. A Monash Health official said: This is a very upsetting time for the family, and we offer our sincere condolences to the child’s family and friends. 10.38am BST Embattled Liberal MP Fiona Martin (the one who denies mixing up Asian-Australian Labor candidates) is in more strife. According to the ABC, mental health advocate professor Patrick McGorry says she used him for an “endorsement” without his permission. The former Australian of the Year says Martin selectively used some words from an email he sent her before the election. 10.19am BST Some more context on that polling from The Australian, from Katharine Murphy: Some background on that MRP polling I've just shared. Has been used in the UK, track record is mixed https://t.co/a0VJ4axVik #auspol — Katharine Murphy (@murpharoo) May 11, 2022 10.07am BST The former partner of swimming champion Ian Thorpe, Ryan Channing, has died in Bali. The Sydney Morning Herald reports the Sydney-based 32-year-old, who dated Thorpe for four years to 2019, had Covid eight weeks ago. The paper quotes a Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, who said they were “providing consular assistance to the family of an Australian citizen who died in Bali”. News Corp papers are reporting Channing had been “battling health issues” for some time. 9.56am BST Call for fresh restrictions as WA Covid cases surge “It scares me greatly,” Australian Medical Association WA president, Mark Duncan-Smith, says of the latest surge in Covid infections. AAP reports that the surge in Western Australia has prompted calls for the reintroduction of restrictions amid fears the state’s health system “may get smashed”. WA reported 17,033 new cases on Wednesday, easily the highest number in any state or territory, and a jump of more than 4,600 on the 12,390 reported on Tuesday. Mark McGowan says case numbers in Western Australia are expected to climb but ‘they are way below what was predicted’. Photograph: Trevor Collens/AAP It took active cases across the state to almost 69,000, although the number of people in hospital actually fell slightly to 275. Duncan-Smith said the state’s current infection rates were the equivalent of NSW having more than 50,000 cases a day. He also warned that hospital numbers were likely to rise, given they generally lagged a week behind any spike in infections: Just as it has taken a week for the numbers to go up significantly following the reduced restrictions and dropping the mask mandate, any new public health initiatives will take a week before they have any effect. In that week there is a danger that our medical system may get smashed. “I can see where this is going and it scares me greatly. The AMA boss said the government should reverse its decision to drop indoor mask mandates and should reimpose other restrictions which could flatten the curve. It should also consider delays to elective surgery. Premier Mark McGowan said the government was monitoring the situation: At the moment we have a high case load, but the reality is since yesterday our hospitalisation and intensive care numbers went down,” he told reporters. “We are expecting they will climb, but they are way below what was predicted. Updated at 10.46am BST 9.46am BST Because too many polls are barely enough ... A YouGov poll predicts Labor will win 80 seats, according to The Australian. The Australian calls it “the most sophisticated poll conducted across Australia”, based on a sample size of almost 19,000 voters. The results, if replicated, would mean Labor governing with a majority of five seats, the Coalition left with 63 seats, and one Greens and seven independents making up the rest of the 151 House of Representatives seats.

On Wednesday the sport’s national governing body uncritically shared a Facebook post from ACT Liberal senator Zed Seselja promoting a $4.5m pledge of funding for sporting infrastructure in Canberra. The post, a verbatim reproduction of Seselja’s original post said: A re-elected Liberal Government will deliver $4.5 million to support Capital Football - Official’s Home of Football. The Home of Football in Throsby will support Canberra’s 30,000 strong football community, as well as indoor courts for futsal and basketball. The post was deleted just after 5pm on Wednesday, after attracting more than 80 comments that described it as – among other things – “shocking political advertising”, “deeply disappointing” and “disgraceful”.

The Greens and independent MP Andrew Wilkie are leading the pack. AAP reports: Peak rights and advocacy organisation People with Disability Australia scored them on their election pledges, after sending its election platform a month ago and asking participants to clarify policy positions across seven issues affecting Australians living with disability. The Liberal-National coalition, Labor, the Greens, One Nation, Centre Alliance and independent candidates Andrew Wilkie and Zali Steggall responded. The responses have been used to develop a survey report and scorecard intended to be an easy reference guide for voters. People with Disability Australia has given independent MP Andrew Wilkie and the Greens the ‘thumbs up’ as they have ‘demonstrated clear and worthwhile support of pretty much all the issues’. Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP PWDA president, Samantha Connor, says the Greens and independent Andrew Wilkie “get the most thumbs up from us” as they have “demonstrated clear and worthwhile support of pretty much all the issues”. She said: Their positions in relation to increasing financial security for people with disability and extending the NDIS to people over 65 years of age are of key interest. Labor and independent MP for Mayo, Rebekah Sharkie, came in second. PWDA will continue to advocate on a range of issues affecting people with disability in the lead-up to the election on May 21. Updated at 10.50am BST 7.25am BST Jennett points out that even the government’s own numbers show inflation will keep rising, and asks Ruston is that makes a pay increase of about 4% “almost inevitable”. Ruston says it’s up to the Fair Work Commission to make an informed and independent decision. 7.21am BST The Liberal campaign spokesperson, Anne Ruston, is on the ABC now. Greg Jennett asks her if she’d be comfortable having some of the lowest paid workers get an effective wage cut. She says: Well, of course we want to see all Australian workers get fair pay and we also are happy to see and would like to see Australian – some of our lowest paid workers paid more. But what we won’t do is interfere with the independent processes through which those wage levels are determined. She’s now criticising Albanese for talking about that wage rise, at which point I’ll direct you (again) to Paul Karp’s factcheck on whether it’s “unprecedented” for governments to make submissions to the Fair Work Commission: Related: Factcheck: is Albanese’s backing of a 5.1% minimum wage rise an ‘unprecedented’ intervention? Updated at 7.23am BST 7.16am BST Kelly asks: When does a wage rise become inflationary? Chalmers says: “What matters here is how much productivity you get with these wage increases.” Growing the economy without inflationary pressures and getting the economy going again is the aim, he says. He says businesses who say they’ll have to pass on costs to customers is not good for the local economy. Updated at 7.18am BST 7.13am BST The ABC’s Fran Kelly is quizzing Chalmers on why that wages figure won’t be put in a formal position. Chalmers says Labor’s position is clear: We made that clear and what that means is $1 an hour for Australia’s lowest paid workers. That’s not too much to ask. Many of the workers are the heroes of the pandemic, it’s not too much to ask they get a $1 an hour extra. If the prime minister wants to say an extra $1 an hour for Australia’s low paid workers will break the economy, then the economy is not in the condition he pretends it to be. 7.09am BST Labor’s treasury spokesperson, Jim Chalmers, is talking about leader Anthony Albanese’s pledge to support a 5.1% pay rise. He supports it, he says: That’s because it’s entirely consistent with what we have been arguing for some time now. Which is [that] Australian workers, lowest paid workers in our economy shouldn’t be going backwards during Scott Morrison’s cost-of-living crisis. But he says Labor hasn’t determined a “final position” and won’t commit to putting the figure in a submission to the Fair Work Commission.

Hello all, welcome to the part of the afternoon where we try to imagine the two leaders limbering up for tonight’s debate, while their staffers fire practice questions at them: Forget the lettuce! How much is the wage rise they want? Updated at 5.56am BST 5.51am BST And now I’ll hand you over to the fantastic Tory Shepherd for the remainder of your afternoon. 5.49am BST NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, has ruled out a London-style congestion tax for drivers in Sydney’s city centre, AAP reports. He was responding to a confidential leaked draft transport strategy from February, advising that transport pricing needs to reflect the true cost of using the state’s roads. “Charging for road use at certain locations or times can encourage customers who have flexibility to choose other options,” the document, reported by Nine, says. Perrottet dismissed suggestions of such a tax. He said on Wednesday: There is no plan for a congestion tax and and we can rule it out completely. A congestion tax was introduced in London in 2003, with drivers paying about $25 over a 20km sq radius of the city. Perrottet said the government encouraged its public servants to come up with new ideas and think broadly and ambitiously. Another suggestion was to change public transport fares, which are subsidised, to reflect “the true cost of trips”. The government receives advice yearly from the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal on public transport fares. The premier said: We weigh that up and we make the decision, but I’m a big believer in subsidised public transport ... it’s a great social good. The opposition leader, Chris Minns, is not convinced. He said: I don’t believe that for a second. When it comes to this government’s track record on privatisation, user pays and toll roads you should never believe it when they suggest a congestion charge is not on the way. Updated at 5.51am BST 5.39am BST Labor has been arguing for months that the price of everything has been going up, except your wages. But the debate over the minimum wage really took off on Tuesday when Anthony Albanese endorsed a specific pay rise: 5.1%, to keep up with inflation. Now the government is accusing Labor of policy on the run and an “unprecedented” intervention in an independent wage-setting process. Is that true?

This finally makes it commercially viable for local ship owners to own and operate Australian flagged ships. It means more jobs, a stronger economy, and a safer Australia. The changes announced are equally beneficial for both the primary and international shipping registers. This combination is critical for a country like Australia who is utterly reliant on maritime trade. Maximising the number of Australian ships is in our national interest to ensure we survive and thrive.

Updated at 4.44am BST 4.42am BST Barnaby Joyce finishes on wages, but there are a lot of words and not all of them seem to be in an easily understood order, so the short version is; he is against Anthony Albanese’s argument. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, wraps up his press club address in Canberra Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian Updated at 4.47am BST 4.38am BST Joyce says China will respect strength Q: On the wages increase we know that regional seats incomes are much lower, you probably have more – people more reliant on minimum and award wages in those environments. What is a reasonable wage increase for those people to expect this year, particularly given cost pressures in regional Australia through housing? And secondly, just in your speech you’ve said about China wanting to encircle Australia being the biggest issue, its militarisation being the biggest issue on the ballot paper. You also say we need to understand as a nation how we generate wealth in this country. We do that by selling a heap of iron ore to China. Which gets turned into things like ... warships, submarines. How do you reconcile the tension there between on one hand effectively taking Chinese money for our goods, at the same time potentially arming China, helping arm China? Barnaby Joyce: Well, it’s a vexed issue isn’t it. The thing is, what China will respect is strength. That’s why I say we have to become as strong as possible as quickly as possible. And respecting strength means you have to be strong across all facets of what you do. You have to be strong in agriculture, you have to be strong in mining. You have to be strong in education. You have to understand that people are going to assess the strength of Australia in a holistic form, not just your military. That’s just one section of it. You can’t have a strong military if you don’t have a strong economy. ... You can’t pay for it. So yeah, this is something and that is we believed in the past in a rules based order, we believed in the past that countries just didn’t arbitrarily invade other countries. We believed in the past that people were basically peaceful and won’t be a threat to one another ... And right now – I remember talking to one of the large miners, this goes to show you, the salutary lesson about what’s happening in the world, we were talking about iron ore exports and China, I said we have a big new customer. Big new customer. And I was trying to pick it. I went, Germany. Germany is a big new customer. And I imagine Germany is using the iron ore for a whole range of things and of course one the other Germany is redoing, rearming. That’s the world we live in. Who thought we will be standing in a podium in a press club and talk about this is such as that. Updated at 4.48am BST 4.34am BST Q: The Coalition is said to have a woman problem not just a lack of female representation but a slew of incidents involving Coalition men. Why should the women of Australia vote for the Coalition? Barnaby Joyce: Let’s look at our party. If we had a quota system in the Senate we would need more blokes because it’s 80% women. I’m looking at Kay Hull president of our party and she’s a woman. In the positions that we have – like government positions that we go through the process of selection at cabinet – it’s about 50-50 now in women. We are making sure all the time we do a better job. We had the Jenkins review, to look into these issues regards women and regards bullying. And we have seen issues that all of us can be better. Obviously we have had some unsavoury incidents, and they have to be dealt with. So they don’t happen again. And the Labor party got theirs too. With the Kimberley Kitching issues and things that surround them. All these things, all of us can do better. But we did – and I’ve for my part and trying to make sure we fought so that – so people who had some serious issues in the Parliament could get access to a proper process of investigation of records, so they could prosecute their case. And doing that quietly from the backbench, and then having that unfortunate thing that one of my emails got – one of my emails was leaked by a third person. I can never work out why that’s been utilised for a political point when it was done for such a personal reason to try to help a person. These issues we will continue to work on. And right now with going around with candidates such as Jacinta Price, you know, brilliant Indigenous woman who will add so much to bring forward issues, especially from bush communities, and how we can do a better job there and how we can – we haven’t reached any point where we stop. We have further to go and we continue on. Updated at 4.41am BST 4.32am BST Q: Following a similar theme, would reserve the right to renege on a coalition deal with the Liberal party depending of what guarantees have to be given in a hung parliament, or alternatively, would you seek to have in that coalition agreement a veto over those deals with the crossbench? Barnaby Joyce: These things are hypothetical and I think you open a can of worms when you go down that process. The Nationals obviously, because we are a different party, we negotiate our Coalition agreement with the Liberal, if – and other negotiations I don’t know of, I have no party to, and I will let other people make the decision about it. Updated at 4.39am BST 4.31am BST Q: I want to pick you up on negotiating with independents because the idea put forward is that would lead to chaos in the parliament. I want to go back to February when your own aside were holding up the government’s agenda because of vaccine mandates and your own side, basically, toppled at the religious discrimination bill, so when you are talking about chaos in a parliament, I mean, we have already got it. Barnaby Joyce: No, we have not. Q: You have not been able to get your own agenda three. Joyce: What you are talking about is a singular issue, one issue. If you have got independents, you are going to happen every day. You will not have small iterations, from time to rare and infrequent. It will be a daily thing ... If independents are the way to go, if that is the righteous, proper process for the government of our nation, then let’s have 151 of them. It will be total and utter chaos. Updated at 4.38am BST 4.30am BST Q: Just to follow on that, they don’t know the policy, you mentioned Labor’s housing policy but some of that was incorrect ... You still have outspoken senators voting how they say they are going to vote so what is the difference between negotiating with a teal independent and negotiating with a coalition backbencher? Barnaby Joyce: Well, the difference is the coalition backbencher has said they support a coalition government. When they went to the people, they said, “If you vote for me, I will be supporting the Nationals and the Liberals on supply and confidence and by doing so giving them the capacity that the prime minister elect – to go to the governor general and say, ‘I have got the numbers’. That is a big difference. What teal people do is they say, ‘I am not going to tell you the ...’ And then you say: ‘Hang on... Who am I voting for? I don’t get it. And am I voting for Mr Albanese or Mr Morrison?’ No coalition backbencher has gone to their people before an election and said: ‘Well, although I am in the National party it might be up for grabs.’ Updated at 4.37am BST 4.28am BST Barnaby Joyce: I am getting a sense you are not voting for me. There is a whole range of your question I just don’t agree with, and I think I will deal with ... them one at a time. We have made massive investments in health. We actually negotiated for the Murray Darling Basin medical school. That goes right back to John Andersen when we started expending a capacity in Newcastle. I have been up to Darwin and talking about the expansion of what we are doing a Charles Darwin University. I was in Shepparton in two weeks ago and it was investment in allied health. We have got a doctor in David Gillespie. As I said, we have a regional health minister. The Labor party have a minister for the republic so when we take you to a hospital, our idea is to get your blood pressure down. Theirs is to take a photo of the Queen down. So, this health policy, it is about the movement of doctors in urban areas where we say to you if you work in a regional area, we will take a year off your HECS. If it is a very remote, we will take two years of your HECS. They are not Labor policies ... ... The telehealth process – I spoke to Doctor McPhee who looked after the people of Emerald for in excess of 30 years, making sure that people get access ... Gabby, we put in our negotiations with the Liberal party in excess of about $66m to get new magnetic resonance machines into regional areas so that if someone has cancer we can find out about it soon and get them the treatment and I can go on and on and on, Gabby. We can go and show you how – the expansion of our prescriptions, so when you get prescriptions, you pay less amount of money if you are a pensioner. These are all part of our health policy. Do we have a challenge as we go forward? Yes, we do. I’ll be trying to address it? Yes, we are. Do we have a regional health minister? Yes, we do. Have we seen an alternative from the Labor party or the Greens? No, we have not. On the next issue, we say these things make people unpopular – so many times I read in the paper when I know the polling and I hear something and I go, ‘someone has been fed like a Chook’. They have given them something and they have swallowed it whole. I know the polling of what they have said is not right. Q: So, the polling is wrong? Joyce: What I acknowledge is that, yes, in certain areas where there is a soft vote, especially in urban areas, they want to understand that we have made – the Nationals – have made a commitment with the prime minister and we are sticking to it, right? And that is your answer. Updated at 4.34am BST 4.26am BST Q: It is estimated that is about $4bn that Australia is missing out because of the lack of services and stuff. It is hard to get a GP in rural Australia right now. People are starting to regular book every couple of months to collect their ailments because they can’t get there when they are sick. Telecommunications has been dodgy for a long time and notwithstanding the bit of money that was thrown out in this campaign in response to the regional – rural telecommunications review there has not been a lot of that has been done over the last decade since you have been in government. We are going into an inflationary environment, and people have high exposure to debt because it regional housing prices are running through the roof, rentals are short. I think in one of your local towns, Tamworth, it is about 0.7% is the rental vacancy. Barnaby Joyce: I am with you, Gabrielle. So, a health question and a rental question? Q: No, no. We have got those conditions, right? In the meantime, the thing that you are known for most, right across the country ... Joyce: Johnny Depp’s dogs Q: Well, no. There is something more than that. It is the $100 roast and it is the prosecution of the climate wars, and so, while you have been off on the kind of climate frolic, these traditional services that we need in rural Australia are lost. So, given the recent intervention by your senator Matt Canavan on net zero being ... Joyce: A long question ... I have got a bleeding nose. Q: I have got so many questions. I am told that if the Nats went backwards in all of their seats after Senator can advance intervention. So, haven’t you given those conditions failed on your key KPIs in terms of representing the bush. Updated at 4.31am BST 4.24am BST Q: Can I just pull you. .. up, Labor is matching your safeguard mechanism but effectively, lowering the threshold. Isn’t it the fact that at the moment, you are not actually enforcing the safeguard mechanism so the companies involved with this? Barnaby Joyce: There are exceptional circumstances defining how the baseline works. There are a number of ways you can define how the baseline lease with the point of the ceiling is that it was precisely a ceiling. To stop emissions being let off the hook and going through the roof. That is what it was about. What they have brought in is not a ceiling. They have brought in a cave with a low roof, and this – they are going to keep winding it down and they have not put forward a policy of an alternate industry. We want to develop and alternate industry so that in the future people can make a choice. Updated at 4.29am BST 4.23am BST Q: Mr Joyce, I don’t think it’s remarkable to say your job as National party leader is to win National party seats first, and government second. Some of your Liberal colleagues say they are paying a very high price for the perception that you’re not ambitious enough on climate change. What would you say to those Liberal colleagues and the Coalition voters who vote for them if they end up losing will you be overseeing a Pyrrhic defeat? Barnaby Joyce: A Pyrrhic defeat. No, let’s have a look, our nation is an honourable nation. Why? Because we make agreements and we stick to them*. We have honoured every agreement, right now, Boris Johnson says he wants to take a break from his 2050 target. (*The French would probably say something different.) Germany, Italy are firing up the coal-fired power stations again. There was $35 billion in fossil fuels that the – 35bn euro, sorry, that the European Union bought off Russia in the first week – in the first month of the Ukraine crisis. They only euros of aid into the Ukraine. This is the reality of the world. ... China, which produces half the coal in the world, their last two quarters were records amount. Record. Record production in coal. What our nation does, and what’s so good about us, this is why we are so diligent we make promises and keep to them. We are doing that. So when we do this, we make sure that we nutted out as how we are going to get there, how we keep our economy stable, and right now you are seeing it. We developing an alternate industry. Not a transition, alternate. Our alternate is hydrogen. We invested more or hydrogen through the campaign than the Labor party has. They haven’t even got - our investment in renewables is massively ahead of theirs. So, when it the truth is understood, we are a noble nation who abides by their agreements when other nations are stepping away, and through this campaign, we have invested more in an alternative industry, in the hydrogen industry than at the Labor party which, to be quite honest, I don’t know what alternative industry they are investing in. What they have talked about is in transition and in regional areas transition is read as unemployment. The policy is to reduce the safeguard mechanism. We have a safeguard mechanism. It is like the ceiling on this. It is out of the way but it stopped going through the roof. They are going to bring the ceiling down to about head level for tall people and that is going to be around 213, 215 of them will bolt their heads on the fans and the lights and they will be a new tax placed on them and we can’t have that. We have an honorable position and a logical position. Updated at 4.26am BST 4.19am BST There is a brief interlude while Barnaby Joyce’s nose bleed is addressed. I know you are going to get 1,001 photos of me with a Kleenex to my nose, congratulations. So the alternative is I leave. Barnaby Joyce suffers from a bleeding nose during his address to the National Press Club in Canberra. Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAP Updated at 4.31am BST 4.17am BST Q: The company says it needs an extra $2.5m. To finish that. Barnaby Joyce: That’s the question. You are saying are you going to allocate more money to a business case for a coal-fired power station, not whether you agree with a business case for a coal-fired pow station because there a business case that partially done on a coal-fired power station for Collinsville, now we have to come to the question do we allocate more money to that and that’s a realm much other things we need to consider. Updated at 4.22am BST 4.17am BST Q: Mr Joyce in your speech you said that Labor was being deceitful for saying something in the Hunter Valley, different ... Joyce: I’m still listening. Hold on yes. Keep going ... (His nose is still bleeding.) Q: To what it was saying in the cities – but what we are seeing at the moment is Nationals MPs saying that they support a coal-fired power station in central Queensland, Liberal MPs saying it is never going to happen. We are seeing you say you want more coalmines in the Galilee Basin, Scott Morrison has refused to say that when he was asked at a press conference in this campaign. And we have seen your candidates say that next zero emissions is flexible. Nationals candidates and Liberal MPs say that’s not right. So isn’t it the Coalition being more egregious talking out of both sides of your mouth, given the issues with Liberal MPs facing more climate conscious constituents, does that make the Coalition agreement between the Liberals and Nationals more vulnerable? Joyce: No, don’t you love you get a bleeding nose in a press club. Anyway. No, it doesn’t. Because what we are doing is both the Labor party and ourselves are talking about if there is – we have got to make sure our nation earns as much money as possible. We can’t do that if we shut down coal exports. So what they are saying is completely in line where our policy is. We are saying you have to understand global demand, global demand for coal is a sign that the world is still buying it. If the world doesn’t buy it we won’t be selling in I but they are buying it and buying it in record amounts record prices. Q: Your MPs are saying they support a coal-fired power station in central Queensland, Liberals are saying it is never going to happen. How is that an honest conversation? Joyce: We are undertaken the business case for a coal-fired power station in con That’s the process at foot. Now, whether in how that comes to a conclusion or whether it comes to a conclusion, by reason that we have basically used the money we was allocated to do it, is the discussion, so when you say are we going through the assessment of coal-fired power station and Collinsville, that is actual policy. There is a business case that will be undertaken on that. Barnaby Joyce answers questions from journalists at the Press Club in Canberra this afternoon. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian Updated at 4.22am BST 4.13am BST Barnaby Joyce then starts choking on water. No actually, I think his nose is bleeding. Updated at 4.15am BST 4.12am BST Q: Your government criticised the so-called teal independents for not declaring who they would vote for or support. But if there is a hung Parliament and the teal independents are involved in negotiations with the Coalition, they might call for the Coalition agreement to be made public. Under what circumstances would the Nationals agree to such a request and shouldn’t that agreement be transparent so Australians know what’s in it? Barnaby Joyce: No. Because why? Because in my discussions to get the best deal for regional Australia I don’t want to have to ventilate every iteration, every nuance, day by day within the media. Which go to bat for regional Australia on behalf of the party I’m part of, the Nationals, I’m going to make sure that I don’t sort of fulfil other people’s desires and getting the best outcome for regional people. And so that process – and a lot of the times you find the document rather unremarkable. Q: Why not produce it? Joyce: Well because that’s fulfilling your desire not regional Australia’s desire. So you want a straight answer, the answer is no, I won’t. Q: You have called for teal independents to be transparent. Joyce: I tell what you you will know from me, I am going to support Mr Morrison and the Liberal party to form a government. 100%. I say to the Australian people, if you vote for the Nationals we will work with the Liberals to form government and keep this nation in safe hands. That wasn’t too hard. That was quite easy. So what happens to these independents these righteous people it’s so ridiculous, it’s so implausible, actually it’s the only thing they can tell you that they will do, because they are not actually a minister so they can’t really tell you about policy. They will announce policies but it’s patently absurd for anybody to understand the machinery of government. They are not in cabinet, they are not in the policy construction, they are not in the expenditure review that comes for the money they are not responsible for getting access to the Parliament in how it’s debated in the agenda. So saying these things in the street which they will be doing, you know, I’m going to do this and that and something else, the reality is people got to ask them – how are you going to do that? When are you a cabinet minister, I didn’t know that. You are not even elected and you are already a cabinet minister, congratulations, well done. Feat of brilliance. Then the obvious thing they actually can answer, the one question they can answer, people say, if there was a hung Parliament, I want to know because it’s my vote, am I voting for the Labor Party, which probably has to go to business with the Greens. The Greens are open about it, everyone knows exactly who they are supporting. Or voting with the Nationals and Liberals. You have a right to know that. It’s the most fundamental question you should answer but they don’t. Updated at 4.16am BST 4.10am BST Q: But by making the dentist analogy you are conceding that Scott Morrison’s personal standing is an issue, like everybody’s repeating this dentist analogy and I get it but I’m wondering what’s changed, why do people not like Scott Morrison after electing him three years ago? What’s happened in the past in your view? Barnaby Joyce: It is kind of irrelevant. The premise – the premise is that you say it sways votes in an exceptional manner and I don’t concur with the premise, I don’t believe it does. I believe the Australian people are smarter than that ... If it’s a popularity contest I think you will find politicians in Canberra who are more popular than the prime minister, most certainly more popular than me, more popular than Mr Albanese, more popular than Senator Penny Wong or Katy Gallagher. I don’t know who will be the prime minister, I’m trying to work it out. It could be anybody, it could be George Christensen but he’s gone. Updated at 4.14am BST 4.08am BST Q: I want to ask about popularity. You said it’s not an important attribute for a political leader but I would argue in an election – we are having right now, it’s a contest about character. So what voters think or voters perceive of a leader is important in this contest and it seems a lot of voters have made up their mind about Scott Morrison, the prime minister, and they don’t like him. As a person who studies the polls and gets the polls to the electorate, I’m wondering why do people not like Scott Morrison? What has changed since that miracle victory in 2019, when voters endorsed him as prime minister? Barnaby Joyce: I must be endowed with the gift of proficiency because I actually put that in my speech. I came up with the analogy that you don’t have to like your dentist*. It’s not important. You just have to believe they are competent. (*Katie Allen and numerous Coalition MPs have been using this line for more than a month.) Because when they have got that drill in your mouth, you want to make sure they hit the right tooth. You don’t want it through your tongue or cheek, because they are your mate, competency is what matters. As an accountant I didn’t try to be mates with my clients. I tried to be competent so they could get the best outcome and pay the least amount of tax. When I go to eye mechanic I don’t find out if he’s on one of my besties. I just want them to be able to fix the car and running a nation is more complicated than all those jobs. So the people of Australia, they are not fools. They are making a decision about competency. They are make a decision about vision. They are making a decision about where this nation goes and it is precarious times. We are not making that up. See it on the television, Ukraine, China, inflation, cost of living pressures. You know, people if it’s a popularity contest it will be married at first sight, or my kitchen rules or I’m a celebrity get me out of here, right. It’s not. As far as my relationship with the prime minister goes, every agreement he has honoured. Every one. We are in a business relationship and I’m an accountant. I say when I deal this man, every agreement he honours. I never have to go and relitigate it or say, you know, you are slipping away there it. And that’s what matters to me. So I say that back to the Australian people, that’s what matters to me and that’s what must matter to you.

Before the Reserve Bank of Australia made its decision to raise the official interest rate on 3 May, it was fine for the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, to opine that the central bank should wait to see how wages were faring (on 18 May) before lifting rates. (“Disappointing” was the view of the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers.) But today, it’s “reckless” according to Scott Morrison for Anthony Albanese to make known his preference that the Fair Work Commission lift the minimum wage (now $20.33 an hour) by the inflation rate (5.1% for March CPI, heading higher) to ensure workers don’t go backwards. The seven-member panel (three of which are fair work commissioners) will release its verdict on how much it will lift the minimum wage by late May or early June. Typically, they take into account the five minimum wage objectives of the act, and critically, both the headline and underlying inflation rate. (The latter was running at an annual 3.7% in the March quarter.) For this fiscal year, the FWC raised the minimum wage 2.5% at a time when Covid disruptions were sending odd economic signals. Both the headline and underlying inflation figures were running at an annual rate of 1.1% for the March 2021 quarter that were the most recent figures that the FWC panel had in front of it. Business groups such as the AiGroup and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry are asking for 2.5% to 3% only for the minimum wage increase, saying that a 0.5 percentage point increase in superannuation contributions should be taken into account, and also the benefits of the extended low and middle-income tax offset (LMITO). Jim Stanford, an economist and director of the Centre for Future Work, notes that you can’t use super increases to pay the bills, and also that the LMITO is due to run out after this year. Will businesses call for a wage rise when that offset ends, he asks, adding: “Do we actually think it is the government’s responsibility to subsidise the failure of business to pay a living wage by handing out tax year after year.” And it’s worth noting, from a recent ACTU report, that our minimum wage compared with the median wage has been falling steadily.

Updated at 3.43am BST 3.36am BST Barnaby Joyce speaks at the National Press Club Barnaby Joyce: We know that popularity is not necessarily an attribute of good political leadership. And populism most certainly is not. Popularity is not even indicator who people will vote for. According to the 2019 morning consult survey, Senator Mitch McConnell, a republican from Kentucky had a 15% disapproval rating with registered voters. It’s the second highest under Senator Susan Collins but Senator McConnell won his race by a margin of 20 independence points. The reason was given people prioritise state interests over candidate favourability. Senator McConnell’s democratic challenger campaign was based around not being Senator McConnell and was said to be ineffective because it lacked a clear policy agenda. I think it’s fair to say this election we don’t want people to vote for the Coalition because they think we are popular or I am popular. Instead we want people to vote for us because we are strong, know where we are going, can make hard decisions to get there and we can back hard decisions by showing you how we are going to pay for it. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, at the National Press Club in Canberra this afternoon. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian Updated at 4.00am BST 3.33am BST Independents Zali Steggall and Helen Haines say establishing an integrity commission that can retrospectively look at corruption is an “incredibly important” issue for them ahead of any negotiations with the major parties in a hung parliament. Steggall and Haines have just concluded a panel discussion organised by the Australia Institute specifically on integrity matters. Both outlined the key features they want from a federal integrity commission - public hearings, public reporting, the ability to take public referrals, a broader definition of corrupt conduct, and retrospectivity. All of those features were contained in the integrity commission bill Haines previously put to parliament. Asked about whether she would insist on retrospectivity in any post-election negotiations with the major parties, Steggall said: I think retrospectivity is incredibly important because we have to be realistic. Over the past four years there’s been some $55bn worth of public funds that have not been allocated on best public interest priorities. So I think retrospectivity has to happen if we want to raise the bar and increase trust in government. That will impact all sides, but it also creates a deterrence again for future governments so they don’t always think this is a problem for the future, that their past conduct is never up for review. On retrospectivity, Haines said: If we’re trying to shine a light on possible corruption, then we need to be able to look backwards, as well as forwards, to find patterns of behaviour. So it is incredibly important. Again, if we’re going to design an integrity commission, we need to design one that works, and one that has the features required. Both independents hit out at Scott Morrison’s criticisms of the New South Wales independent commission against corruption. Haines said Morrison was in “dangerous territory” and behaving recklessly in his criticisms of the body. Both Steggall and Haines also called for Labor to give more detail on their proposal for an integrity commission, saying the two-page set of principles released so far is not enough. Haines said she would need to see “detailed legislation” before offering support to Labor. I don’t make decisions on a set of broad principles. Any piece of legislation, I need to see the detail and understand that and work closely with whomever is the attorney-general to ensure its model is fit for purpose. Steggall said she was “very disappointed” with Anthony Albanese’s approach and recent comments about how Labor would proceed with an integrity commission. In opposition, they have sided with the crossbench and they have relied on I would say Helen and I on a number of issues to really push the government to do better. Now, what he’s saying is look, ‘whilst we’ve supported those models in the past... if we form government we might just look at it and see how else we’ll do it’. With respect, it’s just not good enough. We have models ready to go. The Australia Institute also released polling showing three in four Australians believe integrity issues are more important or equally important as they were at the last election. Updated at 3.37am BST 3.32am BST Barnaby Joyce is delivering the National Press Club today. Marise Payne and Penny Wong will debate each other this Friday. Anthony Albanese will appear next Wednesday. Scott Morrison has not accepted an invitation as yet. 3.30am BST The view from Murph Hello good people. If you are plugged in to the hustings today you’ll know the conversation is about wages. Yesterday, Anthony Albanese said he would support a wage increase for Australia’s lowest paid workers that would keep pace with inflation. It’s a simple message, Labor favours real wage increases, not real wage cuts – although it was strange that the Labor leader seemed to suggest in an early radio interview on Tuesday the level of increase was broadly up to the ACTU but then warmed up to an increase of 5% at a press conference later in the day. Scott Morrison has a more complicated position on this issue. Sorry – I should be clearer, the prime minister has a very simple political message, which is that Albanese is an idiot who will crash the economy, a message that is shared on high rotation regardless of the specifics or merits of any proposal. But back to the substance of the thing. Morrison says the political class shouldn’t have views about wage fixation because the Fair Work Commission (FWC) is independent from government and that independence must be respected. But in the same breath, he also suggests a 5% increase will make the sky fall in – a point that very obviously undercuts his first argument. If the PM genuinely believes politicians should have no views about wages and leave this all to the FWC, then best to maintain that view, lest one be seen as trying to influence a process Morrison says politicians shouldn’t influence. Scott Morrison has a simple message, that Anthony Albanese will crash the economy, regardless of the merits of any proposal. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/EPA Just a couple of general observations. I am old enough to remember the inflationary pressure that existed in the economy before the inflation dragon was allegedly slain. So I remember the old debates where business and other institutional interests in the economy screamed blue murder about giving employees a wage increase because that would feed inflation and help jack up interest rates – which was a narrative Australians became conditioned to accept. I even remember the Accord – a compact between the Hawke government and the union movement where trade unions agreed to temper wage demands in return for a full court press by the government to control inflation. I studied these developments in high school economics, before spending the opening years of my journalism career at the Australian Financial Review, where these issues were covered minutely. But given inflation has not been a risk for governments or central banks to manage for years, there will be many Australians who don’t remember the olden times and will not have been conditioned by those debates in the way that GenXers like myself, and the Boomers before us, were. It’s very obvious Morrison is trying to summon an old school debate on this question, and his efforts will be backed in by the same business groups that have always preferred higher profits and dividends than employee compensation. And of course, substantively, it is important to factor in the inflationary pressure associated with wage increases otherwise better compensation becomes zero sum – what goes in one pocket comes out the other. But I wonder whether Morrison’s political pearl-clutching about inflation has the same potency for a generation that has never experienced inflation, subsists in a gig economy with next to no employment certainty, and has zero prospect of ever owning their own home unless they have access to the bank of mum and dad. The workers of the present generation have only ever known sluggish wages growth. I suspect a simpler Albanese message, that we favour real wages growth, is both salient, and easier to communicate. But Morrison cranking up the inflation dragon, backed by his amplifiers and institutional interests, is obviously a real and present threat for the Labor campaign to manage.

His global special humanitarian visa was revoked in 2017 after he was convicted of assault in Victoria. He is now on Christmas Island seeking to avoid deportation. His lawyers argued he should not be sent back to South Sudan because he belongs to a minority tribe that killed his father and he would be tortured or killed if he had to return. Australia has international obligations not to endanger refugees by sending them back to countries where they could face persecution, torture or death. Despite the refugee’s appeals, in 2018 immigration authorities refused to revoke his visa cancellation. They ruled that he could apply for a protection visa, at which time Australia’s international obligations to refugees could be fully considered. In a judgment on Wednesday, the high court found immigration authorities had evaluated the refugee’s concerns about being sent back to South Sudan and he had not been denied procedural fairness. Updated at 3.22am BST 2.58am BST The press conference ends. Updated at 3.02am BST 2.57am BST Q: On that, on that point the prime minister says you are a loose unit and that your head flips open and stuff just falls out. What do you say to that? Anthony Albanese: Well, this prime minister is loose with the truth. He’s loose with the truth about his analysis of his opponents, but he’s loose with the truth for those people who have worked closely with him as well. This is a guy who the deputy prime minister said, the more you get to know him the less trustworthy, and the more he bends the truth. The fact is that he thinks that – so does the former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. So do so many – so many people who have worked closely with him. I tell you the difference between me and I will conclude with this – the difference between me and Scott Morrison is that those people who have worked with me the closest for the longest are my closest friends and strongest supporters. This guy – this guy cuts people loose, is what he does. Which is why we are here in the electorate of North Sydney, during a federal election campaign – because people who have values, who have traditionally supported the Liberal party, are walking away from the most divisive prime minister in modern history. This is a guy who never looks to bring people together, who never looks for unity, is always just looking for wedges and always looking for division. Australia can be better. I want to bring business and unions together, large businesses and unions. I want to bring small business and their employees together. I want to work with all of the state premiers and chief ministers and bring them together. Australians have conflict fatigue. They have been through two really tough years and we have a prime minister whose incapable of doing what’s needed to take Australia forward. Thanks very much. Updated at 3.04am BST 2.53am BST Q: Further on that question, are you saying – in response to your answer yesterday – you are saying that logically, wage increases should be tied to inflation? Because that’s what you seem to be suggesting. Anthony Albanese: No, I’m not saying that. I’m saying that people on the minimum wage right now, right now – and I gave a speech last Thursday, I know some of you were at the lunch, but if you go back and have a look at the speech, what it spoke about was productivity as being the key. What it spoke about was bringing unions and business together for common interest to work together on that common interest. To grow productivity ... you can have wages increase and profits increase whilst not putting inflationary pressure [on] ... And that was the centre of my speech to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry last Thursday, that’s my position. But ... when people at the moment, when there is no childcare relief, when there’s nothing happening on the social wage, when there’s nothing happening at all to alleviate people’s concerns at a time when – if the Fair Work Commission, which makes these decisions independently of government, makes that decision, that people shouldn’t get a real wage cut, would I welcome it? Absolutely. Q: But Mr Albanese, on that logic you are suggesting that OK, people right now are suffering, they are not seeing their wages increase, if there was an increase of 5.1% you would welcome that. By that logic if inflation goes up to 6% next year ... Albanese: That’s not logic. Q: ... isn’t that the same situation. Albanese: No, we have a – I have just gone through and it I don’t think you were there last Thursday but I encourage you to go read the speech. Q: I watched it in the office, it was a great speech. Albanese: Thank you very much. Thank you for that endorsement. I’m glad you watched. But what it spoke about was how you get wage growth and profit growth, it is something that without putting inflationary pressure on. And we did that - this isn’t in the absence of debates and discussions I’ve had with the business community, with the union movement, I’ve said we will convene a full employment summit. A full employment summit. And that - part of that agenda will be about how we improve economic growth, how about we improve it in a way that deals with inflationary pressures which is there, and we get win-wins. It’s been possible in the past. The problem for this government is they don’t have plans, all they have is arguments and criticisms. And at the moment we have a circumstance whereby this debate specifically is about whether people who are on far less than anyone in this press conference, far less. These are people who are earning $20.33 an hour, whether they should get $1 more. ... I’m the Labor leader but I’m amazed that this is not a bipartisan issue because this is a government that had been prepared to go back, did a budget just a short while ago, whereby they made changes to petrol, they gave a $250 handout, they did all of this cost of living relief, saying there was a cost of living crisis. Well, there is a cost of living crisis, people are doing it tough and that is why there needs to be action. Updated at 3.05am BST 2.50am BST Q: What do you think the rate of inflation will be in a year’s time under Labor? Anthony Albanese: That’s a question for economists. The idea that ... Q: It’s a question for a prime minister. Albanese: No, the idea that anyone could predict what the rate of inflation was a year ago now is of course a triumph of hope over experience. Updated at 2.55am BST 2.48am BST Albanese says Labor is 'underpromising, so that we overdeliver' Q: Is it wrong to link ... minimum wage rises to CPI? And there was a question you were asked before by one of the women chatting about parenthood, why won’t Labor take adding superannuation to Paid Parental Leave to this election? Anthony Albanese: Because I have said I would like to do that, it’s something that would be a positive move. But one of the things we are doing at this election is underpromising, so that we overdeliver. We are in a position whereby we have a trillion dollars of debt, so we are not promising to do everything that we would like to do in our first term. And so I have made it clear would that be a good thing? Yes. Are we in a position to promise things that might be difficult to deliver, no. We are being very clear and very up front. One of the things I’ve done during this campaign is that I speak about polling day, which we now know is May 21 but I also speak about the next election in three years time. And I want to be in a position whereby I say, we said we will deliver cheaper childcare, and it’s happen we said we would address cost of living and we are doing that. We said we would make more things here and it’s happening. We said we would be addressing climate change, and it’s happening. We are seeing that private sector investment in renewables. In renewables. Updated at 3.08am BST 2.47am BST Q: On the conversation we are having right now, yesterday the question to you was would you support wage hikes of at least 5.1%. To which you said “absolutely”. So, is that – were you saying absolutely to minimum ... Anthony Albanese: That wasn’t what the question said. No, the question was – it went to, you don’t want people to go backwards, does that mean you would support a wage hike of 5% [5.1%] just to keep up with inflation. My answer ... was absolutely, and I stand by it. Updated at 2.50am BST 2.46am BST Q: On the debate if I can. Are you looking forward to it? What can we expect? Do we need a whip and a chair? Anthony Albanese: I am looking forward to it. The last debate was pretty rigorous. It’s fair to say. And it should, of course – there should be some rigour because we are talking about important issues. It’s an opportunity for me tonight to further outline our plan for a better future. The big issue in this election campaign is cost of living. Is cost of living. And whether people are left behind or whether people are held back. But it’s about other things as well. It’s about a plan for the future. On Sunday night the prime minister put forward no plan for the present let alone one for future. We have plans like childcare reform that will boost the economy, that will boost productivity. And I want to talk about that tonight. I want to talk about a future made here in Australia. I want to talk about more secure work. I want to talk about addressing the cost of living challenges. I want to talk about the opportunity that’s there from acting on climate change. We need more than just three more years of the same. That is what we need. Updated at 2.49am BST 2.43am BST Q: On the detail of the Fair Work Commission process, you still have time to put in a submission, you said yesterday Labor won’t do that. Anthony Albanese: I think the Fair Work Commission are probably clear about what our view is on those issues. Q: I haven’t finished. I just want to ask the – Albanese: You want a second question. Other journalists chime in, saying: “She hasn’t finished her question.” Q: On the detail will you put forward explicitly 5.1% in Labor’s proposal. Albanese: Well, if I was doing that, then that would be an announcement. But I think it’s very clear. ... No, it’s very clear what our view is. And I think the Commission probably have heard that. Q: Absolutely, that was the word you used. Albanese: Yes, and I stand by that. Updated at 2.47am BST 2.41am BST Q: In the last election Labor made a virtue of the fact that you announced your final costings earlier in the campaign. Didn’t keep it to the last minute. This time you appear to be doing the opposite. Isn’t that treating voters like mugs? No detail until the very end of the campaign when a lot of people probably don’t have time to think it through carefully. Anthony Albanese: We are - we will announce all of our costings in the usual way like oppositions always have. Q: Last time you criticised the government for leaving it too late. Albanese: Did I? Q: Labor did. Albanese: Did I? Q: Labor did. Why won’t you answer the question? Albanese: Well, I’ve answered the question. We will release our costing in the usual way as oppositions have. Updated at 2.45am BST 2.39am BST Q: You said earlier today it was nonsense that a wage hike to the minimum wage to 5.1% would be inflationary or drive up interest rates. How can you make that promise, given interest rates are set by the RBA? And can you guarantee that homeowners across Australia will not be paying more on their mortgage rate? Anthony Albanese: The Reserve Bank had been saying for a long period of time that one of the handbrakes on our economy has been wages. The Reserve Bank governor has been talking about this for just about every major speech that he has been giving. For a long period of time. And my comments are perfectly consistent with that. Updated at 2.44am BST 2.38am BST Q: Just on increasing the minimum wage by 5.1%, do you accept there will broader implications with that? It applies not just to those earning the lowest wages in the country, but also those on EBAs, it applies to penalty rates and could wind up costing employers a whole lot more. Anthony Albanese: Enterprise bargaining agreements of course are separate from the minimum wage. There are linkages – we do not have centralised wage fixation in country. What we have is a series of wage cases, including the minimum wage case which is under way at the moment. Q: You say that you don’t want people going backwards, would you say that you want wages to be pinned to CPI? Albanese: When I was asked would I welcome wages for minimum wages, keeping up with the cost of living, I answered yes. Because I would. Because that is what we’ve been arguing on. We have ads on the TV. We have ads on the TV at the moment talking about this, we’ve had them throughout the campaign and you know what, I find it astonishing, I find it astonishing that a prime minister ... is presiding over a circumstance whereby punters who go up to the local shops here are paying extra for their meat and veggies, they are paying extra for petrol and extra for childcare, they are paying extra for all costs of living, all the costs of living. ... Those people on the minimum wage, what we are talking about here? Who are we talking about? We are talking about cleaners, we are talking about retail workers. We are talking about people really struggling to get by. It’s not enough. It is not enough to say – it is not enough to say “thank you for what you did getting us through the pandemic”, and then saying “we want to cut your real wage”. That is what Scott Morrison is saying. Updated at 2.52am BST 2.36am BST Anthony Albanese calls for order with the press pack when everyone starts talking at once. Order! When you finish I will give someone the call. Q: Next year, if inflation rises by 7% would you advocate for a wage hike of 7%? Albanese: What we are talking about here is a circumstance whereby people have been going backwards. During this campaign we have made it very clear that people are being left behind on this government’s watch, that the cost of everything is going up. The cost of everything is going up but people’s wages aren’t. Q: If you are in government will your submission to the Fair Work Commission recommend a 5.1% wage increase, and if not, have you jumped the gun on this? Albanese: Not at all. We have been running ... a campaign every day of this campaign about cost of living. And one of the themes of our campaign including at the campaign launch was – no one left behind. What we are talking about here is the circumstances right now where people are doing it really tough, they are on $20.33 an hour. $20.33 an hour. Those people will not benefit from any of the tax cuts that will come in. They are on $20.33 an hour. The cost of everything that they buy is going up but their wages aren’t. Scott Morrison – Scott Morrison says that that’s OK. And when I raised – when I raised it in the debate on Channel Nine on Sunday night, I got two questions to the prime minister, I prioritised. The issue of, should Australians be paid at least the minimum wage? He couldn’t even agree to that. Updated at 2.41am BST 2.33am BST Last year, the Fair Work Commission’s decision to raise the minimum wage by 2.5% meant an increase of $0.49 an hour. Updated at 2.35am BST 2.32am BST Anthony Albanese pushes back against Scott Morrison wage attack Anthony Albanese is talking childcare with Amanda Rishworth in North Sydney – but he really wants to talk about Scott Morrison’s attacks on wage growth: I note that Scott Morrison is once again being loose with the truth. What we are talking about here is the lowest paid workers in Australia. Those people who are really struggling with cost of living increases. What Scott Morrison says is that it is OK to find $30 million for a block of land that is worth $3 million. It is OK his government can always find money for sports rorts, for commuter car park rorts, for all of this activity, but he is OK to waste those billions of dollars. A billion dollars literally on advertising of the government itself. But backing a $1 an hour pay increase is not OK. Workers who are paid $20.33 an hour to be paid $1 extra – that is what this debate is about. Scott Morrison has made a conscious decision over the last decade of driving down wages. They say it is a key feature of their economic architecture and they have indeed achieved that.

Govt just sold $400m, to be repaid in 2051, at an interest rate 3.83%. A month ago, the interest rate on 2051 was 3.21%. That's a 19% increase in cost in six weeks... — Shane Wright (@swrighteconomy) May 11, 2022 2.08am BST Earlier this week we had ANZ’s weekly snapshot of consumer sentiment showing a modest drop. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute’s monthly survey, though, is revealing a sharper dive in shoppers’ moods. The latter survey collected the views of 1200 respondents over five days that took in the RBA’s first rate rise (a surprisingly big one) in 11 years, and also the shock annual 5.1% CPI rise during the March quarter. The WMI index slumped 5.6% to 90.4 for the month, and is at the lowest level since August 2020. Excluding the Covid distortions – which seem to have evaporated – the dive is the most since June 2015. That coincided with global market turmoil, which seems to be creeping back in now too. @Westpac-Melbourne Institute's monthly Index of Consumer Sentiment dived 5.6% to 90.4 in May to the lowest level in 21 months. Excluding Covid, it's the biggest drop in 7 years, with rates, cost of living rises to blame. #auspol #ausvotes #ausvotes2022 pic.twitter.com/bxgQBOlmUi — Peter Hannam (@p_hannam) May 11, 2022 Westpac blamed the recent drop on the combination of rising cost of living pressures and the prospect of rising interest rates. Still, actual spending is much more buoyant over 2022 to date, as households respond to the reopening of the economy. While headline inflation pressures may ease from this point, consumers are aware that the Reserve Bank plans to continue increasing the cash rate for some time. Our May survey found 77% of respondents expect mortgage interest rates to rise over the next 12 months, up from 70% last month. But it is even more significant that 52% expect rates to rise by more than 1%, up from just 34% only one month ago. Updated at 2.19am BST 2.06am BST Labor’s candidate for Reid, Sally Sitou, has asked for an apology from the Liberal member for Reid, Dr Fiona Martin, over an assertion Martin made during a radio debate between the pair: Earlier today in a candidates’ debate, my opponent Fiona Martin accused me of having previously contested preselection in Fowler. I have never sought to run for Fowler. I live in Reid, my son goes to school in Reid, and I am excited by the opportunity to represent my community. — Sally Sitou 陈莎莉 - Labor for Reid (@SallySitou) May 11, 2022 My opponent either has me confused for a different Asian-Australian, or she is deliberately misleading people. Either way, she should apologise. — Sally Sitou 陈莎莉 - Labor for Reid (@SallySitou) May 11, 2022 Updated at 2.16am BST 1.56am BST Scott Morrison has spent most of this campaign poo-pooing Anthony Albanese’s “increase wages” line by saying he “doesn’t have a magic pen/wand” to raise wages, and is making a promise he has no influence over. Since the RBA lifted the official cash rate, Morrison has made it clear he does not believe the government has any impact on interest rate rises. Governments make submissions to the Fair Work Commission as part of the process, about what it believes needs to happen with the minimum wage. Last year, the government submitted the FWC should “take a cautious approach” to raising the minimum wage. According to Morrison this week, not only does Albanese’s opinion have the power to influence things Albanese writing a letter as prime minister apparently didn’t have any influence over, it will also lead to higher interest rates. But at the same time, Morrison does not have an opinion on an independent process. Except his opinion on what Albanese’s opinion could do. The PM is prepared to say a 5% wage rise is too high (ie: an increase that keeps pace with inflation) but he’s not prepared to specify what his preferred number is #auspol — Katharine Murphy (@murpharoo) May 11, 2022 The PM says there’s an independent FWC process to respect. Well .. if you respect an independent process, best not to have a view on any number, right? — Katharine Murphy (@murpharoo) May 11, 2022 Of course this is logic. Not politics #auspol — Katharine Murphy (@murpharoo) May 11, 2022 Updated at 2.04am BST 1.47am BST The press conference ends. 1.46am BST Q: Why haven’t you disendorsed your candidate for Lilley? Scott Morrison: Those matters are – sorry, did you say the candidate for Labor? Sorry, I thought you said the candidate for Labor. I was going to say that has nothing to do with me. Those matters are working their way through with the relevant authorities there and people are cooperating fully with those matters and I would expect them to do that. But ultimately – and I will leave you on this – this is a choice, as I say every single day. And it’s the responsible choice, the responsible choice at a time of great upheaval globally, with our economy, with international security, the responsible choice is for the Liberals and the Nationals – I’m just finishing up – The Liberals and Nationals is the responsible choice when it comes to the economy, and national security. With Labor you just don’t know what’s going to pop into Anthony Albanese’s head any day and what he will blurt out and what that will mean for your interest rates, for your cost of living, and indeed Australia’s national security. Thanks very much everyone. Updated at 1.49am BST 1.45am BST Q: If you win government but Josh Frydenberg loses his seat, who will be the next treasurer? Scott Morrison: That’s not something I’m speculating on because I know Josh will be returned. Q: Isn’t it hypocritical you attack Labor for not confirming who the defence minister will be but, if the polls are accurate, Josh Frydenberg will not be treasurer [after the election]? Morrison: You know my view about the polls. Josh Frydenberg will the treasurer. I still don’t know who Anthony Albanese’s defence minister is going to be, I don’t know who his home affairs minister is going to be. [Do you know who will be your treasurer?] Morrison: Yes, it is Josh Frydenberg. Updated at 1.49am BST 1.43am BST Q: What personal would you be comfortable with then given all of the fact that you have just mentioned, or is it just no dice on a real wage rise. Scott Morrison: The figure I have always been comfortable with, and that is what is calmly determined, sensibly, by the independent process that looks at all of these factors. That’s - that’s what discipline is. That’s what financial discipline works. Now, as you know, we have... Q: [ The government makes a submission to FWC, so how can ou say it is wrong for any politician to suggest any increase when you go to fair work.] Morrison: As you know that’s never been our government’s policy and nor was it the previous government’s policy as you recall. Because what... Q: If Fair Work come up with 5.1% are they wrong? Morrison: I’m not speculating about what Fair Work is going to say. Anthony Albanese is the one who was recklessly making comments in this area, and he doesn’t seem to understand. So you know, when you’ve been a Treasurer for three years and a prime Minister for four years, you understand that careless speculation can lead to real world impacts in the economy. You don’t get - you don’t get the latitude to be loose like Mr Albanese was yesterday. And that shows that he’s not up to the job, the job is bigger than him, he doesn’t understand the economy and if that’s not true he is seeking to take you for a ride. 1.40am BST Q: The RBA has said that real wages won’t increase until the end of 2023, with unemployment reaching almost full employment in that time and businesses only just starting to offer wage rises, what are Australians supposed to do in the next 18 months when the RBA is saying that real wages won’t increase in that time, how do they pay for things? Scott Morrison: They won’t be able to pay for things if inflation goes even higher and interest rates go even higher. That is why what Anthony Albanese is speculating on and running off at the mouth on, would only make that situation worse. It would only make it worse. Labor would make the very issues you’re highlighting worse under what they are proposing. (A journalist repeats the question.) Q: Is it correct to say then that you – any workers will not see a real wage increase until that inflation number comes down? And would your government do anything to ... look at trying to ease those global factors that you keep saying are causing Australia’s higher inflation level, particularly around supply chains? If you say there’s an independent wage setting process, and you want to respect that, perhaps you are a loose unit if you nominate any particular number as being too high. Almost like you might be seeking to influence an independent process #auspol — Katharine Murphy (@murpharoo) May 11, 2022 Morrison: ... There are two things driving those inflation numbers at the moment. One is, of course, what’s happening with the – there’s a range of immediate factors. Let’s call them that. There is the war in the Ukraine, there is the shutdown in China because of Covid, and also we will continue to see, particularly this quarter, and perhaps the next quarter, the impact of the floods in Australia and what that means for fruit and veg prices and we have seen that when there is cyclones and other disasters in parts of the country in the past. That will put pressure on prices. And they are things that occur well outside Australia’s control. The structural factors that are driving inflation are about those supply chain pressures that we are seeing which is a lag and a direct consequence of the pandemic. And that’s why what we are talking about here, advanced manufacturing, linking up supply chain in Australia, critical supply chain work, whether it be in the critical rare earth minerals and so on – that’s what helps moving the supply chain efficiently. On top of that, it’s ensuring that we keep getting people into jobs, keep that pressure in the system, which leads to sustainable wage rises, supported by businesses that stay in business. I mean, this is one of the most difficult times with the pressures that are on the global economy and hence the Australian economy, that we have seen in a very long time. And how we manage that must be sensitive, must be responsible, must be disciplined. Now, what we saw yesterday from Mr Anthony Albanese, what we saw yesterday from Mr Albanese was loose. It was ill-considered. It showed a lack of understanding of the relationship between wages and inflation, and interest rates. If you want your interest rates to be skyrocketing, as a result of what Anthony Albanese is suggesting, well, he’s your guy. But what I’m saying, is Anthony Albanese will make it worse. Updated at 1.47am BST 1.35am BST Q: Prime Minister, today you are quoted as saying that it is economic vandalism ... Scott Morrison: I didn’t say that. Q: I want to confirm that, do you think it is vandalism ... Morrison: I didn’t say that. Q: You are not calling him a vandal? Morrison: I didn’t. That is a misquote in the paper. They were not my words. Q: What is wrong with asking for a pay rise? Morrison: There is nothing wrong with asking for a pay rise but, obviously, it – and the Reserve Bank governor has said very clearly, that is what we are seeing in our economy, and the reason we are seeing that is because unemployment is coming down and businesses are growing and becoming stronger. That is where pay rises come from. They come from businesses doing well*, not being shut down by reckless policy, by a Labor party that would see not only your interest rates go up more than they might otherwise do, or your cost of living go up even more, getting into a vicious spiral, going up and up and up. What is he next proposing, if it goes to 6% they have to go by that and when that pushes it up to 7%, they go by that? That is how we ended up with 18% interest rates in this country under Labor. That is what causes the worst of all outcomes, which is a crash in the economy. That is not responsible. *Wage growth was stagnant before the pandemic in Australia. Updated at 1.36am BST 1.32am BST Q: If you say that 5.1% for the minimum wage is a crazy pay rise and you think is a terrible idea – given the government has said it wants to see people earn more, what would be a more sensible minimum pay rise? And please don’t say the Fair Work Commission decides this or businesses determine wages. We have heard that from you before. You are attacking Albanese for what he is saying, what is your alternative, sensible solution and that you propose is 5.1% is too high? Scott Morrison: An independent process that carefully calibrates and considers all the things in the economy that is sustainable. Q: You are attacking Anthony Albanese ... Morrison: I am attacking him for being thoughtless and not having a clue about the economy and not understanding how the economy works and not respecting the process of an independent setting of minimum wage conditions in this country and I will tell you why that is important, small businesses, businesses around the country have to make decisions about how they invest, how many people they employ. They don’t want these things set by some erratic statement of a politician. They want this stuff to be carefully considered. Mr Albanese showed yesterday that he is a complete loose unit on this stuff. He just runs off at the mouth. It is like he just unzips his head and lets everything fall on the table. That is no way to run an economy because that only leads, if you vote Labor, to having a leader who can make interest rates worse, who can make inflation worse. Updated at 1.35am BST 1.30am BST Q: If you don’t support a wage increase of 5.1%, are you OK, comfortable with some of Australia’s lowest paid workers essentially getting a real wage cut? Scott Morrison: The Fair Work Commission is the appropriate body to look at all of the economic implications for where they set the minimum wage. If we wanted politicians to make this up, that is what we would have done. That is not wise. In the same way the Reserve Bank goes and works out what interest rates should be and looks at all the various information and all the implications for the decisions they have to make, this is a very similar process. It provides certainty, it provides stability in the management of our economy. It is not a place where you will see the thought bubbles we saw from Anthony Albanese yesterday and they will think through because this is the end game of what Anthony Albanese says. He will say “Here is a 5.1% increase in your wages”, but then “Here is the interest rates you have to pay”, and “Here is the cost of living that it causes”. He pretends to give with one hand and then he sees interest rates and cost of living rises take it all back from you. Q: You are comfortable with some of Australia’s lowest paid workers getting a real wage cut? Morrison: What I am saying is you need to balance all these things very carefully. That is what responsible economic management is. These are complex issues. What is the point of allowing someone to be put in a position where they are paying more and more, even more as a result of the inflationary impacts of what he was saying yesterday, let alone the impacts on interest rates which already have great pressure on them. This would only see interest rates rise even higher. Is there any wonder that why, when Labor gets into power, that we see a deterioration around these things because they just don’t think about it. There is a reason why Anthony Albanese was never given a financial portfolio by ... Q: But ... Morrison: I haven’t finished. Hasn’t been given a financial portfolio by any of the Labor leaders in the past. They knew he couldn’t be trusted with money. He is like someone working in a small business who they won’t let near the till, and the Australian people shouldn’t let him near the till. Updated at 1.34am BST 1.25am BST It was only Monday that Scott Morrison was saying: There’s no magic pen from Anthony Albanese that makes your wages go up. But today apparently, Morrison believes Albanese has the power to destroy the economy with just an opinion on what the minimum wage rise should be. 1.22am BST We will hear a lot more about this in the answers: Scott Morrison: What he said yesterday puts a chain reaction in place – dominoes fall that lead to higher interest rates and higher cost of living. If he doesn’t understand that ... that tells you everything you need to know about what he doesn’t understand about the Australian economy. If he does understand it, he’s playing you for a mug. He thinks he can run around at this election saying he can increase peoples’ wages and at the same time, see cost of living pressures fall and pressure on interest rates to remain down. It just doesn’t work like that, you either don’t know what you are talking about and you are not up to the job, or you are taking the Australian people for a ride and I have called you out, Anthony. Updated at 1.23am BST 1.20am BST 'What we saw from Anthony Albanese yesterday was reckless,' says Scott Morrison But Scott Morrison really wants to talk about Anthony Albanese: What we saw from Anthony Albanese yesterday was reckless. It was incredibly reckless. We all want to see wages go up, and indeed, the Reserve Bank governor has made it very clear that we are seeing wages starting to go up, but the way you engage in economic policy is not in the loose way we saw from Anthony Albanese yesterday. Anthony Albanese is a loose unit on the economy. We saw that right at the start of the campaign. He didn’t know what unemployment was. He didn’t know what the cash rate was. He says his policies are costed but they’re not costed. When it comes to what he said yesterday, ill thought through, not understanding the potential consequences of what he was saying. Yesterday, in what he said yesterday, it is like throwing fuel on the fire of rising interest rates and rising cost of living. He has had a lot to say about cost of living. He has got no solutions or policies to put downward pressure on it and what he did yesterday would only exacerbate it, it would only make the problem worse. Anthony Albanese’s intervention yesterday and his thoughtlessness on this would actually make inflation worse, it would make interest rates rise even higher, it would threaten the strong growth we have had in employment and, ultimately, it would force small businesses, potentially out of business altogether.

This is a government, in our government, that is investing in the things that ensures the Australian economy can grow, and it is investing in the people, it is investing in their ideas, it is investing in their collaboration and their partnerships because that is what turns things around, that’s what creates the opportunity. Australia is coming out of this pandemic stronger than all of the advanced economies in the world and the G7. We have stronger economic growth, we have an outstanding world class health system, an outstanding world class education system – and what we’re building in the collaboration here between our universities and our companies will enable them to take advantage of the economic opportunities that Australia has in the years ahead. One of the biggest beneficiaries of that will be regional Australia – regions like right here in the Hunter. Updated at 1.19am BST 1.09am BST Three weeks ago, we looked here at the challenges facing the Australian Electoral Commission in trying to recruit more than 100,000 employees at a time when the jobless rate was at about a 50-year low. We’ll get the ABS’s April labour figures on 19 May, two days before the polls close, and a day after the March quarter wage price index data drops. That will tell us a bit more about how tight the jobs market is. The AEC tells us the recruitment for AEC temporary election staff across the country “is going extremely well”. A spokesperson said: With approximately 105,000 staffing positions we’ve had more than 200,000 people who’ve registered their interest which is fantastic. That said, in some regional centres the AEC is competing against other industries such as mining and presumably seasonal farm workers. And there’s the challenge of ensuring some back-up recruits are on hand in case Covid disrupts sites at the last minute: We expect and have planned for the furloughing of some staff, but with the scale and complexity of the election in a pandemic across Australia’s vast geography, some venues could be impacted at short notice. Anyway, if you’re interested, there are still jobs going, and you can sign up here. Updated at 1.15am BST 12.52am BST Queensland woman dies in flood waters A woman has died in flood waters in north Queensland, premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told parliament on Wednesday. Emergency crews were frantically searching for a woman after a car washed away in Mount Ossa, north of Mackay. “I’m advised they have recovered the body … I offer my heartfelt condolences to the family and I sincerely hope that this is the last tragedy,” Palaszczuk said. A Queensland Fire and Emergency Service spokesperson said they received a call around 5am on Wednesday about a missing woman and a vehicle washed into flood waters at Seaforth Rd and Surprise Creek Rd. A police spokesperson told Guardian Australia they believed two people had managed to escape the vehicle. Palaszczuk said the incident was “a stark reminder” of the dangers of weather events. She said the SES has responded to more than 110 requests for assistance since 3pm on Tuesday. Updated at 12.56am BST 12.52am BST Authorities have confirmed a woman has died in Queensland flood waters. AAP reports: A woman has died after the car she was in became submerged in flood waters triggered by days of torrential rain in north Queensland. The woman became trapped in the vehicle with two other people on Surprise Creek Rd at Mount Ossa, north of Mackay, about 5am on Wednesday. The two others escaped from the car, but the woman’s body was found a short time later. The Queensland Ambulance Service said one of the people who survived was treated for a cut to their head. Queensland Fire and Emergency Services received more than 90 calls for help in the state’s north as six-hour rainfall totals reached 240mm in some areas by 1am on Wednesday. “Although rain is expected to move off the coast in the state’s north today, a large number of roads remain flooded,” QFES said in a statement. “Please avoid unnecessary travel and don’t risk it on flooded roads and causeways. “If it’s flooded, forget it.” Rainfall records tumbled at the Hughenden, Richmond and Cloncurry airports on Tuesday as those inland regions recorded their highest May totals ever. Townsville is set for totals up to 250mm on Wednesday and Thursday with the severe weather warning indicating up to 200mm in a six-hour period. “That whole area under the severe weather warning could see flash and riverine flooding,” Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Laura Boekel said on Tuesday. A flood watch is current for dozens of river and creek catchments across Queensland and almost 300 roads have been cut by flood waters. In the south-east, heavy rain hit the Sunshine Coast and northern Brisbane, with 135mm falling at Mapleton and 113mm at Maleny. “If you are on the road this morning take extra care and plan your drive. If you come across flood water, back it up and find an alternate route,” QFES said in a Facebook post on Wednesday. “With the ground already saturated and further heavy rainfall possible, there is a risk of flash flooding today and over the coming days.” Seqwater has alerted Moreton Bay region residents it has started flood releases from North Pine Dam, with releases also set to start from Wivenhoe and Somerset Dams into the Brisbane River from 10am. The utility expects the releases to flood Savages Crossing, Colleges Crossing, Burtons Bridge and Kholo Bridge downstream, but not Fernvale Bridge. “If you are downstream of the dam, stay away from fast flowing or deep water near waterways and floodplains,” Seqwater said.

Updated at 12.50am BST 12.43am BST Victoria to become first state to ban Nazi symbol The Victorian government is set to become the first Australia state or territory to ban the Nazi symbol, with legislation to be introduced to state parliament today. The Summary Offences Amendment (Nazi Symbol Prohibition) Bill 2022 will make it a criminal offence for a person to intentionally display the Nazi swastika, the Hakenkreuz, in public. Once passed, anyone who intentionally displays the symbol in public faces penalties of up to almost $22,000, 12 months imprisonment or both. The bill also recognises the cultural and historical significance of the swastika for the Buddhist, Hindu and Jain faiths and does not prohibit its display in such contexts. It comes after a parliamentary inquiry last year recommended the ban, citing a recent rise in neo-Nazi activity. NSW is also working on similar legislation.

This morning, Martin accused Sitou of running in Reid because she “found an opportunity”. “And you couldn’t run in Fowler ... Kristina Keneally kicked you out of Fowler too.” Martin told Guardian Australia: Sally grew up in Fowler. Keneally reportedly declined Reid and went for Fowler. I think it makes sense to want to represent the area you grew up in or where you have a long association. Sally’s association with Reid is less than three years total. So, on Martin’s version, she didn’t confuse Sitou and Tu Le, she was just speculating that Sitou might also have wanted to run in Fowler and also have been displaced by Keneally. Earlier, Sitou told 2GB Radio: I didn’t want to raise this, but I chose to live in this electorate because I love the community ... Now [Martin is] just making things up. That’s how ridiculous this debate has gotten. I’m sorry your listeners have had to listen to that. Keneally only made a lower house tilt in 2021 after losing the battle for a winnable senate spot on the NSW Labor senate ticket to Deborah O’Neil.

Statement from Attorney-General Jaclyn Symes: pic.twitter.com/N4WoVQz5O5 — Benita Kolovos (@benitakolovos) May 10, 2022 12.25am BST Liberal MP, Dr Fiona Martin, who is fighting to hold on to the Sydney electorate of Reid, debated her Labor challenger, Sally Sitou, on Sydney radio 2GB this morning. Sitou, whose Chinese parents fled Laos after the Vietnam war, was preselected for the seat of Reid in October last year. The debate got heated, particularly when it came to Martin not living in the electorate (she grew up in it, Sitou lives in it, but grew up in Fowler). That led to this exchange: Martin: You found an opportunity and you couldn’t run in Fowler. Kristina Keneally kicked you out of Fowler too. Sitou: Now she’s just making things up. I mean, that’s how ridiculous this debate has gotten. And I’m really sorry that your listeners have had to listen to that. Tu Le, a lawyer with Vietnamese heritage, had been backed by retiring member Chris Hayes to replace him as Labor’s candidate for Fowler, but had her preselection over-ruled by the NSW Labor branch, who parachuted in Keneally.

Peter Dutton has been sharing it this morning. Labor's campaign is a lie. pic.twitter.com/yNtic9Dqlm — Liberal Party (@LiberalAus) May 10, 2022 Updated at 12.06am BST 11.50pm BST Tony Burke says Anthony Albanese was not making policy on the fly when he backed a figure for a minimum wage increase: Q: Up until Anthony Albanese responded to that question at a media conference yesterday, Labor’s position on the Fair Work Commission case was it wasn’t going to back any figure. Was Anthony Albanese freelancing in responding that way? Burke: Not at all. You heard all of us on many occasions for a long time now say people can’t keep going backward. Q: Not backing a particular figure is what I’m saying. Burke: No, the figure yesterday is the figure that, if you fall below, people are going backwards. Like, for a long time, we have been saying people can’t keep going backwards and as I say, yesterday the question was put as to the figure, which if you fall below people are – would start going backwards. It’s unsurprising that Labor wants to make sure that wages can keep pace with the cost of living. But as I say, he wasn’t questioned on it yesterday because he didn’t face the media scrum again after Anthony Albanese had answered that question. But today, it’s on Scott Morrison to explain why he believes Australian workers should go backwards, because let’s not forget, in the debate the other night, it wasn’t only this – we know now his position is that real wages should fall. When he was asked directly whether Australians should even be at least paid the minimum wage, his response was, “It depends.” We have a prime minister here whose not only refusing to support wages keeping pace with the cost of living, he’s also refusing to back in their being a safety net for a whole lot of workers. Q: The prime minister has responded through the Australian late yesterday where he described Anthony Albanese’s comments as “economic vandalism”. You should factor – surely you factor in any increase of that magnitude by the Fair Work Commission would have clear flow-on effects to inflation and then interest rates? Burke: Well, have a look at both what the Treasury secretary and the RBA have said with respect to inflationary pressures where both of them have made clear that you can go to inflation plus productivity, productivity is currently running at 1%, and if wage increases are in line with inflation plus productivity, then you should not be having inflationary pressures. Last year, for example, when inflation was forecast to run with a number with a 1 in front of it, the annual wage review still put forward a wage increase of 2.5%. It’s not unheard of at all for the annual wage review to go in front of inflation so long as you don’t go inflation plus productivity, it doesn’t have an inflationary impact. What’s happening now is when people are finding it harder than ever; when the cost of living is, in fact, going backwards for a whole lot of wage earners across the country, it’s at this moment that Mr Morrison is refusing to say that wages should even keep up. Updated at 11.59pm BST 11.45pm BST Q: A lot of business operators, a lot of business owners, also thought it was extraordinary as well, Tony Burke, in the sense they’re now worried how they’ll pay a potential 5.1% increase. Burke: Look, I have got a good relationship with a lot of those business organisations that have been in the media and there’s different issues in terms of productivity that we have had very constructive conversations about. But in terms of the annual wage review, I do have to say – some of those commentators, most of them actually, for nearly a decade have been saying, “We can’t have wage increases because inflation is low.” And now they’re saying we can’t have wage increases because inflation is high. The reality is... Q: They’re saying – they want wage increases, for instance, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry is making it 3% wage rise for minimum wage earners, it argues that is more realistic? Burke: Sorry, that’s a pay cut. If, inflation is running at 5.1%, then the figure you have just nominated there is a pay cut. The people who are most reliant on the annual wage review are the people on the lowest wages. The minimum wage in Australia is $20.33 an hour, these are the people who are the heroes of the pandemic, who have kept the economy running during a time where a whole lot of us on higher incomes were able to work from laptops, but they weren’t, turned up, put themselves in harm’s way in different ways, particularly in the early stages of the pandemic, and they’re the people who find it the hardest to make ends meet. They’re the people who are in the least capacity to draw down on savings and they’re the people who, more than anyone, need to make sure that wages can keep up with the cost of living and they don’t keep going backward. Updated at 11.51pm BST 11.44pm BST Labor’s Tony Burke was on the same program responding to criticisms of Anthony Albanese’s support for a minimum wage increase in line with inflation: For nearly a decade, this government has had low wages as a deliberate design feature of their economic management. They wanted to deliberately keep wages low and they have. Labor wants to get wages moving again and we will. We cannot have a situation when everything is going up except wages and people keep going backwards. And that’s what Anthony Albanese made clear yesterday. The extraordinary thing about this story is not that Labor wants to make sure that wages keep pace with the cost of living, the extraordinary thing about this story is Scott Morrison doesn’t. He – the outrage we’re seeing from him and his ministers at the moment as though somehow it would be a terrible thing for Australians to stop going backwards really says it all, that he doesn’t understand anything about what’s happening in the household budget at the moment. Updated at 11.52pm BST 11.42pm BST Jane Hume then seemingly defends Scott Morrison’s criticism of barristers and lawyers yesterday as being taken out of context: Q: Where have we become, as a nation, when the Prime Minister of Australia yesterday said that he has no truck with barristers and lawyers? Hume: Well, I don’t think he said that he has no truck with the legal system. Q: No, no. No. He said - I’m going to read the quote here. “They disagree with me all the time. I have never had much truck with them - bars and lawyers - over the course of my entire political career.” Hume: I’m not entirely sure of the context of that comment but I can assure you the Prime Minister upholds the rule of law and respects the legal profession. Q: The Bar Association is very angry about this. Matt Collins QC, who you probably know, a prominent silk in Melbourne, said this is an attack on Australia’s hard-working 6,500 barristers, making the point - which really doesn’t have to be made - barristers and lawyers are a key part of the system in Australia in terms of administering justice. Again, where are we at in a country with the Prime Minister saying he has no truck with barristers and lawyers. Hume: I don’t think this is a comment worth taking out of context. Q: Well, the context is he was asked about the ICAC, his criticisms of the New South Wales ICAC, which he stood behind and then he pivoted to this. I’ll read the quote again. “They disagree with me all the time” - this is barristers and former judges who criticised the Prime Minister for criticising the New South Wales ICAC - “they disagree with me all the time. I’ve never had much truck with them over the course of my political career”. Hume: In the context of the Icac, the Government wants to make sure there is a Commonwealth integrity commission introduced in the life this parliament but we want to make sure that it’s one that presumes innocence, not guilt, that it doesn’t turn into a show trial, that it isn’t simply Icac on 24/7TV. We want to make sure it delivers integrity. Q: Do you agree that ICAC is kangaroo court? Hume: I didn’t say that. The Prime Minister said that. Q: What do you think of the Prime Minister describing it as a kangaroo court? Hume: We want to make sure - I do, as the Prime Minister, and the Coalition Government - that any Commonwealth integrity commission delivers justice, it delivers a presumption of innocence and it doesn’t deliver a show trial which is exactly what the Prime Minister is objecting too. 11.39pm BST Talking points on Katherine Deves have obviously been sent out to Coalition MPs – compare this interview with Jane Hume to the earlier post on Stuart Robert talking on the same subject. Q: The Liberal candidate for Warringah says transgender people who transition are surgically mutilated. The prime minister has defended those comments. Do you defend those comments? Hume: I think that Katherine Deves is fighting for an important cause, which is fairness for women in sport ... (There are already rules in place for most sporting codes to handle trans people in sport.) Q: Yeah, she is fighting that cause, but I will stick to the question. This has to do with her assertion that transgender people are mutilated – mutilated – when they transition. Do you, like the prime minister did yesterday, defend those comments? Hume: I would not use those words. I wouldn’t use them on social media, and I wouldn’t use them in conversation with you or anyone. That said, Katherine Deves is fighting for an important cause. Q: Should that have been what the prime minister said yesterday? Hume: I’m not going to pass judgement on what the prime minister did or didn’t say. But the most important thing is Katherine Deves is fighting for an important cause, which is fairness for women being able to play in sport fairly and equally. Q: She’s making that argument but again she goes back to her assertions on transgender people. How do you think that will play – and you’ve been campaigning in seats under threat from teal independents in Melbourne – how will that play with the campaigns of Tim Wilson in Goldstein, Josh Frydenberg in Kooyong? Hume: I think there’s an awful lot of women in those seats that want to make sure that they and their daughters can play fairly and equally in sport. In sport. Q: How would parents of [trans children], for argument’s sake, feel about the comments of Katherine Deves? Hume: I’m not going to second-guess how people would feel about those comments. Suffice to say ... Q: You don’t think they’d be, at the very least, upset? Hume: These are sensitive issues and should be approached cautiously, making sure our language is not insensitive in the way it’s expressed, because these are important issues and we know that particularly transgender children are some of the most vulnerable people in our society. Updated at 11.45pm BST 11.34pm BST On the issue of wage growth, Paul Karp has taken a look at some of the issues: Jim Stanford, the director of the Centre for Future Work, told Guardian Australia that ‘wages didn’t cause the current inflation’, which he blamed on “supply chains, the oil price spike, and an initial surge in post-pandemic spending”. ‘Telling workers they need to just swallow a permanent reduction in earnings, as a result of inflation they didn’t cause, in order to prevent future inflation, is neither fair nor economically justified,’ he said. Stanford is a co-author of a report titled The Wages Crisis: Revisited that finds that since 2013, nominal wages have become locked into a trajectory of about 2% growth a year, about half the rate of before 2013. Scott Morrison has argued during the election campaign that there is no ‘magic pen’ that can drive wages higher, and only low unemployment can do that. But the report, also co-authored by professor Andrew Stewart and associate professor Tess Hardy, finds there is no systematic relationship between wage growth and labour demand and that Australia has had among the weakest wage growth in the OECD despite stronger macro conditions. Related: Industry warns ’small business can’t afford it’ after Albanese backs 5.1% minimum wage rise Updated at 11.37pm BST 11.28pm BST Q: What does it say to you – and what should voters read from the fact that you’ve been in power for eight and a half years and real wages have been anaemic at best? Jane Hume: We know this is not just an issue in Australia. I wouldn’t say anaemic. In fact, real wages have grown. Q: Not by much, though. Hume: They haven’t grown at the rate we would like to see, but that’s because of a number of issues, and it’s not just Australia that has experienced [them]. Q: But you’ve had eight and a half years in power to address this problem. Surely voters can look back at that and ask serious questions as to, what has the Coalition done to improve my lot? Hume: I think the most important statistic that Australian voters should take to this election is that unemployment is so exceptionally low. It’s at 4% and looks like heading below that. Of course, when there is low unemployment, employers think differently. They think what can I do to attract and retain the best employees? What do I pay them? What are my workplace standards? What is going to bring the best and the brightest to my business? That changes the dial. We haven’t included the fact – and the RBA did in its decision-making around interest rates – that around a million people last year, and just in the last couple of months of last year, changed jobs, and they changed jobs for a pay increase of somewhere between 8% and 10%. That only happens when unemployment is exceptionally low. That’s why the Coalition is committed to another 1.3 million jobs over the next five years, keeping that unemployment rate low – 450,000 of those in the regions as well. Updated at 11.33pm BST 11.25pm BST But what does the Coalition think should happen, given inflation? Hume says: The Fair Work Commission will make its decision based on all sorts of information – the cost of living and making sure wage rises are sustainable, fair and appropriate in the future, that they won’t necessarily throw the economy so out of whack that interest rates end up rising and inflation ends up rising as well. We want to make sure the economy is sustained at a steady growth rate. Too high wage rises would disrupt that. Updated at 11.30pm BST 11.24pm BST Jane Hume was on ABC News Breakfast making the government’s case against Anthony Albanese’s support for a minimum wage increase in line with inflation: What’s wrong is Anthony Albanese weighing in on the independent Fair Work Commission’s decision as to what it should do with minimum wages. That would be unprecedented. No government should weigh in on the Fair Work Commission’s decision. The government, of course, provides the Fair Work Commission with information and data around how to make that decision, but it certainly doesn’t weigh in with a position. The Fair Work Commission is independent, just like the RBA is independent on interest rates. The Fair Work Commission should always remain independent on minimum wages. Updated at 11.26pm BST 11.14pm BST Patricia Karvelas asks Stuart Robert if the government is “using trans people as political footballs”. Robert: No, not at all. I just want people to have respectful conversations and let the words be seasoned with grace. Some conversations are difficult, and we should just be respectful. We should have them – we should talk through the issues as a society because they are important. PK: 10 days out from polling day, do you really think this is a top-order issue for Australians? Robert: My personal view is not, but it seems to be a top order issue for many journalists. PK: You’re blaming journalists for your own candidate in Warringah? Robert: There’s no blame. But I’m happy to have a conversation, as is anyone standing for office, that the Australian people may may raise. If I look at my own electorate, the biggest issue that people raise is cost of living, but I won’t shy away from any other conversation that people may seek to raise. And I’d simply say to other Australians to echo the prime minister’s words, let’s have a graceful conversation. Robert adopted exactly the same vocal tone as the prime minister as he discussed these issues, almost down to the same vocal inflections. Updated at 11.22pm BST 11.10pm BST Stuart Robert and RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas have had a circular conversation about Katherine Deve’s comments about trans people and Scott Morrison’s ongoing support for his handpicked candidate. Q: The prime minister has doubled down on his defence of Katherine Deves’s comments about transgender mutilation. Do you accept that that can’t be helping these MPs, including your own treasurer, in these seats that are being challenged [by teal independents]? Robert: It is a difficult topic. They’re not words that I would use. The prime minister made this point yesterday they are not words that he would use. The issue is about girls and sport and there are some families struggling with some real issues and identity, we understand that. We’d like to have a civil, a gentle conversation. I think seasoned with grace would be a good way to explain it because it is a difficult issue. It is an emotive issue, but a bit more graceful words I think would go a long way. PK: Okay, so the prime minister said gender reversal* surgery for young adolescents, you know, is something that it’s you can’t go back on but there’s no gender reversal surgery for young adolescents. That’s what the doctors have told us. They’re the facts minister. Why did the prime minister get it wrong? [*It is gender confirmation or affirmation surgery.] Robert: I don’t believe the prime minister did get it wrong. PK: But there is no gender [confirmation] surgery for people under 18. Do you accept that? Robert: I’ll leave that to the medical experts because I’m not the health minister, so I can’t comment on something I’m not across in terms of the health advice in that respect. The key issue here is if there’s to be a national conversation, and there should be on all issues that are difficult, let’s do it respectfully, let’s use language that is gracious. Let’s lift people up, not tear them down. It’s difficult for families. So we should talk about the issues. We should talk about girls and sport. We should talk about ... PK: You say that. You talk about this as if this kind of approach should be taken. But isn’t it your own candidate and your own government, that’s been fuelling a very, very divisive debate on this? Robert: And again, I’ll go back to the prime minister’s comments yesterday that they’re not words he would use and certainly not words... PK: But he’s stood by her and she’s using them. Robert: Well, we should stand by people who stand up for what they believe in. Ms Deves is a strong ... PK: Even if what you believe in is using divisive language, when just a moment ago, you told me that divisive language shouldn’t be used? Robert: It shouldn’t be used. PK: So why stand by her? Robert: Because she’s a strong passionate woman who’s got something to say. Now, I may disagree with some of the words and terms she uses. But she is trying to stand up for something she’s passionate about and have a conversation about it. PK: What’s the conversation you’re trying to have? Robert: The conversation she seeking to have is about girls playing girls in sport. PK: No – she’s made comments about mutilation, trans people being mutilated, that’s not about playing sport, minister. Robert: And again, they’re not words that we would use. PK: And yet she’s been backed by the prime minister. Robert: Because it’s an important issue she’s raising about girls in sport. PK: What is the issue? Robert: That when it comes to sport, girls play against girls, and those that were ostensibly biologically male, who then make a choice to become a girl, that that becomes uncompetitive in sport. That’s the conversation she’s having. That’s what she’s stood up for. That’s her sense of belief. So let’s have the conversation. But we’d encourage everyone to do it gracefully. [It should be noted that there are already rules in place to deal with trans people playing sport.] Updated at 11.19pm BST 10.48pm BST Stuart Robert is outraged over Anthony Albanese’s stated support for a 5.1% minimum wage increase, as he speaks to ABC radio’s RN Breakfast. The last thing you want is political leaders providing commentary on what the independent umpire should do. But when asked about the inflationary pressure of the government’s own spending, Robert says that is completely different. Treasury makes the point that the cost of living adjustment package in the budget did not have a deleterious effect in terms of of inflation, and the budgetary supports we provided were designed to assist Australians because we could see the external inflationary pressures coming upon our shores. Updated at 10.51pm BST 10.41pm BST Good morning It’s the 31st day of the election campaign and we are still talking about all the things which dominated day one – it’s all just more intense now. The third and final debate, this time hosted by the Seven Network, will be held tonight (after Big Brother) and comes at a time when both leaders are increasingly desperate to paint the other one as the risky desperado. Scott Morrison thinks he has an in with Anthony Albanese’s assertion yesterday he “absolutely” would support a minimum wage increase of 5.1% to match inflation. Morrison is going with the “economic vandal” line – despite inflation expected to rise to about 6%. Stagnant wage growth over the last few years (in real terms) has meant people have less money to spend as prices increase, and without a wage increase, they’ll have even less income. Keeping wages at pace with the cost of living means people can continue to buy the same amount of goods. If prices keep going up and wages don’t, cuts have to be made somewhere, meaning businesses lose out. Morrison has seized on the line that a wage increase in line with inflation would only increase inflationary pressures, meaning rates would continue to rise and the cycle continues. But a 5.1% pay increase in a 5.1% inflation increase world wouldn’t mean people would have extra money – they would just be able to buy the same amount as they would have before inflation rose. You’ll be hearing more and more on that, though, over the next 10 days. Meanwhile, Albanese will continue to push Morrison on a federal integrity commission, as the prime minister triples down on his attacks on NSW’s Icac. There’s also the not small issue of a new report showing 91% of the Great Barrier Reef’s coral reefs have been impacted by bleaching.

Sunak’s launch video – in which he began with: “Let me tell you a story” – stressed his humble roots, as if in deliberate riposte to reports earlier this year about his immense wealth and his wife’s tax affairs. Those stories – as well as the botched spring statement, which had to be revisited within weeks – appeared to have killed Sunak’s leadership chances, are now being turned to his advantage, as evidence he’s already been through the media mill. Buzzing about at his carefully choreographed leadership launch was Cass Horowitz, the co-founder of creative agency The Clerkenwell Brothers and the person credited with building up Brand Rishi as his special adviser at the Treasury. When Sunak was chancellor, announcements of Treasury policies such as eat out to help out came stamped with his personal signature. For the back-to-work Kickstart scheme, there were even branded hoodies. By contrast to “Rish”, as aides call him, Truss has focused on bolstering her authority, rather than getting down with the kids. As foreign secretary, she has used the splendour of the Foreign Office and the stage of global diplomacy to underline her stateswomanlike qualities. She had already been accused of trying to ape Margaret Thatcher in a series of photoshoots. Since the leadership race kicked off, the comparisons have looked ever more deliberate, most strikingly when she wore a Thatcher-trademark pussy bow blouse in the first televised debate. Truss has also emphasised the extent to which she would take the economy in a different direction – perhaps partly in an attempt to shrug off the sense that she is the continuity Boris candidate, backed by loyalists such as Nadine Dorries. Truss has been firmly controlled in how much media she has done, however – no broadcast interviews, just a few sit-down chats with favoured journalists. Like Boris Johnson, who did little media in the early stages of the 2019 leadership contest, she is firmly focused on winning over MPs in private calls and meetings. The decision by Truss and Sunak to skip Tuesday’s TV leadership debate – effectively pulling the plug on it – underlines the fact that for candidates with a well-established brand and track record, there is little to be gained from inviting further public exposure. For the other, less well-known candidates, the calculus has been different, however, and closer to the adage that any publicity is good publicity. Penny Mordaunt took more questions and came across as more approachable than the stage-managed Sunak or the wooden Truss – and she also submitted herself to a Sky News interview. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST Her leadership video, with soundtrack by Holst, and sweeping shots of heroic service personnel and the Red Arrows, urged MPs to choose a new leader, “not just for ourselves, but for all of us”. With no mention of Mordaunt herself until the last few seconds, it seemed to be aimed at creating a general vibe of patriotism and confidence as the backdrop for her bid. Kemi Badenoch, too, without the platform of cabinet experience to draw on, has aimed at raising her profile. She has stressed her humble backstory (teenage burger-flipping is repeatedly mentioned) and straight-talking approach – with some success, judging by Sunday’s ConHome poll, which put her on top among members. Her campaign website carries this quote from her: “I’m putting myself forward in this leadership election because I want to tell the truth. It’s the truth that will set us free.” Team Tugendhat have embraced every scrap of attention available to the outsider remaining in the race. Realistically, he is aiming more at boosting his profile and securing a cabinet post, than becoming the next prime minister. To that end, Tom Tugendhat held a laid-back press conference last week, happily parrying questions from anyone who turned up; and on another occasion, answered questions sent in by the public in a low-tech, Rory Stewart-style video – including whether he still wears army socks (he does). The cancellation of Tuesday’s debate underlines the extent to which at this point, the best-known candidates are targeting their charm offensive on the very niche audience of 357 other Conservative MPs. But whoever wins the keys to No 10 in six weeks’ time, in the depths of a cost of living crisis, producing slick videos, stirring soundtracks and pithy soundbites will not be the key skills required.","Id":"politics/2022/jul/18/cancelled-tv-debate-underlines-who-sunak-and-truss-are-now-targeting-tory-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Cancelled TV debate underlines who Sunak and Truss are now targeting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/18/cancelled-tv-debate-underlines-who-sunak-and-truss-are-now-targeting-tory-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/18/cancelled-tv-debate-underlines-who-sunak-and-truss-are-now-targeting-tory-mps","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":741,"webPublicationDate":"2022-07-18T15:42:10Z","hosted":false,"id":"politics/2022/jul/18/cancelled-tv-debate-underlines-who-sunak-and-truss-are-now-targeting-tory-mps"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Elon Musk tweet sparks debate in Japan on falling birthrate","body":"Elon Musk has warned that Japan will “cease to exist” unless it addresses its falling birthrate, sparking calls for the country to allow more immigration and improve its work-life balance. “At the risk of stating the obvious, unless something changes to cause the birthrate to exceed the death rate, Japan will eventually cease to exist. This would be a great loss for the world,” the Tesla chief executive, who recently agreed a deal to buy Twitter for $44bn (£36bn), said in a post at the weekend. Musk, who has previously voiced concern about global population collapse, was responding to government data showing that Japan’s population fell by a record 644,000 last year – the 11th consecutive year of decline. Some social media users said Japan was not the only developed economy experiencing long-term population decline, but others used Musk’s tweet to criticise successive governments’ half-hearted attempts to raise the birthrate in the world’s third-biggest economy. Japan’s population peaked in 2008 and had fallen to about 125 million by last year, despite government warnings about the effect on economic growth and occasional campaigns to encourage couples to have bigger families. Some Japan experts took Musk to task over his tweet. “What is even the point of tweeting this?” wrote Tobias Harris, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. “The anxieties surrounding Japan’s demographic future is not that ‘Japan will eventually cease to exist’ but rather the profound social dislocations that are occurring as a result of the decline to a lower population level.” Others called on the Japanese government to further relax the country’s strict rules on immigration, although plans to admit up to half a million blue-collar workers by 2025 to address serious labour shortages have been frustrated by the coronavirus pandemic. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST There were also calls to address the low birthrate, including making it easier for women to return to work after having children. “They keep saying the birthrate’s falling, but given that the government isn’t taking thorough steps to deal with it, what can we say?” one Twitter user said. “Everything they say and do is contradictory. “In this environment, who’s going to say ‘OK, let’s have a child’? I despair for Japan.” Experts blame Japan’s low birthrate on several factors, including the high financial cost of bringing up children, the lack of childcare provision and notoriously long working hours. The country’s population is also one of the world’s oldest, with a record high of almost 29% aged 65 and above, according to government data.","Id":"world/2022/may/09/elon-musk-tweet-sparks-debate-in-japan-on-falling-birthrate","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Elon Musk tweet sparks debate in Japan on falling birthrate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/elon-musk-tweet-sparks-debate-in-japan-on-falling-birthrate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/09/elon-musk-tweet-sparks-debate-in-japan-on-falling-birthrate","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":418,"webPublicationDate":"2022-05-09T10:47:04Z","hosted":false,"id":"world/2022/may/09/elon-musk-tweet-sparks-debate-in-japan-on-falling-birthrate"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Record number of Britons head to Greece as nation enjoys tourism boom","body":"UK travellers are leading an extraordinary rebound in tourism to Greece with arrivals up by 181% last year, according to the country’s central bank. Almost 4.5 million Britons were registered at Greek entry points, a record number and nearly 3 million more than in 2021. For the first time, UK tourists edged out Germans – who have topped the visitor league tables in Greece for decades – in what some are calling a defiant display of post-pandemic “revenge” tourism. “In terms of Greece, the Brits are leading the way,” the nation’s tourism minister, Vassilis Kikilias, told the Guardian. “And they’re big spenders.” Central bank figures released last week showed UK visitors generating over €3bn (£2.65bn) in tourism revenues in 2022, more than twice the amount they spent the previous year. “Yes, there may be an energy crisis, and very high inflation and a war in the heart of Europe with households forced to make savings,” said Kikilias. “But the data shows that Brits aren’t sacrificing their summer holidays.” Prior to the pandemic, just under 3.5 million UK citizens visited Greece in 2019, itself a record year in which a still unprecedented 33.1 million tourists descended on the country – more than three times Greece’s entire population. Greece was among the most visited places on Earth in 2022. US travellers returned en masse, with the prolonged tourist season beginning in March and ending in late November. The rebound in a country so heavily reliant on tourism – it accounts for 25% of the country’s GDP – helped the economy grow by an unexpected 5.6% in 2022, a recovery that would have been unimaginable during Greece’s long-running debt crisis. The dramatic rise has spurred concerns over the impact excessive tourism will have on the environment and cultural sites such as the Acropolis, where visitor numbers have also exploded. Before the season has even begun industry officials say there is every sign the bonanza will continue. “From the early bookings in Britain, it’s clear that this year will be as good, if not better, than last,” said Grigoris Tasios, president of the Hellenic Hoteliers Federation. “Tour operators were requesting more beds and more flights back in November when we attended London’s World Travel Market.” The British-owned low-cost leisure airline Jet2, now the UK’s biggest tour operator, had, he said, injected “particular dynamism” into the prospect of a continuing rise in UK visitors by expanding its itinerary and flying into destinations nationwide. Kikilias says “the calculated risk” Athens took opening up the country to travel in the summer of 2020 – instituting a multiple-testing system before the introduction of vaccines – had helped tourists see Greece as a safe destination. But he also attributed the rebound to behind-the-scenes negotiations with British airlines to expand and extend routes and flying times. Post-Brexit, Anglo-Greek relations have additionally evolved – with both governments, for the first time, engaging in talks over the possible return to Athens of the western world’s most contested piece of art: the fifth-century BC Parthenon marbles. “It’s true there was a big debate about how our relations would develop,” Kikilias said, “but they go back a long way and we are both aware of that.”","Id":"world/2023/feb/26/record-number-of-britons-head-to-greece-as-nation-enjoys-tourism-boom","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Record number of Britons head to Greece as nation enjoys tourism boom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/26/record-number-of-britons-head-to-greece-as-nation-enjoys-tourism-boom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/26/record-number-of-britons-head-to-greece-as-nation-enjoys-tourism-boom","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":528,"webPublicationDate":"2023-02-26T18:07:24Z","hosted":false,"id":"world/2023/feb/26/record-number-of-britons-head-to-greece-as-nation-enjoys-tourism-boom"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Sunak scorns Truss’s claims that tax cuts can avert recession","body":"Liz Truss has claimed her tax cut plans could avert the looming recession, after the Bank of England forecast 13% inflation and a downturn lasting more than a year. In a televised leadership interview, the foreign secretary was challenged about gloomy projections made by the Bank on Thursday, as it increased interest rates by 0.5 percentage points. “What the Bank of England has said today is, of course, extremely worrying. But it is not inevitable,” she said. “We can change the outcome, and we can make it more likely that the economy grows.” Truss and her Conservative leadership rival, Rishi Sunak, were each grilled by a studio audience made up of Conservative members, and Sky News presenter Kay Burley. Sunak, who appeared after Truss, stepped up his criticisms of her £30bn plan for unfunded tax cuts, claiming it would lead to “misery for millions”. “The lights on the economy are flashing red, and the root cause is inflation. I’m worried that Liz Truss’s plans will make the situation worse,” he said. “If we just put fuel on the fire of this inflation spiral, all of us, all of you, are going to just end up with higher mortgage rates, savings and pensions that are eaten away, and misery for millions.” But Truss insisted that “now is the time to be bold, because if we don’t act now, we are headed for very, very difficult times”, reiterating her policies of reversing the recent increase in national insurance contributions and halting planned increases in corporation tax. Asked what more she would do to deal with rocketing energy prices, Truss cited her existing policy of temporarily halting green levies that add about £150 to household bills. Liz Truss and Kay Burley during the Sky news debate in Cardiff. The leadership favourite says recession is ‘not inevitable’. Photograph: Chris Lobina/Sky News/PA Truss rejected the idea of a windfall tax on the bumper profits of energy companies. “Shareholders are not all men in suits sitting in offices. There is no such thing as free money, and I just think we’ve got to be very careful if the UK gets a reputation for arbitrarily taking money in tax.” Sunak also said he would do more as prime minister to help hard-pressed consumers through the winter ahead. He recently announced a pledge to cut VAT on energy bills – a policy he had previously rejected. When asked about the recession, he said: “It’s not the tax burden that is causing the recession. That’s simply wrong. What’s causing the recession is inflation. That’s the root of the problems, not just here, but in America and elsewhere.” Truss was challenged robustly by two audience members – over the public finances, and her botched announcement of pay cuts for public sector workers. Jill of Tunbridge Wells accused Truss of failing to take seriously enough the need to balance the books. “The one thing Margaret Thatcher believed in was sound money,” she said. “Fifteen percent interest rates, I remember those days. I had to pay a mortgage of 15%, are we going back to that level again?” Truss replied “no”, and went on to stress the risks of high taxes for economic growth. Another audience member, Tom from Gateshead, pressed Truss on the plan for regional pay boards which she withdrew earlier this week. “Why should we trust your judgment?” Pointing out that it would have meant lower pay for public sector workers in his local area of Newcastle, he added: “Will you apologise because it was actually quite offensive?” Truss replied: “I don’t think there is anything to be ashamed of, of saying publicly that this is not working as I wanted it to work, and therefore, I have changed the position on it.” Sunak was accused by an audience member, Steven, of plotting to overthrow Johnson, and resigning last month in a cynical bid to win the leadership. Citing the scandal of former Conservative whip Chris Pincher, who was promoted by Johnson despite multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, Sunak insisted “that was a serious ethical question that the government was on the wrong side of, again, and I couldn’t defend it”. Rishi Sunak argued his rival’s tax plans will lead to ‘misery for millions’. Photograph: Chris Lobina/Sky News/PA Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST By contrast, Truss gave a staunch defence of Boris Johnson. When Burley said she had “stood shoulder to shoulder with a man who has betrayed the office of prime minster”, Truss insisted: “Yes he made mistakes, that’s absolutely true; he said sorry for the mistakes he made – but I think it’s completely wrong to characterise him in that way.” Challenged about Truss’s broad backing among cabinet members and former leadership contenders, including his former boss Sajid Javid, Sunak stressed the Conservative grandees who have supported him, including former leaders William Hague and Michael Howard. In a show of hands after the show, Sunak was the clear winner among the audience of Conservative members. After the debate, Sunak announced a new housing policy, saying he would introduce a build out levy, which would charge developers a fee if they are given planning permission and fail to build the promised homes. He said the policy would help to promote homeownership – though he has also promised to tighten planning restrictions on green belt land. “I will do whatever it takes to build housing that is affordable and plentiful, while protecting the green belt – spreading the joy and fulfilment of homeownership, building the next generation of Conservative voters and keeping Labour out of power,” he said.","Id":"politics/2022/aug/04/sunak-and-truss-clash-over-cost-of-living-crisis-and-boe-recession-forecast","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Sunak scorns Truss’s claims that tax cuts can avert recession","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/04/sunak-and-truss-clash-over-cost-of-living-crisis-and-boe-recession-forecast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/04/sunak-and-truss-clash-over-cost-of-living-crisis-and-boe-recession-forecast","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":878,"webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T22:25:28Z","hosted":false,"id":"politics/2022/aug/04/sunak-and-truss-clash-over-cost-of-living-crisis-and-boe-recession-forecast"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"‘Gloves are off’: what the papers say about the Tory leadership TV debate","body":"The newspaper coverage of the increasingly personal battle between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss for the Tory leadership reveals a fascinating picture of the party’s divisions.

A committee of French MPs will now investigate the ride-hailing company’s relationships with public officials, including with Macron, after journalists revealed extensive lobbying of politicians by the company. The Uber files project, which was published by the Guardian and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), revealed that the company identified Macron as a key ally during his time as economy minister. Macron sought to assist Uber, at one point claiming that he had brokered a “deal” with its political opponents, the files indicated. The documents were provided to the Guardian by Mark MacGann, formerly Uber’s chief European lobbyist, who said he had come to believe the company was exploiting its drivers. In its response to the investigation, Uber admitted mistakes and said its new CEO had overhauled the company’s practices. Danielle Simonnet, the French MP who brought the motion calling for the inquiry, said that in addition to the economic consequences of the gig economy, the commission would examine the “role of public officials” and “relationships between public and private decision-makers”. The phrasing appears to be a euphemistic reference to Uber’s relationship with Macron. A previous motion by Simmonet was rejected last year on the grounds that it explicitly referred to the French president. The French inquiry is the second parliamentary investigation into Uber’s political relationships to commence launched as a result of the files. A two-month Belgian commission of inquiry into the Uber files was scheduled to begin on Thursday. Separately, on Wednesday the Uber files were debated at a session of the European parliament in Strasbourg. Several MEPs expressed concerns about last year’s reports, as well as ongoing lobbying of European parliamentarians by private interests generally. Others were severely critical of Uber’s business model and accused the company of exploiting drivers. “Workers can have flexibility while being employed,” said Kim van Sparrentak, a Dutch Green MEP. “People with difficulty finding work deserve a real job, with rights and fair wages, rather than a gig work app that follows their every step.” Agnes Jongerius, of the Dutch Labour party, said lobbying of MEPs had become even more intensive since the Uber files investigation and called on the parliament to “look at the influence exerted by large technology companies as well”. “If we don’t do this once and for all now, this [gig economy] model could be like an oil slick on the whole economy,” she said. Uber denies exploiting drivers. In response to the Uber files investigation it said the company had “moved from an era of confrontation to one of collaboration, demonstrating a willingness to come to the table and find common ground with former opponents, including labour unions and taxi companies”. The company said Uber was “now regulated in more than 10,000 cities around the world, working at all levels of government to improve the lives of those using our platform and the cities we serve”. Speaking on behalf of the European Commission, Ylva Johansson told the Strasbourg debate that the commission “attached great importance to the role of whistleblowers for the good functioning of our democracy and economy”. She added that the commission had sought further information from the former digital commissioner Neelie Kroes after the files suggested she had secretly helped Uber to lobby the Dutch government, and that the European anti-fraud office (OLAF) was currently examining the matter.","Id":"news/2023/jan/20/uber-lobbying-activities-in-france-face-inquiry-after-guardian-investigation","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webTitle":"Uber’s lobbying activities in France face inquiry after Guardian investigation ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/jan/20/uber-lobbying-activities-in-france-face-inquiry-after-guardian-investigation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2023/jan/20/uber-lobbying-activities-in-france-face-inquiry-after-guardian-investigation","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":588,"webPublicationDate":"2023-01-20T12:28:08Z","hosted":false,"id":"news/2023/jan/20/uber-lobbying-activities-in-france-face-inquiry-after-guardian-investigation"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Labour look to force vote on ending private schools’ tax breaks","body":"Labour will attempt to force a binding vote on ending private schools’ tax breaks and use the £1.7bn a year raised from this to drive new teacher recruitment. The motion submitted by Keir Starmer’s party for the opposition day debate on Wednesday is drafted to push the charitable status scheme that many private schools enjoy to be investigated, as the party attempts to shift the political focus on to education. It comes as the party released fresh statistics highlighting the state of teaching staff, with Labour analysis of official figures from the Department for Education revealing that there were 36,262 teachers who left the profession in 2020/21, compared with only 34,394 starters on initial teacher training, leaving a shortfall of 1,868. Labour’s motion seeks to create a new House of Commons select committee on the fair taxation of schools and education standards to investigate reforming the tax benefits enjoyed by private schools and investing the proceeds on a new national excellence programme. Bridget Phillipson MP, the shadow education secretary, says the party will invest the money raised from tax breaks to hire 6,500 additional teachers, “reducing workloads and driving up to standards in all our state schools through our national excellence programme”. She adds: “Labour recognises that after 13 years of Conservative economic mismanagement, which culminated in the Conservatives crashing the economy last year, tough choices must be made to protect public finances – but the choice facing MPs today is easy. “Conservative MPs can either vote to deliver a brilliant state education for every child or they vote against the interests of parents across this country who aspire for better for their children, especially those in the very regions their party pledged to ‘level up’.” Labour will hope the motion will force the government to make its MPs vote down an issue, rather than ignoring the process. A Labour source has previously said: “Conservative MPs voting against our motion are voting against higher standards in state schools for the majority of children in our country.” A government spokesperson said the number of teachers “remains high”, with 24,000 more working in state schools than in 2010, while bursaries and levelling up premiums were helping attract new entrants to subjects like maths, science and computing.","Id":"education/2023/jan/11/labour-look-to-force-vote-on-ending-private-schools-tax-breaks","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webTitle":"Labour look to force vote on ending private schools’ tax breaks ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jan/11/labour-look-to-force-vote-on-ending-private-schools-tax-breaks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2023/jan/11/labour-look-to-force-vote-on-ending-private-schools-tax-breaks","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":373,"webPublicationDate":"2023-01-11T06:00:09Z","hosted":false,"id":"education/2023/jan/11/labour-look-to-force-vote-on-ending-private-schools-tax-breaks"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Queensland human rights commissioner says police must watch for vigilante activity","body":"The Queensland human rights commissioner, Scott McDougall, says police must closely monitor vigilante activity, amid concern about the role of anti-crime Facebook groups where residents have threatened children or called for violent responses to youth crime. Debate about youth crime in Queensland last week prompted the state government to override its Human Rights Act to introduce new laws, which will result in children being charged with criminal offences for breaching bail conditions. Experts say there is no evidence to support such a move. The state says it is responding to “community expectations”. At the same time there is growing concern that Facebook anti-crime groups – including some that have morphed into influential lobby groups – have skewed community sentiment, normalised racism and excused calls for violence and retribution. Guardian Australia has seen posts on community crime Facebook pages calling for vigilante responses, including multiple calls to “run over” Indigenous teenagers. Related: ‘Everybody has had a gutful’: online anti-crime groups propel Queensland to a political reckoning Earlier this month, the Guardian reported that children living in a Queensland residential care home were the subject of death threats on social media – including calls for neighbours to “storm the house” and “hang whoever is inside” – after media reports incorrectly claimed the premises was a halfway house for young criminals. Police have repeatedly warned publicly against vigilantism, but there are growing concerns that recent heightened debate in Queensland, and a series of high-profile incidents, might increase that risk. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup A court has heard that in 2021, alleged Townsville vigilante Christopher Michael Hughes was chasing a car when he lost control, became airborne and struck a motorbike, killing the rider, Jennifer Board. The killing of Noongar-Yamatji schoolboy Cassius Turvey in Western Australia led to heightened concerns about the attacks by vigilantes whose hostility is fuelled by racist comments on social media. McDougall said the Human Rights Commission occasionally referred incidents of alleged criminal activity to police and “recent tragic events interstate demonstrate the need for police to closely monitor vigilante activity”. “While there are government plans to amend the criminal code to enable police to respond to these sorts of criminal incitements more easily, the existing criminal provision in the Anti-Discrimination Act does allow police to bring charges against a person who incites hatred by threatening harm to a person or group of people.” Guardian Australia asked police several questions about their response to incitement of violence, including whether they had taken action against posters making overt threats for incitement on social media. “The QPS actively monitors social media platforms for criminal behaviour and investigates matters as necessary,” they said in a statement. “The QPS has a strong working relationship with various social media platforms, having hosted forums with representatives from major companies and eSafety attending and reaffirming their commitment to addressing these issues. “There have been numerous cases where social media platforms have removed content or accounts at our request, where users have promoted, incited or instructed in matters of crime or violence.” Related: Powerpoint and politics: inside Queensland Labor’s shock decision to lock up children for breaching bail Police said they had also worked with social media companies to remove content “depicting criminal behaviour” including “bragging” posts by young people. Guardian Australia asked Facebook’s parent company, Meta, about vigilante, violent and racist posts in community anti-crime groups, including comments about a desire to “run over” Indigenous teenagers and describing them as “road kill”. Meta said it had “strict rules which outline what is and isn’t allowed on Facebook and Instagram”. “Hate speech and incitement to violence are against these rules and we invest heavily in teams and technology to help us find and remove this content. We investigated and removed most of the posts that were shared for violating our policies.”","Id":"australia-news/2023/feb/27/queensland-human-rights-commissioner-says-police-must-watch-for-vigilante-activity","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Queensland human rights commissioner says police must watch for vigilante activity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/27/queensland-human-rights-commissioner-says-police-must-watch-for-vigilante-activity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/feb/27/queensland-human-rights-commissioner-says-police-must-watch-for-vigilante-activity","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":610,"webPublicationDate":"2023-02-26T14:00:22Z","hosted":false,"id":"australia-news/2023/feb/27/queensland-human-rights-commissioner-says-police-must-watch-for-vigilante-activity"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"How well did the Tory leadership candidates do in the second TV debate?","body":"Sometimes in TV debates there are clear winners. It often happens in the first debate of a series, when viewers do not know what to expect, and it happened last week, when Rishi Sunak and Tom Tugendhat clearly made a better impression than the others. That was the consensus commentariat view, but also the finding of a snap poll too. But mostly debates just confirm impressions that are already fairly well lodged in the minds of people who already have a view on the candidates. They don’t “move the dial” much, although they do show how a candidate’s pitch might be evolving. Sunday night’s fell more into that category. Liz Truss and Penny Mordaunt would be said to have done best – but only in the sense that they were most improved from last Friday, when they were both surprisingly unimpressive (Truss because she was wooden, Mordaunt because she was shallow). Truss admitted as much on Sunday night, when she accepted she might not be the most polished of performers, but stressed her experience. She was much stronger against Sunak than she was on Friday. Mordaunt sounded more confident, but she is struggling to define herself clearly, or quash doubts about her inexperience. Tory polling suggests that, while she may have been very popular with members as the ‘None of the above’ candidate, once she is just the Penny Mordaunt candidate, it is less appealing. But Sunak probably did best on a more conventional assessment. He sounded the most polished and authoritative, and he has got through two debates now as the frontrunner in the parliamentary contest without being tripped up. For the second time in a row, he probably came off best in the economics debate with Truss by deploying a pithy soundbite (“‘something for nothing economics”). His one-on-one question to Truss later was also the closest the debate came to real zinger: “You have been a Liberal Democrat and a remainer. Which one do you regret the most?” And Kemi Badenoch also did well because, of the three effective insurgent candidates (people who did not serve in Boris Johnson’s cabinet), she is the most articulate, the least predictable, and the one with the most momentum. Notice how she was starting to adopt Sunak’s pitch on the economy, stressing that – like him – she considers tackling inflation the real challenge. On Friday, Tugendhat was the candidate who sounded like he most represented a clean start and a breath of fresh air. But second time round that pitch did not have quite the same appeal, and he sounded like someone who expects to be out of the contest by this time tomorrow night.","Id":"politics/2022/jul/17/tory-leadership-candidates-second-tv-debate-verdict","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"How well did the Tory leadership candidates do in the second TV debate? | Andrew Sparrow's verdict","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/17/tory-leadership-candidates-second-tv-debate-verdict","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/17/tory-leadership-candidates-second-tv-debate-verdict","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":441,"webPublicationDate":"2022-07-17T19:50:33Z","hosted":false,"id":"politics/2022/jul/17/tory-leadership-candidates-second-tv-debate-verdict"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Bad economics at the BBC enabled Tory austerity and its aftermath – and it knows as much","body":"How different might the last decade of British politics have been if the public had been better informed about economics? It’s the inescapable thought I had when reading through the BBC’s newly published “thematic review” into its coverage of “taxation, public spending, government borrowing and debt output”. Would a public not spoon-fed mush about the supposed perils of government borrowing have been so ready to accept David Cameron and George Osborne’s austerity in the early 2010s? Would Labour’s then leadership have felt so compelled to support spending cuts – a position that helped lay the ground for Jeremy Corbyn’s anti-austerity leadership bid? Might the Brexit vote have gone differently? The review does not hold back. Independent experts Andrew Dilnot and Michael Blastland state clearly that “too many” BBC journalists lack an understanding of “basic economics”. This particularly affects reporting on the central political issue of government debt, with “some journalists” apparently “instinctively” believing all debt to be inherently bad – and therefore failing to appreciate that the role of government debt is “contested and contestable”. Economics coverage matters for all of us. A poorly informed public makes for bad government decisions and, as the IMF’s latest forecast reminds us, Britain’s economic underperformance is in no small part due to poor government choices. Confronted by a complex situation, with a limited understanding of the issues involved, one respondent to the review suggests that reporters rely on simplistic political narratives – party intrigue, or Westminster gossip; meanwhile, assumed authorities are deferred to for the actual economics. Those authorities come to assume an outsized role in reporting, their judgments and analyses imbued with a certainty that they do not, in fact, possess. “The BBC,” the review notes, should not “feel it can subcontract judgment about what is reasonable or impartial to a few established names”, including the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Bank of England. The result is journalists too often framing policy choices, such as making cuts to spending, as if they were decisions of necessity. The review singles out “household analogies” for the government debt, in particular, as “dangerous territory”. We’ve all seen journalists, not just on the BBC, compare government debt and household debt. The claim from the BBC’s former political editor Laura Kuenssberg, for instance, in a BBC News broadcast of November 2020, that the government’s “credit card” was “maxed out” was a classic of the type – and sparked the complaints by well-known economists that led to the review being commissioned. Government borrowing has little in common with the borrowing that you or I engage in since, as the review puts it, “states don’t tend to retire or die, or pay off their debts entirely”. Nor do ordinary people typically have a money printing machine in their front room to pay their debts with, unlike the government and the Bank of England. Journalists reporting on economics, as the review accepts, need pithy metaphors for complex processes. But in this case, the conceptual leap from government financing to household borrowing distorts the truth. Worse, the metaphor almost necessarily lends itself to supporting government spending cuts – a position that tends to find the most support on the political right. There are reputable economic arguments for austerity. “Expansionary fiscal contraction”, as developed by the political economist Alberto Alesina and others, was one of them. A decade of experience suggests that it was terribly wrong, but this was at least a coherent argument, based on a recognisable economic logic. That case could have been presented, alongside opposing views, as part of an effort to promote public debate and understanding of the issues around the public finances. The review points out that genuinely impartial reporting would show that different choices can be made around economy policy. The BBC occupies a unique position – it’s both the most popular source for all news and among the most trusted single source of news. How it chooses to report that news has an enormous impact. Related: If the Murdoch press is so panicked about recession, why did it back austerity and Brexit? | Polly Toynbee That means this report is an opportunity to dramatically improve the quality of the UK’s public debate on economic issues. Already, there are signs of change: the BBC seriously questioned the briefly popular rhetoric of “fiscal black holes”, which flourished after Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-budget implosion last September. Recently, the BBC News website has raised questions about the reliability of economic forecasting. More of this, and we may see a better informed public, and more robust, enlightening debate. This country has been badly damaged by having its politics bent around a few bad unsupported claims about how the economy works. The BBC says its director general will be drawing up an “action plan”. At a minimum, this should address the lack of training for its journalists in economics issues, and encourage broader range of expertise in reporting. Other journalists are already taking note. The next few years are likely to be extremely challenging for the British economy. We will need a public service broadcaster able to report difficult and contested economic issues accurately, fairly and impartially.

It was shouty, there were technical problems, the cost of lettuce came up yet again ... but here are the main points: We should try not to pay too much attention to online polls. Prime minister Scott Morrison and Labor leader Anthony Albanese went toe to toe a few times. The climate wars are far from over – the cost of electricity transmission saw the pair bicker bitterly. Morrison still can’t define what the “red line” is when it comes to the Solomon Islands-China security agreement. Both leaders say they have answers on reducing the cost-of-living pressures. Morrison says it’s the economy and jobs, Albanese says it’s wages, childcare and Medicare. Morrison says he’s never witnessed any corruption in the Liberal party and stuck to his existing exposure draft as his party’s plan for a federal integrity commission. He also conceded he shouldn’t have said the vaccine rollout was not a race. He also claimed he “blew the whistle” on aged care neglect (some would argue with that).

There was a 60-second time limit on responses – which an optimistic soul might think would lead to succinct answers. Instead, we got the usual soundbites with the added bonus of Albanese and Morrison engaging in something akin to a fish slapping dance. There were very good, serious questions on policy substance. And then there was a question about the definition of a female, stoking the anti-trans wars lit by Warringah candidate Katherine Deves. The debate ended with a question on televising sports, which seems entirely irrelevant until you consider who hosted the shindig. Is anyone nostalgic for the worm?

It is a choice between a government that has a strong economic plan, that has ensure that Australia is coming out of this pandemic stronger than almost any [other country] in the world today, with unemployment falling, a triple-A credit rating and a budget turned around by over $100bn in the last 12 months, so we can provide real cost-of-living relief. A plan that is investing in small businesses. In skills, in infrastructure. Investing in the better roads, and ensuring the essential services you can rely on, whether it is Medicare, the national disability insurance scheme, because we know how to run a strong economy. We are a known quantity, and at a time of great uncertainty, now is not the time to risk things on the unknown. Labor have no plan, they are unknown, and a small target is always a big risk and I think over the course of this campaign, as they have put forward what they have been talking about, Australians have been seeing and asking the question, are they really up to this, and is Mr Albanese really up to this? You know what we have achieved together and we can keep achieving that by sticking to that strong plan, because a strong economy means a strong future. Scott Morrison speaks. Photograph: Alex Ellinghausen/AAP Updated at 1.19pm BST 1.04pm BST They’ve moved on from the discussion about “doing deals” (neither leader really answered that question – Morrison had a crack about Labor signing a deal with the Greens). And the final question was on sports being broadcast on free to air (there’ll be a review). Now on to final statements. Updated at 1.08pm BST 1.02pm BST Albanese says Labor’s the only party trying to form government in its own right (because the Liberal party only rules in the Coalition with the Nationals). Morrison: “We are both doing that.” Albanese: “You are not, you are part of a Coalition with Barnaby Joyce.” Morrison: “And we have been since 1944.” Updated at 1.08pm BST 1.00pm BST Morrison is asked if he’d resign if that’s what it took for the “teal” independents to form a minority government with the Coalition. A hung parliament would be “great chaos, great chaos”, he says. Knight asks if he will be replaced with defence minister Peter Dutton if the teals demand that he go. He’s ducking and weaving. He says: We will not be doing details on policies that we don’t support. Updated at 1.07pm BST 12.58pm BST Morrison is asked about that stage in the pandemic when Australian citizens were stopped from returning – particularly from India. It was “for a very brief period of time”, he says. “That was done on the basis of medical advice.” It wasn’t just people from India, though ... Morrison: One of the things we did together with the state governments, right from the outset, is we agreed to put in place a quarantine system that was done with the states through hotels, which massively increased the capacity for us to have people come to Australia. The scene at Nine studios in Sydney tonight. Photograph: Alex Ellinghausen/AAP Updated at 1.20pm BST 12.56pm BST Albanese has used the phrase “outrageous slur” a couple of times against accusations of Labor being too friendly with Beijing. Morrison is throwing accusations around about deputy leader Richard Marles and a speech he made in 2019 – you can read all about it here. Updated at 1.00pm BST 12.54pm BST Solomons deal a 'massive foreign policy failure', Albanese says The Solomon Islands deal was a “massive foreign policy failure”, Albanese says, adding that the Coalition sold the port of Darwin to the Chinese Communist party. *Insert minutes of the two men shouting at each other here* Updated at 1.00pm BST 12.52pm BST PM pressed to define 'red line' on Solomon Islands On to the Solomon Islands-China security agreement now. What is the “red line” Morrison has talked about? Morrison: It means that was something Australia believes would be completely against our national interest, and we also believe it will be against the Solomon Islands’ national interest. Everyone has a clear position, he says. The red line means everyone has a “clear understanding” of those positions. We would work with our partners to prevent an outcome, he says. (No, I’m still not clear on the red line either.) Updated at 12.56pm BST 12.49pm BST Morrison is asked if he accepts responsibility for the neglect in aged care: It occurred over 30 years, that is exactly what the royal commission has said. Over the last nine years, the Labor government before that, and the previous Liberal government before that. The problem is a very difficult, and we all know what the problems are. The solutions are very difficult. Albanese says he only caved to pressure from Labor to call a royal commission. Updated at 12.54pm BST 12.48pm BST Albanese is asked if he can guarantee finding enough nurses to fulfil his pledge to have nurses in every nursing home, and 215 minutes of care for residents. He says: We will, we will deliver on our policies. Updated at 12.50pm BST 12.47pm BST Albanese is asked about the death of senator Kimberley Kitching, and allegations she was bullied by Labor colleagues: Well, the death of Kimberley Kitching is a tragedy. She was just 52 years of age. The procedures that are in place have been in place for some time. I have the utmost confidence in my frontbench. And from time to time in politics, the truth is, that in terms of the issue that has been raised about a committee position, from time to time there is conflict, more people want positions than are available. That happens. My experience with Kimberley Kitching was she was making an outstanding contribution. I put her on the frontbench. I kept her on the frontbench. I think it is a tragedy that she was lost, particularly to her family and her close friends but to the Labor family as well, far too early. Updated at 12.50pm BST 12.45pm BST Morrison concedes the situation in parliament has not been fixed: No, I don’t believe it has been resolved. I don’t believe it has been resolved ... Do I believe it is fixed? I don’t think it is fixed in any workplace around the country. Updated at 12.49pm BST 12.44pm BST Knight asks Morrison if he has a woman problem. Morrison says his government is helping survivors of domestic violence and women suffering post-natal depression, and: This morning I was with Jenny and we were down in Melbourne and we announced our policy to ensure that women who are suffering from cancer or have genetic diseases who could transmit ... we are supporting them to freeze their embryos, and others, so that when they are facing cancer they will not also face the terrible disappointment that one day they may not be able to have children. Updated at 12.45pm BST 12.43pm BST Oh help. Now both leaders have been asked what the definition of a woman is (obviously buying into the trans “debate” sparked by Liberal candidate Katherine Deves). Albanese: “An adult female.” Morrison: “A member of the female sex.” Updated at 12.44pm BST 12.41pm BST Morrison is trying to paint Labor’s help-to-buy scheme as a “forced-to-sell” scheme. Morrison says people might have to pay back that shared equity if they get a job. Albanese says that’s not true. Updated at 12.43pm BST 12.40pm BST Albanese asks Morrison if he supports the minimum wage for all workers, and Morrison distinguishes people on a wage from people like small business owners, “when the money is not coming in”. What about gig workers? Morrison says: They are working for themselves, that’s why they do it. Updated at 12.43pm BST 12.39pm BST That “better way” Albanese is talking about is Labor’s housing policy. They’re on to the shared equity scheme for housing that Labor has promised. Albanese points out that Morrison has supported shared equity in the past, when the Victorian government brought in a scheme. That was a state scheme, not a federal one, Morrison says. He never favoured a federal one (yeah, good luck parsing that). Updated at 12.42pm BST 12.37pm BST Morrison’s question to Albanese is about his position changes on a range of issues, including negative gearing, tax cuts, boat turnbacks, etc: Given you have changed your mind on so things you are passionately against, how can Australians believe you are now for them? Albanese says Labor found a “better way”: We had a range of policies that we put forward that were not successful. Updated at 12.42pm BST 12.35pm BST Morrison admits he should not have said vaccine rollout was 'not a race' And we’re back. Now a question from Albanese to Morrison. We’ve both had Covid, he says, and gives thanks to the science. You said it wasn’t a race, Albanese says: Do you now accept that indeed it was a race, and you should have secured vaccines earlier? Morrison gives ground: We shouldn’t have described it in those terms. “Yes, it’s true ... we had our setbacks,” he says: But we came back, we got the vaccines and we now have one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, as well as one of the stronger economies and one of the lowest death rates from Covid. A lot of people would have liked to have been in Australia when it came to coming through the Covid pandemic. Updated at 12.41pm BST 12.32pm BST #Newspoll Federal 2 Party Preferred: L/NP 46 (-1) ALP 54 (+1) #ausvotes — GhostWhoVotes (@GhostWhoVotes) May 8, 2022 12.31pm BST First result in viewer poll: 26pc of voters are undecided. #auspol https://t.co/rB9YpjGgdT — Paul Osborne (@osbornep) May 8, 2022 12.31pm BST Everyone’s probably watching this on different platforms, but I’m getting Labor attack ads in this short break in the leaders’ debate. 12.28pm BST Albanese is talking about restoring faith in institutions: Our democracy is precious ... we need to make sure that Australians can have faith in it and that is why we need to do whatever we can to create institutions and structures that enhance that faith in our political system. And now both leaders’ voices have gone up an octave or so, they’re talking over each other – it’s not edifying. Morrison is saying Albanese’s federal integrity commission plans are only a couple of pages long and says he’s “hiding in the bushes”. Albanese says: We will have legislation this year if we are elected. Updated at 12.34pm BST 12.25pm BST No one really likes either of you, Knight says. Morrison says it’s not about whether or not you like someone: It is a choice about who you think has the economic plan and the strength to lead the country at a time which is almost unprecedented. Nine’s political editor Chris Uhlmann, 2GB afternoon host Deborah Knight and chief political correspondent David Crowe put questions to the pair. Photograph: Alex Ellinghausen/AAP Updated at 1.26pm BST 12.24pm BST Albanese points out the backlash to Morrison’s comments that the NSW Icac was a “kangaroo court”: We need to make sure that we restore faith in the integrity of our political system. I think, overwhelmingly, people go into politics across the spectrum for all the right reasons. They go in to take their view about how they help their fellow Australians in the best way possible. But the truth is, there is a stench around Canberra at the moment. Updated at 12.28pm BST 12.23pm BST PM says he has never witnessed any corruption Crowe asks Morrison point blank if he’s witnessed any corruption. “I haven’t,” says Morrison. Crowe follows up with a question about whether that’s why he’s reluctant to implement a federal integrity commission. Morrison then outlines the exposure draft his government has created, but not put to parliament. Crowe then asks him about findings from the NSW Icac and Morrison says: You are assuming I have some knowledge or awareness or involvement in those issues which I clearly do not. Updated at 12.25pm BST 12.21pm BST Morrison says he has 'brought his party together' on net zero Morrison is asked if he’s divisive: We have not seen the revolving door under my leadership. I brought my party together, brought my Coalition together, brought my Coalition together by getting to net zero by 2050, that is something that took a lot of leadership to bring my party together in the unity. Which leads naturally to a skirmish over climate change targets, with Albanese saying Morrison can’t be more ambitious because Barnaby Joyce won’t let him. Updated at 12.24pm BST 12.19pm BST Knight puts to Albanese that people still don’t know who he is. He says: I think Australians know what I stand for. I had the same values my entire life. The values of supporting a fair day’s pay for a [day’s] work. The values of supporting essential universal services, such as Medicare, supporting universal superannuation ... I came out [of the womb] with three great faiths, the Labor party, the Catholic church and the South Sydney rugby league football club and I remain true to all three. Updated at 12.23pm BST 12.17pm BST 'Why don't people trust you, Mr Morrison?' The prime minister says it’s been a tough three years: Particularly the last two years, and I know over that period of time there would have been many disappointments, people would have disagreed with many things I did and would have a different view about how things might have been managed. So I can understand the hurt and the feelings that people have had coming out of a time like this. That can lead them to feel bad about the government’s and bad about the government’s and bad about their leaders as we have seen in many places around the world, so I understand that. Uhlmann points out the direct criticisms from people including Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells and deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce. Morrison: From time to time, I will disagree with people and they won’t agree with the position I am taking. Updated at 12.23pm BST 12.15pm BST Uhlmann has brought up Albanese’s stumble on listing the six points of Labor’s NDIS plan. He’s implying that Albanese lied about knowing the policy (and refers to accusations that Morrison routinely lies). Albanese says “that’s not right”: The question of the NDIS isn’t about a number of points, what it is about is how do you fix the NDIS, and Labor created the national disability insurance scheme. We are very concerned that people are having their programs cut. Updated at 12.18pm BST 12.13pm BST Still on young people, Crowe asks Morrison about the younger generation who will shoulder the debt burden. The answer? Jobs: We took action and, yes, we had to borrow to do that ... had we not borrowed, the Australian economy would not look like it does today and I think Australians understand that and that is why they supported those programs. But the biggest thing I think we can do for young Australians to make sure they get jobs. Updated at 12.17pm BST 12.12pm BST On to the housing crisis now. Crowe asks Albanese what Labor will do to help (specifically) young people. Albanese outlines the general housing plans (Crowe comes back to emphasise he was interested in young people). Albanese: Young people are doing it really tough, no doubt about that. In order to address housing, what you need is a comprehensive plan and we have that. We have that in terms of increased investment in social housing. We have that 20,000 additional housing dwellings. We have a plan for 10,000 affordable housing units for essential workers. We also have a plan for emergency housing and a range of other areas but we also have our help to buy scheme which would enable low- and middle-income earners to have that assistance with a shared equity scheme. Updated at 12.13pm BST 12.10pm BST Heated exchange over energy transmission costs Morrison and Albanese are shouting over each other about the costs of transmission within the energy network. Albanese says transmission is an investment, and Morrison says that cost gets passed on to consumers. Morrison: How much more will you spend on transmission? Then they have to recover that from the consumers and prices go up. It is recovered from the consumers and they pay the electricity prices which meant prices go up. It is 30% of the bill. Albanese says there is not an energy economist who would agree with that: The low-hanging fruit, you have not addressed in the low-hanging fruit when it comes to fixing energy in this country – fixing energy in this country is fixing transmission. Updated at 12.12pm BST 12.08pm BST We brought the budget back into balance before the pandemic, Morrison says. But that expenditure (which took Australia deep into red territory) is what has ensured the economy is back on track now: Getting debt and deficit under control means you keep reducing your deficit over time. The Labor party have said they will have higher deficits than us, and what we will be doing is ensuring that we will be doing is ensuring ... exactly like last time, we have balanced the budget once ... Then Morrison is out of time, and Albanese points out that debt had doubled before the pandemic. Updated at 12.10pm BST 12.05pm BST Morrison attacks 'irresponsible' emissions targets Morrison says power prices have dropped 10% under his government, and that the Coalition is helping consumers get better deals. Coal prices were driving up wholesale prices, he says, and those will now come down: What we have done is actually cut electricity prices. Under the Labor party, electricity prices more than doubled when they were last in. And he has a whack at “irresponsible targets to reduce emissions”. And who said the climate wars were over? Updated at 12.11pm BST 12.03pm BST Albanese can’t guarantee wages will rise faster than inflation if he wins government. He says: Our objective is to have real wage increases and we have practical plans to do that. He says Labor will put in a submission to the Fair Work Commission for a pay rise in aged care, will support an increase in minimum wages, and will address the gender pay gap. Updated at 12.05pm BST 12.02pm BST Crowe points out that Labor has backed much of the Coalition’s spending plans. Albanese says Labor’s spending will increase productivity: The priority we have had in terms of our investments have been in areas which will grow productivity, which will grow the economy in a way that doesn’t put pressure on inflation. Take, for example, childcare and it is one of the reasons why our childcare plan has been backed in so strongly by the business community. Updated at 12.09pm BST 12.00pm BST Crowe asks Morrison if he takes any responsibility for interest rates rises. Morrison says, in short, no. He says Treasury and Reserve Bank of Australia governor Philip Lowe have backed that, and uses the well-worn line that Australia is doing better than other developed nations. He says Australia has more “downward pressure” than comparable countries: That is because our economic plan is getting people into work, giving people confidence, businesses are investing, business is getting back on its feet and you cannot take that for granted. Updated at 12.09pm BST 11.58am BST Albanese has switched the conversation to wages. He says: The problem is, there has never been more Australians working in insecure work than there are at the moment, we have seen this plethora of growth in labour hire and contracting, we have 500,000Australians who are working three or more jobs. They are not doing that out of choice... they are doing that to try to get by and that is why one of the things we need to do is to address wages. 11.57am BST Both leaders confirm the fuel excise cut will be temporary Neither will commit to maintaining that cut to the fuel excise. Albanese first responded that the AAA rating was achieved under Labor, and points out that the cut to the fuel excise will expire in September. Morrison says other measures will continue. But those fuel prices are set to go up again in a few months. Updated at 12.10pm BST 11.55am BST Sarah Abo asks the leaders to commit to truth in this critical debate, then asks what the parties can actually do to help with cost-of-living pressures (including lettuce and flowers). Albanese: [Our economic plan] makes sure that we prioritise productivity so that we are not placing upward pressure on inflation, so our plan, which consists of powering Australia for cheaper energy, which consists of fixing the NBN, it infrastructure, investment, cheaper childcare and making more things here is all aimed at growing the economy in the way that does not put additional pressure on inflation. They are the sort of measures you can do that will make a practical difference to people’s lives. Morrison talks about global “upward pressures”: Australia has maintained a AAA credit rating, one of only nine countries in the world to do so during the pandemic. And that means ... we can cut the fuel tax, meaning we can pay $250 to pensioners and others on fixed incomes and $420 that Australians could keep more of what they earn when they put their tax return in on 1 July. We cannot control all the forces that are coming from overseas, but what we can do, by managing money well, that puts downward pressure on inflation, managing money well means we can invest in ... the essential services. Updated at 12.03pm BST 11.52am BST Labor leader Anthony Albanese echoes the Mother’s Day wishes, and says Australia “can’t afford” three more years of the same government. He kicks off with Labor’s childcare and Medicare promises: We will have cheaper childcare, we will have stronger Medicare including with cheaper medicines to make it easier to see a doctor. We will have more secure work and we have a plan to lift wages. We also have a plan for clean energy through renewables. We can have cleaner, cheaper energy driving advanced manufacturing here, bringing back jobs, having a more resilient economy here so we can stand on our own two feet. And we can train Australians for those jobs, with the free Tafe and additional university places and we need to fix the crisis in aged care – and it was summed up in the interim report with a one-word statement, “neglect”, in its title. Updated at 11.54am BST 11.50am BST Prime minister Scott Morrison opens by wishing everyone a happy Mothers’ Day. His pitch is that the election is a choice about a stronger economy or a weaker one. He says he is “incredibly optimistic about Australia’s future”: This is a choice between strength and weakness, a choice between certainty and uncertainty. What you know about the government and what you don’t know about the Labor party and the opposition who have had three years to tell you but haven’t. So today, tonight, it is all about a choice between who can best manage that economy for a stronger future, because a strong economy means a stronger future. Updated at 11.53am BST 11.48am BST The debate begins Here we go! Apart from opening statements (which are 90 seconds) answers will be kept to 60 seconds. Updated at 11.57am BST 11.46am BST This is wildly funny. I am looking at a Lego man on a Lego toilet while waiting for a potential prime minister to debate the other potential prime minister. 11.44am BST And it starts with a toss (no jokes, pls): The coin toss has spoken.

The first was on Sky News, tonight’s is on the Nine Network, and on Wednesday the final tussle before 21 May will be on Channel 7.

It seems quite jolly. Meanwhile, here is the latest Ipsos poll, showing Labor ahead of the Coalition at 57 to 43, two-party-preferred.

Less than two weeks out from election day, prime minister Scott Morrison and Labor leader Anthony Albanese will face questions from Nine’s chief political correspondent David Crowe, political editor Chris Uhlmann, and 2GB afternoon host Deborah Knight. 60 Minutes reporter Sarah Abo will moderate. Nine is promising “nothing is off limits”, and says the leaders haven’t been given a heads-up about what questions they will face.

It feels longer. So much longer. Time bends and stalls when you’re in the parallel universe of a Liz Truss speech. She leaves audiences begging for a lethal injection. The other leadership contenders are little better, registering mostly as absences on the space-time continuum. Negative energy. But we are where we are and we have moved on to the first of the televised debates, a weird gameshow where the only audience that counts are the 360 or so Tory MPs who may or may not be watching. The rest of us are merely voyeurs, having no say in which two clowns will still be standing by next Wednesday evening. This is apparently how the UK likes to choose its prime minister these days. Very on brand for a country that has become a laughing stock. First, though, there was a warm-up Zoom hustings on the Conservative Home website. Think a weekly meeting of junior sales reps. Only infinitely more boring. It’s almost as if no one really wants the job. Which would actually suit the rest of us. Related: Five key takeaways from the first Conservative leadership debate The only highlights were the flatlining Truss forgetting to unmute herself – she’s at her most articulate when you can’t hear her – and Ready4Rish! suggesting that his biggest fault is his perfectionism. I’d say a far greater fault was being in charge of an economy that is predicted to have the second lowest growth in the G20. If he was a real perfectionist he’d have made sure we were bottom. The other three – Penny Mordaunt, Tom Tugendhat and Kemi Badenoch – said nothing memorable at all. Which meant they easily came out on top. Come 7.30pm, the Fatuous Five were lined up like The Weakest Link in the Channel 4 studios with Krishnan Guru-Murthy as guest presenter. And what a dismal 90 minutes it was. Desperate as a political sales pitch. Worse as entertainment. On this showing, the gene pool of talent in the Tory party isn’t even a puddle. A great night for the Labour party, if no one else. The first question was one of trust. “I’ve delivered the impossible,” said Truss, blinking rapidly and sounding like a superannuated 1980s Amstrad computer. As AI goes, Liz makes the Maybot look human. At least Theresa May was vaguely aware there was a reality from which she was detached. Truss is just some free floating atoms in search of a personality and ideas. Virtually nothing she said made any sense. And if it did, it was entirely accidental. She is everyone’s preferred comedy candidate. Not that Rish!, Mordaunt or Badenoch could come up with any better reasons why they should be trusted. Resigning from the government months – if not years – after the rest of the country has concluded that Boris Johnson is a lying, narcissistic sociopath isn’t going to win anyone any brownie points. Tugendhat won the first applause of the evening by shaking his head and saying The Convict was dishonest. Tugendhat went on to quote Harry Potter and thereafter chose to play the part of the outsider. The wise younger man who was outside the system and who could afford to tell the truth. Not that it mattered much as he is going to be out of the contest on Monday. Nor did anyone pay much attention to Badenoch after she had had her five minutes kicking lumps out of Mordaunt over the culture wars as she too isn’t a bona fide contender. So most of the rest of the debate consisted of Liz fantasising about uncosted tax cuts and trying to sound human – next time out, someone should restore her to her factory default settings – and Mordaunt sounding surprisingly wooden and clueless. Someone should teach her to smile and not talk in banalities. She even forgot her own promises to cut tax. Just trying not to screw up on live TV is setting the bar a little low for a wannabe prime minister. All of which left the hopeless Rish! sounding like the voice of experience and the only person you might conceivably trust with running the country. But only because the rest were no hopers or out of their heads on Mogadon. Terrifying really. Still, we can only hope that Tory MPs are stupid enough to coalesce around Liz. After all, we’re fucked regardless. So we may as well go down with a laugh. Guardian Newsroom: who will succeed Boris Johnson?

Historians, some veterans and retired memorial staff, including ex-directors, have long criticised the institution’s acceptance of money from arms manufacturers, saying a body designed to commemorate Australia’s war dead should not be funded by companies that profit from conflict. The criticism has done little to dissuade the memorial from continuing to accept such funding. Related: ‘Deeply offensive’: Australian War Memorial urged not to renew BAE sponsorship Figures released to the Senate show it has taken $803,785.98 in sponsorship funding from Boeing, Leidos, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Thales since 2020-21, usually to fund special exhibitions. Boeing was by far the biggest funder of the memorial, providing $350,149 for three exhibitions. It separately gave a $28,000 donation for the memorial’s 2022 Remembrance Day dinner, the figures show, which critics described as “just plain offensive”. Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, which enjoyed surges in their stocks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, handed the memorial $233,636 and $34,000 respectively. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Lockheed Martin’s money helped fund a $120,000 veteran podcast series examining the experiences of soldiers in modern conflicts, including veterans of the Afghanistan war. The company profited significantly from the Afghanistan conflict, manufacturing the Black Hawk helicopters used extensively there. The AWM council chair, Kim Beazley, who was appointed in December, said such sponsorship was “important for presentation and events of a special character outside the normal operational budget”. “Our partnership policy does not provide any direction of content by donors,” he said. “We don’t charge for entry to what is a costly but superb presentation of an important facet of our national life and fulfilling an obligation to acknowledge and respect those who served.” But the Greens senator David Shoebridge, who obtained the information about memorial sponsorship through budget estimates, said the practice was “deeply troubling”. “How can the war memorial be consistent with ‘never again’ when it accepts funding from weapons manufactures that literally profit from killing soldiers?” he said. “The Australian War Memorial should never take money from arms manufacturers who are responsible for the killing of the people the memorial is seeking to commemorate. It’s simple, really.” The Medical Association for Prevention of War, which campaigns against the memorial’s acceptance of weapons companies’ money, said the contributions from arms manufacturers were small relative to the memorial’s budget. But they allowed the companies to gain valuable corporate branding and media recognition, program and activity naming rights, and invitations and attendance allocations to major ceremonies. Related: Australian War Memorial seeks new funding from Lockheed Martin despite veterans’ criticism “The paltry amounts that the weapons companies give to the Memorial – about $228,500 total for the last financial year – are a tiny percentage of the institution’s budget, and yet they are sufficient to essentially buy a range of benefits,” said the association’s president, Dr Sue Wareham. Wareham said she welcomed Beazley’s appointment , given his views on the need to commemorate the frontier wars. But she did not expect a similar change on the issue of arms manufacturing sponsorship – Beazley is still on the board of the defence contractor Luerssen Australia and was formerly on the board of Lockheed Martin. “It is likely to reinforce the memorial’s deeply inappropriate practice of accepting funding from the very industry that most profits from wars – the weapons industry,” she said. The former Liberal leader Brendan Nelson, a former AWM director and previous council chair, prompted controversy during his tenure for saying weapons companies had a responsibility to help tell the story of “what is being done in the name of our country”. Nelson took a role with the arms manufacturer Thales during his directorship and a job with Boeing after his departure.","Id":"australia-news/2023/feb/15/australian-war-memorial-accepted-more-than-830000-from-weapons-manufacturers-in-three-years","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Australian War Memorial accepted more than $830,000 from arms manufacturers in three years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/15/australian-war-memorial-accepted-more-than-830000-from-weapons-manufacturers-in-three-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/feb/15/australian-war-memorial-accepted-more-than-830000-from-weapons-manufacturers-in-three-years","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":627,"webPublicationDate":"2023-02-14T14:00:19Z","hosted":false,"id":"australia-news/2023/feb/15/australian-war-memorial-accepted-more-than-830000-from-weapons-manufacturers-in-three-years"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Albanese wins final election debate over Morrison, according to Seven’s undecided voters","body":"Anthony Albanese has been declared the winner of the final leaders’ debate of the election campaign after he and Scott Morrison put forward competing views on wage rises, economic management and energy policy. With less than a fortnight until polling day, about 150 undecided voters determined Albanese the clear winner of the Channel Seven debate on Wednesday night. The Labor leader convinced 50% of those who voted in the network’s “pub test” compared with 34% for Morrison and 16% who remained undecided. In a tightly managed discussion, the debate initially focused on the issue of wage increases that had dominated the campaign trail on Wednesday. Pressed on his remarks supporting pay rises for those on the minimum wage, Albanese said the Fair Work Commission was independent of government but he would welcome a decision that saw wage increases match inflation. Related: ‘Over-the-top alarmism’: economists dismiss concerns wage rises cause inflation “What we have said throughout this campaign is that we don’t want people to be left behind,” Albanese said. “If the increase is less than the inflation rate then what that means is they will be getting a real wage cut – and they deserve better than that.” The Labor leader rejected suggestions a 5% pay increase would damage the economy, saying it was the equivalent of the cost of two cups of coffee a day. “We need to look after people who are vulnerable. We need to do more than say, ‘Thanks very much for everything you did in the pandemic but now we are going to cut your wages.’” When asked how much of a pay rise low-income earners deserved, Morrison said the Fair Work Commission was “the right place to do that”. “The economy needs stability and it needs certainty, particularly with the many things that are pressuring down on the economy today,” he said. “I’d welcome pay rises obviously for all workers, not just those on the minimum wages, but we need to have an economy that’s strong into the future and if you have wages that rise at 5.1%, which is exactly what Mr Albanese said yesterday, that means that can feed into inflation which pushes up interest rates and pushes up the cost of living even more.” default The prime minister argued that small business owners would not be able to afford a 5% pay increase and jobs would be lost. “People won’t be worrying about what their wages are, they will be worrying about whether they have a job,” Morrison said. The two leaders were asked what they would do to keep a lid on interest rates and to ease the cost-of-living pressures facing families. Morrison said the government had kept “downward pressure” on interest rates through good economic management, while Albanese spoke about the AAA credit rating achieved when federal Labor was last in power. The moderator, Channel Seven’s political editor, Mark Riley, told Morrison he was “smashing out the talking points” after he listed budget measures aimed at easing cost-of-living pressures, including fuel tax relief and previously legislated income tax cuts. When asked about energy policy – and to guarantee that they would not introduce a mining or carbon tax – Morrison stood by his description of the safeguard mechanism as a “sneaky carbon tax”, saying Albanese intended to lower the threshold that would add prices to mineral, oil, gas and cement production. The safeguard mechanism was introduced by the Coalition in 2014 but has failed to cut industrial emissions as it was initially intended – something Labor is promising to fix. Albanese ruled out introducing a carbon or mining tax and sought to pivot to the commonwealth’s support of Clive Palmer in a court case that challenged WA’s pandemic border closures. “Scott Morrison – when he had a choice between Mark McGowan and Clive Palmer – he chose Clive Palmer,” Albanese said. “He went to court as part of that, with the solicitor general, he spent taxpayers’ money backing up Clive Palmer’s legal case to open up WA’s borders.” The two leaders acknowledged there was “disillusionment” in the community that had led to a rising number of people leaning towards independents, with Albanese using the question to advocate for a national integrity commission. “We need to restore faith in politics,” he said. Asked for his explanation for the trend, Morrison said the past few years had been “incredibly tough” throughout the pandemic, which had “greatly disrupted” both society and community, but this was not a time to risk change. “A vote for the independents may be well-meaning, but it would be a vote to weaken parliament and weaken Australia,” Morrison said. Related: Australian election briefing: Albanese kicks into the wind while Morrison is called a mongrel – plus Barnaby’s nosebleed Morrison faced sustained questions from Riley about a $500,000 payout made to Alan Tudge’s former media adviser Rachelle Miller, with whom Tudge had a relationship, asking why taxpayers could not know further details. The prime minister said that the payment had not yet been settled and defended his handling of the issue, saying he had held an independent inquiry and acted “swiftly”. “People who have relationships in the office that’s something I’ve never approved of,” the prime minister said, reiterating that Tudge would return as education minister in his cabinet if the Coalition won the 21 May election. Albanese said transparency was needed and it was “extraordinary” that there was doubt in the election campaign about who was the education minister. In the final question of the night, the two leaders were asked to nominate something they respected about the other. “The thing about Anthony I’ve always admired – he has never forgotten where he has come from,” Morrison said. “He grew up in housing commission … and he has shown the ability to rise to be the leader of one of the oldest parties in this country.” Albanese acknowledged the job of prime minister was “obviously a difficult one to do” and said he admired Morrison’s commitment to the country. “And on a range of issues, to name one, mental health in terms of young people,” the Labor leader said. “We have seen increased funding for mental health.”","Id":"australia-news/2022/may/11/albanese-wins-final-election-debate-over-morrison-according-to-sevens-undecided-voters","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Albanese wins final election debate over Morrison, according to Seven’s undecided voters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/11/albanese-wins-final-election-debate-over-morrison-according-to-sevens-undecided-voters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/may/11/albanese-wins-final-election-debate-over-morrison-according-to-sevens-undecided-voters","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":992,"webPublicationDate":"2022-05-11T13:51:46Z","hosted":false,"id":"australia-news/2022/may/11/albanese-wins-final-election-debate-over-morrison-according-to-sevens-undecided-voters"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"UK ‘not out of the woods yet’ after economy dodges recession by a whisker; Russia cuts oil output – as it happened","body":"3.17pm GMT Closing summary Time for a recap, after a day in which the UK very narrowly avoided falling into a technical recession. Today’s GDP report has shown that the UK economy stagnated in the final quarter of 2022, narrowly avoiding a recession despite output shrinking by more than expected in December. The economy escaped a recession in 2022 by “the skin of its teeth (£77m to be precise)“, says Paul Dales of Capital Economics. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has warned that the UK is not ‘out of the woods’, but also claimed the economy was showing more resilience than expected. Hunt pointed out that the UK grew faster than other G7 countries during 2022 – but it is the only one yet to have recovered all the output lost in the pandemic. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the latest GDP figures should be a “wake-up call” for the Government. In December alone, GDP shrank by 0.5%. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), says: “The economy contracted sharply in December meaning, overall, there was no growth in the economy over the last three months of 2022. “In December public services were hit by fewer operations and GP visits, partly due to the impact of strikes, as well as notably lower school attendance. Meanwhile, the break in Premier League football for the World Cup and postal strikes also caused a slowdown. “However, these falls were partially offset by a strong month for lawyers, growth in car sales and the cold snap increasing energy generation. Several economists predicted the UK economy could contract in the current quarter.

Speaking to broadcasters during a visit in Bolton, Reeves said: “I hope today’s numbers are a wake-up call to the Government because the economy now is just flatlining along the bottom. “We’re the only major G7 economy that is still smaller than it was before the pandemic – and zero growth is not a success. “The Government now urgently need to put in place a real plan for economic growth, as well as tackling the cost-of-living crisis that is affecting so many families and pensioners right now.” 2.38pm GMT Wall Street has opened in the red, following losses in Europe and Asia already today. The S&P 500 index of US shares has dipped by 0.15%, or 6 points, to 4,075 at the open. The jump in the oil price today, after Russia announced it will cut production, has fuelled concerns of a downturn this year. The US bond market is flashing warning signs. The yield, or interest rate, on 10-year American government debt has fallen below the equivalent yield on the two-year bonds. That ‘inversion’ can be a sign that markets are pricing in a recession, as you’d normally expect the 10-year bond to yield more (to reflect the greater risk of lending for 10 years).

In London, the FTSE 100 index is now down 40 points, or 0.5%, at 7870, away from its record highs earlier this week. Innes says: European equities are trading definitively lower today as markets absorb the notion that rates may stay higher for longer and more thoroughly. We also got a weak GDP report out of the UK -- contracting more than consensus expectations in December by 0.5% mom, driven entirely by a decline in services activity and provided a rude wake-up call to FTSE bulls. 1.45pm GMT Jeremy Hunt has said today he can’t afford ‘major’ new scheme to help people with energy bills from April, despite pressure to ditch plans for bills to jump this autumn. Speaking to reporters this morning, Hunt implied that he was going to reject campaigner Martin Lewis’s call to shelve the planned increase, saying that he did not have the scope for a “major new initiative” on energy. Asked if he was ruling out more support for households, he said: We constantly keep the help we can give families under review. But if you’re saying ‘do I think we’re going to have the headroom to make a major new initiative to help people?’, I don’t think the situation would have changed very significantly from the autumn statement, which was just three months ago.

The Guardian reported last month that leading energy suppliers including Scottish Power, Ova and E.ON had stopped reclaiming debts from some prepayment meter customers. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, which is being carved into three new departments, said that all energy firms had agreed to stop the practice. As energy prices have soared, many people are struggling to pay their bills and have fallen into debt. The department said it had asked all suppliers to set out how they were supporting their customers, how many warrants to forcefully enter people’s homes they had applied for and how they would make up for any wrongdoing. Related: UK energy suppliers to end prepayment meter installation in vulnerable homes 1.22pm GMT Over in Moscow, the head of Russia’s central bank has said that the risks of a global recession have decreased. Russian central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina told a press conerence that the Bank had improved its forecasts for Russia’s economy this year. It now believes growth will fall beween -1% and +1% in 2023. Speaking after the Bank of Russia left interest rates unchanged at 7.5% today, Nabiullina said: The opening of China’s economy after the removal of COVID-19 restrictions, the fact that central banks in advanced economies are close to the peak of their interest rate increases, falls in energy prices, primarily in Europe - all of this has a positive effect on developing economies, including Russia’s key trade partners. However, the positive effects of this for Russia will be restrained by sanctions.” Bloomberg reported this week that president Putin’s government has been pressuring Russia’s Central Bank to be “more upbeat” about the country’s economy amid the invasion of Ukraine and international sanctions. 1.13pm GMT The National Crime Agency has delivered what is likely to be disappointing news for campaigners who have alleged that UK banks took part in “industrial-scale forgery”, by faking customer signatures on loan and mortgage agreements to repossess homes and recover debts. The NCA launched an investigation on the request of the Treasury Select Committee back in July 2019, to review claims by the Bank Signature Forgery Campaign (BSFC). After two and a half years, the NCA has told MPs that it found no evidence of a conspiracy or organised criminal racket by lenders: It says: “After careful and thorough examination we have not found evidence of serious or organised crime, or conspiracy to commit fraud or forgery offences that warrant further review and investigation, so will not be taking any further action in relation to these allegations of bank misconduct. “The breakdown of the material does not support the central allegations made by the BSFC, nor does the material identify dishonest intent and gain by UK financial institutions. We know this will come as a disappointment to many of the individuals who have taken the time to share their material with the BSFC.” However, the NCA letter suggests it may have found cases where signatures were potentially reproduced, though it appears to claim this was for” administrative” purposes. While the FCA found “instances where firms had issued communications to customers that had been signed with the same digital signature attributed to different teams and staff” there were no suggestions the practice was ongoing: The NCA says: “Although we find that the material supplied suggests that, to the extent that discrepancies have been identified, signatures were being used for administrative convenience rather than to commit any criminal offence, we do believe the BSFC material highlights matters relating to signatures that need to be addressed.” Now, the NCA is calling for a new policy over how banks use digital signatures on loans and mortgages. “The National Economic Crime Centre will be recommending to partners that a transparent policy position be put in place with regard to the use of digital signatures on customer facing correspondence originating from the banks and their representatives. This should be supported with clear advice available to customers about who to contact if they have queries or complaints in relations to these signatures.” Related: Are banks guilty of faking signatures on British court papers? 1.00pm GMT The UK’s economic performance has been ‘calamitous’, despite avoiding two quarterly contractions in a row, says Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics. Here’s why: No recession on the pedantic definition of two consecutive quarters of falling GDP, but a calamitous performance nonetheless.

This is a recession in all but name. — Samuel Tombs (@samueltombs) February 10, 2023 12.53pm GMT Analysis: UK can expect year of stagnation after narrowest of escapes from recession It was a recession in all but name: that is the conclusion of many economists who argue that while the official data shows the UK economy stood still in the last three months of 2022 rather than contracting, it is still in bad shape, my colleague Phillip Inman writes. To be precise, the economy actually expanded by 0.01% in the fourth quarter, an increase so statistically insignificant that it is rounded down to zero. Had Britain not added just £77m to its £2.2tn gross domestic product (GDP) then it would have fallen into a technical recession, characterised by two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Stagnation is not a good look when there is so much that needs to happen – investment in green infrastructure, for instance – to improve living standards and meet net zero targets. Here’s the full piece: Related: UK can expect year of stagnation after narrowest of escapes from recession Updated at 12.54pm GMT 12.52pm GMT UK escaped recession by £77m Britain’s economy really did come close to dropping into recession in the final quarter of last year. In the end, UK output in Q4 was just £77m away from a contraction, Paul Dales of Capital Economics says. But, Dales also predicts high inflation and high interest rates will trigger a recession this year. Strikes on the trains, in the NHS and at Royal Mail hit the economy, he points out: Health output fell by 2.8% m/m, partly due to fewer GDP appointments during the strikes, transport output was down by 3.1% m/m and arts/entertainment fell by 7.8% m/m (some of which was due to the absence of Premier League football due to the World Cup). But some of the weakening from the +0.1% m/m rise in GDP in November was probably due to some underlying weakness as a result of high inflation and high interest rates. 12.23pm GMT NIESR: It still feels like a recession to most households. This morning’s news that Britain dodged a recession at the end of last year will be “little consolation to most households”, which have seen significant hits to their real incomes over the course of the last year. So says the NIERS thinktank, which predicts today that the economy will shrink by 0.2% in January-March. Paula Bejarano Carbo, associate economist at NIESR, explains: “Today’s ONS figures suggest that monthly GDP fell by 0.5 per cent in December, driven by a 0.8 per cent fall in services which saw significant decreases in human health and social work activities resulting from strikes and a drop-off in vaccination activity. Interestingly, monthly output in consumer-facing services fell by 1.2 per cent in December following growth of 0.4 per cent in November; the ONS associates this surprise with the gains to food and beverage activity from the FIFA World Cup being overtaken by a 17 per cent loss in sports activities, and amusement and recreation activities due to the break in the Premier League. The monthly data suggest that GDP was flat in the fourth quarter of 2022. While this means that the UK avoided a technical recession in 2022 – that is, two consecutive quarters of contracting growth – it is important to remember that it will have felt like a recession for most households as the cost-of-living crisis eroded living standards in the UK.” ⚡️OUT NOW⚡️ Our latest monthly #GDP Tracker suggests little relief expected for #households with GDP set to contract by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2023 ⚠️ Read our analysis in full here \uD83D\uDCCA\uD83D\uDC47\uD83D\uDC47#EconTwitter #UKeconomy#CostOfLivingCrisishttps://t.co/RZEq2A7TWU pic.twitter.com/8tfB1otOSL — National Institute of Economic and Social Research (@NIESRorg) February 10, 2023 12.16pm GMT The government’s energy price guarantee, which capped the unit cost of electricity and gas for households, probably helped the UK avoid falling into recession last quarter. Investec analyst Philip Shaw points out that household consumption eked out a 0.1% gain in real terms in the final quarter of 2022. The Energy Price Guarantee was “undoubtedly” a major support over the period, Shaw explains: In the event, domestic gas and electricity prices rose by 27%. Without the EPG, the increase would actually have been 80%, which would have very probably resulted in a significant fall in consumer spending. The EPG was announced by Liz Truss in September, and meant that typical household bills would rise by about £2,500 a year. Before that, they were on track to jump to £3,549 (although there was no limit on what a customer could pay). Shaw adds: Another point of interest was the 4.8% increase on the quarter in business investment, maintaining its upward trend over the year as a whole, most likely aided by the ‘super deduction’ capital allowances. 11.40am GMT Modupe Adegbembo, G7 Economist at AXA Investment Managers, predicts the UK economy will contract in the current quarter. That would mean nine months without growth. Following today’s GDP report, showing the economy flatlined in Q4 but shrank 0.5% in December, Adegbembo says: The UK economy has narrowly avoided falling into a technical recession in 2022 based on the first quarterly estimate, but growth momentum remains weak, and we expect Q1 growth of -0.3%….. We don’t think this quarter’s stagnation is a precursor of an upcoming pickup in growth momentum; the UK economy remains weak as evidenced by recent deterioration consumer surveys and subdued business surveys, and we expect to see the economy decline further into 2023. 11.10am GMT UK consumer confidence has picked up as people show more optimism about their household finances, polling firm YouGov has reported. It latest survey of the public has found that optimism rose in January, suggesting the economy performed better than feared in the early weeks of 2023. UK consumer confidence Photograph: YouGov The report says: Consumer confidence increased by 2.4 points in January 2023, which is the biggest single month increase since May 2021 Short-term (+5.7) and forward-looking (+10.5) household finance measures saw significant improvements House value measures for the past 30 days (+3.7) and next 12 months (+5.8) also trended upwards Business activity measures for the past 30 days fell by -2.2 points to 106.6, the lowest since February 2021 Confidence in job security fell further by 0.7 points 10.49am GMT Oil price jumps as Russia announces output cut There’s drama in the energy markets this morning. The oil price has jumped by 2.5%, after Moscow announced it will cut oil production, in retaliate against Western sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine. Russia will cut oil production by 500,000 barrels per day, or around 5% of output, in March, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak has announced. The move has been hinted at by the Kremlin, since the European Union and G-7 began discussing capping the price of Russian exports. At the end of December, president Putin banned the supply of crude oil and oil products to nations that impose the cap. Novak says “As of today, we are fully selling the entire volume of oil produced, however, as stated earlier, we will not sell oil to those who directly or indirectly adhere to the principles of the ‘price cap’. “In this regard, Russia will voluntarily reduce production by 500,000 barrels per day in March. This will contribute to the restoration of market relations.” This has pushed Brent crude up by $2 per barrel, to $86.60. That’s the highest since the end of January. Higher energy prices could undermine hopes of bringing inflation down sharply this year. Russia will cut about 5% of its monthly oil output in March in response to the price cap. This is 0.5% of the world supply. Brent crude up 2.5% Things continue to move quickly... — Gold Telegraph ⚡ (@GoldTelegraph_) February 10, 2023 10.42am GMT Analyst: No need to open the fizz after UK avoids recession The sparkling wine can remain on ice after data this morning confirmed the UK avoided a recession at the end of 2022 by the narrowest of margins, cautions Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. There’s every chance that a tiny revision to the data over the next couple of months will confirm quite the opposite, Erlam adds: Ultimately, this isn’t a story of whether the UK is in recession or not as that’s just a simple technical definition. It’s a story of zero growth - quite literally in the case of the fourth quarter - and the fact that this likely represents the recent past, present, and near-term future prospects for the UK economy. High but falling inflation and basically no growth for some time. It’s all a bit bleak really. Of course, that’s better than where we expected to be at this point so that’s a positive. The data towards the end of the year is actually quite difficult to pick apart due to the impact of one-off or temporary events like the world cup, the loss of premier league football, and most importantly, the many, many public sector strikes that continued into the new year. Updated at 10.45am GMT 10.24am GMT Is Jeremy Hunt right that the UK economy is more resilient than expected? Luke Newman, UK equities portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, agrees -saying consumer spending could have been stronger than feared. The UK economy continues to display more resilience than feared with a technical recession avoided despite the headwinds created by the series of public sector strikes, which if adjusted for would actually suggest some underlying economic growth over the quarter. The message we are receiving from domestic consumer facing businesses is that the expected collapse in household spending following Christmas has simply not occurred, and whilst it is too early to call a significant reverse in trend, it does appear as if the UK consumer is in better shape than most economists’ forecasts had suggested following an easing in the headline rates of inflation and some signs of stability in energy markets. But, as Hunt also hints at, 2023 will be tough. Tommaso Aquilante, associate director of economic research at Dun and Bradstreet, warns that businesses will face heavier pressures: “Growing by 4%, the UK economy has proven more resilient than expected in 2022. And yet there is clear evidence of weakening in economic activity, which has stagnated in the fourth quarter. The economy has avoided a recession by just a whisker, but it’s likely to be flirting with one in 2023, and consequently, there are challenges ahead for businesses. “Credit risk has increased significantly, with business liquidations being consistently above pre-pandemic levels for a while. Businesses are going to have to be exceptionally diligent when managing their financial pipeline. To better serve customers and preserve cash flows and ensure businesses are resilient to the challenges ahead, a comprehensive monitoring of risks and opportunities along product lines and supply-chain ramifications is essential.” 10.12am GMT 10.12am GMT When counting to two decimal places, the UK eked out a tiny 0.01% growth in the final quarter of last year, PA Media points out. These figures might be revised in late March when the ONS next looks at GDP, though. 10.04am GMT One piece of good news in today’s GDP report is that that UK economy shrank by less than thought over the summer. The Office for National Statistics now estimates that UK GDP fell by 0.2% in July-September, better than the 0.3% fall in Q3 GDP it estimated in December. The ONS says these revisions can be due to the replacement of forecasts with actual survey or external source data and new seasonal adjustment factors. 9.46am GMT Activity in the UK’s legal profession picked up in December, by 3.1%, today’s GDP data shows. Although that helped keep the country out of a technical recession, it may be a worrying sign – if it’s due to legal disputes over debts, or insolvencies (which jumped last year) Steven Mather, director and lawyer at Leicester-based Steven Mather Solicitor, predicts a rise in insolvencies in 2023. “Lawyers were busy during the fourth quarter as the storm clouds gathered. We’ve seen a significant uptick in business clients needing debt recovery, which doesn’t bode well for the economy. In good times, a business can often overlook a £20k debt or even a £100k debt, but when the economy gets tighter, they start looking at their aged debtors and push harder for payments. Getting on top of aged debt can really help your cash flow but, as the chain upwards may be struggling with cash flow, too, it’s not necessarily easy to get paid. Sadly it’s sometimes the one who shouts loudest who gets paid first. I’m fully expecting insolvencies to increase hugely this year. The issue with insolvency is that there’s often a whole chain of small businesses below as suppliers who are hung out to dry with no likelihood of getting paid which puts pressure on them to pay staff and keep the economy going.” Tahina Akther, barrister and co-founder at London-based Wildcat Law, has seen a rise in businesses looking to exit contracts, or considering filing claims for damages under contract clauses. “Financial legal disputes, which kept lawyers busy in December, are usually a forerunner of a full recession and we saw a spike in enquiries coming through during the final quarter of last year. 9.37am GMT The news that Britain narrowly dodged falling into recession at the end of last year hasn’t brought much cheer to the City of London. The pound is little changed, around $1.211 against the US dollar. It fell to a one-month low below $1.20 earlier this week. The UK’s blue-chip share index, the FTSE 100, has hit several record highs this week. Today, though, it’s down 0.15% at 7898 points. Banking group Standard Chartered are the top FTSE 100 faller, down 4.6%, after the UAE’s largest bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank, insisted it is not evaluating a takeover offer (reports yesterday of a possible bid drove Standard Chartered up). 9.07am GMT The Resolution Foundation agrees that the UK economy is not yet “out of the woods”, after flatlining in the last quarter. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, points out that families are still living through a living standards downturn. “The longer-term picture is more worrying, with the UK economy yet to return to its pre-pandemic size having suffered a prolonged period of weak growth since the financial crisis. “However, falling wholesale gas prices offer hope for households and the wider economy – with inflation on track to fall sharply later this year.” UK narrowly avoids recession amid living standards downturn - @JamesSmithRF responds to the latest @ONS GDP data https://t.co/5HaumCGPuU pic.twitter.com/5t1dv8tNLw — Resolution Foundation (@resfoundation) February 10, 2023 8.58am GMT Video: Hunt says UK economy has underlying resilience Here’s a video clip of chancellor Jeremy Hunt responding to today’s GDP figures. \"We're not out of the woods yet.\" Chancellor Jeremy Hunt says the fact the UK avoided recession in the second half of last year shows the economy has an \"underlying resilience\".

Inflation is still much too high, Hunt warns, and causing pain to families across the country. That’s why the government must stick to its plan to half inflation this year, he says. [that plan includes not paying inflation-beating pay rises to public sector workers]. Controlling the cost of living is the Bank of England’s job, of course – and the BoE has already forecast that inflation will fall sharply this year. Interactive Hunt adds that the UK can be “one of the most prosperous countries in Europe”, if it plays to its strength in science and technology.

Alfie Sterling, chief economist at the New Economics Foundation, shows here how UK GDP is still below its pre-pandemic levels, after three troubled years: \"No technical recession, nothing to see here\". pic.twitter.com/nSL6agBAwE — Alfie Stirling (@alfie_stirling) February 10, 2023 8.30am GMT The 0.5% drop in UK GDP in December was partly caused by the widespread industrial action across the country at the end of 2022, says Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club. Beck explains: Widespread industrial action probably explains a large part of December’s fall in activity. There is likely to have been a substantial direct impact on some sectors. For example, shutdowns across the rail network will have weighed heavily on output in the transport sector. There’s also likely to have been an indirect impact from the transport disruption, both in terms of stopping people getting to work and compromising their ability to engage in leisure activities. EY ITEM Club, a forecasting group, thinks GDP may dip further in the first half of 2023. The cost of living squeeze, higher interest rates, and tax increases will all hit growth, as Beck says: The ongoing squeeze on household spending power from high inflation will weigh on consumer spending, while the combination of pressure on profitability and the uncertain outlook makes for a challenging backdrop for business investment. In addition, policy settings will be tight, with a significantly tightening of fiscal policy due to be implemented from April and much of the impact of higher interest rates still to feed through. 8.16am GMT Deloitte: we expect GDP contraction this year Today’s GDP report is only the first estimate of what happened in the economy in the last quarter of 2022. So there’s a risk that the report is revised in coming months, as more data comes in from across the economy, says Debapratim De, senior economist at Deloitte: “The UK avoided a recession last year but by the slimmest of margins. Going by recent data revisions, today’s figures could well be revised downwards in a few months, painting a very different picture for growth. “Recession or not, UK growth has stagnated for some time now. Despite the marginal improvement in sentiment over the last few weeks, we continue to forecast a contraction in GDP this year.” 8.14am GMT The UK has dodged the technical definition of a recession by “a hair’s breadth”, says Laura Suter, head of personal finance at AJ Bell: “The government will pounce on these figures as an example of why the IMF and other economists’ predictions of UK economic doom are too downbeat, no doubt latching onto the fact that we’re not in a technical recession. And, perhaps more worryingly for the UK public, the Bank of England may well see this as a sign that they can go higher and harder with rate rises at their next meeting. “Why does a recession matter to the UK public? Recessions brings slower growth from many companies, meaning fewer pay rises and the potential for job losses as businesses struggle. While the jobs market is still pretty tight, many of those effects could still be felt despite dodging a technical recession.” 8.04am GMT Reeves: Britain’s economy is stuck in the slow lane Britain’s economy is stuck in the slow lane and working people are paying the price, says Labour’s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves. She explains: “Today’s figures show us how – despite Britain’s great potential – our economy is stuck in the slow lane,” she said. “We can be a leader in the industries of the future that will help grow our economy.” “And we must bring in urgent measures to prevent yet more harm from the cost-of-living crisis, using a proper windfall tax on oil and gas giants to stop the energy price cap going up in April so that people have more money in their pockets.” GDP figures show growth at 0.0%. Despite Britain’s great potential, our economy is stuck in the slow lane and working people are paying the price. The government must get a grip of the cost of living crisis and urgently bring forward a proper plan for growth. — Rachel Reeves (@RachelReevesMP) February 10, 2023 Updated at 8.45am GMT 8.01am GMT RSM: UK still faces recession in 2023 The worst is yet to come for the UK economy, with consumer spending is likely to falter this year as the squeeze on household real incomes intensifies, one economist warns. Thomas Pugh, economist at audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK, predicts that UK GDP will contract in the first half of this year – meaning a recession this year. And while it may be milder than the Bank of England feared a few months ago, that would encourage the central bank to raise interest rates again soon to 4.25%, he predicts. Pugh says: ‘The UK has avoided falling into recession by the skin of its teeth, but the worst is yet to come. There are clear signs that the economy has deteriorated over the last few months, GDP fell by 0.5% in December after growing by 0.1% in November. The combination of double-digit inflation, the huge rises in interest rates over the last year and less fiscal support means households real disposable incomes are set to shrink sharply in the first half of this year. That will lead to falling consumer spending and a shrinking economy. As a result, we think the recession has just been delayed rather than cancelled. ‘Of course, narrowly avoiding a recession doesn’t change much on the ground. For businesses operating in the real economy a rise in GDP of 0.1% doesn’t feel much different to a drop in GDP of 0.1%. But a milder recession would mean that unemployment rises more slowly, wage growth stays strong and domestically generated inflation falls at a slower pace than expected. This could result in the Bank of England (BoE) raising rates by more than expected. 7.56am GMT Despite the typical seasonal boost to spending around the Christmas period, December suffered a sharp economic sharp contraction which meant that the UK economy logged zero growth during the final quarter of 2022, says Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor. December’s growth was negatively impacted by industrial action across the UK with postal strikes, a hit to public services and lower school attendance. On top of that the Premier League football’s pause for the FIFA World Cup also had a negative impact on UK GDP. Lingering double-digit inflation also continues to weigh on consumer confidence, spending and business margins. The Bank of England has recently rolled back its highly pessimistic forecasts from last year for the UK economy to face the longest recession since records began. Instead in the final quarter of 2022, it was projecting growth of 0.1%, which the official data just fell short of this morning. Although the UK managed to technically stave off a recession, the growth picture remains bleak weighed down by industrial action and sky-high inflation which is driving the cost-of-living crisis for consumers and a cost of doing business crisis too. The UK central bank is in the unenviable position of trying to raise interest rates to the extent that price pressures cool without inadvertently tipping the economy into a recession. 7.55am GMT Today’s GDP report includes some “worrying developments”, warns David Bharier, head of research at the British Chambers of Commerce. Bharier points out that output in the production sector shrank in the last quarter. He says companies were hit by high energy prices, and also face headwinds including continuing strike action and further uncertainty around Britain’s trading relationship with Europe. Production output fell by 0.2% in Q4 2022, eight of the 14 service sectors saw contractions, and monthly GDP fell by 0.5% in December. “Small businesses have seen three years of economic shocks, including lockdowns, global supply chain crises, Brexit, and soaring energy costs. “Our research has shown that most small firms have seen no improvements to sales, exports, or investment. Retailers and hospitality firms are among the worst affected as consumer confidence takes a hit. 7.42am GMT ONS: anecdotal evidence that strikes hit economy There is “anecdotal evidence” to suggest that industrial action had an impact across a wide range of industries in December, the Office for National Statistics says. In its December GDP report, the ONS says there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that rail strikes had negatively impacted some businesses. Most comments were received from restaurants, caterers, hotels and bars, but other affected units included those engaged in the manufacture of jewellery, the wholesale of food, beauty treatments and the wholesale of wine. Units involved in car hire and in land transport reported an increase in turnover because of the rail strikes. There was also anecdotal evidence that postal strikes had negatively impacted some businesses, the statistics body explains: The units affected included businesses engaged in financial planning, hospitality, computer repair, and management consulting. Other units affected include those involved in the manufacture of metal doors and windows, blankets and jewellery and the wholesale of flowers, watches, garden furniture, computer equipment, optical equipment, motor vehicle parts, and households’ goods. Royal Mail staff began a series of days of strike action in early December, in a dispute over pay and conditions. Updated at 7.48am GMT 7.36am GMT UK escapes recession \"by the skin of its teeth\" The UK has escaped recession by the skin of its teeth, says Jeremy Batstone-Carr, European Strategist at Raymond James Investment Services. Batstone-Carr points out that the cost of living crisis will continue to hit households this year: Today’s figures confirm that the UK has escaped recession by the skin of its teeth in 2022. With December’s contraction of 0.5%, skirting recession by the slimmest of margins, the UK has achieved a minor economic victory. November’s 0.1% growth came as a significant surprise, with England’s footballers providing sufficient cheer to temporarily offset the negative effects of elevated inflation and rising rates. But the footballers have now packed up and come back home, bringing an end to this economic reprieve. We are still in for the downturn which so far has been barely kept at bay. It will be shorter and shallower than previously thought, as per the Bank of England’s forecasts. The lagged impact of earlier base rate increases combined with additional policy tightening will ensure it happens. However, whether we are officially in recession will not make much difference to most people – it will simply feel like a continuation of the present sluggishness and cost-of-living woes. 7.33am GMT Full story: UK narrowly avoids recession after figures show growth flatlining The UK narrowly avoided entering a recession at the end of last year, official figures reveal, after economic growth was flat in the final three months of 2022, my colleague Phillip Inman reports. However, the economy did contract in December, as feared – by 0.5% - following a growth figure of 0.1% in November and 0.55% in October. Negative growth in the fourth quarter would have signalled recession, after the economy shrank by 0.3% in the third quarter, according to the figures from the Office for National Statistics. A technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. With the cost of living crisis eating into household spending power and many small businesses struggling to stay afloat, few economists expected a strong performance in the run-up to the festive season. Here’s the full story: Related: UK narrowly avoids recession after figures show growth flatlining 7.30am GMT Jeremy Hunt says economy is more resilient than feared Chancellor Jeremy Hunt says has warned that the UK economy is not out of the woods, after narrowly swerving a recession in the last quarter. Hunt says the economy is showing more resilience than expected, pointing out that the UK’s 4% growth during 2022 is faster than other advaned economies. He says: “The fact the UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 last year, as well as avoiding a recession, shows our economy is more resilient than many feared. “However, we are not out the woods yet, particularly when it comes to inflation.” UK GDP report Photograph: ONS Updated at 8.21am GMT 7.19am GMT UK shrank 0.5% in December alone Britain’s service sector had a rough December. Services sector GDP shrank by 0.8% in December alone, today’s flurry of GDP data shows, which helped to drag the wider economy down by 0.5% in December. Strikes and the postponement in Premier League football both hit the economy in December. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), says: “The economy contracted sharply in December meaning, overall, there was no growth in the economy over the last three months of 2022. “In December public services were hit by fewer operations and GP visits, partly due to the impact of strikes, as well as notably lower school attendance. Meanwhile, the break in Premier League football for the World Cup and postal strikes also caused a slowdown. “However, these falls were partially offset by a strong month for lawyers, growth in car sales and the cold snap increasing energy generation. “Across 2022 as a whole, the economy grew 4%, Morgan adds: Despite recent squeezes in household incomes, restaurants, bars and travel agents had a strong year. “Meanwhile, health and education also began to recover from the effects of the pandemic.” 7.13am GMT On a quarterly basis, the UK economy was still 0.8% below its pre-coronavirus level, today’s GDP report shows. That makes the UK the only G7 country that hasn’t recovered all the lost output due to Covid-19, Bloomberg points out: BREAKING: New GDP data reveals the UK economy was 0.8% smaller at the end of 2022 than its size at the end of 2019 That makes the UK the only G-7 country that has yet to fully recover output lost during the pandemic https://t.co/5zn9RTEwjQ pic.twitter.com/cUfJblh3u1 — Bloomberg UK (@BloombergUK) February 10, 2023 Updated at 7.37am GMT 7.08am GMT For 2022 at a whole, UK GDP increased by an estimated 4.0%, following a 7.6% increase in 2021, the Office for National Statistics says. 7.03am GMT ONS: UK avoids falling into recession Newsflash: The UK has avoided falling into recession at the end of last year. The Office for National Statistics reports that UK GDP was flat in the last quarter of 2022, as economists had expected. That follows a 0.2% contraction (revised up from -0.3%) recorded in the third quarter of last year, meaning Britain has avoided the technical definition of a recession – two consecutive quarters of contraction in a row. But, the economy did contract in December, as feared, by 0.5%. The ONS says: The first quarterly estimate of UK real gross domestic product (GDP) shows there was no growth in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2022. Monthly estimates published today show that GDP fell by 0.5% in December 2022, following an unrevised growth of 0.1% in November 2022. In output terms, the services sector slowed to flat output on the quarter driven by falls in the education, and transport and storage sub-sectors. Elsewhere, growth of 0.3% in construction was offset by a 0.2% fall in the production sector in Quarter 4 2022. Updated at 12.23pm GMT 6.46am GMT Any relief if the UK has avoided recession at the end of last year will be short-lived, fears Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Europe. Cole predicts the economy will shrink in the current quarter: The monthly GDP outturns for October and November and December mean that the UK economy likely avoided a recession in calendar year 2022, if only just. Relief is likely to be short lived, however. The January PMI surveys suggested that activity weakened at the beginning of Q1 2023 and we currently see GDP contracting by 0.3% q/q. 6.42am GMT How GDP measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile Today’s GDP reportwill give a closely watched healthcheck on the UK economy. It will estimate how much (if any) economic growth was achieved, based on the value of all the goods and services that were produced, during the last quarter of 2022 and also just in December. Gross domestic product is an imperfect measure, though, some economists say. It fails to capture concepts such as well-being, or to distinguish between harmful activities and beneficial ones. Related: GDP is not a good measure of wellbeing – it’s too materialistic | Joseph Stiglitz In 1968, Robert Kennedy gave a famous rebuttal of GDP, saying it measures everything “except that which makes life worthwhile.” Kennedy explained, in an excellent, witty speech to the University of Kansas during his presidential run, that: It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman’s rifle and Speck’s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. Here’s a clip of the speech, given three months before Kennedy’s assassination: 6.34am GMT Sunak and Hunt to meet business leaders for talks on boosting economy Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt will host some of the UK’s most prominent industry leaders today as part of a drive to drum up fresh investment to revive the UK’s struggling economy.

The head of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, the outgoing Legal & General CEO Sir Nigel Wilson and Liv Garfield, the Severn Trent CEO are also expected to attend. The government said the event would build on the success of the inaugural Global Investment Summit in October 2021, which brought together more than 170 chief executives “to showcase the UK’s commitment to green investment ahead of Cop26”. More here: Related: Sunak and Hunt to host 200 UK industry leaders to drum up investment 6.32am GMT Deutsche Bank’s chief UK economist, Sanjay Raja, has predicted that the UK economy flatlined in the last quarter of 2022. If he’s right (and we find out at 7am), then a technical recession will have been avoided. But, Raja fears the UK is still in the middle of a downturn. He told clients this week: December GDP, we think, will shrink by 0.4% m-o-m, driven by broad-based weakness across construction, manufacturing and services sectors. Why the steeper fall in December? Weather disruptions and labour disputes will likely push GDP a bit lower. Still very subdued sentiment will also continue to keep demand fairly weak to end the year. If our forecasts are broadly on the mark, 2022 GDP growth will land at 4.1%, with the UK registering its third-fastest expansion since 2000. Where to now? While the UK may have just about avoided a technical recession in Q4-22, the UK is still very much in the middle of a downturn. We also continue to think that a 2023 technical recession is very likely, with GDP contracting in both Q1 and Q2. Peak-to-trough, we see GDP down around 0.5%, before registering some modest growth in H2-23. Overall, we see UK GDP shrinking by 0.5% this year and growing 0.8% next year. 6.31am GMT The UK economy surprised us a month ago with modest growth (+0.1%) in November, as pubs and bars enjoyed a boost from the men’s World Cup. The football could have helped the economy grow in December too, says analyst Michael Hewson of CMC Markets this morning: Tour operators and reservation services were positive contributors to November GDP with gains of 3.7% as people booked holidays for next year. Working on the rather unscientific basis that the World Cup ended on 18th December, and England went out on the 10th there is the prospect that we might have avoided a Q4 contraction and thus avoided the “R” word, even when taking into account the disruptive nature of the strike action which disrupted peoples travel and shopping plans. Will the UK avoid falling into a technical recession? https://t.co/md4vZ9K9yD @CMCMarkets — Michael Hewson \uD83C\uDDEC\uD83C\uDDE7 (@mhewson_CMC) February 10, 2023 6.25am GMT Introduction: UK GDP report to show if UK avoided recession. Good morning. Today we discover if Britain avoided falling into recession at the end of last year. The Office for National Statistics will release its first estimate of UK GDP for December, and for the final quarter of 2022, at 7am this morning. If the economy shrank in October-December, then the UK will be in a technical recession – defined as two quarters of contraction in a row. UK GDP has already shrunk in the July-September quarter, by 0.3%, so a second quarterly fall in activity would mean a recession. But… experts predict that the economy probably stagnated in Q4, with no growth, as the UK was hit by soaring inflation, the energy price squeeze, and strikes on the railways, within the health services, and beyond. If GDP is flat, then the recession will have been dodged – for now anyway. Samuel Tombs at City firm Pantheon Economics said he thinks that GDP hit 0.0% growth in the last three months of 2022. In a research note this week, Tombs explained: “Heavy snow in mid-December appears to have hit retail sales and construction output. In addition, the hospitality sector struggled during December’s rail strikes. “Meanwhile, surveys suggest that manufacturing output continued to fall.” We already know that the UK economy grew in October and November, as activity picked up from September when there was a bank holiday for Queen Elizabeth’s funeral. For December alone, the UK economy is forecast to have contracted by 0.3%, following 0.1% growth in November which raised hopes a recession could be avoided in 2022. Interactive Whatever happened at the end of 2022, it’s clear that 2023 will be tough – with some forecasters predicting the UK economy will contract this year. However, earlier this week, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said it expects the UK to avoid a protracted recession this year. But, high inflation means it will still “feel like a recession” at least for seven million of the poorest households, NIESR said.

The chief executive of the Grattan Institute, Danielle Wood, said she would be “sad” if “we lost the moment” for a substantial discussion about tax changes and hoped a broader debate was still possible before the next budget in May. Richard Denniss, of the Australia Institute, said leaders should not “blindly stick to promises that are unpopular, unnecessary and unfunded”. Related:The stage-three tax cuts: what are they, how do they work, and why do they exist? But there are growing expectations that the government will leave the stage-three tax cuts unchanged in the 25 October budget, despite a week of debate led by the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, about the need to make difficult decisions to suit the economic times. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, reiterated on Sunday that the government’s position had not changed – meaning it had not shifted from its pre-election pledge to keep the tax cuts. “Our position hasn’t changed, so it’s very clear,” Albanese told reporters in Perth. He noted that the tax cuts were only due to come into effect in July 2024. “We are producing a budget in October 2022,” he said, arguing that the public was not particularly engaged in the current debate. The stage-three cuts, introduced by the Morrison government and passed with Labor’s support, create a 30% flat tax rate for any income between $45,000 and $200,000. Flattening the tax scales is estimated to cost the budget $243bn over 10 years, with the benefits flowing predominantly to higher-income earners. Both Sky News and the ABC reported earlier on Sunday that the government was highly unlikely to pare back the tax cuts in the 25 October economic statement. A lack of changes in the forthcoming budget does not preclude an internal discussion about the package in the next budget, due in May. But there is heightened sensitivity within government ranks about the political risks of breaking election promises, particularly among MPs who hold marginal seats. Wood urged politicians not to be “gun-shy around tax”, saying she believed “political parties can make the case and change people’s minds”. A rethink was needed because the stage-three cuts were unaffordable in their current form, she said. The package had been devised “in a period where we were expecting to see budget surpluses for a decade”. “Instead, we’ve had a pandemic, a recession, very significant levels of government debt, and sizeable structural budget deficits as far as the eye can see,” Wood said. “Frankly, there are some pretty reasonable calls for more spending in certain areas and we haven’t had really any discussion about how we pay for it. Significantly undermining the income tax base in that world doesn’t seem to be a very smart idea.” Wood said one option would be to trim the tax cuts to leave the 37% tax bracket in place. That would reduce the size of the cut for people earning over $120,000, while leaving the tax cuts unchanged for those on $45,000 to $120,000. Another, more substantial tax reform option would be to leave stage-three cuts in place “but package them up with some reforms that address leakages to the income tax”. These leaks include superannuation tax concessions, family trusts, negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount, Wood said. “All of which are making it increasingly hard to collect tax, particularly from high income earners.” Wood said she did not mind the government putting off the issue until next year, but only if reform was still on the table. “I would be sad, though, if this was kind of the only opportunity and we lost the moment,” she said. Denniss said it was “obvious that Scott Morrison’s tax plan needs to be radically revised” but it was not obvious when the best time to make those changes. He urged the government to take “a once in a century opportunity to spend $250 billion rebuilding our economy and our society” rather than spending its political capital implementing the Coalition’s tax plan. “The sooner the government scraps the $9,000 per year tax cuts for those earning over $200,000 per year the sooner the public will take the government’s claims that there are structural problems with the budget seriously,” Denniss said. Denniss said governments should not break election commitments lightly, but nor should they blindly stick to unfunded, unpopular promises. New polling released by the Australia Institute has shown declining public support for the stage-three tax cuts. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said the issue was “not about tax cuts but whether you can trust Anthony Albanese and the Labor party”. Dutton said any decision to scrap the stage-three tax cuts would be “an unforgivable and ridiculous mistake” and said the government was still keeping changes “in their back pocket”. Related:Growing number of Australians want the stage-three tax cuts scrapped, poll shows “I want to see the prime minister honour his commitment and not lie to the Australian people,” Dutton told the ABC’s Insiders program. But some Liberals have backed the need for a rethink of the policy. They include Liberal moderate Bridget Archer, who told Guardian Australia governments have “got to have an open mind if circumstances change”. The resources minister, Madeleine King, told Sky News on Sunday the government had no plans to change the stage-three tax cuts but it was “okay to have an open discussion” about the issue.","Id":"australia-news/2022/oct/09/albanese-urged-not-to-lose-the-moment-for-tax-reform-as-he-squashes-debate-on-stage-three-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Albanese urged not to ‘lose the moment’ for tax reform as he squashes debate on stage-three cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/09/albanese-urged-not-to-lose-the-moment-for-tax-reform-as-he-squashes-debate-on-stage-three-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/09/albanese-urged-not-to-lose-the-moment-for-tax-reform-as-he-squashes-debate-on-stage-three-cuts","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":894,"webPublicationDate":"2022-10-09T06:16:07Z","hosted":false,"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/09/albanese-urged-not-to-lose-the-moment-for-tax-reform-as-he-squashes-debate-on-stage-three-cuts"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Great news for the economy! Britain is now stable enough for Matt Hancock to eat genitals on I’m a Celeb","body":"Appalling news for exotic animal genitalia, as it is revealed that former health secretary Matt Hancock will be going into the I’m a Celeb jungle. I know: it’s simultaneously the very last thing you want to see, and also ALL you want to see. To any Guardian readers prompted to email me with something along the lines of “actually I wouldn’t dream of seeing this”, do please take the following column as a thank you for your message, but also understand that it could be December before I am able to formally get back to you. I find that in November, I will mostly be watching Matt Hancock on I’m a Celebrity. The details as we have them are thus: as the ITV series launches on Sunday night, Hancock will materialise in the Australian bush, having either arrived by air or simply passed through a haunted dunny. In terms of Matt’s long but remorseless journey towards being prime minister, this is probably his equivalent of Churchill’s stint in the second Boer war. That said, he has immediately lost the Tory whip. But maybe he’ll find something much more precious – himself. Related: Matt Hancock loses Tory whip after agreeing to appear on I’m a Celebrity He will certainly take part in a series of challenges and trials with campmates including Mike Tindall, Boy George, Corrie’s Sue Cleaver, Loose Women’s Charlene White, and a load of other people who didn’t lecture you like a try-hard PSHE teacher for the whole of 2020 and half of 2021 while tens of thousands of people died needlessly on his watch. A source close to Hancock told the Guardian that the serving MP has been considering the show’s offer for a while, but only feels able to do it now because “the government is stable”. Amazing. For a while back there, it was clear things were so bad they couldn’t withstand the market-moving spectacle of Boy George mugging him off round the campfire, while Matt covered his mic and hissed: “Please, think of what this will do to gilt yields!” But now things are so bad it literally doesn’t even matter. In terms of the various tried-and-tested I’m a Celeb gameplans open to Matt, I’m trying to think of what would be the most banter outcome. Then again, it’s all banter, isn’t it? The second the genius behind the “CARE” badge got on the flight to Queensland, we already reached banter nirvana. Hang on, wait: there is one way this could go supra-banter. Specifically, Hancock could do that little introductory piece to camera all the contestants do, and keep a big reveal till the end. “Hi, I’m Matt. I’m 44, I’m an MP – quite random, I know! – and I’m here to maximise growth. Personal growth. Anything else? Oh yeah – newly single. I’m not looking for love, but … I’m not not looking for it either?” Like I say, that’s just storyboarding and not in-game footage. There is absolutely no suggestion Matt has recently parted company with former spad-u-like Gina Coladangelo, nor that he will be pictured in a clinch against the Bush Telegraph door with Love Island alumna Olivia Attwood. But look: if it does happen, I am available to go on any number of wanky news programmes and discuss “what it says about British politics”. I truly adore these studio-based think-pieces, in which no one is ever allowed to reply by simply cackling: “I mean honestly, Nick, what do you THINK it fucking says?!” Sorry, but spare us so much as a single self-styled serious news anchor attempting to use Hancock’s appearance to “provoke debate”. You know the sort of thing. “Is this actually quite clever on his part?” “In a world where people are turning off politicians, is this a way of getting them to tune back in?” Guys, please, please don’t attempt to intellectualise Matt Hancock’s turn in the jungle! Just experience it as a feeling. Let it wash over you like a really iconic I’m a Celeb waterfall shower scene. The cover of Pandemic Diaries by Matt Hancock Photograph: Twitter As for what’s brought all this on, who can say? This week has certainly seen eye-catching merchandising moves in the Matt Hancock space. Only yesterday, we got what felt like a rushed reveal of the cover of his Pandemic Diaries, which are now being published on 6 December. A little late to be formally considered a Christmas title (perhaps timed for the lucrative Dry January market). That said if you are short of a present. I think I can say with some confidence that were you to enter a local bookshop/The Works at 6.59pm on 24 December, copies of this book WILL be available, and would surely delight any family member you wish to threaten you with the bacon scissors before Christmas lunch. In fact, the book looks so insultingly dreadful that it would ironically make the perfect gift for Matt Hancock. We learn from various publicity material that Pandemic Diaries is “based on the author’s contemporaneous records of those extraordinary months”. I keep thinking of the bit in The Importance of Being Earnest where Algy asks Cecily if he can read her diary, and she goes “Oh no. You see, it is simply a very young girl’s record of her own thoughts and impressions, and consequently meant for publication.” (Although if memory serves Cecily did not produce her diary, as Hancock has done, in collaboration with Isabel Oakeshott.) Anyway, if Matt does go on to diversify into a fragrance line – and on this form you certainly wouldn’t rule it out – you could easily see it being called something like “Divorce – by Matt Hancock”. As for what to expect in his forthcoming I’m a Celeb appearance, let’s extemporise. Hancock fashioning a football out of palm fronds and badgering Jill Scott to beat him at keepy-uppies. Hancock throwing a protective ring round the camp’s elders, all of whom immediately get medevacked out. Conversations round the campfire in which Hancock tells Chris Moyles: “Ultimately what happened is that I fell in love. Is that a crime? If so, lock me up and throw away the key.” Hancock deciding Mike Tindall is a fellow alpha male and attempting to form an alliance with him: “Together, we could rule the jungle.” Tindall declining; Tindall engineering things so he faces off against Hancock in a bushtucker trial; Tindall just staring dead-eyed and unblinking at Hancock as he boshes round after round of animal dick and the former health secretary fails to keep up; Tindall’s sheer avenging willpower breaking Matt’s spirit until he succumbs to a live, category 5 spiritual meltdown and full public apology. Cop that, Scrappy Doo. The darkest potential timeline, obviously, is that the British phone-voting public takes to Matt of the Jungle, and he actually goes on to win the show. If that happens, the ban on think-pieces is obviously immediately rescinded, and I will personally join the growing numbers of people who are turning away from the very idea of democracy.

Nathaniel Chastain left his job as a product manager at OpenSea, the largest marketplace for NFTs – the unique crypto assets used to denote ownership of items such as digital art – after being accused of insider trading. On Wednesday he was arrested by the FBI in New York and charged, in a case that could prove concerning for others in crypto who assumed that practices banned in regulated markets were fair game in the wild west sector. Chastain is accused of using his insider knowledge of which tokens were going to be featured on the front page of OpenSea’s website to buy them shortly before they were featured, and sell them immediately, cashing in on the increased awareness for a small profit each time. Related: TechScape: They used my identity to flog a doomed cryptocurrency – and then things got weird US attorney Damian Williams said: “NFTs might be new, but this type of criminal scheme is not … Today’s charges demonstrate the commitment of this office to stamping out insider trading – whether it occurs on the stock market or the blockchain.” Chastain’s alleged trades had been noticed at the time. Thanks to the open nature of the NFT market, where all trades are written on to a public database called a blockchain, observers had spotted that someone was purchasing digital assets with questionable timing in September 2021. The anonymous digital wallet used for the trades was soon linked via transactions to Chastain’s own. OpenSea had not at the time issued an explicit policy against such insider trading, and acted only after Chastain’s trades came to light. In May, an apparent insider trading scheme was uncovered on a leading crypto exchange: a user who has not been identified would build up large positions in small cryptocurrencies shortly before they were listed on major exchanges, and then sell them for a profit in the resulting surge of interest. A Wall Street Journal report concluded that one such trade netted a profit of $140,000 on a $360,000 investment over less than a week. But until Chastain’s arrest this week, there was widespread debate over whether such practices were illegal, given the different norms and practices in the sector. For example the trade in so-called “shitcoins” – crypto assets created with no purpose other than to be bought and sold in a speculative market – is openly acknowledged to be full of practices that would be illegal in a regulated market. According to pseudonymous “shitcoin influencer” Epitaph, the latest wheeze to boost the value of coins is focused around “Larp tokens”. He said this referred to “tokens where the team will go to extreme lengths to convince buyers that they’re connected to famous celebrities/musicians/larger tokens. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk “It’s no secret that everything we buy is a scam on some level. The question isn’t ‘is this token a scam,’ because they all are, the question is: ‘Is this scam done well enough to convince other people to buy?’” Chastain’s arrest comes as a group of more than 25 crypto experts have written an open letter to the US Congress calling for more regulation of the sector. “We implore you to take a truly responsible approach to technological innovation and ensure that individuals in the US and elsewhere are not left vulnerable to predatory finance, fraud, and systemic economic risks in the name of technological potential which does not exist,” the group wrote. Adding to the regulatory pressure, on Thursday the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Gemini, a New York-based crypto exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, alleging the company misled regulators about the possibility of bitcoin price manipulation in a successful effort to convince the agency to allow the creation of a bitcoin futures contract. An OpenSea spokesperson said: “When we learned of Nate’s behaviour, we initiated an investigation and ultimately asked him to leave the company. His behaviour was in violation of our employee policies and in direct conflict with our core values and principles.”","Id":"technology/2022/jun/02/fbi-arrest-former-opensea-staffer-nathaniel-chastain-crypto-nfts","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webTitle":"FBI sets sights on crypto economy with arrest of former OpenSea staffer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jun/02/fbi-arrest-former-opensea-staffer-nathaniel-chastain-crypto-nfts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2022/jun/02/fbi-arrest-former-opensea-staffer-nathaniel-chastain-crypto-nfts","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":678,"webPublicationDate":"2022-06-02T17:25:49Z","hosted":false,"id":"technology/2022/jun/02/fbi-arrest-former-opensea-staffer-nathaniel-chastain-crypto-nfts"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"The Guardian view on Tory austerity: an unpopular policy returns","body":"Sir Rod Stewart is a Tory who backed Boris Johnson in 2019. So it was a surprise to hear the 78-year-old singer, when asked about recent strikes by NHS workers over pay, telling Sky News this week that he was on the nurses’ side not the Conservatives’. “I personally have been a Tory for a long time, but I think this government should stand down now and give the Labour party a go at it. Because this is heartbreaking for the nurses. In all my years of living in this country, I’ve never seen it so bad.” Polling suggests this is a widely held sentiment. The country is in a mess and everyone but ministers can see it. It is not “declinist” to say so. The government bears the bulk of the responsibility for failing to keep the trains running, the classrooms open or the emergency wards working. Public sector workers are fed up seeing their wages fall behind the cost of living. They have every right to feel aggrieved. Private sector industrial disputes are being sensibly settled – with pay awards outstripping those in the public sector. Yet the government doesn’t seem bothered about resolving industrial disputes. The running down of the public sector was a policy choice. In the decade before Covid struck, and in the name of sound money, Conservative chancellors cut annual public spending, as a proportion of GDP, from 46% to 39%. Austerity left the country underprepared when the pandemic hit. The effects of this are still being felt. Weekly deaths have reached the highest level for two years, with doctors warning that “dangerous” waits for emergency treatment are killing hundreds of people. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, didn’t want to talk about the past on Friday. A cabinet minister for a decade, he wanted to focus on the distant future, not present-day failures. Instead of explaining how ministers would work to avoid falls in real incomes and rising unemployment, Mr Hunt offered himself up as a “tech bro” ready to turn the “UK into the world’s next Silicon Valley”, with a plan “made possible by Brexit”. This is old wine in new bottles. The idea that the British economy is an entrepreneurial success story compared with sclerotic European ones has been a founding Brexiter myth that Mr Hunt’s speech married to a notion of a British genius for innovation. Mr Hunt’s plan for growth won’t work because it relies on a “restraint on spending”. For evidence just look at the warning this week from Dame Kate Bingham, the former vaccines tsar, that the UK’s hopes of becoming a science superpower are being dashed by Treasury penny-pinching over research subsidies. Yet the UK public debt ratio is lower than in many G7 countries. The government won’t spend despite the US, the EU and China using the state to build up green technology leads. Labour’s Ed Miliband is right to argue that Britain needs a proper industrial policy and a determination to put workers’ rights at the heart of it. In the next two years, £100bn is being cut from government spending – money that should be used to repair public services, and save lives and livelihoods. Britain needs a balanced economy – one that manages both unemployment and inflation – not a balanced budget. Mr Hunt, however, wants one of the key issues at the next election to be about how to close the deficit. The choice he wants Labour to face is either to slash spending like the Tories; or to raise taxes and risk Conservative attacks over redistribution; or to slow the pace of cuts, which can be framed as profligacy. But in tough times, Labour can dictate the terms of political debate – as the support from Sir Rod shows. The opposition should shape the argument to remain on the right side of it.","Id":"commentisfree/2023/jan/27/the-guardian-view-on-tory-austerity-an-unpopular-policy-returns","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Tory austerity: an unpopular policy returns | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/27/the-guardian-view-on-tory-austerity-an-unpopular-policy-returns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/27/the-guardian-view-on-tory-austerity-an-unpopular-policy-returns","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion","wordcount":637,"webPublicationDate":"2023-01-27T18:30:01Z","hosted":false,"id":"commentisfree/2023/jan/27/the-guardian-view-on-tory-austerity-an-unpopular-policy-returns"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Almost 40% of superannuation tax concessions flow to top 10% of earners, tax statement shows","body":"Superannuation tax concessions are costing the budget $50bn a year, with almost 40% of the benefit of tax breaks on earnings flowing to the top 10% of income earners. That is one of the central findings of the tax expenditures and income statement, released by the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, on Tuesday. The statement, which measures tax concessions, credits and deductions, also reveals men are receiving on average almost $1,000 more a year in super tax concessions than women. Related: Liberal MPs break ranks to back Jim Chalmers’ discussion on superannuation reform The statement was released shortly before Chalmers and prime minister Anthony Albanese announced on Tuesday that their government will move to tax superannuation balances above $3m at a higher rate as it looks for opportunities to claw back revenue. The changes will apply to around 80,000 people with balances above $3m in their accounts. Of the 10 biggest tax expenditures, which are worth more than $150bn annually, around a third is made up of superannuation tax discounts. While underscoring the case to change super tax settings, the report also confirms some of the biggest holes in the budget are caused by concessions that Labor has vowed not to change in this term, including capital gains tax. The Albanese government has decided to legislate an objective for superannuation, including that it should be “sustainable and equitable”, starting a public debate about whether it should curb tax concessions, particularly for the 1% of accounts with balances of $3m or more. On Tuesday morning, Chalmers said the statement, which includes distributional analysis by age, gender and income, would provide “greater transparency” and “help increase public awareness and inform debate about the fairness and efficiency of the tax system”. The statement shows in 2022-23 concessions on contributions to superannuation cost $23.3bn, with a further $21.5bn reduction in revenue due to concessions on the earnings of savings in super accounts. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The statement reveals that more than 55% of the benefit of superannuation tax breaks on earnings flow to the top 20% of income earners, with 39% going to the top 10% of income earners. Due to having larger super balances on average, men received 61% of the share of this concession, compared with 39% for women. Men received an average benefit of $1,100 while women got just $750. Some 46% of the benefit of the earnings concession went to those aged 60 or over, due to their higher super balances and the 0% tax rate applied to earnings in the retirement phase. The tax benefits of superannuation contributions also flowed disproportionately to high-income earners, with the top income decile – those earning more than $121,000 – receiving 30% of the benefit. Men received an average benefit of $1,950 compared to $1,390 for women. The Albanese government has rejected suggestions that curbing super tax concessions on large balances would breach its election commitment against “major” changes to the retirement savings system. After losing the 2019 election promising a broader crackdown on tax concessions including negative gearing, capital gains tax concessions and excess franking credits for those not paying tax, Labor abandoned these policies ahead of the 2022 poll. Capital gains tax concessions for a main residence cost $48bn in 2022-23 and rental deductions cost $24.4bn. In 2019-20 taxpayers reported total rental losses of $10.2bn, delivering them a $3.6bn tax benefit. Related: Treasurer asks Australians ‘whether we can afford’ tax breaks on biggest superannuation balances Other big ticket items include the $23.7bn capital gains tax concession for individuals and trusts holding assets for more than 12 months. The statement found that of the 3.1 million people claiming the benefit of $17.2bn of franking credits, 68% went to people in the top taxable income decile. More than a third (35%) of the benefit of rental deductions – which includes rental losses, interest costs, property maintenance and council rates – went to people in the top taxable income decile. The statement reveals that among the fastest-growing tax concessions is the $8bn exemption from income tax on amounts paid to National Disability Insurance Scheme recipients, which is set to grow by 19% over four years. Chalmers said “since coming to office, the Albanese government has been upfront and consistent about the challenges facing the economy and the budget”. “As well as the cost of servicing a trillion dollars of debt, Australia also faces fast-rising expenditure in areas such as health, the NDIS, aged care and defence. “We have begun the hard yards of repairing the nation’s finances.” Chalmers said the upcoming May budget would maintain a “responsible and sensible” approach. Since unveiling its proposed purpose for superannuation earlier in February, the Coalition has accused Labor of breaching its election commitment and vowed to vote against an attempt to curb tax breaks. Several independent MPs have also raised concerns. But Liberal moderates Russell Broadbent and Bridget Archer have broken ranks and endorsed a debate about super tax concessions, while crossbench senators including independent David Pocock have suggested they could support the plan.","Id":"australia-news/2023/feb/28/almost-40-of-superannuation-tax-concessions-flow-to-top-10-of-earners-tax-statement-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Almost 40% of superannuation tax concessions flow to top 10% of earners, tax statement shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/28/almost-40-of-superannuation-tax-concessions-flow-to-top-10-of-earners-tax-statement-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/feb/28/almost-40-of-superannuation-tax-concessions-flow-to-top-10-of-earners-tax-statement-shows","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":817,"webPublicationDate":"2023-02-28T02:12:54Z","hosted":false,"id":"australia-news/2023/feb/28/almost-40-of-superannuation-tax-concessions-flow-to-top-10-of-earners-tax-statement-shows"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Sunak tries to remain above fray as public sector strikes continue","body":"As teachers prepare to join the latest wave of industrial action battering Rishi Sunak’s government this week, there is little sign of either side backing down. Teachers in England and Wales will strike on Wednesday, alongside university staff, train drivers and 100,000 civil servants across scores of separate workplaces. Nurses and ambulance workers will follow next week in an unprecedented joint stoppage, raising the stakes in their long-running dispute yet higher. “People are adding it to a long list of ‘things wrong with the country’,” says James Johnson, of the pollsters JL Partners. default Sunak’s strategy appears to be to hold firm, perhaps in the hope that public support falls away, helping to squeeze striking workers into settling for minor concessions. Ministers hope they can confine these to the coming year’s pay round, after Jeremy Hunt’s March budget. No 10 has suggested any pay rise above about 3.5% would have to come with improvements to “productivity and efficiency”. But union leaders have continued to insist their members need more money now, to help them cope with double-digit inflation and start to reverse years of real-terms cuts. “Good leaders are good listeners, something that seems to be beyond this government,” says Gary Smith, general secretary of the GMB. “Ambulance workers and NHS staff have been telling ministers that our health service is in crisis because it can’t recruit and retain the people it needs. The starting point is to talk pay now.” One Labour frontbencher suggested the government might be hoping the teachers’ strikes, which kicked off in England and Wales this week and have been running in Scotland for some time, have enough impact on the public’s lives to undermine any sympathy they might have. “They’re obviously holding out for the teachers, because that tends to be the least popular of any strike. I think they are absolutely counting on that as being the tipping point,” they said, suggesting this was a misreading of the public mood. Recent polling by Ipsos put support for teachers’ strikes at 41%, with 33% opposed. Public support for the nurses’ strikes waned significantly, from 59% in November to 45% this month, as the dispute drags on. But that still outweighed the 30% of those surveyed who were against. NHS nurses in London hold banners during a strike. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters And, crucially for any hopes ministers may have of winning the PR battle, when asked whom they blamed for the strikes continuing, 57% said the government. Luke Tryl, of the thinktank More in Common, which carries out focus groups (including for the Guardian) says: “Part of the reason the government strategy of ‘stick it to the unions’ isn’t working, is that people’s approval of the government is so low, that their general inclination is not to take the government’s side on the issue.” Union insiders believe it has also helped their cause that many of the current crop of general secretaries are some distance from the stereotype of the “union baron” – not least because they are women. Christina McAnea of Unison, Pat Cullen of the Royal College of Nursing and Sharon Graham of Unite have repeatedly stressed the parlous state of public services, as well as the demands of their cash-strapped, burnt-out members. The University and College Union’s Jo Grady is a 38-year-old academic, whose specialist subject is trade unions and pension disputes. As a collective, they hardly give the impression of being shadowy union fat cats. “We all know that the last 13 years have taken the NHS to breaking point,” Graham says. ‘“We have over 130,000 unfilled vacancies and more people are leaving every day. So the strikes have huge public support because the public understands that these workers who came out in the pandemic are fighting not only for better pay but also to save the NHS from this act of national self-harm being perpetuated by the government.” Interactive Some cabinet ministers have appeared more hardline than others in recent weeks. The transport secretary, Mark Harper, has allowed the Rail Delivery Group to make a fresh offer in the long-running rail dispute, which is currently being considered by the RMT. That marked a sharp contrast to his predecessor the keenly political Grant Shapps, who declined to meet with rail unions. The health secretary, Steve Barclay, has appeared to flip-flop between an amenable “my door is open” approach, to a much more accusatory tone, warning that striking ambulance workers had “made a conscious choice to inflict harm on patients”, for example. Reports that he was preparing to offer a one-off hardship payment to unblock the talks earlier this month were quickly denied. Unison’s head of health, Sara Gorton, who has been involved in the negotiations, says: “It looked like the tide had begun to turn with some ministers finally prepared to talk about pay. But now it feels as if the government’s digging in, and strikes are set to escalate.” At the same time, the government is pressing ahead with its minimum service levels bill. Aimed at blunting future strikes, the unions see the controversial legislation as a declaration of war. Keir Starmer has said a Labour government would repeal it. I have never seen an abdication of leadership like this in all my days Some Conservative MPs, including the former party chair Jake Berry, have dared to suggest the £1,400 across-the-board offer for nursing staff is “too low” and should be increased. But Hunt has stuck carefully to the line that he cannot revisit this year’s pay deals, for fear of unleashing a fresh round of inflation. A Treasury source says: “We’ve already been clear that we’re not reopening this year’s pay process. We’re going to keep saying that, because it’s not changing. “We don’t want to do anything that risks embedding high prices into our economy for any longer than is necessary.” Kate Bell, the TUC’s deputy general secretary, argues that the Treasury’s stance makes little economic sense. “Of course we’ve had a high inflationary environment, but I think everyone is pretty aware that it’s come from external factors, not internal pay pressure,” she says. “We’re now facing a very real threat of a recession, and government’s key message seems to be, ‘We’d like to hold down the pay of public sector workers.’” She adds that private sector pay growth has been running at more than twice the rate of the public sector (7.1% in the latest official data, against 3.3% for public sector workers). A number of industrial disputes in the private sector – between the Communication Workers Union and call centre workers at BT, for example – have been settled with additional pay increases. Sunak, whose leadership has been in the spotlight over sleaze, has largely chosen to stay out of the public debate over industrial action, aside from repeatedly describing the government’s approach as “reasonable”. Graham says: “If any private sector strike was at the stage of the NHS dispute the chief executive would be in the room negotiating. Rishi Sunak is effectively the government’s chief executive and should be leading the negotiations. Instead he is posted missing. “I have never seen an abdication of leadership like this in all my days.” With more strike days planned across the NHS – including a simultaneous stoppage by nurses and ambulance workers next week – it seems unlikely Sunak will be able to remain above the fray for much longer.","Id":"uk-news/2023/jan/31/sunak-tries-to-remain-above-fray-as-public-sector-strikes-continue","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"Sunak tries to remain above fray as public sector strikes continue ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/31/sunak-tries-to-remain-above-fray-as-public-sector-strikes-continue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/jan/31/sunak-tries-to-remain-above-fray-as-public-sector-strikes-continue","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":1201,"webPublicationDate":"2023-01-31T15:00:01Z","hosted":false,"id":"uk-news/2023/jan/31/sunak-tries-to-remain-above-fray-as-public-sector-strikes-continue"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Tory leadership: Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak clash in heated BBC debate – as it happened","body":"11.01pm BST Summary of the day … The battle to become the UK’s next prime minister descended into fierce clashes as Rishi Sunak launched repeated attacks on the economic policies of the favourite Liz Truss in their first head-to-head TV debate. The two Conservative leadership hopefuls traded blows over tax cuts, China and inflation, with the former chancellor Sunak accusing the foreign secretary of seeking “a short-term sugar rush” by cutting national insurance. Truss accused her former colleague of raising taxes to their highest level for 70 years. The exchanges at the BBC debate followed a weekend of deeply personal attacks in the contest, including on-the-record criticisms singling out the former chancellor’s wealth and wardrobe, while Truss has faced claims of being economically illiterate and a former remainer.

His death on Monday was announced by the Ulster Unionist party (UUP), the party he led into a historic power-sharing arrangement between nationalists and republicans in Northern Ireland. Lord Trimble was the first person to serve in the role of first minister, and won the Nobel peace prize, along with John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP party, for their part in negotiations for the Good Friday agreement. He was UUP leader between 1995 and 2005, accepting a life peerage in the House of Lords in 2006.

Anger over the Partygate scandal has been reignited after Scotland Yard confirmed that it did not send questionnaires to Johnson before deciding against fining him for attending two Downing Street lockdown gatherings. Fines were issued to other attenders at the gatherings in 2020, including one at No 10 on 13 November, where the prime minister gave a leaving speech for his departing director of communications, Lee Cain, and another in the Cabinet Office on 17 December. [More here] Sunak has said he will stop unions “holding working people to ransom” if he becomes prime minister in response to the announcement that the Transport Salaried Staffs Association union (TSSA) will stage railway strikes on 18 and 20 August. Sunak has challenged Truss to agree to be interviewed by former GB News presenter Andrew Neil after it was confirmed that he will record an interview with Neil for broadcast on Friday. Downing Street said travel delays seen at Dover are not caused by Brexit. It said the problems were down to a combination of factors “including a shortage of French border control staff”. Experts disagree. Keir Starmer has given a speech in which he said promoting growth is now as important for Labour as redistribution, but confusion over the party’s position on the renationalisation of railways and utilities has lingered with several different briefings during the day. Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, has implicitly criticised the speech. In a series of tweets, Corbyn restated his call for the renationalisation of rail, energy, water and mail, saying Labour needed to offer a “bold alternative”. The Green party has also criticised Labour for abandoning its commitment to renationalising utilities as set out in the 2019 manifesto. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for the evening. Thank you for following our live coverage, and for all your comments this evening. The UK politics live blog will be back in the morning. Updated at 11.17pm BST 10.55pm BST One of the more curious bits of tonight’s debate was when Liz Truss was directly questioned about saying that British workers are “among the worst idlers in the world” in a book, she for the first time appeared to claim that she hadn’t written that bit. She then said Dominic Raab wrote that chapter, and pointed out that he is supporting her rival for prime minister, Rishi Sunak. This does not appear to have gone down brilliantly with Raab, who on BBC Newsnight this evening is criticising Truss for shifting her views on debt, as Lewis Goodall points out: Dominic Raab: “We all took collective responsibility on the [Britannia Unchained] book…we all agreed…the chapter on debt, why it was so damaging for the economy, intergenerational unfairness…we were right then, it’s up to Liz to explain why she’s changed her view.” #newsnight — Lewis Goodall (@lewis_goodall) July 25, 2022 10.49pm BST Truss and Sunak trade blows in acrimonious first TV debate – full report Here is the full report of tonight’s debate, from Rajeev Syal, Ben Quinn and Jessica Elgot: The two Conservative leadership hopefuls traded blows over tax cuts, China and inflation, with the former chancellor Sunak accusing the foreign secretary of seeking “a short-term sugar rush” by cutting national insurance. Truss accused her former colleague of raising taxes to their highest level for 70 years. The exchanges at the BBC debate followed a weekend of deeply personal attacks in the contest, including on-the-record criticisms singling out the former chancellor’s wealth and wardrobe, while Truss has faced claims of being economically illiterate and a former Remainer. Sunak, widely seen as having to make up crucial ground to win over the Conservative membership, who will vote from 5 August, repeatedly described his opponent’s plans on the economy as “not conservative”, interrupting her at one point to say: “You promised almost £40bn of unfunded tax cuts, £40bn more borrowing. “That is the country’s credit card. It’s our children and grandchildren … everyone here … who are going to have to pick up the tab for that.” Truss hit back over Sunak’s calls for a tougher stance on China, pointing out that the Treasury just last month was calling for closer bilateral and economic ties. Sunak accused his opponent of making pronouncements about a “golden era” between China and the UK. “I think that was almost a decade ago,” the foreign secretary snapped back. Amid reports that Boris Johnson has not yet ruled out a political comeback, despite pledging to step down next month, both candidates also ruled out a role for the current prime minister in any government they might lead. “I am sure he will have a role. I am sure he will be vocal, but he will not be part of the government,” said the foreign secretary, despite emphasising that she had been an early supporter of Johnson’s. She contrasted her continuing loyalty to him to those of others, adding that “it would have been a dereliction of duty” not to remain in her post.

His death on Monday was announced by the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the party he led into a historic power-sharing arrangement between nationalists and republicans in Northern Ireland. Lord Trimble was the first person to serve in the role of first minister, and won the Nobel peace prize, along with John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP party, for their part in negotiations for the Good Friday agreement. He was UUP leader between 1995 and 2005, accepting a life peerage in the House of Lords in 2006. Trimble had played a “crucial and courageous role” in the Good Friday agreement negotiations, said Ireland’s Taoiseach, Micheál Martin, who said all in politics at the time had “witnessed his crucial and courageous role.” Tributes from across Northern Ireland’s political divide and beyond were paid to a politician whose own political journey from hardline unionism to a risk-taking partner with his sworn enemies helped end decades of strife. Describing Trimble as “a man of courage and vision”, the UUP’s leader, Doug Beattie, said: “He chose to grasp the opportunity for peace when it presented itself and sought to end the decades of violence that blighted his beloved Northern Ireland.” “He will forever be associated with the leadership he demonstrated in the negotiations that led up to the 1998 Belfast agreement.” On the nationalist side, the Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou McDonald, said on Twitter that she was “saddened” to hear of Trimble’s death, adding: “His contribution to building the peace process in Ireland will stand as a proud and living legacy of his political life.” David Trimble (R) poses with Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams, Social Democratic Labour Party leader John Hume and US President Bill Clinton in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, in 2000.

The Truss team have been accusing Sunak of interrupting her a lot – saying he did so 22 times in the first 12 minutes. Steven Swinford, political editor at the Times has tweeted to say that a spokesperson for Truss has claimed this shows “Rishi Sunak has tonight proven he is not fit for office. His aggressive mansplaining and shouty private school behaviour is desperate, unbecoming and is a gift to Labour” A spokesman for Liz Truss claims that Rishi Sunak is not fit for office: 'Rishi Sunak has tonight proven he is not fit for office 'His aggressive mansplaining and shouty private school behaviour is desperate, unbecoming and is a gift to Labour' — Steven Swinford (@Steven_Swinford) July 25, 2022 Sunder Katwala has questioned whether there is a right hand/left hand situation going on within the Truss camp. It seems bizarre for a candidate to say on live television that they would want the rival candidate in their team & for the same candidate's campaign to declare within minutes that that candidate is \"not fit for office\". Is the candidate responsible for the campaign briefings? — Sunder Katwala (@sundersays) July 25, 2022 The Labour MP for Walthamstow, Stella Creasy makes the point that Truss during the debate said she had stayed loyal to Boris Johnson. Creasy says “As Liz Truss thinks Rishi Sunak was a mansplaining boorish public schoolboy and that makes someone unfit for office, I imagine she refused to have anything to do with Number 10 under Boris Johnson.” As Liz Truss thinks Rishi Sunak was a mansplaining boorish public schoolboy and that makes someone unfit for office, I imagine she refused to have anything to do with Number 10 under Boris Johnson. oh.....\uD83E\uDD37‍♀️ https://t.co/pPrKm4C1EU — stellacreasy (@stellacreasy) July 25, 2022 10.32pm BST Pollster Opinium was measuring the reaction to tonight’s debate among “1,000 regular voters” and according to Sky News they put the result at “Rishi Sunak is just ahead at 39%, with Liz Truss at 38%.” 10.28pm BST You can tell a little bit about what each campaign think they did well tonight judging by the clips they immediately put out. Sunak’s social media team have gone big on his family backstory, going with “I’m standing here because of the sacrifice and love of my parents” and “They worked day and night, saved and sacrificed to provide a better future for their children.” “They worked day and night, saved and sacrificed to provide a better future for their children.” Rishi Sunak tells #BBCOurNextPM how his parents are and will always be an inspiration to him. #Ready4Rishi Sign up at https://t.co/3cXn1rFhca pic.twitter.com/amzl7tWa77 — Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) July 25, 2022 The Truss team have gone for “I’m straightforward, straight-talking and honest.

Truss boasts of her record of delivery, while also saying the country needs a complete change in approach from the government she has been part of, while Sunak, who would be one of the wealthiest prime ministers in history, wants to focus on his humble beginnings. Updated at 10.30pm BST 10.08pm BST Snap verdict My tuppence? The debate was acrimonious, will make stitching back together the parliamentary Tory party in September more difficult, and almost certainly won’t move the dial in the leadership race. All polling suggests that Truss is well in front with the Conservative membership, so Sunak needs her to somehow sink her own campaign in these debates. And she did not. In fact, she said she wasn’t the slickest media performer, and got one of the few rounds of applause for saying that. Sunak has staked not raising taxes and not paying off Covid debt as moral questions about piling the burden on to future generations. Truss seemed woollier on the economics, but cites historical precedent on debt after the second world war as a reason to take it slower and expand the economy. Nobody landed a killer blow. Sunak was as assured as ever, if a bit aggressive and more likely to interrupt his opponent, but Truss avoided disaster. They both said they could work together in the future, but I can’t believe anybody, including them, believed it. Updated at 10.14pm BST 10.01pm BST They both finished with a promise that they could work together in the future in a rather awkward exchange, where Truss pointedly said she would welcome Sunak into her team (but not cabinet) and Sunak … did not. Updated at 10.14pm BST 10.00pm BST Section 9: Quick-fire round The live blogger’s nightmare. Is Brexit to blame for delays at Dover: both no Would you both ban railway strikes: yes What score would you give Boris Johnson out of 10: Truss said seven, Sunak did a thing where he gave 10/10 for Brexit and the election. I missed one. I can’t read my own handwriting. I blame the Leeds comprehensive that Truss frequently cites. Updated at 10.15pm BST 9.57pm BST Section 8: Trust in politics One thing that is good about this debate format? Fewer “worst Kraftwerk tribute band ever” jokes because there are only two of them. A bad thing? The audience are just not being invited to ask direct questions, which then makes it a bit odd for politicians to respond to them directly. Truss is going in for the fact that in 2019 we promised not to put up taxes. She says: “I might not be the slickest presenter in the business” but she keeps her promises. There is applause. Updated at 10.15pm BST 9.54pm BST Sunak, who was in government until three weeks ago as the most powerful financial minister, says he wants to be the change the country needs. Truss says this debate is about who will beat Keir Starmer at the next election. I had thought the temperature between the two of them had cooled a bit in the last 10 minutes, although Sunak just had another interrupting run at Truss. Updated at 10.16pm BST 9.51pm BST Section 7: Boris Johnson Truss says she doesn’t think the mistakes that Johnson made – which include being fined for breaking his own Covid rules and appointing Chris Pincher to a senior role – meant he deserved to lose his job and she stayed loyal to the end. Sunak says Johnson is one of the most amazing politicians he has worked with and he is proud of what they achieved in government. Updated at 10.17pm BST 9.49pm BST Section 6: The tone of the campaign There was a long section that essentially hinged around the tweet from Nadine Dorries that Liz Truss had thrifty earrings and Rishi Sunak had expensive shoes. The important thing it seemed to me was Truss was being asked if she would disown that sort of attack, and she made great play of praising Sunak’s dress sense, and playing to the crowd that they weren’t interested in this sort of thing. But crucially, she didn’t seem to answer the question, would she disown personal attacks like that. She also said she didn’t know how Dorries knew the cost of the earrings. 9.43pm BST Section 5: Climate crisis The two candidates were asked what they thought the three most important things people could do for the environment were. Sunak said his children were the experts, and cited energy efficiency, recycling, and a faith in British innovation to solve problems. Truss, who often tries to smudge her Liberal Democrat past, said she was “a teenage eco-warrior before it was fashionable.” 9.39pm BST Section 4: Ukraine Both Truss and Sunak rule out direct navy involvement in the Black Sea. Both are proud of the work in government they have done to support Ukraine. Updated at 9.43pm BST 9.37pm BST Liz Truss goes a bit further than you often hear a foreign secretary going, specifically calling out China for its support of Russia, the treatment of Uyghurs and Chinese actions in Hong Kong. Sunak touts his record of cracking down on tech companies in response to a question about what the government will do about TikTok. Updated at 9.41pm BST 9.34pm BST Section 3: China Truss and Sunak are now clashing over China. Truss says we should not make the same mistake we made with Russia. Sunak points out that Truss once said we were entering a “golden age” of relationships with China. 9.29pm BST Sunak has said that he thought he had visited Stoke more than anywhere else while he was chancellor. Truss goes back to her upbringing in Paisley and Leeds, saying that she grew up facing low expectations. Updated at 9.42pm BST 9.28pm BST Section 2: Levelling up in the 'red wall' The BBC studio audience is made of people who voted Conservative in a so-called red wall seat in 2019, and the audience wanted to know what levelling up meant for them locally, and what these two would do in the next two years. Truss says people want “urgent action” and to get “spades in the ground”. She pushes her “low tax investment zones” and reduce planning restrictions. “We can turbocharge” local businesses, she says. Updated at 9.43pm BST 9.23pm BST This is an astonishingly argumentative debate between people in the same political party. Chris Mason is mentioning a book where Truss said British workers were lazy. She has said she didn’t write that bit, it was Dominic Raab, and he is supporting Sunak. It sounded just like me saying “I never wrote the headline actually” when I am getting bodied about something on social media. Updated at 9.27pm BST 9.17pm BST Liz Truss deploys the phrase “Project Fear”, Sunak says “only one of us was on the Leave campaign”. This is incredibly tense and aggressive. The two of them were in the same cabinet, the same government, just three weeks ago. Truss says “I’m prepared to take on the orthodoxy” and then compares Sunak to Gordon Brown. Updated at 9.45pm BST 9.16pm BST “It’s not moral” to ask our children to pick up the tabs for the bills, says Sunak. It is a clear dividing line between them. “We are an outlier,” Truss says, because other leading economies are not raising taxes or rushing to pay back debt. Updated at 9.45pm BST 9.14pm BST “If we follow Rishi’s plans we are heading for a recession,” says Truss. That is the kind of thing that makes it hard to see how these two could ever work together again. Or be a loyal backbencher. “Taxes are completely different from interest rates,” says Truss, not exactly bolstering her credits as being more insightful on the economy than the former chancellor. Updated at 9.46pm BST 9.11pm BST Truss is bringing up her upbringing in Leeds – Nesrine Malik was sensational writing about the class cosplay of these two candidates. Updated at 9.46pm BST 9.10pm BST Sunak is asking whether the country should put the cost of Covid on the never-never. Truss says she will hold paying it back for three years. Sunak interrupts and says there’s nothing conservative about not paying back debt. 9.09pm BST “One of the last things I did as chancellor,” says Sunak, was helping out people with the crisis. “I’m always going to respond to support people.” He says for the long term we need better insulated homes, and more affordable answers generated at home. Presenter Sophie Raworth interrupts him, saying she specifically asked for what they would do as short-term help. The first thing Truss says is that Trimble was “a political giant”. She says people are struggling with “the worst cost of living crisis in generations”. She commits again to reversing the national insurance increase and putting a moratorium on green levies. Updated at 9.48pm BST 9.06pm BST Section 1: Cost of living crisis Chris Mason and Faisal Islam appear to be sitting in Countdown’s dictionary corner to provide meta-commentary on the debate. That’s a twist on the format. The first section is going to be on the cost of living. They go to the audience, and it is more of a comment than a question to start with. Rishi Sunak has begun by paying tribute to David Trimble. Updated at 9.49pm BST 9.04pm BST Tonight’s debate pitches the former chancellor and the current foreign secretary against each other – both of them promising a fresh start after their party has been in power for 12 years, and both of them having held one of the highest offices in the land. Updated at 9.49pm BST 9.02pm BST First TV debate between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss begins The two people vying to be the next leader of the Conservative party, and consequently crowned the new prime minister by Tory party members in September, have taken to their podiums in Stoke-on Trent. One of Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak will be in No 10 in six weeks. Updated at 9.51pm BST 8.56pm BST Taoiseach Micheál Martin says Trimble was 'courageous' as tributes widely paid Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, has been among those to pay tribute to UUP leader and former first minister of Northern Ireland, David Trimble, who has died aged 77. Martin said: He played a key role as leader of the UUP, and his was a long and distinguished career in Unionist politics and in the politics of Northern Ireland. All of us in politics at the time witnessed his crucial and courageous role in the negotiations leading to the Good Friday Agreement and his leadership in building support in his party and his community for the Agreement. Fittingly, his contribution was recognised internationally and most notably by the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to himself and John Hume ‘for their joint efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Northern Ireland’. As the first first minister of Northern Ireland he began the arduous work of bedding down the executive and delivering for the people of Northern Ireland. In his speech accepting the Nobel Prize, Trimble spoke about the ‘politicians of the possible’, a phrase which I think sums up the David Trimble we all knew, and it speaks to his achievements over many decades, often in challenging circumstances. The work of reconciliation begun in the Good Friday Agreement continues, and as new generations pick up the mantle of this work, it is fitting that we pay tribute to Lord Trimble for his central contribution in setting us on the path to peace and reconciliation.” Tributes have been paid cross-party and cross-border. The British deputy prime minister Dominic Raab has described Trimble as “a statesman of enormous courage, who made the peace process in Northern Ireland possible. He will be sorely missed, but he leaves an extraordinary legacy.” Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill tweeted: “It is with genuine regret that I have learned of the passing of former first minister, David Trimble. I wish to offer my sincere condolences to his wife Daphne, their four children and the wider family circle who will feel his loss deeply. His very significant contribution to the peace process and his courage in helping achieve the Good Friday Agreement leaves a legacy a quarter century on for which he and his family should be rightly proud.” Several people in their tributes have pointed to Trimble’s 1998 Nobel lecture, where he himself said: We have started. And we will go on. And we will go on all the better if we walk, rather than run. If we put aside fantasy and accept the flawed nature of human enterprises. Sometimes we will stumble, maybe even go back a bit. But this need not matter if in the spirit of an old Irish proverb we say to ourselves, “Tomorrow is another day”. David Trimble.

Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have spent the weekend surrounded by increasingly rancorous briefings against each other, which have included the pair appearing to outbid each other on who can be tougher against asylum seekers, tougher on China, and even who spends the most on clothes accessories. Sunak goes into the debate the clear leader among Conservative MPs to be the next prime minister, but polling puts Truss well ahead with the members who will actually decide. The result will be announced at the beginning of September. Tonight’s debate on BBC One will last an hour, and is being held in Stoke-on-Trent.

The Ulster Unionist Party, which he used to lead, said in a statement that the former first minister of Northern Ireland had “passed away peacefully earlier today following a short illness.” Downing Street has had to deny that prime minister Boris Johnson intends to cling on to power after the Telegraph published an “exclusive” in which Lord Cruddas said Johnson “does not want to resign” as prime minister and wishes he could “wipe away” his departure. Former Conservative Party chair Francis Maude has warned Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss not to trash the Conservative party brand during tonight’s televised leadership debate, which is scheduled to start at 9pm. Bloomberg has published an economic analysis saying that Truss’s plans for tax cuts could add 0.6% to GDP in 2023. But “that boost may be short-lived because it would likely prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates.” Sunak has said he will stop unions “holding working people to ransom” if he becomes prime minister in response to the announcement that the Transport Salaried Staffs Association union (TSSA) will stage railway strikes on 18 and 20 August. Sunak has challenged Truss to agree to be interviewed by former GB News presenter Andrew Neil after it was confirmed that he will record an interview with Neil for broadcast on Friday.

The former first minister and leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) has been praised by cross-party figures in the UK. Brandon Lewis, recently Northern Ireland secretary in Boris Johnson’s government, said: Incredibly sad news that David Trimble has died. A brilliant statesman and dedicated public servant, his legacy as an architect of the Good Friday Agreement will live on forever. The people of the UK owe him an immense debt of gratitude for all he achieved for our Union. Alistair Campbell, part of Tony Blair’s team in the late 1990s and early 2000s, described Trimble as someone who “could be a difficult and mercurial character but he was the right man in the right place at the right time.” Updated at 7.57pm BST 7.52pm BST David Trimble, former first minister of Northern Ireland and UUP leader dies aged 77 David Trimble, the former first minister of Northern Ireland and former leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) has died aged 77 according to a statement from the UUP. It said: It is with great sadness that the family of Lord Trimble announce that he passed away peacefully earlier today following a short illness. Trimble was the first person to serve in the role of first minister, and won the Nobel Peace Prize along with SDLP leader John Hume for his part in negotiations for the Good Friday Agreement.

Photograph: Brian Little/PA Related: David Trimble, key architect of Good Friday agreement, dies aged 77 Updated at 8.04pm BST 7.39pm BST PA Media are carrying a quote from a Downing Street spokesperson, saying that despite the Telegraph’s “exclusive” earlier [see 19.09], “the prime minister has resigned as party leader and set out his intention to stand down as prime minister when the new leader is in place.” 7.37pm BST Allies of Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been accused of “bullying” and firing “poisonous” criticism in pursuit of their leadership rivalry, as Nadine Dorries upped the ante of “blue-on-blue” attacks by mocking the former chancellor’s expensive outfits. Amid fears the Tory race was descending into “horrific nastiness”, some MPs urged the two remaining candidates to stop “knocking seven shades of shit out of each other” and pull out of the remaining head-to-head TV debates. Many of the briefings against the pair have come under the cloak of anonymity from their rival’s supporters. But Dorries, who is backing the foreign secretary, went public with criticism of Sunak’s expensive attire after his campaign emphasised his family’s humble beginnings. “Liz Truss will be travelling the country wearing her earrings which cost circa £4.50 from Claire Accessories [sic],” Dorries tweeted. “Meanwhile … Rishi visits Teeside [sic] in Prada shoes worth £450 and sported £3,500 bespoke suit as he prepared for crunch leadership vote.” In retaliation, a Sunak ally called the criticism “nonsense”, adding: “It’s a bit rich for a cabinet minister earning £140,000 to pretend they’re somehow just like everybody else.” A former minister lamented that “the prize is not worth winning if that’s how low you have to go” and said they were keeping their head down during such a “nasty, poisonous campaign”. Angela Richardson, who is supporting Sunak, also expressed her exasperation on Twitter, commenting: “FFS Nadine! Muted.” Read more of Aubrey Allegretti’s report here: ‘FFS Nadine!

Muted’: fears Truss-Sunak race is plunging into horrific nastiness 7.21pm BST Sunak criticises railway unions for new strike dates Rishi Sunak has said he will stop unions “holding working people to ransom” if he becomes prime minister. Commenting on new strike action announced today, PA Media quotes the former chancellor saying: “These irresponsible strikes will cause hardship for millions of ordinary workers across the country. Keir Starmer and the Labour Party should stand up to their union paymasters instead of joining them on the picket line.” The Transport Salaried Staffs Association union (TSSA) earlier called on Sunak’s former cabinet colleague, transport secretary Grant Shapps, to intervene in the summer’s rail pay and job security disputes, as it announced it will strike on two days during August. “The Labour Party are on the side of the strikers - the Conservatives are on the side of the strivers,” Sunak said. “As prime minister, I will stop the unions holding working people to ransom. I will do whatever it takes to make sure that unions cannot dictate how the British people go about their daily life.” The TSSA union, which represents around 17,000 workers in railways ferries, bus services, transport authorities and the travel trade, including station staff, operational, maintenance, supervisory and management staff, has said that its members “do not take strike action lightly”, but that in an inflationary cost-of-living crisis, those workers “are going into a third or fourth year of pay freezes and seeing their real take home pay decrease.” 7.09pm BST Johnson 'does not want to resign' – Lord Cruddas in Telegraph The Telegraph has just published what it describes as an “exclusive” by Christopher Hope, in which he writes that Lord Cruddas of Shoreditch has told him that outgoing prime minister Boris Johnson “does not want to resign” and said he was hoping a campaign among Conservative party members to keep him on would succeed. Hope writes: Boris Johnson has told a former treasurer campaigning to keep him in office that he “does not want to resign” as prime minister and wishes he could “wipe away” his departure. The prime minister also told Lord Cruddas of Shoreditch at Chequers over lunch on Friday that he “wants to fight the next general election as leader of the Conservative Party”, the peer said. The pair discussed Lord Cruddas’s “bring back Boris” campaign for a second vote among the party’s grassroots to confirm whether they think Johnson should have to resign. The peer said Johnson had told him he was “rooting for your campaign to succeed”. He said Johnson had told him he was “enjoying following” the peer’s petition, adding: “There was no ambiguity in Boris’s views. He definitely does not want to resign. He wants to carry on and he believes that, with the membership behind him, he can.” Read more here: Daily Telegraph – Boris Johnson tells friend: I don’t want to resign and will stay on if Tory members back me [£] 6.56pm BST The social media teams of Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have been posting videos ahead of getting ready to clip up the best bits of their performances in the debate tonight. Truss has gone for the message “I am the only person who can deliver the change we need to the economy in line with true Conservative principles” It is a message which does somewhat beg the question of which principles the Conservative party have been following in the twelve years that they have currently been in government, much of which she was part of.

Lord Maude, who was also formerly minister for the cabinet office, told the BBC’s PM programme this evening “One is obviously going to win the leadership, but if the behaviour of the teams and their language has been uncontrolled, and it has damaged the party’s standing or the way people see the party, then it could end up being a Pyrrhic victory.” He said that the increasingly fractious tone of interventions from the campaign teams over the weekend had begun to appear like “a race over who can sound more right-wing, as if that’s the only game in town.” Urging them to “remember it is generally an error to trash the brand”, he said that “people’s impressions will be formed by how they behave in this leadership election” and Sunak and Truss should “reflect and concentrate more on showing why they are the best person to be the prime minister of this country.” Updated at 7.34pm BST 6.18pm BST The Transport Salaried Staffs Association union (TSSA) has called on transport secretary Grant Shapps to intervene in the summer’s rail pay and job security disputes, as it announced it will strike on two days during August. Union members will walk out on 18 August and 20 August. The TSSA said thousands of its members – including station staff, operational, maintenance, supervisory and management staff – will take part in industrial action. Strike action will be taken in Avanti West Coast, c2c, East Midlands Railway, CrossCountry, Great Western Railway, LNER, and Southeastern. PA Media quotes Manuel Cortes, TSSA general secretary, saying: Most of our members are going into a third or fourth year of pay freezes, seeing their real take home pay decrease. For many rail workers in our union this is the first time they have been directly involved in an industrial dispute. We do not take strike action lightly, but enough is enough. The Conservative government is the clear block to a deal for rail workers. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps must either personally come to the table or empower train operators to reach a deal on pay, job security and conditions. Instead of wanting to resolve this dispute, we now see proposals for hundreds of ticket office closures and widespread job cuts across our railways. The proposed strike days are the same dates that the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) is striking against Network Rail and 14 train operators.

You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com or message me on Twitter – @MartinBelam. 5.59pm BST Bloomberg has published an economic analysis saying that Liz Truss’s plans for tax cuts could add 0.6% to GDP in 2023. But “that boost may be short-lived because it would likely prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates”, the analysis says. It suggests that under Truss’s plans interest rates would have to rise more than expected, reaching 3.25% by the middle of next year. The same analysis says that economic outlook for the UK would change little from what it is already under Rishi Sunak because, in economic terms, he is the continuity candidate. That is all from me for tonight. My colleague Martin Belam is now taking over. 5.46pm BST Rishi Sunak has had endorsements from two ministers who served in Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet (Peter Lilley and Michael Howard), as well as former Tory leader first elected to parliament when Thatcher was prime minister (William Hague), Greg Hands, a Sunak supporter, points out. Those who knew Margaret Thatcher’s economic policies the best are backing @RishiSunak. Rishi has the right priorities - tackling inflation, grow the economy and deliver more tax cuts (on top of his big cut in National Insurance this year). @Ready4Rishi #Ready4Rishi pic.twitter.com/ITYMMu3l6t — Greg Hands (@GregHands) July 25, 2022 Yesterday a report by Michael Savage in the Observer quoted three other ministers who served in Thatcher’s cabinet - Malcolm Rifkind, Chris Patten and Norman Lamont - also siding with Rishi Sunak, and describing Liz Truss’s proposed tax cuts as irresponsible. Related: Thatcher ministers turn on Liz Truss over tax cut plans In the Thatcher era, and afterwards, Lilley and Howard were seen as very much on the right of the Conservative party. It says something about how much the party has changed that Sunak, the person they are now supporting, is seen as the candidate of the party’s “left” - or at least not the candidate of the party’s right. (Only in a Tory leadership contest could Sunak be described as being on the left, and even then the label is a bit of a stretch.) Updated at 6.19pm BST 5.25pm BST The Green party has criticised Labour for abandoning its commitment to renationalising utilities as set out in the 2019 manifesto. (See 12.50pm.) Commenting on what Rachel Reeves and Keir Starmer said this morning, Adrian Ramsay, the Green party’s co-leader, said: It is depressing to see Labour abandoning their traditional support for public ownership of essential services at a time when this is so popular amongst voters. Their attempt to compete with the Tories will see ordinary people and the planet pay the cost as a result. It’s clear for all to see that the privatisation of essential services like energy, transport and water has served only to line the pockets of shareholders, rather than ensure that these services we all depend on are reliable and affordable. The Green party believes it is essential that public services are publicly owned, both in order to guarantee the level of service required to meet society’s needs and help tackle the climate crisis, and to ensure good pay and conditions of those working within them. 5.17pm BST Make UK, which represents British manufacturers, has welcomed Keir Starmer’s decision to promise a renewed focus on industrial strategy if he wins the next election. (See 10.57am.) Its chief executive, Stephen Phipson, said: Industry will welcome the focus on industrial strategy which is a concept that companies understand and have long campaigned for. Most developed economies have such a strategy which joins up wide strands of economic policy on innovation, skills, infrastructure and energy at both national and regional level. Time after time this has been shown to feed through into wider gains on productivity. 5.03pm BST Keir Starmer and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves inspecting a robot dog during a visit to the Manufacturing Technology Centre at the Liverpool Science Park today. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images 4.41pm BST In his speech this morning Keir Starmer said that because of the UK’s recent record of low growth in recent years “the average British family is £8,800 poorer than their equivalents in other advanced countries”. The post originally said £1,800, because I misheard the figure, but I’ve now corrected it. (See 10.41am.) Starmer was quoting a figure implied by this report from the Resolution Foundation thinktank. In its press release summarising the report, the RF said: Britain’s toxic combination of low growth and high inequality has left it trailing behind the comparable economies of Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the Netherlands, with disastrous consequences for low- and middle-income households ... Comparing the UK, not to the world’s most productive or equal countries, but to a group of five comparable nations – Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the Netherlands – the report illustrates the scale of Britain’s challenges, but also catch-up potential. If the UK had the average income and inequality levels of these countries, typical household incomes in Britain would be a third higher – equivalent to £8,800 per household – and those of the poorest households 40 per cent greater. 3.47pm BST Renationalising services like energy and rail would be pragmatic, says Corbyn's former policy chief Andrew Fisher, head of policy for Jeremy Corbyn when he was Labour leader, told Radio 4’s World at One that it was “very silly” for the party’s leadership to rule out renationalistation of utilities on cost grounds. Referring to Rachel Reeves’ comments in an interview this morning (see 11.33am), he said: The reason why private companies want water and rail and energy in private ownership is because they make money out of it. They’re revenue generating assets. So if you take them into public ownership, then you gain that revenue generating asset. So it actually brings in money. That seems to me a very silly thing for Rachel Reeves to have said. The energy companies are making huge profits. Fisher said that Keir Starmer said he would take a pragmatic, rather than an ideological, approach to renationalisation. (See 12.50pm.) Fisher went on: Well, there’s a very strong pragmatic case for public ownership of energy, of water, of the railways, which is why all three of those things are in public ownership throughout most of Europe. Fisher also said that Starmer’s focus on growth in the speech was potentially problematic for Labour. He explained: Clearly we’re in a point where we could dip into recession at the moment ... But by the time of the next election the economy will probably be growing again, because economies pick up after recessions, they tend to be fairly short, and then the economy revives. And the worry is that, if the Tories are delivering growth at that point, what else is Labour saying? Earlier Fisher posted this on Twitter to show the polls suggest the public is in favour of renationalising utilities.

But my colleague Lisa O’Carroll has written an explainer on the traffic delays at the port and, in response to the question, “Is Brexit to blame?” she writes: “To a large degree, yes.” Who’s right? Well, Lisa, obviously. Here’s an extract from her Q&A. Criticising the French, as [Liz Truss, the foreign secretary] did, was to deny the consequences of the hard Brexit the UK Conservative government fought for and won. The port handled almost 142,000 passengers over the weekend and each of those passports had to be manually stamped because of Brexit, taking the average time each passenger had to spend at passport control from 48 seconds to 90 seconds. Writing in the French English-language newspaper, the Local, the veteran commentator John Lichfield said “strictly speaking” the gridlock was not the fault of Brexit but “the fault of successive British governments who have failed to prepare for Brexit and failed to educate the British public on what Brexit means”. And here is her full article. Related: Kent travel chaos: is there a fix and should Brexit take the blame? | Explainer Updated at 3.39pm BST 3.05pm BST Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, has implicitly criticised the speech given this morning by his successor, Keir Starmer. In a series of tweets, Corbyn restated his call for the renationalisation of rail, energy, water and mail (Labour manifesto commitments in 2019), saying Labour needed to offer a “bold alternative”. This is a cost of living crisis where greed, profits and inequality continue to grow. There are more billionaires and more people forced into using food banks than at any other point in history. — Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) July 25, 2022 This scandal demands immediate action. The way forward has to be a radical economic alternative, including public ownership of rail, energy, water and the Royal Mail. — Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) July 25, 2022 We must recognise that most workers have seen cuts in wages over the past decade, whilst bosses take home record pay and bonuses. Now is the time for a bold alternative to the poverty, misery and desperation faced by millions of families in our communities and workplaces. — Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) July 25, 2022 3.00pm BST Labour 'is committed to public ownership of rail', says shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh, the shadow transport secretary, has said that Labour is “committed to public ownership of rail” - even though her leader, Keir Starmer, did not sound particularly keen on the policy when asked about it this morning. (See 12.50pm.) Our brilliant Mayors are leading the way, putting passengers back at the heart of our public transport system.@UKLabour is committed to public ownership of rail and putting the public back in control of our bus network to drive down prices, improve services and meet net zero. https://t.co/nUbQiJFowA — Louise Haigh (@LouHaigh) July 25, 2022 What a commitment to public ownership of rail might mean in practice is not especially clear. Under the Tories the Northern Rail and east coast mainline services have been renationalised because their private sector operators were failing. And during the pandemic, after the government agreed to take on the financial risk of rail franchises, the Office for National Statistics argued that in accounting terms (in terms of how debt is measured) the whole service had been nationalised. Updated at 3.40pm BST 2.42pm BST Starmer's economy speech shows he wants to 'adopt Tory policies wholesale', SNP claims And the SNP has accused Keir Starmer of adopting Tory policies. This is from Kirsten Oswald, the SNP’s deputy leader at Westminster. Keir Starmer’s rhetoric on the economy and growth would carry an ounce of credibility if his party were not the handmaidens of disastrous Tory policies which are harming the UK economy, hammering businesses, and making us all poorer. The reality is that while the Tory leadership candidates try and out-Thatcher Thatcher, Keir Starmer believes that Labour’s path back to power is to adopt Tory policies wholesale – regardless of the damage they are doing to the economy. On Brexit, freedom of movement, privatisation – you can no longer put a piece of paper between the two main Westminster parties. Updated at 2.48pm BST 2.39pm BST Starmer's opposition to nationalisation 'neoliberal dogma', says Momentum Momentum, the Labour group set up to support Jeremy Corbyn and his agenda when he was leader, has dismissed Keir Starmer’s comments on nationalisation this morning (see 12.50pm) as “neoliberal dogma” rather than smart politics.

Commenting on the decision to hold it in the UK instead, after the European Broadcasting Union decided it coud not safely be held in Ukraine, the spokesperson said: It’s deeply regrettable that a Ukraine-hosted Eurovision will not be possible. But we are confident the BBC and UK will pull out all the stops to make sure it is an event that celebrates and honours the country, the people and the creativity of Ukraine. The spokesperson also said that in talks with the Ukrainian president, Volodymur Zelenskiy, last week, Johnson and Zelenskiy “agreed that wherever Eurovision 2023 is held, it must celebrate the country and people of Ukraine”. 2.15pm BST Liz Truss has “no plans at the moment” to record an interview with Andrew Neil, her campaign says. (See 1.37pm.) 1.43pm BST No 10 claims delays at Dover not caused by Brexit At the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister’s spokesperson insisted that the delays at Dover seen over the weekend were not caused by Brexit. He said the problems were down to a combination of factors “including a shortage of French border control staff”. He went on: So these are not scenes that we think are necessitated by leaving the European Union. We think we have operational procedures and processes in place that do not need to see these levels of queues. Asked whether the UK would like the French to stop stamping travellers’ passports, the spokesperson said: Generally speaking we have a good relationship working with our French counterparts on these juxtaposed controls. It is for, obviously, individual governments to decide how to carry out checks at the border. Our view is that these should be done proportionately and sensibly given the good working relationships that we have. Asked whether the government thought the French approach to controls at the border was proportionate and sensible, the spokesperson replied: It’s not for me to pass judgment. We did see significant improvements over the weekend where they deployed more staff which has significantly reduced congestion, and that is welcome, and we will continue to have discussions with our French counterparts to ensure that there is sufficient planning ahead of any increase as we move into next weekend. The French government insists that Brexit is a major factor. And experts agree. Updated at 2.05pm BST 1.37pm BST Sunak challenges Truss to agree to interview with Andrew Neil, as he has done Rishi Sunak has challenged Liz Truss to agree to be interviewed by Andrew Neil, after it was confirmed that he will record an interview with Neil for broadcast on Friday. (See 1.20pm.) Just me then? \uD83D\uDE09 https://t.co/G1Kosx4GFA — Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) July 25, 2022 Neil is widely seen as the most ferocious political interviewer in British broadcasting at the moment – partly because of his combative style, but mostly because he is always remarkably well briefed, with the result that he can frequently leave his interviewees looking inept. Sunak is regarded as a better media performer than Truss, and this may help to explain why he has agreed to sit down with Neil. But his decision to accept the Neil invitation, and challenge Truss to do likewise, is also indicative of his standing as the underdog in the contest. Candidates who are well ahead in an election (as the polling suggests Truss is) are often reluctant to debate because they have little to gain and much to lose. The Truss campaign has not said yet whether or not Truss will grant Neil an interview. Updated at 1.58pm BST 1.20pm BST Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor and Tory leadership candidate, is going to record an interview with Andrew Neil for Channel 4 for broadcast on Friday. This is from ITN’s Ian Rumsey. BREAKING NEWS: Tory leadership candidate @RishiSunak to be interviewed live by @afneil on @channel4 this Friday, 29th July, at 7.30pm @ITNProductions — Ian Rumsey (@IJRumsey) July 25, 2022 Louisa Compton, head of news and current affairs and specialist factual and sport at Channel 4, said: After the success of our first audience debate we’re delighted that Rishi Sunak has confirmed he will be interviewed by Andrew Neil on Channel 4. We hope that Liz Truss also now agrees - and allows the British public to better understand what she stands for. Updated at 1.37pm BST 12.50pm BST Starmer indicates he no longer favours bringing rail companies back into public ownership When Keir Starmer was running for the Labour leadership after the 2019 general election, he issued 10 pledges which included: “Support common ownership of rail, mail, energy and water.” He has been in retreat from these every since, but his comments today probably take him a bit further down the path of burying Labour’s interest in renationalisation. At the Labour conference last year, after abandoning the commitment to renationalising energy companies, Starmer argued that his commitment to “common ownership” was different and he implied that his support for that still applied. More recently he has refused to restate his commitment to all of the leadership campaign 10 pledges - including “common ownership”, his watered down version of nationalisation. In her interview on the Today programme this morning Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, was specifically asked about the renationalisation of water, energy and rail. Rail is particularly problematic because Louise Haigh, the shadow transport secretary, told the rail union Aslef earlier this year that the party was “totally committed” to public ownership of rail. Labour claims Reeves was not categorically ruling this out. (See 11.33am.) But Starmer implied that renationalising rail companies was not an option he favoured. In the Q&A after his speech this morning, in response to the first question on this, from a journalist asking if he was still interested in common ownership, he replied: I take a pragmatic approach rather than an ideological one and agree with what Rachel Reeves said this morning. Having come through the pandemic, it’s very important that we have very, very clear priorities and that’s why we’ve set our fiscal rules already as an opposition ... And my priority, as I hope is obvious from this morning, is growth. The mission of the next Labour government will be growth. Starmer was then asked directly if taking rail companies back into public ownership was a priority. He again said that his approach was pragmatic, not ideological. He said: Whether it comes to rail or [energy], I think what some of our mayors and metro mayors are doing with public transport is the right way forward: absolutely focus on keeping the price down and making sure there’s control over where things go, particularly buses ... I think that is the difference that Labour metro mayors can make in power. Keir Starmer delivering his speech in Liverpool.

Related: Beijing urges British politicians not to ‘hype the China threat’ 11.33am BST Reeves suggests Labour would not renationalise rail, water or energy In his Q&A Keir Starmer said that he agreed with what Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said in an interview this morning about nationalisation. (See 11.05am.) That is not the most helpful answer because what Reeves said has been subject to some clarification. On the Today programme Reeves was asked if Labour was now ruling out nationalisation of water, energy companies and rail companies if it won the election. She replied: I’ve set out fiscal rules that say all day to day spending will be funded by day to day tax revenues ... Within our fiscal rules, to be spending billions of pounds on nationalising things that just doesn’t stack up against our fiscal rules. And when it was put to her that nationalisation was a commitment, she replied: They were a commitment in a manifesto that secured our worst results since 1935 ... We have scrapped the 2019 manifesto. That is not the starting point. We’re setting out distinct policies under Kier Starmer. But subsequently, as Sienna Rodgers from the House magazine reports, Labour said Reeves was not categorically ruling out rail nationalisation in her answer. (But the Labour clarification also does not make rail nationalisation sound particularly probable either, which is also what Reeves was implying.)

Are they right? Starmer starts by saying he knows what train journeys in the north of England are like. He has travelled by train in the region many, many times. He understands why people feel let down. But he wants to be “pragmatic, not ideological”, he says. He says some Labour metro mayors have been providing a good example, by focusing on prices for passengers, not ownership. That’s it. The Q&A is over. 11.05am BST Starmer is now taking questions. Q: What is your positon on nationalisation of energy and water firms? Starmer says he takes a pragmatic approach. He agrees with what Rachel Reeves said about this in an interview this morning. His priority is growth, he says. He is pragmatic, not ideological. 11.02am BST Starmer says he wants Labour to move on from its “old ideas”. He says redistribution cannot be secure if the country does not have strong growth. Without growth, people will be left in insecure jobs. That is why he is saying growth is as important, he says. (See 9.29am.) 10.59am BST Starmer says Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, is looking at how new forms of economic devolution could drive regional growth. 10.57am BST Starmer says his proposed industrial strategy council could be as influential as OBR Starmer says the government needs an industrial strategy. This government does not have one, he says. And an industrial strategy isn’t about growing the size of the state; it is about partnership with business and university. He confirms that Labour would legislate to set up a new industrial strategy council. He suggests this could shape policy like the Climate Change Committee, or the Office for Budget Responsibility. It could focus on national priorities that go beyond the political cycle, he says. Updated at 11.05am BST 10.54am BST Starmer says Labour’s approach to levelling up will be based on a practical plan, unlike the government’s. And he says he was impressed by the approach of Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, whom he met in Berlin recently. Starmer suggests Britain could learn from the way new battery factories are located in poor regions in Germany. Updated at 11.05am BST 10.51am BST Starmer promises 'no magic money tree economics' under Labour On the topic of being financially responsible, Starmer says Labour will set a target to reduce debt as an overall share of our economy. The Tories are proposing to waste more money. But Labour will offer sound finances, he says. There will be no magic money tree economics with us. 10.49am BST Starmer sets out five principles he says will form basis of Labour's approach to promoting growth Starmer says Labour’s approach to boosting growth will be based on five principles. First we will be financially responsible. Second, we will be distinctively British. Third, we will work in partnership with business. Fourth, we will re energise communities and spread economic power. And fifth, we will refocus our investment on boosting productivity. 10.45am BST Starmer also argues that growth will allow the government to pursue the net zero strategy. People claim growth and net zero are in conflict, he says. But he says he rejects that argument completely. A plan for net zero needs growth. A plan for growth needs net zero. 10.44am BST Starmer says the UK needs “growth, growth, growth”. And he says he has told the shadow cabinet that every policy they propose will be assessed by whether it is likely to promote growth. Without growth, the government cannot fund decent public services, unite the country, pay for national security or promote social mobility, he says. Updated at 11.04am BST 10.41am BST Starmer claims Tory failure to secure stronger growth has left families £8,800 worse off on average Starmer says Britain’s economy is weaker than its competitors. That is why Labour is making growth a priority. He says tonight people will hear from two other candidates to be the next PM. But he says Rishi Sunak is “the architect of the cost of living crisis”. And Liz Truss is “the latest graduate from the school of magic money tree economics”. Neither of them have the answers to the economic challenges that we face, Starmer says. Under the Tories the average British family has become £8,800 poorer than their equivalents in advanced economies, he claims. (That figure, presumably, is based on how much richer the UK would be if the economy had grown in line with international norms over the last 12 years.) He goes on: That’s not just a failure of policy. It’s a failure of philosophy and this leadership contest is not going to change that. UPDATE: Originally this post used the figure £1,800, not £8,800. That mistake was due to a mishearing. The £8,800 figure is explained here. Updated at 4.28pm BST 10.35am BST Keir Starmer's speech on Labour's plan for growth Keir Starmer is due to start his speech on Labour’s plan for growth shortly. There is a live feed here. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, is introducing him. She says families are due to be hit by a huge hike in energy bills in October. She says Labour will address this, but it will have a plan for growth too. She says she would like to be able to introduce Starmer as the next PM. But who knows how many more leaders the Tories will get through, she says. So she introduces him as the next Labour prime minister. Updated at 11.03am BST 10.30am BST Truss has been warning about threat posed by China for much longer than Sunak, says one of her key allies James Cleverly was the most senior member of the government giving interviews this morning. Cleverly is education secretary. (But only just, according to Caroline Wheeler and Harry Yorke in the Sunday Times yesterday; writing about Boris Johnson’s final reshuffle, they report: “Another former cabinet minister, who briefly took charge of the reshuffle, said “Not So” Cleverly, as he is known by rivals, was suggested as education secretary as a joke. He was later appointed.”) But this morning Cleverly was answering questions mostly in his capacity as a leading support of Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, for the Tory leadership. Here are the main points from his interview. James Cleverly said that Rishi Sunak, Truss’s rival for the Tory leadership, is only just catching up with her in terms of taking the threat posed by China seriously. As my colleagues Aubrey Allegretti and Vincent Ni report, Sunak is describing China as the biggest long-term threat to Britain. Related: Sunak to promise curbs on China as UK’s ‘biggest long-term threat’ In response, Cleverly said: [Truss has] been talking about [the influence of China] for a long time. So I’m very glad that Rishi’s now talking about the issues that Liz has been talking about for quite some time, and of course we do need to look at China’s influence, not just on the world stage but here in the UK. Cleverly said he would not say whether the government would close the Confucius institutes attached to British universities, as Sunak is proposing. He said: I’m in a position as education secretary where it would be unwise for me to make significant policy announcements in response to the positions that have been put out through a leadership campaign. He said he would like to remain education secretary if Truss became PM. He attacked Sunak’s plan to house asylum seekers on cruise ships as bad for tourism. In a briefing issued at the weekend Sunak said he wanted to stop people coming to the UK seeking asylum being housed in hotels, and his campaign said he would “deliver thousands of new beds through a range of existing and novel solutions, including the use of cruise ships”. Commenting on this, Cleverly said: I haven’t seen the practicalities of that. I do think that it would be interesting to see where those ships would be moored because typically the places where you can moor a cruise ship are holiday destinations. And I’m not completely sure that that would suit the tourist industry in our coastal towns which need I think a boost rather than what might be reputationally quite a negative thing, but I will look at that. What is interesting about this is that initially, in a briefing attacking the Sunak plan yesterday, the Truss camp criticised this on the grounds that holding migrants indefinitely on cruise ships would be “illegal under the Human Rights Act and the ECHR [European convention on human rights]”. But this argument is probably too “woke” for Conservative party members, not all of whom are big fans of the Human Rights Act, and so instead Cleverly latched onto a different objection. Cleverly said that Truss did not want to see interest rates rise to 7%. When it was put to him that Patrick Minford, the economist backing Truss’s plan for immediate tax cuts now, accepted that rates might have to rise to that sort of level in response, to contain inflation, Cleverly replied: Ultimately we want to keep interest rates modest. A big jump in interest rates will hit people who are already finding bills difficult, and that’s not what we want to see. But ultimately what we need to do is make sure that we have that economic boost. Cleverly said he would be “comfortable” to see Boris Johnson offered a post in Truss’s cabinet. But it was a decision for her, he said. In the TV debate last Sunday, Truss indicated she would not offer Johnson a job. Updated at 11.28am BST 9.52am BST This Tory leadership contest has been described as one of the nastiest ever, judged by what the various candidates have been saying about each other. Normally the snide, personal stuff is briefed to the media unattributably, from “sources”. But this morning Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary and a Liz Truss supporter, has posted a message on Twitter under her own name making a dig about Sunak’s taste for expensive clothing, and his wealth, while depicting Truss as a champion of frugality. .⁦@trussliz⁩ will be travelling the country wearing her earrings which cost circa £4.50 from Claire Accessories.

Keir Starmer will make a speech this morning arguing that a key problem facing Britain is that, for at least a decade, growth has been feeble. It is an argument that Starmer and his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have been making for some time (the trend rate of growth was higher before the financial crash, when Labour was in power, and low growth ultimately means lower living standards and less money for public services). But suddenly this territory is now rather crowded. In the Tory leadership contest Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are both promising to unleash growth, and some of Truss’s comments in particular about how dismal the government’s record has been over the last decade could be copy and pasted straight into a Starmer speech. Starmer will address that point in his speech. According to extracts released in advance, here are two of the points he will make. Starmer will dismiss the Tory leadership contest as “Thatcherite cosplay”. He will say: You will see a clear contrast between my Labour party and the Thatcherite cosplay on display tonight [in the Tory leadership debate]. The difference between a Labour party ready to take Britain forward. And a Tory party that wants to take us back into the past. Between Labour growth and Tory stagnation. That will be the choice at the next election and we are ready. And he will say that promoting growth is now as important for Labour as redistribution. He will say: The approach to growth I have set out today will challenge my party’s instincts. It pushes us to care as much about growth and productivity, as we have done about redistribution and investment in the past. Not to hark back to our old ideas in the face of new challenges. As my colleague Robert Booth reports in his preview of the speech, Starmer will also set out plans for a new industrial strategy council, established on a statutory footing to become “a permanent part of the [economic] landscape”.

For investors it is all about treading the tightrope: will there be recessions as is widely feared? Will central banks have to tighten interest rates more than expected to tame inflation? Can they navigate the “soft landing” that avoids too much pain for the broader economy? The US jobs numbers last week “blew away the fears of recession which had been sparked by the news that GDP had declined in both the first and second quarter”, said Rupert Thompson, an investment strategist at Kingswood, a wealth manager. But questions remain for the UK. There are certainly more UK rate rises ahead, he said. The question is whether bleak forecasts from the Bank of England will come true: The surprise was much more in the doom and gloom emanating from the Bank’s latest economic forecasts. It is now forecasting inflation to peak as high as 13% in October and a lengthy recession. GDP is expected to start contracting late this year and only emerge from recession in early 2024, falling a cumulative 2.2%. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is projected to rise from 3.8% to 6.3% by 2025. The hope is that this latest set of forecasts prove as wrong as its recent projections. Indeed, the Bank itself acknowledged the large uncertainties surrounding its estimates. It is also worth noting that the forecasts do not incorporate the additional fiscal support measures certain to be enacted regardless of whether Truss or Sunak becomes PM. Economists think the UK economy is already contracting, according to a poll by financial data company Bloomberg. If that is correct the Bank of England’s forecasts are already wrong, points out Danny Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee.

It looks like something of a bounceback after a steep drop at the end of last week following very strong US jobs data. The Federal Reserve could be forced into more rate hikes if the US economy is running hotter than it thought. So the US economy might be doing well, but with inflation rising that could make the Fed hike more aggressive. Reuters reported: Wall Street’s main indexes rose on Monday after last week’s blockbuster jobs data soothed some fears about an economic slowdown, but investors remained cautious as it also added to expectations of a hawkish Federal Reserve. 2.16pm BST I think we can safely say that Twitter founder Jack Dorsey has no plans to expand any of his various businesses into China. At least, you don’t tweet, “End the CCP” if you want to do so. Dorsey, who no longer has any direct involvement in Twitter, tweeted a news report by CNN that detailed Beijing’s strict lockdown rules. End the CCP https://t.co/tFuxHOGXxX — jack (@jack) August 6, 2022 Dorsey’s Block holding company, whose most prominent arm is payments company Square, does not operate in China, and the country also bans cryptocurrency trading for which Dorsey is an evangelist. That means he doesn’t have any direct interests in China. That door will likely be firmly closed now, for as long as the Chinese Communist party exists. 1.38pm BST Oil prices drop as traders eye drop in demand if economies contract An aerial view of Buckeye Pipe Line Co in Linden, New Jersey, United States. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images The oil price increases of recent months have played an important part in the woes of economies around the world: higher global energy prices have fuelled rapid inflation, which is likely going to choke consumer spending in the coming months. Crude oil futures prices have dropped by a dollar today, as investors look at the next part of the cycle: that fall in spending will likely drag down demand for oil (dragging down the prices that caused all the problems in the first place). The Brent crude contract (the North Sea benchmark) dropped by 1% on Monday, down from nearly $95 to $93.92 at the time of writing. At its lowest on Friday it hit $92.78, the cheapest since mid-February, just before Russia’s autocratic ruler Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, a move that was seen as a threat to global energy supplies. Oil prices have dropped back from levels seen above $130 per barrel shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. Photograph: Refinitiv West Texas Intermediate, the North American benchmark, dropped by 1.1% to $88 on Monday - also nearly its lowest since the invasion began. John Briggs, global head of economics and markets strategy at Natwest Markets, said the oil price declines came despite the strong US jobs data. The reason for the decline is not immediately obvious, he said, but demand concerns are likely behind it. It could be the end of summer driving season, it could be that recession and demand destruction fears remain (or the reaffirmation of the Fed’s commitment to destroy demand), I also heard some concern about lower Chinese demand. Downward moves in the oil price could be good news in the short term for central banks and governments hoping to engineer a “soft landing” - reducing inflation without a painful recession. Briggs said: The declines this week are interesting and we all know more would be very well received by the global central bank community as it may be the only realistic path to a soft landing for many economies. Updated at 1.39pm BST 12.33pm BST Hungary has accused Ryanair of consumer protection violations after it raised ticket prices to cope with a tax on what the government calls “extra profits.” Photograph: Anna Szilagyi/AP Irish airline Ryanair has responded in typically punchy fashion to Hungary’s announcement that it will fine it on consumer protection grounds, saying it will appeal any ruling against it. Hungarian justice minister Judit Varga revealed in a Facebook post on Monday that regulators had decided to fine Ryanair 300m forint (€760,000/£640,000) because of alleged breaches of a new law bringing in a special tax on businesses. Reuters reported: Nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government in May announced the special tax measure targeting “extra profits” earned by major banks, energy companies and other firms, aiming to plug budget holes created by a spending spree that helped him gain re-election in April. Hungary’s consumer protection authority found that Ryanair has “misled customers with its unfair business practice”, Varga wrote. She added: War inflation and the war economic situation mean that multinational companies making extra profits should pay their share of the costs of protection and national defense! In Hungary, the laws apply to everyone. In the future, avoiding or repairing the extraprofit separator will be punished by consumer protection investigation and fines! However, in an emailed statement to Reuters, Ryanair said: Ryanair [...] will immediately appeal any baseless fine raised by the Hungarian Consumer Protection Agency. No notice of any such fine has yet been received by Ryanair. If necessary, Ryanair will appeal this matter to the EU courts. 12.10pm BST TheWorks.co.uk PLC warned of a tough Christmas ahead as it slashed its guidance. Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA It may only be August, but already the prospect of a cost-of-living Christmas is lumbering into view, according to discount book retailer TheWorks.co.uk. Analysts are on the look out for big profit warnings as the cost-of-living crisis hits consumers, and The Works said the slump in sales is already here, with no clear end in sight. It said sales dropped because of a “challenging online performance” with a like-for-like sales decline of 28.6% during the quarter ending on 31 July, even as in-store sales edged up. But it was the outlook that spooked the market, prompting a deep sell-off: its share dropped by 23% on Monday morning. The company said: The general market outlook has deteriorated since the beginning of the calendar year, with low consumer confidence and rising inflation being significant factors. It is not clear how long these market conditions will persist, which creates a heightened degree of uncertainty about how consumers will behave, particularly in the forthcoming Christmas shopping season, The Works’ most important trading period. It also flagged “cost headwinds such as historically high freight costs, which are showing little sign of abating in the short term, as well as increases to the National Living Wage”. 11.55am BST The French utility group Veolia has agreed to sell the UK waste business of Suez to the Australian private equity group Macquarie for €2.4bn (£2bn) to resolve competition concerns. Veolia, which agreed a €13bn deal to buy its smaller French rival last year after a bitter takeover battle, has been disposing of parts of Suez in a number of international markets to clear anti-trust concerns. The deal, the last step in Veolia’s acquisition of Suez, follows objections raised by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) after the combination of the world’s two largest waste and water groups. In May, the CMA said that the merger of the two companies’ businesses in the UK risked driving up council bills by cutting the choice of rubbish treatment and collection providers.

Average output per hour worked in the UK increased by only 0.7% a year in the decade before the pandemic, down markedly from the average of previous decades - see the dotted steps down in this chart (before data went haywire during the pandemic on the right-hand side). The UK’s average rate of productivity growth (measured in annual percentage growth in output per hour) has dropped steadily in recent decades. Photograph: Refinitiv; Capital Economics While it isn’t a problem unique to the UK, Shearing points to factors including falling public investment and lower business confidence since the global financial crisis - both of which demand a focus on ways to use government spending to find ways of kick-starting productivity growth once more. He wrote: A grown-up race would involve grown-up debate around the economic policies needed for the UK to secure sustainable growth in its future. Instead, we have the unedifying spectacle of two candidates battling almost exclusively on who can deliver the biggest tax cuts and when. There has been almost no discussion about key issues such as post-Brexit trade and regulatory policy, energy and food security or long-term fiscal challenges.Most importantly, in articulating where they want to steer the UK as Tory leader and the country’s third prime minister in six years, neither Rishi Sunak nor Liz Truss has set out a plan to address the economy’s chronically low rate of productivity growth.

In total, a record £3.31bn in cash deposits and withdrawals were handled at post offices in July, £100m higher than in June, the company said. Personal cash withdrawals have been higher than the previous two years in every month of 2022. Personal cash withdrawals have increased markedly in recent months, the Post Office said. Photograph: Post Office The Post Office is keen to emphasise its own role as a provider of cash withdrawal and other banking services, but its long history nevertheless makes it a handy source of data on consumer behaviour. The company pointed to two - somewhat contradictory - factors pushing up cash usage: the need for holidaymakers planning to stay in the UK, and the need for households to turn to cash for budgeting amid the inflationary pressures that are increasing. Martin Kearsley, banking director at Post Office, said: We’re seeing more and more people increasingly reliant on cash as the tried and tested way to manage a budget. 10.20am BST UK economy likely shrank by 0.2% in second quarter - poll of economists The UK economy probably shrank between April and June, according to a poll of economists who are bracing for the cost-of-living crisis to become a broader economic downturn. The UK’s gross domestic product for the second quarter probably shrank 0.2%, according to a survey of economists published on Monday by Bloomberg News. The Office for National Statistics plans to publish its first estimate of second-quarter economic activity on Friday. It will be the first insight into the UK economy since the Bank of England last week warned of a coming recession that will last from the final three months of this year until the end of 2023. The data are likely to show that the extra holidays for the Queen’s jubilee in June slowed growth compared to last year, but economic activity is faltering as inflation surges. The Bank has forecast it will reach 13% by the end of the year. A graph showing the Bank of England's forecasts that the UK economy will enter recession later this year and stay in negative growth for most of 2023. However, the Bank’s forecasts cannot take into account one key variable: the response of the government when a new prime minister takes office (probably in just under a month). Liz Truss (the strong favourite in the Conservative leadership race) or Rishi Sunak will likely feel strong pressure to stage a major economic intervention to try to soften the effect of a recession - even if most of the economic policy debate so far seems to have revolved around cutting taxes (not much help to companies who are losing money) or cutting salaries for workers outside London. Writing in the Observer, former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown argued for immediate help for poorer households. He wrote: The reality is grim and undeniable: a financial timebomb will explode for families in October as a second round of fuel price rises in six months sends shock waves through every household and pushes millions over the edge. 9.26am BST The logo of Price Waterhouse Coopers is seen at its Berlin office. Photograph: Wolfgang Rattay/Reuters The UK’s accounting regulator has fined PwC £1.8m and reprimanded the firm and a partner for failures in its audit of FTSE 100 telecoms company BT. PwC’s fine from the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) was cut from £2.5m after it quickly admitted the failure, while Richard Hughes, the partner in charge of the BT audit, will also pay a fine of £42,000, cut from £60,000. BT found a fraud in its Italian operations in 2016, and in its 2017 financial results it was forced to make adjustments worth £513m to its previous accounts. However, the FRC said: “the respondents did not approach the audit of BT’s treatment of the debt adjustments with the necessary professional scepticism and they failed to adequately document their audit work across the entirety of the BT Italy adjustments.” The auditors’ breaches were not found to have been “intentional, dishonest, deliberate or reckless”, but the FRC said they were breaches of important standards. Claudia Mortimore, the FRC’s deputy executive counsel, said: In determining the financial impact of a major fraud detected within a business, difficult but important issues relating to appropriate accounting treatment and disclosures will need to be addressed. It is vital that these are subject to robust audit so that the users of financial statements can have confidence that the financial impact is properly and accurately stated in subsequent financial statements. The sanctions imposed in this case, where certain elements of the adjustments following a fraud were not subject to the required level of professional scepticism, underscore this message and will serve as a timely reminder to the profession. 8.59am BST Fashion retailer Joules, founded in 1989, could receive an investment from Next. Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA Shares in London-listed fashion retailer Joules have jumped by a quarter after it confirmed that it is in talks with the FTSE 100’s Next over a £15m investment. Joules describes itself as a “contemporary country living” brand (although the Press Association previously summed it up as a “posh wellies” retailer). The Guardian’s Mark Sweney reports: Joules, whose share price has slumped by almost 90% over the last year, said it was in talks with Next about raising the sum in a deal that would result in the clothing and homeware retailer taking a strategic minority investment in the company. Under the terms of the deal, Next could take a stake of about 25%, according to Sky News. Last month, Joules hired KPMG to assist with efforts to improve “profitability, cash generation and liquidity headroom”. Joules, which has about 130 stores and employs more than 1,000 people, also announced it was in talks to use Next’s online platform to run its digital operations. Next already sells Joules clothing through its own website. The deal will involve the transitioning of Joules’s existing online operation, warehouse, distribution and logistics to use Next’s services, Total Platform, to run its retail websites and back-end operations.

Photograph: Neil Hall/Reuters Japanese investor SoftBank has reported investment losses worth £18bn between April and June, as its massive bets on technology companies were hit by concerns about rising inflation and recessions. SoftBank said its Vision Funds, two investment funds backed by Saudi Arabia, suffered losses of ¥2.9 trillion (£18bn) during the quarter. The company, controlled by the billionaire Masayoshi Son, blamed the “global downward trend in share prices due to growing concerns over economic recession driven by inflation and rising interest rates”. SoftBank has been hoping to list Arm, the UK-based chip designer, on the Nasdaq stock exchange, but the conditions have proven tricky for its portfolio of startups, many of which lose money and will need to raise funds via intiail public offerings. Some of the steepest losses for its publicly listed companies were from Japanese robotics company AutoStore, US office rental business WeWork, Korean online retailer Coupang, artificial intelligence company SenseTime and food delivery company DoorDash. 8.28am BST It has been a fairly strong start to a Monday in August on the FTSE 100.

China has reported a record trade surplus thanks to strong export growth, but economists suggest the recovery from coronavirus pandemic lockdowns could be short-lived. Exports from China rose 18% year-on-year in July, well above economists’ average expectations of a 14% increase. The Chinese economy has recovered rapidly in recent months, confounding predictions of a slowdown when many of its big consumers - particularly in Europe - are already braced for a recession. Yet there has been a sugar rush from the reopening following deep lockdowns and the untangling of much of the disruption at China’s main ports, according to Julian Evans-Pritchard and Zichun Huang, economists covering the country at Capital Economics, a consultancy. That will diminish, they argued: Exports held up well last month, thanks to a backlog of orders still being cleared. But it won’t be long before shipments drop back on cooling foreign demand. Meanwhile, imports continued to trend down, pointing to further domestic weakness. Although the main constraints on exports recently have been on the supply-side, we think that cooling global demand will soon deflate China’s pandemic export boom. Chinese trade data showed a record surplus as exports boomed following reductions in pandemic restrictions and imports dipped. Photograph: Capital Economics “The momentum from the reopening rebound is fading,” wrote Craig Botham, an economist covering China at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy. We think the data suggest export growth should wane in the second half of the year, with sources of demand fading, but policy efforts to shore up manufacturing have the effect of subsidising exports, so the process is taking longer than we initially expected. Imports, meanwhile, are unlikely to impress, but should eke out continued single digit growth. The combination should exert gradual downward pressure on the trade balance in the second half. Related: China’s export sector posts stronger than expected figures for July There are also conflicting signs from the only bigger economy in the world: the US. Economists are torn as to whether it is heading for recession shortly, or whether it will take more intense tightening of monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, to tip it into a contraction. Some economists had postulated that a recession was already happening, but US jobs data on Friday suggested it is still growing fast. The data also suggest that the Fed may have to raise interest rates even more than expected in order to prevent further inflation. Stock market futures on Monday suggested that Wall Street shares could dip when trading opens, in anticipation of tighter monetary policy. “The US economy simply cannot be deemed to be in a recession in a month when +528k jobs have just been added as payrolls showed on Friday,” wrote Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank. This still feels to me like a classic (albeit compressed), old fashioned boom bust cycle. The Fed has been aggressively behind the curve with monetary policy amazingly loose versus history. The Fed have tightened a bit but monetary policy operates with a lag and monetary policy was and is still very loose. I still think recession by around the middle of 2023 is a slam dunk and that risk assets will go well below their June 2022 lows when we’re in it, but I’m still not convinced the official recession happens over the next few months. It probably won’t affect the short-term economic outlook, but there was also a big political story in the US overnight. The Democratic party has managed to scrape through a bill, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, that will allocate $369bn (£306bn) to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in renewable energy sources. The bill passed the Senate after a compromise deal agreed between Joe Manchin, a senator who held disproportionate power because of narrow majority, and will be voted on in the House of Representatives. The bill, which is also aimed at cutting healthcare costs, will allow the administration of US President Joe Biden to claim a victory ahead of mid-term elections in November. It will also set the US on track to cut emissions by about 40% below 2005 levels, compared to about 25% without the act, according to several thinktanks’ analyses.","Id":"business/live/2022/aug/08/china-trade-economy-recession-us-coronavirus-pandemic-ftse-100-sterling-federal-reserve-biden-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webTitle":"UK economy shrank in second quarter according to poll of economists – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/aug/08/china-trade-economy-recession-us-coronavirus-pandemic-ftse-100-sterling-federal-reserve-biden-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/aug/08/china-trade-economy-recession-us-coronavirus-pandemic-ftse-100-sterling-federal-reserve-biden-business-live","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":3713,"webPublicationDate":"2022-08-08T14:16:59Z","hosted":false,"id":"business/live/2022/aug/08/china-trade-economy-recession-us-coronavirus-pandemic-ftse-100-sterling-federal-reserve-biden-business-live"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"The Tory leadership debate was a masterclass in telling us what we already knew","body":"Julie Etchingham, moderating Sunday’s ITV tory leadership debate, started by labouring the format as if it was a quizshow. She would ask some questions. The candidates could ask things of one another. They could play their secret buzzer card only once. It’s a difficult time for TV professionals; you live your whole life thinking about what a viewer might find interesting and gainful, then suddenly you’re dumped with five cats in a sack, and expected to turn it into entertainment. But then, it’s a difficult time for all of us. There was a debate on Friday, of course, and some lessons were learned: Liz Truss’s people have clearly told her to stop moving her hands like a 90s clubber doing “big fish, little fish, cardboard box”. Team Rishi has begged him to stop smiling all the time and find some steel. Penny Mordaunt’s lot have said, “Change nothing, you’re perfect”, because they are frightened of her, or playing the long game to subvert and humiliate her, or maybe both. Tom Tugendhat’s advisers, unaccountably, have said, “You know how often you mention the army? Well do that again, only this time, more. If a sentence doesn’t contain the word ‘Afghanistan’, that sentence is not over.” Kemi Badenoch is now essaying the complicated double-speak of insider-outsider – she was there at all the Treasury meetings, on the frontline of government, she knows about brute reality and is all seeing, all wise, and yet at the same time, she is a completely clean break from the whole shower. When you really drill into it, this makes her the continuity candidate; she’s in favour of having cake, and eating it, as Boris Johnson was before her. None of them are quite far enough from Johnson for comfort, nor close enough to mimic his ease. They started with an exceedingly tedious debate about who knew how to fix the economy. All the statements, really, bar none, were so basic and falsifiable that they could have been filleted with a 15-second TikTok, if only there’d been any young people watching. According to Truss, low tax creates growth, and therefore not increasing corporation tax would somehow solve the cost of living crisis. Badenoch will tackle inflation, because that’s famously how inflation works, you just have to treat it like a bully and face it down. Sunak will rebuild with innovation, investment and education, and it’s frankly weird to have been chancellor for three years and not noticed that growth is a little bit more complicated than a cheap Blair impression. Tugendhat will also reduce the tax burden, and if you don’t believe him, you can ask his mates in the army how well he faces down an enemy. It matters not whether that enemy is Isis or VAT – the principle stands. Mordaunt knows from her background what it’s like if you can’t afford a bus fare, and while this was thin on macroeconomic heft, really, in the context, she was no more vapid than anyone else. Ding, ding! The round was over, and everyone was still standing. None of them were really landing any blows; it was more like a hand-flapping sitcom fight. The innovation of getting them to question each other was a good and revealing one, on paper, since it smoked out who each thought of as their threat, and where each thought they were strongest. The questions tended towards the wonky: Mordaunt wanted to know why Sunak hadn’t raised defence spending; Badenoch wanted to know why he’d lost so much to fraud during Covid; Truss wanted to know where he stood on China. It wasn’t that revelatory in the end; we knew that Mordaunt wanted to paint herself as the military’s friend, after all her naval cosplay; we knew that Badenoch wanted to underscore her attention to Treasury detail, and we knew that Truss unaccountably thought her keen grasp of international affairs – insofar as she goes abroad, for her job – proves she has grip. We could with a fair wind have predicted that they would all see Rishi as their main foe, since he still commands the greatest support on the non-Spartan wing of the party. His question to Truss backfired horribly. She’s been a Lib Dem and a remainer – and which is her greatest regret? Well, chum, she returned: her life has been a journey. They didn’t teach true conservatism at her ordinary comprehensive school, she had to figure it out for herself. Things were probably different at Winchester. He squirmed at this. It was probably the only point at which you could say one of them bested another. Tugendhat directed himself towards Mordaunt, judiciously, as they’re both vying for the clean-skin place on the ballot. He asked her when she was going to give more details about her plans. He’s so obsessed with Keir Starmer, though, that it felt as though his mind were elsewhere, his subconscious gaping open. “The poor viewers have a month of this to come,” said Mordaunt at one point. “We have to acknowledge what we’ve done to people,” said Badenoch. True enough, but honestly, these people, they’ll piss on you and tell you it’s raining. Two points of unity in the hour: none of them would have Boris Johnson in their cabinet, should he ask to serve; none of them wanted an early general election. This is the crucible of their problem: they want to keep the mandate, while wholeheartedly disowning the mandated, and on what grounds, they have no clue.","Id":"politics/2022/jul/17/tory-leadership-debate-masterclass-telling-us-what-we-knew","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"The Tory leadership debate was a masterclass in telling us what we already knew | Zoe Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/17/tory-leadership-debate-masterclass-telling-us-what-we-knew","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/17/tory-leadership-debate-masterclass-telling-us-what-we-knew","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":913,"webPublicationDate":"2022-07-17T20:42:04Z","hosted":false,"id":"politics/2022/jul/17/tory-leadership-debate-masterclass-telling-us-what-we-knew"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Danger and deja vu: what 2011 can tell us about the US debt ceiling crisis","body":"Angry at the size of the government debt, House Republicans have passed a bill that ties spending cuts to any lifting of the US’s debt limit. A tense fight is escalating, with Democrats refusing to budge and hardline Republicans digging in. Without a solution, economists and others warn, the US could be plunged into an “economic catastrophe”. You can be forgiven a sense of deja vu. This has all happened before. Only this time, it could be worse. The federal government has a legal maximum on how much debt it can accumulate –often called the debt ceiling or the debt limit. Congress has to vote to raise that limit and has done so 78 times since 1960 – often without fuss. But in recent years, the debt negotiations have become Washington’s most heated – and potentially dangerous – debate. Related: What is the US debt ceiling and what will happen if it is not raised? This year’s fight looks like the most high-risk one since 2011, when Republicans used the debt limit debate as a bargaining chip for spending cuts. It was a fight to the bitter end. One former congressman told the New York Times that the battle drew “parallels and distinctions with other tumultuous times such as the civil war”. With stock markets reeling and 72 hours left before the US would have defaulted on its debts, a disaster that threatened to wreak havoc on the economy, Republicans and Democrats finally agreed on a bill that raised the debt ceiling by $900bn and cut spending by nearly the same amount. For Republicans, particularly the new rightwing Tea Party members who refused to budge even as default loomed, it was a political win. Politics are once again deeply embedded in this year’s debt ceiling debate and many see a mirroring of the debt ceiling crisis of 2011. The House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, is caught between his party’s moderate and far-right factions. Though McCarthy rallied his party behind a House bill, Democrats are so far refusing to negotiate. The US treasury is already running on fumes. In January, the treasury started using “extraordinary measures” to avoid defaulting on US debts while the debate over raising the limit started. Some estimate that the US government’s default date – the so-called “X date” when the government officially runs out of funds to pay its bills — will arrive in late July, giving the GOP and Democrats less than three months to find a solution. The US has never defaulted on its debt. Failure to find a solution would send stock markets reeling, recipients of federal benefits might not get their monthly checks, parts of government would grind to a halt and “long-term damage” would be inflicted on the US economy, according to the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell. Fights over the US debt ceiling are common and usually resolved after a session of bloviating. Wall Street has so far ignored this scrap, betting on a repeat. But, as in 2011, all that could change as the X date approaches. This time the Tea Party Republicans have been replaced by even more hardline politicians – the Freedom Caucus – who begrudgingly signed on to McCarthy’s plan but have sworn to hold out for cost cuts no matter the price. “What will damage the economy is what we’ve seen the last two years: record spending, record inflation, record debt. We already know that’s damaging the economy,” Representative Jim Jordan, a founding member of the Freedom Caucus, told Reuters. David Kamin, a New York University law professor who served as an economic adviser to the Obama and Biden administrations, including during the 2011 crisis, said: “Congress has negotiated [the debt ceiling] over the many decades that it’s been in its current form. But what is different about this episode, and the episode in 2011, is the very credible threat from the Republican side to not raise the debt limit, to demand a large set of policy in exchange for a vote.” He added: “That then sets up a dangerous negotiation where what’s at stake is severe repercussions for the economy.” A default would be catastrophic for the US and global economy, creating instability in financial markets and interrupting government services. But, as the 2011 crisis showed, even getting close to default comes with a price. Markets plummeted and the ratings agency S&P downgraded the US’s credit rating for the first time in history, making it more expensive for the country to borrow money. The cost to borrow went up $1.3bn the next year and continued to be more expensive years later, essentially offsetting some of the negotiation’s cost-cutting measures. To some economists, that was just the short-term impact. The spending cuts ushered in years of budget tightening with long-lasting impacts. Chuck Schumer takes questions from journalists this week. Photograph: Tom Brenner/Reuters “We were still in a pretty depressed economy and in recovery from the great recession when those cuts were instituted. They just made the recovery last far longer than it should have,” said Josh Bivens, chief economist for the Economic Policy Institute, a leftwing thinktank. “Over the next six or seven years, really valuable public goods and services were not delivered because they were cut so sharply.” Government spending tends to rise after recessions but per-capita federal spending fell after the debt crisis. Bivens argues that if government spending had continued at its normal levels, the unemployment rate would have returned to its pre-recession level five or six years before 2017, when the job market finally recovered its losses. This time the Republican bill, called the “Limit, Save and Grow Act”, would increase the debt ceiling by $1.5tn in exchange for $1.47tn in cuts during the next fiscal year and a 1% spending increase cap thereafter. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would cut federal spending by $4.8tn over the next 10 years. The bill would mean cuts to things like defense, education and social services over time, though Republicans have outlined few specific cuts in the bill. House Republicans are proposing scrapping Joe Biden’s student relief program, making more stringent work requirements for government benefits, namely Medicaid, and rolling back several Inflation Reduction Act investments, particularly clean energy tax credits. The IRS would lose $71bn in funding under the new bill, a move that would lead to more lenient tax collection and ultimately cost the federal government $120bn over the next decade. Republicans have been targeting the IRS for budget cuts for over a decade, weakening the agency’s tax enforcement over corporations and the wealthy and allowing $18bn in lost government revenue, ProPublica estimated in 2018. While Republicans are using old tricks from 2011, Democrats appear to have learned some lessons from the Obama-era spat. After 2011, the Obama administration refused to negotiate over the debt ceiling. Biden and other Democratic leaders have continued the practice: the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, called the Republican bill “dead on arrival” when it got to the Senate. “President Biden will never force middle-class and working families to bear the burden of tax cuts for the wealthiest, as this bill does,” the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said in a statement on Wednesday. “Congressional Republicans must act immediately and without conditions to avoid default and ensure that the full faith and credit of the United States is not put at risk.” The question now is: what are the political costs for the Democrats and Republicans? As the crisis deepens, how long will they hold and who will fold? Despite Republicans preaching fiscal discipline, US debt actually rose by $7.8tn under the Trump administration. Spending cuts would also probably target GOP-friendly expenditures. The party has already had to make a tough compromise over ethanol tax credits, which were ultimately left untouched at the behest of “Corn Belt” Republican lawmakers. And McCarthy still lost four Republican votes, the most he can afford to lose with the Republicans’ slim House majority. He has little room to compromise even if he can get Biden to negotiate. Matt Gaetz, a Republican representative from Florida and another Freedom Caucus member, voted against McCarthy’s bill and said in a statement that it would “increase America’s debt by $16tn over the next 10 years”. “Gaslighting nearly $50tn in debt to America is something my conscious [sic] cannot abide at this time,” Gaetz said. Kamin pointed out that Republicans only focus on the debt ceiling as a leverage point when there is a Democratic president – the debt ceiling was raised three times during Trump’s presidency – showing that their objective is less about actually reducing the deficit than it is about playing politics. “The Republican party – at least elements of the Republican party – have organized themselves using this as a litmus test for adherence to their beliefs and are really focused on it as a central element of their agenda,” Kamin said. But the fight is “not fundamentally about deficits and debt”, he said. It is a fight about politics. As in 2011, the two sides are locked in a game of chicken and waiting for the opposition to cave. If neither side blinks, the impact on the economy will be felt for years to come.","Id":"business/2023/apr/30/us-debt-ceiling-congress-republicans-democrats-2011","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webTitle":"Danger and deja vu: what 2011 can tell us about the US debt ceiling crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/30/us-debt-ceiling-congress-republicans-democrats-2011","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/apr/30/us-debt-ceiling-congress-republicans-democrats-2011","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":1499,"webPublicationDate":"2023-04-30T07:00:05Z","hosted":false,"id":"business/2023/apr/30/us-debt-ceiling-congress-republicans-democrats-2011"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Humza Yousaf seems to backtrack over fight with UK government on gender recognition bill","body":"The Scottish National party leadership candidate Humza Yousaf has appeared to backtrack on his plans to take the UK government to court over Nicola Sturgeon’s self-identification plans, claiming he would need to scrutinise Scottish legal advice. The frontrunner tipped to replace Sturgeon had previously insisted he would fight the UK government in court over its blocking of the gender recognition reform bill. But in the final leadership debate, hosted by Times Radio, Yousaf appeared to temper his previous vows, insisting it would be “responsible” to follow legal advice. “Obviously, we will take legal advice in the round – you have to do that,” he said. “If you get an unequivocal answer from your lord advocate that says this cannot be won, you would do the responsible thing and not take that to court.” Related: Scotland gender recognition bill: what is a section 35 order? But keen to mark himself as the only candidate prepared to challenge the UK government, he added: “If we were independent we would not have a foreign government coming in, for example, and vetoing our legislation.” Kate Forbes, the finance secretary who is the other frontrunner in the race, backed reforming the law to make it easier for transgender people to change their gender and hoped to “find a way forward … that perhaps has a bit more respect at the heart of the dialogue”. She had previously said she would not have voted for the bill if she was not on maternity leave. But Ash Regan, the third candidate, criticised Yousaf’s remarks, claiming his attempt to challenge the UK government would fail. “I don’t think that shows us standing up to the UK government,” she said. Related: Westminster plays ‘high-stakes game’ over gender recognition bill The debate became heated as the two frontrunners clashed over whether children should be taught about gender identity in school. Yousaf said he was “comfortable” for his daughters to learn about it, but recognised some situations when parents should not be told. “During the course of the GRR [gender recognition reform] bill, one of the first conversations I had was with a young Muslim who was trans,” he said during the Times Radio debate in Edinburgh. “He told me very clearly that if his parents had known he was transitioning, reprisals would have been pretty difficult. “So of course I would want a 15-year-old who is considering transitioning to be comfortable enough to be able to talk to their parents. But that’s not the reality for every single person.” Related: Rishi Sunak ‘concerned’ about impact of Scotland’s gender recognition bill Forbes expressed her concern if parents were removed from the conversation. “I think just having a purely affirmative approach is a problem for our young people. “I have recently had a baby – at the 20-week scan they discovered the fact it was a little girl. It wasn’t assigned, it was a little girl. It’s critical that there aren’t conversations going on that don’t seek parents’ consent.” The candidates also clashed on tax, as Forbes said she was more in favour of growing the economy and getting people into more well paid jobs, but Yousaf called for a “progressive taxation” similar to that proposed by the Scottish Trades Union Congress, which he claims could raise £200m.","Id":"politics/2023/mar/21/humza-yousaf-seems-to-backtrack-over-fight-with-uk-government-on-gender-recognition-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Humza Yousaf seems to backtrack over fight with UK government on gender recognition bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/21/humza-yousaf-seems-to-backtrack-over-fight-with-uk-government-on-gender-recognition-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/mar/21/humza-yousaf-seems-to-backtrack-over-fight-with-uk-government-on-gender-recognition-bill","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":513,"webPublicationDate":"2023-03-21T23:03:22Z","hosted":false,"id":"politics/2023/mar/21/humza-yousaf-seems-to-backtrack-over-fight-with-uk-government-on-gender-recognition-bill"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Coalition should have heeded calls from Pacific to raise climate targets, Simon Birmingham says","body":"Senior Coalition frontbencher Simon Birmingham has said the former Morrison government was wrong to resist increasing Australia’s 2030 emissions reduction target. Speaking in Palau, Birmingham said it was “critical for us to listen carefully and attentively to our Pacific partners” and “act in concert with them”. The way Australia conducted its climate debate had not been “ideal for all of our relations”, he said. “Frankly, when you’re clearly on track to exceed targets, it makes sense to raise and to elevate those targets – and that probably should have occurred at an earlier stage,” Birmingham told reporters on the third leg of a bipartisan trip to the Pacific. Related: Albanese declares Coalition ‘stuck in time’ after Labor’s climate bill passes lower house The former Morrison government resisted domestic and international calls to strengthen the Abbott government-era target of a 26% to 28% cut in emissions by 2030, after the Nationals threatened to veto more ambitious action. Climate policy has remained a source of contention within the Coalition since its election loss in May. The opposition voted against the Albanese government’s bill to enshrine in law a new target of a 43% cut in emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2050. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, had rebuffed a push by moderate members of his shadow cabinet, including Birmingham, who counselled against blanket opposition to the climate legislation. On Thursday, Birmingham said Australia had record levels of investment in renewable energy, but the way the domestic political debate was conducted “hasn’t enabled us to convey that message as clearly as would have been ideal for all of our relations”. Birmingham said it was important to ensure “that the voices that we hear from the Pacific are heard, and that we say the same things at home as we say here” – building on comments he made earlier to Guardian Australia. “When you lose elections, it’s important to listen, to understand the reasons why you lost,” the opposition’s Senate leader said. “And, so of course, that’s about listening to the Australian electorate. But as shadow foreign minister it’s also about listening to all of our partners who we value in the region and globally to understand how we can most effectively shape policy to work with them as even deeper, stronger partners in the future.” Palau was the final stop for a bipartisan delegation led by the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, after visits to Vanuatu and the Federated States of Micronesia. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The president of Palau, Surangel Whipps, on Thursday repeated his previous appeals for stronger global action. “When it comes to climate change … you might as well bomb us because it’s constant, whether it’s typhoons, drought, the heat and sea level rise,” Whipps said. Wong said that was an important message for the world to hear. She said it was unfortunate that for more than a decade “my country was involved in a domestic political debate about climate along political partisan lines”. Simon Birmingham and Penny Wong in Vanuatu during the bipartisan visit. Photograph: SARAH/Office of Senator the Hon Penny Wong But Wong said Australia was now undergoing a “necessary” and “overdue” transformation of its emissions-intensive economy, which she described as “a big job for us”. She asked for understanding from Pacific countries that “we’re pushing the rudder” and it will “take a while for the boat to turn”. “We accept we have to do more and I’ve been honest about that,” Wong said. Related: Penny Wong says Vanuatu security deal will be made public unlike China-Solomons agreement Dutton has continued to campaign against elements of Labor’s climate policies, accusing the government of “wanting to close down every source of energy except renewable”.

He asked: “Doesn’t charity begin at home?” The prime minister denounced the question and told parliament Dutton had once stood under a microphone “making jokes about Pacific islands drowning”. Albanese said a serious climate policy was “the price of entry” into productive international relationships in 2022.","Id":"australia-news/2022/dec/15/morrison-government-should-have-heeded-calls-to-raise-climate-targets-simon-birmingham-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Coalition should have heeded calls from Pacific to raise climate targets, Simon Birmingham says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/15/morrison-government-should-have-heeded-calls-to-raise-climate-targets-simon-birmingham-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/dec/15/morrison-government-should-have-heeded-calls-to-raise-climate-targets-simon-birmingham-says","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":668,"webPublicationDate":"2022-12-15T04:18:27Z","hosted":false,"id":"australia-news/2022/dec/15/morrison-government-should-have-heeded-calls-to-raise-climate-targets-simon-birmingham-says"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"PM says he ‘wants to keep economy open’ – as it happened","body":"9.25am BST What we learned: Friday, 15 July We’ve made it through another week, just in time for a healthy burst of frost, blizzards and damaging winds.

Shortly after touching down in Sydney from Fiji, the PM was brought up to speed on the virus situation by chief medical officer Paul Kelly and health department secretary Brendan Murphy. After being briefed on the current numbers and the predicted cases over the winter wave – which health minister Mark Butler this week said could number in the “millions” – Albanese talked up Australia’s response to new vaccines and Covid drugs.

We know the Covid pandemic is not over and people should continue to act in accordance with the health advice. A growing number of state and territory leaders are calling for the federal government to reinstate the pandemic leave disaster payment at Monday’s national cabinet meeting. Albanese on Friday afternoon gave no indication that decision would change, but said the government “will continue to address issues based upon the health advice that we have received”. We want to keep the economy open and the key to that is limiting the health impact on Australians.

There had been talk the government might soften the cuts by adding more staff for crossbench senators. MP Zali Steggall is not impressed the cut has not yet been reversed: This fact that this staffing situation has still not been resolved two months out from the election, this is causing a great deal of stress in my office with the decision leading to the likely termination of the employment of parliamentary staff and the need to restructure the electorate office and terminate certain roles, impacting the community of Warringah. We are about to resume parliament and the government are also planning to present a hefty legislative agenda whilst independent MPs are under-resourced and a significant number of new MPs will be unable to speak on bills until they are given the opportunity to do their first speeches.

The goats will feast on the park’s weeds, creating an “optimal environment” for the lizards, and reducing the need for herbicides. White’s skinks have been occupying an area of Royal Park for more than 20 years and are one of the only surviving populations in central Melbourne. The reptiles prefer rocky habitats and complex vegetation with open areas to soak in sunlight, creating burrows to avoid predators, hibernate and reproduce. Weeds have reduced the quality of their habitat, with exotic grasses smothering their basking sites. Goats will be gradually introduced to seven fenced-off plots in the park over the coming weeks, before being removed in early spring. You go(a)tta be kidding me!

He said as predicted by epidemiologists, cases were continuing to surge as the virus mutated, resulting in greater hospitalisations. We are seeing the impact of these very large numbers right across the community but most importantly, from a health point of view, on our health workforce. The last thing you need when you have such huge numbers of cases around is for the government to pull its supports for people to do the right thing, and this pandemic payment is an example of something that helps the most vulnerable workers. Khorshid said now wasn’t the time to end mandatory isolation, which remained the advice of the chief health officer. That would probably cause an unacceptable impact on our community and in particular, on our health system. We were actually caught a little by surprise by the decisions of the government, having experienced, I guess, a number of expiry dates passing through the pandemic. What we’ve seen generally is the government have extended the measures we continue to need because the pandemic is still here and are still affected us. Now people are legally required to isolate for seven days if they’ve been infected with Covid and that means they also need the support from government to be able to do it. The decisions to really make sense to us and that’s why we were quite surprised by what happened. AMA president Omar Khorshid.

The Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, which are now dominant along the east coast of Australia, are expected to continue to cause increases in new cases, reinfections and hospital admissions – with an 83% increase in the number of Victorians in hospital with Covid-19 over the last three weeks. The rate of BA.4/BA.5 in clinical genomic surveillance and metropolitan and regional wastewater catchments continues to rise significantly. BA.4/BA.5 have become the dominant strains in clinical genomic samples, rising to 70% in the two weeks prior to 8 July. The BA.4/BA.5 sub-lineages were first identified in Victorian wastewater catchments in April and have since risen from under 5% in late May to an average of 66% across all catchments by 4 July.

He says the government “made it clear” the 43% target it brought to the last election wasn’t “plucked out of thin air”. It was a figure that we landed on because we knew that that is what we could deliver with the policies that we committed to at the last election, that the Australian public endorsed. We’ve also been clear it is not a cap, it is a floor on our ambition, it is what we know we can deliver the current policies and that’s we told our partners and our Pacific partner forum friends.

I cannot say it’s something that my office has been contacted about recently and we should say that the situation with the pandemic has evolved significantly during the course of these payments. The original isolation requirements were quite extensive both with the timeframe and number of people they applied to and since then, the situation has evolved significantly.

The United Workers Union says Monday’s action follows a similar walkout in May amid demands for a fair wage increase. NT secretary Erina Early said the industrial action would continue to escalate until the government returned to the negotiating table with a reasonable offer. Wage negotiations started in mid-2021 with workers demanding a three or more per cent annual pay rise to keep pace with cost-of-living increases. Early: Corrections continue to be at crisis levels with overcrowding, lack of staff, an inadequate budget. Correctional officers are suffering and we need to ensure they are properly remunerated for the risk they deal with on a daily basis. I urge the government to consider the long-term impacts of their four-year wage freeze. The pay freeze for more than 20,000 public servants was introduced in November 2020 in a bid to save more than $400m amid ongoing Territory government deficits and climbing debt levels. It was accepted by 57% of employees. In May this year, dozens of prison guards in both Alice Springs and Darwin walked off the job also calling for an end to the freeze and as well as protesting the alleged under-resourcing of the sector.

Between October 2021 and April this year, workers and patrons were required to show proof of double vaccination against Covid-19 to continue to participate in the Victorian economy. Eric and Tracey Wilson, who are self-representing, want the federal court to decide whether their rights were violated by the mandate. They claim the vaccinated economy was “aided by coercion”, and labelled government statements that double vaccination would lead to zero or lower hospital admissions as “pure fiction”. The whole basis of the vaccinated economy was fanciful. It is more about the economy than the wellbeing of Victorians. The Wilsons argued the mandate had violated their freedom under the Australian constitution, the Magna Carta and the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities. “The whole scheme is unconstitutional,” Wilson said. Lawyers for both levels of government rejected all of the Wilsons’ claims and argued the case should not be heard by the court.

Independent MP Sophie Scamps, an emergency department doctor and GP, called for the pandemic payment to be extended, and also suggested face mask mandates could help stem the tide of new cases. She told Guardian Australia: The pandemic support payment period should be extended so that people aren’t turning up to work sick and spreading the virus to fellow staff. We don’t want to see a repeat of the initial Omicron phase where so many businesses had to close due to staff shortages. We know that wearing a mask, particularly indoors, is highly effective at reducing Covid transmission. However, we also know that enough people are unlikely to wear masks indoors unless it is mandated. It is a simple measure that could save hundreds of lives and prevent our hospitals and front-line health workers being completely overwhelmed and burnt out.

Three-quarters of fatal incidents occur where the tracks curve, but the racing industry shows no interest in transferring racing to safer straight tracks. Eighty percent of deaths were euthanasia for leg injuries, even though leg injuries are usually treatable. This shows just how cruel the racing industry is. Away from the tracks, an emerging crisis in rehoming greyhounds is the result of the industry breeding six times more dogs than it can rehome after racing. Other welfare problems include unnecessary euthanasia, over-racing, lack of reporting and transparency, and no whole-of-life tracking.

Updated at 2.30am BST 2.14am BST NSW premier says he will push for extended pandemic leave pay at national cabinet meeting New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, says he will “absolutely” push for pandemic leave payments to be reinstated at a national cabinet meeting on Monday. Amid growing pressure on the Albanese government to reinstate the $750 payment for casual workers force to isolate due to Covid-19, Perrottet said he believed it was “unfair” for the government not to provide financial support when they were forced to miss work because of the virus. While he conceded the cost of the pandemic was placing pressure on both state and commonwealth budgets, Perrottet said rising case numbers during winter and the continued isolation rules for positive cases meant policies should be “tailored to the circumstances”. During a press conference this morning, Perrottet said: I’m very open to doing everything we can at the state level to support our people through this next phase of the pandemic. I think it is unfair, [when] the state imposes public health orders on people to restrict their liberty and their capacity to work, for the government to not provide financial support.

The B-double crashed into a barrier on the Western Ring Road and rolled into a Tullamarine embankment at about 2am on Friday, spilling 40 tonnes of fungicide onto the freeway. The driver, a 41-year-old Mernda man, was taken to hospital with minor injuries. Fire crews and the Environment Protection Authority will spend most of Friday clearing the freeway. “We are trying to do our best to manage the incident but also keep those roads open,” assistant chief fire officer Craig Brownlie told the ABC on Friday. “It’s a process of picking up the materials that have been spilt but also any of the dirt that the product may have gone into.” A hazardous fumes warning remains in place for residents in surrounding suburbs, while motorists are asked to avoid the area. Updated at 1.01am BST 12.43am BST Agriculture minister announces $14m package to combat foot-and-mouth disease threat Murray Watt has just announced a $14m funding package to help combat foot and mouth in Indonesia and stop it getting into Australia. He said this will also stop lumpy-skin disease coming into Australia. So, of that $14 million package, we are dedicating $5 million in immediate support to Indonesia, Timor-Leste, and Papua New Guinea, and that will cover a range of things - some of which I announced while I was in Indonesia yesterday. It will provide technical support to strengthen laboratory capacity, diagnostic testing and a range of other things. It will provide technical assistance to support on-ground control officers and efforts in Indonesia, and it will provide epidemiological support to model the likely spread of the disease within Indonesia and the region. He says standing side by side with Indonesia is important as they manage the outbreak. Domestically, the funding will cover: In addition to that $5 million, I’m also really pleased to announce today an additional $9 million in Australian government funding to ensure that Australia is adequately protected from, and prepared for, an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and lumpy skin disease. That $9m will provide 18 new additional biosecurity officers for Australian airports and mail centres, he said. Because while there is a lot of attention on the travelling public coming back from Indonesia, the advice that I have received is that the highest-risk way of foot-and-mouth disease coming back in our country is actually through animal products, meat products and dairy products, being brought in, whether by postage or freight or any other means. It will also provide funding for the new detector dogs – that I’ve previously announced – that will go into Cairns and Darwin airports, and that will be happening very soon. It will also pay for the appointment of a Northern Australia coordinator to manage the urgent development and delivery of effective surveillance and preparedness strategies across North Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia, he said. Updated at 12.56am BST 12.37am BST ‘We need the travelling public to take this seriously’, says Murray Watt on FMD Watt said people need to take this seriously – and that biosecurity is a shared responsibility. In addition to the federal government, that’s not enough. We need the state governments and territory governments to play their role in making sure that they’re prepared if we do see an outbreak come to Australia. And I’ve had a number of productive conversations with state and territory ministers about that. But, most importantly, we need the travelling public to take this seriously. If foot-and-mouth disease gets into our country, it will be a devastating blow for our agriculture industry, particularly our livestock industry. There have been estimates in the order of an $80 billion hit to the national economy if this disease gets in our country, so we owe it to ourselves, we owe it to our farmers, and we owe it to all Australians to take this disease seriously. Updated at 12.49am BST 12.35am BST Watt says the government is now risk profiling everyone coming from Indonesia. If any of those passengers match the risk profile, as I did in this mock trial, then those passengers are screened and go through what I went through - which is being questioned, having shoes cleaned, having luggage examined, having detector dogs -and, of course, if anyone does comeback in the country and declare that they have had contact with a farm or livestock, or have got grains or meat products or any of the usual things that you have to declare, then those passengers are screened as well. Updated at 12.48am BST 12.33am BST Murray Watt outlines new biosecurity measures to keep foot-and-mouth disease at bay Watt said: I have returned from a quick but productive visit to Indonesia over the last couple of days for some high-level talks with ministers in the Indonesian government, particularly around how Australia can help Indonesia, our close neighbours and our close friends, with their foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. He said he had just been through the biosecurity process when he got off the plane, and is confident Australia is doing everything it can to stop the outbreak reaching Australia. Just to tell you my experience, so that people have some idea of what we are now doing as a result of the outbreak, particularly getting to Bali last week. Pretty much as soon as the outbreak reached Bali, we imposed a number of new measures at Australian airports to protect our country from this outbreak coming back in. And as I say, I have experienced those measures this morning. So, when our flight landed, not only did we receive the usual biosecurity message that people receive on any inbound flight from overseas, but we were played a specific message about the risk of foot-and-mouth disease and what the travelling public can do to contain it. Watt said he then was handed a flyer about the outbreak when he got off the plane and was treated as a high-risk passenger. But what that meant is that even though I hadn’t declared anything, because I didn’t have anything to declare, because my profile had been assessed as a risk, then I was asked a series of questions about where I had been in Indonesia, where I had been on a farm, whether I had had any contact with livestock. And even though I said no, because I didn’t, my shoes were taken away and cleaned, my bag was examined, detector dogs came and sniffed me, my luggage, all those kind of things.

The government will provide free RATs to vulnerable communities by expanding its existing program to include those accessing tests through the federal government’s Concessional Access Program which is due to finish at the end of the month. Vulnerable communities include people with disability and their carers, homelessness services, social housing tenants, multicultural groups as well as children and young people in out-of-home care. The premier, Dominic Perrottet, said his government is committed to leaving no one behind through winter. We are making sure those people who need it most get the help they need to help keep themselves and the community safe through winter by stepping in and providing free rapid antigen tests. Free RATs will be on the agenda when national cabinet meets on Monday for a briefing on the latest medical advice and pandemic response. This week the federal government announced vulnerable Australians will lose access to free rapid antigen tests by the end of this month. Leaders could also challenge the PM on a decision to end pandemic leave payments. Updated at 11.51pm BST 11.22pm BST Assistant treasurer highlights states and territories’ ‘healthier budgets’ for pandemic leave Not all ministers are digging in as hard against pandemic leave. Some, such as the assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, sound more open to the idea, but want to “work with the states and territories”, ie get them to pay for more of it. Jones told ABC News Breakfast: We want to work with all the state and territory leaders to ensure that we can provide all the available support to Australian workers and businesses who are doing it tough. But we’ve got a very pressing economic reality facing us, and that is we’ve inherited a debt approaching $1.4 trillion. By this time next year, the interest payments on that debt alone is going to be costing us more than we spend on Medicare. So, we can’t keep adding to it ... So, we’ll have a respectful conversation with the territory and state leaders. We’re gonna try and solve the issues that are pressing upon Australian workers and businesses, but we’ve got some real economic realities facing us. It might seem easy to people to suggest that we just write another cheque, but every new cheque that we are writing today has to be paid for, and it’s being paid for on pressure in other areas of the Budget. Jones said Anthony Albanese will be “looking for solutions” and noted that many of the states and territories calling for pandemic leave payments to be extended “have actually got less debt and healthier balance sheets and healthier budgets – some of them are approaching a surplus, something that the commonwealth won’t be doing any time in the next couple of years”. But, look, this is not a time for argy-bargy, this is a time for cooperation, for us to get together with other state and territory leaders and find a solution. Because at the end of the day, we’re all trying to do our best by Australian workers and Australian businesses, many of whom are doing it really tough. Updated at 11.50pm BST 11.10pm BST Albanese says ‘good employers’ are providing Covid leave Anthony Albanese has again dug in against calls to extend Covid support payments to allow casual workers to self-isolate, promising to consider the issue but again highlighting the cost. Albanese told reporters in Fiji: We’ll give consideration to all of these issues. But we inherited these decisions, but we also inherited a trillion dollars of debt. And that’s something that was not our responsibility. There was enormous waste there in the budget. Had, for example, the government not given literally tens of billions of dollars to companies that were increasing their profits, there would have been more space in the budget to make the decisions that we would want to make. Albanese also tried a new argument on for size, that “a range of companies who are good employers are providing those systems [of leave]”. “The idea that no one is getting any sick leave at the moment, it’s just not the case,” he said. It’s a classic straw man – nobody has said that sick leave evaporated overnight, just that some workers don’t get it, and if they had support payments instead they could stay home and prevent the spread of covid. Albanese said: Good employers are recognising that people are continuing to work from home whilst they have Covid and are receiving, therefore, payments through that. What’s happening over a period of time, is that the economy and the way that we work is adjusting to the circumstances which are there. Good employers let you work from home with Covid. Good grief!

Safe and affordable housing is central to the security and dignity of all Australians,” Collins said ahead of the meeting. “For too long the federal government has not provided leadership on housing issues.

It is the year 6000. Humanity has abandoned its bodily form and lives on a USB stick. Sentient bipedal rats roam the earth on hoverboards. Great lava pools have replaced the oceans, and nobody knows what a tree is. Somewhere in what remains of the UK, something looks at a menu, ponders for a moment, and orders a McDonald’s cheeseburger for 99p. Or so you might have expected until yesterday, when the fast food giant announced a change to one of those prices that seemed written in stone: after 14 years, the era of the sub-£1 cheeseburger is over. The company said it had protected consumers from increased costs for as long as it could, and the price had to go up to £1.19. There will be increases to a range of other items like McFlurrys, fries, and large meals – but it’s the totemic burger that sticks in your head. Energy prices are going to be the biggest pressure for most households: only yesterday, it was forecast that bills will reach £3,850 per year by Christmas. But the way that this price change resonates, and how it compares with other increases in different parts of the economy, tells us some important things about another aspect of how the cost of living crisis is developing. For today’s newsletter, I’ve spoken with economist and author Duncan Weldon about handbags, video games, and the meaning of a 99p cheeseburger. Here are the headlines.

In depth: Inflation variation from Chanel to Asda A McDonald’s cheeseburger. Photograph: Michael Neelon(misc)/Alamy When we talk about inflation, it can sound like an uncontrollable, mysterious abstraction. In one sense, that’s true: there’s no ambassador for inflation to hold talks with, and no button to switch it off. In another very blunt way, though, it isn’t true: almost any time an item’s price goes up, that’s because somebody, somewhere, has decided to charge more for it. The McDonald’s hamburger hasn’t stayed 99p for 14 years because its recipe happened to feature the only combination of ingredients where costs haven’t changed: it’s stayed there because McDonald’s has decided it’s worth holding the price down and absorbing those costs itself. Duncan Weldon, author of a new history of the British economy, Two Hundred Years of Muddling Through, and the Value Added newsletter on Substack, said that the price change “will not have been an easy decision for them to make at all. [McDonald’s] know their customers well, and they will have had concern about the impact of moving the prices up. And you never know which are the things that are going to become the examples that get picked up by, for example, the Guardian morning email.” That’s influence for you, eh. From luxury goods to fast food, the tipping points for price hikes will come at very different stages. *** Chanel small classic handbag 2019 £3,810 Today £6,510 Well, look, this might be an area you have to make a cutback. “On any sort of luxury good, the producer has an awful lot of pricing power,” said Weldon. “All of their costs will have soared: price inflation for producers is running well ahead of consumer price inflation. Lots of firms have been taking a margin hit. But they don’t have the same issue with passing that on to the consumer.” That’s because, obviously, if you want a Chanel bag, you want a Chanel bag, and you’re unlikely to pick a Primark one instead. Then there’s the fact that, at a certain level, the price becomes a reassuring status symbol in itself (just like the fact that you’re limited to buying one a year). The demand is ‘inelastic’ – that is, people who think nothing of a £3,800 handbag are probably pretty comfortable with a £6,500 one as well. This is useful, in part, as an example of what simply isn’t possible in other parts of the economy. “If you’re selling mass market items competing with lots of others, you don’t have the luxury of simply passing all the costs on without thinking about it,” Weldon said. *** Video games Goldeneye, Nintendo 64, 1997 Around £60 Fifa 22, XBox One, 2022 £59.99 Those of us of a certain age and level of nerdery may remember £60 console titles in the 90s; despite vastly increased levels of complexity and corresponding budgets, so-called ‘AAA’ games are about the same price today. If they had risen with inflation, they’d be around £120 – so it’s a real-terms price cut of about 50%. But that era may be ending. “Until this bout of inflation, the story in advanced economies has been that the price of goods have effectively been falling, and services have become a bit more expensive,” Weldon said. “That’s a story of technological change, of outsourcing manufacturing and deeper globalisation. But with a severe supply chain crunch, that’s reversing.” As the pandemic started to bite at the end of 2020, games manufacturers in the US began what they viewed as a long overdue effort to raise the typical price from $60 to $70, while new and confusing revenue sources within games like “loot boxes” and expansion packs are pushing spending up in a way that doesn’t appear in the retail price. The pandemic is a huge factor on the demand side, too. “We saw this big shift in consumer spending patterns,” Weldon said. “Your typical consumer is spending a lot less than they’re used to on services, the pub or a haircut, and a lot more on goods. And all of that pushed prices up as well.” *** Lurpak slightly salted spreadable 500g Average UK supermarket price 2021 £3.53 Average UK supermarket price 2022 £4.87 You might have seen stories a few weeks ago about this 38% increase, according to research firm Assosia; the grabbier detail came in a social media post showing 750g tubs for £6 in Asda with security tags on. It isn’t just about butter, obviously: most staples have gone up in supermarkets, which have extremely low margins within which to absorb increases in costs. At the same time, said Weldon, it’s important to note that “Britain has had the cheapest food in western Europe for a long time. But now [retailers] are faced with a situation where you can’t squeeze the production costs any more, or your suppliers will go out of business.” You won’t ever see a press release announcing an item’s price rise at Tesco or Sainsbury’s: their prices change constantly, with “huge amounts of data on the impact and confidence about how it will affect demand.” Supermarkets will prioritise keeping certain high profile staples – like a pint of milk or a loaf of bread – as low as they possibly can. “They don’t like to put prices up for things which consumers notice,” Weldon said. *** McDonald’s cheeseburger 2008 – July 25 2022 99p July 26 2022 £1.19 “Behavioural economists think about anchoring points on prices,” said Weldon - and 99p is a very important one. “In the same way, it was the Pret 99p filter coffee until recently.” And, obviously, even when inflation was around 2%, McDonald’s was effectively cutting the price each year. In the past, that’s been worthwhile as a branding tool and loss leader to get customers through the door even if Big Tasty meals are creeping up. “They will have wanted to keep this down for as long as they could,” Weldon said. Painful though it is for the company, it has another future benefit: the next increases of a few pennies will be easier to make without putting people off. Just as there was never anything altruistic about the 99p price, there’s nothing particularly wicked about £1.19, either. “It’s important to step back, and say why is this happening?” Weldon said. “It’s happening because we had a pandemic, global supply chains are broken, war in Europe is making energy and food more expensive, and so the country is poorer. It’s not a story of greedy corporates’ decisions, or greedy workers demanding more, or stupid bankers printing too much money. It’s because real things have happened.” “The policy debate should be about how we allocate that pain best among firms, households, different people,” Weldon said. “And instead the political debate we have is how do we make it go away.” What else we’ve been reading Oliver Milman follows the Gen-Z environmental activists who’ve turned their ire to gas guzzling SUVs.

Biden pushed back on criticism that the timing of the announcement, which confirmed plans to release barrels from the reserve, was politically motivated by the looming midterms. John Fetterman, a key Democratic candidate in the US senate race in Pennsylvania, released a detailed doctor’s report that said he is fit to work and fully serve in office following a stroke in May. This was the first official medical report from Fetterman since June. At a speech at a conservative think tank, Mike Pence criticized the Republican party for straying from its values and said the party should be cautious of developing an isolationist mindset, particularly regarding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A district court judge said that emails from Donald Trump’s attorney, John Eastman – a key architect in his plan to overthrow the 2020 election – should be released to the House special committee investigating the insurrection. The judge said emails from Eastman prove Trump signed legal documents that contained information on election fraud that he knew was false. We’ll be closing the blog for today, but we will be back tomorrow with more live politics updates. 8.54pm BST Judge says Trump knowingly signed legal documents with false information A US district court judge said that Donald Trump signed legal documents that contained evidence of election fraud that he knew was false, Politico is reporting. Based on emails from Trump attorney John Eastman, “President Trump knew that the specific numbers of voter fraud were wrong but continued to tout those numbers, both in court and to the public,” wrote district court judge David Carter in an opinion. The opinion said that Eastman’s emails need to be turned over to the House select committee investigating the insurrection. Eastman refused to turn over their emails, citing attorney-client privilege. Carter wrote that while most of the emails may remain private, “the Court finds that these four documents are sufficiently related to and in furtherance of the obstruction crime”. 8.44pm BST A majority of Americans believe Donald Trump should testify over his involvement in the January 6 insurrection on the US Capitol, according to a Monmouth University poll released today. Six out of 10 Americans polled said that Trump should have to testify before the House committee investigating the attack. Unsurprisingly, Democrats and Republicans were split on whether Trump should have to testify, with 89% of Democrats saying he should and 67% of Republicans saying he shouldn’t. Most independents, 61%, said that he should have to testify, and only 34% said he should not have to appear at all. The American people: “We feel bad for the country, but this would be tremendous content.” 60% of Americans want Trump to testify before the Jan. 6 committee, according to a new Monmouth poll; 77% say it should be public if he does. https://t.co/RBXB6IMo40 pic.twitter.com/WATj0owRcO — Kevin Robillard \uD83C\uDDFA\uD83C\uDDF8 (@Robillard) October 19, 2022 It is unclear whether Trump will testify before the House committee, which concluded its public hearings which it says proves Trump’s involvement in the attack by voting to subpoena Trump. A formal subpoena will likely be issued this week. Trump’s public response so far has been a rambling letter addressed to representative Bennie Thompson, who chairs the special committee. Sources close to Trump said last week that he is considering testifying in front of the committee. The committee said they do not expect to make criminal referrals to the department of justice, though they have laid out their findings to help federal investigators. 8.28pm BST A group of four members of Joe Biden’s Covid advisory board just published an op-ed in the New York Times saying that there needs to be more work to address the pandemic. “We are deeply dismayed by what has been left undone,” the group, which includes Ezekial Emanuel, David Michaels, Rick Bright and Michael Osterholm, wrote. “There were many opportunities that would have permanently improved American health and the public health system. They have not yet been pursued.” “There is no question other health crises lie ahead. We need to assess the opportunities squandered or missed in the Covid pandemic and seize them now.” The group wrote that rapid, low-cost at-home-testing could be used to detect multiple infections at once. But there is no comprehensive reporting system for individuals to submit their at-home test results to public health agencies, “rendering a broad swath of infections across the country invisible to officials trying to slow their spread.” The writers note that much of the blame for inaction can be put on the lack of funding from Congress, but “not all [are] attributable to financial limitations”. They write that one big missed opportunity was one to enhance indoor air quality, particularly in schools. They recommend improving national indoor air quality standards, with focuses on schools, nursing homes, assisted-living facilities, jails and prisons and other high-risk settings. Better data collection, more paid sick leave, stronger vaccine outreach and better domestic production of medical supplies were also needed during the pandemic, they wrote. “The list could go on and on, including the poor response to long Covid.” Updated at 8.28pm BST 8.15pm BST In a speech at conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, Mike Pence criticized the direction of the Republican party saying, “I think we need to chart a course that doesn’t veer off too far in either direction.” “Our movement cannot forsake the foundational commitment that we have to security, to limited government, to liberty and to life,” Pence said. “But nor can we allow our movement to be led astray by the siren song of unprincipled populism that’s unmoored from our oldest traditions and most cherished values.” Pence seemed to criticize the “America First” mindset, particularly in the midst of Russia invasion of Ukraine. “As Russia continues its unconscionable war of aggression to Ukraine, I believe that conservatives must make ti clear that Putin must stop and Putin will pay,” he said. “There can be no room in the conservative movement for apologists to Putin. There is only room in this movement for champions of freedom.” Pence at Heritage Foundation making an impassioned plea to continue to help Ukraine. There are those in the movement that \"would have us disengage with the wider world,\" he says. \"But appeasement has never worked.\" — Caitlin Huey-Burns (@CHueyBurns) October 19, 2022 Opposition to isolationist ideals has not stopped Pence from endorsing candidates who have ultimately voiced opposition to involvement in the conflict, including Blake Masters, who is running for an Arizona US senate seat and called the war a “European problem”. 7.52pm BST Mehmet Oz, who is running as the Republican candidate in a key senate race, responded to today’s announcement from his opponent, John Fetterman, that a doctor clear Fetterman to work after a stroke in May. “That’s good news that John Fetterman’s doctor gave him a clean bill of health… Now that he is apparently healthy, he can debate for 90 minutes, start taking live questions from voters and reporters, and do a second debate now too,” a campaign spokesperson said. Oz senior comms adviser Rachel Tripp responds: “That's good news that John Fetterman's doctor gave him a clean bill of health...now that he apparently is healthy, he can debate for 90 minutes, start taking live questions from voters and reporters, and do a second debate now too.” — Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) October 19, 2022 Oz and other Republicans have been using Fetterman’s stroke as an attack against him, saying that he is unfit to be in office. Fetterman’s campaign, on the other hand, has carefully been talking about his stroke as a way to gain empathy from voters. At a rally in Wallingford, Pennsylvania, Fetterman asked the audience if they or a loved one had ever dealt with a serious health issue, and nearly every hand went up. Until the doctor’s report that was released, the last official medical update from Fetterman’s campaign on his health was released in June. 7.28pm BST At his press conference moments ago announcing the release of petroleum from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, Joe Biden was asked to comment on criticism that he was making the announcement for political reasons ahead of the midterms. “I’ve been doing this for how many months now? It’s not politically motivated at all. Its motivation is to make sure that I continue to push on what I’ve been pushing on. And that is making sure there’s enough oil being pumped by the companies so that we have the ability to produce enough gas that we need here at home,” Biden said. “The problem is these guys were asleep. I don’t know where they’ve been.'” Updated at 7.29pm BST 7.12pm BST Biden emphasizes White House role in lowering gas prices ahead of midterms Joe Biden spoke on the release of 15m barrels of petroleum from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a move to seemingly signal to voters ahead of the midterms the White House’s efforts to tamper gas prices. Biden announced earlier this year that the energy department will be released 180m barrels from the strategic reserve this year. The 15m barrels announced today will complete the 180m barrels promised by the White House. The administration says the release will add 500,000 barrels per day of supply to the market in December. In a speech, Biden pointed to the war in Ukraine as the main reason for increasing gas prices and said that he “acted decisively” over the summer, and gas prices in turn have dropped $1.50 per gallon since their peak over the summer. “That’s progress, but they’re not falling fast enough,” Biden said. Gas prices are felt in almost every family in this country. It squeezes family budgets when the price of gas goes up, and other expenses get cut. That’s why I’ve been doing everything in my power to reduce gas prices.” “With my announcement today, we’re going to continue to stabilize markets and decrease the price at a time when the actions of other countries have caused such volatility.” Biden said that he has instructed his team to look into further releases from the reserve in the months ahead if needed. He also defended his administration against “myths” that he has slowed gas production. “Quite the opposite. We’re producing 12m barrels of oil per day. And by the end of the year, we will be producing 1m barrels a day – more than the day in which I took office.” Biden also said that the administration will repurchase crude oil from the strategic reserve once prices fall to $67 to $72 a barrel, incentivizing production for the future, and called on oil and gas companies to pass lower energy costs to consumers. Updated at 7.12pm BST 6.35pm BST Donald Trump in 2021 asked a group of people whether a Jewish documentary filmmaker was “a good Jewish character”, according to a video of the former president that was released as part of footage that was subpoenaed by the House special committee investigating the January 6 insurrection, the New York Times reports. The interaction was recorded by documentary filmmaker Alex Holder at an event at Trump’s New Jersey golf club in May 2021. Trump, speaking to several people, was responding to a woman’s comment about “Jews who didn’t vote for you”. Trump reportedly started talking about how he signed an executive order in 2019 that recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, yet he still polled low with Jewish voters in the US. “In Israel, I’m at like 94 percent, but I got 27, 28 percent [in the US],” Trump said at the time. “In Israel, I’m the most popular. With Orthodox, I’m the most popular.” Trump points to Holder, who is Jewish, “is this a good Jewish character right here?” At the end of the clip, before it cuts off, Trump asks, “You Persian? Very smart. Be careful, they’re very good salesmen.” News of the clip comes on the heels of a post Trump made on his social media platform Truth Social in which he lamented the lack of Jewish support for him despite his pro-Israel policies. “No president has done more for Israel than I have. Somewhat surprisingly, however, our wonderful Evangelicals are far more appreciative of this than the people of Jewish faith, especially those living gin the US,” he wrote. “US Jews have to get their act together and appreciate what they have in Israel – before it is too late!” 6.16pm BST The Guardian’s voting rights reporter Sam Levine writes: Georgia has seen an “astounding” increase in turnout through the first two days of in person early voting, the state’s top election official said on Wednesday. Early voting began on Monday in the state, where there are closely watched gubernatorial and senate races. 268,050 people voted in person during the first two days. At the same point in the 2020 presidential election, 266,403 had voted in person. That differential is notable because presidential elections usually have higher turnout than midterms. At the same point in the 2018 midterms, 147,289 people had voted in person. Georgia has been at the center of high-stakes battles over voting access and this is the first general a new law with sweeping new voting restrictions is in effect. The law shortens the window in which voters can request a mail-in ballot and places new identification requirements on both the mail-in ballot application and ballot itself. Stacey Abrams, the gubernatorial candidate for governor, as well as voting rights groups are encouraging voters to cast their ballots as early as possible to avoid any issues. Republicans in the past have pointed to surging turnout to push back on accusations of voter suppression. But voting advocates say that is misleading and does not take into account the increased obstacles voters face in getting to the polls, even if they are able to navigate them successfully. 5.58pm BST Key Democratic senate candidate approved to work following May stroke John Fetterman’s primary care physician said the Democratic senate candidate for Pennsylvania has no restrictions “and can work full duty in public office” following a stroke in May. Fetterman’s campaign released a detailed medical report today based on an examination that took place on Friday. His doctor, Clifford Chen, said that Fetterman’s strength was normal and has no coordination deficits. He also noted that he “spoke intelligently without cognitive deficits”. Fetterman continues to show symptoms of auditory processing disorder (trouble understanding certain spoken words) but “his communication is significantly improved compared to his first visit, assisted by speech therapy, which he has attended on a regular basis since the stroke.” Currently the lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania, Fetterman is in a heated election for an open Senate seat against celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, who is running as a Trump-endorsed Republican. Fetterman’s campaign celebrated the doctor’s report on Wednesday. “Bad news for Dr. Oz, who has been rooting hard against my recovery: I’m doing great + remain fully ready to serve,” Fetterman tweeted. Bad news for Dr. Oz, who has been rooting hard against my recovery: I'm doing great + remain fully ready to serve So grateful to all of you who've stood with me. I'll be fighting for each and every one of you in D.C. ❤️ https://t.co/RMUCsGpOpG — John Fetterman (@JohnFetterman) October 19, 2022 Polls have shown Fetterman with a slight lead over Oz, though Oz has been narrowing the gap over the last week as the GOP has been hitting voters hard with messaging about Democrats and the economy. Updated at 6.38pm BST 5.28pm BST The Texas state government is sending DNA and fingerprint identification kits to parents with kids in kindergarten through eight grade in case of an emergency. The law that established the kit distribution was passed in 2021 and was meant to “help locate and return a missing or trafficked child”, though the timing of the kits’ distribution has reminded parents of the Uvalde shooting, where 19 children and two adults were killed. In the aftermath of the shooting, parents were asked for DNA samples of their children to help medical examiners identify the victims. AR-15s, the type of gun that was used in the shooting, is a powerful weapon that can leave victims unrecognizable. Brett Cross, the father of a student who was killed in Uvalde, tweeted of the kits: “Yeah! Awesome! Let’s identify kids after they’ve been murdered instead of fixing issues that could ultimately prevent them from being murdered. It’s like wiping your ass before you take a shit.” Yeah! Awesome!

They ain’t go nothing.” .@PunchbowlNews AM: Our wide-ranging interview with @SpeakerPelosi.

But it’s about turnout. So I’m excited. We’ve outraised them, except for their big, dark money, which is endless.” When asked whether she’s worried about House minority leader Kevin McCarthy becoming speaker after the elections, Pelosi said: “We’re going to win this election so I don’t even entertain that notion. But it should be of concern to the Republicans.” Polls are showing a more uncertain future for Democrats, who have been slammed by Republicans over the economy and inflation over the last few weeks. A recent CBS News/YouGov survey found Democrats were two points behind Republicans on the congressional ballot. Updated at 6.36pm BST 4.18pm BST Democrats are using these next three weeks to try to electrify their base, sending out some of their prominent members to stump for candidates and encourage voters to head to the polls.

During a debate with Warnock last week, Walker held up an honorary deputy sheriff’s badge after Warnock attacked him on his claims of being a law enforcement officer. Walker has never been a trained officer, though he has received the endorsement of law enforcement groups. In the debate, the moderator told Walker that props are not allowed on the debate stage. “Let’s talk about the truth,” Walker said while holding his honorary badge. Sen. Raphael Warnock (D): “One thing I have not done — I have never pretended to be a police officer, and I’ve never threatened a shootout with the police.” In response, Herschel Walker (R) pulled out a prop badge: “I am work with many police officers.” pic.twitter.com/Wyh6oYD9zB — Heartland Signal (@HeartlandSignal) October 14, 2022 Now, Walker’s campaign told NBC News that it has ordered 1,000 imitation badges as part of his campaign. “Herschel Walker has been a friend to law enforcement and has a record of honoring police, said Gail Gitcho, Walker’s campaign strategist. “If Senator Warnock wants to highlight this, then bring it on.” 3.09pm BST Steve Bannon, the former chief strategist in the Trump White House who is at the forefront of the Republican march toward hard-right populism, is throwing his weight behind a movement to radically rewrite the US constitution. Bannon has devoted recent episodes of his online show the War Room to a well-funded operation which has stealthily gained ground over the past two years. Backed by billionaire donors and corporate interests, it aims to persuade state legislatures to call a constitutional convention in the hope of baking far-right conservative values into the supreme law of the land. The goal is, in essence, to turn the country into a permanent conservative nation irrespective of the will of the American people. The convention would promote policies that would limit the size and scope of the federal government, set ceilings on or even abolish taxes, free corporations from regulations, and impose restrictions on government action in areas such as abortion, guns and immigration. “This is another line of attack strategically,” Bannon told his viewers last month. “You now have a political movement that understands we need to go after the administrative state.” By “administrative state”, Bannon was referring to the involvement of the federal government and Congress in central aspects of modern American life. That includes combating the climate crisis, setting educational standards and fighting health inequities. Mark Meckler, a founder of the Tea Party who now leads one of the largest groups advocating for the tactic, the Convention of States Action (Cosa), spelled out some of the prime objectives on Bannon’s show. “We need to say constitutionally, ‘No, the federal government cannot be involved in education, or healthcare, or energy, or the environment’,” he said. Meckler went on to divulge the anti-democratic nature of the state convention movement when he said a main aim was to prevent progressive policies being advanced through presidential elections. “The problem is, any time the administration swings back to Democrat – or radical progressive, or Marxist which is what they are – we are going to lose the gains. So you do the structural fix.” The “structural fix” involves Republican state legislatures pushing conservative amendments to America’s foundational document. By cementing the policies into the US constitution, they would become largely immune to electoral challenge. Related: Inside Steve Bannon’s ‘disturbing’ quest to radically rewrite the US constitution Updated at 3.22pm BST 2.41pm BST Florida senator Marco Rubio had an intense debate last night with his opponent, Val Demings, currently a US representative. Demings, who is trying to be Florida’s first Black senator, pushed Rubio on issues ranging from abortion to gun control. Rubio, who is running for a third term, would not confirm whether he would support a federal ban on abortion that has no exceptions for rape on incest but sai, “every bill I have ever sponsored on abortion and every bill I’ve ever voted for has exceptions.” Demings responded by saying, “What we know is that the senator supports no exceptions. He can make his mouth say anything today. He is good at that, by the way. What day is it and what is Marco Rubio saying?” On gun control, Demings asked Rubio, “How long will you watch people being gunned down in first grade, fourth grade, school, college, church, synagogue, grocery store, movie theater, a mall and a nightclub and do nothing,” she asked. Demings is in an uphill battle trying to unseat Rubio in a state that has gone further to the right in recent years. Earlier this month, a poll showed Demings six points behind Rubio.

Joe Biden is set to announce the release of 15m barrels of gas from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve later today as the administration attempts to tamp down gas prices. The national average for gas prices stands at $3.85 a gallon today, according to AAA, slightly higher than the $3.34 a gallon that was seen this time last year. But it’s still lower than this summer, when gas peaked at over $5 a gallon. The move is Biden’s attempt to mitigate growing concerns over the economy as the midterms approach. Democratic candidates in heated races across the country have been facing attacks from their Republican candidates over inflation, which stood at 8.2% in September. Biden will make the announcement around 1 pm today. Here’s what else we’re watching: Donald Trump is heading to DC court today for a deposition in the lawsuit brought by former magazine columnist E Jean Carroll, who accused Trump of sexual assault. Carroll is suing Trump for defamation. A Politico/Morning consult poll shows that Republicans may have an edge over Democrats in the midterms due to the economy: 81% say the economy will play a major role in their vote, and 80% said the same about inflation.

The view of the state as like a household, constrained by a shortage of money, bears no relation to the public monetary largesse of 21st-century states. Since the 1990s deflation crisis in Japan, the financial crisis of 2007-08 and the pandemic, central banks in key economies have been in full flow. However, this has mainly supported the financial sector and the market generally, rather than public welfare. To open up this new agenda, fundamental questions need to be asked about the creation and circulation of money in the 21st century. Why is publicly generated money (QE) used to bolster the (financial) market rather than public services? Why can banks borrow from the central bank, when governments have to borrow from private finance? Why is that government debt, when bought back by the central bank using publicly generated QE, not then cancelled? If Labour is to win the next election (rather than the Tories losing it), it must open a debate about the issue of publicly generated money, and the role of the public economy in building the true wealth (wellth) of the people. Prof Mary Mellor Newcastle upon Tyne • You say that Keir Starmer has had 12 slogans since becoming leader of the Labour party, “each one more meaningless than the last”. May I suggest a very simple one that I really believe would strike a chord with voters: “Labour cares”? I should like to think the party does care about tens of thousands of British children going hungry; about hospices and other charities wondering how they can continue to provide vital services; about the burnout rate of teachers; about the huge problems of staffing etc in the NHS and in our broken social care system; about all those working people who have to depend on food banks; and about the climate crisis that threatens us all. It’s surely time that Sir Keir and others had the courage to speak out – and show us that there is a party worthy of our votes. Joy Webb Penistone, South Yorkshire • I cannot fully agree with your editorial view that Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour party is a mystery. On Brexit, Labour and its leader have been clear and consistent: there will be no entry for the UK into the single market or the customs union. There remains the mystery of how Labour will make a “success” of Brexit – something its advocates and apologists have necessarily failed to do (except perhaps in Northern Ireland, which retains single market access). Your call is for Starmer and Labour to be “bold”: but they cannot be bold while being bound to the lies, imperial nostalgia and exceptionalist fabulations of Brexit; nor can Labour be a force for change while frightened of the conservatism of so-called red wall Labour to Tory swing voters. Labour is a Brexit party. It is not for me. John Hully Royston, Hertfordshire • I read that Labour has not yet found its “killer slogan”.

Speaking at a parliamentary debate on promoting financial security in the Caribbean, Lewis said the issue of reparations could not be dismissed as an obsession among a small group of “so-called woke extremists”. He pointed to the recent announcements by the Trevelyans, an aristocratic British family, who made history by travelling to the Caribbean to publicly apologise for the ownership of more than 1,000 enslaved Africans and committed to paying reparations. “They did what no British government has ever done before. They apologised for their ancestors’ part in the exploitation of the 1,000 slaves they owned on six plantations,” he said. “They acknowledge the financial and cultural advantage this has generated for them and urge the British government, as I will today, to enter into meaningful negotiations with the government of the Caribbeans in order to make appropriate reparations.” Lewis added the announcements by the Trevelyan family had “opened the door of this debate just a little wider”. Lewis went on to liken the relationship between the UK and the Commonwealth to an abusive relationship in which one partner has endured “400 years of the most hideous abuse, one who now seeks not charity, but restitution”. Related: ‘My forefathers did something horribly wrong’: British slave owners’ family to apologise and pay reparations He added: “This country will not be able to move on as a cohesive whole until these issues are resolved.” During the debate, the Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski questioned whether reparations were the best way forward: “I think all members of this house will be incentivised and motivated to ensure that there is the greatest flow of capital to our allies and the Caribbean, but would he not agree with me that more importantly than reparations is giving the Caribbean states active tariff-free access to the United Kingdom, the world’s fifth largest economy, rather than the protectionist racket that they have experienced from the European Union, which inherently tried to restrict the flow of goods from the Caribbean to the European Union?” Kawczynski stated that one of the reasons he campaigned for Brexit was the exclusion of Commonwealth citizens from freedom of movement. In response, Lewis said: “I think we can have both a fair immigration system in this country, which we don’t have at the moment, and we can also have justice for the Caribbean. The two are not controversial and they’re not incompatible.” Among the other handful of MPs at the debate was Labour’s Nadia Whittome, who spoke in support of Lewis. “The case for former colonial powers to pay reparations to the descendants of enslaved peoples is particularly strong,” she said, “given that the UK government was making compensation payments to descendants of enslavers, families and organisations in 2015. “And the reason why reparations is the right and fair thing to do is, yes, because of the legacy of slavery and because wealthier countries like ours extracted and underdeveloped those societies, but also because of our role in the climate crisis – and the fact that threatens the very future of the Caribbean.” In 1835, the Trevelyan family received £26,898, a significant sum at the time, in compensation from the British government for the abolition of slavery a year earlier. The enslaved men, women and children on their plantations received nothing, and were forced to work a further eight years unpaid as “apprentices”.","Id":"world/2023/mar/08/clive-lewis-calls-for-uk-to-negotiate-caribbean-slavery-reparations","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Clive Lewis calls for UK to negotiate Caribbean slavery reparations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/clive-lewis-calls-for-uk-to-negotiate-caribbean-slavery-reparations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/08/clive-lewis-calls-for-uk-to-negotiate-caribbean-slavery-reparations","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":574,"webPublicationDate":"2023-03-08T12:44:32Z","hosted":false,"id":"world/2023/mar/08/clive-lewis-calls-for-uk-to-negotiate-caribbean-slavery-reparations"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"‘Time to end this debate’: ombudsman finds no evidence Daniel Andrews facilitated Victorian Labor’s ‘red shirts’ scheme","body":"Victoria’s ombudsman has found no evidence that the premier, Daniel Andrews, “designed, propagated or facilitated” the so-called “red shirts” scheme that saw almost $400,000 in public funds misused during the 2014 election campaign. In a report tabled in parliament on Thursday, the state’s ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said she was “not prepared to spend further public resources on these matters”. “Is there anything else to investigate? The short answer is no,” Glass said in the report. “Despite assertions to the contrary, there is no persuasive evidence the premier designed, propagated or facilitated the scheme.” Related: Minor parties flag integrity as a Victorian election campaign issue after scathing report In 2018 Glass found Labor misused $388,000 through an arrangement that involved 21 Labor MPs signing off on wages to be paid to casual electorate officers, who were actually working as campaign organisers during the 2014 election. The former treasurer, John Lenders, was singled out in the ombudsman’s investigation, which identified him as the architect of the scheme. Lenders this week stood down from Labor’s campaign committee. The Labor party repaid the money and police did not lay charges, though they raided the homes of 17 former campaign staff at dawn. The matter was largely considered settled until 2020, when allegations of branch stacking were levelled against the Labor factional powerbroker Adem Somyurek. He was dumped from cabinet and quit the party. A joint investigation by the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission and the ombudsman – dubbed Operation Watts – found Somyurek’s moderate faction misused public funds. During the investigation, the MP repeatedly made allegations about other factions and referenced the red shirts scheme. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning. Somyurek, who last week said he had done “absolutely nothing wrong” and felt “liberated” by the Operation Watts findings, told public hearings that Lenders “came up with the scheme” and the premier was aware of it. Earlier this year Somyurek successfully passed a motion in parliament’s upper house to refer the scheme back to the ombudsman. “[Andrews] designed this system,” Somyurek told parliament at the time. “He told me personally, ‘You’ve got to take part in this process whether you want to win or not,’ and that reflected his mentality at the time.” Related: Victorian ministers breached codes in ‘shocking’ misuse of public funds to fuel branch stacking, Ibac finds Glass said the evidence showed Andrews was “involved and immersed in the Red Shirts campaign in 2014, as he necessarily would have been as party leader”. “However, there was no evidence he was aware of what I described in my report as the artifice: the manner in which Mr Lenders had proposed the field organisers would divide their activities and be paid in a split fashion by both the ALP and parliament,” she wrote. Glass said “other than unsupported claims made by Mr Somyurek”, there was no new evidence indicating the premier’s involvement in the scheme since her 2018 report. “It is time to end this debate,” she wrote. “I cannot, of course, rule out that further evidence may yet come to light, but with the passage of time and difficulty in proof I am not prepared to spend further public resources on these matters.” Andrews on Thursday said he was “focused on the future” and would let the ombudsman’s report speak for itself. “These matters have been well canvassed,” he told reporters. But the opposition has seized on the report and Andrews’ comments backing Lenders as a person of the “highest integrity”. “When it comes to Daniel Andrews it’s always someone else’s fault, he’s in charge but never held to account,” opposition government scrutiny spokesperson Louise Staley said in a statement. “Instead of acting to clean up his grubby party, Daniel Andrews continues to defend and promote the mastermind behind a $388,000 theft of taxpayers money.” Glass noted Somyurek had “changed his version of events” between his appearance before Ibac and his 2022 speech at parliament and he would not hand over emails he said supported his claims. The report also reveals Somyurek refused to provide the evidence he gave publicly to police when he was contacted by a detective in November 2021. “It would be a breach of the parliamentary privilege of freedom of speech for me to question Mr Somyurek’s motives or credibility,” Glass wrote. “I refrain from comment and allow the evidence, presented in its entirety, to speak for itself.” Glass said while her jurisdiction does not extend to Victoria police, she believed their 2018 operation, including the dawn arrests, “was a mistake”. “That these issues continue to loom large in the public consciousness as an example of unpunished wrongdoing is a product of many factors, including the police operation in 2018,” she said. “But it is also a product of the unsatisfactory state of the law in relation to the misuse of public funds, and an inadequate system for investigating and sanctioning MPs who break the rules.” Glass said it was “a pity” senior members of Victoria police did not intervene to stop the arrests and suggested they apologise. “It is not clear why MPs were not treated in the same, allegedly heavy-handed, fashion as their staffers,” Glass said. “It may relieve the sense of unfairness that at least some of those arrested must have felt, if senior police command would acknowledge this and apologise to them.” Victoria police said it would not apologise for making the arrests. “Victoria Police acted appropriately when arresting the 17 former field officers,” it said in a statement. “It is not uncommon for simultaneous arrests to occur where there are multiple persons of interest in an evolving investigation.” Other issues – including whether the public service has become politicised, the work of the premier’s social media unit staff and the “new trend” of factional powerbrokers working as lobbyists – will be the subject of an upcoming report from Glass.","Id":"australia-news/2022/jul/28/no-evidence-daniel-andrews-facilitated-victoria-labor-red-shirts-scheme-ombudsman-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"‘Time to end this debate’: ombudsman finds no evidence Daniel Andrews facilitated Victorian Labor’s ‘red shirts’ scheme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/no-evidence-daniel-andrews-facilitated-victoria-labor-red-shirts-scheme-ombudsman-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/no-evidence-daniel-andrews-facilitated-victoria-labor-red-shirts-scheme-ombudsman-finds","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":950,"webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T23:18:33Z","hosted":false,"id":"australia-news/2022/jul/28/no-evidence-daniel-andrews-facilitated-victoria-labor-red-shirts-scheme-ombudsman-finds"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Fallout from leaders’ debate continues as early voting centres open – as it happened","body":"11.00am BST What we learned today, Monday 9 May People’s ears were still ringing today from last night’s debate, but the election campaign rolled on ... and on ...

The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation says the claim is “not only astonishing, it’s offensive”. The federation’s chief executive, Annie Butler, says aged care nurses and workers have been campaigning to fix the crisis “for years”, but were ignored: It was only following the shocking expose on aged care by Four Corners that the prime minister finally acted – not to fix the problems in the sector but to, yet again, ‘kick the can down the road’ by calling a royal commission into safety and quality in aged care.

The falling dollar reflects expectations the US federal reserve, that country’s central bank, will be more aggressive in lifting interest rates than the Reserve Bank of Australia at least in the near term. (Investors move money to where they hope to get a better return.) Australian dollar has dipped below 70 US cents today, a shift that will 'import' more inflation. Expectations the US Fed in the near term will increase interest rates faster than the RBA one of the factors. #ausvotes #auspol pic.twitter.com/qLbi1j8rNL — Peter Hannam (@p_hannam) May 9, 2022 A gauge of six major currencies shows the US currency is now at its highest since 2002, Reuters said. So it’s not just an Australian thing. Still, the Aussie dollar is supported by the fact the country happens to be a big exporter in commodities that are both in high demand and priced in US dollars. And as Westpac said this afternoon: Last week Australia reported its 51st consecutive monthly trade surplus. Coal prices are on the rise again though metals prices have wobbled somewhat as China’s Covid lockdowns continue. Still, a weaker Australian dollar means Australia will import more inflation, and increases the odds the RBA will have to hike the cash rate faster too. Fuel will be among goods that will be more costly as the Aussie dollar slips. (As noted in an earlier post, investors are predicting the RBA’s cash rate will rise from 0.35% after last week’s board meeting to 1% as soon as its July gathering.) While a weaker local dollar isn’t great if you were planning to visit a country where their currency is pegged to the US dollar, there are other attractive places to go. For instance, the Japanese yen has been particularly weak versus the greenback for months, while the Aussie dollar also rose above NZ$1.10 last week for the first time since August 2020, Westpac said.

The Australian Fashion Council (AFC) is likening the trademark to a Tourism Australia campaign, but for fashion. The trademark is the result of $1m in federal funding, from the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources. To qualify for an Australia Fashion Trademark, brands do not have to manufacture in Australia. At the trademark’s launch this morning, The AFC chief executive, Leila Naja Hibri, said when she was asked to attend a government crisis meeting on Australian fashion manufacturing in early 2020, she asked: “What manufacturing?” Chief executive of the Australian Fashion Council, Leila Naja Hibri, speaking at the Australian Fashion Trademark launch at Australian Fashion Week 2022 in Sydney. Photograph: James Gourley/AAP Brands registering for the Australian Fashion Trademark will have to meet two of four criteria: Australian made (for at least 50% of garments certified); Australian majority employees (75% of a brand’s employees must be based in Australia); Australian-owned (also 75%); and Australian tax domiciled. The certification process will also require brands to make commitments around transparency, and social and environmental responsibility. Commitment to “authentic Australian design” is also a requirement, and this includes a specific clause stating brands must “omit any cultural appropriation in the design process”. The trademark eligibility criteria, published today, are relatively strict. This is intentional on the part of the fashion council, who hope to capture ethically conscious consumers through the certification scheme. Hibri described the criteria as “prioritising people and planet, as well as profit”. The launch was targeted specifically to the fashion industry, who are being encourage to apply for the trademark. Domestic and international marketing initiatives around the trademark and qualifying brands are planned for later in the year. The trademark is just the start of a $69m funding ask by the AFC, outlined in a report produced by Ernst & Young, which was also released today. “It’s not more than the government is doing for other sectors,” Hibri said. “Australia has been great at selling wine and tourism,” she said, outlining fashion’s potential to deliver significant economic growth, and more jobs, particularly for women, who make up 77% of the sector. A model walks the runway during the Bondi Born show. The Afterpay Australian Fashion Week 2022 started on Monday in Sydney.

Politics isn’t a frequent topic of discussion at Australian fashion week, but when Hibri said that she looks forward to working with “the next Australian government” it drew stifled murmurs from the room.

In the marginal seat of Wentworth in Sydney’s east, a queue of voters spilled out from the prepoll centre on Oxfords Street in Bondi Junction onto the footpath.

He said: The other parties let us down over the past two and half years, so I had to give it to somebody outside of the two-party system. I never thought I’d actually vote for Clive Palmer or someone like Pauline Hanson, but I just don’t think we’ve been able to have discussions about Covid. Meanwhile, Paddington local Petra O’Neill cast her vote for Spender. O’Neill voted for Sharma at the 2019 election, but said prime minister Scott Morrison’s absence during the black summer bushfires and record on climate action has swayed her vote.

I’ve spoken with the chief executive of BaptistCare NSW and ACT, Charles Moore, who has warned workforce shortages and underfunding are exhausting his staff and driving the sector into an “untenable standstill”. Moore is pleading with whichever party forms government to act immediately to improve aged care funding, warning the current pressures are unsustainable and are hitting vulnerable residents as well as staff. Moore said: Workforce shortages are exhausting our staff and many hard-working people in the sector are barely able to keep up with the cost of living, with inflation rising to a point that’s more than twice the rate of wages growth. Our sector is underfunded and falling into an untenable standstill. It’s impacting both our workers and the most vulnerable in our society, and voters are seeing this too. BaptistCare has also released polling it commissioned on voters’ attitudes to aged care funding and staff pay, conducted by YouGov. It found Australians ranked aged care workers behind only hospital workers in terms of who should be paid the highest. The overwhelming majority of voters said there were important actions the incoming government should take with respect to the aged care sector, with increasing funding the most important, according to the poll.

Albanese says he has one more state to squeeze in today. Updated at 5.19am BST 5.15am BST Albanese tells jousting journos to play “rock, paper, scissors” to see who gets the next question. The winner asks about comments from former prime minister John Howard, who said Australia will need a nuclear power industry to service the planned nuclear-powered submarines. Albanese says: I think Mr Howard’s wrong. And, indeed, the advice and part of the decision-making process in the briefings that we had about Aukus – that included Senator Wong and Richard Marles and Brendan O’Connor – were that you didn’t need a domestic civil nuclear industry in order to support the nuclear submarines. We made very clear our support for nuclear subs. We made that on the basis of the advice that we received. And we stand by it. Albanese also brings up the situation with Liberal National candidate for Lilley, Vivian Lobo: Because I’m not sure he’s been asked, but I do want to say that the prime minister needs to do more to respond to the referral of the candidate for Lilley to the Australian Federal Police by the Australian Electoral Commission. This is a really serious issue and the prime minister needs to respond as to what action he will take on this issue.

Labor wouldn’t “revisit” that deal, Chalmers says: There’s a deal that’s been done between the commonwealth and the states, which we have said in all of the capital cities right around Australia that we intend to honour. We totally understand, whether it’s premier Malinauskas or other premiers of both political persuasions around Australia, their job is to advocate for the best deal that they can get. And our job is to weigh that all up. But we’ve made it very clear – Anthony has, I have – that we don’t intend to revisit the current deal.

Wong says it’ll take a “lot of work” to address the issues in the Pacific: If it’s true, it demonstrates the seriousness of what has occurred on Mr Morrison’s watch. It also demonstrates that the sort of tough words he’s talking about, or trying to use, about “red lines”, don’t appear, if the reports are correct, to be the way forward, or appear to have much effect. What we have to do is to work with the whole Pacific family, the whole Pacific family. Updated at 5.26am BST 5.07am BST Q: So it’s just a coincidence that you’re pumping money into a hospital in a marginal seat? Albanese says “it’s needed right now”. He also says Labor will have more to say on health, when asked if his team would look at the funding split between the state and federal governments. Updated at 5.08am BST 5.06am BST Q: Is this a “naked use” of money in an election campaign, and wouldn’t systemic reform be better? “The states run the health system,” Albanese says, adding that this project was chosen “based on priorities”: What I am planning to do, though, is to sit down constructively with all state governments, based on their priorities. He says he and Malinauskas spoke before the state election (which Malinauskas won at quite a trot), and: If we’re successful, one of the first things I will do is to convene a meeting with state premiers and chief ministers – I want to work with all of them. And state premiers are in the best position on the ground to say what their priorities for service delivery are. This project is an important project.

He has Penny Wong and Anthony Albanese standing behind him 4.57am BST Labor makes SA health announcement The South Australian Labor premier ,Peter Malinauskas, has headline billing in this second press conference, in Boothby – which Labor is hoping to *finally* take from the Liberals. I think the Liberal party in South Australia for too long and certainly the federal Coalition, has take then seat for granted. It’s neglected the principal concerns that residents in this community want and the number one thing on the minds of constituents in the southern suburbs including in Boothby is a health system that works a state Labor government partnering with a federal government, we will deliver far more outcomes. The announcement is for a $400m upgrade to the Flinders hospital. Malinauskas gets the first question. Updated at 4.59am BST 4.53am BST I just keep coming back to this from Scott Morrison’s most recent press conference: Businesses can make wages go up. When businesses are doing well and when unemployment is going down, then wages go up. That is how it works. That is exactly what the Reserve Bank governor was saying. When he was noting that wage rises are starting to happen now, we have been waiting for them for some time, we have seen unemployment under our government come from 5.7%, down to 4%, which is the equal lowest level in 48 years. Youth unemployment, which is incredibly important here, has gone to 8.3%. That is the lowest level since August of 2008. Young people in apprenticeships just like this, all around the country getting into jobs. Businesses in a weak economy will not be able to afford wage rises. Businesses in a strong economy, that is a whole different story. Businesses in an economy where unemployment is falling as the Reserve Bank governor said to 3.5%, that is what can support wage rises. There is no magic pen from Anthony Albanese that makes your wages go up. There is no law you pass that makes your wages go up. What makes wages go up is a strong economy where businesses are doing well and they can ensure that they can pay staff even better and above award rates which we see in so many companies across the country. Australia’s economy, as Grogs has pointed out on multiple occasions, was in trouble *before the pandemic*. Wages in real terms have non-risen since before the last election (the last time we were all talking about this and Mathias Cormann said it was a deliberate feature of the economic architecture to fight inflation, which was already very low). So what does that say about the economy under the Morrison government? Updated at 4.57am BST 4.39am BST National Covid-19 update Here are the latest coronavirus case numbers from around Australia on Monday, as the country records three deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 0 Cases: 812 In hospital: 72 (with 3 people in ICU) NSW Deaths: 3 Cases: 7,793 In hospital: 1,548 (with 54 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: Cases: 202 In hospital: 38 (with 0 people in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 0 Cases: 4,750 In hospital: 439 (with 12 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 0 Cases: 2,984 In hospital: 228 (with 10 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 0 Cases: 841 In hospital: 44 (with 1 people in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 0 Cases: 10,031 In hospital: 491 (with 43 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 0 Cases: 10,394 In hospital: 279 (with 6 people in ICU) 4.30am BST The Weekly Times is holding an online crossbench debate this evening: The Weekly Times and the NFF will host an online roundtable debate between regional crossbench MPs Bob Katter (Kennedy, QLD), Helen Haines (Indi, VIC) and Rebekha Sharkie (Mayo, SA) tonight at 8pm AEST. Watch the debate LIVE on The Weekly Times website (video to appear at this link from 8pm). Updated at 4.32am BST 4.26am BST You can see Scott Morrison’s strategy there. He is now talking about what could happen if Australia “drops its economic shield” and votes Labor, as well as working as hard as he can to discredit Labor’s policy announcements. There was a lot to factcheck in those statements, but as a general overview, Labor’s housing shared equity scheme works like ones which have been established in other jurisdictions, including WA for three decades. If you begin earning over the scheme’s equity cap, the government does not sell your house – you have two years to buy out the equity share. Morrison also said that will make your mortgage grow by $250,000/$300,000 if you buy out the government, which is true – but you would not have been able to afford the house in the first place without the government’s equity scheme and if you are earning over the cap, you are better-placed to be approved for the mortgage you wanted in the first place. On Labor’s transmission scheme, it will be an independent panel who decides which projects are needed, so it’s not a willy-nilly process. No matter who wins the election, there will be an aged care and health care staffing shortage which will need to be addressed. The stage three tax cuts are legislated and Labor (in the end) supported the legislation’s passage through the parliament. Wage growth in Australia has been at historic lows (in real terms) for the past decade. Updated at 4.33am BST 4.15am BST Morrison bypasses question on opinion poll slide Q: Opinion polls suggest that Labor has gained ground since the RBA rate rise. The Coalition’s vote has deteriorated along with your personal approval rating. Why do you think this is happening at this stage of the race? Scott Morrison: There is two weeks to go and a choice is going to be made. Right now, today ... Q: Why do you think voters are marking you down? Morrison: Voters are turning up to vote in pre-poll right now. They are making a choice right now and over the course of this campaign, people are making assessments and so many, as we are seeing, are still to make a decision over the next couple of weeks. I said at the rally yesterday, if you looked at this election campaign as if it were a job interview, let’s look at what Anthony Albanese has done through this campaign. If you are having a job interview and you ask them: there is something you need to know about the economy if you want to run it – what is the unemployment rate? What is the cash rate? Didn’t know. His aged care policy will shut down aged care facilities across the country because he doesn’t know how to get the nurses. His health care policy, he said was costed, but it was uncosted. The reporter tries to interject and say they were asking about what he is going to do, but Morrison ploughs on: ... He couldn’t understand what his own policy, putting forward on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, he couldn’t explain that to you. That doesn’t sound like a person who deserves a second interview, let alone the job. Australians are needing to make that decision. They will make that decision and I have submitted myself freely and openly and happily because that is the democracy in which we live so Australians can make that choice. It is a real choice. On Wednesday night we will have the opportunity to discuss these issues even more. As Australians go to the polls, they are starting to focus on the choice that they have to make and it is a choice between strength, a strong economy and a weaker one under Labor. It is a choice about a government that you do know, and an economic plan that is working and can support Australians and provide that economic shield into the future, or a Labor party that is still – less than two weeks away [from the election], and they are yet to articulate an economic plan. They are yet to submit one policy to the costings process, and they have $50 billion in unexplained debt they are putting on the balance sheet which they are yet to fully explain to Australians, and they will have higher deficits. It is a choice between Anthony Albanese and his inability to manage money ... Q: But they are choosing him – why? Morrison [acting like he didn’t hear]: ... And we have demonstrated strength on economic policy and national security policy that is keeping Australians safe, and keeping Australians together, in some of the most difficult times we have ever had to manage as a country, and it is keeping our economy strong. Thank you. Updated at 4.27am BST 4.11am BST Q: On a local project, last week the government announced $85 million for the Mineldra plant on the Shoalhaven, that was announced and I can’t figure out whether it is equity or debt – Mr Constance may want to comment – and the boss is a donor to the Liberal party. Don’t there need to be safeguards about what the money is for – I can’t figure out whether it is debt or equity. Will taxpayers get that money back? Scott Morrison gives this question to Andrew Constance, who is his candidate (not a minister). Constance says: It is a $85 million announcement to reduce carbon emissions out of the Shoalhaven’s largest employer by 300,000 tonnes a year. The Liberals and Nationals get on with dealing with emissions with this type of investment. It is towards a capital contribution towards the cogeneration plant which is ... ... It is a contribution to dealing with getting Australia to net zero emissions. To reduce emissions by 45%, generating hundreds of jobs here in the Shoalhaven, right decision to be made, absolutely the right decision to be made given the incredible product that is produced by Minildra in terms of the circular economy. That was the investment that was announced. Albo turned up there and didn’t announce anything. He turned up and just stood there. Q: That announcement is going to come regardless of who is elected. Constance: 300,000 tonnes of carbon emissions being reduced here in the Shoalhaven by our largest employer is worthy of support. Updated at 4.26am BST 4.09am BST Q: Can you make wages go up? [What is your plan?] Scott Morrison: Businesses can make wages go up. When businesses are doing well and when unemployment is going down, then wages go up. That is how it works*. That is exactly what the Reserve Bank governor was saying. When he was noting that wage rises are starting to happen now, we have been waiting for them for some time, we have seen unemployment under our government come from 5.7%, down to 4%, which is the equal lowest level in 48 years. Youth unemployment, which is incredibly important here, has gone to 8.3%. That is the lowest level since August of 2008. Young people in apprenticeships just like this, all around the country getting into jobs. Businesses in a weak economy will not be able to afford wage rises. Businesses in a strong economy, that is a whole different story**. Businesses in an economy where unemployment is falling as the Reserve Bank governor said to 3.5%, that is what can support wage rises. There is no magic pen from Anthony Albanese that makes your wages go up. There is no law you pass that makes your wages go up. What makes wages go up is a strong economy where businesses are doing well and they can ensure that they can pay staff even better and above award rates which we see in so many companies across the country ... ... The other thing we are doing is keeping electricity prices down ... Putting downward pressure on electricity prices, and I would say also downward pressure on rising inflation and downward pressure on rising interest rates. When you compare Australia to the rest of the world, we are at 5.1% for inflation. Much higher than any of us would like. Across the ditch in New Zealand it is almost 7%. Same in Canada. Go to the United States and it is 8.5%. Interest rates here, 0.35%. You go across the ditch and it went up by 125 basis points and 90 in the UK and 75 basis points in Canada and the United States. Our economic shield, which was the question, is proving very effective when you compare what is happening in other countries. You take that shield down with the election of a Labor government and you will feel the same pressures that are being felt in other advanced economies. *There has been stagnant wage growth for the last decade, when the Coalition has been in power **Given the lack of real wage growth in the last three years, has the economy been weak or strong? Updated at 4.15am BST 4.06am BST Q: [Alan Tudge didn’t register a] property transfer in 2018 for six months. What happened, and is he in breach of the ministerial code? Scott Morrison: No, he’s not, he updated those arrangements consistent with the code. They were late on the other registers. He is in compliance. Updated at 4.13am BST 4.05am BST Q: Prime minister, a leaked version of an MOU between Beijing and Solomons to corporate on building wharves and maritime infrastructure emerged. Is Australia aware that was being negotiated? How can we be sure it won’t ultimately be used by the Chinese military? Is this a further erosion of the trust between our government and the Solomons if they are negotiating further deals with Beijing that are only being known about by being leaked? Scott Morrison: We’re very aware of what the Chinese government’s ambitions are in the Pacific, whether it be in relation to facilities such as that or naval bases or other presence of their military in the Pacific. They’re doing this all around the world. I don’t think there’s any great secret about that. We are very aware of what’s happening in our region and of the pressures there are that the Chinese government is seeking to put on countries across our region. As I mentioned many times, there are 19 Pacific Island countries within the Pacific Islands Forum and so that is a broad family that we must work with, and do all the time, to ensure that we’re seeking to protect not just Australia’s national interest, but the point I was making last night, I don’t believe it’s in the Solomon Islands’ national interest. That is ultimately a matter for the people of the Solomon Islands. I am very concerned, as many other Pacific leaders are, about the interference and intrusion of the Chinese government into these types of arrangements and what that can mean for the peace, stability and security of the south-west Pacific. That is why the Pacific step-up is in place. That is why we have lifted our overseas development assistance to $1.85 billion a year, why we have been investing heavily in the infrastructure, particularly communications and energy infrastructure, across the Pacific Islands regions and that is why we’ve been supporting them in every health crisis they’ve had, whether it was Covid, or whether it was measles, up in Samoa or the humanitarian crisis we moved so quickly to be over in Tonga to support the people there. The first call when these things happen in our region, from any of our Pacific family, is to Australia. That remains the case. Indeed, Australian federal police remain on the ground in Honiara now. Updated at 4.12am BST 3.59am BST Civil nuclear industry 'not' inevitable, says Scott Morrison Q: On John Howard’s comments yesterday. He said the Aukus deal would make it inevitable we would have a civil nuclear industry. Do you agree? If not, why not? Scott Morrison: No, I don’t think that is inevitable. That’s not the basis of the decision ... the fact we were able to go forward with nuclear-powered submarines without having a civil nuclear industry was one of the key changes that enabled us to go forward with the agreement itself. Previously, that had been a requirement – and one of the key technology changes in the development of nuclear-powered submarines that we work through, particularly with the United States, over that long 18-month period, was it didn’t require such a civil nuclear capability to go forward with the acquisition of that fleet. So, I see the issues as separate. Updated at 4.03am BST 3.58am BST Q: A question about regional news. We can’t wait for a green paper to be delivered and $10 million won’t fix the issues we have in our regions. Scott Morrison: Print media or broadcast? Q: Regional broadcast media. Morrison: As you know, there is a package for print media ... Reporter: I understand that ... Can you just wait for the rest of my question? Morrison: Sorry. Q: The rest is, will you scrap spectrum fees and support anti-siphoning laws? If you don’t, our regional newsroom will also crumble. Morrison: First of all, when it comes to regional print media, we have a package in place and the reason that was put in place was because of the massive escalation in printing costs. That would have driven regional newspapers out of business. So the communications minister worked with the industry to ensure that we can provide that support to keep the regional print titles in place, and I’m pleased we’re able to do that. Regional print media and indeed broad cast, plays an important role in local communities. It shouldn’t just be the ABC. I think it is important there are other commercial opportunities and voices out there, providing regional news across Australia. In the terms of spectrum, I know they’re under consideration by the communications minister. On the issue of siphoning, we addressed that last night. The Labor party and the Coalition had the same policy for review of that after the election. Updated at 4.02am BST 3.55am BST Q: Prime Minister, in 2018, Senator Rex Patrick said he obtained a defence study that revealed Newcastle, Brisbane, Port Kembla scored poorly in accommodating a subs base. The best was Sydney, followed by Jervis Bay – the residents are concerned a subs base might be there one day. Can you rule out that as a site? Scott Morrison: I can, it’s not one of the shortlisted sites at all. Updated at 4.16am BST 3.54am BST Q: You’ve both been pretty heavily criticised for the way you behaved in the debate, particularly the treatment, pretty dismissive, of the female moderator. In hindsight, do you wish you’d acted differently? Scott Morrison: Well, I think the way the debate was set up made it often very difficult to hear in the room itself. It was a spirited debate. I think Australians expect spirited debate and the last one was a bit more measured. I hope the one on Wednesday, well, the way the rules work, maybe that will help the moderator a bit more on that occasion. It was a debate. It’s a spirited debate. There’s an election [campaign on]. The reporter asks about it being a woman being spoken over. Morrison says: I don’t think gender had anything to do with it, frankly. I don’t believe gender had anything to do with it. I’m surprised why it would. Both Anthony and I think are completely respectful, have always been respectful of females in the workplace and certainly when we work professionally with them in an environment like. That – I don’t think it would have made, I don’t think it had any bearing on that issue at all. Updated at 4.00am BST 3.52am BST Now Scott Morrison is criticising Labor’s “help to buy” policy which he calls “forced to sell”. This sounds like all the points he wanted to make in the debate and didn’t get an opportunity to. That’s why Australians are really asking the question about whether this job is too big for [Albanese] and whether he’s up for it. Updated at 3.56am BST 3.50am BST Perhaps sensing that he won’t get asked anything in the press conference where he can raise this, Scott Morrison extends his press conference spiel to include this: Now, before I go to questions, let me make a couple of points about last night’s debate. It was a pretty spirited debate, I’m sure everybody will agree. These are passionate topics, this is a big choice – future of the country, future of our economy, the ability to pay for important services like Medicare, aged care, all of these things. Plenty of people can talk about the problems – the leader of the opposition, Anthony Albanese, did a lot of talking about the problems last night – but we didn’t hear any solutions. You can talk about aged care, talk about Medicare, you can talk about childcare, but he didn’t tell you the childcare policy cost $63 billion. You can’t go and make commitments like that if you don’t have an economy that can pay for it. He goes on to criticise Labor’s power policy and Anthony Albanese’s refusal to guarantee wage growth. Updated at 3.54am BST 3.45am BST Scott Morrison pushes defence funding message The PM is back in the Labor-held marginal seat of Gilmore, and it’s all about defence spending: When I became prime minister three and a half years ago, I said that I wanted to keep our economy strong. I said I wanted to keep Australians safe and I wanted to keep Australians together. That has been our challenge over the last three years, particularly as we’ve come through Covid. Keeping the economy strong means we can do the other things that are so important. Australia’s national security doesn’t happen by accident. It requires a government that understands it, is deeply committed to it and is prepared to make the decisions to enhance our capability and give our defence forces the support they need.

So what are you hiding from voters until after the election? Morrison: Absolutely nothing. Q: And that was in relation – Morrison: I mean, the budget contained over 200 specific measures. Q: Her comments were in relation to religious discrimination. Morrison: ... that all set out what our agenda is. And over the course of this election, we’ve been setting out policies each and every day. Now, the Labor party hasn’t been doing that. They’ve had three years. We’ve done three budgets since the last election and we’ve announced more policy in this election than Mr Albanese has even attempted to do. Q: Sussan Ley’s response was in relation to religious discrimination amendments specifically. Morrison: So we have a Labor party with Mr Albanese who has announced more reviews than he has policies. As he said yesterday that he wants to hit the ground reviewing, not running the country. And we’ve got the shadow treasurer who’s out there today making it very clear that Labor’s deficits will be higher and you won’t find out what’s in a Labor budget until October. Now we’ve been waiting three years to hear the economic plan of Mr Albanese. Three years. Nothing. Zilch. Zero. Absolutely nothing. And now he’s saying you have to wait ‘till October. You know, you don’t get to run for prime minister on the basis of just saying, it’s your turn. You have to actually have stumped up and presented the Australian people with an outline of what your economic plan is. Even an outline would do, but he hasn’t even managed that. So this election really is a choice ... Labor doesn’t know what they’re going to do, and as a result they don’t deserve your vote, because they account to just too much risk at a time like this.

As things stand, though, the property market has already lost its sizzle, at least in Sydney and Melbourne. Brigid Delaney colourfully described the shifting mood over this past weekend – the first test since the RBA lifted its cash rate last Tuesday. CoreLogic has firmed up the clearance details further this morning, and it’s not looking promising if you were aiming to sell at the top of the market: Preliminary data from CoreLogic shows big falls in auction clearance rates (vs year ago) in Sydney and Melbourne, the first test after the RBA lifted the cash rate. Rates are also the lowest so far in 2022, CoreLogic says. #auspol #ausvotes #ausvotes2022 pic.twitter.com/y6hnWvoQHj — Peter Hannam (@p_hannam) May 9, 2022 In the past week, just over 2,000 homes went to auction across the capital cities, with Melbourne and Sydney making up about three-quarters of the total, CoreLogic said. That tally was down a quarter from the previous week, and a third lower than this time a year ago. Of the 1,611 results collected so far, 64.7% were successful, once again overtaking the previous week as the lowest preliminary clearance rate recorded so far this year,” the data group says. A week earlier, the revised figure came in at 62.9%, so the preliminary clearance rate could drop below 60%, which would be the first time since August 2021 during the depths of the east coast Covid lockdowns. Sydney, the most expensive major city in Australia (and right up there, globally), the conditions were worse than the average. This past week’s auctions were off 43% from a year ago, and down about a third on the previous week. The harbour city’s preliminary clearance rate of 58.7%will drop a few percentage points or more. Excluding a pre-Australia Day week in January (more sausages), this past week looks like being Sydney’s worst clearance rate since April 2020. If confidence is beginning to evaporate already after one RBA rate rise, you have to wonder at what it will look like if investors are even partly on the money: A reminder if you needed it where investors are betting the RBA's cash rate to go. A rise to 0.6% at the bank's June meeting seems reasonably, but lifting it above 1% by August seems a bit unlikely. #auspol #ausvotes #AusVotes2022 pic.twitter.com/C5jOmwVs2E — Peter Hannam (@p_hannam) May 9, 2022 UNSW researchers like Hal Pawson and Chris Martin have made the point about how much we’ve managed to hitch our economy’s fortunes to the property market.

At a forum at the Australian National University, Conroy was asked about the following statement in the 2021 Labor platform: Labor will, over time, achieve a funding target for the international development program of at least 0.5 per cent of Gross National Income. Labor will increase aid as a percentage of Gross National Income every year that we are in office starting with our first budget. Asked whether that might be achievable in a first term of a Labor government, Conroy says: Repairing Australia’s ODA budget is going to take a long time and concerted resources … I’m not going to give you that guarantee of reaching it in a first term. Development policy observers have noted that the Australian government’s own figures for the 2022-23 financial year suggest ODA as a share of GNI is expected to fall to 0.2%. Conroy says Labor has made a “down payment” by announcing $525m extra for ODA for the Pacific and Timor-Leste over four years, and that people should expect further announcements soon regarding Labor priorities for south-east Asia, the rest of world and multilateral institutions. He suggests there will be a broader ODA figure released “before the election”. Conroy says improving support for the Pacific was important before the Solomon Islands deal: We have not just woken up to it now. Conroy says he can’t emphasise enough “how shortsighted it was to halve assistance to Indonesia”. He says Labor takes international development seriously and regards it as a critical arm of the broader foreign affairs and security strategies. Updated at 1.58am BST 1.38am BST Labor has vowed that its promise of $525m extra in aid for the Pacific and Timor-Leste won’t be funded by cuts to the rest of the Official Development Assistant (ODA) budget. The opposition’s spokesperson on international development and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, has been addressing a forum at the Australian National University. Conroy argued the government’s Pacific Step Up “was funded by a step down everywhere else in the world”. He said Labor’s previously announced $525m in extra ODA for the region over four years would be in addition to the existing overall ODA budget. Conroy has been stepping through elements of Labor’s Pacific policy, which includes a pledge to take the region’s concerns about the climate crisis seriously. He notes Scott Morrison and others in the government call Pacific Islands countries family: Who needs family if they blatantly disregard an issue you see as your greatest threat. Conroy says Morrison says the Coalition is committed to net zero by 2050 “but his coalition is hopelessly divided on it” with Barnaby Joyce implying the target is non-binding. More broadly, Conroy announces a Labor government would increase funding for the Australian NGO Cooperation Programme – in which NGOs run community-based projects – by $32m over four years.

From her statement: The Australian Greens will move in the next parliament to establish an Independent Debates Commission to oversee live television election debates, with last night’s leaders’ debate once again proving to be a farce. Greens spokesperson for media and communications Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said: “Last night’s debate was woeful and a disservice to voters. “Those of us who suffered through it watched two grown men – so-called leaders – shouting at each other, interrupting, smirking and aggressively talking over the top of others including the female moderator. “Australians shouldn’t be subjected to this unseemly squabble again. An election debate should be a contest of ideas and vision for our country, not chest-thumping. “We need an Independent Debates Commission that oversees the official election debate.

Photograph: Asanka Ratnayake/Getty Images Updated at 1.45am BST 1.14am BST There was a lot in that debate which needs fact checking, but Scott Morrison’s reverse ferret on his “it’s not a race” statement in relation to vaccine procurement stands out. It was a race Anthony and we shouldn’t have described it in those terms. Because for months after, Morrison rejected he was ever talking about vaccine procurement: When we made those remarks, we were talking about the regulation of the vaccines. I’m not sure if people are aware of that.” [July 2021] So not only did he say “we” (he) was wrong, it also throws into the spotlight how he tried to spin the comment in the months following.

Increase access to justice by reducing the amount of pre-action forms required to be completed and fund the pre-action procedure process for vulnerable people. 4.

Anthony Albanese: I want a majority Labor government. That is my position and I will be working every day for 76 ... I think we should have 150 Labor members in the House of Representatives. That is my starting point. I think we will fall short of that. But my objective is 76. Thanks, very much, see you in Adelaide. And the press conference ends. Updated at 12.24am BST 12.19am BST Q: The debate got fiery last night by both you and Scott Morrison. You mentioned disillusioned voters last night, what are they meant to make of two leaders shouting at each other? Anthony Albanese: Scott Morrison didn’t have anything to say except shouting. He only had smears and that smirk throughout it all. Last night I put forward ideas about cheaper childcare. Our ideas about cheaper energy bills and dealing with climate change, our ideas about making more things here, our ideas about lifting living standards through practical measures to lift wages. Our plans for more affordable housing, for addressing those issues, whether it be social housing or our help to buy program. They are the positive policies we put forward. I ask to you think about what were the policy measures that Scott Morrison said he would do in his fourth term if he’s elected? If he is given three more years, we can’t afford three more years of the same, three more years of smears and scares. That is all this government has got. In their drops to newspapers, breathtakingly reported like Labor has an off-budget program to build social housing, using the interest from the housing Australia Future Fund, then if that is all they’ve got, they are out of time and ideas. Updated at 12.22am BST 12.18am BST Q: You have gone to this election promising to increase wages, given the fact that inflation is going to be double what wages growth is, isn’t that a massive hole in your central platform that you won’t be able to deliver on something you’re promising now? Anthony Albanese: Not at all. There are two approaches towards wages at this election. Scott Morrison and his government, who want low wage growth to be a key feature of their economic architecture, they have said that. Explicitly they have said that, the former finance minister and Labor which understands that we don’t want people to be left behind, we don’t want peoples’ living standards to be falling and that is our approach. That is why we support wage increases for aged care workers. That is why we want to change the definition of the way that areas like the gender issues operate, so there has only been one successful case in the 21 that have been taken over recent years, going way back and in 2012 – you asked the question and now you get the answer. That is the way it works. In 2012, we successfully, as the Labor government, put forward a submission for the social and community services award. What that did was lead to an increase in pay that kept communities sector workers working in that sector. That led to higher wages, particularly for women in that sector. That is what we did. We will continue to make practical measures that make a difference, including same job, same pay and just one difference as well that I can’t understand this government. Government had legislation before the parliament to outlaw wage theft and make it a crime and they withdrew it. They withdrew it even though it had overwhelming support. It says it all about this government. At the same time, they had legislation which wanted to get rid of the better off overall test. You only want to get rid of the better off overall test if you don’t want people to be better off overall. Updated at 12.23am BST 12.16am BST Q: On last night you [said] negative gearing being a good thing. That is the exact opposite of your party’s policy from the last election. Did you not support that policy and just not speak up at all? Doesn’t negative gearing contribute to an overheated housing market? Anthony Albanese: We weren’t successful at the last election. We have come up with a better housing policy that we are taking to this election. Updated at 12.18am BST 12.15am BST Q: On your economic plan, Labor’s budget spending plans are going to see the nation’s debt balloon by another $52bn to pay for your climate change and affordable housing programs. With deficits set to increase by $10bn under your government, doesn’t this threaten your attacks on the Coalition over economic management and will you commit to budget repair? Anthony Albanese: They are getting desperate, aren’t they? Here we have spending that is on the same basis as the National Broadband Network, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation that they tried to abolish. This is an investment that produces a return. You only have off budget commitments if it produces a return to the government. For example, our housing Australia Future Fund will see $10bn invested through the Future Fund, by the way, which was established and Peter Costello and others were appointed to and the interest on that, the interest on that to be used to invest in social housing. This is good policy. It makes sense and it will make a difference. Updated at 12.20am BST 12.14am BST Q: You had a meeting with the Archbishop this morning. What did you discuss with him and are you concerned about religious voters going away from the Labor party? Anthony Albanese: Not at all. I know his Grace very well. You won’t be surprised by that, given I am an ex student of this school. We meet regularly and when I meet with a Catholic Archbishop or my local priest, it is not the subject of public information, it was a private chat, wasn’t terribly political. It is on a personal level, I regard Anthony Fisher as someone who is a friend, he is Archbishop, and we discussed a range of personal issues and it included Catholic education and how important it is. Updated at 12.15am BST 12.13am BST Q: On wages, you said last night you will try to lift real wages but you couldn’t guarantee it. Why won’t you make that guarantee and is that the ambitious message you want to take to voters? Anthony Albanese: I am very confident that working with business and unions – you will recall – I think you were at the speech I gave at the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry last week, a serious speech of half an hour to 150 business leaders. The Reserve Bank over a long period of time has warned that one of the weaknesses in the economy was the falling real wages. They referred to that consistently over a number of years. The truth is we have had flatlining wages over 10 years. The key to lifting wages is lifting productivity. One of the things I will do, first things I will do is to convene a full employment summit. We will have a full employment white paper. We will work with business and unions to enterprise bargaining but we will change the Act so secure work is an objective of the Act. We will make gender pay equity an objective as well. We have a range of policies aimed towards that. The other thing we need to do is to recognise that so many people are doing it just so tough. Half a million Australians are working three or more jobs. People in the aged care sector are earning as little as $22 an hour. The minimum wage is $20.33. If you are working $22 an hour in what is a tough job – it is tough physically but it is incredibly tough emotionally and on people’s mental health which is why people are leaving the sector. We need to address that. Our clear objective is to lift up living standards. That is our objective. That is what we will work on. It stands in stark contrast. The prime minister last night – I got two questions to the prime minister, one of them I thought was pretty easy, which is should people be paid the minimum wage? You know what he said? “It depends.” He couldn’t even say that Australian workers should be paid the minimum wage. Updated at 12.17am BST 12.11am BST Q: During the religious discrimination debate you said a Labor government would act to protect all students, gay and transgender. How soon will this occur if Labor wins government? Tanya Plibersek: Labor has been very clear that we support action to protect people of faith from discrimination on the basis of religion. We have been consistently clear that we don’t want to see any child discriminated against, any legislation will be done in the normal way. If we form government we will consult widely on the legislation. We don’t want to do what Scott Morrison has done which is divide the nation by introducing this type of legislation.

We can’t afford three more years of the same, with a government that won’t acknowledge the problems that are there, let alone provide solutions for it. This government thinks that people have got it easy. The truth is that they haven’t. We are facing real challenges and one of the challenges is how we become a smarter country, how we deal with education and training and that is what today’s announcement is about.

Appearing at a candidates’ debate hosted by the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies on Sunday night, Sharma was asked about his how-to-vote material which urges voters to preference UAP candidate Natalie Dumer second, given the party had “platformed neo-Nazi” voices in the past. Sharma responded by saying “preferencing someone does not amount to an endorsement of their policies” and that “it’s just something you need to put on the ballot paper”. He said that given the “historical pattern” of voting in Wentworth, the Liberal candidate finished first so preferences made little difference. Sharma added: “I would say to each of you who are Wentworth residents, number the boxes however you’d like.” Sharma’s comments that preferences aren’t an endorsement of a party’s policies follows his criticism of Allegra Spender, the teal independent challenging him in Wentworth, for not including any preference directions to voters on her voting pamphlets. “She will not say who she will support in a hung parliament, all but guaranteeing the chaos of minority government. She even refuses to disclose her preferences so as not to show her hand,” Sharma told SBS news last week. The Liberal party holds Wentworth on a slim margin of 1.3%, and at Sunday’s debate both Sharma and Spender were appealing to the 12.5% of the electorate who are Jewish.

That’s expected to be held fairly early this morning. Updated at 11.33pm BST 11.31pm BST The religious discrimination bill became an issue over the weekend, with Scott Morrison saying he remained committed to passing it through the parliament, while also claiming gay students were not being expelled from religious schools. Paul Karp covers that off here: Related: Scott Morrison defends delaying protections for LGBTQ students as party tensions resurface Jason Clare spoke on that too: We support the introduction of legislation to deal with religious discrimination. I got to tell you – as somebody who represents a really multicultural part of Australia in the western suburbs of Sydney, you know, I know that people get discriminated against based on their faith, whether it’s the cross they wear around their neck or whether it’s the hijab that they wear in the streets, you know, I see and hear stories of people being discriminated against. So we should be taking action there. But we should be good enough and capable enough to be able to do this in a way that deals with all sorts of discrimination and doesn’t discriminate others more by trying to solve one problem. You know, we should be able to do all of that and I fear that what the prime minister is doing here is trying to tackle one issue, not another. One of the consequences of that, though, is he’s got a divided party. He’s got his own members here they’ll they cross the floor again. But he also said there was no reason protections for LGBTIQ students can’t be done at the same time: You know, remember – we have some of the highest rates of teenage suicide in the world. Some of the most vulnerable kids here that are affected by this debate are relying upon us to act with maturity, to act with a bit of wisdom here and I think it’s not beyond us as a parliament to do it. Updated at 11.38pm BST 11.23pm BST Jason Clare says Labor’s policy will have ongoing wider impacts: There aren’t many jobs, aren’t many professions more important than a teacher. I think we can all think of a teacher that shaped our life, changed our life. A quick shoutout to Peter, Peter Valenti if you’re watching today, mate, I still keep in touch with Peter today. We still catch up a couple of times a year. Teachers can change your lives. We got two challenges at the moment. One, we got a general teach shortage. It’s expect that there’ll be a shortage of around 4,000 teachers within the next couple of years. And we’re not getting enough people who get the top marks in the HSC in their Atars going into teaching. If you go back 30 years, then 30% of the people who got top marks went into teaching. It’s now only about 3% and that’s in stark contrast to places like Finland as well as Singapore. These financial payments are about encouraging more people to become teachers, because the evidence from the UK, the work the Grattan Institute has done, is if you can get our best and brightest to become teachers, then it flows on, it helps our young people, our children, to get better results and set them up for the future as well. Updated at 11.36pm BST 11.21pm BST Labor’s policy announcement today is on education, as Paul Karp reports: High-achieving students who want to become teachers will be given at least $10,000 a year to study education under a Labor plan to improve teacher quality. Under the policy, to be announced on Monday, 5,000 students with an Atar of 80 or more will receive the scholarship to study an education degree, with an extra $2,000 bonus a year for those who teach in a regional area. Labor will aim to double the number of high achievers studying to become teachers over the next decade, from about 1,800 to 3,600 a year. The package will cost $146.5m over four years, and includes an extra 1,500 places in high achieving teachers’ programs. Related: Labor to announce scholarship plan for high-achieving students to become teachers 11.20pm BST On the opinion polls, Jason Clare says: My advice to you, and I know you don’t need it because you know this – is ignore the polls. Treat them with suspicion, they were wrong last time. I suspect they’ll be wrong this time as well. I do think Australians are fed up ... with Scott Morrison and his government. I think they’re sick of the lies and rorts and incompetence. The fact is Scott Morrison can’t visit a whole bunch of Liberal party electorates at the moment because he’s political kryptonite. If he turns up in some of these teal seats, some of his members will keel over and go in the foetal position. He’s got a problem that most Australians have worked him out and don’t want him as prime minister of Australia. But the next two weeks are a big opportunity for us to tell the story about how we can build a better future for all, the whole bunch, of different policies to tackle the sort of problems that Aussies care about. Updated at 11.22pm BST 11.17pm BST Jason Clare says Albanese was 'standing up' to Morrison in debate Jason Clare is continuing his role as the Labor party’s campaign spokesperson, where he has adopted an “everyman” persona to explain things. Here he is on the ABC talking about the debate: One of the things that struck me, was it had all the hallmarks of that first US presidential debate that we saw a couple of years ago with Donald Trump just yelling and being rude. You saw that from Scott Morrison last night. I think that turns people off. All that try-hard bully-boy stuff, might work in the Liberal party, but didn’t work last night. Yes, but Anthony Albanese yelled as well, Clare is told, to which he says: You’ve got to push back. When someone’s trying to bully you or overpower you, you stand up to them. That’s what those did last night. You come back with the facts, you come back with the truth. That’s Scott Morrison’s problem here – you had two leaders going head to head here, one of them had a plan to fix some of the problems that we have in this country, the other just had a pack of excuses which shouldn’t surprise us.

Hopefully not this one, but if the multiverse theory is true, then that universe exists. Today he is worried about Australians being a “vanishing race”. The Katter’s Australian party (KAP) MP says Australians are a vanishing race of people, and we must pull policy levers to encourage people to have families. Double income no kids (DINKS) couples are paying tax at the same rate as families with a stay-at-home wife or husband and three kids. How can anyone consider this to be fair. Income tax splitting should be legalised for families with a single income and children, and prorated down for less deserving situations. The income earner should be able to split their income with the number of people dependant on that income (whether that be their spouse and the number of children they have under 18). ...This policy will encourage people to have children. It is an imperative because otherwise we will vanish as a race of people. I’m saying have one for Mum, one for Dad, one for Australia and one for Bob. The member for Kennedy, Bob Katter.

The Australian Council of Trade Unions had originally asked for a 5% rise but will now ask the Fair Work Commission for 5.5%, less of an ambit claim now inflation is tipped to hit 5.5% by mid year and 6% by year’s end. As runaway inflation has already triggered a mid-election campaign interest rate rise, cost-of-living pressures and wage stagnation have emerged as the most important issues for voters ahead of the 21 May election. Unions have responded by increasing pay demands in the understaffed aged care sector and in state public services, subject to a 2.5% pay rise cap that amounts to a real wage cut. In the minimum wage case, which sets the pay of 2.7m workers, the ACTU is now asking for the hourly rate to rise from $20.33 to $21.45. The ACTU’s earlier claim was lodged in late March, after the Morrison government’s budget predicted inflation would peak at 4.25% mid-year. The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, said “a 5.5% increase is what is now needed just to ensure people tread water, anything less has them drowning in bills”. “Scott Morrison’s government’s submission to the Fair Work Commission is silent on backing a pay increase that keeps up with the cost of living. “Instead it dedicates a whole section to the benefits of low-paid work.” Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) Sally McManus. Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP In the earlier round of submissions, the Australian Industry Group called for a 2% increase, or $15.45 a week to the minimum wage. The Restaurant and Catering Industry Association called for no increase in the minimum wage, arguing take-home pay is already rising due to job shortages, on top of super increases and budget giveaways.

Don’t hype the economic damage, he says, just say we need to “terminate pollution”. It may seem odd to pick the former bodybuilder and actor turned Republican politician as someone with the answer to the most important issue of the 21st century. But Schwarzenegger’s focus on pollution as California’s governor, and that of his successor, the Democrat Jerry Brown, means that since 2008, by wide agreement, the Golden State has enjoyed the longest economic expansion in its history, while also cutting emissions. The contrast with other parts of the world – including much of the US, where climate change is discussed in the gloomiest terms, and usually as a massive cost to businesses and households – is stark. When it comes to debating climate change, the key argument is not “the economy, stupid”, or the decline in biodiversity. The answer is to focus on pollution and its impact on everyone’s health. To illustrate the point, Ipsos Mori found in a poll of public attitudes, timed to coincide with Earth Day last Friday, that concerns about climate change were beaten into eighth place by “not having enough money”, fears of terrorism and the threat of crime. Top of the list, in a poll covering 31 countries and 23,577 adults aged 16 to 74, was the subject “your health and your family’s health”. This suggests that if climate action can be linked to wellbeing, the campaign to reduce emissions is on to a winner. That’s not to say that economics cannot play a role in convincing households that the way we make and sell goods and services needs to change. One important reform would be to the way the state and economists report on the “success” of economic policies, and especially economic growth. The Treasury, the Bank of England and the Office for Budget Responsibility all measure economic success based on growth in the Office for National Statistics’ measure of national income – gross domestic product (GDP). There has always been a problem with a gross measure of national income because it fails to distinguish between useless, and in many cases destructive, activity, and the manufacture and sale of things that benefit society. Critics argue that GDP fails to account for the degradation of the environment caused by economic activity. This month, MPs on the environmental audit committee said greenhouse gas emissions should be published alongside quarterly economic growth figures to help measure the UK’s progress towards net zero goals. In letters to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the UK’s national statistician, Sir Ian Diamond, the committee warned that the narrow scope of GDP means it “fails to acknowledge other indicators such as environmental statistics and social capital”. Cambridge economist Sir Partha Dasgupta says that GDP encourages the pursuit of ‘unsustainable economic growth and development’ This demand signals an advance on previous efforts to create a dashboard of measures that includes biodiversity loss and the degradation of the landscape. Such dashboards can create a blizzard of seemingly contradictory figures, encouraging the Bank, Treasury and OBR to continue focusing on GDP, if only because it remains the most popular shorthand for economic success – if not economic health. More radical is the proposal from the Cambridge economist Sir Partha Dasgupta, who recently reviewed the issue of climate change and policymaking for the Treasury. He said in a report last year that GDP encouraged the pursuit of “unsustainable economic growth and development” by not taking into account the impact on natural assets. Dasgupta has been in talks with the ONS since his report was published to change the way GDP is calculated. Instead of a dashboard, he wants a single “net” measure that takes into account the emissions created to generate growth. Emissions are relatively easy to calculate and there is a vast amount of literature showing how to do it. Net domestic product, or NDP, would then become the basic measure of economic success, because only when the “depreciation of assets” is taken into account can we judge whether we have made progress. On 12 May, when the ONS publishes the latest GDP figures, it will reveal plans “for projects feeding into the creation of a measure of inclusive income”. But when the planet is frying and pollution is increasing, the timetable is likely to be far too slow. Years could pass before there is any tangible reform. The ONS – like the Bank, OBR and Treasury – is a natural follower, not a leader. As if trapped in an episode of Yes, Minister, each asks the other to go first. Maybe they would be under more pressure to junk GDP in favour of NDP if more people accepted Schwarzenegger’s message that emissions create pollution – and pollution is bad for their health.","Id":"business/2022/apr/23/key-to-winning-climate-debate-isnt-economics-its-health","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webTitle":"The key to winning the climate debate isn’t economics: it’s health","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/23/key-to-winning-climate-debate-isnt-economics-its-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/apr/23/key-to-winning-climate-debate-isnt-economics-its-health","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":782,"webPublicationDate":"2022-04-23T16:00:00Z","hosted":false,"id":"business/2022/apr/23/key-to-winning-climate-debate-isnt-economics-its-health"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Macron and Le Pen to face off in crucial live TV election debate","body":"Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen will go head to head in a live TV debate on Wednesday night that could prove crucial in making up the minds of undecided voters four days before the French presidential runoff. The high-stakes, two-and-a-half-hour confrontation, the only direct clash between the two candidates, has been a tradition of French presidential campaigns since 1974, often confirming or dashing electoral ambitions. With recent polls giving Macron a lead of up to 12 points before Sunday’s vote, Le Pen will be keen not to reproduce the poorly prepared, muddled and aggressive performance that sealed her eventual defeat in 2017. Related: Macron v Le Pen: who are the candidates in the French election runoff? “The debate was a failure for which I paid a very heavy price,” Le Pen admitted last month, vowing not to make the same mistakes twice. One of her closest advisers, Philippe Olivier, said she had been “preparing for this moment for five years”. The race is far tighter this year and for Macron, who won by a margin of 66% to 34% five years ago, the greatest danger may be of appearing arrogant – a trait for which he is often criticised – as he attacks what he has termed Le Pen’s “fantasy” policies. “He can’t come across as too technical, too professorial,” said one Macron aide. “Her whole thing is about being on the side of the people; he can’t be dismissive. But he has explain the problems, the inconsistencies, the impossibilities of her programme. It’s a difficult balancing act.” The president also starts at a disadvantage since this time around he has a track record that his challenger will be able to attack. “He’s in a much trickier position – he has something to defend,” said Jean Garrigues, a historian and political scientist. Related: ‘Stop pointing your finger at me!’: 50 years of French election TV debates But Macron faces a rival who has lost momentum as her France-first manifesto – which includes enshrining a “national preference” for jobs, housing and welfare and declaring the primacy of French legislation over international law, bringing France into immediate conflict with the EU – comes under closer scrutiny. Macron can also point to an unemployment rate at a 13-year low and an economy that has outperformed those of other major European countries, and he is likely to confront Le Pen over her past admiration for Vladimir Putin and her plan to ban wearing the hijab in public. For her part, Le Pen will try to present herself as a credible leader and defender of the workers, and portray Macron as belonging to an out-of-touch elite, with possible attack lines including Macron’s controversial plan to raise the retirement age. “Fear is the only argument the current president has to try to stay in power at all costs,” the National Rally leader said in a campaign clip this week, accusing Macron of doom-mongering over a far-right presidency.

The teams have each appointed “consultant producers” who will be in the studio and can intervene if they feel their candidate is being disadvantaged. A mutually acceptable backdrop has been designed, and 2.5 metres set as the distance between the opponents. The studio temperature will be set at 19C. A draw has determined that Le Pen will speak first, and Macron will have the last word. The debate will address eight themes: cost of living; social policy including pensions and healthcare; environment; the economy; education; law and order; immigration; and institutional reform.","Id":"world/2022/apr/20/macron-and-le-pen-face-off-in-crucial-live-tv-election-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Macron and Le Pen to face off in crucial live TV election debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/macron-and-le-pen-face-off-in-crucial-live-tv-election-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/20/macron-and-le-pen-face-off-in-crucial-live-tv-election-debate","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":610,"webPublicationDate":"2022-04-20T10:22:51Z","hosted":false,"id":"world/2022/apr/20/macron-and-le-pen-face-off-in-crucial-live-tv-election-debate"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Labour defends Sunak attack ads as it turns fire on PM’s wife","body":"A senior Labour politician has said the Conservative record on crime and child sexual abuse prosecutions are “legitimate areas for public debate”, as the party released another attack ad focusing on Rishi Sunak’s wife’s former non-dom status. The latest advert, featuring another picture of Sunak, reads: “Do you think it’s right to raise taxes for working people when your family benefited from a tax loophole? Rishi Sunak does.” The advert on Twitter, in the same style as the controversial ads on crime last week, adds: “A Labour government would freeze council tax this year, paid for by a proper windfall tax on oil and gas giants. And we’d scrap the Tories’ non-dom tax loophole.” Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, was revealed last year to hold the special tax status, reportedly saving her millions, but has since said she will pay UK taxes on all her worldwide income.

This week, we’re focusing on the economy, the cost of living, mortgages, council tax, people’s ability to pay their bills, and so on. These are legitimate areas for public debate,” he told Sky News. “And a really important point I come back to underlying it all is that we are not going to accept a political narrative that says every time the Tories change the leader, every year or two, the slate is wiped clean, and nothing that went before counted. “British politics can do better than a new iteration of a Conservative government every couple of years.” The Conservatives dismissed Labour’s latest advert, with one Tory source saying: “This is the height of hypocrisy from a party which has already made £90bn of unfunded spending commitments and whose leader stands to benefit from a bespoke, tax-unregistered pension scheme unavailable to others. “Rishi Sunak has a plan to halve inflation, grow the economy and reduce debt. Sir Keir [Starmer, the Labour leader,] only has a plan – to play politics on Twitter.” Starmer, has defended the tone of the adverts, which have drawn criticism from Labour MPs and discomfort in the shadow cabinet. In a letter to his shadow cabinet, seen by the Guardian, Starmer wrote: “Rishi Sunak is the chief architect of choices prioritising the wealthiest and of the government’s failure to get a grip of the economy and get growth going.” The party’s first digital attack advert of the campaign, published last week, used a picture of Sunak alongside text suggesting he “does not believe adults convicted of sexually assaulting children should go to prison” and pointed to the Tory record on offenders avoiding jail.

Industry insiders expect the sale of Channel 4 to be dropped from the upcoming media bill as the prime minister overhauls policy pledges, according to the Financial Times. “The decision to drop the sale of Channel 4 from the media bill has been signalled by Downing Street to industry and Whitehall,” the report said. Related: All capital spending under review ahead of Jeremy Hunt’s autumn statement Under Boris Johnson, the government drew up plans to privatise the public service broadcaster, which is owned by the state but self-funded through advertising, as part of a wider effort to modernise the sector. Sunak backed the move during his leadership campaign, arguing that Channel 4 needed a commercial owner to help it survive the rise of streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon. He is now believed to be reviewing some of his campaign pledges as the recent market turmoil shifts Downing Street’s economic priorities. Sunak has also faced opposition to the policy from members of his own cabinet. Earlier this year, Jeremy Hunt, now the chancellor, came out against the plans, saying it was important to maintain competition between Channel 4 and the BBC. The environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey, praised Channel 4 at the broadcaster’s 40th anniversary celebrations this week, before leading attenders in a rendition of Happy Birthday. “It’s likely that the government will want to quietly drop privatisation,” one senior Tory told the Financial Times. “It’s unpopular with some parts of the party, has a huge impact on our creative sector and the media bill can be pushed through without including it.” Plans to privatise Channel 4 have been widely criticised amid concerns about the impact on the UK’s independent production sector, which relies heavily on commissions from the youth-focused broadcaster. Channel 4 has previously said a sale would cost the economy £3bn and put many production companies out of business. An industry source reportedly said: “It looks like the government has decided not to go ahead with Channel 4. It makes complete sense. The world and his dog knew it was a political move and there wasn’t really any evidence.” Related: Will Channel 4 bounce back again as it hits its 40th anniversary? Any move to shelve the sale would come as a major boost to Channel 4, which was founded in 1982 and has fended off a number of previous privatisation threats. Ditching the Channel 4 sale would also raise questions about the future of the government’s media bill, which contains measures to ensure the prominence of public service broadcasters on on-demand platforms, and a new code to protect audiences from harmful material. An industry insider said there was a “very good chance it gets pulled” if privatisation was shelved. However, the culture secretary, Michelle Donelan, insisted this week she was going ahead with the bill. A government spokesperson said: “The culture secretary has been clear that we are looking again at the business case for the sale of Channel 4.

Russia’s assault on Ukraine, Biden explained after a tour of the farm’s fields and grain bins, has dramatically reduced food exports from the warring nations that together supply more than a quarter of the world’s wheat, causing food prices to spiral. Related: Biden targets America’s wealthiest with proposed minimum tax on billionaires “Right now, America is fighting on two fronts,” the president said. “At home, it’s inflation and rising prices. Abroad, it’s helping Ukrainians defend their democracy and feeding those who are left hungry around the world because Russian atrocities exist.” With less than six months before the midterm congressional elections, Biden is talking about the economy – a lot. It is the top issue on voters’ minds and, worryingly for Democrats, one of the biggest political liabilities for the president and his party. Despite a streak of steady job growth and low unemployment, Americans are deeply pessimistic about the state of the economy. Inflation, running at nearly its fastest rate in four decades, has become inescapable. Gas prices have surged to record highs as many families struggle to afford the basic necessities like food and rent. Now economists are warning of possible recession. Compounding matters, a shortage of baby formula has left parents in one of the world’s wealthiest countries scrounging to feed their infants. Amid the national tumult over the economy, Biden’s approval ratings have fallen sharply, dipping to the lowest point of his presidency – 39% – this month, according to the latest AP-NORC poll. The visit to the Illinois farm was part of a wider effort by the White House to reset the narrative around the economy after months of unyielding criticism from Republicans, who have used inflation as a political cudgel against Biden. In recent days, Biden has sought to tell a textured story about the economy, one that concludes with the sharp warning that as bleak as it can seem now, the alternative – Republican control of Congress – would be much worse. In his telling, the administration pulled the nation back from the brink of economic catastrophe with a massive stimulus bill and mass vaccination campaign that saved lives and livelihoods during the depths of the pandemic. Two years on, there is much more to do. Naming inflation as his “top domestic priority”, Biden has touted the administration’s efforts to put the economy on a sturdier path by strengthening the nation’s supply chains, cracking down on price gouging and releasing oil from the strategic reserve. Under mounting pressure in recent weeks, he invoked the Defense Production Act to ramp up baby formula production and launched “Operation Fly Formula” to rush shipments into the US from overseas. Gas prices in California surpassed $6.00 a gallon for the first time ever on 18 May. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Yet those actions, he charged, are being undermined by Putin’s aggression in Ukraine, which has sent fuel and food prices soaring; new Covid-19 lockdowns in China that are straining supply chains anew; alleged price-gouging by oil companies; and an “ultra-Maga” Republican party intent on obstructing the president at every turn. Biden says he understands Americans’ frustration with rising costs and the slow pace of progress in Washington – so deeply, in fact, he could “taste” it. But electing Republicans, he argued, would not ease their troubles. “Americans have a choice right now between two paths, reflecting two very different sets of values,” Biden said. He charged that the Republican party, still in the thrall of Donald Trump, had no serious plan to tackle inflation and was instead more focused on fighting issues such as banning textbooks from classrooms. In a press release, the Republican National Committee accused Biden of being “desperate to blame anyone but himself for the worst inflation in 40 years”. “But,” it added, “the American people know he is responsible.” For Democrats who hold narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress, asking voters for two more years of unified government in Washington is a risk that Biden himself acknowledged. Voters historically punish the president’s party in the midterm elections. And this cycle, Democrats have struggled to energize their base, deflated over the party’s failure to pass Biden’s sweeping agenda, designed to remedy longstanding economic challenges. At the same time, Democrats are struggling to persuade independent and moderate Republicans voters who recoiled from Donald Trump in 2018 and 2020. Whether Democrats can change voters’ attitudes on the economy weighs heavily on their prospects. Public opinion surveys have consistently found that voters have more trust in Republicans to handle the economy and inflation than Democrats. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that only 28% of Americans approved of the job Biden was doing to tackle inflation, while 68% disapproved. The same poll showed that 50% of Americans believe Republicans were better able to handle the economy. Just 36% said the same about Democrats. The political headwinds against them, Democrats believe they have found an opening that will undercut Republicans’ advantage. A plan written by Senator Rick Scott of Florida, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, would require all Americans to pay some income tax, including families that don’t earn enough to owe taxes now, and would require Congress to reauthorize all federal legislation every five years. Senator Rick Scott’s plan would require all Americans to pay some income tax, including those that don’t earn enough to owe taxes. Photograph: Tom Brenner/Reuters Biden recently used his bully pulpit to elevate Scott’s 11-Point Plan to Rescue America, which he attacked as an “extreme” vision for the country. Many Republicans, including Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, have distanced themselves from the proposal. Downplaying the disagreement, the White House said it was the only comprehensive plan Republicans have put forward for the midterm elections. “This is not the last you’ve heard from us about chairman Scott’s tax plan that will raise taxes,” Jen Psaki, in her last week as White House press secretary, said. In a withering response, Scott called Biden unfit for office and challenged him to a debate. “Joe Biden can blame me all he wants,” the Florida senator said. “Here’s the truth: he’s the president of the United States, Democrats control the House of Representatives and the Senate. Democrats’ agenda is hurting American families and no amount of spin can change that.” A polling memo by Navigator Research, a Democratic messaging group, underscores why the party is seizing on Scott’s plan. It found that the proposal, when described as a plan that would “raise taxes” on millions of working-class families and potentially threaten entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, was deeply unpopular, even among Republican voters. And when contrasted with the Democrats’ economic agenda, voters’ views of Biden and his party on the economy improved. Isaiah Bailey, an advisor to Navigator Research, said it was incumbent on Democrats to make voters aware of these dueling visions for the country. “Unpopular positions are only politically meaningful when they permeate public consciousness,” Bailey said. He added that Democrats must demonstrate that they are trying to deliver on their promises, even in the face of Republican opposition and procedural challenges like the filibuster. “Democrats really need to look like fighters,” he said. Maria Cardona, a veteran Democratic strategist who has urged her party’s leaders to talk more about the economy with more urgency and empathy, agreed. “For way too long Republicans have gotten away with blaming Democrats, pointing the finger and talking about Biden’s policies,” she said. With so much at stake this fall, including the push to ban abortion if the supreme court overturns Roe v Wade, as is expected, Cardona said it was imperative that Democrats draw a clear contrast with the opposition party. “There’s no question in my mind that we are not taking advantage of the moment in time, when handing over control of Congress to the Republican party is more dangerous for the future of our democracy and for the well-being of our citizenship than it has been in at least a generation,” she said. Surveys suggest that voters broadly understand – and support – the decision to impose sanctions on Russia, even if there are consequences for their pocketbooks. And many cite the ongoing pandemic as a leading cause of the nation’s economic woes. Yet there are signs dissatisfaction with the president’s economic leadership is hardening. “It does not blunt their desire to have you produce a solution,” said Patrick Gaspard, president and chief executive of the Center for American Progress thinktank in Washington. “They’re clear on what the causation is but also clear that they want this president, this Congress, to solve the problem.” A president’s ability to tackle inflation is limited. That power rests largely with the Federal Reserve. Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project and a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution, said there are indications that the president’s efforts to shore up the nation’s supply chains are taking root. One of the best steps the White House can take, she said, is to “not create additional hurdles for monetary policymakers”. “Let monetary policy run its course,” she said, adding that on that front she believes “they’re doing the right things there”. Aiming to cool the economy, the central bank recently approved the sharpest rise in interest rates in more than 20 years. But Jerome Powell, fresh from being confirmed by the Senate for a second term as chair of the Federal Reserve, acknowledged the challenge of attempting to control inflation without tipping the US economy into a recession. Ahead of Biden’s visit to Illinois, the White House received a dash of good news in an otherwise discouraging report: inflation slowed for the first time in months, though the annual rate remained high. But speaking at a fundraiser in Chicago later that day, Biden acknowledged the difficulty of the task ahead. “It’s going to be hard because inflation is going to scare the living hell out of everybody,” he said. “We have a problem we have to deal with. In the meantime, we can’t take our eye off all that could happen if we do not prevail.” David Smith contributed to this report","Id":"us-news/2022/may/23/us-economy-joe-biden-republicans","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"Biden pitches Democrats as saviors for US economy ahead of midterm elections","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/23/us-economy-joe-biden-republicans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/may/23/us-economy-joe-biden-republicans","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":1677,"webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T07:00:11Z","hosted":false,"id":"us-news/2022/may/23/us-economy-joe-biden-republicans"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Russell Brand is the latest to platform climate conservative Bjørn Lomborg’s ‘reckless’ net-zero cost claims","body":"If you like your YouTube content to have plenty of references to global elites, industrial complexes, “freedom” and the conservative conspiracy theory of a “Great Reset”, then the British comedian and actor Russell Brand’s channel might be for you. Brand has more than 6 million subscribers on YouTube and this week his channel turned to the Danish political scientist, Bjørn Lomborg, for a “debate” (not really a debate) on climate change. “I know that polluting the planet cannot be good on a spiritual level and there seems to be significant evidence to suggest that man-made climate change is real,” Brand said. Related: Woodside claims its emissions are falling – but only by using the ‘last resort’ of offsets | Temperature Check During the segment on Brand’s “Stay Free” show, viewed 315,000 times in the four days after it was published, Lomborg argued that renewable energy was too expensive and appeared to try to undermine the role that batteries play in storing renewable energy. The Guardian commentator and environmentalist George Monbiot wrote last week that Brand had seemingly shifted from “challenging injustice to conjuring phantoms”. A charismatic figure who had helped energise young people disillusioned by politics was now wasting his talent on “tired and discredited tales”, Monbiot said. Lomborg has been a regular commentator on climate change and energy in conservative circles for more than a decade. He says climate change is real and caused by humans but its impacts are overblown, the policy responses to it are inefficient and expensive and the world has bigger problems to solve. Lomborg told Brand: “One study in Nature magazine showed the average American by mid-century, if we actually tried to do the [US president Joe] Biden plan to cut emissions to net zero by 2050, would cost in the order of $11,000 per person per year. So it’s not going to happen.” The problem with Lomborg’s argument is the authors of that study have been asking him for 18 months to stop using that figure as they said it was a misrepresentation of the findings, with one saying Lomborg’s continued use of it was “obscenely reckless”. The $11,000 figure was left out of the main study because the authors said the modelling that produced it was not reliable once economies started to cut emissions by more than 80%. Lomborg has rejected their concerns and has continued to use the figure to bolster an argument that net-zero policies will be too expensive to society. Flat battery claims During the interview, Brand asked Lomborg why you couldn’t store solar and wind power for the times when the sun didn’t shine or the wind didn’t blow. “Right now,” Lomborg said, “the world has batteries to store enough electricity for one minutes 15 seconds. By the end of this decade we will have 11 minutes.” The conclusion any observer might reach here is that batteries can’t possibly provide enough cover for renewable energy. Australians have heard this argument deployed by some commentators – and the opposition leader, Peter Dutton – when talking about big battery projects in South Australia and Victoria. But this argument is mostly a strawman. Batteries are not being deployed to provide backup for the whole electricity supply; nor are they the only technology that will allow electricity grids to become almost carbon-free. “It’s a bit like adding up all the world’s supply of chocolate biscuits and then adding [up] the calories that people need and then saying everyone’s going to starve because there aren’t enough biscuits,” says Alison Reeve, a climate change and energy expert at the Grattan Institute. Reeve says batteries help keep electricity grids in balance and they may occasionally have to pick up shortfalls in supply of wind and solar but they will not be alone in that task. She says the use of technologies including biofuels, green hydrogen, pumped hydropower, electricity demand management and a small amount of natural gas are in plans to decarbonise electricity grids while keeping electricity supply affordable and reliable. “I’m not aware of any utility-scale grid anywhere in the world to deploy batteries as the only alternative for [balancing] solar and wind,” she says. Tilting at windmills In an interview with the Sky News host Andrew Bolt, the former deputy prime minister and now Nationals backbencher Barnaby Joyce made a very strong tilt at windmills this week. “Every time you see a wind tower … they try and meme them up as some kind of benevolence … it’s not,” he said. “It’s an abhorrence. It’s intermittent power that forces up the price of your electricity bill.” Energy systems experts have repeatedly outlined how soaring electricity prices in Australia have had nothing to do with the increasing amounts of renewable energy in the market and everything to do with rising gas and coal prices and Russia’s war in Ukraine. Joyce went on to argue the billions being spent on expanding the Snowy hydroelectric scheme (he said the cost had blown out to $20bn but the actual figure is more like $6bn) should instead be spent on upgrading every coal-fired power station in Australia to “high-efficiency low-emission” plants. Related: How the wind blows in Walcha: a community divided over renewable energy These would “belt massive amounts of power on to our grid, forcing down the price of power”, Joyce claimed. The problem with that power is that it is more expensive than solar and wind and is still incredibly bad for the climate. A UN report in 2021 looked at the full lifecycle emissions of different electricity generation technologies. The “cleanest” coal plant still emitted 751g CO2 a kilowatt hour, compared with about 8g each for the cleanest wind and solar electricity. Joyce’s logic here is interesting. Spending money on Snowy Hydro 2.0 to store cleaner and cheaper energy = bad. Spending the same money to refurbish ageing coal fleets to pump out dirty and expensive power = good.","Id":"environment/2023/mar/16/russell-brand-is-the-latest-to-platform-climate-conservative-bjrn-lomborgs-reckless-net-zero-cost-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webTitle":"Russell Brand is the latest to platform climate conservative Bjørn Lomborg’s ‘reckless’ net-zero cost claims | Temperature Check","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/16/russell-brand-is-the-latest-to-platform-climate-conservative-bjrn-lomborgs-reckless-net-zero-cost-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/16/russell-brand-is-the-latest-to-platform-climate-conservative-bjrn-lomborgs-reckless-net-zero-cost-claims","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":949,"webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T23:00:10Z","hosted":false,"id":"environment/2023/mar/16/russell-brand-is-the-latest-to-platform-climate-conservative-bjrn-lomborgs-reckless-net-zero-cost-claims"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"BTS members to do military service in South Korea","body":"The seven members of BTS – one of the world’s biggest bands – will perform military service in their native South Korea, their agency has said, ending a long national debate over whether they should receive an exemption. While many fans of the K-pop sensations were hoping the band members would be given special consideration due to their contribution to the South Korean economy and international prestige, the artists will each serve almost two years in the military. Jin, the oldest member of the group, will be the first to swap his stage outfit for a uniform soon after he turns 30 in December, media reports said. The six other members, born between 1993 and 1997, will follow suit, with the band expected to reform in about 2025, according to their management company, Big Hit Music. Big Hit, part of BTS’s agency Hybe, said on Monday the band’s members were “moving forward with plans to fulfil their military service”, adding that “as each individual embarks on solo endeavours, it’s the perfect time and the members of BTS are honoured to serve”. “Group member Jin will initiate the process as soon as his schedule for his solo release is concluded at the end of October,” it added in a statement. “Other members of the group plan to carry out their military service based on their own individual plans.” All able-bodied South Korean men under the age of 30 must serve in the military for between 18 and 21 months – a duty intended to maintain the country’s ability to defend against a possible attack by North Korea, with which it is technically still at war. Some prominent South Koreans have received exemptions or have been allowed to perform alternative public service, including Olympic and Asian Games medal winners and prize-winning classical musicians and dancers. They include Seong-jin Cho, the first Korean pianist to win the International Chopin Piano Competition, and the Tottenham footballer Son Heung-min, a gold medalist at the 2018 Asian Games. Some South Korean MPs had voiced support for an exemption, despite concerns that it would invite accusations of favouritism, not least among other young men who have no choice but to serve. Refusing to complete military service is a crime in South Korea, and can lead to imprisonment and social stigma, as the actor and singer Steve Yoo discovered when he was deported and banned from entering the country after he avoided conscription by becoming a naturalised US citizen in 2002, months before he was due to be drafted. Earlier this month, Lee Ki-sik, commissioner of the military manpower administration, told MPs it would be “desirable” for members of the band to carry out their military duties to ensure fairness in the country’s military service. The decision comes months after BTS announced they were taking a break as a group to concentrate on solo careers. The band reunited to perform a free concert on Saturday in Busan in support of the port city’s campaign to host the 2030 World Exposition. The award-winning group have sold more than 30m albums worldwide and picked up two Grammy nominations on their way to reaching the top of the US and UK charts.","Id":"music/2022/oct/17/bts-k-pop-members-military-service-south-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"BTS members to do military service in South Korea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/17/bts-k-pop-members-military-service-south-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/oct/17/bts-k-pop-members-military-service-south-korea","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts","wordcount":529,"webPublicationDate":"2022-10-17T10:03:57Z","hosted":false,"id":"music/2022/oct/17/bts-k-pop-members-military-service-south-korea"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese clash over cost of living and integrity in messy leaders’ debate","body":"Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese have bickered over electricity prices, national security and a federal integrity commission in the second leaders’ debate of the election campaign. Ahead of early voting opening on Monday, the prime minister appealed for Australians to stick with certainty, while the Labor leader said the country could not afford three more years of the Coalition. Facing questions from a panel of three journalists from the Nine network, the most heated moment of the night was when the two leaders argued about Chinese influence in the region. Morrison was asked to explain his remark that a Chinese base in Solomon Islands would be viewed as a “red line” by the Australian government, to which he said it would be “unwise” to speculate. “It means that was something Australia believes would be completely against our national interest, and we also believe it will be against the Solomon Islands’ national interest,” Morrison said. Related: ‘I am who I am’: Anthony Albanese rushes towards his date with destiny After Morrison challenged Albanese on why Labor had cut defence spending, Albanese raised the sale of the Port of Darwin to a company linked to the Chinese Communist party. “When I was a minister, we put US marines into Darwin. When you have been a minister, we’ve had the port of Darwin sold to a company connected with the Chinese Communist party. You ticked it off.” Morrison accused Albanese of telling “this lie for some time”, saying the federal government had no authority over the sale of territory assets. The two men then argued, with Morrison accusing Albanese of being unable to stand up to China when the “loudest” pro-Beijing voices came from within the Labor party. “How often has Richard Marles met with the Chinese ambassador in Australia? He is your deputy leader,” Morrison asked. “That is an outrageous slur,” Albanese said. Another fiery moment came when the two disagreed over how Labor’s pledge to transition the electricity grid might affect power prices. Morrison asked how much more Labor would spend on transmission, saying it would be recovered from the consumers and lead to price rises: “That’s how it works.” Albanese said there “is not an energy economist in the country that agrees with you”. After talking about party unity on the issue of net zero by 2050, Albanese accused Morrison of being unable to commit to a higher near-term target because “Barnaby Joyce won’t let you make the target higher”. Morrison said he did not think a higher target than a 26% to 28% cut on 2005 levels by 2035 was good policy, despite the likelihood of reaching that level. “I think it is the wrong policy. I don’t want to put up people’s electricity prices.” The scene in Nine’s Sydney studios. Photograph: Getty Images The debate kicked off with the two leaders challenged on cost-of-living pressures, asked what they could do about the $5 cost of lettuce. Morrison pointed to the measures announced in the budget, including the cut to fuel excise and tax cuts. “We cannot control all the forces that are coming from overseas, but what we can do, by managing money well, that puts downward pressure on inflation.” Albanese said his party had policies designed to achieve cheaper childcare and cheaper medicines, that were “aimed at growing the economy in a way that doesn’t put additional pressure on inflation”. “The cost of living measures that [Morrison] spoke about are all temporary, they have all the sincerity of a fake tan, they disappear once people have cast their vote and people are then back on their own again.” Both ruled out an extension of the cut to fuel excise, which ends in September. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On industrial relations, Albanese was asked to guarantee that wage prices would outstrip inflation if he formed government, prompting the Labor leader to promise wages would be higher than under the Coalition. “Our objective is to have real wage increases and we have practical plans to do that,” he said. On the economy, Morrison defended the forecast debt in the budget, saying the pandemic had required the government to spend more, and borrow to do so. “In the pandemic we had to lean in and save the economy through jobkeeper, the single largest economic intervention which saved lives, livelihoods and businesses and that expenditure ensured the Australian economy could be where it is today,” Morrison said. When asked how young Australians would pay the debt off, Morrison said they would be in work. “They will have jobs in an economy coming out of this pandemic stronger than any other advanced economy in the world.” Albanese was asked about what Labor was doing for young Australians “dealing with rising rents, out of reach house prices [and] student debt”. “Young people are doing it really tough, no doubt about that,” he said. The Labor leader said he was promising increased investment in social housing and a plan for 10,000 affordable housing units for essential workers. On an integrity commission, the two leaders were asked if they had seen corruption in their parties and what they had done about it. Morrison said he had not seen any corruption in the Liberal party over the past three years, and when asked about New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption findings regarding developer donations said he had no knowledge of the issue. “You are assuming I have some knowledge or awareness or involvement in those issues, which I clearly do not.” But Morrison said he still believed there was a need for a federal integrity commission, pointing to the government’s draft bill that has stalled in the parliament. Albanese acknowledged there had been corruption within NSW Labor, but said “there was a stench” around Canberra that needed to be addressed. “I think overwhelmingly, people go into politics across the spectrum for all the right reasons. They go in to take their view about how they help their fellow Australians in the best way possible. But the truth is, there is a stench around Canberra at the moment.” Morrison then challenged Albanese over the party’s lack of draft legislation for such a commission, which Labor has promised to introduce this year. Related: ‘The director of his own show’: the PM mingles with middle Australia “Given he is so passionate about this, why haven’t you drafted your own legislation for such a commission? You have had three years. You have two pages. “You’ve been hiding in the bushes.” Albanese said Labor would release legislation this year. “Our democracy is precious ... we need to make sure that Australians can have faith in it and that is why we need to do whatever we can to create institutions and structures that enhance that faith in our political system.” Morrison and Albanese were also asked about the government’s pandemic management, with the prime minister acknowledging he should not have said the vaccine rollout was not a race. “It was a race, Anthony, and we shouldn’t have described it in those terms,” Morrison said. In his closing remarks, Morrison said the choice at the election would “impact significantly on the future of all Australians.” “We are a known quantity, and at a time of great uncertainty, now is not the time to risk things on the unknown. “Labor have no plan, they are unknown, and a small target is always a big risk.” Albanese said Australia had the opportunity for a “better government”. “With a better government, we can be an even better country into the future. And I will say this – there are four words you will never hear from me. words you will never hear from me: ‘That’s not my job.’ I will never say it. “If I get the job, I will do the job each and every day.” Channel Nine’s “viewer verdict” initially had Morrison the winner, then Albanese, before the result came in at a 50-50 tie.","Id":"australia-news/2022/may/08/scott-morrison-and-anthony-albanese-clash-over-cost-of-living-and-integrity-in-messy-leaders-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese clash over cost of living and integrity in messy leaders’ debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/08/scott-morrison-and-anthony-albanese-clash-over-cost-of-living-and-integrity-in-messy-leaders-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/may/08/scott-morrison-and-anthony-albanese-clash-over-cost-of-living-and-integrity-in-messy-leaders-debate","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":1297,"webPublicationDate":"2022-05-08T13:04:13Z","hosted":false,"id":"australia-news/2022/may/08/scott-morrison-and-anthony-albanese-clash-over-cost-of-living-and-integrity-in-messy-leaders-debate"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"TV debate between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss called off after presenter faints – as it happened","body":"7.36pm BST Evening summary The second one-to-one televised debate between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, organised by TalkTV and the Sun, was halted midway after the presenter, TalkTV’s political editor Kate McCann, fainted on the set. She is now fine, TalkTV says. Truss, the foreign secretary and favourite in the Tory leadership contest, said in the debate that the tax rises implemented by Sunak as chancellor were “morally wrong”. She said: What has happened is that the tax has been raised on families through national insurance so that they are having to pay more money to the Treasury. I do think it is morally wrong at this moment when families are struggling to pay for food that we have put up taxes on ordinary people when we said we wouldn’t in our manifesto and when we didn’t need to do so. In response, Sunak said it was morally wrong to raise borrowing, which would have to be paid off by future generations. He said: What’s morally wrong is asking our children and grandchildren to pick up the tab for the bills that we are not prepared to meet. Truss said that she would use general taxation to fill the gap in NHS funding left by her plan to reverse Sunak’s national insurance increase, which funded the health and social care levy. She said: I am committed to the extra money that was announced for the NHS. It is needed to deal with the backlog and I would fund that money out of general taxation. Truss suggested earlier in the day that Sunak’s economic policies would be a “disaster” for Britain. (See 3.59pm.) A YouGov poll of Tory members suggests they thought Truss comfortably won last night’s BBC debate. In the poll she was seen as outperforming Sunak on every measure, except who looked most prime ministerial, where Sunak was just one point ahead. (See 1.13pm.) Boris Johnson has told MPs that no government business was discussed “as far as I am aware” when he met the former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev at an Italian palazzo without officials present when he was foreign secretary.

And whether Sunak has the guts to stand up to Vladimir Putin if he turns off the gas taps this winter. Yes, says Sunak. He says: Yes, Andrew, is the quick answer and the reason you can believe me is because as chancellor I did a couple of things that demonstrates that strength. A year and a half ago I made sure that our armed forces got the largest uplift in funding that they’ve had since the end of the Cold War to make sure that we’re protected against threats like Putin. As chancellor I also worked with all my finance ministers around the world to put in place a sanctions package, the likes of which we had never seen, to try and tighten the grip on Putin’s war machine, stop funding going to him and it does require toughness to stand up to him and it is going to require all of us to go through some difficult times. McCann asks Truss how she will keep people supporting her when the cost of standing up to Putin is immense. Truss says the cost of not standing up to him would be worse. He would go on. Something has crashed on set. It sounds as though something has collapsed. The broadcast has stopped. Truss looked shocked. Updated at 8.12pm BST 6.30pm BST Truss and Sunak both say they support fracking, if local communities are in favour. And they both say they will keep the fuel duty cuts already in place. Updated at 8.10pm BST 6.29pm BST Truss says Sunak’s policies are making the UK less competitive. If you raise corporation tax too high, you get less money into the exchequer, she says. She says we are projected to have the lowest growth in the G7. That is about jobs, she says. Sunak says Sun readers are sensible enough to know that you do not get something for nothing. So the question is - how do you pay for things? He thinks it is reasonable to ask big companies to pay more, he says. He says he has spent his life in business. Of course he cares about competitiveness. The key thing is to get firms to invest. So he will cut taxes for businesses that invest in the economy. 6.27pm BST Truss says Sunak's tax rises were 'morally wrong' The next question from a woman who asks if her family should go vegetarian. She talks about the cost of meat. Truss says she would cut red tape for farmers and focus on food production. She also wants resilience in the food supply. She says she is the proud representative of a rural constituency. They produce good meat, she says. Q: But often it is not affordable? That is why she wants to help farmers produce food more cheaply. She would do that by cutting regulation for farmers. Sunak says lots of families are facing rising bills. He hopes the questioner will be getting some of the support already on offer. He wants to get inflation out of the system, so the problems do not get worse, he says. He says supermarkets should be held to account. He represents a rural area with many farmers. The supermarkets should not be exploiting the farmers, he says. He wants supply chains to be fair. Shops should not be passing on price increases that are not right. Truss says she wants to tackle inflation too. The Bank of England thinks it will fall. On food bills, she says she wants to ensure people keep more of their own money. It is “morally wrong” to put up taxes for ordinary people when it is not necessary, and when the Tory manifesto said the party would not do that. Sunak says what is “morally wrong” is asking our children and grandchildren to pick up the bills we are not prepared to meet now. He says it is fair to ask companies to pay a bit more through corporation tax. They received a lot of help during the pandemic. Truss wants to cut taxes for big business, he says. Truss says that is a misrepresentation. (She wants to scrap a planned rise.) Updated at 8.10pm BST 6.20pm BST Asked about their experience of the NHS, Sunak says his grandfather has just come out of hospital, and his daughter has needed A&E treatment. Truss says she has called 111 recently, and had a good experience, and her daughter has received treatment recently. 6.18pm BST Truss says she will use general taxation to fill the gap in NHS funding left when she scraps national insurance rise McCann puts it to Sunak that money on its own has not worked. Sunak says technology offers big potential too, like blood screening technology. He says he would like to see more specialised hubs where surgeons can work very effectively. Using innovations will address the backlogs. He says he has published a plan saying from day one tackling the NHS backlog will be his number one priority. McCann asks Truss where the extra money for the NHS will come from if she scraps the health and social care levy. Truss says she is committed to the extra money for the NHS already promised. She would fund it from general taxation, she says. She is committed to the 40 new hospitals the government has agreed to build. (Except, of course, they aren’t new hospitals.) She says she wants to give more doctors on the frontline freedom to deliver. Updated at 8.08pm BST 6.14pm BST Sunak stresses funding, Truss decentralisation, as candidates quizzed on NHS John Hughes from Birmingham asks a question. He was diagnosed with cancer. He has had to rely on a charity for help, he says. He has had no help from cancer nurses. Why is the NHS broken? Sunak says he grew up in an NHS family. He knows what a difference healthcare can make. The NHS is under strain because it is recovering from Covid. It is under pressure. People are waiting for care. He made sure the NHS got the funding it needed, through the national insurance rise. That was not easy and he got criticised for it. But it was the right thing to do, he says. That is why people can be reassured the NHS is safe in his hands, he says. Truss says she is incredibly sorry to hear about John’s experience. She says her mum worked as a nurse in cancer research. She says there is too much micro-managing in the NHS. People should not be directing everything from Whitehall. She wants to give more power locally. Updated at 8.07pm BST 6.09pm BST Kate McCann says, since they are both Sun readers, they can ask the first questions. (Hardly typical Sun readers, though.) Truss goes first. She says the green levy has put extra money on people’s bills. What would he do on day one to cut costs for people? Sunak says he was going to ask Truss how she is spending her birthday, since it is her birthday. He says, as chancellor, one of the last things he did was put in place support for people with energy bills. The most vulnerable people will get £1,200. If costs are going to go even higher, of course he would come back and do more. That is what he has done. But Truss wants to borrow more, he says. That puts money on the nation’s credit card. Truss says she has had a great birthday. The issue is anaemic growth, she says. We have the lowest growth projected in the G7. She says higher taxes will increase the chances of a recession.

As PM she will put money back in people’s pockets from day one. It is wrong the tax burden is the highest it has been for 70 years. She says she is someone who does what she says. She has delivered on Brexit, on trade deals and on standing up to Vladimir Putin. She will run a government of all talents, she says. 6.04pm BST Rishi Sunak starts. He says the challenges we face are immense. But there are opportunities too, not least because of Brexit, which he was proud to vote for, he says (remininding us, by implication, Liz Truss didn’t). 6.03pm BST TalkTV/Sun Tory leadership debate starts The debate is starting.

She asks Victoria Newton, editor in chief of the Sun, what her readers want to hear from the candidates. Newton says first of all they are interested in the cost of living. But they also want to hear about immigration and Brexit, she claims. She says Sun readers tends to be floating voters. That is why politicians care about what they think.

Related: Labour pledges to fast-track rape and domestic violence cases through courts 5.04pm BST Questions from readers answered Here are answers to some of the questions people have submitted through our experimental widget. Truss and Sunak’s spending plans Am I correct in thinking that neither candidate for PM have said anything about their spending priorities, let alone how that reconcile their proposed tax cuts with the increasing demand to provide even basic government services? They have talked about spending plans a bit - but mainly to promise extra spending (on defence, for example, or for the Border Force). The IFS says Truss’s plans would almost certainly have to involve cuts in public spending but - beyond a hint from one of her supporters that existing government spending plans are not set in stone - she has not addressed this point properly at all. If you want a list of all their polices, Public First has a good tracker here. What will happen to the loser? Hi Andrew, SJ here. I thought it was interesting that both Liz and Rishi said they would offer one another cabinet positions. I struggle to imagine a world though, where either of them would offer one of the big offices of state and it is also difficult to believe they would accept a less-prestigious cabinet position. What do you see being the most likely scenario with the losing candidate? Cabinet position? Backbench grandee? Or even leaving politics altogether (more likely in Rishi’s case than with Liz). Thanks! The normal procedure in these circumstances is to offer a rival such a junior post that they feel obliged to return to the backbenches. This is what Boris Johnson did in 2019, when he offered Jeremy Hunt demotion from foreign secretary to defence secretary. Hunt said no. But given that the two candidates disagree so fundamentally on the economy, the winner might not even bother and might just exclude the other one from their government altogether. It may also depend on the size of the victory margin. After winning 65%/35%, Truss would feel much more confident despatching Sunak to the wilderness than after a 55%/45% victory. How will the winner move on? How will the winning candidate for PM manage to unite the Tory Party once they have won? How will the new PM be able to then switch to a more moderate tone to try and win the next election ? More easily than you think. At the moment Truss is making a lot of rightwing announcements because she needs to win over a rightwing audience. Once the focus changes (assuming she wins - but the same principle would be true for Sunak), and she needs to focus on the parliamentary party and the electorate at large, she will change her tone. (It is not as if she hasn’t had any practice.) Number of debates Hi Andrew all these debates in the Tory leadership contest seem to be complete overkill especially since most people have no vote. It also seems that there are more of these debates than for previous such contests - is this correct? Where there any for the 2020 Labour leadership contest? I haven’t done a count, but I think we are getting at least as many debates and hustings as in 2019. It is just that you have forgotten most of them because quite quickly they become very repetitive. And there were plenty of Labour events in early 2020 too, until Covid closed them down. Privileges committee Hi Andrew - how likely is it that the Privileges Committee find Boris Johnson has broken the ministerial code, and that he is subsequently is suspended and faces a recall petition? And how likely is it, in addition, that he is recalled and faces a byelection?| The committee is not specifically investigating whether Johnson broke the ministerial code - a matter for government, not parliament - but if it were to find that Johnson did deliberately mislead parliament, that would amount to a finding that the ministerial code had been broken. I think it is already clear that the committee will conclude that MPs were misled by what Johnson said, and that this amounts to a contempt of parliament. Johnson has admitted himself that he passed on duff information. Whether or not they conclude he lied is less clear. They will want a conclusion that the committee supports unanimously, and that is likely to be accepted by the Commons as a whole, and so they may find it hard to justify a conclusion saying bluntly: “He lied.” But they might; they seem very serious about gathering evidence. At the very least I expect the committee to say Johnson was cavalier about MPs being misled, and that this was unaccepable. Will they recommend a suspension of at least 10 days (which could trigger recall)? I don’t know. But any punishment would have to be put to the Commons for a vote, and I think Harriet Harman will want a report that receives widespread backing from MPs, not a split along party lines. If Johnson does get suspended for 10 days, campaigners would have to get 10% of voters in his constituency to sign a petition for a recall election to take place. I guess that would be easily done. One other possibility - the new prime minister could ask MPs to vote to halt the privileges committee inquiry. That would be hugely controversial, because it would be another example of Tory MPs voting to protect one of their own. But Liz Truss may feel that a row about that is preferrable to six months’ of stories about the former party leader being a liar. It would be the equivalent of Gerald Ford granting Richard Nixon a pardon in 1976. Scottish independence Hi Andrew, do you think a Conservative or Labour government will ever allow a second Scottish Independence Referendum? If so, under what circumstances do you think they would concede one?||||If not, does that present a constitutional crisis since the power technically exists to hold one, but it’s being withheld regardless of the case for it? It is definitely possible at some point in the future. Note, for example, how Rishi Sunak is saying today that a second referendum is “the wrong priority at the worst possible moment” - not that it should never happen. By 2030 the argument that the 2014 was meant to settle matters for a generation will not have much grip. And if public support for independence in Scotland were to start regularly reaching 55/60%, then at that point I think Westminster would have to respond. Race and the leadership contest Why is the issue of race not being mentioned? Everyone knows that there is a core of the Tory membership that will never vote for a non-white individual as their leader. Sunak is too weak to challenge such individuals and Truss seems content to simply hoover up the votes of such individuals. The Rwanda policy, which even Tom Tugendhat supports, shows how anti-foreigner views are being chased after and not confronted. You’re right. There has been little media discussion of whether Sunak not being white is a problem for his chances. But mostly, I think, that reflects a media consensus that race is not a significant factor at all in the contest (and that going on about it might actually reinforce prejudice). The Conservative party has changed enormously over the past decade, and the line-up in the early stages of the contest - which was easily the most diverse of any leadership contest for any major party in UK history - ought to show that ethnicity does not stop people succeeding right at the top of politics anymore. It is also the case that it is impossible to tell whether ethnicity affects people’s chances of getting elected in a contest like this. There is some evidence for the impact it has in a general election, and that does show that Conservative-leaning voters are slightly less inclined to vote for a non-white candidate. But the impact is marginal (and not enough to make one think it would be a decisive factor in the Truss v Sunak contest). This is what the evidence says according to The British General Election of 2019, the definitive study of the contest. As at other recent elections, felding [an ethnic minority] candidate appears to have made a difference to the vote secured by Conservative candidates, but not by their Labour counterparts. Where the Conservatives felded an ethnic minority candidate in 2019 after not having done so in 2017, their vote fell on average by −1.2 points. In contrast, Conservative support increased by +2.1 points where either a white candidate or an ethnic minority candidate was felded on both occasions. This discrepancy cannot be accounted for by the incumbency status of the candidate or the ethnic composition of the constituency, while it is apparent in both Leave and Remain seats. What is more, where the Conservative candidate in 2019 was white but the previous candidate was from a minority background in 2017, the average rise in the Conservative vote was, at +2.8 points, a little higher than elsewhere. The relatively socially conservative character of Conservative support still appears to be refected in a reluctance by a few of the party’s potential voters to back a more ethnically diverse parliamentary party. Updated at 10.42am BST 3.59pm BST Truss suggests Sunak's economic policies would be 'disaster' for Britain Liz Truss, the foreign secretary and Tory leadership contest, has been giving an interview for Sky News during a campaign event in Sussex. Judging by what she said about Rishi Sunak’s tax policies, any hope that the campaign rhetoric may be softening is for the birds. Here are the main points. Truss suggested that Sunak’s economic policies would be a “disaster” for the UK. Asked about today’s IMF world economic update, which implies it would be wrong to cut taxes now, she replied: Let’s be clear, [Sunak’s] plan is to raise taxes. He is planning to raise taxes on corporations, putting our taxes up to the same level as France. That is going to put off people who want to invest in Britain. And I know there are masses of opportunities right across the country. Less investment will mean fewer jobs, fewer opportunities, lower wages and lower productivity in the future. So it’s cutting off our nose to spite our face. The fact is that we promised in our manifesto not to raise national insurance. I thought it was wrong at the time to do so, and that is why I would reverse that. I also want to put money into people’s pockets. I could quote the OECD who said that our current policy is contractionary. And what that means is it will lead to a recession. A recession would be a disaster, it would be a disaster for people who are homeowners. It would be a disaster for people who go out to work. It would be a disaster for people who run businesses. That is why I want to keep taxes low, attract the investment, get the growth. That’s the best way to pay down our debt. She dismissed the fact that there is little support amongst mainstream economists for her own economic policies. She said: I don’t base my policies on the number of economists... The question is who is right. The fact is we are one of the few G7 countries that are putting up taxes. Countries like the United States, Canada, Japan have higher levels of debt than us. They are not putting up taxes because they understand that now is the time we need to get the economic growth into our economy to avoid a recession and to make sure that we are attracting business investment and those jobs and growth for the future. She said she was fed up of hearing “declinist talk” about Britain’s economic prospects. She refused to respond to claims that some of her supporters, like Nadine Dorries, were engaging in unedifying attacks on Sunak. Asked specifically about Dorries, she just said she had a “fantastic range of supporters”. She ducked a question about whether she got annoyed by the constant interruptions from Sunak in the debate last night. “I put my case across,” she said. And she refused to say whether she thought he was “mansplaining”. When asked about that, she replied: “I’m putting forward a positive case”. She restated her threat to make it harder for unions to organise strikes, saying she would take “a tough line on trade union action that is not helping people get on in life”. And she said she would ignore union threats to mobilise to block her strike reform plans. Asked about Mick Lynch, the RMT leader, saying she would face mass resistance (see 3.10pm), she replied: I don’t take any notice of these bellicose threats. I’m on the side of the travelling public who need to get into work to do their jobs. Liz Truss on Sky News.

Related: IMF slashes global growth forecast as top three economies ‘stall’ 3.10pm BST Unite leader says Truss's 'madcap' plans for unions are 'attempt to outlaw strike action' Overnight Liz Truss, the foreign secretary and favourite in the Tory leadership contest, announced plans that she said would “prevent trade unions from paralysing the country”. They would significantly curtail the ability of trade unions to use strike action as a means of protecting their members’ interests. According to her news release, she would: “Introduce minimum service levels on critical national infrastructure - introducing primary legislation in the first 30 days of government.” “Ensure strike action has significant support from union members by raising the minimum threshold for voting in favour of strike action from 40% to 50%, and expanding this rule across all sectors.” “Increase the minimum notice period for strike action from two weeks to four weeks.” “Implement a cooling off period so that unions can no longer strike as many times as they like in the six month period after a ballot.” “Put an end to members receiving tax free payments from trade unions on the days they are striking.” As my colleague Jessica Elgot reports in her story on this, Mick Lynch, general secretary of the RMT, has said the proposals would amount to “the biggest attack on trade union and civil rights since labour unions were legalised in 1871”. He said unions would fight them with mass resistance. Related: Liz Truss pledges crackdown on unions but is accused of ‘Tory fantasy’ Sharon Graham, general secretary of the Unite union, has this afternoon released a similar statement, saying Truss will be met by “fierce, prolonged resistance” if she tries to push through these changes. Graham said: Let’s be clear Liz Truss’s madcap proposals are an attempt to outlaw strike action and effective trade unions. This so-called manifesto is a declaration of war on the trade union movement and working people. In effect, it is a charter for massive social discontent. What we have here is an ambitious politician, hawking for the votes of a tiny minority by putting the rights of all workers on the chopping block. At the time of a cost of living crisis, where profiteering not wages is driving inflation, this would-be prime minister has instead chosen to return Britain’s workplaces to the 19th century. It’s Charles Dickens meets 2022. Unite will not bow to threats and bullying and any attempt to make our fight for jobs, pay and conditions illegal will be met with fierce, prolonged resistance.

This is from Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader. Boris Johnson has finally admitted to meeting a former KGB agent while Foreign Secretary in the wake of an attack on British soil and after a crucial NATO summit but this mealy-mouthed statement raises more questions than it answers. Keeping the British people safe should be a priority of government, but this web of murky relationships shows the Conservatives cannot be trusted with our national security ... This letter suggests the prime minister has something to hide. He has failed to answer whether a private phone call with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov had been arranged or explain the presence of an undeclared and unidentified guest. As foreign secretary, Boris Johnson’s carelessness with words put people in danger. Every day he clings to office, there is new evidence of the risk to national security he poses. 2.32pm BST You will notice a new feature on the blog: a panel allowing you to ping a question or a comment directly to me.

Hearing from readers and responding to points they raise has always been an important feature of this blog, and one that makes the journalism better, and so we are trying this feature just to see if it works better. Updated at 2.39pm BST 2.19pm BST Johnson claims meeting with ex KGB agent Lebedev not pre-arranged, and no official business discussed 'as far as I'm aware' Boris Johnson has given his fullest public account to date of how he met the former KGB agent and Russian oligarch Alexander Lebedev at a private party in Italy in April 2018, when Johnson was foreign secretary. The party was hosted by Lebedev’s son, Evgeny Lebedev, a friend of Johnson’s who has subsequently been given a peerage. Johnson attended the event without the security detail that normally accompanied him as foreign secretary and, although his presence at the event with Alexander Lebedev was first reported in 2019, questions have persisted about what Johnson was up to, and whether it was appropriate. Recently Paul Caruana Galizia from Tortoise reported that Lebedev had arranged for Johnson to take a call from the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, while he was at the party, without government officials monitoring it, but that the call never happened – purportedly because Johnson overslept. Scoop: in April 2018, Alexander Lebedev set up an unmonitored line between Boris Johnson, then foreign secretary, and Sergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, to discuss the Salisbury poisonings. But the call never happened because... https://t.co/RXDih3ZcrJ — Paul Caruana Galizia (@pcaruanagalizia) June 16, 2022 At a hearing with the Commons liaison committee earlier this month, Johnson admitted for the first time that he had met Alexander Lebedev at the party. The committee had various follow-up questions and, in a letter to it released today, Johnson has addressed them. Here are the key points. Johnson defends his decision not to take his security detail with him to the Lebedev party. He says: Officials were aware in advance that I was attending the social event. Contrary to some reports, my visit was in line with established security protocols under successive foreign secretaries. It would not have been normal practice for civil servants or security staff to have accompanied me to such a private, social occasion. I did not take ministerial papers with me. He says that, as far as he is aware, he did not discuss official business with Lebedev. If he had discussed official business at a meeting like this – a social occasion where officials were not present – he would have had to report back any “significant content” to the department afterwards. He goes on: “That was not necessary in this case. As far as I am aware, no government business was discussed.” The qualifier “as far as I am aware” may be significant, and my colleague Dan Sabbagh offered one potential explanation for Johnson’s lack of awareness on this point in a story he wrote earlier this month. Dan said: On the Saturday night, Johnson is understood to have got heavily drunk at the event, meaning that it was unlikely that much of substance was discussed between the newspaper owner and the then foreign secretary. Johnson says his meeting with Alexander Lebedev at the party “was not a formal meeting, nor something that was pre-arranged”. Johnson implies that his contacts with Evgeny Lebedev were no more inappropriate than Labour’s. He says it was Lord Mandelson, when he was business secretary, who allowed the Lebedevs to buy the Evening Standard in 2009. And he says the shadow cabinet had “considerable engagement” with Evgeny Lebedev in the period until 2016, when it used to disclose details of meetings with senior media figures. Since then, Labour has stopped publishing information about these meetings, “despite a commitment following the Leveson inquiry”, Johnson says. Alexander Lebedev with his son Evgeny Lebedev (right).

Updated at 5.09pm BST 1.27pm BST SNP accuses Sunak of using 'warped logic' to justify opposing second independence referendum The SNP has accused Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor and Tory leadership candidate, of using “warped logic” to justify his decision to oppose allowing a second independence referendum. In a response to Sunak’s column in the Scottish Daily Mail (see 10.56am), Kirsten Oswald, the party’s deputy leader at Westminster, said: Rishi Sunak’s warped logic appears to be that the people of Scotland cannot be given a say over their constitutional future because the UK is in such a mess. It is precisely because the UK is lagging behind neighbouring countries on a range of wealth and equality indicators – as demonstrated in the recent Scottish government paper – that independence for Scotland is essential. The longer Scotland remains tied to a failing Westminster system, the poorer we will become as a result. The Tories put the exact case that Rishi Sunak is making to the people of Scotland at every election, and they lose every election by a landslide. It’s clear that neither of the Tory candidates have put any thought into their Scotland strategy, which does not bode well for either of them becoming prime minister. Kirsten Oswald.

I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Rachel Hall. I’ll be here for the rest of the day, including covering the TalkTV/Sun Tory leadership debate at 6pm. And talking of debates, here is more on the YouGov poll of Tory members who watched last night’s BBC debate. The results are good for Liz Truss - in fact, so good for her that (unless the Tory members being sampled by YouGov are seriously unrepresentative of the acting voting membership, which seems unlikely) it is increasingly hard to see how Rishi Sunak wins. Conservative members think Truss performed best by 50% to 39%, the poll suggests. Our snap poll of 507 Tory party members who watched last night's BBC debate shows that Truss is seen as having performed best Liz Truss: 50% Rishi Sunak: 39%https://t.co/UHictqetge pic.twitter.com/nIOyvrS5RF — YouGov (@YouGov) July 26, 2022 Truss was deemed to have performed better than Sunak on all eight debate topics covered by the poll, the findings suggest. (See 12.04pm.) Truss also came across as more in touch with ordinary people, likeable and trustworthy.

Truss came across as more in touch and trustworthy in the debate, according to Tory members In touch with ordinary people Truss 63% / Sunak 19% Likeable Truss 54% / Sunak 35% Trustworthy Truss 51% / Sunak 37% Prime Ministerial Truss 42% / Sunak 43%https://t.co/UHictqetge pic.twitter.com/eTfjC7HBwv — YouGov (@YouGov) July 26, 2022 Although debates can change perceptions of a candidate, more often they don’t, and more often debating polling just reflects what people thought of the candidates before the debate took place. In broad terms, that seems to be the case with this poll. Last week a YouGov poll of Tory members had Truss leading Sunak by 62% to 38%. Today’s poll results suggest Sunak may have outperformed the baseline - ie, he scored better than expected given that the audience (Tory members) favoured Truss in the first place - but not by enough to overcome his initial handicap. Updated at 7.38pm BST 12.34pm BST The UK has imposed sanctions on Sarvar and Sanjar Ismailov, nephews of Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov, who has close ties to the Kremlin. Sarvar Ismailov was previously a director at Everton Football Club and both have significant interests in the UK, the Foreign Office said. The leaders of the Moscow-backed breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine have also been hit with sanctions. Foreign secretary Liz Truss said: We will not keep quiet and watch Kremlin-appointed state actors suppress the people of Ukraine or the freedoms of their own people. We will continue to impose harsh sanctions on those who are trying to legitimise [Vladimir] Putin’s illegal invasion until Ukraine prevails. Updated at 1.30pm BST 12.04pm BST Polling from YouGov suggests that Liz Truss was perceived by Tory members to have outperformed Sunak on every issue covered in last night’s debate. In particular, she led on Ukraine, cost of living and levelling up, although her lead was weaker on Brexit, the environment and taxation.

He told reporters: There’s this balance to be struck between having a vigorous debate and being sort of almost too polite to each other. I think it’s inevitable that you’re going to have candidates disagreeing, and frankly, we need to hear what the arguments are. We shouldn’t shy away from robust debate, which is what we’re getting. I think it’s refreshing and good. Updated at 12.18pm BST 11.00am BST The government has blocked any “non-essential” new payments from the overseas aid budget for the rest of the summer over concerns the cost of relief work in Ukraine will breach a spending cap. The FT reports: Last year, Boris Johnson’s government cut Britain’s overseas aid budget after the Covid-19 pandemic, “temporarily” ditching a Conservative party manifesto commitment to spend 0.7% of gross domestic product and replacing it with a new 0.5% limit. Treasury chief secretary Simon Clarke last week told the Foreign Office and other departments to suspend “non-essential aid spending” until Johnson’s replacement as prime minister was in post because the new lower limit was about to be breached. Andrew Mitchell, a former Tory international development secretary, said the move would “undoubtedly cost lives” in some of the world’s poorest countries. The Treasury decision stunned UK officials working on development projects, who claimed programmes would be halted, dealing a fresh blow to Britain’s claim to be an “aid superpower”. One British aid official said: “The vast majority of UK development programmes will simply stop. This is truly awful. It will breach contracts, and goes against everything the UK claims to stand for.” Updated at 1.30pm BST 10.56am BST Wrong time for second Scottish independence referendum, says Sunak A second Scottish independence referendum is “the wrong priority at the worst possible moment”, Tory leadership candidate Rishi Sunak has written in a column for the Scottish Daily Mail on Tuesday. Both he and rival Liz Truss have spoken out against the idea of holding another vote, with Truss stating last week that she would not agree to a request from the Scottish Government under any circumstances. First minister Nicola Sturgeon last week branded the two hopefuls “hypocrites” in response to their comments. In his column, Sunak said the United Kingdom is the “most successful political union in history, and has stood the test of time in withstanding some of the greatest challenges we have ever faced”. He wrote: Working together and uniting is what made us such a formidable force on the world stage. Scotland has achieved so much as part of the UK, and the UK has achieved so much because of Scotland. We can build on that success for the future, and I have a plan to do it. In the same way that the might of our union stepped up to help people in all corners of the UK during the pandemic, it’s going to have to help people through the immediate months and challenges ahead. I am clear that another referendum is the wrong priority at the worst possible moment. The SNP are wrong to try and tear the country apart when we should be pulling together. Why aren’t they talking about the drugs crisis in Scotland or how we can get more money into Scottish workers’ pockets? Just as I want to be more accountable to people in every corner of the United Kingdom, so too does the SNP need to be more accountable for their responsibilities. The Tory MP added that the UK government cannot “just stop a referendum, we also need to drive down support for independence, too”. He said: We need to win the argument and show that you can be a patriotic Scot and a proud advocate of our United Kingdom at the same time. One is not exclusive to the other. To do so, the former chancellor suggested Westminster should put an end to the “devolve and forget mentality” and instead become “the most active UK government since devolution began” by investing more funding directly into local communities. Updated at 10.57am BST 10.27am BST The polling firm Ipsos has published its index for July, showing that public concern about inflation is mounting, with 45% of respondents citing it as a big issue for the country – the highest score since the early 1980s. One in three say the economy is a big issue for Britain, up from a quarter at the start of the year.

The Labour leader distanced himself from his own pledge when he was running for the party’s leadership in 2019 to support “common ownership of rail, mail, energy and water”. He told BBC Breakfast: We’ve got to recognise that after the pandemic we’re in a different situation financially to the situation that we were in before, and we want a responsible government that says if we’re going to do something we will tell you how we’re going to pay for it. The single most important thing is how we grow the economy, re-energise the economy, and that can’t be reduced to a discussion about nationalisation. Starmer stressed his “pragmatic” approach, saying that for most utilities “the answer is going to lie in regulating the market, changing the market, rather than simply taking things into public ownership”. However, he said Labour would stick to plans to nationalise the railways if it won the next election. Updated at 12.42pm BST 9.55am BST Social care workers need to be “better paid and more highly regarded” rather than earning less than dog walkers, according to the former deputy prime minister Damian Green, writing in a report from by the centre-right thinktank Public Policy Projects (PPP). Green called for the minimum wage for care workers to be increased in line with NHS pay and said there needed to be a shift in public opinion similar to the boost in status that nurses received following the work of Florence Nightingale during the Crimean war. Green, who served as deputy prime minister under Theresa May, said: We need more care workers, we need them to stay longer in their jobs, and we need them to be better paid and more highly regarded. The report, published by centre-right think tank Public Policy Projects (PPP), comes as the Conservative leadership debate focuses on tax cuts. Leadership candidate Liz Truss has promised to scrap the increase in national insurance brought in to help pay for the NHS and social care. The Conservative MP Chris Skidmore, who is also PPP’s research director and is backing Truss’s rival Rishi Sunak, said the report “demonstrates comprehensively why the government was right to introduce the health and social care levy last year”.

He told Sky News it is not linked to Truss’s tax plans, adding that she does not agree with Sunak that her proposals will result in the base interest rate being pushed up to 7%. Clarke said: I think it’s really important to say that two targeted interventions on tax – the first are in terms of reversing the national insurance rise of a few weeks ago, and then cancelling an increase in corporation tax that isn’t even in effect yet, it’s due to come into effect next spring – there’s no evidence I can see that that would be inflationary. I think it’s instead about supporting jobs and families at a time when we know there is a lot of hardship out there, we know the tax burden is really very high. He said it is “absolutely critical” that people get behind Truss’s vision for a pro-growth strategy “because that is what the country needs”. Updated at 10.32am BST 9.27am BST Tory leadership candidates Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak clash in fierce TV debate Good morning. Last night Tory leadership candidates Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak clashed in a fierce TV debate over tax cuts, China and inflation. This morning, politicians have been sharing their views. One of Truss’ supporters, Simon Clarke, chief secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News there had been “aggressive moments”, while conceding that the overall tenor had been “respectful”. He added: I think there were some pretty aggressive moments at the outset from Rishi towards Liz in terms of interrupting her as she tried to set out her case, but by and large I think the debate was held in a reasonable spirit reflecting, obviously, the importance of the issues. Labour leader Keir Starmer’s appraisal to BBC Breakfast was more damning: I watched as much as I could bear of it, because it showed just the two contenders taking lumps out of each other, talking over each other, talking about clothing and earrings instead of the health service. So if ever there was an example of a party that is absolutely lost the plot, lost any sense of purpose then it was that debate last night. Meanwhile, MP David Davis dismissed the suggestion that Rishi Sunak was “mansplaining” to Liz Truss as “spin”. He told Sky News: “Sometimes it’s important to intervene in debates.” You can read the Guardian’s chief political correspondent Jess Elgot’s full report of the debates here: Related: Rishi Sunak ‘aggressive’ in Tory leadership debate, say Truss’ supporters Here’s what’s on the agenda for today: 18:00 Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak will face questions from Sun readers on the Sun website and TalkTV.

As pressure builds on global regulators to increase their scrutiny of the technology, the Competition and Markets Authority said it would look at the underlying systems, or foundation models, behind AI tools such as ChatGPT. The initial review, described by one legal expert as a “pre-warning” to the sector, will publish its findings in September. In the US, the vice-president, Kamala Harris, has invited the chief executives of the leading AI firms ChatGPT, Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet to the White House on Thursday to discuss how to deal with the safety concerns around the technology. The Federal Trade Commission, which oversees competition in the US, has signalled it is also watching closely, saying this week its staff were “focusing intensely” on how companies might choose to use AI technology, in ways that could have “actual and substantial impact on consumers”. Meanwhile, the Italian data watchdog lifted a temporary ban on ChatGPT last week after OpenAI addressed concerns over data use and privacy. The government’s outgoing scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, has urged ministers to “get ahead” of the profound social and economic changes that could be triggered by AI, saying the impact on jobs could be as big as that of the Industrial Revolution. On Monday, the boss of the computing firm IBM revealed he expected to pause hiring in roles that could be replaced by AI in the coming years, saying as many as a third of the company’s non-customer facing jobs – about 7,800 roles – could be affected. The disruption has spread to stock markets, with hundreds of millions of pounds wiped from the share price of the UK education company Pearson this week, after Chegg, a US provider of online help to students for writing and maths assignments, revised its financial forecasts and said ChatGPT was affecting customer growth. The CMA chief executive, Sarah Cardell, said AI had the potential to “transform” the way businesses and consumers competed, but that consumers must be protected. “AI has burst into the public consciousness over the past few months but has been on our radar for some time,” said Cardell. “It’s crucial that the potential benefits of this transformative technology are readily accessible to UK businesses and consumers while people remain protected from issues like false or misleading information.” ChatGPT and Google’s rival Bard service are prone to delivering false information in response to users’ prompts, while the anti-misinformation outfit NewsGuard said this week that chatbots pretending to be journalists were running almost 50 AI-generated “content farms”. The CMA review will look at how the markets for foundation models could evolve, what opportunities and risks there are for consumers and competition, and formulate “guiding principles” to support competition and protect consumers. The major players in AI are Microsoft, OpenAI – in which Microsoft is an investor – and Alphabet, which owns a world-leading AI business in UK-based DeepMind, while leading AI startups include Anthropic and Stability AI, the British company behind Stable Diffusion. The announcement of an initial review was a “pre-warning” to firms developing AI models, said Alex Haffner, competition partner at the UK law firm Fladgate. “Given the direction of regulatory travel at the moment and the fact the CMA is deciding to dedicate resource to this area, its announcement must be seen as some form of pre-warning about aggressive development of AI programmes without due scrutiny being applied.” The watchdog has been asked by ministers to consider how the development and use of AI can be supported against five principles: safety, transparency, fairness, accountability, and the ability of newcomers to challenge established players in AI. Verity Egerton-Doyle, the UK co-head of technology at Linklaters law firm, said the CMA had seen an opportunity to “lead the global debate on these issues”. “It is not surprising the CMA has decided to look at AI,” she said. “It has been known for some time that the CMA is keen to skill up and understand what role there is for competition law in this important new area”.","Id":"technology/2023/may/04/uk-competition-watchdog-launches-review-ai-market-artificial-intelligence","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webTitle":"UK competition watchdog launches review of AI market","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/04/uk-competition-watchdog-launches-review-ai-market-artificial-intelligence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/may/04/uk-competition-watchdog-launches-review-ai-market-artificial-intelligence","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":707,"webPublicationDate":"2023-05-04T13:14:28Z","hosted":false,"id":"technology/2023/may/04/uk-competition-watchdog-launches-review-ai-market-artificial-intelligence"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Labour cannot be Tory-lite at the next election: voters crave a real choice","body":"There is much that is true in Larry Elliott’s appraisal (Brexit, the environment, energy bills … it’s hard to tell Labour and Tory policies apart, 1 June). What is beyond doubt is that Keir Starmer’s Labour and the Tories have moved to positions and policies that very few people, other than mega-rich, rightwing media moguls, agree on. The latest polls show that Brexit has failed, with consequences far worse than the most pessimistic of us feared. The botched and detrimental privatisation of public utilities, the obscenity that is “outsourcing”, the creeping ruin of our NHS, and the desperate conditions of people in the private rented sector are not being addressed by either party. We expect the Tories to be heartless wreckers, but who on earth does Starmer think he is appealing to? This consensus of despair and futility is not a good thing for Britain. Martin Coult London • When the two major parties are too close for comfort, it discourages any real debate on economic policy. When both parties agree the priority is to reduce the budget deficit, it means a commitment to continued austerity and wage restraint in the public sector. Do voters really want a continuation of the situation where schools and hospitals remain underfunded and are haemorrhaging staff? Why is the option of better funding for both not a priority for Labour? Both parties seem committed to retaining the light-touch regulation of privatised utilities, leaving the water companies free to continue polluting our waterways. Both are committed to leaving private sector wealth untouched by tax, so denying government the resources necessary to finance a radical rebuilding of the economy. What appears to mainstream Westminster thinking as realist economic policymaking, elsewhere appears as anything but. It’s a ducking of the major and contentious issues that should dominate Westminster debate. Doesn’t this tired acceptance of things as they are suggest that time is up for these two parties, if all they can offer is a stifling of debate on those matters that are of most concern to voters? Derrick Joad Leeds • Larry Elliott’s logic is inescapable. There is a growing consensus between Labour and some Tories on economic issues. What a sad and inadequate offering to a public experiencing increasing poverty and alienation, a climate crisis and the threat of AI. A reworking of the economics of the past will not cut it. We need radical economic visionaries who will put the needs of people and planet at the centre. Lyn A Dade London • Larry Elliott’s claim that it is difficult to tell current Tory and Labour policies apart is unconvincing. Unless, that is, he is arguing that the Tories, like Labour, are also committed to achieving 100% clean energy by 2030; the complete cessation of further oil and gas extraction; the ending of privatised rail franchises as they expire; an extension of basic employment rights from day one including banning zero-hours contracts; the creation of a national social care service; the abolition of non-dom status and investing revenue from doing so in lower energy costs; renegotiating and improving the Brexit deal; abolishing the House of Lords; new devolved powers to the regions; and reinvestment in public services?

Income tax, interest rates, inflation and most people’s wages: all were deliberately suppressed by Downing Street and its collaborators in business and the Bank of England. By doing so a space was created – in theory at least – for certain interest groups to flourish: employers, entrepreneurs, shareholders, top earners, homeowners and consumers. Together, they were supposed to boost our previously sluggish rate of economic growth. It hasn’t quite worked out like that. Britain is on the brink of recession yet again. Interest rates, taxes and inflation are all high. Only average wages are still low. And even that dubious achievement of British government and capitalism since the 1980s now feels fragile, with strikes solidifying and spreading across both private and state sectors, determinedly driven by workers who have finally had enough of years of falling pay. As Mick Lynch of the RMT union put it with characteristic pithiness on the Today programme last week: “The price of labour isn’t at the right price in this country.” What might life be like in Britain if most people’s wages were more generous? One answer is more like life in many other rich countries. According to the United Nations, the share of our gross domestic product that goes to employees is lower than in France, Germany, Italy, Australia, South Korea, Canada, the US and half a dozen other, often more successful, capitalist nations. This “labour share” has fallen in Britain in most years since the late 1970s, when the great counterattack began against unions and decent pay for the many. The absence of this broad-brush but telling indicator from everyday debate in Britain is a sign of how much our politics is shaped by essentially rightwing assumptions. Related: UK labour market heads for turning point as pay growth nears peak But now the national conversation about pay seems to be changing. Lynch says the strikes – which despite months of disruption still have substantial public support – are ultimately about “the rebalancing of our society”. That’s a very ambitious goal for a union movement much smaller than in its 1970s heyday; which receives at best qualified support from Labour; and which faces a cornered Tory government that sees a successful confrontation with the unions as one of the few ways it might stay in power. Yet the cost of living crisis, and crippling staff shortages from the NHS to the railways, mean that the old Westminster and media orthodoxy that holding down pay is Britain’s only realistic option is losing its force. Were salaries generally higher, it would almost certainly be easier to recruit and retain staff. Some of the large number of adults who have chosen to leave the national workforce in recent years would probably return. Workers might be more motivated and efficient, lessening Britain’s productivity crisis. Some employees would be able to work fewer hours, and families might benefit as a result. With higher disposable incomes, people would probably spend more, boosting the British economy. Meanwhile the state would need to spend less on benefits that effectively subsidise low wages. According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, two thirds of working-age adults in poverty are in a household where someone works. Higher wages could make having a job a real – rather than often rhetorical – route out of poverty. Realigning the economy with the needs of the majority would also have costs. Taxes or state borrowing would have to rise to fund better public sector wages – at least in the short term, until the in-work benefits bill fell, and rising incomes increased growth. Goods and services might also become more expensive. We have got used to a world where almost anything can be delivered cheaply to our door – and almost anything can be done to us at work. In a higher-wage world, we might lose some of our power as consumers, while gaining power as workers. At first, we might feel the loss of familiar pleasures more than we use this new agency. But inflation has already begun to end the golden age of consumption for most of us, anyway. And higher wages may also bring more welcome disruptions. The gap between ordinary and elite earners, which has opened even further in Britain than most wealthy countries, might narrow – especially if taxes are raised to increase public sector pay. Such a narrowing could have psychological as well as material consequences. The extreme separateness and sense of entitlement of the modern rich, and the queasy mix of fascination and loathing rich people arouse in us, evident in hit TV shows such as Succession and The White Lotus, might diminish a little if economic security was not so unfairly distributed. Now, some or all of these potential shifts may sound far-fetched. But an economy where most people’s wages grew rather than shrank has existed before in Britain. For much of the first three decades of the 20th century, and again from the late 1940s until the mid-1970s, the “labour share” increased. In fact, its trajectory over the past 150 years forms a wave pattern, with slumps regularly followed by recoveries. Another upswing is overdue. It may be harder to achieve this time. During previous pay upswings, the economy and trade union memberships were often growing strongly, unlike now. Today’s workers will have to be canny and relentless to get more, when the rewards provided by capitalism may be shrinking overall for some time. But the survival, instead, of the low-wage status quo feels increasingly uncertain. In 1962, one of the most influential modern economists wrote that “in a market society” the way that pay is distributed “is unlikely to be tolerated unless it is also regarded as yielding distributive justice”. Without a broad public acceptance of such economic arrangements, he went on, “no society can be stable”. The economist was Milton Friedman, one of the gurus of the global right. With Britain in such a state now that even he and Mick Lynch might agree on a few things, were Friedman still alive, the end of our low-wage era may be coming.

Related: Liberal MP may support Labor censure of Scott Morrison over secret ministries scandal The gag, introduced by the Abbott government in 2014, prevented legal aid centres at the coalface of social issues including welfare, family violence, housing and consumer law from seeking law reform, including specialist domestic violence and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services. Before 2014 the national legal assistance partnership stated that federal funding did not restrict the right of organisations “to enter into public debate or criticism of the commonwealth, its agencies, employees, servants or agents”. In a statement Dreyfus said the Albanese government “is ending this political censorship and restoring independence and free speech to the community legal sector”.

Dreyfus said this would “ease the administrative and bureaucratic burden” allowing providers to “focus on doing what they do best – providing much-needed frontline legal assistance services”. In the October budget the government gave $13.5m over three years from 2022–23 for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services and $12m over four years from 2022–23 to community legal centres in New South Wales and Queensland to assist fire- and flood-affected individuals. Community legal centres have welcomed the investment but insist more will be needed in future budgets to deal with overwhelming community need. In June the assistant minister for charities and Treasury, Andrew Leigh, told Guardian Australia that Labor would look to remove gag clauses in future agreements with charities, and would direct the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, the sector’s regulator, not to enforce those conditions in existing agreements. “We need to hear from the anti-poverty charity on social reforms,” Leigh said. “We need the wisdom of environmental charities in designing climate and environment policies.

Tax day came and went this week without lawmakers reaching an agreement on lifting the debt ceiling, the US government’s borrowing limit to cover all of its financial obligations. Experts have warned that failure to lift or suspend the debt ceiling could have catastrophic consequences for the US economy, which would be felt in every American household. After months of stalled negotiations, the Republican House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, attempted to kickstart talks with the White House on Wednesday by outlining his proposal to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for government spending cuts that would curtail implementation of Joe Biden’s landmark climate and healthcare legislation. But that proposal may not be able to pass the House, given Republicans’ narrow majority. Even if the bill does make it through the House, the proposal has already been rejected by Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate majority leader. With the calendar inching closer to June, when a default could occur, the path forward on raising the debt ceiling remains deeply unclear. McCarthy’s 320-page debt ceiling bill proposed lifting the government’s borrowing limit into 2024 in exchange for a number of rightwing policy concessions. If the bill were adopted, the federal government’s budget would be rolled back to fiscal year 2022 levels and limited to 1% annual growth for the next decade. McCarthy has also called for repealing portions of the Inflation Reduction Act, the signature bill Biden signed last year, and blocking the president’s plan to cancel up to $20,000 in student debt, which is currently tangled up in the courts. In a speech delivered at the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, McCarthy previewed his bill and called for fiscal restraint, lamenting the federal government’s ballooning debt. “Without exaggeration, America’s debt is a ticking time bomb that will detonate unless we take serious, responsible action,” McCarthy said. “Yet rather than working with Republicans to find a reasonable agreement to tame inflation and provide certainty to the economy, President Biden is demanding that Congress make room for new debt without a single, sensible change to how government spends your hard-earned money.” Biden responded to McCarthy’s proposal with a scoff, dismissing Republicans’ debt limit bill as a set of “wacko notions” that would harm working Americans. “It’s not about fiscal discipline. It’s about cutting benefits for folks that … they don’t seem to care much about,” Biden said on Wednesday at a union hall in Maryland. “It’s about finding ways to squeeze out more of America’s middle class.” Jean Ross, a senior fellow on inclusive economy at the liberal thinktank Center for American Progress, described McCarthy’s bill as “a radical wishlist of Republican demands in exchange for what would be an 11-month, at most, increase in the debt ceiling”. The proposed spending caps “would be incredibly deep and touch every element of government from air traffic control, food and water safety, childcare”, Ross said. “It’s easy to talk in these sort of abstract, top-line numbers about a budget cap, but when it really comes down to what does that mean, this isn’t a serious proposal.” Gordon Gray, director of fiscal policy at the center-right thinktank American Action Forum, framed McCarthy’s proposal as an “opening bid” to ignite negotiations. “Of course Democrats aren’t going to buy all of what Kevin McCarthy’s selling, but it’s an opening bid,” Gray said. “You have to have an opening bid to get follow on bids. So it’s good to get the ball rolling.” Chuck Schumer has already rejected Kevin McCarthy’s proposal. Photograph: Amanda Andrade-Rhoades/Reuters So far, Democrats have shown no interest in negotiating over the debt ceiling. As Biden denounced Republicans’ proposal on Wednesday, he reiterated his call for a “clean” debt ceiling bill, meaning one that increased the government’s borrowing limit without any strings attached. In a Senate floor speech on Tuesday, Schumer argued this was not the appropriate time or forum to argue over government spending. Noting that Democrats and Republicans worked in a bipartisan fashion to repeatedly address the debt ceiling during Donald Trump’s presidency, Schumer drew a clear distinction between covering bills already accrued by the government and changing spending habits moving forward. “Nobody is saying that there cannot be a conversation about what kind of cuts Republicans want, but it doesn’t belong in this debate – plain and simple,” Schumer said. “It belongs in discussions over the budget that Congress has every year, and not as a precondition to avoiding default.” But McCarthy has already ruled out the possibility of supporting a clean debt ceiling bill. With Republicans in control of the House, they have the power to block a clean bill from moving forward. “I think it is worthwhile for the White House to hear and understand that their preferred outcome doesn’t have the votes,” Gray said. “It may be inconvenient. The White House may resent the hell out of the fact that Republicans hold the House. I get it, but it’s a reality.” However, it remains unclear whether McCarthy even has the votes in the House to pass his bill. Some hardline conservatives have voiced skepticism of the proposal, calling for more stringent Medicaid work requirements and even questioning whether the debt limit needs to be raised at all. “My position is that you don’t have to raise the debt ceiling if you bring your spending under control,” congressman Andy Biggs, a far-right Republican from Arizona, told HuffPost on Tuesday. McCarthy can only afford to lose four Republican votes and still pass his bill, assuming all Democrats oppose the legislation. Biden may be counting on division within the House Republican conference to sink McCarthy’s bill and force the speaker’s hand on supporting a clean debt ceiling increase. “I don’t think that’s an unreasonable perceived advantage from elected Democrats right now,” Gray said. “That is a very precarious bet though because the stakes are so high.” If the country does default on its debt, experts warn that the catastrophic consequences would touch every corner of the American economy. “Financial markets would crash.

It’s too late, he said. It’s Tuesday. Tomorrow’s Wednesday. It’s too late. In less befuddling news: Labor leader Anthony Albanese says a Labor government would support a 5.1% wage increase. Prime minister Scott Morrison has made false claims about gender confirmation surgery while supporting Warringah candidate Katherine Deves, who backtracked on an initial apology. Labor’s Michael Gunner, the Northern Territory’s chief minister, has quit. Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce will send his preferences One Nation’s way. They’ve changed, he says.

Updated at 11.23am BST 10.58am BST Retired Sydney nanny Adriana Rivas faces extradition to Chile on charges of kidnapping From AAP: Retired Sydney nanny, Adriana Rivas, faces extradition to Chile where she is wanted on kidnapping charges dating back to Augusto Pinochet’s military dictatorship in the 1970s, after a court closed her final appeal option. Rivas had appealed to the High Court after three Federal Court judges in November unanimously rejected her appeal against extradition to her homeland. But the High Court issued a certificate on Monday saying her appeal application was deemed to have been abandoned because of unspecified procedural failings by her lawyer. Rivas has waged a three-year battle against extradition on charges that she kidnapped seven people in 1976 and 1977, including Communist Party leader, Victor Diaz, and party member Reinalda Pereira, who was five months’ pregnant. Rivas was an assistant to Manuel Contreras, the head of the Dina secret police during Pinochet’s dictatorship. Rivas denies ever meeting the alleged victims, who have never been found. Rivas’ lawyers have argued she was not a Dina agent and her work was mundane. The extradition must be approved by Australia’s attorney general with a decision likely to be made after the 21 May election. Updated at 11.10am BST 10.53am BST Q: Does the reckless spending have to stop? Albanese says Labor’s measures will grow the economy – Tingle points out that’s what the government says, that it’ll grow the pie without imposing restraints on spending. He says: We will inherit $1tn of debt, that is why we are being very careful about our spending commitment and making sure they’re prioritised to things like making more things here, powering Australia, childcare, better infrastructure and the NBN. Tingle asks about his scope for negotiating with a potential crossbench on climate change and an integrity bill. He says a government he leads will propose an integrity bill – “one that has serious powers”, that he is confident independents will support. He won’t commit to a more ambitious emissions reduction target. “This is a chance to end the climate wars,” he says. We have seen with the floods and the bushfires, the challenge is here right now. The issues are there right now, which is why we will act. Anthony Albanese at the Surrey Hills Level Crossing removal project on Day 30 of the 2022 federal election campaign, in Melbourne. Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP Updated at 11.02am BST 10.49am BST Childcare “is not welfare”, Albanese says. “It is about growing the economy.” He says the “distortion” in the system that stops women working more days needs to go to get a growth in productivity: It is good for equality, but it is also good for the entire economy, women and men, if we get the economy growing more strongly, if we get more productivity bonuses and it also is good for those businesses to have those permanent workers as well as being good for closing the gap that is there in the retirement incomes of women. Updated at 10.56am BST 10.47am BST Albanese: we need to prevent a 'race to the bottom' on wages People on the minimum wage shouldn’t fall further behind, Albanese says, and the government should make a submission to the Fair Work Commission saying it supports a wage increase for people in the aged care sector. And: We need to have enterprise bargaining work effectively so productivity drives those wages and profit increases at the same time. We have a win/win. But we also need structural changes. We will make secure work an objective of the act. We will also make achieving pay equity for women an objective of the act as well. We need to prevent a “race to the bottom”, Albanese says, where there’s a race for subcontractors to undercut each other (and presumably recoup money by paying people less). Updated at 10.57am BST 10.45am BST Albanese says the government “deliberately” wanted to keep wages low, while he “deliberately” wants them to increase. There are a “range of measures” to do that, he says: What you need to do to increase wages, at the same time as you increase profits, is to increase productivity. I spoke to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry just last week about this. I will convene a full employment summit that brings unions and business together to talk about how we get wages moving, how we get business going, grow the economy in a way that the economy works for people just not the other way around. There are a number of other specific measures that can happen as well. 10.38am BST Labor leader Anthony Albanese is about to talk to the ABC’s Laura Tingle.

Updated at 9.22am BST 8.54am BST Nuclear safety “must be part of our DNA” as Australia acquires nuclear-powered submarines, according to the head of the submarine taskforce, Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead. Addressing the Royal Australian Navy’s sea power conference in Sydney today, Mead said the plan to acquire at least eight nuclear-propelled submarines “does represent a substantial capability leap for Royal Australian Navy and will allow Australia to become a far more capable partner in the Indo-Pacific region”. But Mead - who is working with the US and the UK on an 18-month study into how it can be done - also said the task ahead was “very significant”. Mead was at pains to reassure all partners about Australia’s commitment to nuclear non-proliferation (a point that has been a concern to countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia): To be clear, I am talking about nuclear propulsion technology: Australia is not [seeking] and will not seek nuclear weapons. Mead said Australia must demonstrate “an unwavering commitment to safe and secure stewardship of nuclear propulsion technology”: This commitment, this nuclear mindset, must be part of our DNA … Our mindset must reflect an unwavering commitment to safely and securely stewarding nuclear propulsion technology from cradle to grave. This nuclear mindset must permeate the culture of the entire Australian nuclear-powered submarine enterprise. It must manifest in every day to day activity now and into the future, whether an individual is working in our supply chain, a welder in the shipyard or personnel working in the operational headquarters. This is the work we are progressing - it is not just about the platform we will acquire. Mead went on to say the Australian public must demand such standards: I expect, I demand that the Australian public will hold the defence force [and] the task force to the absolute high standards of safety and security when it comes to nuclear-propulsion technology, as they must, and that we must achieve the gold standard on safety and security all the way through. And we must do that before we go forward in the very final phases of the programme. I see safety and security underpinning everything we do. Mead also mentioned the “deteriorating strategic circumstances” which led to Australia’s decision to pursue a nuclear-powered submarine capability. He said 2020 Australian defence strategic update highlighted how military modernisation in the Indo-Pacific was occurring at an unprecedented rate.

In this country, gender reassignment surgery is not available to adolescents and is only available to people over the age of 18. Is the prime minister misleading people? Is this an issue?” Robert says it’s a “sensitive topic” and he thinks there may have been court decisions that allowed people under 18 to access surgery. “A conversation is trying to be had,” he says: Seek first to understand before being understood.

Is it true? Please explain, Antoun Issa, Alex Healey and Gabrielle Jackson: 6.49am BST If you’re in parts of Queensland facing record rains for May, you probably don’t need much confirmation that weather has gone a bit haywire just now. Towns like Innisfail have reported more than 120mm of rain since 9am. There are also warnings of dangerous and life-threatening flooding in some areas with 200mm deluges within six hours possible, the Bureau of Meteorology says. Meteorologists have been waiting for the La Niña conditions in the Pacific – which favour above-average rain in eastern Australia (and elsewhere) – to break down for a while. By some measures, we haven’t seen a La Niña linger this long for a couple of decades. The latest weekly Nino 3.4 sea surface temperature anomaly is -1.2°C, the coldest May weekly anomaly in this region since 2000. #LaNina continues to be quite robust.

As it happens, conditions off the north-west coast of Western Australia are also tilting towards wetter-than-usual weather which can reach all the way across the continent to the southeast. It’s the time of year when models typically have the lowest accuracy, but even so, the prospects of a so-called negative phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole are looking quite strong: Meanwhile, Indian Ocean conditions remain tilted towards negative-phase of the IO Dipole (that favours a wetter than usual winter, spring in Australia's southeast.

That’s certainly a decision for government, but I have to be ready with a force of well-trained men and women and high-end capabilities. And so I stand ready to respond to any tasking that the government [would assign] for our navy to undertake. Noonan was asked about the potential use of undersea drones. He said that would be “a great step forward in terms of getting a greater understanding about how we operate in a robotic undersea environment”. He said he expected to see “crewed and uncrewed systems working together” and “ultimately developing undersea warfare tactics that allow us to have a better understanding of the domain that we’re working in, and how we can exploit that”. Noonan added: Certainly, as we look to the future, we would expect to see between 250 and 300 submarines operating in our immediate region. So I want to have the best possible understanding I can of the undersea environment in which we operate. A quick note: this figure looks alarming on the face of it, but it is not new. For example, the then defence minister, Linda Reynolds, said in a speech in late 2020: Across the Indo-Pacific, other nations are investing in, and expanding, their submarine fleets. And also their anti-submarine warfare capabilities. By 2030, it is estimated that over half of the world’s submarines will be operating in our region: over 300. (It certainly puts into sharp relief the regional context for Australia’s planned acquisition of “at least eight” nuclear-powered submarines in coming decades.) 6.13am BST Next stop for Labor leader Anthony Albanese is (drum roll): The media pack travelling with Labor leader Anthony Albanese has landed in Sydney. https://t.co/7VukLZCVxv — Tom McIlroy (@TomMcIlroy) May 10, 2022 6.00am BST Katharine Murphy’s word magic: There has been well-founded disgust for some weeks about Morrison’s performative punching down on a vulnerable community just to generate a slice of campaign outrage sufficiently potent to cut through the noise of a contested election.

Patrick is seeking the release of archived cabinet documents setting out Australia’s strategy for bartering with its impoverished ally on the Timor Sea maritime boundary in the early 2000s. Such documents are generally released after 20 years, but these records have been partially suppressed, because the government ruled their contents could cause “damage to the security, defence or international relations of the commonwealth”. As part of his case, Patrick has tendered evidence from revered former Timor-Leste president Xanana Gusmão. Gusmão advocated for the release of unredacted documents relating to the affair, saying it would help the bilateral relationship between Australia and Timor-Leste, not harm it. Gusmão said: Continued secrecy creates a sense of suspicion and impropriety and cannot remain a feature of our good neighbourly relations. Dr Greg French, a former Australian ambassador to Italy, gave expert advice to the Australian government about the release of the document, saying it could harm international relations. At a hearing on Tuesday, he was asked whether the comments of Gusmão changed his opinion. He said: No, senator. I still stand by the judgment that I made, which is a comprehensive assessment made on the basis of a whole range of factors. The hearing continues. Updated at 5.54am BST 5.44am BST Let’s return briefly to the speech by the chief of the Australian defence force, General Angus Campbell. He offered some further thoughts on the changing character of war – and what a small military force needed to do to “disrupt” the plans of “a sophisticated numerically superior adversary”. Addressing the Royal Australian Navy’s sea power conference in Sydney, Campbell said: Operational and tactical military success in the 21st century will require an integrated force, highly skilled in synchronised and concurrent multi-domain war-fighting. Success is about the mastery of combined effects across all domains, supported by enablers like intelligence, communications and logistics - a mastery, I’d have to say, clearly absent in Russia’s early assault on Ukraine. Planning and operational execution will need to be truly orchestrated if a smaller skilled force is to inflict significant damage to a sophisticated numerically superior adversary. And we don’t necessarily need to defeat an adversary, but we do need to disrupt their plan. Campbell said an effective Australian joint force needed to work cohesively both within its own services and alongside allies and partners. He said operating together as a combined force was increasingly important but was also “increasingly challenging to achieve”: And integration is required at other levels – a greater sharing of ideas, combined strategies, joint logistics, deep industrial base collaboration, cooperation on research and development, increased training and deployment to support preparedness, and synchronised multi-domain exercising ... To realise that potential, to be ready when it’s needed, we need to translate our relationships into well-practised behaviours and procedures necessary to secure our common interests.

General Angus Campbell addressed the Royal Australian Navy’s sea power conference in Sydney a short time ago. Campbell said the war in Ukraine was 14,000km from Australia but “we can still learn from it”, including to support preparedness in the maritime domain. Referring to Russia’s loss of its flagship Moskva in the Black Sea, Campbell said it was “the largest warship to sink in conflict since the Falklands war”. He went on to speculate about what a war might look like in our own region: Should the worst be realised – that conflict eventuates in the Indo-Pacific – it will not be confined to a single domain. Campbell said such a conflict would be fought across multiple domains: at sea and underwater, on land, in the air, in cyber and in space. He said the boundaries between conflict, coercion and competition were increasingly blurred, and “there is a need to today for a greater integration of power”: The notion of integrated campaigning involves military power being brought together with other elements of national power – economic, diplomatic, trade, financial, industrial, scientific and informational – and combined with the military and national powers of allies and partners. This aggregated and integrated power, appropriately focused and persistent in its application, will lend weight and effectiveness against the continuum of 21st century challenges we now face. Campbell said it was important to “keep front of mind” the factors that were changing the character of conflict, and their implications. He pointed to a technological revolution. Just as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and 3D printing were altering society, he said, these technological developments were “also driving a rapid military transformation”. He cited uncrewed vehicles, longer range weapons, and advanced sensors. We’ll see investment in crewed, uncrewed and mixed capabilities … We need both crewed and uncrewed systems working together. It’s why Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States are partnering under Aukus to develop, among many things, autonomous underwater vehicles, which will serve as a force multiplier to our submarines and surface fleet.

A swiftwater rescue team helped the man in his 20s to safety after he became trapped in Soldiers Hill, a suburb of Mount Isa, about 11pm on Monday. A severe weather warning has been issued from Townsville west to Cloncurry, and from Croydon in the north and south to Blackall. The Bureau of Meteorology has warned flash flooding is likely with six-hour rainfall totals of 60-100mm forecast from Wednesday. The highest rainfalls overnight were recorded in Kirby, near Winton, with 97mm till 6am on Tuesday. Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the SES received 39 calls for assistance overnight, with more significant rain expected throughout week. “The bureau has advised some locations may receive their highest may rainfall on record this week,” she told parliament. Heavy rain is unusual outside the wet season, and some areas are set to be hit with 10 times the monthly average for May in just 24 to 48 hours. The bureau says six-hour falls of up to 150mm are also possible in the Central West and North West districts. Flood watches are in place for northern, central, western, and south-eastern Queensland, with the remaining central Queensland catchments to be assessed on Tuesday.

Updated at 5.05am BST 4.59am BST The Greens have launched their environmental policies today, with the party’s leader, Adam Bandt, declaring the decline of the country’s wildlife “one of the greatest failings in our nation’s history”. The party has already said it will push for a target of zero extinctions by 2030 and today announced a plan for a $24.4bn investment in nature restoration over a decade. Called the “Green Australia Plan” the fund would be used to restore and regenerate habitat, forest and bushland, coastal areas and rivers and to improve green spaces in urban areas. There are also policies in response to the 2020 review of national environmental laws, which found governments have failed to protect the country’s unique wildlife. The party says it will push for the establishment of an independent environmental regulator to enforce the law, strong national environmental standards as recommended by the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel in his review, a ban on destroying habitat for koalas and other threatened species and scrapping of regional forestry agreements. They will also move for a “climate trigger” in national laws that would require the effects of large projects on the climate and carbon pollution to be assessed before they are approved. Bandt said governments were destroying Australia’s “icons and identity” through neglect of the country’s environment. Our environment is in crisis. Australia is the world leader in mammal extinction. More species of mammals die here than anywhere else, and they’re going extinct because of global heating and the Liberals’ decades-long refusal to protect our country. The Greens are the only party in this campaign with costed plans to tackle the extinction crisis and protect our environment. The package has been welcomed by the Australian Conservation Foundation, which called on the major parties to announce similarly ambitious policies in a campaign from which conservation has been notably absent.

The gender pay gap is 13.8%, compared to 17.4% when Labor lost power in 2013. But add the part-time workforce and the gap widens to 30.6%, according to official data. RMIT University economist Dr Leonora Risse said investing in the care sector will bring down cost-of-living pressures and repair the federal budget. “If you invest in the right things, you’re actually growing the economy without those inflationary pressures,” Risse told AAP. Across advanced economies, Australia has one of the biggest gaps between average male and female workforce participation and hours in paid work. New research from consultancy firm Impact Economics released on Tuesday shows women are doing more work than men but less of it is paid. As well as achieving the elusive productivity gains that Australia needs, the report found unlocking workforce participation by women could address critical skills shortages. While some tout migration as a solution, lead economist Dr Angela Jackson said Australia already has a skilled workforce that is “chronically under-utilised” – our women. Halving the workforce participation gap between men and women would unlock 500,000 workers, and closing it represents the equivalent of an additional one million workers, Jackson said. Making childcare more affordable, which both major parties want to achieve, will free up more unpaid carers - mostly women - to go to work, spend more and pay income tax. As well as cheaper childcare and action on superannuation to bridge career gaps, advocates also want help for carers - mostly women - to get jobs, education and training. Analysis commissioned by Carers Australia found Australia’s 2.65 million carers face significant financial disadvantage, even if they qualify for a carer’s allowance. Carers on average forego $392,500 in lost wages to the age of 67 and miss a further $175,000 in superannuation, a report from economic consultancy Evaluate found. Those who are informal unpaid carers for extended periods will lose even more, with the hardest hit 10 per cent losing at least $940,000 in lifetime income and $444,500 in superannuation. “Carers are often hidden in our community, with initiatives for their specific support needs, be they financial, health or wellbeing, overlooked,” Carers Australia acting chief executive, Melanie Cantwell, said. Further, the Covid-19 recession hit women harder than men, in jobs lost and a greater burden of home-schooling, which put them further at risk of poverty in retirement. Six months out of the workforce can add another $100,000 to the average $2m lifetime earnings gap between men and women with children in Australia, according to the Grattan Institute.

We need leaders who will stop pouring millions into fracking which is destroying our country, when we still don’t have basic services and clean energy to keep power running. Mr Gunner lifted the fracking moratorium, against the wishes of Traditional Owners, knowing that we have not consented to what’s being planned on our country. The new Premier must listen to us when we say, we do not want fracking, full stop.

In a rare public address in Sydney today, hosted by the Lowy Institute to mark the 70th anniversary of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the agency’s director general, Paul Symon, spoke of the need for his organisation to “remain low profile but … not have no profile” as it seeks to adapt to the modern intelligence gathering environment. Symon said emerging technologies are posing “a near-existential” risk to the work of services such as Asis, because it has meant Australia’s “covert activities” are “increasingly discoverable”. Symon said: As we move forward, Asis will need more officers with more diverse skills and backgrounds supported by more integrated capabilities. We are going to need to recruit and work with even more vigour and urgency than at any other point in our 70-year history. At the same time as our operating environment has become more competitive and volatile, it has also become increasingly difficult to conduct human intelligence work. While it remains a core component of statecraft, it must adapt to meet the extraordinary challenges arising from the interaction of a complex strategic environment, intensified counter-intelligence efforts, and emergent and emerging technologies. For a service like my own there is a near-existential dimension to technology risk. The analogue systems and processes which spies of the past took for granted have been relegated to history, and we now live in a fundamentally digital era where our covert activities are increasingly discoverable. In this technological sandbox, authoritarian regimes are having a ‘heyday’. Symon also revealed that Asis “inserted” a “small team” of officers into Afghanistan as the Taliban seized power last year, including officers in the “chaos” of crowds seeking to leave the country at Kabul’s international airport, as they facilitated evacuations. Updated at 4.09am BST 3.50am BST Labor’s shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has also responded to Scott Morrison’s comments on a federal Icac today: Mr Morrison will never establish an integrity commission because he’s terrified of what it will find. He’s terrified it will hold him and his government to account for their rorts and corruption. That’s why Mr Morrison broke his 2019 election promise to the Australian people that that he would establish an anti-corruption commission. Mr Morrison won’t act. Labor will. In government Labor will establish a powerful, transparent and independent national anti-corruption commission. Updated at 3.51am BST 3.47am BST Alan Tudge: 'If I am in a position to step back into cabinet, I will do so' Alan Tudge has been found by a Sky News reporter on the campaign trail in his electorate. Q: You know that the Department of Finance is negotiating a $500,000 payout for your former staffer Rachelle Miller, and why would they be doing that? Tudge: As the prime minister said, he’s unaware, I’m unaware. It’s a matter for the Department of Finance. Q: If you’ve been cleared of allegations though, why would they be organising a half a million dollar payout? Tudge: I’m not aware of any of those things I have no information. I haven’t been called as a witness. I haven’t been asked to provide evidence and as the prime minister said, if it involved me, he would have been made aware and hasn’t been made aware. Q: And just finally, on your former staffer, there are reports that you asked her to keep quiet to a formal security review. Why would you have done that? Tudge: Well, I didn’t do that. I just asked her to tell the truth. Q: Why have you not made any appearances? Why have you kept a low profile during these final weeks of campaigning ahead of the election? Tudge: Well, I’ve been very busy in my local electorate here. You can see from my social media, and I stood down from being education minister some months ago now, for family, for health reasons, to concentrate on my electorate, and that’s exactly what I’ve been doing. Q: Are you looking to maintain the ministership, however, for the election? Tudge: The prime minister has made clear that should we be re-elected, and I am in a position to step back up, I will do so. Q: Are you looking forward to this election? What do you think the outcome will be? Tudge: Well, it’s very tight, but I’m confident that we can win. Q: Why have you been avoiding media questioning and why have you refused to debate the Labor shadow education minister? Tudge: Well, Stuart Robert is the acting education minister at the moment since I’ve been stood down so he would be the appropriate person to do that. Updated at 3.51am BST 3.31am BST Australian Bar Association 'deeply concerned' by Scott Morrison's 'attack' on barristers The Australian Bar Association has issued a strong statement in response to comments Scott Morrison made in his press conference today: The Australian Bar Association is deeply concerned by the Prime Minister’s attack today on the barristers of Australia, stating that he “didn’t care if [they] disagree with me” and that “I’ve never had much truck with them over the course of my entire political career.” ABA President Dr Matt Collins AM QC said, “Australia’s more than 6,000 hardworking barristers are committed to promoting the administration of justice. They abide by a cab rank rule, which requires them to accept briefs within their area of expertise and ensures that all Australians have an entitlement to representation. Every year, they provide countless hours of pro bono and poorly remunerated assistance to people from Australia’s most disadvantaged communities. They frequently stand between the individual and the State, and provide a bulwark for the rule of law. Any person who has no truck with barristers cannot have made a conscientious effort to understand their indispensable contribution to civic society.” The Prime Minister’s comments were made in the context of the ongoing debate about the need for a federal anti-corruption commission. Dr Collins said, “While there is room for debate about the design, powers and mode of operation of anti-corruption bodies, it is neither correct nor constructive to characterise the NSW ICAC as a kangaroo court. A kangaroo court is a body that operates with disregard for or perversion of legal procedure. The ICAC Commissioners are highly experienced and respected jurists who preside over investigations conducted according to law and the powers given to them by the NSW Parliament.

It couldn’t necessarily be achieved in my term as chief, but how do we break the cycles of social dysfunction, trauma, dispossession? There is a lot that goes into that bucket. The other big challenge we have got as a Territory is the boom-bust cycle. We have seen it happen continually, and how do we set the Territory up for the long term that cuts through on that social side, that cuts through on the economic side? Sometimes these things are meant to be and come together. I have come to this decision holding Nash and knowing what is best for me and my family and I am finishing my last task delivering a budget. You can see in this budget the pathway forward, the economic boom-bust cycle ending, and you can see it is going to be hard, grinding, back-breaking effort but you can see the social change happening. Year after year, we are seeing reduction in overcrowding. There still has to be more done with overcrowding. We are seeing less Aboriginal children out of home care. We are seeing more [children] in preschool ... 3-year-olds and onwards. We are seeing that change occur. For me, the best thing that could ever happen is if, in a generation or two time, I can see that absolute change. More local jobs. We are reducing that constant social cycle throughout generations. That is the big challenge that I set myself. We can see that change. That is what I was after.

It was a far more collegiate and friendly affair with Ray Hadley than when Anthony Albanese joined the program recently, with the shock jock giving Morrison free rein to talk up Australia’s economic recovery and complain about Labor’s advertising campaign. Hadley sympathised that “it must be frustrating” for Morrison to hear Labor’s negative ads which play Morrison saying “not my job”. “This is what Labor does, they don’t have a plan for government,” the PM replied, explaining the context in which he uttered the infamous “not my job” claims. “The three quotes they’re using, I was asked ‘should I be afraid of the pandemic?’ No that isn’t my job, to be afraid of the pandemic. It isn’t my job to shout down the phone at premiers,” Morrison said.

Who cares about China when our producers could access that amount of people? I repeat, not enough effort has been made by the current Government to open new markets. I saw half a kilometre of mangoes going to waste on the Atherton Tablelands and we are also having an oversupply of avocados. Senior negotiators should be sent by Australia into these countries.

Consumer sentiment had slumped in the previous week, according to the regular survey by the ANZ and Roy Morgan, and there were some views that the Reserve Bank’s first cash rate rise in 11 years might scare the shoppers. Well, the dent to consumer sentiment turned out to be a modest 0.2% compared with a week earlier, when confidence sank 6% to the lowest since the January Covid supply chain woes. Weekly survey of consumer sentiment by @ANZ_Research and @RoyMorganAus finds only a modest drop in confidence - but rate remains well below the long-run average. #auspol #ausvotes #ausvotes2022 pic.twitter.com/WirdABM70U — Peter Hannam (@p_hannam) May 9, 2022 Still, David Plank, the ANZ’s top economist for Australia, noted that while the RBA hike was largely anticipated, it was “not entirely without impact”. “Confidence among people who are ‘paying off their home loan’ dropped by 5%, reinforcing the 9.6% drop in the previous week,” Plank said. “This was partially offset by the increase in confidence for those who already own their home or are renting by 1.3% and 2.6%, respectively.” Also probably pleasing for the RBA was a modest pullback in households’ inflation expectations - easing both weekly and on a rolling four-week average by 0.2 percentage points. Also a bit reassuring for the RBA is that inflation expectations have eased back a bit after the central bank raised the cash rate last Tuesday. What the bank didn't want to see is those expectations taking flight... @ANZ_Research, @RoyMorganAus pic.twitter.com/QQjRr6eUVE — Peter Hannam (@p_hannam) May 9, 2022 .What’s interesting is that the ACTU pitch might look a bit ambitious but the first-quarter CPI was 5.1%, and the RBA last week noted in its statement on monetary policy the consumer inflation rate would be running at 5.5% by June. By December the CPI will be at 6%, and by June 2023 the central bank is predicting it will ease back to 4.25%. The RBA is forecasting the CPI to peak just under 6% by December, but retreat to a 4.25% by next June. On its recent track record, the RBA and most other central banks have been a little too conservative about how sharp the spike in prices has been. If 5.5% looks on the high side, it’s worth noting the minimum wage of $20.33 for the current fiscal year was up 2.5% on the previous year. On our current track, that increase is less than half the 5%-plus CPI increase for the year – hence that minimum wage got a bit more mini. Updated at 1.43am BST 1.21am BST The press conference ends. Updated at 1.30am BST 1.21am BST Q: You’ve spoken a lot about your record as infrastructure minister, creating Infrastructure Australia to take the politics out of it and put money into projects that stack up. Why, then, did you promise $10 billion as the Shadow infrastructure minister for the suburban rail loop at the last election? There was no business case to Infrastructure Australia. That would have been the biggest investment ever by a Federal Government in a transport project and no evidence then that it stacked up? Anthony Albanese: This is a game-changing project. This is a game changing project. When you look at the way that cities operate around the world, you look at any of them, and what you need to avoid, and something that we did ... This is a natural extension of the work that was done... You couldn’t do this before you did the metro project, because you need to fix the hub and then you need the spokes to be connected. That is what you need to do. That is what the projects– for example, extending the Queensland line in Springfield – do. That’s what Regional Rail Link did here in Victoria. What you need to do is to make sure – and I make this point as well and this is the last one I’ll make, because it’s a good one! ... Because if you get advice from any transport economist and you look at the way that cities work, Infrastructure Australia and the major cities unit that I established ... One of the works that they did is that you need to prioritise urban public transport, and you need to fix the way that they operate. And you need to stop the circumstance whereby whether you’re in Box Hill and want to go to western Melbourne and you’ve got to go right through the city, or whether you’re from Ballarat and Bendigo and you’ve got to go into the city in order to get to the south-east, you fix that problem. This is the same issue that our major cities are confronting. And a city like Melbourne, a great global city of growing to eight or nine million over coming years. You see the growth that is there. We did ... I had the great honour of opening projects like Tahnee, a new rail station with the Regional Rail Link. You know what we did when we were in government – we promised projects, we provided the funding and we opened them during that period in government. During that period in government. I’ll wait for the nation-building projects that are being covered by this government. Crickets! That is the answer, that these nation-building projects should be where the commonwealth government prioritises. We did, when I was the Minister for Infrastructure, we funded – more commonwealth fund investment went into urban public transport than all previous governments combined for 107 years. Six years versus 107. Why did we do that? Because urban public transport has to be an absolute priority. Our cities – we are the most urbanised country on the planet. Our cities need urban public transport. We’ll work with state governments to get that done. Updated at 1.30am BST 1.19am BST Q: On integrity, have you got plans for a national anti-corruption commission? What problems do you see with Victoria’s IBAC model? And do you think that all witnesses and hearings should be held in public? Anthony Albanese: I think that politicians shouldn’t comment about IBAC and processes which are taking place. Q: You are proposing a federal Icac? Albanese: Yeah, I’m talk to talk about a national anti-corruption commission. Q: And what you’re promising at a federal level. Would it be acceptable for that federal body to examine politicians in secret behind closed doors? Albanese: It would be acceptable for that body to operate according to how it sees it should operate, and not take directives from politicians about how it operates. Updated at 1.27am BST 1.17am BST Anthony Albanese: I want to make two points. One is that I want to work with all Premiers constructively. That’s what I did when I was in government last time, including the New South Wales Coalition Government, the Coalition Government, that I sat down with and negotiated, for example, $405 million from each level of Government to do what’s now call NorthConnex. I sat down with the Victorian Liberal Government and we negotiated $3 billion for the metro project. Not with the Labor Government, but with the Liberal Government. And then, and then, it was delayed, and the reason why it’s not all done a long time ago was because that was cut. I prioritised funding, not based upon an electoral map, based upon need. We had $7.6 billion to the Pacific Highway that ran through Coalition seats by and large, compared with the Howard Government’s $1.3 billion. We had a similar figure, over $7 billion, for the Bruce Highway compared with the Howard government’s $1.3 billion. We funded projects like Gold Coast Light Rail that went nowhere near any Labor electorates, I assure you, but was a priority project approved by Infrastructure Australia. We approved all of the projects that went through the Infrastructure Australia process. That’s the difference between me and Mr Morrison. Nation-building projects that make a difference on infrastructure compared with the Coalition – a Coalition that just get out the colour-coded maps, that say that this is not a national priority for the national Government, but a commuter car park is, that they announce and then cancel. And an example as well, I’ll make this second point, is that I also want to work with Dominic Perrottet and the Tasmanian new Liberal Premier in Tasmania, and anyone who is a state leader. And today, there’s an announcement in Epping – one that I will support as well. I know the New South Wales Liberal Government promised this four years ago and nothing’s happened, but we will match, certainly, that commitment that is forward. Updated at 1.26am BST 1.15am BST Q: The Federal Liberal Party says that you’re a drag on Federal Labor? Daniel Andrews: This is the thing about the federal Liberal party, they say lots of things and they do very little. They do very little. If only their talk mattered. If only the pure politics of these people mattered. Let me be really clear with you – when Victorians were at their darkest time, senior Federal Liberals proved to be Liberals first and Victorians second. They thought that they were bagging our government – they were bagging every Victorian who was following the rules and doing the right thing. And that might be one of the reasons why they’re in a bit of trouble in their seats. At the end of the day, this is Albo’s press conference and back to him! Updated at 1.23am BST 1.14am BST Q: This morning, Scott Morrison said Anthony Albanese as Prime Minister would be a pushover to Labor Premiers like yourself. You’ve had a rocky relationship during the pandemic with Mr Morrison. Do you think that you’d get more money out of Scott Morrison or Anthony Albanese? Daniel Andrews: Well, the record is very clear ... Every federal dollar that Victorians get from the miserable Morrison Government, where we ought to bow our head and treat it like it’s foreign aid. We have been ripped off by this Liberal-National Government, and instead of Mr Morrison talking about the issue, he ought to have been here delivering for Victorian workers and families. I’ve had a conversation with the Prime Minister about suburban rail loop, and zero dollars. Zero dollars. The contrast could not be clearer. Anthony Albanese is about building things. He’s about partnership. He’s about creating jobs. He’s about making sure that our cities and regions, our nation, actually works. [Scott Morrison is] a bloke who is so desperate, because he’s been there for a decade and done precisely nothing. Done precisely nothing. This project stacks up. This project more than stacks up. It’s not a cost, it’s an investment in jobs and a road and rail network that actually takes people where they want to go, and $2.2 billion is a very significant commitment. We would always like more. But $2.2 billion versus zero from Scott Morrison – you know, this is what desperate people who have built nothing and done nothing, got an excuse for everything and a plan for nothing – this is the sort of stuff that comes out of prime ministers who are just run out of time. Updated at 1.22am BST 1.13am BST Q: Mr Albanese, new research shows that in female-dominated industries, people earn up to 36% less than in male-dominated industries. You’re meeting with businesses after the election, if you win, to talk about wages. What will you do specifically for those industries like childcare and aged care to boost those wages? Anthony Albanese: Thank you for the question. It’s a good one. And I note that the women business leaders have made a significant statement today that’s covered in the newspapers. And that is one of the reasons why we have said that gender pay should be – pay equity should be made an objective of the Fair Work Act. Because there have been 21 separate cases taken to the Fair Work Act over more than, going back more than a decade, of which only one has been successful. And if you look at the structural difference, the gender pay gap in Australia is 13.8%. Now, that represents a structural weakness in our industrial relations system whereby, because only one of ... I think it’s 21 cases from memory have been taken. The only one that was successful was in 2012 when Julia Gillard was the prime minister in the social and community services award. What that did was grant a significant pay increase for workers in that sector. The evidence, when you go back and look at the consequences of that decision, are that a largely feminised industry of community workers have stayed in the industry [and] have, therefore, been more productive. [They] have, therefore, been able to go up the career chain and earn higher wages, and therefore, earn more superannuation and better retirement incomes. But when you have 21 separate cases being taken, and only one being successful, then there’s a structural problem there. And specifically, as well, the aged care case that’s before the Fair Work Commission at the moment – aged care workers are paid $22 an hour. This is tough work. It’s demanding physically. But it’s also demanding emotionally, in terms of their mental health. We have said that we will make a submission saying that the Fair Work Commission should bear in mind the evidence that’s before the Royal Commission into aged care that recognised that there was a crisis, recognised that unless we do something, then people will continue to leave the sector. Updated at 1.16am BST 1.11am BST Q: On regional housing – the Regional Australia Institute has brought out a report this morning talking about the pressures on regional housing areas. At the moment, they’re saying that people are not able to fill the job vacancies there because they can’t find housing. Rental vacancies are as low as 1%. What specifically is Labor doing to help regional housing? Anthony Albanese: It’s a major issue. Because one of the things that happened during the pandemic was that more people discovered they could work from home and could move to regions. And one of the things that used to be more attractive about regions was that housing costs were lower. But we’ve seen some of the highest increases in housing being in places like Launceston in Tasmania. It is something that we need to address. We have announced a range of housing policies, including our Housing Australia Future Fund. ... Regions will be a part of that program, as well as the Help to Buy program, which as you’d be aware, I think that you were with us on the Central Coast with the young woman who saw that that program would help her, potentially, and her partner, to have access to housing. A program, I might add, that’s working very effectively here in Victoria. Updated at 1.14am BST 1.09am BST On funding Closing the Gap, Anthony Albanese says: Well, we have already. And Penny Wong, in my one-week absence, went to Alice Springs to make the major announcement that I was going to make, which was for 500 additional First Nations health worker, including for areas like dialysis and life-saving projects. With he made a number of announcements through Linda Burney in places like western New South Wales and Ceduna and South Australia. We do need to close the gap when it comes to Indigenous health. This is a very serious issue. 1.08am BST Q: Just back to wages. You said that you don’t want people to go backwards. Does that mean that you would support a wage hike of 5.1% just to keep up with inflation? Anthony Albanese: Absolutely. 1.08am BST Q: On today’s announcement, you said previously that you would fund infrastructure projects that stack up against Infrastructure Australia’s model. This particular project, though, hasn’t been assessed and isn’t on Infrastructure Australia’s priority list. So how does that stack up? Anthony Albanese: Well, this project does stack up because it’s got a BCR of 1.7. I’ll tell you what doesn’t stack up - commuter car parks announced at the last election ... ... Yes, it has a BCR - a benefit cost ratio of 1.7. 1 opinion 7. The other thing ... The other thing that we’ve said. You’ve asked your question. You’ve asked your question. You get to ask it, I get to answer it. That’s how these things work. Infrastructure Australia, that model has been undermined. When I was the Infrastructure Minister, we had Sir Rod Eddington as the chair of Infrastructure Australia. He now is the chair of Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, the major private sector body, all of the big players in infrastructure in this body, regard him as significant enough to be the chair of that body. Sir Rod Eddington was someone who was knighted for saving British Airways. He’s been on the News Corp board. Rio Tinto – a senior news person. We had Mark Birrell, the minister under the Kennett government, as the deputy head. We had Heather Ridout. We had serious work being done. Now, Infrastructure Australia is now chaired by ... He might be a good bloke, but he was the mayor of one of Barnaby Joyce’s local councils, who has said that he’s going to travel around Australia in a caravan – fair enough, he’s retired – and ring in to the Infrastructure Australia board. This is a board and a process that we took seriously. This is a process that’s been undermined by a government that hasn’t taken it seriously. Updated at 1.13am BST 1.06am BST Q: Are you concerned about taking larger deficits than the government to the election forecast? Anthony Albanese: We’ll, of course, put all of our costings out before the election. I assume the government will too. Now, people have started voting in this election. They started yesterday. And I note that record numbers of people – anecdotal evidence, we don’t have the precise figures – but the reports around the country is record people are voting early and record people are also putting in postal votes, so there’s some 2 million people have applied for postal votes. That will be a record number. We encourage people to vote in our democracy. The coalition have not yet had their campaign launch, have not yet had their campaign launch. I assume at a campaign launch you have some policy announcements, so all of the sort of adding-up of where both sides are can’t occur. The idea that you can do that before the coalition had its campaign launch is, in my view, completely untenable. Updated at 1.12am BST 1.03am BST Q: On Labor’s teaching bursary, was it misleading to say it was a $50 million investment covering 5,000 spots when that dollar amount will only cover 3,000 spots in your first [term] Anthony Albanese: Not at all. Our project – let’s be clear about what the announcement was yesterday. We put out the cost that we gave, the full cost yesterday, was $146.5 million. That’s the cost over the forward estimates of the entire program, right? That was the cost over the entire program of the announcements that we made yesterday. The forward estimates costs are completely accurate. This is 2-year and 4-year degrees. We’ve said 1,000 places a year. Not all of those are within the forward estimates. Updated at 1.08am BST 1.01am BST Q: I do have two questions. Anthony Albanese: Well, you get one. Q: On suburban rail loop, you’ve committed $2.2 billion. This has been slated by the federal government for much more money in the past, even up to $10 billion. Albanese: We’re making our commitment today because that is what we are putting forward to Victoria. We, of course, will work – this is a project that will go for a long period of time. We’re hoping to begin very soon in the next 12 months for early works, but this is a nation-building project. Our commercial commitment is what we’re making today, which is $2.2 billion. What that will do is it should give the Victorian government confidence that they’ll have a partner with the national government. Updated at 1.06am BST 1.00am BST Asked about not explicitly backing the ACTU’s submission to the FWC and why wage rises shouldn’t outstrip inflation, Albanese says: ... You should be able to pay your rent, to buy food, to get by. And the Fair Work Commission should bear that in mind in the decision that they make. The difference at this election campaign is very stark and very clear. We have a government that have low wage growth as a key feature of their economic architecture. They’ve said that. And that is what they have done over 10 years. Labor has a plan - Labor has a plan to lift wages and that is what we will do. A stark difference between the two. Updated at 1.05am BST 12.57am BST 'Every human being deserves respect,' Albanese says Anthony Albanese is with Daniel Andrews making the surburban rail loop announcement in Melbourne. But the questions are about what we have been talking about today. Q: Katherine Deves, the Liberal party candidate, has doubled down on her comments that gender reassignment surgery is mutilation. Is that an appropriate comment for a political candidate to be making? And how do you respond? Albanese: I don’t believe it is an appropriate comment and I’ll make this point – vulnerable people, in particular, are deserving of respect. Every human being deserves respect. What we need to look for from our national political leaders is ways to unify the country and bring people together, not play politics in order to divide people. Updated at 12.59am BST 12.43am BST Victoria reports 18 Covid deaths It has also been a difficult day in Victoria. We thank everyone who got vaccinated and tested yesterday. Our thoughts are with those in hospital, and the families of people who have lost their lives. More data soon: https://t.co/OCCFTAtS1P#COVID19Vic #COVID19VicData pic.twitter.com/68pEWzrwqd — VicGovDH (@VicGovDH) May 9, 2022 Updated at 12.50am BST 12.42am BST The press conference ends. Updated at 12.47am BST 12.42am BST 'What has this got to do with the question?' reporter asks PM Q: Do you regret the fact that a candidate you picked, Katherine Deves, has become a distraction at the start of the campaign. And can I ask Simon Kennedy a question? Morrison: If you’d like? Why don’t you ask Simon first? Q: Do you believe there’s reason to be concerned about the safety of mRNA vaccines and what are your thoughts on vaccine mandates for some industries? Simon Kennedy: I think I’ve been very clear on this. I’m pro-science, pro-vaccines. My wife’s an infectious diseases doctor. We were one of the first few thousand people vaccinated in Australia, because of her job. Some weeks ago, or months ago, I expressed a comment that I was anti-blanket workforce mandates. Days after, that the New South Wales premier lifted the blanket prohibition orders, which I fully support, absolutely fully support and I think I’ve been very clear on that. In terms of the comments, yes, I said it had happened quite quickly. I stand by that and I stand by people’s freedom to choice. I just don’t believe when we’re at 95% vaccination levels in punishing people. That was all I said. Q: And on mRNA vaccines? Morrison: On your other question, the gender pay gap today has fallen to 13.8% from 17.4% when we first came to government. Now, just so people understand what that means, that means on average, because of the fall in the gender pay gap under our government, people are $70 better off because of what we’ve been able to achieve this closing the gender pay gap. Also as Prime Minister, for the first time, more than 50% of all Federal Government appointments to boards have now been female. On top of that, I have the highest number of female members of my Cabinet since federation... Q: Sorry – what’s this got to do with this question? Morrison: Since federation began – and I’m about to tell you what it’s got to do. I have no doubts in selecting a strong woman who wanted to represent the Liberal Party at this election. Not everybody may agree with her point of view. I accept that. I wouldn’t think anybody would agree with what I have to say either. But I do think and I was very determined to ensure that I would have more female members representing the Liberal Party at this election and where I’ve had the opportunity to have a direct say in that, I have ensured that that has been delivered and that is consistent with my approach. One of the things we’ve announced today is over $40 million to support women going into non-traditional trades and into digital and manufacturing careers. I started this press conference by talking about the investments that we’re making in skills, and one of the big shifts that can occur is by ensuring more and more women have the opportunity to go into areas of our economy that they haven’t entered into before. I’m seeing it in the mining industry. I’m seeing it in the manufacturing industry. All critical areas of skill and in our Defence Forces as well. I’m absolutely pleased that I’ve been able to recruit and we’ve been able to appoint strong female Liberal candidates that won’t just run with the pack when it comes to issues but will stand up for what they believe in. That’s what being a Liberal is all about. Thank you very much. Updated at 12.55am BST 12.39am BST NSW premier defends Icac in front of Scott Morrison NSW premier Dominic Perrottet then tries to walk a very tight line. Perrottet: I believe the prime minister and I are completely on the same page in relation to driving integrity in public office, whether that’s politicians or the public service. Q: But he calls it a kangaroo court. Perrottet: I accept we may disagree in relation to the operation of the New South Wales model. But at its heart, what we both agree on is that there should be integrity agencies in place that ensure the best standards in public life. And whether that’s in the public service or in politicians, that is the expectation right around the country and in New South Wales. I agree with the prime minister in relation to – it’s not a one-size-fits-all approach. With our integrity agency, the Icac in New South Wales, it differs from other integrity agencies in other state jurisdictions. I think it is welcome that at a commonwealth level they’re working through that. As the prime minister has said, their work is hundreds of pages long and it’s important they get it right and it’s important ... Q: But are public hearings going too far? Too many public hearings? Perrottet: When it comes to any agency in the New South Wales government, we always look at them in terms of ways we can improve and if there’s areas where we can improve here in New South Wales, we will. But ultimately, here in our state, the Icac has played an important role in maintaining high standards in public office and in the public service. We have people in jail today because of their behaviour and the corruption that occurred in relation to – I’ll take Eddie Obeid for example, in the previous government, which corruptly used taxpayer dollars for personal benefit. And as premier of this state, whether it’s politicians or whether it’s the public service, I expect the highest standards of integrity and I want to ensure that - not just that that is maintained in our state but ultimately, as well, the public have confidence in government in the standards they have in the delivery of public service in our state. Updated at 12.51am BST 12.35am BST 'Anthony Albanese is just making it up,' says Scott Morrison Scott Morrison continues: Hang on. You’ve asked a long question and I’m giving you a very comprehensive answer. The second phase of our integrity commission, which is set out in our 347 pages of legislation, deals with the broader issues of criminality across the entire public service, the entire public service, the vast majority of which don’t have any coercive powers in relation to the decisions that they take, which is another difference between the federal and the state jurisdictions. So my point is this – what may or may not work at a state level is not a guide to what should be done at a federal level and I don’t believe the New South Wales ICAC model is the right model for the federal jurisdiction. I have serious criticisms of the New South Wales ICAC model. I’ve never been a fan of how it’s conducted itself. And I don’t care if barristers and lawyers and others up there in Macquarie Street – not in the Parliament but in the barristers’ chambers – disagree with me. They disagree with me all the time. I’ve never had much truck with them over the course of my entire political career. I’ll leave them to what they do and all the rest of it I’ll focus on what I think is the right model for Australia because I don’t intend, when we introduce our model, to get it wrong. I think the design of it has to be right. It’s not just about having any integrity commission, one that is driven by populism, one that has just been driven by the latest thought bubble. Labor’s policy is two pages. Ours is 347 pages of legislation. Anthony Albanese is just making it up! Updated at 12.46am BST 12.33am BST Q: One of the commissioners of the New South Wales Icac has said that those who describe the New South Wales Icac as a kangaroo court are buffoons. You’ve described it as a kangaroo court. Are you a buffoon, given his comment? And a question for Premier Perrottet – you’ve obviously disagreed on that kangaroo court label for the New South Wales Icac. I’d like you to tell us here today what’s wrong with calling it a kangaroo court. Why is it not a kangaroo court? Scott Morrison: I didn’t quite understand the last part of your question. It sort of got a bit muddled. Q: The question is that Stephen Rushton ... Morrison: I understood that bit. I didn’t understand the last part. Q: Premier Perrottet clearly disagrees with the description ... Morrison: OK. Sure, OK. Q: I’d like him to ... say why it’s wrong to call it a kangaroo court. Morrison: I stand by everything I said on the matter. I don’t believe the New South Wales Icac is a model we should follow at the federal level. I’ve seen it come and destroy people’s reputations and careers before it has even made a finding. I don’t think that’s good process. And I’m not alone in that. Chris Merritt, a distinguished legal affairs writer with the Australian has written sharing my view about this. Stephen Conroy, a former Labor communications minister, has expressed sympathy with my views when it comes to what is the best way to go ahead. I’ve also made this point – the issues you’re dealing with on integrity are different at a federal level to a state level. At state level, you’re dealing with development consents, gaming, gambling and horse racing and a range of other issues which are very different sets of issues than at a federal level. At a federal level, it’s issues around taxation, competition policy, law enforcement, integrity, immigration decisions ... Q: But you’re dealing with grants, property deals and a lot of money where there’s ... Morrison: But the difference is ... Q: It’s a question of integrity. Morrison: No. The difference is this. When it comes to issues of decisions made by the Federal Government, all the things I’m referring to, those decisions are made at arm’s length by officials. And that’s why the first phase of our integrity commission proposal has already been implemented. We have already done it with the transformation of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commission, in expanding its remit to the ACCC, the ATO and a range of financial regulatory authorities and that’s important because they are the things that federal governments deal with and we’ve already put $50m in to support that. Now, the second tranche ... Updated at 12.53am BST 12.28am BST Q: But what if the minimum wage didn’t go up? Scott Morrison: It is for them to consider those issues and make that decision, in the same way it’s for the Reserve Bank to independently make their decision on what’s happening with cash rates. They are the important institutional settings of how our economy is managed. Now, I’ve been around these issues for a long time. Treasurer for three years and coming up to almost four years as prime minister. I’ve been around the economic settings for a very long time and I know how they work. And that’s why you don’t carelessly go around and start prodding and poking and pretending that you have some magic wand that can raise wages and things like this with Mr Albanese has been going on about. This guy just doesn’t understand the economy and he just doesn’t understand how budgets work, because he’s never done one. And at a time when we are facing so much uncertainty, at a time where so much is at risk, at a time more broadly, internationally, in the security environment, there are real consequences for the decisions that people are making right now. This election is not a passive decision. It’s not one where there are no consequences either way. This is not just like voting in an online poll or something like that, which means nothing. The way you vote on Election Day and who you choose is going to have a very significant impact. I’ll give you an example of how. When I first ran for parliament in 2007, if I’d gone and knocked on people’s doors down there in the Sutherland Shire and I said, “If you elect Kevin Rudd, 800 boats will turn up with 50,000 people on them and 1,200 people will die, they will put in place policies that will set fire to and put in place overpriced school halls and they’ll completely crash the budget,” if I’d said that to people, they would have locked me up. That all happened. They changed to a Labor government from a strongly performing Howard-Costello government. At the last election, could you imagine, had the Australian people chosen differently at the last election and $387 billion of high taxes, abolishing negative gearing, retiree taxes, it goes on and on and on – could you imagine if that had been put on the Australian economy as we went into the pandemic? My point is simple – elections have consequences. The choices you make will have very serious consequences, and Mr Albanese is proving almost every single day the question mark on him about whether he’s up to it Updated at 12.42am BST 12.26am BST Q: Prime Minister, on wages, do you support Australians on the minimum wage getting a pay rise so it keeps up with the cost of living? Scott Morrison: I support the process we’ve always had for the setting of the minimum wage in this country and that is that it be independently assessed in a proper process based on the best facts and information about the economy. That’s why that process is in place. We have always welcomed and accepted the recommendations that have come from that body. Q: Are you worried that some people are really struggling? Morrison: Of course I do. That’s why we’ve halved the petrol tax. This is why we have given tax cuts. This is why those tax cuts today mean that an Australian earning $90,000 today, if they were on Labor’s tax rates that we inherited, they would be paying $50 a week more in tax every single week. Now, that goes on and on and in the next term, the tax plan that we have legislated ensures that those earning between $45,000 and $200,000 will pay no more than 30 cents marginal rate of tax. That is transformational. That is real tax reform that ensures that Australians keep more of what they earn. That is how we can address – see, there are only two ways ... Updated at 12.38am BST 12.25am BST On Labor’s housing equity scheme, Dominic Perrottet does not repeat Morrison’s “forced to sell” line: When it comes to housing affordability there is no doubt that this is a real challenge, not just here in our state, but around the country. I’m open to all ideas in relation to how we can drive home ownership. We cannot have an Australia that can’t house its children. And we have an obligation, I believe, to look at innovative thinking about helping particularly young people get their keys to their very first home. Now, reform is hard, and here in our state, we’ve done ... You know, we’ve been looking at a fair bit of work in relation to stamp duties. ... What we need to have is a constructive discussion. We should be open to all new ideas to help drive it. In our upcoming budget here in our state next month, there’ll be a real focus on housing affordability. Q: Do you agree that it’s a forced-to-buy scheme in the PM’s language? Perrottet: There will always be different views in relation to housing affordability. I think it’s important that we’re open-minded. From my perspective, that is certainly the approach that we will take in our state ... One thing, when it comes to housing affordability that states can do, is drive supply and open up opportunities and build infrastructure to support it. I was out with Minister Roberts recently in south-west Sydney where we’re looking at new developments, but importantly building the infrastructure. Now, politicians don’t like sometimes investing in those smaller infrastructure projects like water and sewerage because there’s no real ribbons to open on those, but ultimately, they are the investments that drive supply and provide opportunity. Outside of that, I’m very open to looking at new ways of thinking in relation to housing affordability. We’ve been doing that in our state and we’ll do that going forward. Updated at 12.36am BST 12.22am BST Q: There’s been coal-fired power outages. Has that driven up electricity price as soon as – and when will they start coming down? And if I may, Mr Perrottet, do you support an equity scheme? Is it a forced-to-buy scheme? Can you weigh in on that? Scott Morrison: On electricity prices, since I’ve become prime minister, electricity prices have come down by over 10%. There are many reasons for us being able to achieve that. The work we’ve done in the retail area and making sure the default offers don’t just put people’s prices up. We’ve been focused on ensuring the reliability guarantee so we can continue to have reliable, affordable power in the system. We’re working on a gas-fired power plant in the Hunter, in northern New South Wales, ensuring generation capacity which supports the large influx of renewable energy into the grid. That’s a good thing but at the same time, it does increase variability in the grid and it does involve intermittent power-generation sources which need to be If you’re bringing intermittent renewable sources into the grid, you need the base load reliable power to support the use of that renewable energy in the system. So one does work with the other. And we’re already seeing movements in prices now in terms of how they’re feeding into the coal that goes into energy production in this state and around the country. And we will see those prices move around a bit but what we have seen under us is electricity prices come down 10%. I made it clear yesterday that Labor’s policy that will put $20 billion of investment ahead of when it and where it needs to be in place, that takes on another $50 billion and more of investment which will only put electricity prices up and the estimates of electricity prices going up $560 year - and that’s not just assessments that we’ve made. Of course, the whole issue of transmission investments that are ill advised and ill timed, whether it’s the Grattan Institute or the Victorian Energy Policy Council or Frontier Economics, they’ve all said very clearly if you over invest, if you gold-plate the grid within transmission, it pushes energy prices up. It can be as much as 46% of your energy bill comes from those who invested in the transmission network getting their money back from you. And that’s why electricity prices go up if Anthony Albanese’s plan – which is to overinvest, gold-plate, ill-timed investments - that will just put your prices up, because he hasn’t thought it through. (Labor’s plan is for an independent body to make decisions about where the upgrades are needed) He hasn’t thought it through, like he has not thought through many policies, and nor has he costed them. He hasn’t submitted one policy for costing during this entire election. You cannot risk Labor with an Anthony Albanese-led government, with Anthony Albanese, who’s never put a Budget together in his entire life in government. And this is no time to be taking that risk with the serious up certainties that the Australian economy is facing closely. Updated at 12.34am BST 12.18am BST Q: You have a candidate talking about this in an inner-city seat. There’s a huge LGBT community in seats like Wentworth and Kooyong. What message is your candidate sending to them? And what pressure is it putting on people in those seats to retain their seats? And secondly, if Josh Frydenberg is put out because of these comments, who’s your pick for treasurer? Scott Morrison: You’ve made a bunch of comments I don’t accept. It’s about the individual Australian, adolescent or otherwise, that is confronted with these issues about surgery regarding their gender reassignment. [Note: it is called gender confirmation.] That’s the only thing that matters here. The only thing ... Q: But she said they’re being mutilated – Morrison: The only thing that matters here is their welfare and the choices that they’re seeking to make and understanding the serious consequences of those changes, and ensuring that they have the right support and that their families have the right support, so they can work through these difficult issues. That’s my only concern here. That’s my only concern. Q: Prime Minister, will you speak to her? Or will you get the chief medical officer to speak to her down the track? Are you tempted to go campaign with her? She’s just up the road? Morrison: I don’t sort of set out my campaign schedule, as you know - and we’ve gone over those issues before. I’m sure I’ll have the opportunity to speak to Katherine. Q: What will you say to her? Morrison: That will be between Katherine and I. Updated at 12.29am BST 12.15am BST Q: Prime Minister, Katherine Deves has said that it is the correct terminology to refer to that procedure as “surgically mutilated and sterilised”. If you stand by her, you must stand by her definition of that procedure. Will you engage with the fact as well – Morrison: No, I don’t accept ... [he also says “I am not a surgeon”] Q: There are no adolescents who can have this surgery. Prime Minister, you have implied that young people 18 and over can enter into a fundamentally life-changing surgery lightly. You said it’s not something to be taken into lightly. That implies – Morrison: Well, it isn’t something to be taken into lightly. Q: But you’re implying ... Morrison: No. You’re implying that. I’m not implying that. I’m simply saying that ... Q: Do you stand by her language – Morrison: No. I wouldn’t use that language. I wouldn’t use that language. Q: Have you spoken to her about the language? Morrison: I haven’t had the opportunity to speak to her. Q: Will you speak to her about what she’s been saying? Morrison: I’m sure we’ll have the opportunity to talk. I’m not a surgeon or the chief medical officer. Q: But – Morrison: I’m not the chief medical officer. Q: Children in Australia under 18 can’t undergo gender reassignment surgery in Australia, so how are your comments relevant? Morrison: You would also understand that this process can begin in adolescence. Would you know that. You would know that the process of discussions about gender and gender reassignment – the surgical procedure can’t, but the process, the process by which these discussions commence and when issues of gender are being discussed with adolescents, that’s when the process can commence. And these are issues that I have no doubt Australians are very concerned about. Parents are very concerned about it. They should be dealt with sensitively. I deal with them sensitively and my government will deal with them sensitively. Updated at 12.22am BST 12.12am BST Q: Minors can’t undergo that surgery in Australia. Only people aged 18 and over according to your own health website. It can’t happen to minors in Australia. Scott Morrison: Even at any other stage, this is serious change. It is irreversible change. Q: Prime Minister, do you agree with her comments? That’s not a phrase I would use ... and isn’t a phrase any prime minister would use. I’m just simply saying that this is a significant surgical procedure that completely changes someone’s life, and it should never be entered into lightly, and it should never be entered into without a full appreciation of the irreversible changes. This is what the the health department recommends: Gender confirmation surgery is not for everyone. Many people are comfortable to live with gender dysphoria or to have hormone therapy only. Choosing gender confirmation surgery is a big decision. It’s almost impossible to reverse. There are international guidelines covering gender confirmation surgery. Before you have surgery, the guidelines say you must have: – gender dysphoria that has gone on for some time – be able to make a fully informed decision and give consent – be over 18 – have any physical or mental health problems well controlled – have been taking hormones for 12 months continuously, if they are recommended for you – have lived for 12 months continuously as the gender that is the same as your gender identity Counselling is usually recommended for anyone consider gender confirmation surgery. As with any surgery, there are risks involved including bleeding, infections, blood clots, damaged tissue and changes in feeling in the skin. Afterwards, some patients have problems going to the toilet or achieving sexual pleasure and/or orgasm. For people with gender dysphoria, gender confirmation surgery is medically necessary and almost always results in them feeling satisfied and happy after their surgery. However, gender confirmation surgery can only do so much. You might not be pleased with how you look after surgery. The procedure does not resolve gender dysphoria in everyone. Updated at 12.25am BST 12.07am BST Scott Morrison stands by Katherine Deves and wrongly claims young adolescents can have gender confirmation surgery Scott Morrison has moved on from saying the issue Katherine Deves was talking about was women in sport, to “gender reversal surgery”. Q: You previously defended Katherine Deve’s controversial comments on transgender teenagers saying she’d apologised and withdrawn them. Now she’s walked that back, do you stand by her? Morrison: Yes I do ... we’re talking about gender reversal surgery for young adolescents [note: in Australia, minors cannot have the surgery] and we can’t pretend this is not a serious, significant issue. It is. It’s complicated and the issues that have to be considered, first and foremost in the welfare of the adolescent child and their parents, and their parents – we can’t pretend that this type of surgery is some minor procedure. This is a very significant change to a young person’s life and it is often irreversible. And I think ensuring that we understand what we’re dealing with here is incredibly important. And that’s why our government and also state governments are so focused on ensuring that we get the right supports, counselling, psychiatric supports, but ultimately the supports for the parents and the family to make the best possible decision. Now I, and I’m sure many other Australians, are concerned. This is a concerning issue. It’s a troubling issue and for us to pretend it’s a minor procedure – it’s not. It is extremely significant and it changes that young adolescent’s life forever. And so I think it’s really important that we are very sensitive about those issues. I think it’s very important we’re sensitive about these issues. Again – you cannot get the surgery Scott Morrison is talking about if you are under 18 in Australia.

As we come out of this pandemic, and as Australia economy is performing more strongly, the advanced economies in the world, our unemployment falling, our triple A credit rating intact, that means Australia can secure the opportunities ahead of us, because we made the wise decisions during the pandemic to back in those apprenticeships with strong trade policies to ensure that Australian companies had the people they need to now go and seize the opportunities that are ahead of them.

That’s what the government’s bill did. It had their own members, particularly in some of the inner-city seats saying they couldn’t support it.

Meanwhile, the Office of the Special Investigator is considering further allegations of war crimes against Australian defence force personnel allegedly committed in Afghanistan, in addition to the matters specifically referred to it for investigation by the Brereton inquiry, a letter tabled in parliament shows. The former defence minister, Linda Reynolds, established an oversight panel in late 2020 to give the Australian community confidence the ADF was putting in place lasting cultural reforms. She promised to report “regularly to the parliament on their reports to me”. But Dutton, who took over as minister in late March 2021, has never spoken about the Brereton reforms in parliament, even though the number of reports from the panel is growing.

I don’t know why you would go into politics if you don’t want to leave a legacy. I spoke about my legacy in my first term. First speech to parliament. That’s what people do and then they then they work on it. My first speech was about nation building and infrastructure. It’s about greater equality. ...

I want to talk about women’s equality. I want to talk about First Nations recognition in our constitution with an enshrined voice to parliament. I want to build new industries through the national reconstruction fund. I want to make more things here, I want to act on climate change.

This is a very generous offer of First Nations people they had their hand out in friendship. It’s a generous statement. It’s a wonderful statement. And the idea that we don’t recognise that Australian history didn’t begin when the first fleet arrived, that we should be proud of our 65,000 years at least, of having the oldest continuous civilisation the plant on the planet that should be recognised in our constitution. Now we do want obviously for it to be successful. And just as I offered, I offered the prime minister in the first meeting that we had after I became Labor leader. I said this should be a priority. We should get this done. I would expect that if we’re successful, I’ll reach out across the parliament to ensure that there’s as much support as it needs to be of course on a bipartisan basis for this change. Updated at 10.58pm BST 10.45pm BST Anthony Albanese is asked whether or not he supports the ACTU’s submission to the Fair Work Commission for a 5.5% increase to the minimum wage, but won’t give a yes or no answer. The 5.5% is higher, of course than the inflation rate. What I say is that people can’t afford to go backwards. The current minimum wage is just $20.33. Asked again, he says: I’ve said the people the Fair Work Commission, in my view, should not allow people to go backwards. People are really struggling out there. And the idea that people’s minimum wage can’t keep up with the cost of living in terms of inflation, is in my view, something that the Fair Work Commission should bear in mind. Updated at 10.59pm BST 10.42pm BST Anthony Albanese is speaking to ABC radio RN for the first time this campaign. He is asked about Clive Palmer’s suggested preference flows against Labor in key seats the opposition needs to win if it is to win the election. We are we’re not completely shocked by that. But what we will do is continue to seek out people’s first preference at this election, including in those key seats, but there are seats right around the country, people’s vote [is very powerful] every individual’s vote is powerful. Sarah Martin has covered off that preference suggested story there: Related: United Australia party directs preferences to Coalition in key marginal seats 10.39pm BST (cont from previous post) Over 450 people filled Avalon theatre to hear from five of the Mackellar candidates in a forum that was chaired by ABC presenter Geraldine Doogue, who promised (and delivered) a far more orderly debate than the Nine Network leaders’ debate on Sunday night. The event, organised by Avalon bookshop Bookoccino, was the first time Scamps and Falinski had faced off in person. Scamps specifically ruled out supporting a wealth tax in response to an audience interjection and accused Falinski of putting “words in her mouth” and “feeding on fear” when he asked whether she would back the taxes proposed by economist Richard Denniss, if Labor won. In a sometimes testy exchange, she said “small business” was the backbone of the electorate, and that her policy choices would support small business and wage increases. But Scamps seemed to not understand Falinski’s question about whether she would guarantee confidence and supply for the party who formed government in the event of a minority government. She eventually said she would guarantee both. Falinski, who chaired a recent parliamentary inquiry into housing costs in Australia and named it as a priority, came under pressure from Doogue who asked him what he would actually do about the problem. He ruled out changes to capital gains tax and scrapping negative gearing, saying favourable tax treatment for housing accounted for 4% of the rise in housing cost. He warned ending negative gearing for mum and dad investors would result in Australia ending up with thousands of houses being owned by corporations as had occurred n Berlin. He said the biggest shifts could come from increasing supply of housing through densification, more efficient planning system and land releases. He proposed negotiations with the states similar to the national competition framework where federal funding would be withheld unless progress was made. But all five participants seemed reluctant to support, or clearly opposed greater densities and fewer environmental controls in Mackellar, one of the least densely populated areas of Sydney. The surprise star performer of the evening was the Greens’ candidate, 18-year old Ethan Hrnjak, who said the Greens were the only party advocating a 75% cut in emissions by 2030 – the number the IPCC said in its last report was needed to ensure global heating was kept to 1.5C. He received rousing applause for his case for action as well as his advocacy for more spending on mental health. Updated at 10.52pm BST 10.37pm BST Independent candidate Sophie Scamps and Liberal MP Jason Falinski face off in Mackellar Independent candidate for Mackellar, Sophie Scamps, has faced a barrage of questions about who she would support and how she would vote on key issues such as tax if she wins the seat of Mackellar on Sydney northern beaches in 10 days time. Scamps, who insists she will will make up her own mind after consultation with people in Mackellar, came under fire from her main rival, Liberal MP Jason Falinski, who warned that community independents were “an artifice” and were being funded by “ dark money” from a group of millionaires out of Sydney and Melbourne. Scamps replied that taking the funding from Climate 200 was necessary to match the power of the parties, and that 10,000 people had donated to the group set up by Simon Holmes à Court because they were deeply concerned about the Liberals’ failure on climate change. The two bickered over how much was being spent – she said $1.2m and he said $2m – a figure he labelled as “an unprecedented spend in a single seat.” Scamps said that she would wait to see what the major parties offered but the independents did not intend to act as a bloc, setting the stage for protracted negotiations if neither party has a majority.

I’m not sure any of us could handle much more. Scott Morrison’s handpicked candidate for Warringah, Katherine Deves, has backtracked on her apology for her previous social media comments (some as recent as earlier this year) in an interview with Sky News. Chris Kenny: So when you said that the gender reassignment surgery for teenagers was mutilation, that was inappropriate?’ Katherine Deves: Look, that is actually the correct medico legal term. Look, it’s very emotive and it’s very confronting, and it’s very ugly. So of course, people are going to be offended. But when you look at medical negligence cases, that is the terminology that they use. It is also contained in the Crimes Act of New South Wales. So was she apologising? Well, I’m apologising for how people might have perceived it, and the fact that it is confronting and it is ugly, and I certainly don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. But that is the correct terminology. Deves says she is speaking for the “quiet Australians”. Labor’s Catherine King was asked on ABC this morning if she was surprised Deves had walked back her apology. No, I think this is an incredibly divisive debate and I think the prime minister has chosen a very divisive candidate to run in that seat and I think it’s really awful to see that happening in the context of a federal election campaign. Meanwhile, aged care staff are planning to go on strike today, protesting low pay and conditions. Thousands of staff are planning to walk off the job across the nation, in action which was flagged last month. The union is calling for at least a 25% pay rise. King says Labor backs the pay rise: A couple of things we have said, this is a damning indictment on the government. How can you have a royal commission where its interim report titled Neglect tells you there’s a problem with residential aged care and basically do nothing about it? We said 24-7 nursing staff, minimum times for people to – for workers to be with residents, again, that basically brings in more staff into residential aged care and we have said we’ll make a submission to the Fair Work Commission in relation to the waged case. Scott Morrison is in Sydney, while Anthony Albanese is in Melbourne, where he is expected to campaign with Daniel Andrews. Given there is less than two weeks in the campaign now, where the campaigns go tells you where the seats are to be won. It’s only going to rev up. As usual, you will have Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp, Daniel Hurst, Sarah Martin and Josh Butler to help you make sense of it, and a very caffeinated Amy Remeikis on the blog. Ready?

Related: Danger and deja vu: what 2011 can tell us about the US debt ceiling crisis The hearing came a week after House Republicans narrowly passed the Limit, Save, Grow Act to raise the debt ceiling until May 2024. The legislation, championed by the House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, would also roll back federal discretionary spending to 2022 levels and cap annual increases at 1%. Mocking the bill as the “Default on America Act”, Democrats warned that the legislation would result in devastating cuts to veterans’ benefits, childcare access and infrastructure funding. “Republicans’ dangerous bill proposes a terrible choice: default on our financial obligations, causing widespread pain and wrecking our economy, or gut basic federal programs essential to our economic strength, causing widespread pain and wrecking our economy,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, the Democratic chair of the Senate budget committee. “It is a false and unnecessary choice.” Republicans on the committee countered that the House bill should be interpreted as an “opening bid” to kickstart negotiations with Joe Biden, who has repeatedly called on Congress to pass a “clean” bill raising the debt ceiling without any strings attached. Biden has invited the top four congressional leaders to a meeting at the White House next week to discuss the debt ceiling. “I hope when the president sits down with the speaker, he will bring an open mind and a serious counteroffer,” said Senator Chuck Grassley, the Republican ranking member of the budget committee. “The longer the president spends dragging his feet and putting off negotiations, the closer President Biden brings us to the first ever federal default in US history.” Three economists testified to the committee that a default would prove calamitous for the country and global markets, causing America’s unemployment rate to rise and its gross domestic product (GDP) to tumble. Dr Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, predicted a “severe recession” in the US if lawmakers do not address the debt ceiling. The treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, sent a letter to congressional leaders on Monday informing them that the US government would be unable to cover its financial obligations as early as 1 June. Zandi added that this moment is “an especially inopportune time to have a political debate over the debt limit” because the current risk of an American recession is “uncomfortably high”. That risk heightens the danger of enacting House Republicans’ bill, Zandi argued. “It entails significant cuts to government spending … right at the point in time when the economy is going to be most vulnerable to going into recession,” Zandi said. But all three economists also agreed that the “unsustainable” trajectory of America’s debt must be met with urgency by policymakers. “We are sitting on a ticking timebomb,” said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the conservative thinktank Manhattan Institute. “Congress should be working diligently to avert an otherwise inevitable debt crisis, and raising the debt limit has historically been one opportunity to address the underlying debt problem.” Senators JD Vance, John Barrasso and Rick Scott walk to a press conference to call on Joe Biden to negotiate with Republicans on the debt ceiling. Photograph: Craig Hudson/Reuters Democrats expressed openness to amending the federal budget for the next fiscal year, which begins in October, but they emphasized that such a discussion must be separated from the immediate need to address the debt ceiling. “If we want to have a real discussion about revenues and spending, that’s great,” said Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Democratic member of the committee. “Don’t default. But let’s have that debate about what’s fair for the majority of American people.” Biden has similarly invited a bipartisan conversation on budgetary reform, but he has steadfastly rejected Republican efforts to tie the debt ceiling to government spending negotiations. “America is not a deadbeat nation,” Biden said on Monday. “We pay our bills, and we should do so without reckless hostage-taking from some of the [‘Make America Great Again’] Republicans in Congress.” Whitehouse noted Senate Democrats have introduced a two-page bill raising the debt ceiling until December 2024, ensuring the issue would not be revisited until after the next presidential election, but such a bill seems unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled House. Democrats in the House have simultaneously launched a long-shot bid to pass a clean debt ceiling bill through the lower chamber, but the odds of five of their Republican colleagues joining that effort seem slim to none. As the clock ticks down, lawmakers are running out of time to avoid catastrophe, Zandi testified. “We are on a certain unsustainable fiscal path. We need both additional tax revenue and we need spending restraint. Both of those things need to happen. But we can’t do that in the current environment,” Zandi told senators. “This is not the time to do it. We need to end this drama as quickly as possible.”","Id":"us-news/2023/may/04/debt-ceiling-senate-democrats-republicans","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"Senate Democrats highlight ‘terrible choice’ of Republicans’ debt ceiling plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/04/debt-ceiling-senate-democrats-republicans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/04/debt-ceiling-senate-democrats-republicans","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":798,"webPublicationDate":"2023-05-04T18:28:45Z","hosted":false,"id":"us-news/2023/may/04/debt-ceiling-senate-democrats-republicans"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Terrible week for Sunak and Hunt puts election victory all but out of reach","body":"There was only ever an outside chance that the Conservatives would win the next general election after the tumultuous period that resulted in Rishi Sunak becoming prime minister last October. The events of the past week mean the prospect of a fifth Tory victory is now vanishingly small. Ironically, things started so well for the government. On Tuesday, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, luxuriated in the praise bestowed on the UK from the International Monetary Fund as it upgraded its growth forecasts for the economy. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, came bearing three gifts. She said the fund was no longer predicting a recession for the UK this year; she confirmed that the UK would no longer be the worst-performing country in the G7; and she praised Hunt for his handling of the economy. With the following day’s figures for the cost of living expected to show a sharp drop in the annual inflation rate, a narrow path to victory for Sunak and Hunt was just about discernible. Optimism lasted less than 24 hours. At 7am on Wednesday the Office for National Statistics published figures showing that while inflation had indeed fallen, it had not dropped by nearly as much as the financial markets had been anticipating. Even worse, core inflation – a cost of living measure that excludes items such as food and fuel – rose. Previously, the City had thought that interest rates were at or close to a peak. Twelve successive increases have taken the official cost of borrowing from 0.1% to 4.5% and the markets were split between those who thought the Bank of England would leave them unchanged and those who thought one more quarter-point rise would be deemed necessary to bring inflation back to its 2% target. The mood has now changed. As far as the markets are concerned, the peak in interest rates will not be 4.5% or 4.75% but 5.5%. In an echo of last autumn’s turmoil, the yield (or interest rate) on government bonds rose to reflect the worse-than-expected inflation news. Bond yields affect the cost of servicing mortgages, and lenders responded by raising home-loan rates and pulling some products from the market. This is all terrible news for Hunt and Sunak. The chancellor said he would support any anti-inflationary action the Bank’s monetary policy committee may need to take even if it meant a recession. Even so, Hunt will be fully aware of the dangers – both economic and political – of interest rates being kept higher for longer, and he has every reason to be hopping mad with Threadneedle Street. There are two things every student of economics knows about monetary policy: it takes time to have an effect and it is a blunt instrument. The art of setting interest rates is to be ahead of the game: to raise rates before inflationary pressure starts to appear and to cut them before the economy weakens by too much. Having been slow to tighten policy, there is now a strong risk that the Bank will be guilty of overkill and be too slow to loosen. Yes, the Bank can squeeze inflation out of the economy but only by weakening the economy and pushing up unemployment. The UK narrowly avoided recession in the winter just past; it may not be so lucky in the winter to come. Related: Rishi Sunak warned over possible UK recession in 2024 The resilience of the economy over the past six months has been due to a number of factors: oil and gas prices have fallen, some of the excess savings built up when spending opportunities were limited during the pandemic have been drawn down; the government has subsidised energy bills; and mortgage rates have dropped. A higher population due to net migration has also helped to boost growth. Hunt was hoping that the continuation of this better news on the economy would eat into Labour’s healthy opinion polls lead. If, so the thinking went, by the time of the next election inflation was markedly lower and wages were rising faster than prices, then the Conservatives would have a narrative to sell, even if not a stunningly persuasive one. With inflation still high, Downing Street is now reportedly drawing up plans for retailers to introduce voluntary price caps on basic food items such as bread and milk to help tackle the rising cost of living, according to the Sunday Telegraph. Sitting governments can play it one of two ways on the economy. In good times they ask the question Ronald Reagan put in his presidential debate with Jimmy Carter in 1980: do you feel better off than you did last time you voted? When the answer is yes, as it was for the Tories in 1987 and as it was for Labour in 2001, the opposition struggles to get a hearing. But Hunt knows that voters are not going to be better off by the time of the next election – no matter how long it is delayed – than they were in December 2019. He hopes the Reagan question will not be relevant at the next election, although that is almost certainly wishful thinking. Labour will be asking voters whether they feel better off not just over the past five years but over a period of Tory rule stretching back to 2010. Hunt’s back-up plan involves focusing on the economy’s better performance under his stewardship and to ask voters a different question: given the job I have done since taking over from Kwasi Kwarteng, which party do you think will make you better off over the next five years? This is obviously a weaker pitch but it has worked for the Conservatives in the past, most notably when John Major won in 1992. Polling day is still a long way off and only a fool would write off the Tories completely. That said, last week felt decisive. For Sunak and Hunt to grab victory from the jaws of defeat everything has to go right for the economy. Clearly, everything is not going right.","Id":"business/2023/may/28/terrible-week-sunak-hunt-election-victory-reach","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webTitle":"Terrible news for Sunak and Hunt puts election victory all but out of reach | Larry Elliott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/28/terrible-week-sunak-hunt-election-victory-reach","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/28/terrible-week-sunak-hunt-election-victory-reach","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":993,"webPublicationDate":"2023-05-28T09:12:17Z","hosted":false,"id":"business/2023/may/28/terrible-week-sunak-hunt-election-victory-reach"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Labour will be most interventionist government for a generation, says shadow minister","body":"The British public is yet to understand “the scale of Labour’s ambition on the economy”, one of Keir Starmer’s most senior shadow ministers has said, adding that the party needs to explain how it will be the most interventionist government for a generation. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, said that the party had not yet fully communicated the “sum of its parts” in terms of how a series of technical policy fixes would translate into the ambitious transformation of the economy that the party will attempt to achieve. In an interview with the Observer, Reynolds said he believed Labour was now the “party of business” and invited any industrial leaders to meet him and “kick the tyres” on its commitment to turning around the economy. He said that Labour’s pro-business drive was completely different from the “prawn cocktail offensive” under Tony Blair, as businesses now wanted reassurances that Labour would change the way the economy was managed rather than reassurance that they would stick with the approach of their predecessors. He conceded, however, that the shadow cabinet now needed to use the 18 months before the next election to explain how Labour will be more interventionist than both the previous Tory and New Labour governments to revive the economy. He said the process had begun with Starmer’s “mission” to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7. “Where we are now is at a level of public support and business support which I’m not sure many people thought we could have delivered in the aftermath of 2019 on this timescale,” Reynolds said. “One thing we’ve struggled with, in my view, is that we’ve got a lot of very good policy that maybe hasn’t yet described the sum of its parts. In other words, I think what Keir’s missions do, especially the mission on the economy, is to take a lot of existing policies and explain them in a way that comes across with a degree of ambition I think we need, and that we can add to over the next 18 months to help deliver. “I feel people do not yet understand the scale of Labour’s ambition on the economy. I think we’ve got some components in place, which represent a very different approach to the economy from what we’ve seen , not just from the Tories but actually from the last Labour government. To deliver things like net zero, you have to have a more active state. “As it stands, people maybe don’t appreciate that to the same degree that those of us inside the shadow cabinet do. But be in no doubt that we are talking about an economy that will deliver for working people to a much greater extent.” Reynolds also said that Labour could achieve “significant improvements” to the post-Brexit relationship with the EU, and rejected suggestions that Labour lacked political courage in talking about the problems Brexit had created. He declined to say that he believed Rishi Sunak doesn’t think paedophiles should be jailed – a controversial claim made in a Labour attack ad. However, he backed the campaign’s attempt to hold Sunak to account for the Tory record in government. “It’s important that Rishi Sunak is held accountable for the last 13 years of Conservative government,” he said. “That’s what the campaign does, and I do think that is fair. I will always say I think civility is important in politics. My natural comfort zone would be a debate in detail on the issue or policy area. But accountability is important as well.” Reynolds also announced that Labour will tackle the issue of late payment, which sees smaller companies left unpaid by bigger businesses for months on end. The issue has been a problem for decades. However, he said Labour’s plan would finally tackle the issue by forcing big companies to reveal how quickly they are paying suppliers as part of their annual reports. New analysis by Labour of official data found that more than 1m businesses across the UK saw the number of unpaid invoices from customers increase over the last six months. The figures are based on a business survey by the Office for National Statistics.","Id":"politics/2023/apr/15/labour-party-economic-ambitions-interventionist-jonathan-reynolds","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Labour will be most interventionist government for a generation, says shadow minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/15/labour-party-economic-ambitions-interventionist-jonathan-reynolds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/apr/15/labour-party-economic-ambitions-interventionist-jonathan-reynolds","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":694,"webPublicationDate":"2023-04-15T14:22:40Z","hosted":false,"id":"politics/2023/apr/15/labour-party-economic-ambitions-interventionist-jonathan-reynolds"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Barack Obama to campaign for Mandela Barnes in Wisconsin Senate race","body":"Barack Obama, who twice won Wisconsin by large margins, will travel to the battleground state in the final weeks of the current midterm elections, seeking to boost Mandela Barnes, the young lieutenant governor looking to unseat the Republican Ron Johnson in a key US Senate contest. Barnes would be the first Black senator from Wisconsin. He held early leads over Johnson but the Republican, a prominent figure on the GOP hard right, has surged back. This week, a Marquette University Law School poll showed Johnson in the lead. Related: Herschel Walker denies abortion ban support and brandishes ‘police badge’ in Georgia debate Barnes, who is from Milwaukee, has been trying to energize Black voters in a contest that could decide control of the Senate, which is currently split 50-50 and controlled by Democrats through the vote of the vice-president, Kamala Harris. Obama, the first Black US president, is set to hold an early voting event on 29 October, less than two weeks before election day, in Milwaukee, the largest city in Wisconsin and home to its largest group of African American voters. Politico reported this week that the Barnes campaign was reaching out to high-profile Democrats, seeking support as he slips in the polls. Joe Biden, Harris and Bernie Sanders were also named as potential guests. Since his first run for the Senate in 2010, Johnson has marketed himself as a successful businessman upholding conservative values. But he has leaned heavily into rightwing conspiracy theories around the 2020 presidential election and Covid-19 vaccines and remedies. In turn, his approval rating has dropped to 45%, the second-lowest for a Republican senator. In a recent editorial, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the largest newspaper in the state, called Johnson “the worst Wisconsin representative since the infamous Joseph McCarthy” and reminded readers he promised to serve no more than two terms, which he has now completed. “Voters should hold him to that pledge in November,” the newspaper said. But Johnson’s campaign has been gaining steam. Early polls showed Barnes with a slight edge but Johnson has launched an intense negative ad campaign, attempting to portray Barnes as bad for the economy in a time of high inflation and as a supporter for activists who want to defund police departments. The lieutenant governor has not backed such campaigns. At a heated debate last Thursday, Johnson, when asked to say something nice about his opponent, said that Barnes had loving parents and added: “What puzzles me about that is with that upbringing, why has he turned against America?” Wisconsin has long been a swing state. After voting for Obama twice, Donald Trump beat Hilary Clinton in 2016 by less than one point. Biden won with a similarly small margin four years later. The state is home to more tight races this midterm season, including the Democratic governor, Tony Evers, being challenged by Tim Michels, a construction company co-owner endorsed by Trump. Marquette polls have for months shown that race to be about even. Tammy Baldwin, the state’s other US senator, and Gwen Moore, a congresswoman who represents Milwaukee, are also slated to appear with Democratic candidates for office, including the serving attorney general, Josh Kaul.","Id":"us-news/2022/oct/15/barack-obama-mandela-barnes-wisconsin-senate","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"Barack Obama to campaign for Mandela Barnes in Wisconsin Senate race","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/15/barack-obama-mandela-barnes-wisconsin-senate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/oct/15/barack-obama-mandela-barnes-wisconsin-senate","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":515,"webPublicationDate":"2022-10-15T16:02:28Z","hosted":false,"id":"us-news/2022/oct/15/barack-obama-mandela-barnes-wisconsin-senate"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Energy bill passes – as it happened","body":"7.41am GMT What we learned: Thursday, 15 December With that, we will wrap the blog for the evening. You won’t see Amy Remeikis until the new year but we’ll be back first thing tomorrow to bring you all the latest. Here were the major developments of the day: The Senate has passed Labor’s energy legislation with 28 ayes and 22 noes during a special sitting of federal parliament. It will now adjourn until 6 February. The bill, capping gas prices and funding consumer rebates to deliver power price relief made it through despite the Coalition voting against the proposal. Still in Canberra, Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton offered an emotional tribute to the Queensland shooting victims. There was absolute silence in the house for the condolence motion. The president of Palau has signalled that his country is not likely to switch its diplomatic relations from Taiwan to China, despite several Pacific leaders making the switch in recent years. The ACT can claim bragging rights as the jurisdiction with the lowest unemployment rate. Last month it sank to 2.9% in trend terms from 3.1% in October, the ABS has confirmed. And the opposition’s Senate leader, Simon Birmingham, has conceded during a visit to the Pacific that Australia should have strengthened its 2030 emissions reduction target sooner than it did. Updated at 7.46am GMT 7.18am GMT Peta has released a statement following the Melbourne Cup-winning horse trainer Darren Weir admitting to three charges of animal cruelty yesterday, including using an electric prod on horses in 2018. Darren Weir’s admission that he used an electric cattle prod on three horses should shock racegoers into staying far away from the track. Horse racing encourages cruelty because it’s a profit-dominated industry in which the horses’ needs are too often an afterthought. During the last racing year, 139 horses died on tracks, in addition to those who were sent to slaughterhouses because they weren’t fast enough.

AWU national secretary Daniel Walton: Here’s my prediction for what will happen as a result of this apparently terrifying new legislation: the price of gas and coal will fall, consumers will feel relief, and the manufacturing industry will gain the confidence to keep operating and investing in Australia. The multinational energy exporters, who are currently hyperventilating and feeding the opposition talking points, will continue to make massive profits. The world will keep turning. Australia’s orderly transition to a clean energy future will continue. Those out there hyperventilating about ‘a war on gas exporters’ and ‘Marxism’ and whatever other nonsense they’ve pumped into the media this week will pull their heads in as they’re forced to acknowledge the embarrassing size of their profits.

Updated at 6.13am GMT 6.05am GMT Amy's handover for the day Just PMO having a little joke there about press conferences when they should know NOW IS NOT THE TIME WE HAVE NO BRAIN POWER LEFT. Ahem. We have made it to the end of the special additional session, called to pass the extraordinary energy intervention bill in what are pretty extraordinary times in the energy space. But the Guardian will not be resting – Murph, who is the best person you could learn from when it comes to these issues, is already at work on her weekend column (the last for the year, so make sure you catch it) as well as helping you make sense of everything which just went down. Josh Butler and Daniel Hurst have all the news you could want and the rest of the Guardian team have been busy, as always, covering everything not happening in this building on the hill. I’ll be putting my general political news hat back on and leaving the blogging to the daily news experts – Natasha May and co will be back with you tomorrow morning. Caitlin Cassidy will take you through the evening, so a big thank you to her. And a very big thank you, as always, from me to Mike Bowers for all he does to keep everything rolling along smoothly.

A Senator – I think Liberal Jonno Duniam (originally Jonathon, now Jonno) from Tasmania – is now on his feet complaining about the bill. He says the test will be whether power bills are up or down. He says they will be up. Which is true. They will be. No one is arguing that? The government argues they won’t be up by as much and the Australian energy regulator has said power prices are already coming down after the government began talking about intervention in October. Clare Savage said in NSW and Queensland, the regulator is already seeing prices come down by 40-50%. Updated at 5.42am GMT 5.18am GMT Amendment calling for Medicare psychology session cuts to be reversed succeeds There was one amendment agreed to by the Senate, as moved by the Liberal senator Anne Rushton: But the Senate: (a) notes that, the Government has prioritised this bill, at the same time it has halved the number of Medicare subsidised psychology sessions at a time when Australians are facing natural disasters, cost of living pressures and household energy bills are skyrocketing; and (b) calls on the Government to reverse the cuts to these sessions until such time as Australians have adequate access to Medicare subsidised psychology sessions. It is a symbolic amendment – it doesn’t change the bill though Updated at 5.27am GMT 5.14am GMT Most second reading amendments defeated Ok, all amendments there having been defeated, we are now moving on to the second reading division (which is one step away from the third reading). There won’t be a problem with the passage here. Updated at 5.21am GMT 5.08am GMT There are two further lots of second reading amendments (the Senate is motoring through these). Updated at 5.10am GMT 4.59am GMT So the Senate is dividing on the second reading of amendments – I don’t think the government are supporting too many of these, and they appear to be going through as a group, so it won’t take too long. In theory. Updated at 5.06am GMT 4.58am GMT The Senate has reached the point of dividing on the bill. Updated at 5.06am GMT 4.48am GMT Gallagher finishes up debate in the Senate Katy Gallagher is now wrapping up the debate in the Senate. She says the government senators did not speak on the bill to allow as many non-government MPs as possible to make their contributions in the short time frame set for debate. A gag order was put on the debate to get it done in a set period of time, so it can return the bill to the house, and then everyone can go home. Updated at 4.54am GMT 4.45am GMT Canavan opposes energy plan Matt Canavan is now on his feet and feeling very passionately about not supporting the energy bill. “This is a new opposition in this chamber today,” he says. It looks like the same opposition, but anyways. Canavan says the opposition will not “cease, we will not rest until we get justice for the Australian people”. Canavan says while Labor will “win today”, they won’t let the government win in the future and will set up inquiries and everything else it can to hold the government to account. Katy Gallagher looks tired. Updated at 4.47am GMT 4.39am GMT Covid taskforce seeks alternative funding to continue work Earlier this week the national Covid-19 clinical evidence taskforce was told by the federal health department that it would not be funded from next year. A collaboration of 35 health organisations, the taskforce was formed to continuously and rapidly look at the data and research emerging about Covid-19 to provide national, evidence-based clinical guidelines to make sure patients received the best care. Hundreds of clinicians worked together to make more than 200 recommendations for managing mild, moderate, severe and critical disease. Taskforce members also developed guidelines for people after they recovered, and for those with long Covid. The guidance from the taskforce also meant specific groups were examined and given evidence-based advice, including children and pregnant women. Because of the taskforce, health workers had the latest information about how to care for those with Covid, including vulnerable populations. There is still a lot that is unknown or little understood about Covid and new research is frequently emerging, making translation of this research into care guidelines critical. The taskforce is now seeking alternative funding sources so it can keep doing this work. It said in a statement: We believe up-to-date guidance to support clinicians caring for people with Covid-19 continues to be vital, especially at a time of rising cases and increasing pressure across the health system. Updated at 4.44am GMT 4.22am GMT Meanwhile in the Senate, Bridget McKenzie says that Chris Bowen and Adam Bandt will be knocking on your door with their spanners in hand to take away your gas cooktops, gas BBQs and the BBQ canister you have in your garage. She then refers to what the government is doing as “institutional gaslighting” and accuses the Greens of being socialists. So just having a normal one then.

Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian Updated at 4.31am GMT 4.00am GMT Key event Palau president suggests diplomatic switch from Taipei to Beijing unlikely The president of Palau has signalled that his country is not likely to switch its diplomatic relations from Taiwan to China, despite several Pacific leaders making the switch in recent years. During a press conference alongside visiting Australian politicians, Surangel Whipps said Palau had been “very consistent that we are friends to all and enemies to none”. He said China had put pressure on Palau to end its diplomatic relationship with Taiwan by restricting tourist numbers. What we’ve told China is that, as friends, you shouldn’t tell your friends who their friends can be. And so we’ve made a very clear statement that we have diplomatic relations with the Republic of China [Taiwan]. And if you want to be our friend, they’re our friend also. But you’re not going to tell us we can’t be their friend, which is what they want to tell us to do. And that’s why they say, you know, we can give you all the tourists you want, just switch, and we say, that’s OK. That’s what they’ve done – they’ve turned off the faucet [to] play games with us. But I don’t think that’s the way you treat true friendship and true partnership … nobody else should tell us that we should dissolve that relationship. Whipps also backed calls for Taiwan to be allowed to participate in international events, such as UN climate talks and World Health Organisation talks. He said the 23 million people who lived in Taiwan “need a voice”. Palau’s President Surangel Whipps earlier this year. Photograph: Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty Images At the same press conference, the Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, cautiously backed the calls for Taiwan to have input into problems that require global solutions (while also restating Australia’s bipartisan position that it has diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China but unofficial engagement with Taiwan). She said: Every country makes its own sovereign decisions about recognition and so forth. I think President Whipps answered the previous question very clearly on that front. In relation to Taiwan, obviously, the bipartisan position we have is a ‘one-China’ policy. But what that means is we will continue our unofficial people to people, economic, relationships and engagement with Taiwan. And I make this observation – and obviously these matters have to be worked through in the WHO, or through the Conference of the Parties or whatever fora: you’re talking about problems here which require the whole world to resolve them. So whether it’s Covid or climate, we need everybody to be part of the solution. So we want to work through how that can occur in those forums. But I think the reality is they are issues that require the whole of the world to tackle them. Updated at 4.12am GMT 3.55am GMT PM ‘hopeful’ Indigenous voice will be voted in Does Anthony Albanese think the voice referendum will be able to pass given it doesn’t have bipartisan support (the Nationals have said they will not be supporting it)? Well, I’m very hopeful that Australians, who are optimistic Australians, who are generous, will accept this gracious offer of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. There were five years spent in the lead-up to the Uluru statement coming out in 2017. Five years of extensive consultation since then, which been another five years in which we know, for example, that Ken Wyatt, the former minister in the Morrison government, took on two occasions a more than 200-page document about the structure and operation of the voice to the Morrison cabinet. So there’s been a lot of discussion, a lot of detail to make sure that this has got it right, but essentially it will do just two things. One it will recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in our constitution, which is important. And secondly, it will say that when issues affect directly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, they should be consulted. And we know that that will have a practical impact because when you consult people about issues that affect them about their education, their health, their housing, their life expectancy, justice issues, then you’ll get better outcomes; if you’re consulting, rather than just seeking to impose things on any section of society. Updated at 4.02am GMT 3.48am GMT Asked if he would consider going to Beijing next year, Anthony Albanese says he would of course examine any invitations which may come it. But he says there have been meetings at the leaders’ level, as well as foreign minister level and a meeting of defence ministers, pointing out that the lines of communication are once again open. Updated at 3.52am GMT 3.46am GMT Back to the prime minister, Anthony Albanese is asked about the Queensland shooting. Albanese says the nation will continue to mourn the two police officers and neighbour who were killed and the government will examine any recommendations which may come from the investigation into the shooting and siege. Updated at 3.51am GMT 3.44am GMT Sydney driver charged over allegedly using phone while child on lap Dipping out of politics again for a moment for this report from NSW police media: A woman has been charged after she was allegedly detected driving while holding a mobile phone, and with a small child seated on her lap in Sydney’s west. Earlier this month (Wednesday 7 December), Georges River traffic and highway patrol received a referral from Transport for NSW regarding an image taken on a mobile phone detection camera situated in Bankstown. The image allegedly depicted a female driver in a Queensland-registered motor vehicle holding a mobile phone with a small child seated on her lap, unrestrained, on Tuesday 1 November. Following inquiries, police attended Padstow about 7.30pm yesterday (Wednesday 14 December) and spoke with a 28-year-old woman, who holds a Queensland ‘learner’ licence. She was issued a field court attendance notice, where she was charged with five offences, including: Drive recklessly/furiously or speed/manner dangerous Driver use mobile phone when not permitted Drive with 6 months-4 years old not restrained as prescribed Learner not accompanied by driver/police officer/tester Driver not wear seatbelt properly adjusted/fastened The woman is due to appear before the Bankstown local court on Wednesday 25 January 2023. Updated at 3.49am GMT 3.43am GMT PM says balance right on energy package Sky News has just wrapped up an interview with Anthony Albanese. Albanese was talking about the energy legislation, which he says has got the balance right. He also says (to paraphrase the Mark Twain misquote) reports of the gas industry from this legislation is premature. Well, if you go there and you say ‘oh, this will inhibit investment, this will will create issues for for us going forward’, then you’re essentially talking down your industry and I see no reason there’s nothing in this legislation that should require that sort of compensation. We saw it before the Industrial Relations legislation, where some were out there saying it would immediately result in all this chaos and dysfunction.

Alison Frame, the current deputy secretary for social policy in prime minister and cabinet, has been appointed to the role and will start her five year tenure in January. Updated at 3.39am GMT 3.29am GMT Burke brushes aside opposition’s IR law complaints In his press release on the unemployment figures, Tony Burke doesn’t directly address Angus Taylor and Michaelia Cash, but he does sort of sub-tweet them. Or sub-press release. It’s hard to say. Taylor and Cash say the IR legislation passed by the government will lead to job losses. Burke says: The number of Australians in jobs remains at record highs and more of them are in secure full-time work – but there’s still more to do. New labour force figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) today show that total employment increased by 64,000 in November 2022. The unemployment rate remained steady at 3.4%, while the participation rate rose to an equal record high of 66.8%. The government welcomes the increase in both full-time employment and part-time employment, as well as the youth participation rate hitting its highest rate since 1990. While the historically low unemployment rate and high rates of participation are welcome news, we’re only just starting to see green shoots when it comes to wages growth. Due to a decade of deliberate wage stagnation under our predecessors and the rising cost of living, workers’ real wages are still going backwards, which is why our plan to fight inflation and get wages moving again is so important. This government believes in getting wages moving again – that’s why one of the first things we did after the election was help secure a pay rise for Australia’s lowest-paid workers. We backed up this commitment by supporting and securing a wage rise for aged care workers. The government Secure Jobs, Better Pay legislation will also help get wages moving. By modernising the bargaining system, we will see more workplace agreements, delivering better productivity and flexibility for employers and better pay and conditions for workers.

Before becoming a parliamentarian, this is what Dr Aly did – she was a counter-terrorism expert, who worked to pull people away from violent extremism. I think it’s worthy to also comment that this is a sad, very timely reminder about how vigilant we have to be about violent extremism and the rise of violent extremism in Australia, and how important it is that we are able to identify individuals who are down that path towards violent extremism who are becoming operative, and to intervene. Like many Australians, I’ve been reading the reports coming out and some of the coverage on the back stories of the perpetrators whose name shall not be spoken. And it’s very clear to me as somebody who was a professor in this field, and I studied this field, that their trajectories were very people have a trajectory to violent extremism. Human behaviour is actually quite predictable. There are warning signs. From the reports that I’ve read, there were warning signs, signs with these perpetrators. There are warning signs. We have to get better at recognising those warning signs. We have to get better at intervening early, we have to get better at early identification. We, all of us, have to take more seriously the warnings that our security agencies have been giving us about the rise of violent extremism in this country. Anne Aly in parliament last month.

I’m not jumping to a conclusion, saying this is what happened here. But I am seeing it on the rise and I know people in the police service, people … who work as magistrates tell me that there is a rise of this sort of misinformation. And I particularly, while in here in Canberra and this building, call out for politicians who harvest mistrust as part of their business model and go on Sky After Dark and dog whistle or dog trumpet these conspiracy theories and the shadowy conspiracy theory groups who are actually praising these killers of police officers and encouraging others to take up arms.

From his statement (with Michaelia Cash): The clear test for the Albanese government is to maintain the high number of Australians in work, as revealed in the latest Labour force figures. The figures saw the unemployment rate remain steady at 3.4%, a result of policies put in the place by the former Coalition government, which grew the economy and helped jobs to be created. Shadow treasurer Angus Taylor said today’s figures come on a day that Labor has rammed yet another appalling piece of legislation through the parliament that will cost jobs and provide uncertainty for businesses. Mr Taylor said: “Just as Labor’s toxic IR bill is bound to kill jobs, so too will its diabolical energy deal. “This is yet another piece of shambolic legislation dumped on the Coalition at five minutes to midnight that will destroy future gas supply and the jobs and businesses that depend on it. “Labor has struck a sweetheart deal with the Greens and has provided absolutely no detail on how much it will add to the budget bottom line. “Now is not the time for reckless spending. A responsible government should be tightening its budget belt to put a lid on inflation so that the Reserve Bank can take a break on raising interest rates. “It’s becoming clearer by the day that this is a party which had a plan to get elected but no plan to govern.” Updated at 2.53am GMT 2.25am GMT Chamber of commerce concerned over Labor’s energy plan The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has released its submission to the government on the energy package. You can find that here. ACCI chief of policy and advocacy David Alexander said the ACCI supported the targeted relief but wasn’t too crash hot on the market intervention. Business welcomes targeted price relief that government can provide in the face of soaring energy bills. However, we are greatly concerned about the market interventions set to pass parliament, as they risk reducing investment and exacerbating supply problems. While targeted relief will take the sting out of forecasted energy price increases, there is little detail over who will benefit from temporary assistance, and this won’t be settled with state and territory governments until March next year. We are concerned about the establishment of price caps because they reduce incentives for supply and investment and create larger problems over time. We are also concerned that the mandatory code of conduct in which the government determines ‘reasonable prices’ would be a significant impairment to the efficient operation of the market and would further deter future investment. For many years short-term ‘fixes’ by governments have created larger second-round problems – investment is deterred, supply is reduced and prices are higher than they would otherwise be. Price-capping is another policy that fits into this pattern. The government needs to prioritise getting the fundamental settings for energy policy right, as this is the only way to ensure affordable prices and secure supply while meeting emissions targets. Updated at 2.35am GMT 2.06am GMT The Senate has begun debating the energy legislation. That will take up the afternoon – there are quite a few amendments, but no one is in the mood to go too late with this. Updated at 2.07am GMT 1.59am GMT Peter Dutton finished with: I want to ... acknowledge the work of all of those who attended the scene: forensic officers, special emergency response team officers – those included the many police officers who will be scarred from this experience. By chance I returned from Toowoomba earlier this week. We came on to the highway to return from Toowoomba back to Brisbane and the motorcade was there and carrying the bodies of the officers and the highway blocked as they progressed down to Brisbane to the John Tonge Centre. It was a ... reminder of the good and the bravery that they displayed. Mr Speaker, I want to thank the prime minister for the condolence motion today. I want to say thank you to all of those that had provided support and comfort to the families involved; all of those that have attended police stations. There are many reports of local communities, particularly in western Queensland, that are running out of flowers, and the tributes will continue for some time to come. Our thoughts are obviously also with the officers of the Tara and Chinchilla police stations, but the Queensland police service more broadly, the Wieambilla community, represented by the leader of the Nationals here today. [It’s] particularly difficult as we head into Christmas, as we should all spare a thought and a prayer for those who have lost their lives, but for those who continue to serve over Christmas to keep us and our families safe. Updated at 2.17am GMT 1.58am GMT Peter Dutton: Australians have always been able to rely on those who wear the uniform at a state and federal level. They go into the line of fire and into danger zones so that we don’t have to. And I hope that the virtues displayed by constables McCrow, Arnold, Kirk and Brough, continue to inspire the next generation of police officers. Mr Speaker, I want to acknowledge the work of commissioner Katarina Carroll and her bravery and her leadership, her inspiration. Equally, I want to acknowledge the contributions and support of the Queensland Police Union, led by Ian Leavers, and the associations and the federation that do great work around the country in providing that day-to-day support, and the support in years to come. The depravity of this incident is what has struck hardest. On September 29, many of us went to police memorials around the country for the commemoration day to mark those who had lost their lives in the service of their state or the commonwealth. Every one of them a tragedy. But in this instance, what has hit hardest across the country is the execution-style and the complete disregard for the human beings that these officers were. The premeditated nature of the attack, the callous lack of heeding the pleas that … would have echoed in between the gunshots. An emotional Peter Dutton during the condolence motion for victims of the Queensland shooting. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian Updated at 2.18am GMT 1.57am GMT Peter Dutton: And for those many, of course, there will be much pain and sadness now and enduring. For those of us who didn’t know Constable McCrow or Constable Arnold and Mr Dare, we’ll continue to hear about their lives in many tributes. Our nation clearly has lost three wonderful Australians. Three people who embodied compassion, commitment... And courage during their lives and in their final moments. Certainly, those qualities are that which we will remember. And in which we will review. It’s those qualities which will continue to inspire confidence in us to confront evil wherever it lurks. Mr Speaker, I want to also acknowledge and pay tribute to Constable Randall Kirk and Constable Keely Brough. As the prime minister pointed out and others have said, their quick thinking and bravery has helped to save their own lives as well as others in calling for back-up. And we certainly wish Constable Kirk a speedy recovery from his wounds. Mr Speaker, at the National Police Memorial here in Canberra, there is a walkway, and engraved into that walkway are the words of loved ones, fellow officers and community members, in memory of those they have lost. There are these tributes – “She had special quality ... and community spirit.” And another: “That man was a godsend to the area. It needed someone just like you.” And whilst those words speak ... to specific individuals, of course, they also capture the ethos of Australia’s law enforcement community. Updated at 2.22am GMT 1.53am GMT Peter Dutton also then spoke. He made many pauses as he worked to get through his statement without being overwhelmed with emotion. I join with the prime minister in his fine words and acknowledge in the gallery today representing the police family, acting commissioner Ian McCartney, acting deputy commissioner Lisa Gale and acting assistant commissioner Steven Dometo. In the aftermath of a tragedy, we reflect on what we’ve lost and what we’ve learned. Constable Rachel McCrow was sworn in as a police officer last year. Her friends said she was a selfless-natured person, a genuine carer for others. She was a person who always went above and beyond and took pride in her job. Constable Matthew Arnold ... was a triplet. His former principal said that he was a talented athlete and that he will be remembered as a man of service and integrity and compassion. Alan Dare was due to celebrate his 26th wedding anniversary on Wednesday. A resident of Tara described him as a kind man who looked after disadvantaged teenagers. Constable McCrow, Constable Arnold and Mr Dare meant so much to so many. Updated at 2.23am GMT 1.51am GMT Anthony Albanese finished his speech with: It is true that every police officer knows the risks that they face in their line of duty. They are all too aware of the dangers. And yet they do their job each and every day, regardless. They do it for us, for our communities, for our nation. That is courage. It is public service at the highest level. And today, and every day, we pay tribute to each and every one of the police officers who serve us and protect us. Last night, the attorney general and I went to the police memorial here in Canberra at that overshadows the lake to lie a wreath with, as well, the acting commissioner of the Australian federal police, Ian McCartney, who is here with us today. And I welcome you, sir, and I thank you and all of your fellow officers for their service. I also acknowledge today in the gallery, joining us, acting deputy commissioner Lisa Gale and the acting assistant commissioner Steven Dometo. Mr Speaker, we grieve for Alan Dare. And we grieve for Matthew Arnold and Rachel McCrow, who have paid a price that no one who puts on the uniform should ever have to pay. We can never count the true cost. We can never repay the full debt. All we can offer is the humble thanks of a grateful nation and the heartfelt condolences of the Australian people. With honour they served. May they rest in peace. Updated at 2.05am GMT 1.50am GMT Anthony Albanese: Part of the responsibility that all of us have is not just a solemn duty of remembering and honouring those who were killed. It is examining what drove their killers and finding a way to draw that poison out of their nation. Our nation mourns with all those who loved Matthew Arnold, Rachel McCrow and Alan Dare. We know that for their families, this Christmas, there will be a place not taken. An empty space of grief and loss that the years will never be able to fill. To those families, we say again, today, Australia mourns with you. And we mourn also with the bigger community and the larger family to which all police officers past and present belong – including, I want to note, the leader of the opposition, who served as a Queensland police officer. Because we under stand that every death in the line of duty strikes in the heart of all those who serve, and casts a shadow over all of those who wait for their loved ones to come home from work. Updated at 2.25am GMT 1.49am GMT Anthony Albanese: It is a miracle that Keely survived. Tragically, Alan Dare did not. A neighbour, who came to the property’s front gate, driven by that great Australian instinct to help, an innocent Australian who paid for his kindness and concern with his life. Police officers in regional Australia are servants of the community and they’re part of its fabric. I’ve been speaking with the mayor, Paul McVeigh, and also, I had discussions with the local MP, the Leader of The Nationals, David Littleproud, about the nature of their communities. Over 200 Tara residents gathered at their police station to observe a minute’s silence for Matthew and Rachel. The Queensland Police Union chief executive Ian Leavers said: “In Chinchilla, they’ve run out of flowers. They had such a close-knit and caring communities and the loss of these lives has fallen hard on a great many people.” The community are gathering. Community tomorrow night will hold events in both Tara and Chinchilla. I’m advised by the Mayor that they are taking measures such as the local car wash is donating every dollar that goes through there to the families. The community are donating everything from sausages and other food and beverages so that they can gather together to mourn together. Locals have been saddened by these deaths and shocked by such a senseless atrocity. An act of violence and bloodshed so sudden, so cruel, so alien to the community and country that they know, and so far beyond rational comprehension. Updated at 1.56am GMT 1.48am GMT Anthony Albanese: Monday December 12 should have been an ordinary summer’s day on the Western Downs. A day of warmth under that big blue sky. A day of peace. Instead, that quiet was shattered by the gunfire of an atrocity. A vicious and deadly atrocity that has stolen lives, broken hearts and shocked our nation. On Monday afternoon, four Queensland police officers from the Tara Police Station all still just in their 20s, young people serving their community, a rich and full life ahead of them, were sent out on what was supposed to be a routine check. Just an ordinary part of the job that they were so proud to do. But the property they were visiting was no normal home or farm. It was, unbeknown to them, a fortress and an armoury. As the Queensland Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll, has said, they did not stand a chance. Constables Matthew Arnold and Rachel McCrow were murdered. Constable Randall Kirk was shot and wounded, and Constable Keely Brough assumed that she, too, would die. Either shot by her pursuers, or burned alive when they set the grass that she was sheltering in on fire to try to drive her out. Constable Brough grabbed her phone to seek assistance for her colleagues. And then, she texted her loved ones, what she imagined would be her final goodbyes. Even then, surrounded by danger and death, her first thought was for her fellow officers. Updated at 1.56am GMT 1.37am GMT ACT records country's lowest unemployment rate Among the states and territories, the ACT can claim bragging rights as the jurisdiction with the lowest unemployment rate. Last month it sank to 2.9% in trend terms from 3.1% in October, the ABS said. (Seasonally adjusted it was down to 2.5%.) Most states held their own in trend terms, with NSW the lowest among the big states, remaining at a jobless rate of 3.2%, while Victoria’s edged higher to 0.1 percentage points higher to 3.6%. The total numbers in work continued to swell last month, hitting 13.77m, seasonally adjusted – another record. While it’s remarkable how conditions have return to pre-pandemic trends, it’s also a reminder that as the population keeps growing it’s not uncommon for new highs to be scaled. Australia's workforce keep nudging new highs, regaining the trajectory it had before the pandemic disruptions. (Source: ABS.) pic.twitter.com/cHBlBLUbX2 — @phannam@mastodon.green (@p_hannam) December 15, 2022 If you tally unemployment and underemployment, both are now about two-thirds what there were in March 2020 before the pandemic really got going. Still, we can’t really say we’re in post-pandemic times (ask China). Covid case numbers aren’t falling (all those Christmas do’s where you have to yell into each other’s ears to be heard over the din don’t help). According to the ABS, those working fewer hours rose because of illness rose by 50,000 to 520,000. That’s about a third higher than would be typical for this time of year. Treasurer Jim Chalmers, meanwhile, welcomed the latest jobs figures, but added his usual qualifiers with an eye to less happy times ahead. We know Australia won’t be immune to the volatile global economic environment driving higher global inflation and slowing growth. International developments and cost of living pressures will inevitably have an impact on our economy and labour market. And, of course, “we’re only just starting to see the beginnings of wages growth”. Updated at 1.57am GMT 1.34am GMT Birmingham sends climate message to Coalition Simon Birmingham has acknowledged in Palau today that the Coalition had been too slow to adopt more ambitious climate policy. It is still couched in a defence of the former government and the familiar language about meeting and beating targets, but you will see he has a clear message to his Coalition colleagues back home. A quick reminder that earlier this year, the Coalition voted against the Albanese government’s bill to enshrine the new 43% 2030 target and net zero by 2050 pledge in law. The former Morrison government also resisted domestic and international calls to lift its 2030 target beyond the 26% to 28%, after the Nationals signalled they would veto such a move. When asked today to reflect on the Coalition’s climate policy over the years and how that affected Australia’s relationship with the region, Birmingham said: We’ve taken important steps over the years. We have obviously most recently taken the steps towards making a firm commitment, as was taken to Glasgow, for net zero by 2050. In terms of the targets that had been set for 2030, we put Australia on track not just to meet those targets, but to exceed those targets, as indeed Australia had met and exceeded its Kyoto 1 and Kyoto 2 commitment period targets as well.* Frankly, when you’re clearly on track to exceed targets, it makes sense to raise and to elevate those targets. And that probably should have occurred at an earlier stage. What’s clear to me from the few days that I’ve had from engagement with Pacific leaders like President Whipps is that it is critical for us to listen carefully and attentively to our Pacific partners and not just to listen, but to ensure that we act in concert with them. We do so in ways where we also show the maturity of explaining the challenges that Australia has. The change that is underway in Australia. We’ve seen record levels of investment in renewable energy in Australia, yet at times the domestic element of political debate - that hasn’t enabled us to convey that message as clearly as would have been ideal for all of our relations. And so ensuring that we have the types of dialogue that we’ve had through these last few days is important. And when it comes to domestic politics, ensuring that the voices that we hear from the Pacific are heard, and that we say the same things at home as we say here is equally critical in that regard. And that means, as I say, explaining the difficulties and the challenges when here, but also taking the difficult decisions when at home ... When you lose elections, it’s important to listen, to understand the reasons why you lost. And, so of course, that’s about listening to the Australian electorate but as shadow foreign minister it’s also about listening to all of our partners who we value in the region and globally to understand how we can most effectively shape policy to work with them as even deeper, stronger partners in the future. Simon Birmingham: raising emissions targets ‘probably should have occurred at an earlier stage’. Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP Earlier this week, Guardian Australia published an interview with Birmingham in which he conceded that the Coalition must listen “carefully to Pacific island nations” as part of what needs to be a “rock solid” bipartisan commitment to climate funding for the region. * Australia’s first Kyoto target allowed an 8% increase in emissions between 1990 and 2010. The Howard government also negotiated what became known as “the Australia clause” to allow the factoring in of emissions from land clearing. As analysts have explained, the base year for the first target had a very high level of land clearing, which made the target easier to meet. Updated at 1.54am GMT 1.33am GMT Mark Dreyfus and David Littleproud are also giving speeches. Littleproud is not just the leader of the Nationals here – he is also the local member for where it happened. I will bring you more of the speeches very soon. 1.22am GMT Dutton vows to ‘confront evil wherever it lurks’ in condolence motion Peter Dutton is now reading his speech. He is obviously very emotional and is having to stop frequently in order to get through his words. Our nation clearly has lost three wonderful Australians. Three people who embodied compassion, commitment and courage during their lives and in their final moments. Simply those qualities that we will remember in which we will reveal, those qualities which will continue to inspire confidence in us to confront evil wherever it lurks. Updated at 1.30am GMT 1.20am GMT PM offers ‘thanks of a grateful nation’ in tribute to Queensland shooting victims There is absolute silence in the house for this condolence motion. We will bring you some of Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton, a former Queensland police officer, very soon. Albanese has finished his speech with: We grieve for Alan Dare, and we grieve for Matthew Arnold and Rachel McCrow, who have paid a price that no one who puts on the uniform should ever have to pay. We can never count the true cost. We can never repay the full debt. All we can offer as a humble thanks of a grateful nation, and the heartfelt condolences of the Australian people with honour they served. May they rest in peace. Updated at 1.31am GMT 1.11am GMT The house is now turning to a condolence motion for the three people, including two police officers, killed on Monday in Queensland. There is a very big speaking list for this. Given the house’s condensed hours, not everyone will get a chance, so the debate will be suspended and picked up again when parliament resumes in February. 1.09am GMT The bill is being read a third time and there is applause in the chamber from Labor and the Greens. Off to the Senate it goes. Updated at 1.12am GMT 1.06am GMT The house is dividing on the legislation. We will have the final vote for you very soon (and then once passed, the house it will be off to the Senate). Updated at 1.17am GMT 1.03am GMT Perrottet won’t rule out small nuclear reactors The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has refused to rule out small modular nuclear reactors after the treasurer, Matt Kean, earlier today said they were “exciting”. Asked about the comments made by his deputy later in the day, Perrottet said: When it comes to technology, well, I’m agnostic. What we’re focused on is making sure we have downward pressure on prices in the short term and energy security in the long term. I’m not ruling anything in or out. He agreed that energy was exciting and that new technologies should be embraced. When it comes to energy security, you can’t rule anything out, you’ve got to be open-minded right across the board. We’re not close-minded to any forms of energy generation, we’re completely open-minded. It’s about making sure we have energy security in the long term and put downward pressure on prices in the short term. Earlier in the day, Kean told 2GB the state would be “open to looking at options like nuclear if they were commercially available”. Updated at 1.07am GMT 1.02am GMT For those following along, Ted O’Brien had some questions about the legislation for Jim Chalmers – what specifically in the legislation excluded Western Australia etc – but it does not seem that Chalmers answered them. 1.01am GMT Simon Birmingham concedes Australia should have strengthened its 2030 emissions target earlier The opposition’s Senate leader, Simon Birmingham, has conceded during a visit to the Pacific that Australia should have strengthened its 2030 emissions reduction target sooner than it did. He also says the Coalition needs to learn the lessons of its election loss, and that would involve listening not just to the Australian electorate but also valued Pacific partners. We’ll bring you the full quotes shortly 1.00am GMT While we wait for this to play out, here is another question: Why don’t we ever read anything about the Federation Chamber? It’s a good question and the answer is – we don’t usually have time. Because it is the spill over chamber, for ongoing, without interfering with the house business, we usually focus on what is happening in the house – as that is where the main action is. We do try and go back and read the federation chamber debates, and there are often some very good contributions from members – and usually more thoughtful ones, as there is not the same pressure as the house – but in terms of the daily focus, it remains in the house. 12.56am GMT Back in the chamber and Ted O’Brien has moved on to questions for Jim Chalmers. There is still a bit to go here. 12.54am GMT Wong says Australia’s push to co-host a UN climate conference in partnership with the Pacific would provide an opportunity for the voices of the Pacific to be heard more loudly: Our motivation for hosting this is because we want to keep the world on track to stay below 1.5 and to make sure that the Paris and Glasgow commitments are met - that is out motivation ... We accept we have to do more and I’ve been honest about that. The opposition’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Simon Birmingham, who is also part of the bipartisan trip, says: The delegation that we bring of government and opposition from Australia is one of standing together ... in support of the friendship and the partnership we have with Pacific island nations. 12.54am GMT Climate transformation ‘a big job for us’, Wong tells Pacific The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, says Australia is undergoing a “necessary” and “overdue” transformation of its emissions-intensive economy. Speaking in Palau, Wong pays tribute to the president of Palau, Surangel Whipps, for his leadership. She says: When I was climate minister one of the things which struck me and was which moved me was the authenticity and power of the voice of the Pacific, for the reasons that you outlined, President: you are living it. At the time and for, unfortunately, the subsequent decade, my country was involved in a domestic political debate about climate along political partisan lines. And what struck me about visiting Palau and Vanuatu and Solomon Islands and Tuvalu was that this was not a political issue for the people of the Pacific. It was an existential issue and it is an existential issue - it is about culture, land and sea, [it is] the number 1 security issue for the Pacific. Wong says to Whipps: Your contribution to the conference of the parties [Cop] where you talked about [how] it’s like bombing us - it’s a profoundly important thing to say to the countries of the world. Wong adds that the Labor government was elected “with a greater ambition on climate” but she also acknowledges it is “a big job for us”. She says Australia has had an emissions-intensive economy, with the majority of power from coal. She says Australia’s 2030 target is a 43% cut in emissions, but embedded within that is to move from majority coal to renewable energy comprising in excess of 80% by 2030. Wong asks for the Pacific’s understanding that “we’re pushing the rudder” and it will “take a while for the boat to turn”. Updated at 12.56am GMT 12.53am GMT Woman, 74, dies after being hit by bus in Sydney Moving away from politics for just a moment to update you on something the Guardian news blog posted yesterday. NSW police have confirmed a 74-year-old woman died after she was hit by a bus in Sydney’s CBD yesterday afternoon. From the NSW police media release: NSW Ambulance paramedics treated the 74-year-old woman at the scene. She was taken to St Vincent’s Hospital but died later that evening. Officers from Sydney City Police Area Command established a crime scene that was examined by specialist officers from the Crash Investigation Unit. The male bus driver – also 74-years-old – was taken to Sydney Hospital for mandatory testing. He was later taken to Day Street Police Station and charged with dangerous driving occasioning death-drive manner dangerous, negligent driving (occasioning death) and not give way to pedestrian (right turn). The Dulwich Hill man has been granted condition bail to appear at Downing Centre Local Court on Wednesday 11 January 2023. His driver’s licence has been suspended. Updated at 12.56am GMT 12.51am GMT Seasonally adjusted jobs participation rate up to 66.8% The November labour market numbers are mostly on the upside. The jobless rate stayed put at 3.4% even as the economy added 64,000 jobs (more than half of them fulltime) because more people were looking for work, the ABS said. Indeed, the seasonally adjusted participation rate crept up to 66.8%, a record level. (Had it stayed at the devilish forecast rate of 66.6%, the overall jobless rate would probably have dropped to a fresh half-century low of 3.3%.) Monthly hours worked sank to 1.9bn to be one down arrow. “The participation rate increased by 0.2 percentage points to 66.8% November, returning to the record high we saw in June 2022,” Bjorn Jarvis, head of labour statistics at the ABS, said. “It was 1.0 percentage point higher than before the pandemic.” That recovery in those looking for work in Australia, post pandemic, is in contrast to the US, for example. A lot more people haven’t returned to the labour market, which partly explains that country’s much faster wage growth. Women’s participation rate is also back to matching its historical high of June at 62.4%. For men, it was 71.3%. “The record high participation rate continues to show that it is a tight labour market, especially when coupled with very low unemployment,” Jarvis said. Updated at 12.56am GMT 12.50am GMT Jim Chalmers sums up government’s position on energy bill before vote Jim Chalmers is now summing up the government’s position on the energy bill, ahead of the vote and is using the opportunity to accuse the opposition of “selling out” Australians by not supporting the legislation. The Coalition is very agitated over this and there is a lot of yelling across the chamber. The Coalition wanted the bill split so that the rebates would be seperate to the market intervention (which the Coalition claims will impact Australia’s gas and coal industries). There is absolutely no reason to split the bill though – the government has the support it needs in the Senate without the opposition. There also seems to have been some short memories in the LNP given that, for a good while there, the Coalition was threatening its own market intervention through its “big stick” legislation. That didn’t end up happening, and a voluntary code of conduct was put in place –but given where prices are, and are heading, the government is now moving to make the code mandatory. Updated at 12.54am GMT 12.45am GMT As we come to the end of the energy bill debate, we are getting some questions through about what some of it will mean. Did you have any more detail about that this “electrification package” that has been negotiated for next year? Not as yet. We know that a package is being worked up for the budget which aims to help low- and middle-income households move from gas appliances to electric ones. Whether or not that is in the form of direct cash rebates (doubtful) or directly on products (gas hot water/stoves – more likely) is yet to be confirmed, as it is still being worked up. Victoria is moving in this direction as a state and it was something that the government was already working on when the Greens added it as part of their negotiations. The tricky part is going to be what happens when some people (renters etc) are left with gas appliances, given that when more people leave the gas grid, the more expensive gas will be. But all those details are still being worked out. Updated at 12.52am GMT 12.40am GMT Meanwhile, we are almost there in the chamber. Energy bill about to pass the House of Representatives #auspol — Katharine Murphy (@murpharoo) December 15, 2022 Updated at 12.45am GMT 12.37am GMT Palau president stresses importance of climate action to Pacific The president of Palau, Surangel Whipps, has told Penny Wong and Simon Birmingham that he was “extremely honoured to welcome your delegation to Palau”. He says cooperation with Australia in the maritime sector – including protecting Palau’s exclusive economic zone – was a “symbol of Pacific cooperation and protecting the role of law, freedom democracy and the values that we share”. Whipps stresses the importance of climate action to the Pacific: When it comes to climate change I said to [the] Cop 26 [climate summit], you might as well bomb us because it’s constant, whether it’s typhoons, drought, the heat and sea level rise. Your coming helps you understand the challenges we face … This visit signifies the importance of the relationship and bringing that relationship to a higher level. Whipps also mentions renewable energy projects: One thing that Palau has learned not only is it important for reducing our carbon but also important to build resilience against the challenges of conflict which have raised the cost of fuel and really are holding us hostage to fossil fuels. Whipps also thanks Australia for “leading the way in saying let’s bring Cop to the Pacific” (Australia wants to host a climate summit in 2026 in partnership with the Pacific). He thanks Australia for raising its 2030 target to 43%, “which is important for keeping the world temperature below 1.5 which is so important for Pacific islands that are going under”. He also mentions flights between Brisbane and Palau are due to begin in February: Please fill up that plane – come and visit. Updated at 12.45am GMT 12.35am GMT Unemployment rate steady at 3.4% for November The unemployment rate is out: Australia’s unemployment rate in November was 3.4%, the ABS has just announced. It was 3.4% in October and economists had predicted a similar result for last month. Updated at 12.39am GMT 12.34am GMT Penny Wong visits Palau for second time The president of Palau, Surangel Whipps Jr, is speaking at an event in Koror with Penny Wong. Daniel Hurst will have more for you very soon on Wong’s second visit to Palau (the first was as a bipartisan group with then foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop) This visit is also bipartisan – Simon Birmingham is also there. Whipps dropped a little tidbit about Birmingham’s experience, while talking of his excitement of direct flights from Brisbane to Palau now being available: We have a beautiful ocean, a warm ocean because Senator Birmingham was able to swim this morning, and our jellyfish are harmless. I went to the Great Barrier Reef and was told to pull on these suits otherwise you will die. I want to welcome all the divers and snorkellers, come and see our culture and see what is unique about Palau. I begrudge no one time in the ocean. It is good for the soul. In fact, auspol would probably be a much more chill experience if the parliament had been placed at Jervis Bay. Updated at 12.41am GMT 12.23am GMT Given it is the last (lol – famous last words) politics blog for the year, we thought it time to do another ask us anything. Not in podcast form this time, but in the blog. So let us know – what burning questions do you have about politics? Or the team, if that’s where your mind goes? Send them through to me at amy.remeikis@theguardian.com and I will get through as many as I can 12.21am GMT Greens to explain their position on energy bill The Greens are holding a press conference at 12.15 to discuss where and why they landed where they did on the energy bill (in support, as long as no extra funds go to fossil fuel companies and support for the electrification package in next May’s budget). Updated at 12.26am GMT 12.02am GMT Albanese says opposition will be ‘held to account’ on energy bill Anthony Albanese had some things to say on the energy bill in the house: Apparently, those opposite want us to have acted quicker, but also want us to be slower at the same time. Having had 22 policies in government, but not landing one of them, they now want us to have no policy also. They were addicted to power – but hopeless on energy. They rushed around passing legislation about strawberries – laws that have never been used – but did nothing to help people with their power bills. The only time they acted with urgency was to cover-up the 20% increase in power prices and to keep it a secret until after the election. And now they are seeking to stand in the way of this urgent action because they imagine that somehow it serves their political agenda. Well, the choice for this parliament today is very clear. Vote for this plan – and vote for lower prices. Or vote against it – and vote for higher prices. Vote for this plan – and stand up for jobs, industry and households. Or vote against it – and stand with them, with companies banking record profits and sending them offshore. That is the choice. Vote for this plan – and be part of the solution. Or vote against it – and be part of the problem. The opposition will be held to account for their decision. Updated at 12.14am GMT 12.01am GMT PBO wants feedback on ‘build your own budget’ tool The Parliamentary Budget Office wants some feedback on its plan to release a “build your own budget” tool. You can find the consultation paper here. The PBO wants more people to understand how the budget works as part of its education role. But in the meantime, you can build your own budget with us here, and work out what you could spend the stage-three tax cuts on yourself (and don’t expect that issue to go away anytime soon – it will be one of the main issues of the first half of next year). Related: You be the treasurer: scrap the stage-three tax cuts, spend money, or pay down the federal budget deficit Updated at 12.09am GMT 11.50pm GMT Labour market figures to round out ABS’s year of living statistically We’ll get the November jobless figures from the ABS at 11.30am (AEDT), which will likely be the last headline stats for 2022 unless you’re hankering for the annual reweighting of the cost of living and CPI baskets, and the odd number on mortality (both out next week). October’s unemployment rate came in at 3.4%, matching the figure for July. Both of which are at about 50-year lows, and so even a modest bump up for last month probably won’t change the narrative about the labour market remaining very tight. (In the September quarter, about 1:30 jobs were vacant, or double the pre-pandemic ratio, the ABS told us yesterday.) The flip side would be a drop in the rate to 3.3% or lower, which would set off fresh alarms about the Reserve Bank needing to ditch the notion of pausing in its interest rate climb, and hike again when it returns from its summer repose in February. Banks such ANZ and CBA are expecting the rate in November to hold at 3.4%, with job additions in the 15-20,000 range. A shift in the participation rate up or down often determines which way the jobless rate arrow points. Since it’s the unexpected last day (probably) for federal parliament as MPs return to vote on the government’s energy bill, it’s not a bad time to reflect a little on labour stats. At the end of 2021, the unemployment rate was at 4.2% and by April it was down to 3.9% according to ABS data released just three days before the federal election in May. Of the three big economic events during the election campaign, the jobs figures were arguably the Morrison government’s trump card in terms of economic management. (They might also claim the improving budget deficit but that was still a big red number, and so not really a number to trumpet.) The other two, though, had been the surprising CPI spike to 5.1% for the March quarter and the subsequent RBA interest rate rise days later. Those two events set a tone that made it even harder for the government to win over swinging voters, many of whom would have voted by the time the more upbeat jobs numbers landed. Since the election, the numbers have generally got better and better – with the exception that wages are not yet rising in line with the ongoing scramble to keep or attract new staff. Updated at 12.03am GMT 11.43pm GMT Suicide Prevention Australia urges PM to reverse cuts to subsidised mental health appointments Suicide Prevention Australia has asked the prime minister to step in and reverse the decision to cut the number of subsidised mental health appointments under the Better Access program from 20 to 10. The government says it is returning the program to the original 10 subsidised sessions to help more people access mental health support, with long waiting lists for people to access even one session. But the peak body, Suicide Prevention Australia, says it is the wrong move until reforms are delivered which would address the issues the government says it is attempting to address. The Suicide Prevention Australia chief executive, Nieves Murray, said the second part of the Suicide Prevention Australia’s Community Tracker for the December Quarter (2022), released today, found one-in-five Australian adults (22%) reported being formally diagnosed with a mental illness in the past 12 months. A further 19% revealed they had been diagnosed with a mental illness at some point prior to the past 12 months, bringing the overall number of Australians diagnosed with mental illness in their lives to 42%. Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data shows over 60% of people who die by suicide have a mental illness or behavioural disorder. Access to timely, effective and affordable mental health treatment is critically important to suicide prevention. Murray: We know people need help and are willing to get it. It’s the worst possible time to reduce support. We need a stronger safety net for those at-risk of missing out on critical support as a result of these changes.

O’Brien is also very angry about the market intervention and the government telling businesses what to do. There is a lot of pointing across the despatch box. A lot. That pointing finger got a work out. Updated at 11.28pm GMT 11.12pm GMT Treasurer says gas price cap still high by historical standards with 96% of offers below cap And on the gas price caps, Jim Chalmers said this during his speech: The legislation contains a sunset clause so that the power to make these orders ends 12 months after the commencement of any order made – or if no order is made, 12 months after the commencement of the Bill. Through this instrument, the government intends to implement a temporary price cap of $12 per gigajoule. The ACCC has identified this price based on the costs of production and a reasonable return on capital. And it is still a high domestic price by historical standards. In 2021, the ACCC found that there were 289 domestic offers made by producers and retailers, with 96% of offers below $12 per gigajoule, and the average price $9.20 per gigajoule. The bill also includes measures to detect, deter and address any non-compliance with the price cap. For transactions that fall under the scope of the emergency price order, prices above the cap will be subject to enforcement action. The price cap will be reviewed in mid-2023, to ensure it is having the intended effect, and to consider whether adjustments are needed. Updated at 11.20pm GMT 11.09pm GMT Treasurer Jim Chalmers introduced the bill to the house about 20 minutes ago. He said in his speech: This is a plan agreed by National Cabinet – endorsed by every Premier and Chief Minister, from both sides of politics, and we thank them for their cooperation. They, like us, know that action is needed now. Our collective measures to address gas and coal prices are estimated to reduce the impact of forecast electricity prices next financial year by 13 percentage points – And reduce expected inflation in 2023-24 by around an estimated half a percentage point. And our direct assistance will provide hundreds of dollars of energy bill relief in addition to these measures. And that’s what this choice – this coming vote – really comes down to. Higher power prices or lower power prices? Relief on energy bills, or no relief? Protecting Australian industry and jobs, or abandoning them? 10.57pm GMT Treasurer accuses opposition of ‘hiding behind process point’ of when they received draft legislation On Peter Dutton’s contention the Coalition only received the legislation at 8.45pm last night, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, told ABC radio RN “they received draft legislation last week” and accused the opposition of “hiding behind this process point”. … They have spent weeks giving the metaphorical middle finger to manufacturers, and families and small businesses doing it tough under high energy prices, they have been playing politics all along and that is what they are doing with this process now. They got a draft of this legislation last week, we said we would take into consideration the consultation on this draft, we did that yesterday and when it was ready after that consultation, we provided it to the opposition in the usual way. Updated at 11.09pm GMT 10.44pm GMT The house sitting has begun so we are under way. Let the energy legislation begin. Updated at 11.02pm GMT 10.44pm GMT Unlikely any Liberal MPs will cross the floor on energy bill Good morning all from the House of Representatives chamber in Canberra. Now that Peter Dutton has confirmed the Coalition will vote against the government’s energy price relief package, I thought it prudent to check in with a couple of Liberals to see if there will be any floor crossing this morning. I hear the Victorian Liberal Russell Broadbent used the opportunity of the Coalition party room meeting at 8.15am to counsel his colleagues that it isn’t a good idea to try and govern from opposition. What he means by that is the Coalition can take a per se or principled position that it is bad for governments to be in the business of controlling gas prices, but it’s hard to explain to people that per se or principled position means you are voting against lower energy bills. But my intel suggests Broadbent won’t cross the floor this morning. Liberal Bridget Archer says she would rather the bill be split so she could support supplying price relief, but she won’t cross the floor because she’s concerned about a lack of information about the implications of the intervention. After procedural argy bargy, the House is now on to the substantive business of considering the legislation. Updated at 11.02pm GMT 10.43pm GMT Dutton calls for crackdown on encrypted messaging On the issue of the Queensland shooting and the role of internet companies, Peter Dutton said: We invested a record amount into Asio and the federal police and the Australian Crime Commission, other agencies and they worked hand-in-glove with their state authorities. Like we’ve seen in recent years, the spread of disinformation on the internet and the way in which that infects people’s minds and changes their whole persona, their whole perspective, and causes them to commit or contributes, at least, to them committing extreme acts, should be of concern to any right thinking Australian. So, this is why we’ve had a debate in recent years about encryption, where there are messages and encrypted messaging apps, and an exchange of information, of disinformation, between these groups. I mean, we only know what we’ve seen publicly in relation to the incident in Queensland. So, no doubt, all of that investigation is still under way. But it should be a real concern. So, when we’ve spoken for many years about the concern that police agencies and intelligence agencies had where they just can’t get access, as they normally would, with an exchange years ago of a telephone call or a handwritten letter or messages which could be discovered with a warrant. Now, the police can’t discover that information. So, when you’ve got that environment where there can be no transparency and there can be no discovery, then you will have these groups manifesting their lunacy and reinforcing each other’s ideas and prejudices and it manifests in tragic ways. So, we should be very realistic about the benefit of the internet in many ways in our lives, but also the downside that really causes me great concern not just as a leader in our country, but as a parent, as well, because you worry about the information that your children are accessing online. Impressionable young minds – as we’ve seen in recent years – can be encouraged to go off to conflict. They can be encouraged to spread all sorts of conspiracy theories and subscribe to those and spread that hatred and we should be very concerned about that. We would support the government in any measures they had to hold some of these companies and these platforms to account, because if a court issues a warrant, that information should be discoverable by police. Like the knocking on a door and not giving them access to a safe because, even if they had a warrant, are you saying that they can’t get into the safe? It just doesn’t make any sense. It’s just a technology issue and we’re allowing these people to manifest their crazy ideas online. Updated at 11.16pm GMT 10.39pm GMT Dutton ‘honestly believes’ energy price caps will be ‘catastrophic for economic policy in this country’ Peter Dutton continued: I honestly believe that this is catastrophic for economic policy in this country, and as we know, these sorts of market interventions don’t just restrict themselves in terms of the impact to the energy sector, there will be other companies in other sectors who are looking to invest here at the moment, who will be looking at the sovereign risk that’s created out of this and questioning whether they will invest in agriculture or whether they’ll invest in the manufacturing, advanced manufacturing, into the healthcare sector. They will look at this government’s stance and they will see with one commodity where you’ve got a high-inflationary environment, the government is willing to intervene – why wouldn’t they do it elsewhere? It’s a reasonable question for investors to ask, and so there is a very significant economic policy here that’s in question and the Coalition is not going to stand for it. If the government wants to play political stunts and tricks, let them do that. We made it clear that we would provide support for a bill which includes relief to people who have seen their power prices go up under this government but if the government blends it in with the price mechanism, we’re not going to support that bill. The chair of the Australian Energy Regulator, Clare Savage, said this morning on RN the regulator was already seeing energy prices come down, about 40-50% in Queensland and New South Wales, just from when the government spoke about intervention after it handed down its budget in October (this is also rolled into that) so there is some impact. Updated at 10.52pm GMT 10.35pm GMT Dutton says Albanese and Labor ‘have no plan’ to bring energy prices down as parliament set to pass bill We brought you some of Peter Dutton’s comments a little earlier – here was his opening remarks to his press conference: We received the legislation at 8.45pm last night, so we’ll have a party room later this morning, but my recommendation to our party room will be that we support the payment, the support to families who are really doing it tough under this government at the moment. These are families that have heard the prime minister say on 97 occasions that he would reduce their power bills by $275 and then deliver a budget which had no plan whatsoever. This has been a cruel hoax and a con job by the prime minister. If people think their power bills are going down under this prime minister, just look at his budget document. It says that power prices will go up by 56%, that gas will go up by 44%, and Chris Bowen – who I’ll come back to in a second – Chris Bowen declares that he and the prime minister can’t be held to account because there’s no silver bullet and no guarantee that power prices will go down. You know, well, ‘no shock, Sherlock*’. I mean, the fact is that power prices will continue to go up and up and up under this Labor government because they have no idea what they’re doing. *That is not what people say, but I suppose it is still family friendly hours. Dutton continued: I lived through the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years and this has all of the mayhem and chaotic nonsense that we saw during that period. The prime minister had a shambolic press conference last Friday. He promised that there would be* legislation and a plan, but it’s clear that they’re still drafting this thing as we speak. So, I think there’ll be a number of amendments, even to the original draft, and it’s clear that the government has made this up on the run, and Australians should take no assurance, no comfort, from the words of the prime minister at the moment because he has no plan. He can’t explain to you how power prices will come down. In the budget, of course, they funded activists to try and stop gas coming into the system**. If you’ve got increased demand for gas in the system, how can you reduce supply? Because you’ll drive up prices. So, on the one hand, the government’s offering support, on the other they are driving prices up. **The tense of this is interesting, given that there is legislation. *Are the activists with us in the room right now? Updated at 10.47pm GMT 10.16pm GMT NSW treasurer Matt Kean says state is open to option of small modular nuclear reactors in future The New South Wales treasurer, Matt Kean, said the state government was open to looking at small modular nuclear reactors as part of the state’s energy mix into the future, calling them “exciting technology”. Speaking to 2GB on Thursday morning, he said: Of course we’d be open to looking at options like nuclear if they were commercially available. Small modular nuclear reactors are exciting technology, which may come available in the future. Right now the small modular nuclear reactor prototypes are not going to be ready until the mid-2030s and that may be something we should look at, but right now we’ve got a problem and we need to deal with it with the technologies we have available. A fortnight ago, Kean labeled an idea floated by former staffer and Liberal candidate at the upcoming state election, Matt Cross, of small-scale nuclear reactors in every community as a fantasy. He said: There’s not a single micro nuclear reactor that’s commercially available anywhere in the world. People can chase all kinds of fantasies. Updated at 10.24pm GMT 10.00pm GMT Over on the ABC, Bowen was also asked about the electrification package and said much the same thing. He was then asked if the Greens had actually secured it, given he says that Labor was working on it anyway and answered: Look, I’m not interested in apportioning credit, we’re getting things done and we’re working across the Parliament, with the Greens, with the crossbench, with people of good faith who want to work with us. The Opposition’s made themselves irrelevant but just opposing everything; that’s a matter for them, but where the Parliament works best is where parties ‑ we’ve had plenty of disagreements with the Greens, but we also have areas of agreement where we can come together and work on things together, the Parliament and the country are better off, that’s the case across the board with people of good faith and goodwill working together in the national interest; that’s what’s occurred here. 9.55pm GMT Electrification through Greens-backed package could make households ‘much, much more efficient’, Chris Bowen says Chris Bowen was also on the Seven network (honestly, the man was everywhere this morning) where he was asked about the electrification package the Greens said it secured in next year’s budget. The detail is still being worked out, but it is about getting households off of gas and on to electricity, where renewables on the grid should help bring down energy prices as time goes on. (The trick will be making sure financially vulnerable households aren’t left holding the can – the more households coming off of gas, the more expensive gas will be.) Bowen this morning told Seven viewers: Well, people obviously will always be able to make their own choices, but we’ve been working for a while on this thing called the National Energy Performance Strategy, and we had a good conversation with the Greens, and the Greens suggested that we deliver a package pre‑budget, in the lead‑up to the budget, which we’re more than happy to do as the first dividend of that strategy. Really, it’s about providing support for households and businesses to make the best energy choices for them, because electrification and energy efficiency can reduce your bills, can actually be a healthier result in your house and can be much, much more efficient, and so there’s a number of ways we can do it. We can provide low-interest loans through the CEFC, which we’re already doing for electric cars, for example; there’s lots of things we can do. It’s entirely in keeping with our agenda, and that’s what a good government does, works across the aisle with people of good faith to get things done where we can find agreement. That’s what a mature sensible grown‑up government does, and that’s exactly what we’ve done again. Updated at 10.12pm GMT 9.48pm GMT ‘Australians will pay the price’ for Labor energy bill, Angus Taylor says Angus Taylor held a doorstop (quick press conference) early this morning where he reiterated the Coalition’s opposition to the energy legislation. Well today’s vote on this bill is the end of a shambolic and disgraceful process after months of inaction, thought bubbles being dropped on an almost daily basis by government ministers. We’re being asked to vote today on a Bill that we hadn’t seen until late last night. It was still being baked yesterday afternoon and it’s come out completely undercooked. Now, we know that to get this through the parliament, Labor has done a sweetheart deal with the Greens. We don’t know how much they’ve given them. But we do know the Greens passed or approved this legislation, agreed to support this legislation completely sight unseen. This is like the buyer of a house coming in and buying the house without having even seen it. Without having seen it. This is what the Greens have done. Now the worst part of is, of course, is Australians will pay the price. Australians will pay the price for a disgraceful piece of legislation and a disgraceful process. Labor was elected in May. At least some of the energy price increase ahead was known by the Coalition before the election. But in politics, nothing matters except what matters in the moment. Updated at 10.01pm GMT 9.36pm GMT ‘Our job to intervene’ in industry in extraordinary circumstance: Chris Bowen The price caps are temporary (they are in place for a year). So what is to stop the government from doing it again? Chris Bowen told the ABC it’s a measure for the times. Well, this is an extraordinary circumstance. This is a war circumstance where 90% of the price rises around the world, we know from the International Energy Agency, have been caused by the impact of coal and gas of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. So this is pretty unusual. And we don’t think that it is appropriate, and I’ll be very frank and blunt about this. We don’t think that it is appropriate for some companies to make very big profits as a result of those war prices and war profits at the expense of Australian households and consumers. I know some people, particularly the companies involved, will disagree with that. News flash – gas companies like big [profits]. But it’s our job to intervene, carefully, methodically in the base interests of the Australian industry. Updated at 9.49pm GMT 9.32pm GMT Angus Taylor repeats gas industry arguments against price caps Here is a little more from that interview with Angus Taylor. He is asked why the government’s legislation won’t work and says: Well, because we will see supply shortages and the industry experts and participants are all saying this. Look, there’s years and years, decades and decades of experience with price caps around the world. It’s microeconomics 101. If you impose an aggressive price cap, you drive supply shortages. The ABC interviewer then points out that Taylor is making the gas industry’s case for it. Thomas Oriti: I mean, that’s … forgive me but that’s the argument of the gas industry. Supply being reduced if price caps are put in place. Some people listening might be asking the question, hang on, we’re paying more and more for power bills. Do you actually care about gas prices for households or are you lobbying for the gas industry? Taylor responds: We absolutely care about prices for households and I was minister when we saw the gas price being driven down from $20 to $5 and I wasn’t loved by the energy players, I can tell you that, Thomas … I always took a tough stand on them doing the right thing. But I’m not interested in policy that simply doesn’t work, that’s shambolic, that’s not understood by the government, that was still being baked late yesterday afternoon and has come out completely undercooked … The prices are completely unregulated in the markets that really matter. In Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane, the price can be whatever it can be. This is how bizarre this legislation is. So if there are shortages, there’ll be price gouging. … This legislation is badly thought through, it followed from months of thought bubbles from every senior member of the government who was in this area of policy and it’s come out completely undercooked. It won’t work. It will lead to supply shortages. You say that only the gas industry says price caps drives supply shortages. We saw this in the 70s. We saw it in the 80s. We saw it after the second world war. It’s in every microeconomics textbook right at the beginning. When you impose price caps, you see shortages and then there’s price gouging that follows from that … the real test here is will Australians’ bills be lower after this legislation goes through? The government has not been saying bills will go down – but that they won’t increase as much as they are slated to, because of the intervention. There is also the rebates, which are still to be worked out with the states, which will help eligible people. Updated at 9.46pm GMT 9.29pm GMT Angus Taylor criticises ‘months of inaction and delay’ over Labor energy bill Here is Angus Taylor on ABC News Radio explaining why the Coalition will not be supporting the energy bill today: Can I first say that the most important thing we want to see here is more affordable, reliable energy for all Australians; but we simply can’t support this bill in its current form. I should say I only received a copy of the bill late last night. It’s been an absolutely shambolic process. There’s been months of inaction and delay and to deliver to the parliament the bill that we’re supposed to vote on today, late last night is an absolute disgrace. We saw even just yesterday afternoon, the energy minister couldn’t explain what was in the bill. Now, what we need to see is more supply being pumped in and sold into the Australian domestic network. It’s worked for us in the past. We got the price of gas down from $20 a gigajoule down to closer to $5 a gigajoule and yet Labor instead is taking an approach which simply won’t work. Updated at 9.35pm GMT 9.27pm GMT Back to politics now, but hold your heads up high, Morocco fans. What a run. Updated at 9.31pm GMT 9.25pm GMT ‘Not just for Morocco, but for all Arabs, Africans and Muslims’: mixed emotions for Moroccan fans in Darling Harbour Both disappointment and elation hung over Tumbalong Park in Darling Harbour this morning, as France beat Morocco in the World Cup semi-final. A strong but divided crowd descended on to the live viewing sight, set up for Australia’s loss to Argentina in the round of 16, and maintained for the semi-finals. And when France scored their second goal to seal a tight and nervy win over the Moroccan underdogs, half the crowd exploded, flags and cheers filling the cold morning air. The goal only momentarily silenced the Moroccan fans, who returned to their drumming and cheering soon after, their disappointment becoming pride. A variety of flags dotted the crowd, in addition to the French and Moroccan flags, with Algerian and Palestinian fans present. Yacine Elakil said Morocco had the better chances and should have scored, but was proud of their efforts nonetheless. “We’re sad but we’re happy at the same time. We’re so proud of these players and what they’ve achieved, it’s been a great journey.” “This run to the semi-finals was not just for Morocco, but for all Arabs, Africans and Muslims. It’s for anyone who feels Moroccan, all are welcome.” But French fans left floating, many saying they were surprised at the French success in this World Cup, but we’re looking forward to a final showdown with Argentina. Loraine said she braved the cold this morning to witness what she said was a “legendary” moment. “Seeing Morocco and France in a semi-final has been special, it was worth it because we would be happy no matter the result. Obviously I supported France, but would’ve been happy if Morocco won.” “It’s so great to see this sense of community here today, and we’re looking forward to the final against Messi. We were champs four years ago, we can be champs again.” Updated at 9.31pm GMT 9.24pm GMT ‘We have followed them forever’: Morocco and France fans turn out in Darling Harbour for semi-final A rambunctious crowd descended on Tumbalong Park in Darling Harbour for Moroccco’s World Cup semi-final against France. An early goal for France dampened things only momentarily, with the local Moroccan diaspora out in full force, drumming and singing for their team. But it was not a completely partisan crowd; French flags and national team jerseys dotted the crowd, but are being drowned out by the jumping and singing Moroccan supporters. Supporters of both teams told me they were confident of the win, with the match seemingly still in the balance to both sides. Ahmed says he didn’t expect the Moroccan support to be so strong in Darling Harbour, but has welcomed it regardless. We are a small community here in Sydney, but you see we turn up for the team; we have followed them forever and will continue following them. As you can see by the drumming and dancing, we don’t need that many people anyways. Meanwhile Maxence Leroux recently migrated to Australia from France, and said while the Moroccan contingent were strong, there were many French supporters in the crowd, and in Sydney. The Moroccan players and supporters have made this a great match, it’s a great atmosphere here today. I didn’t expect France to go this far, but now that they’re here, I want them to win. Tumbalong Park absolutely jumping this morning for Morocco’s semifinal against France. Going behind clearly hasn’t dampened things. pic.twitter.com/VeQ8j1BdjE — Mostafa Rachwani (@Rachwani91) December 14, 2022 Updated at 9.56pm GMT 9.19pm GMT Industry minister Ed Husic says energy intervention is ‘doing what is right’ Ed Husic appeared on ABC News Breakfast a little earlier this morning where he was asked whether or not he expected the coal and gas industry to campaign against the government for its energy intervention. Husic, as the industry minister, has been critical of the gas industry in particular for its prices and what that is doing to the manufacturing sector: I come back to this point: We are doing what is right in the national economic interest. There is give and take to get the balance right and you have asked me before, some manufacturers will appreciate that the cap is in place and others will say it is too high. Gas producers will say this is all too low, our pricing is too low and this cap is setting the price too low and this isn’t right. We have got to be able to moderate expectations and do what is right, come together as a country to do what is right for the nation’s economic interest. The parliament gets this. The bulk of the parliament gets this. The only people in parliament who think that pensioners should prop up the profits of gas companies is the Liberal and National party who want to vote against this bill and want to vote against protecting households, businesses and jobs. It is extraordinary. Updated at 9.26pm GMT 9.09pm GMT Dutton wants market intervention unlinked from energy rebates Just to be clear – the government does not have to split the energy bill, as it has the support of both the Greens and David Pocock. But that hasn’t stopped Peter Dutton from having a crack. He wants the government to unlink the market intervention from the rebates (whatever form that will take). This is from the same party that was at one stage of its time in government threatening “a big stick” which eventually became a poking toothpick, but here we are. Dutton: We made it clear that we would provide support for a bill which includes relief to people who are seeing their power prices go up under this government but if the government blends it in with price mechanism, we won’t support that bill. Updated at 9.12pm GMT 9.03pm GMT Binance fined more than $2m for breaching spam laws Dipping out of politics for a moment Cryptocurrency platform Binance has been fined more than $2m for breaching Australia’s spam laws over emails sent without easy enough unsubscribe buttons. The platform paid $2,000,220 after the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) found Binance had sent over 5.7m commercial emails between October 2021 and May 2022 that either made it difficult for people to opt out by requiring them to log into an account, or didn’t have a way to unsubscribe. Twenty-five emails were also sent without the consent of recipients, Acma found. The emails promoted Binance’s cryptocurrency trading services or other crypto financial products. Acma chair Nerida O’Loughlin said it should be easy for customers to unsubscribe from commercial emails. Customers should not be made to log in to stop receiving messages. It is very concerning that we continue to see breaches of the spam laws from large-size companies that should have good compliance practices in place. The Spam Act has been in force since 2003, so there are simply no excuses. O’Loughlin also said it was “disappointing” Acma had warned Binance several times prior to the investigation that it might have been not compliant but the company failed to take adequate action. Binance has agreed to undertake an independent review of its e-marketing practices and train staff.

We’ll bring you some of what they have been saying very soon. Updated at 8.56pm GMT 8.49pm GMT In its two-year report into the energy market the AER has released today, the regulator talks about when power companies offer capacity power at higher costs, thereby driving up the cost of energy. Savage says that right now it is not a cause for alarm “but we’re definitely seeing some early warning lights”. Overwhelmingly this year, we’ve had unprecedented high prices and that’s what you and I were just talking about. Mostly that’s been driven by supply conditions. So you’ve had lots of discussion about the perfect storm, but we had lots of coal plant outages very high coal and gas prices, restrictions on the amount of water that Snowy Hydro is able to release and very high demand with an early winter but on top of all that, we don’t think all of those things explained the level of price increases we saw in the whole stock market this year. We have got some evidence that suggests maybe generators have been withholding some of their capacity to drive up prices a bit but it is early analysis and we do want to do some further work to test the outcome of that and how strong it is. Updated at 8.56pm GMT 8.42pm GMT Government measures will ‘help to ameliorate’ electricity bill increases The government’s legislation should mean that people save $230 on what their bill would have been without the intervention. Does Clare Savage think that sounds right? Look, I think it’s pretty early to say we’ve still got another six months or five months to go before the Australian Energy Regulator sets next year’s default market offer. And we are not talking about bill decreases. We’re talking about reductions on how much the bill would have increased but it’s very important to stress there have been a lot of pressures in the wholesale market this year. And that’s what our report out on this today talk about. But these measures will actually help to ameliorate some of that price increase. Updated at 8.45pm GMT 8.39pm GMT Energy bill already having an impact, says chair of Australian Energy Regulator The chair of the Australian Energy Regulator, Clare Savage, had a very early appearance on ABC radio this morning (thank you to our Melbourne colleague Nick Miller for listening) where she was asked about whether or not the energy bill – which will put temporary price caps on coal and gas as well as enforce a mandatory code of conduct for the gas industry – would have an impact. Savage said it already was: Well, it’s certainly a very complex space in energy at the moment. And as a regulator, I’m probably not best place to get into the ins and outs of the government’s policy. But that said, I can already see and the Australian energy regulator monitors this, the tangible impacts that these interventions are actually having in the market for electricity contracts for next year. So that’s a really great thing from a customer perspective. So how is it having that impact? Savage: So if you’re a retailer of electricity, you do buy contracts to supply your customers in advance of the year that’s coming. So for that next financial year 23/24. Since the government started talking about intervention in fuel markets in the October budget, the cost of one of those contracts has already fallen about 45 to 50% in New South Wales and Queensland. Now, I should stress that doesn’t mean we’re gonna get low retail prices next year. But it does mean if these markets keep trading as they are right now, we should see an increase next year that’s much lower than what we’d originally feared. Updated at 10.04pm GMT 8.26pm GMT See?

A very big thank you to Martin for kicking us off with the day’s news. We’ll switch to Politics Live now as Canberra fills with the determined, the cranky and the bemused. The government will be able to pass its energy legislation after the Greens and David Pocock announced they would support the bill. But that doesn’t mean we are in for an easy day. There are a lot of people who wish to make their views on this very, very clear, including the opposition, who came out of blocks pooh-poohing the national cabinet decision then complained it wasn’t consulted on the legislation (Labor went the Greens and Pocock route). Jacqui Lambie has things to say about cheaper energy bills. The house crossbench has things to say about renewables. Everyone wants to say something about their constituent’s energy bills, with business a close second. But we are on the clock here (the Senate is scheduled to sit from 1pm) so not everyone is going to get to say everything they want. And this is supposed to be a one-day wonder. Get in, pass the legislation, get out. Independent senator David Pocock – and a baby possum. Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP You’ll have Katharine Murphy – one of the nation’s leading reporters on energy – to lead the way, with Josh Butler and Daniel Hurst to assist you in all things house and Senate today. You have me, Amy Remeikis, on the blog for most of the day. It’s a treat to be back with you all, so I’ve started the day with two coffees and three Ferrero Rochers from last year’s Christmas stocking I found at the back of the linen cupboard. Desperate times, y’all. Ready? Let’s get into it. Updated at 8.34pm GMT 8.24pm GMT Robodebt inquiry to investigate department role Senior public servants involved with the failed robodebt scheme will appear before a royal commission today, Australian Associated Press reports. It comes after former prime minister Scott Morrison told the inquiry he wasn’t privy to discussions between departments that flagged the scheme as unlawful. Karen Harfield from Services Australia (formerly the Department of Social Services) and Ben Lumley from the Department of Human Services will both appear as witnesses at the Brisbane-based commission. On Wednesday, Morrison blamed departmental staff for omitting legal concerns from a policy proposal he presented to cabinet despite having signed an earlier briefing document in which concerns were raised. “Had that advice come forward I sincerely believe we would not be sitting here today,” he told the commission. Robodebt involved using individuals’ annual tax information provided by the ATO to determine average fortnightly earnings and automatically establish welfare debts, an approach ruled unlawful by the federal court in 2019. The scheme wrongly recovered more than $750m from 381,000 people and led to several people taking their lives while being pursued for false debts. Commissioner Catherine Holmes SC questioned why Morrison had not inquired further as to how the legislative issues had been resolved after they disappeared. “That is how the cabinet process works,” he replied. “I was satisfied that the department had done their job.” Former prime minister Scott Morrison is seen on a screen in the media room at the first hearing block of the royal commission into the robodebt scheme on Wednesday.

Some 54,000 students will learn the results of their Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (Atar) from 9am on Thursday, with results showing a slight improvement to marks overall. Year 12 students in NSW are getting their results today. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP It comes after results were leaked over the weekend, with students briefly able to access their results online through a student portal. The incident is being investigated by the NSW Education Standards Authority, who apologised for the mistake. Thursday’s results show 48 students receiving highest possible Atar of 99.95, including 29 boys and 19 girls, who attended a mix of public and private schools. 8.08pm GMT Government shrugs off industry opposition to energy price caps Despite weeks of strong criticism from coal and gas companies about the proposed price caps, the federal parliament will pass the government’s proposal when it returns in Canberra today. Treasurer Jim Chalmers has urged all MPs to be on the “right side” of solving the nation’s energy woes. “Today Coalition MPs around the country have a choice: they can vote for cheaper power prices and more household assistance for families and businesses doing it tough or they can vote for higher energy prices and no help for families,” he said. Crossbenchers have been surprised by the lack of direct lobbying from industry bodies who may have been “blindsided” by the reasonable pricing test introduced by ministers.

All the latest on that with my colleague Amy Remeikis in a short while but before then, here are a few stories making news overnight. Our lead story looks at a report by Wollongong university professor Philip Laird who claims that the answer to the benighted Sydney-Melbourne rail link is to upgrade and straighten around 200km of outdated track to allow medium-speed trains, thus reducing journey times from 11 hours to six. He reckons it would be a much cheaper alternative to high-speed links, could be ready in “four years”, and would also help Australia cut emissions by removing a lot of road freight. We have more great reporting on the Wieambilla shootings. In particular, details about the strict religious upbringing of Gareth and Nathaniel Train, their tangled personal lives and their father Ronald’s evangelical church are continuing to emerge. Ronald told A Current Affair last night: “I’ll stand before God for what they’ve done.” Guardian Australia’s award-winning robodebt expert, Luke Henriques-Gomes, was one of many interested parties as Scott Morrison appeared before the royal commission yesterday. Luke’s take is that the former social service minister was long on unnecessary detail and short on the sort of exact recollection about what went down that could have helped the commission. Today, Karen Harfield from Services Australia (formerly the Department of Social Services) and Ben Lumley from the Department of Human Services will appear as witnesses.","Id":"australia-news/live/2022/dec/15/australian-politics-gas-energy-cost-of-living-jim-chalmers-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-greens-adam-bandt-energy-transition-electricity-bills","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Energy bill passes – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/dec/15/australian-politics-gas-energy-cost-of-living-jim-chalmers-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-greens-adam-bandt-energy-transition-electricity-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/dec/15/australian-politics-gas-energy-cost-of-living-jim-chalmers-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-greens-adam-bandt-energy-transition-electricity-bills","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":17395,"webPublicationDate":"2022-12-15T07:46:55Z","hosted":false,"id":"australia-news/live/2022/dec/15/australian-politics-gas-energy-cost-of-living-jim-chalmers-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-greens-adam-bandt-energy-transition-electricity-bills"},{"@class":"org.project.APIArticle","head":"Interest rate rises: is there a less painful way to curb inflation?","body":"The seemingly endless series of interest rate rises by the Reserve Bank of Australia has stirred up arguments about whether monetary policy is the fairest and most effective way to curb inflation. With the RBA governor, Philip Lowe, expected to announce a record 10th consecutive rate rise on Tuesday, this debate is likely to be inflamed further. Do we rely too much on lifting rates and might alternatives work better? Here are some key points to consider. The task: getting demand and supply back into balance Put simply, inflation results when too much demand is chasing too few goods and services, pushing up prices. For decades, Australia has relied on monetary policy run by an independent central bank working in tandem with fiscal policy run by governments, particularly the commonwealth, to keep inflation in check and the economy growing. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup By the end of 2022, prices were advancing at an annual rate of almost 8%, the most since the early 1990s. Brendan Coates, the economic policy program director at the Grattan Institute, says that “it’s hard to see any policy that you could use to get bring inflation under control that doesn’t involve taking money out of the economy right now”. But he says options could include “higher interest rates, or spending cuts, or sort of a higher level for saving”. Is monetary policy ‘too blunt’? A common refrain is that the RBA’s main anti-inflation policy tool – lifting interest rates – is “too blunt”. Related: How to fight inflation? (Spoiler alert: not with interest rate rises) | Joseph Stiglitz Assuming, as the markets do, that the RBA will hike the cash rate another 25 basis points to 3.6%, a borrower on a typical $500,000 loan will be paying more than a $1,000 extra a month on their debt compared with May last year, data group Canstar says. Lowe’s predecessor Glenn Stevens argued 15 years ago that monetary policy has been mischaracterised. Sure, higher interest rates do tackle a general increase in prices, but the central bank is ill-equiped to tackle specific price shifts. “Where are the sharp instruments?” he asked. “It is not obvious that there are all that many.” Efforts by governments to increase supply – such as the Albanese government’s $20bn “rewiring the nation” plan to expand renewable energy to cut power prices – can work. “But they are long term,” Stevens said in 2008. “It is hard to deploy them in a hurry. And many of them are very general – ‘blunt’ even – rather than specific.” Is monetary policy particularly unfair? If “blunt” were taken to mean “unfair” because rate hikes target households and businesses who have debt, why aren’t there similar complaints when rates fall? “Presumably the same argument would mean that it is equally unfair to savers to put interest rates down when the economy is weak,” Stevens said. Coates says a key issue often overlooked in the fairness debate is that wealthier people tend to borrow more than those earning less – and the difference has been increasing, according to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. “Rising interest rates tends to hit higher income earners because they tend to borrow more,” Coates says. “Those are the very bottom, the poorest Australians, don’t have mortgages.” Interactive Whose job is it to fight inflation? Lowe told a House of Representatives economic committee last month that tackling inflation was “unpopular”, and hence the bank’s independence gave it an edge over politicians when it came to sapping excessive demand in the economy. “It’s easier for me to do unpopular things than it is for maybe some of you,” Lowe told MPs. “I’m not complaining. It’s our job.” Governments could cut spending but that move never goes down well with voters, says John Hawkins, a former RBA economist who now teaches at the University of Canberra. “An alternative would be to have people hand over more money to the government, by raising taxes,” Hawkins says. Scrapping or modifying the Morrison government’s stage-three tax cuts would have a similar effect, but “it is hard for the [Albanese] government to do this as it would seem like them breaking their promise”. How about compulsory savings? Besa Deda, St George Bank’s chief economist, says the challenge is to find policy alternatives that can do a better job. The interest rate rises have started to work, with inflation likely to have peaked in the December quarter and most spending measures starting to slow. In per capita terms, household spending “actually went backwards” compared with the previous quarter, she says. “I think it’s difficult to find other measures without creating distortions in the economy or without having very long lags,” Deda says. And federal budgets typically only happen once a year, compared with 11 RBA rates meetings a year. Governments could, for example, force people to save more by increasing their contribution to superannuation, but that has costs too, Coates says. “You’re probably compromising the degree to which you’re getting people to save optimally – to save the right amount for retirement.” Related: Rate rises are hitting home as real incomes fall and the economy slows. What an achievement! | Greg Jericho Hawkins notes that Arthur Fadden, Australia’s treasurer and prime minister in 1941, discussed acting on a proposal by John Maynard Keynes in the book How to Pay for the War. Fadden proposed compulsory loans that would earn 2% interest and be repaid after the second world war as a way to ease inflationary concerns. “His government, which only lasted 42 days, fell before he could implement it,” Hawkins says, adding that one potential problem of trying that policy now is that the “compulsory saving may just be offset by reductions in voluntary saving”. How about rent controls and GST hikes? Deda, who is also Westpac’s business bank economist, says customers have also been asking about the introduction of rent controls. But she says this would deter landlords from adding to housing supply, potentially pushing up rentals for those not benefiting from the controls. “By introducing that cap, what does that then do to housing supply?” she says. Hawkins agrees: “They discourage landlords from maintaining the apartments [and] in the longer term discourage their construction.” The independent senator David Pocock on Monday suggested varying the goods and services tax as a way of moderating inflation. But Hawkins says one problem is that “while a GST hike in the medium term would dampen expenditure and so lower inflation, its immediate impact would be to raise prices”. “[Another] complication is that the states were promised that the GST would not be changed without their consent.” Debate has lately flared too over the role of excessive profits in driving inflation higher, as recently assessed by the Australia Institute. The issue has also been raised by the European Central Bank, with policymakers recently showing data that company profit margins had “been increasing rather than shrinking, as might be expected when input costs rise so sharply”, Reuters reported. Breaking up unhealthy market power, though, will take time, economists said, noting that the RBA’s own charts downplay a build-up of profit’s share of the economy outside the mining sector. Central banks on ‘auto pilot’ Timo Henckel, a senior economics lecturer at the Australian National University, says central banks had largely been on “auto pilot” for the last few decades when it comes to managing inflation. Much of the period of what he called the “great moderation” for inflation could be attributed to China’s industrial expansion that sent cheap goods “in every corner of the world”, rather than being the result of “clever domestic monetary policy”. As Lowe noted in a speech last year, China was in the process of decoupling from globalism and had demographic difficulties of a shrinking population, shifts that would reduce if not reverse previously deflationary pressures. Henckel says the RBA and other central banks have also been researching how climate change and extreme weather may affect prices and supply chains. What all this means, he says, is that monetary policy looks likely to be a fertile area of debate and research for a long time to come.","Id":"australia-news/2023/mar/07/interest-rate-rises-is-there-a-less-painful-way-for-the-rba-to-curb-inflation","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Interest rate rises: is there a less painful way to curb inflation?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/07/interest-rate-rises-is-there-a-less-painful-way-for-the-rba-to-curb-inflation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/07/interest-rate-rises-is-there-a-less-painful-way-for-the-rba-to-curb-inflation","isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News","wordcount":1326,"webPublicationDate":"2023-03-06T23:52:41Z","hosted":false,"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/07/interest-rate-rises-is-there-a-less-painful-way-for-the-rba-to-curb-inflation"}]
