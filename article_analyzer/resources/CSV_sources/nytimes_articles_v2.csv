The Bush administration's new energy plan gives a place of prominence to nuclear power as a clean and efficient energy source, and the industry itself is bubbling with new hopes and plans. In truth, there are good reasons to take a fresh look at this much-maligned source of energy that has been stalled in this country for the past three decades. But it is worrisome that the administration seems to have endorsed a nuclear resurgence with little sustained analysis of its pluses and minuses. As an article by Katharine Seelye in The Times revealed last week, nuclear energy was barely in the consciousness of the drill-centric energy team at the White House until a delegation of nuclear industry executives sought a chance to make their pitch and succeeded so well that Vice President Dick Cheney almost immediately started touting the virtues of nuclear energy. A case can be made for greater exploitation of nuclear power in this country, but before the nation plunges too far down this path the administration will need to address some critical questions. The rationale for a reassessment comes partly from the performance of the industry itself, and partly from changed circumstances in the environment in which it must operate. By most accounts, the industry has learned to operate its plants more safely and efficiently than in the years leading up to the traumatic near-tragedy at Three Mile Island. American nuclear plants are operating with much greater reliability and many fewer minor incidents. Moreover, the industry is consolidating, with plants being purchased and operated by companies that have more expertise than some of the previous operators. So there is reason to trust the industry a bit more than in past decades. Meanwhile, external events are increasing the appeal of nuclear power. One is the rising concern over global warming, which is caused primarily by the emission of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. Nuclear power plants emit no carbon dioxide, thus to the extent they can replace plants burning coal, oil or natural gas they can be considered a plus. Nuclear power can also contribute to the diversity of the nation's energy supplies. Nuclear plants already supply some 20 percent of the electricity generated in this country, compared with fossil fuel contributions of 52 percent for coal, 16 percent for natural gas and 3 percent for oil. But the great majority of all new power plants are being built to burn natural gas, the cleanest of the fossil fuels, making utilities and consumers vulnerable to price spikes when supplies become tight as they have this year. President Bush's energy plan offers a wide range of steps to accelerate the use of nuclear power. But before Congress and the regulatory agencies proceed too far, some crucial questions require answers. Impact on global warming: If this is the main reason for turning to nuclear power, the proponents will need to do a much better job of spelling out just how far nuclear power would have to spread to make a real dent in the problem. Nuclear power is used almost exclusively to generate electricity, thus it cannot reduce the nation's reliance on imported oil to power transportation systems. Nuclear fuel will primarily be substituting for natural gas -- the least of the carbon dioxide emitters -- as the clean fuel to which electric utilities turn. Moreover, fossil fuels are burned in mining and preparing nuclear fuels and in building reactors, so even nuclear energy is not entirely free of greenhouse gases. Some analyses suggest that to make a real impact in slowing global warming, nuclear power plants would need to spread widely around the world, a prospect that brings new challenges of its own. Weapons risks: Expansion of nuclear power in this country poses no weapons danger, but the spread of nuclear plants into other countries could pose a risk. The uranium fuel for nuclear power plants is not generally considered of high enough grade to be used in weapons. But as more and more technicians around the world learn the skills of working with nuclear materials, and as governments become engaged in procuring nuclear technologies, there is a danger that civilian nuclear programs could serve as a cover for clandestine weapons activities. That is why, for example, the United States is angry that Russia is helping Iran build a nuclear power plant. Even though Iran has pledged to abide by nonproliferation treaties and allow international inspections of the plant, there is grave concern that it will find a way to build weapons. Increasing the use of nuclear power in countries that already have either the bomb or nuclear power plants is not much of a danger. Spreading nuclear power to additional countries might be. Waste disposal: In the political world, the lack of a proven method to store spent fuel from nuclear reactors for the tens of thousands of years the material remains radioactive has long been considered the Achilles' heel of the nuclear industry. In truth, spent fuel has been stored safely for decades in pools at the sites of nuclear power plants with no adverse effect. The problem is, the storage pools are filling up and critics are loath to expand nuclear power with no clear idea where to store the waste. The Bush administration is considering a site at Yucca Mountain in Nevada that has been studied for years, and it has proposed a new look at reprocessing the fuel to remove the long-lived plutonium for reuse as reactor fuel. That could greatly ease the storage problem here but might encourage wider use of reprocessed materials abroad, increasing the risk of weapons-grade plutonium's falling into the wrong hands. Reactor safety: The safety problem in conventional nuclear plants is that, if things start to go wrong, emergency cooling systems and human operators have to act correctly to prevent a catastrophic meltdown. That makes nuclear power a cruel and unforgiving technology that cannot tolerate equipment failures or human mistakes. But the industry is exploring new technologies that would not lead to meltdown even in a worst-case malfunction, making them inherently safer and cheaper to build and operate. This is where the administration and the industry should be focusing their efforts -- to develop demonstrably safer power plants. That would ease many of the concerns provoked by the current generation of nuclear reactors. Economics: No matter what else is done to make nuclear power more attractive, the industry will make little headway unless it can overcome the high capital costs that brought it to a halt in recent decades. Some relief should come from the advance approval of standardized designs, allowing plants to be built more quickly and cheaply than in past years when each plant had a customized design. But Congress will need to take a close look at whether it should renew one of the industry's economic underpinnings -- the so-called Price-Anderson Act that limits the liability of nuclear companies in the event of an accident. If the industry is as safe as it says, it may not need such subsidized protection. On the other hand, eliminating the liability protection might scare off investors for good. Nuclear power has been stalled for so long in the United States that it is surprising to see it back in the spotlight. There may be a case for extending the licenses of existing plants, as has already happened in several cases, or for building new plants on existing nuclear sites where the risks are already understood. But the case has not yet been made for truly large-scale expansion of nuclear power, in this country or around the globe.",2001-05-29T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,opinion

The German Parliament voted this summer to close the country’s remaining nuclear power plants by 2022, while the Swiss Parliament voted this summer to phase nuclear power out by 2034. Economic stagnation in the United States and most other industrialized economies since 2008 has produced stagnant electricity demand, further sapping interest in nuclear power. In Japan itself, the government has put on hold its plans to build further nuclear power plants, and the government faces a political battle to continue operating existing reactors. Emerging economies like Brazil and particularly India are still planning nuclear reactors. But the Indian leaders introduced legislation on Sept. 7 that is supposed to increase the independence of nuclear regulators from the industry, though critics are skeptical. That leaves China poised to build more nuclear reactors in the coming years than the rest of the world combined. But questions abound whether China will be a savior for the international nuclear power industry, or a ferocious competitor that could create even greater challenges for nuclear power companies in the West. Chinese regulators performed a four-month review of safety at all existing nuclear reactors and reactors under construction after the Fukushima meltdowns and declared them safe. Safety reviews continue at reactors where construction had not yet started at the time of the Fukushima accident. Jiang Kejun, a director of the Energy Research Institute at the National Development and Reform Commission, the top Chinese economic planning agency, said that the government was sticking to its target of 50 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2015, compared to just 10.8 gigawatts at the end of last year. Mr. Jiang said in an interview that nuclear power construction targets for 2020 had not yet been set and might end up slightly lower than they would have been without the meltdowns in Fukushima. But he and other Chinese officials say that China’s rapidly rising electricity consumption makes nuclear power essential. They even try to portray the Fukushima incidents as salutary for the nuclear power industry, a view seldom heard elsewhere. “Globally, I think Fukushima could be a good thing for nuclear power,” Mr. Jiang said. “We can learn a lot from that. We can’t be smug or too clever.” China allowed existing reactors to continue operating during the safety review from March to July and allowed construction to continue at reactors where it had already begun. Chinese regulators have also encouraged electric utilities to continue planning future nuclear power plants. But one category of reactor has been delayed by the Fukushima incident. At reactors that had been approved before the Fukushima accident but where construction had not yet begun, the government still has not allowed construction to start while continuing to study whether further safety improvements can be made, said Xu Yuanhui, one of China’s top nuclear engineers for the past half century. The delay applies to several conventional nuclear reactors plus Beijing’s project to build two reactors in northeastern China, using a new generation of technology known as a pebble-bed design. Critics and advocates describe it as safer than current reactors, though its cost-effectiveness unclear. The two reactors in Shidao, in Shandong Province in northeast China, were approved days before the Fukushima nuclear accident began with an earthquake and tsunami March 11. But the 50-month timetable for building them cannot start until the government lifts its hold on construction. “By the end of this year, maybe we’ll have some information from the government side,” Dr. Xu said. Nuclear power represented only 1.1 percent of China’s electricity generation capacity at the end of last year. With wind turbines and coal-fired power plants being installed at rates that far surpass those in any other country, nuclear power is on track to account for no more than 4 percent of electricity capacity by 2015. A big part of the appeal of nuclear energy for Chinese officials is that it supplies baseload power, meaning it is available 24 hours a day and seven days a week to meet needs. China passed the United States last year as the world’s largest installer of wind turbines, but wind still accounts for only 3.2 percent of China’s installed electricity generation capacity and less than 2 percent of electricity generated. Coal remains by far the dominant source of electricity in China, producing three-quarters of the country’s electricity. Nuclear power mainly displaces coal as a source of baseload power. That has also made it popular with Chinese officials, as they have set increasingly ambitious targets to slow the country’s rapid rise in emissions of global warming gases, in which the country already leads the world. Until reliable, large-scale storage of electricity is perfected for renewable energy sources like the wind and sun, “they’ve got to continue using nuclear as a fundamental part of their fuel mix,” said James A. Maguire, the regional managing director for Asian infrastructure at Aon Risk Solutions, a risk management and insurance broker. Coal is the most polluting major source of electricity in terms of emissions of climate-changing gases, while nuclear power is one of the cleanest. Coal mining accidents also kill more than 2,000 people a year in China, and large areas of the countryside in northern China have been heavily polluted. China is paying particular attention to nuclear safety issues, however, because it has some of the world’s most densely populated rural areas. If a nuclear accident rendered even a small area around a power plant uninhabitable, many would need to be resettled. China now has an unusually varied fleet of nuclear reactors, using French, American, Russian and homegrown technology. While awarding contracts to a wide range of multinational nuclear power plant contractors, it has required that they provide documentation on exactly how to build the reactors. That will give China the ability to export reactors in a few years, in competition with industrialized nations, nuclear power industry experts warned. Demand outside China could revive if memories of the Fukushima accident fade or if worries about global warming become more pressing. China is not only acquiring technology. It is also creating economies of scale by building dozens of reactors at the same time. As a population equal to New York City’s moves into China’s cities each year demanding air-conditioners and other electricity-guzzling conveniences, consumption is likely to continue growing by double digits. “It’s the largest migration in history, so they need to build a lot of infrastructure,” said Dennis Bracy, the chief executive of the U.S.-China Clean Energy Forum, a bilateral discussion group formed by the Chinese government with prominent Americans from previous Republican and Democratic administrations. “I believe they will stay with nuclear as part of the portfolio.”",2011-10-11T00:31:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

The nuclear industry thought this was a glaring omission, and a handful of top nuclear industry officials decided they needed to take their case to the administration. In mid-March, a cadre of seven nuclear power executives sought and won an hourlong meeting in the White House with Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's top political adviser. Also attending were Lawrence B. Lindsey, the president's top economic adviser, Andrew Lundquist, the executive director of Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force, and others involved in devising the energy plan. ''We said, Look, we are an important player on this energy team and here are our vital statistics, and we think that you should start talking about nuclear when you talk about increasing the nation's supply,'' Christian H. Poindexter, chairman of the Constellation Energy Group, recalled today. And then a surprising thing happened. ''It was shortly after that, as a matter of fact I think the next night, when the vice president was being interviewed on television, he began to talk about nuclear power for the first time,'' Mr. Poindexter said. Mr. Cheney first discussed nuclear power as an alternative to dirtier fossil fuels in a March 21 interview on CNBC. ''If you want to do something about carbon dioxide emissions,'' he said, ''then you ought to build nuclear power plants because they don't emit any carbon dioxide, they don't emit greenhouse gases.'' Mr. Cheney had missed the meeting with nuclear executives because he was on Capitol Hill, talking to members of Congress who themselves were pushing nuclear energy. In a quick chain reaction, Mr. Cheney put the long-maligned nuclear power industry back on the political map. In the energy plan released last week, the administration breathed new life into the industry, declaring nuclear technology, which provides 20 percent of the nation's electricity, much safer than it was 20 years ago. Today, Mr. Cheney appeared before 350 nuclear industry executives meeting in Washington -- 100 more than showed up at last year's annual meeting of the Nuclear Energy Institute -- and told them the administration wanted to encourage the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to expedite applications for new reactors, relicense existing plants and ''increase the resources devoted to safety and enforcement as we prepare to increase nuclear generating capacity in the future.'' He said the administration also wanted to renew the Price-Anderson Act, which limits nuclear plant operators' liability in case of an accident. Mr. Poindexter is still incredulous. ''In my wildest dreams, when I was over at the White House in March, I couldn't imagine them getting so behind us,'' he said. He was skeptical for good reason. Few industries have enjoyed the kind of renaissance that nuclear power may be poised to undergo. Accidents at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and Chernobyl in Ukraine seemed to seal the industry's fate as too dangerous, too uncontrollable and too expensive to win back a frightened public or secure the financial backing of Wall Street. The last nuclear power plant to enter operation was ordered in 1973. There still is no solution to the vexing problem of nuclear waste storage. And while recent polling shows that Americans more lopsidedly oppose dirtier fossil fuels than they oppose nuclear power, they still do not want to live near nuclear power plants. For those wary of a nuclear revival, these problems are no less real today than they were two decades ago. ''The Bush administration should at most be looking to proceed with what the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was planning -- an orderly phase-out of existing power plants,'' said Paul L. Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute and co-director of the Senate investigation into the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island. ''Instead, they're talking about a new rebirth, and it frankly just doesn't make sense.'' The Union of Concerned Scientists, using data from the industry itself, says that aging plants have experienced eight forced shutdowns in the last 16 months. And Mr. Leventhal said that replacing coal with nuclear power would not appreciably diminish global warming because most of the pollutants that cause global warming come from cars and trucks. Another problem, and one that Mr. Cheney fully acknowledges, is the lack of a national repository for the storage of nuclear waste. In his speech today, the vice president warned that the lack of a storage site could be a deal killer. Without a site, he said, ''eventually the contribution we can count on from the nuclear industry will, in fact, decline.'' The storage problem will not be solved at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, if Nevada politicians and the gambling industry have anything to say about it. Senators Harry Reid, a Democrat, and John Ensign, a Republican, have made opposition to nuclear waste dumping in their state their priority. ''Until they get the waste problem solved,'' Mr. Reid said, ''nothing's going to happen on nuclear power.'' Peter Bradford, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, who now teaches energy policy at Yale, said that apart from the safety issues, nuclear power was economically problematic. ''The types of long-term investment necessary to sustain nuclear energy are going to prove very hard to find in this kind of volatile marketplace,'' Mr. Bradford said. Still, there are cheerleaders. One is Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who heads the Energy and Commerce Committee. He spoke today at the Nuclear Energy Institute's annual meeting and summed up the surprise that others feel at the recent turn of events. ''As we gather here in Washington,'' Mr. Tauzin said, ''who would have thunk that we'd be discussing the possibility of nuclear construction in this country?''",2001-05-23T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

The president had good reason to suggest an important role for this much-feared energy source. The price of natural gas, the current fuel of choice for power plants, has risen sharply. And there is mounting evidence that damage from global warming may dwarf any environmental risk posed by nuclear power. It is therefore critical to keep nuclear power as part of the nation's energy mix. But Mr. Bush will have to address some crucial concerns before the public will follow him down the nuclear path with much enthusiasm. For starters, there is the awkward fact that nuclear power plants pose a risk of proliferating the materials and skills to make nuclear weapons. That is not an issue in the United States, which already has a mammoth nuclear arsenal. But if the United States resurrects its stagnant nuclear industry, other nations may also turn to nuclear power, with the risk that rogue nations may someday use the fuel to make bombs. The Bush administration will need to find ways, perhaps through the nuclear nonproliferation review that started yesterday, to ensure that power plants do not become an easy route to nuclear weapons. Beyond that, Mr. Bush will need to ensure that the pools holding spent fuel at domestic nuclear plants can be made safe from terrorists. He will have to devise a backup plan for storing nuclear waste, should the proposed burial site at Yucca Mountain prove untenable after legal and regulatory setbacks. He will need to invest in new, potentially safer reactor designs to allay longstanding concerns about accidents. Finally, one familiar impediment to nuclear power -- the high capital costs required up front -- could remain troublesome, unless the cost of competing fuels soars higher. None of these concerns need rule out this promising source of power. But they will need to be addressed forthrightly. Editorial",2005-05-04T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,opinion

That should not be surprising. Since they derive from human knowledge, their effective application must be learned, and they compete for social and economic territory. Nuclear power, a product of naval propulsion research, emerged in the United States in the 1950's. Its first use as a commercial energy source came about because it had obvious benefits for pollution control. A Pennsylvania utility, Duquesne Light, built the first commercial nuclear power reactor at Shippingport, Pa., in 1954. The utility had planned to build a coal-fired power plant. When the public objected to further smoke pollution around smoky Pittsburgh, Duquesne switched to nuclear power. Public acceptance of a new technology is essential to its growth. Nuclear power, associated in the public's mind with nuclear weapons, was probably commercialized prematurely, while its complexities were still being worked out. Its environmental benefits were not fully appreciated in the early decades because air pollution was abating under government regulation in the 1960's and 1970's, and global warming had not yet emerged as the ultimate environmental challenge. When conservation slowed electricity demand after the Arab oil embargo of 1973 and 1974, utilities canceled orders for new power plants, both nuclear and coal. Almost all new plants built since then have been fueled with natural gas. But the population of the United States is growing, adding the equivalent of one California every 10 years. Demand has caught up with supply even with significant improvements in energy efficiency and conservation, and the United States has become the world's leading greenhouse gas emitter. These factors make a renewal of nuclear power likely. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has begun carefully extending licenses for existing reactors for an additional 20 years; eventually all 104 operating United States power reactors will probably be relicensed. Since they produce no air pollution or greenhouse gases, that's good news. The nuclear industry is consolidating, focusing experience and expertise. Several reactors that have been shut down will probably be restored to operation. Several others that were left unfinished when demand slowed will probably be completed. Two or three new advanced light-water reactors, designs the N.R.C. has already pre-licensed, will probably be built at sites that already have construction permits. One company, Exelon, is considering seeking licensing of a simpler reactor, designed so that it cannot melt down, that uses a bed of billiard-ball-sized ''pebbles'' of compacted uranium oxide and graphite as its fuel and helium as its coolant and working fluid, passing the fission-heated helium directly into a turbine to generate electricity even more cheaply than burning natural gas. If the pebble-bed modular reactor wins approval from the N.R.C., other utilities may decide to use this technology as well. Americans are beginning to understand one of the unique benefits of nuclear technology. A majority now say they approve of nuclear power, a shift that appears to indicate awareness that nuclear power does not produce greenhouse gases that lead to global warming. There is less evidence of public understanding of radiation and nuclear waste. Antinuclear activism began in the 1960's with concerns about the disposal of nuclear waste, and disposal continues to be the nuclear industry's Number 1 public-relations problem. The disposal debate is likely to move to center stage later this year, when the scientists and engineers evaluating Yucca Mountain, north of Las Vegas, as a possible permanent waste repository expect to deliver their final report. All energy technologies produce waste. Burning fossil fuels -- even relatively clean fuel like natural gas -- generates waste that cannot be contained within the power plant, as nuclear waste is, but must be released into the environment as air pollution and toxic waste. In the case of coal, burning releases ash that is mildly radioactive, because radioactive uranium and thorium are ubiquitous in the earth's crust, including coal seams. Even renewable technologies like wind power and solar photovoltaics produce waste: manufacturing the materials for the multitude of collectors necessary to gather up such diffuse sources as wind and sunlight requires burning fossil fuels. Thus wind or solar power systems release far more greenhouse gases across their life cycles than does a nuclear system of equivalent output. The great advantage of nuclear power is its ability to wrest enormous energy from a small volume of fuel. One metric ton of nuclear fuel produces energy equivalent to two million to three million tons of fossil fuel. Waste volumes are comparably scaled: fossil fuel systems generate hundreds of thousands of metric tons of gaseous, particulate and solid wastes, but nuclear systems produce less than 1,000 metric tons of high- and low-level waste per plant per year. The high-level waste is intensely radioactive at first, but its small volume means it can be and is effectively isolated and contained. When a nuclear plant is dismantled (few have been so far), the several hundred thousand tons of concrete, which is mildly radioactive, is buried in the same sort of commercial waste site used for radioactive medical and industrial wastes. Spent nuclear fuel loses radioactivity steadily; after 500 years it is no more radioactive than high-grade uranium ore. The risk of radioactive waste's seeping past multiple barriers would be small compared to health risks posed by air pollution from burning fossil fuels, which the World Health Organization estimates causes three million deaths a year, with 15,000 deaths annually in the United States from coal particulates alone. Substituting small, sequestered volumes of nuclear waste for vast, dispersed volumes of toxic wastes from fossil fuels could provide an enormous improvement in public health. The other risk that nuclear power supposedly raises is nuclear proliferation. In fact, no nation has developed nuclear weapons using plutonium from spent power reactor fuel. It's much easier to make weapons from plutonium bred specifically for that purpose. Inspection and proper accounting and control of nuclear materials are the answer to proliferation, not limits to nuclear power. France once burned coal; that nation's electricity is now 80 percent nuclear, with five times less air pollution and with carbon dioxide emissions 10 times lower than Germany's and 13 times lower than Denmark's. At a conference recently in Japan (another nuclear leader, with 36 percent nuclear electricity), French nuclear industry executive Anne Lanvergeon proposed improving the debate about nuclear power by creating an authoritative world database that would assess the advantages and disadvantages of each type of energy in terms of use of resources and economic, environmental and health impact. Measured against other energy sources, nuclear power would emerge at the top of such a list. Energy needs in the United States will grow in the coming decades, even with improved efficiency and more strenuous conservation. Nuclear energy needs to be a major component of our energy supply if we hope both to reduce air pollution and limit global warming.

As the nuclear weapon programs of North Korea, Pakistan, Israel, India and perhaps Iran have shown, civilian nuclear power programs are inextricably linked with the technology needed to develop nuclear weapons. We cannot promote nuclear power as a source of electricity and also expect to prevent nuclear weapon proliferation, a development that poses as great a threat to humanity as global warming. Furthermore, nuclear power is not an inexpensive bridge to an energy system based on renewable sources. It competes for resources with renewables, diverting money from the very technologies we need to promote. Numerous studies provide blueprints for replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources more cheaply and quickly than nuclear power can. It is time to abandon the myth of the peaceful atom and focus on building a renewable energy system that meets the needs of all people. CATHERINE THOMASSON IRA HELFAND Leeds, Mass., May 3, 2014  The writers are, respectively, executive director of Physicians for Social Responsibility and co-president of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, which received the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize. To the Editor: You are correct that there needs to be a rational balance between the risks of technology and the ultimate benefit, which in the case of nuclear power is supplying electricity while reducing the effect of climate change. The case for nuclear, as you say, lies in the drawbacks of the competition. There is no magic energy source despite how green the alternatives are. Where power is needed, there is only insufficient and intermittent wind and sun, and a real challenge to compete economically. Nuclear does need prudence, which has been well demonstrated in the United States, with reactors meeting exceptional safety standards. Independent, strict regulation works to make nuclear safe. It will allow nuclear power to make its contribution to controlling both polluting emissions and climate change. MICHAEL CORRADINI Madison, Wis., May 3, 2014  The writer is a professor of nuclear engineering and engineering physics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. To the Editor: You do an excellent job of summing up the case for nuclear power. One critical point, however, is missing. The main reason that “competition from cheap natural gas” is a factor in the shutdown of nuclear plants is that the price of natural gas does not include externalities: the costs of the damage it causes to the environment by contributing to climate change. These are costs that society will have to bear in the future and that will only grow with time. And while natural gas causes less climate damage than coal, it is nevertheless unacceptable. Unless we tax carbon emissions, either directly or through a cap-and-trade system, the economic incentives for making the right choices will remain distorted. That is something we cannot afford. ZVI J. DORON Pittsburgh, May 2, 2014 The writer is a retired nuclear engineer and co-author of a book (in German) about energy and climate policies. To the Editor: You belittle “unfounded fears of using nuclear power.” To avoid nuclear power in the future is not an “unfounded fear” but a considered judgment based on nuclear disasters in three countries. Those demonstrate that we cannot trust the engineers and managers with the responsibility required. The only sensible way forward is to adhere to greater prudence than you advocate: Require that all new and replacement energy come solely from renewable sources.

By Joseph A. Camilleri. 347 pp. Seattle: University of Washington Press. $25. THE debate over nuclear power has aroused intense feelings, but few attempts have been made to explain why. Joseph A. Camilleri, a senior lecturer in politics at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia, sets out to correct this situation. In his well-documented ''The State and Nuclear Power,'' he argues that the underlying cause of the public's disaffection with nuclear power has been the nature and extent of government intervention in its development and use, rather than the ostensible issues around which the debate has raged - weapons proliferation, waste disposal, reactor safety. He examines government's role in six countries - the United States, France, West Germany, Britain, Sweden and Brazil - that each developed different approaches to nuclear power. And he is able to show that the pace of development and the intensity of the debate differed from country to country. France, with its highly centralized political system and its commitment to an independent nuclear weapons program, took a more aggressive approach than West Germany, which had no weapons program and a less centralized government. By 1981, as a result, 40 percent of France's electricity was nuclear- generated - three times the proportion in the United States, Britain, or West Germany. In the United States and Britain, nuclear planning was at first closely related to military planning; civilian programs were developed as an afterthought or as a means of obscuring or popularizing the decision to acquire nuclear weapons. In America, opposition to nuclear power first focused on concerns about reactor safety and waste management. This opposition was intensified by fears that the nuclear authorities had been less than frank with the public about the dangers involved. By the early 1970's, these concerns were reinforced by questions about the economic viability of nuclear power. Opposition to nuclear power in Europe was more ideological than in America, but it was also provoked by dubious power plant economics and deceptive government propaganda. On both sides of the Atlantic, the antinuclear movement increasingly questioned one important rationale for government involvement with nuclear power - the need to support economic growth by expanding and centralizing energy supplies. Mr. Camilleri argues that the dispute about nuclear power is part of a larger conflict of values - an ''ideological confrontation between the center, which controls the productive process and uses the welfare state as the basis of capital accumulation, and the periphery sensitive to the destructive impact of the profit motivated post industrial system.'' These concerns and the unfavorable economic outlook of the late 70's and early 80's made it difficult to maintain momentum behind nuclear programs. How much of the public's concern was attributable to changing economic conditions and how much to safety, waste management or broader ideological issues? To what extent did pressure for tighter regulations cause nuclear power plant economics to deteriorate? My reading of the American experience is that constantly changing and often conflicting regulatory policy was an important cause of the rising costs of nuclear plants. But Mr. Camilleri provides little evidence to help us sort this out. ANOTHER area that requires attention is the appropriate role of government in simultaneously promoting and regulating a new technology. Certainly, Congress, the State and Energy Departments and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission rarely develop a consistent point of view; and this is probably healthy. Unfortunately, there are few mechanisms for resolving conflicts between agencies. Consequently, the nuclear industry finds it difficult to make the long-term commitments necessary to compete successfully. The public, on the other hand, becomes suspicious when it senses a reluctance on the part of the bureaucracy to deal with regulatory issues. Regrettably, ''The State and Nuclear Power'' is not a good guide for managing future technological change. Even though the development of nuclear power cannot be judged a success so far, there are undoubtedly lessons we can learn from the experience. Mr. Camilleri helps us to understand the relationship between governments and the scientific and industrial communities. If he fails to offer guidance for the future, he has set the stage for others to do so.",1985-02-17T07:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,book-review-desk-books-book-review

Pataki should require all relevant state agencies to complete a full public review of nuclear safety before exposing nuclear power to market competition or considering the sale of any of New York's six commercial nuclear power plants.

A white paper on energy policy released after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday said that the government planned to have 40 gigawatts of nuclear power capacity installed by 2015, and pledged strict safety standards. While the white paper and state-controlled media did not describe this as a reduction in the target, the country’s current Five-Year Plan sets a target of 50 gigawatts. Jiang Kejun, a director of the Energy Research Institute at the National Development and Reform Commission, the top Chinese economic planning agency, reaffirmed the target of 50 gigawatts in an interview in October 2011. That was when China resumed construction of nuclear power plants after a six-month hiatus following the Fukushima accident, which occurred after a tsunami flooded the Japanese nuclear power plant. China had 12.54 gigawatts of installed capacity of nuclear power plants at the end of last year, the white paper said. So the new, lower target still involves more than tripling current electricity generation from nuclear power. “China will invest more in nuclear power technological innovations, promote application of advanced technology, improve the equipment level, and attach great importance to personnel training,” the white paper said. The International Atomic Energy Agency and even Chinese regulators had expressed concern more than a year before the Fukushima accident that China’s nuclear power program was expanding so fast that it lacked enough skilled personnel to run so many reactors safely. While China’s military nuclear facilities tend to be deep in the country’s interior, a decision by the former leader Mao Zedong to help protect them from foreign attack, China has tended to build civilian nuclear reactors at isolated coastal locations — on peninsulas, where possible. According to Chinese nuclear engineers, that has been done to minimize the number of people nearby who might need to be evacuated in case of a serious accident, and to reduce the risk of contamination to supplies of fresh water. Before the Fukushima accident, the government had been planning to build civilian reactors in seven inland provinces as well, so the reactors would be close to large centers of electricity demand. Plans have been delayed, the government announced on Wednesday. Nuclear power generates only 1.8 percent of China’s electricity, far below the global average of 14 percent.",2012-10-25T07:30:17.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-global-business

A year after the Chernobyl disaster sent a cloud of radioactive debris drifting across much of Western Europe, those European countries already committed to nuclear power are pushing ahead with their nuclear programs. Britain has just authorized construction of the first of a new generation of nuclear power reactors. West Germany recently started up a new reactor, its twenty-first. France - which leads the world by meeting 70 percent of its electrical consumption needs with nuclear energy - continues to build new reactors at a rate of about one every 18 months. Overall, Western Europe gets about one third of its electric power from nuclear reactors. Radiation levels have returned to normal over most of the continent, though the sale of reindeer meat and freshwater fish from northern Scandanavia is still banned. Pierre Pellerin, director of France's Central Protection Service Against Ion Radiation, asserted that ''the effect on European public health is rigorously nil.'' In a report prepared for the European Community last month, however, Britain's National Radiological Protection Board said the Chernobyl accident may cause up to 1,000 cancer deaths in Western Europe over the next 70 years, although the percentage seems small when compared with the the 60 million cancer deaths that would have been expected. Changes in Attitudes Yet Chernobyl appears to have significantly affected Western European attitudes toward nuclear power. Opposition to nuclear power has hardened in many European countries. The Italian Parliament has halted work on the country's four unfinished reactors. Finland, Holland and Greece have canceled or postponed plans to acquire new reactors since Chernobyl. Sweden, which had already committed to abandoning nuclear power by 2010, now plans to shut a first reactor by 1995 and a second by 1996. And in nations that retain a commitment to nuclear energy, left-wing political parties have grown more adamant in their anti-nuclear statements, raising the possibility of a policy change if they come to power. Britain's Labor Party proposes to phase out nuclear power over several decades. West Germany's Social Democrats want to abolish it within 10 years. All Italian parties to the left of the Christian Democrats, the country's largest party, oppose nuclear power. Only in France is there still an all-party consensus in favor. ''For the first time a serious nuclear accident has become a real, not a theoretical, possibility,'' said I. C. Bupp, the author of a new study on nuclear power after Chernobyl. ''That's bound to affect attitudes.'' No Technical Changes Investigations by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris concluded that the Chernobyl accident was specific to a particular type of Soviet reactor and did not call into question the safety of Western reactors. ''No new safety measures were needed on Western reactors,'' said Thomas Roser of the Deutsches Atom Forum, a body representing Germany's atomic industry. As for reactors under construction, the impact of Chernobyl was lessened by the fact that the number of of reactors proposed or in progress has declined, since there is little demand for more electricity. West Germany has only three reactors still under construction. But in West Germany, authorities in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia are still blocking the start-up of a nearly completed reactor at Kalkar. France's latest reactor at Cattenom on its eastern frontier has provoked large and violent West German protests. While recent opinion polls show that West Germany's existing nuclear power plants now command the same majority support they enjoyed before Chernobyl, they also show rising opposition to building any new nuclear reactors in the future. Although Britain's Conservative Government is pushing ahead with construction of Sizewell B, the first of a planned series of new-model reactors, political opposition to the program appears strong at the local level and there are signs that the Government is quietly scaling back its plans. French Consensus Wavers Even France's traditional political consensus in favor of nuclear power has been shaken by recent accidents at its Super Phenix fast breeder reactor and at a uranium enrichment plant. The opposition Socialists have demanded the creation of an independent commission to oversee safety at nuclear plants and the leading trade union has called for Super Phenix to be shut down until the cause of a leak is found. A recent poll found that 53 percent of the French questioned would try to move if a nuclear power station were built nearby. With Europe's power needs now largely satisfied it is only in the mid 1990's that a significant new demand for generating capacity is expected to arise. Siemens, West Germany's biggest nuclear reactor constructor, and France's state-owned nuclear constructor both believe that new demand for nuclear power stations will develop then. But other experts like Mr. Bupp think Chernobyl has produced ''a subtle shift'' in attitudes toward nuclear power among politicians and business executives. He predicts that Europe will gradually follow the example of the United States, where the last new reactor order was placed in 1973, and move toward natural gas and coal-fired electrical generators.",1987-04-27T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

As the 1990's begin, the nuclear power industry and its most vocal critics agree that the United States faces a new energy shortage, but they remain at odds over the role that nuclear power should play in averting a crisis. In a report assessing nuclear power in the last decade, environmental groups contend that the industry has not proven it can stand on its own economically or deal with the problems of safety and waste disposal. The report, ''A Decade of Decline: The Degeneration of Nuclear Power in the 1980's and the Emergence of Safer Energy Alternatives,'' was made public on Thursday. It was prepared by Ralph Nader's Public Citizen organization on behalf of several dozen environmental and anti-nuclear power groups around the country. New Fuel Shortage Looms The makings of an energy shortage in the new decade are not in dispute. Domestic oil production has fallen 13 percent since the Arab oil embargo in 1973, and oil imports have taken up the slack. Moreover, the possibility of global warming, which is caused the burning of fossil fuels and depletes the ozone layer, poses a potential threat to the environment and could force the nation to restrict the use of oil, coal and natural gas. ''The nuclear industry is now seeking to exploit this situation by portraying itself as the solution to the nation's energy and environmental woes,'' the report said. Despite the promises of nuclear power, critics contend, the industry has grown more costly, safety has not improved and the problem of radioactive waste has not been solved. Responding to the report, proponents of nuclear plants said in interviews that as the cost of imported oil rises and domestic production shrinks, the industry will become more competitive and part of the solution to the energy crisis. But serious obstacles remain. In the last decade there were no orders for new nuclear reactors. Documents obtained from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department of Energy show that eight licensed reactors were closed and 60 that had been ordered or were under construction were cancelled. At the same time the cost of construction for new plants, not accounting for inflation, rose from $1,135 per kilowatt in 1980 to $4,590 in 1989, the report said. The cost of most ''renewable'' sources of energy, like hydroelectric, solar and wind power, declined, and their electric generating capacity grew by 27 percent, producing more power than nuclear plants. New Plants Said to Be Cheaper But industry officials say that the financial picture is improving and that in some cases nuclear power is cheaper than other sources. ''Of course, the viable option is going to depend upon economics,'' said Richard Slember, vice president of Energy Systems at the Westinghouse Corporation, one of the nation's largest manufacturers of commercial nuclear reactors. The current generation of plants is cheaper, more efficient and much safer than previous designs, Mr. Slember said. Plants that began operating in the 1980's were expensive because of high interest rates, exorbitant construction costs and new safety requirements after the accident at Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, said Cathy Steel Roche, media director at the United States Council for Energy Awareness, the industry's main trade organization. ''With those costs now under control, our belief is that nuclear power will be economically competitive.'' The major stumbling block to the wider use of nuclear power, the industry contends, is not the plants but the regulatory process that has forced them to sit idle. ''It's going to take some sort of crisis,'' said John Sillin of the Management Analysis Company in Washington, a consulting firm to the nuclear industry. ''The state licensing commissions will only come around when the brownouts continue and get worse.'' But the report said the public is most concerned because it thinks the plants are neither safe nor reliable. Indeed, public support for nuclear power withered after the incidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl in the Soviet Union.",1990-01-02T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

Toshiba beat competing bids from General Electric, Hitachi and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and it is in exclusive talks with Westinghouse, this person said. Westinghouse, based in Monroeville, Pa., is controlled by British Nuclear Fuels, which in turn is controlled by the British government. Mitsubishi made an offer of more than $2.5 billion for Westinghouse last summer, and The Wall Street Journal reported last week that G.E. and Hitachi had teamed up to make a $3.5 billion bid. But Toshiba made a last-minute, higher offer, the person said. Nuclear energy is gaining support with governments around the world amid high oil and natural gas prices, tight petroleum supplies and growing demand for electricity. Technology by Westinghouse is found in half the world's operating commercial nuclear power plants, according to the company's Web site. The company has 8,500 employees. Since the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, no new nuclear power-plants have been built in the United States. Opponents of nuclear power say the 1986 explosion of the Chernobyl power plant in Ukraine and the problems associated with the disposal of waste fuel illustrate the dangers of nuclear energy for the environment. But elsewhere, nuclear energy never lost the favor of governments who view it as a reliable source of energy. Even in the United States, the appeal of nuclear power has risen as prices for natural gas and coal, which power most of America's power plants, have risen in recent months. Energy companies are seeking licenses around the country to build new power plants, notably in Alabama and Mississippi. The Bush administration, which is also encouraging the development of nuclear energy as a way to reduce dependence on foreign energy sources, is seeking to streamline the application process and permits needed to build new plants. British Nuclear bought Westinghouse's nuclear business from the CBS Corporation for $1.1 billion in 1999, ridding the company of its last industrial vestige. The sale completed the transformation of what was once called the Westinghouse Electric Corporation into a media conglomerate. The sale of Westinghouse to a Japanese company may raise security concerns at a time when Iran is seeking to develop a nuclear program of its own. Worldwide, there are 443 nuclear plants used for electricity generation in 31 countries, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute. Of these, 103 are in the United States, where they account for about a fifth of power production. Twenty-four new nuclear plants are under construction in 10 countries.",2006-01-23T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,national-desk

Until this weekend, President Obama, mainstream environmental groups and large numbers of Republicans and Democrats in Congress agreed that nuclear power offered a steady energy source and part of the solution to climate change, even as they disagreed on virtually every other aspect of energy policy. Mr. Obama is seeking tens of billions of dollars in government insurance for new nuclear construction, and the nuclear industry in the United States, all but paralyzed for decades after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, was poised for a comeback. Now, that is all in question as the world watches the unfolding crisis in Japan’s nuclear reactors and the widespread terror it has spawned. “I think it calls on us here in the U.S., naturally, not to stop building nuclear power plants but to put the brakes on right now until we understand the ramifications of what’s happened in Japan,” Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut and one of the Senate’s leading voices on energy, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” Nuclear power, which still suffers from huge economic uncertainties and local concerns about safety, had been growing in acceptance as what appeared to many to be a relatively benign, proven and (if safe and permanent storage for wastes could be arranged) nonpolluting source of energy for the United States’ future growth. But even staunch supporters of nuclear power are now advocating a pause in licensing and building new reactors in the United States to make sure that proper safety and evacuation measures are in place. Environmental groups are reassessing their willingness to see nuclear power as a linchpin of any future climate change legislation. Mr. Obama still sees nuclear power as a major element of future American energy policy, but he is injecting a new tone of caution into his endorsement. “The president believes that meeting our energy needs means relying on a diverse set of energy sources that includes renewables like wind and solar, natural gas, clean coal and nuclear power,” said Clark Stevens, a White House spokesman. “Information is still coming in about the events unfolding in Japan, but the administration is committed to learning from them and ensuring that nuclear energy is produced safely and responsibly here in the U.S.” Three of the world’s chief sources of large-scale energy production — coal, oil and nuclear power — have all experienced eye-popping accidents in just the past year. The Upper Big Branch coal mine explosion in West Virginia, the Deepwater Horizon blowout and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the unfolding nuclear crisis in Japan have dramatized the dangers of conventional power generation at a time when the world has no workable alternatives able to operate at sufficient scale. The policy implications for the United States are vexing. “It’s not possible to achieve a climate solution based on existing technology without a significant reliance on nuclear power,” said Jason Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington and an energy and climate change adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign. “It’s early to reach many conclusions about what happened in Japan and the relevance of what happened to the United States. But the safety of nuclear power will certainly be high on the list of questions for the next several months.” “The world is fundamentally a set of relative risks,” Mr. Grumet added, noting the confluence of disasters in coal mining, oil drilling and nuclear plant operations. “The accident certainly has diminished what had been a growing impetus in the environmental community to support nuclear power as part of a broad bargain on energy and climate policy.” Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, said that the United States should not overreact to the Japanese nuclear crisis by clamping down on the domestic industry indefinitely. Republicans have loudly complained that the Obama administration did just that after the BP oil spill last spring when it imposed a moratorium on deepwater oil drilling until new safety and environmental rules were written. “I don’t think right after a major environmental catastrophe is a very good time to be making American domestic policy,” Mr. McConnell said on “Fox News Sunday.” He said that the American public and politicians had recoiled after Three Mile Island, rejecting permits for the construction of dozens of nuclear plants on the “not in my backyard” impulse. “My thought about it is, we ought not to make American and domestic policy based upon an event that happened in Japan,” Mr. McConnell said. Mr. Obama has been as supportive of nuclear power as any recent president as he has tried to devise a political and technical strategy for ensuring energy supplies and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Nuclear power, along with expanded offshore oil drilling, “clean coal” development and extensive support for renewable energy, are part of his “all-of-the-above energy strategy,” an approach and terminology borrowed from Republicans. But his support for coal and oil as part of a grand compromise on energy were set back by last year’s mining and drilling disasters, and today’s problems with nuclear in Japan cannot help. Concerns about earthquakes and nuclear power have been around for a long time; new questions might also be raised now about tsunamis and coastal reactors. In Mr. Obama’s State of the Union address and in his budget, he proposed an expansion of nuclear energy technology and $36 billion in Department of Energy loan guarantees for the construction of as many as 20 new nuclear plants. That policy will be on the table at a hearing of the Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday, when Steven Chu, the energy secretary, and Gregory B. Jaczko, chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, are scheduled to testify. “We will use that opportunity to explore what is known in the early aftermath of the damage to Japanese nuclear facilities,” said Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan, the committee chairman, “as well as to reiterate our unwavering commitment to the safety of U.S. nuclear sites.” Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and a skeptic of nuclear power who nonetheless supported expansion of nuclear power as part of the House energy and climate legislation he co-sponsored, said the United States needed tougher standards for siting and operating nuclear plants. He said regulators should consider a moratorium on locating nuclear plants in seismically active areas, require stronger containment vessels in earthquake-prone regions and thoroughly review the 31 plants in the United States that use similar technology to the crippled Japanese reactors. “The unfolding disaster in Japan must produce a seismic shift in how we address nuclear safety here in America,” Mr. Markey said.",2011-03-14T00:27:14.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-science-environment
c90d90ad-cfc8-566f-8989-42521bdfa5c0,https://www.tipsproject.eu/tips/,Of Climate Change and Nuclear Power,"Nuclear power should play an essential role in our efforts to mitigate climate change, argues Stewart Brand, the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog and longtime environmental activist. Mr. Brand, a professed “eco-pragmatist,” makes the case for nuclear power in his latest book, “ The Whole Earth Discipline ,” where he draws on the work of several scientists, including Saul Griffith , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-trained material scientist and inventor. While acknowledging that nuclear power is not without its own environmental risks, Mr. Brand said his bigger concern is the damage caused by coal-burning power plants. To mitigate this damage, he argues we must cut our fossil fuel use to a fraction of today’s levels over the next 25 years. Renewables, energy efficiency and conservation will play their parts in our future clean-energy portfolio, Mr. Brand said, but given the 25-year time frame, technologies like wind, solar and biofuels cannot supply enough reliable, consistent electric power to take enough fossil fuel plants offline. “The vileness of nuclear weapons easily smears over to nuclear energy, and there you have it,” Mr. Brand wrote in an e-mail message. “Emotion replaces thought and practicality.” Not everyone agrees that it’s purely an emotional issue. Amory Lovins, a physicist and the chief scientist at the Rocky Mountain Institute , wrote a polite, but detailed dissection of Brand’s position last week: Today, most dispassionate analysts think new nuclear power plants’ deepest flaw is their economics. They cost too much to build and incur too much financial risk. My writings show why nuclear expansion therefore can’t deliver on its claims: it would reduce and retard climate protection, because it saves between two and 20 times less carbon per dollar, 20 to 40 times slower, than investing in efficiency and micropower. Mr. Lovins said he favored expanding the use of renewables and decentralizing the power grid by developing more local sources of power generation. Meanwhile, Jim Riccio, a Greenpeace spokesman, in a conversation with Green Inc., called Mr. Brand’s arguments “nonsensical, especially concerning the abysmal economics of nuclear power.” Mr. Riccio added: “I don’t question his motives. But you get so desperate to solve climate change you begin clutching at nuclear straws.” Greenpeace argues that energy efficiency will provide the biggest impact in the near term, followed by renewables. It also sees natural gas as a “bridge fuel” to be used while phasing out coal, oil — and nuclear power. Still, the recent Kerry-Boxer climate-change bill recently introduced in the Senate would provide strong support for nuclear power in the nation’s energy mix. And one of the United Nations working groups trying to prepare a global climate deal ahead of the international summit in Copenhagen in December is considering proposals to include nuclear power in the Clean Development Mechanism . The Clean Development Mechanism is an element of the Kyoto protocol that allows developed countries to gain credits against their greenhouse gas reduction commitments by building emission reduction projects in developing countries. Previously, nuclear power projects have not qualified for the program. “I presume that nuclear power will qualify for carbon credits this time, the way it didn’t at Kyoto,” Mr. Brand said. “The salutary French experience with nuclear is geographically and politically close enough to Copenhagen to assure that, I trust.” If this happens, Mr. Brand predicted that many of his critics could become “reluctant tolerators.”",2009-10-23T15:30:18.000+02:00,NYTIMES,science

Since 1954, 408 nuclear power plants worldwide have had more than 4,500 reactor-years of safe operation. NUCLEAR power plants have generally performed safely during the last 34 years, with only one major accident, at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union, and one minor accident, at Three Mile Island in the United States. Since 1954, 408 nuclear power plants worldwide have had more than 4,500 reactor-years of safe operation. Opponents of the Shoreham power plant have created a nuclear phobia, a wall of fear. The proposed New York State-Lilco agreement, if adopted, will lead to the destruction of a vital Long Island power source. As of July 1, 105 United States nuclear power plants were in commercial operation. That includes 6 in New York State. The first American plant, in Pennsylvania, began delivering electrical power in 1955 and was retired in 1982. In the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania in 1979, a loss of reactor coolant resulted in a partial, but completely contained, melting of the nuclear fuel. The two million people living in the area were exposed to radiation of about 1 millirem, an insignificant level. A chest X-ray of less than one second exposes a person to 40 millirems. The maximum dose to any person close to the site was between 40 and 100 millirem. This level is tolerable, because an average person's radiation exposure on Long Island over one year is 150 millirems. No observable effects occur when the radiation level is 25,000 millirems or less. The presidential commission that investigated the Three Mile Island accident concluded that the main health effect was short-term mental stress, including confusion, concern and fear. The commission found no physical harm. Even so, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has enacted many new plant requirements prompting thousands of changes in the nuclear power industry. As of May 5, 303 commercial nuclear power plants were operating outside the United States. In 1954, the first plant started up in the Soviet Union. Since then, a number of technologically advanced nations have generated much of their electrical power from nuclear fuel. France leads, with 70 percent, followed by Belgium, with 66 percent. West Germany and Japan use nuclear plants for 31 percent of their electrical power. Only 18 percent of our power is from nuclear plants. The 1986 accident at Chernobyl was the result of a flawed reactor design and the failure of the plant's operators to abide by safety procedures. The Soviet operators disengaged several safety systems, allowing an uncontrolled power surge, combined with reduced reactor coolant flow. Also, the reactor's control rods responded too slowly to prevent the sudden rise in power. Finally, the reactor was not fully contained, so radioactive materials escaped and fires began. Commercial nuclear plants in the United States have none of the deficiencies that led to the Chernobyl accident, according to the United States Government, the nuclear industry and the insurance companies that underwrite nuclear plant policies. A Soviet academician who led the Soviet delegation at the Vienna conference where the accident was discussed was asked: ''Could Chernobyl happen here?'' He said such an accident was simply not possible in any commercial reactor outside the Soviet Union. The Chernobyl accident caused 31 deaths of workers at the plant, firemen and other rescue personnel. None of the 135,000 Soviet citizens evacuated during the accident have, as of February, shown any symptoms of health problems. All of us take life-threatening risks every day. For example, no mode of transportation is 100 percent safe, yet we travel extensively by car, bus, train and airplane. Though lives are lost each year in travel accidents, we continue to use these forms of transportation because the risk is reasonably small. So it is with nuclear power generation. As noted above, the safety record of operating nuclear power plants is quite good. To minimize risk, the Shoreham plant has many noteworthy safety features, including: * Five physical barriers to contain radioactive materials within the plant during normal operation and even during an accident. * A reactor protector system to immediately and automatically shut the reactor if certain operating conditions exceed safety limits. * Four emergency core cooling systems. * Six emergency diesel generators to shut the plant if all off-site power sources are lost in a hurricane or other catastrophic event. Finally, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has done extensive inspections at Shoreham and has found it to be well constructed and safe. Thus, fear of an accident at the Shoreham site is not well founded. Compared with burning coal, gas or oil for electrical power, nuclear power generation has considerably less environmental impact. The Shoreham plant should be allowed to operate for at least one year to provide the basis to project ratepayer costs. LONG ISLAND OPINION",1988-08-21T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

While the German public has been the most vocal against nuclear power — pushing Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government this week to close temporarily seven of the country’s 17 plants — it is a different story in other parts of Europe. France, the second-largest producer of nuclear power in the world behind the United States, said it would continue to rely on nuclear energy. President Nicolas Sarkozy said Wednesday that the accident in Japan had “provoked across the world a number of questions about the safety of nuclear power stations and the energy mix.” But he added: “France has chosen nuclear energy, which is an essential element of its energy independence and the struggle against greenhouse gases.” He added: “I remain convinced of the relevance today of those choices.” Nonetheless, critics voiced their opposition to the government’s stance. François Mativet, a spokesman for Sortir du Nucléaire, a network of 875 antinuclear groups, described Mr. Sarkozy’s comments as “scandalous” and called for the immediate closing of 16 reactors in France that have been in service for more than 30 years, as well as a longer-term plan to abandon nuclear power. Elsewhere on the Continent, Russia and several Eastern European countries were playing down the risk of nuclear power. So confident was Russia that it signed an agreement with Belarus this week to finance and build Belarus’s first nuclear power plant, a 4.3 billion euro, or $6 billion, project near the Lithuanian border. As if to make a point that Russia had no intention of backing away from its own ambitious nuclear energy policy, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin flew to Minsk for the signing ceremony on Tuesday. “We now have a whole arsenal of progressive technological means to ensure the stable accident-free work of nuclear power stations,” Mr. Putin said. The Belarusian plant will have two reactors. They are expected to begin operating by 2016 and 2018, Prime Minister Mikhail Myasnikovich of Belarus said at the ceremony. Belarus’s neighbors in the European Union — Lithuania, Latvia and Poland — expressed concern about the accord, not only because it would increase Belarus’s dependence on Russia for its energy but also because of safety concerns. The 1986 nuclear accident at Chernobyl, in Ukraine, contaminated parts of these countries, as well as Belarus. Despite such fears, Lithuania and Poland seem determined to go ahead with their own nuclear programs, if they can afford it. The Lithuanian government has said it wants to replace the Ignalina nuclear power plant, which was partly closed in 2004 for safety reasons at the insistence of the European Union, which required it as a condition for joining. Still, Dalia Grybauskaite, Lithuania’s president, said this week that the government might have to rethink its nuclear energy plans, not because of Japan’s disasters but because of costs. “Lithuania should have no illusions that it may be able to build something in the near future; we have no investor,” Mrs. Grybauskaite told The Associated Press. “We have no technologies. It would be very naïve nurturing expectations, especially given the current situation and the economic crisis, which isn’t over yet.” In Poland, which is considering building its own nuclear power plants, Prime Minister Donald Tusk also played down the crisis in Japan. “Plants will be built to provide maximum security,” he told reporters last weekend. A similar attitude can be seen in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania, where public opinion, with few exceptions, has not questioned such a strategy. All those countries intend to build more nuclear plants, despite the costs — and despite the increased dependence on Russia for the construction of these plants or for uranium. In China, the government announced stepped-up inspections at its existing plants in addition to the suspension of new approvals. China, the world’s leader in construction of nuclear plants, plans to add more than 25 reactors, but most are already under construction, and it was unclear how many would be affected by the new order. The announcement came after Premier Wen Jiabao discussed Japan’s nuclear crisis with the State Council, a body roughly equivalent to the White House cabinet. “We must fully grasp the importance and urgency of nuclear safety, and development of nuclear power must make safety the top priority,” the government said on its Web site. “Any hazards must be thoroughly dealt with, and those that do not conform to safety standards must immediately cease construction.” Although the statement said ""all new power plants"" should be suspended until safety standards are revised, an industry expert said Thursday morning that the government intends to continue work on those plants already under construction and halt construction only if it identifies safety problems. In that case, China’s expansion of nuclear power might not slow significantly, he said. Officials have portrayed nuclear energy as a way for China to reduce its reliance on coal and cut its carbon dioxide emissions while at the same time meeting surging demand for electricity. The country has never had a serious nuclear accident, though the speed of its construction program has raised safety concerns. Some specialists also worried that China was building plants too close to urban areas or earthquake fault lines. In late February, just a few weeks before the crisis at Japan’s Daiichi nuclear complex began to unfold, China’s ministry of environmental protection announced regulations prohibiting nuclear construction near earthquake zones or major cities. As recently as Saturday, before the gravity of the nuclear disaster in Japan was clear, a top Chinese official restated China’s commitment to nuclear power. “Some lessons we learn from Japan will be considered in the making of China’s nuclear power plans,” Zhang Lijun, vice minister for environmental protection, said then . “But China will not change its determination and plan for developing nuclear power.” He also said that China used a more modern design than those of Japan’s stricken reactors.",2011-03-16T21:16:20.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-global-business

Uranium mining, conversion, enrichment and transport as well as construction of power stations all create substantial carbon emissions. Even worse, when uranium is fissioned to create power, toxic radioactive waste is produced. Nuclear power is no solution to climate change. Adding enough nuclear power to make a meaningful reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would cost trillions of dollars.

The new group, calling itself the Utiltee, said Thursday that its goal was to encourage a standard of nuclear energy operations that ''goes further than regulatory requirements.'' Three members of the group -James J. O'Connor, chairman of the Commonwealth Edison Company of Chicago; William S. Lee, chairman of the Duke Power Company of Charlotte, N.C., and Sherwood H. Smith, chairman of the Carolina Power and Light Company of Raleigh - said at a news conference that by mid-1987 the nuclear power industry would begin making public its own institutional evaluations of nuclear systems. Mr. O'Connor said this would apply public pressure to nuclear utilities that drained public confidence in energy by ''demonstrating unsatisfactory performance.'' Previously, nuclear power plant performance evaluations made by the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, a nonprofit organization created by the nuclear utility industry after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, have been circulated privately within the power companies surveyed and have been shared with Federal nuclear safety regulators, but without public release.",1986-08-17T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,national-desk-u.s.

The Bush administration's energy task force announces its report today, and President Bush would do well to note the public's concerns about the combination of human fallibility and mechanical failure that can set off catastrophic accidents at nuclear plants and about the link between nuclear waste and nuclear weapons. The nuclear industry's safety and security claims are often misleading. Its spokesmen still insist that the Three Mile Island accident demonstrated that the core of a light water reactor is far more resistant to a meltdown than had been previously thought. They don't acknowledge that the core at the Three Mile Island plant was within hours of an uncontrolled melt -- with Chernobyl-like consequences -- when a new shift supervisor came on duty in a panicked control room and finally figured out that thousands of gallons of cooling water had poured undetected from a valve that was stuck open. Advanced designs for presumably safer light water reactors and simpler pebble-bed reactors still have not made it off the drawing boards. Though the nuclear industry claims it is being crippled by overregulation, its powerful friends on Capitol Hill have threatened budget cuts to make the Nuclear Regulatory Commission compliant. The N.R.C. has begun a process of granting life extension to America's aging supply of 104 power reactors, for example, despite a rash of forced shutdowns due to equipment failures caused by aging. There have been at least eight such shutdowns over the past 16 months, according to an analysis of N.R.C. data by the Union of Concerned Scientists. And the agency has decided not to take enforcement action against weak security at nuclear plants: guards at half the nation's nuclear power plants have failed to repel mock attackers in N.R.C.-supervised exercises that test the protection of reactor safety systems against sabotage. Instead, it is in the process of weakening the rules of the ''game'' used in the mock attacks. A push for nuclear power, which Mr. Bush supports, isn't the way to meet America's urgent energy needs. New plants could not be brought on line quickly enough to offset present electricity shortages, which many experts believe are caused primarily by lack of capacity for transmission, not production. Nor could using nuclear plants make a big dent in global warming. Two-thirds of the emissions of carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, are from transportation or other sources not related to power generation. And worldwide, it would take 3,000 nuclear plants -- a tenfold increase -- to replace all coal plants; yet that increase would reduce carbon emissions by only 20 percent, while enormously expanding risks that materials from nuclear power plants would be applied to making weapons. And since reserves of uranium ore are limited, millions of kilograms of plutonium, equivalent to hundreds of thousands of bombs, would have to be separated from wastes each year to help fuel so many reactors in the future. There are better alternatives. Energy efficiency measures, like using the best available existing technology for air conditioning, lighting and electric motors, could offset the need to build any new nuclear plants. Renewable energy sources and other alternative energy systems, including hydrogen recovered from fossil fuels after removing carbon, could provide new, clean ways to generate power. A rapid expansion of nuclear power would compound the existing dangers of nuclear weapons proliferation. International inspections of nuclear facilities provide uncertain protection; Iran, for example, has pledged to put the reactors it will build under inspection but is still suspected of using civilian nuclear power as a cover for a nascent nuclear weapons program. George Perkovich, in his book ''India's Nuclear Bomb,'' reports that a bomb tested by India in 1998 was made from the grade of plutonium produced in its 10 uninspected power reactors. Is it reasonable to assume that millions of kilograms of plutonium, separated from reactor wastes, can be kept secure, down to amounts of less than eight kilograms, which is all that is needed for an atomic bomb that terrorists and radical states could make? This is the ultimate question requiring an answer before nuclear power is looked to as the solution to climate and energy worries. Paul L. Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, was codirector of the Senate investigation of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident.",2001-05-17T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,opinion

The Soviet authorities have abandoned construction of a nuclear power plant near the Black Sea in the face of public opposition generated by the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl atomic power station, a Soviet newspaper reported today. The newspaper, Komsomolskaya Pravda, also disclosed that all of the 20 operating nuclear power plants in the country and most of those under construction were now ''bitterly opposed'' by local residents. The report on the abandoned project near the city of Krasnodar was the strongest official acknowledgment that since the Chernobyl accident public opinion here had turned sharply against nuclear power and posed a serious threat to the country's ambitious nuclear energy program. Protests Reported Unofficially ''The Krasnodar nuclear power plant is perhaps the first to witness this, but it is not the only one,'' the newspaper said. Public protests against the siting of nuclear power plants have been described in underground publications, but the controversy has only been hinted at in the official press. In late November the head of a Soviet commission investigating the Chernobyl disaster told a Frankfurt environmental magazine that public protests had blocked plans for new nuclear plants near Minsk, the capital of the Byelorussian Republic, and near the Black Sea port of Odessa. If that is so, it has not been officially announced here. The commission official spoke during a visit to West Germany. 'Unprecedented' Action Komsomolskaya Pravda said the abandonment of the Krasnodar project was ''unprecedented'' and had caused nuclear power officials to fear ''a chain reaction'' that would threaten other projects. Since the Chernobyl accident, Soviet officials have repeatedly declared their intention of pushing ahead with a construction program that is meant to double nuclear power output by the year 2000. At that point, according to the official timetable, nuclear power would account for more than 20 percent of the country's electricity. The Komsomolskaya Pravda report said $41 million had already been spent on the new Krasnodar plant before local officials bowed to a flood of letters from local residents and decided at the end of last year to cancel it. The newspaper did not provide the precise location of the plant, the state of construction or details of its planned output and type. The plant is not mentioned in recent Soviet reports, indicating it must be quite new. Like officials in many Soviet localities, the newspaper said, leaders in the Krasnodar region had pleaded with Moscow two years ago for financing to build a nuclear plant to meet an expected shortage of electricity in the northern Caucusus Mountains. ''Before Chernobyl, to have a nuclear power plant was profitable - and also prestigious,'' the newspaper said. ''In addition to providing self-dependency in energy, a nuclear power plant guaranteed increased attention toward the region, including jobs, housing and social and cultural amenities. ''But then the entire world started talking about Chernobyl.'' Thirty-one people died when the No. 4 reactor at Chernobyl exploded and burned as the reactor raged out of control during an experimental shutdown of the cooling system. The explosion rained radioactive particles on surrounding Ukrainian towns and farmland, and contaminated farmlands as far away as Poland and Sweden. The accident forced the evacuation of more than 100,000 residents. Until today's report, the explosion seemed, in the view of Western analysts, to have set back Western nuclear power programs more severely than the Soviet program. 'Situation Is Not Surprising' The shock of Chernobyl brought new determination to anti-nuclear groups in the United States and Europe. ''I think the situation today is not surprising,'' the Komsomolskaya Pravda reporter wrote. ''We have read about the anti-nuclear demonstrations in other countries, and about the referendum in Austria in which it was decided not to build nuclear power plants at all, and about the fears connected with this in the United States.'' The Soviet authorities have worked intensively since the Chernobyl accident to assure the public that nuclear power is safe and that their program would stay on course. The three remaining Chernobyl reactors have been brought back on line, and new safety measures have been adopted at other nuclear power plants, including installation of more safety equipment and intensive training courses for plant employees. Soviet officials have announced that they would not build any more reactors of the type that failed at Chernobyl. The reactor model uses graphite to ''moderate'' or help sustain the fission of its nuclear fuel. Most nuclear power plants in the United States are of a different design in which water moderates the nuclear reaction. Swedes visiting Moscow this week were reportedly told that plans for seven graphite-moderated reactors had been scrapped, including the fifth and sixth reactors for Chernobyl. Komsomolskaya Pravda, the newspaper of the Young Communists' League, argued that critics of nuclear power were misguided. The paper said that the northern Caucasus would face a shortage of eight million kilowatts of electricity by the year 2000, and that building coal-burning power plants instead, as residents propose, would bring pollution to the fertile Kuban Valley.",1988-01-28T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,front-page

The purchase price is about three times the amount analysts estimated in July, because of competition for the unit. Toshiba outbid global giants like Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and General Electric. Nuclear power is increasingly seen as an alternative to energy sources like coal and oil, as energy demand increases around the world. Atsutoshi Nishida, Toshiba's president and chief executive, speaking at a news conference in London, estimated that demand for nuclear power would grow 50 percent by 2020. ''Everywhere you look today you see a rekindling of interest in nuclear power,'' he said, as countries try to combat global warming and diversify their energy sources. The deal on Monday, he said, represented an ''important step for the globalization of the nuclear power business.'' Westinghouse, based in Pittsburgh, has 8,500 employees worldwide and a pretax profit of £18 million ($31.5 million) last year. The company produces pressurized-water nuclear reactors, the most commonly used type, and the fuel for them, and does maintenance and repairs. Westinghouse estimates that half of the world's nuclear plants and 60 percent of those in the United States use its technology. In a sign of the new demand for nuclear power, China alone plans to build more than 25 nuclear power plants by 2020, and the government is said to prefer the pressurized-water reactors that Westinghouse manufactures. Toshiba is already a leading manufacturer of another commonly used type of reactor, which uses boiling water. Toshiba said that it would acquire all of Westinghouse but that it was in discussions to sell minority stakes to other companies, which it did not identify. Toshiba estimates its nuclear business will triple by 2015 because of the deal. The company said it would pay for the purchase over three years, using available cash flow. British Nuclear Fuels, which is owned by the British government, bought Westinghouse in 1999 for $1.1 billion. Lately, British Nuclear has been selling off power-generating assets to concentrate on its nuclear decommissioning and cleanup work in Britain. Britain, the first country to use nuclear energy, is in the process of dismantling plants built in the 1970's whose useful life has ended. Nonetheless, interest in nuclear power is resurgent. ''We got a lot of inquiries from many companies,'' Mike Parker, chief of British Nuclear Fuels, said at the news conference. ''The tide for nuclear has really been rising.''

65c1fc0f-235f-4a43-8e00-9c36d001f71b,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/world/europe/02germany.html,Germans’ Deep Suspicions of Nuclear Power Reach a Political Tipping Point,"BERLIN — Shortly after the earthquake and tsunami struck the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan in March, stores in faraway Germany began selling out of radiation-tracking Geiger counters. Sales of iodine pills to limit the absorption of radiation surged briskly, too, propelled by anxiety that people might find themselves engulfed in clouds of long-range radioactive fallout. No matter that the incipient nuclear catastrophe was about 5,500 miles away, or that Germany, unlike Japan, did not lie on known tectonic fault lines. On the streets of major cities, hundreds of thousands of protesters, casting events in Japan as a portent of what might happen here, turned out ahead of state elections to demand a halt to Germany’s own nuclear power program, the source of nearly a quarter of the nation’s electricity. Those two intertwined phenomena — angst and electoral maneuvering — led to what seemed one of the most abrupt reversals of Angela Merkel’s years as German chancellor: On Monday, she abandoned plans laid only nine months earlier to extend the life of the country’s nuclear power stations and ordered instead that they be phased out by 2022 . The decision meant that, at Europe’s heart, the Continent’s economic powerhouse had committed itself far more radically than its neighbors to the east or west to replace nuclear power with renewable sources of energy like wind turbines — or at least, critics said, with nuclear-generated power imported from neighbors like France. But the German move also raised a question whose answer seemed elusive: What is there in this land of 82 million people that has, over decades, bred an aversion to nuclear energy that seems unrivaled among its economic peers, defying its reputation for reasoned debate? “Just as creationists attempt to ban the theory of evolution from the school books,” said a physicist, Peter Heller, in a Web posting that challenged the national nuclear orthodoxy, “it almost seems as if every factual and neutral explanation in Germany is now in the process of being deleted” from the nuclear debate. Indeed, said Reinhard Wolf, a professor in Frankfurt, the debate is so passionate that “you are either with us or against us.” “There is no middle ground,” Professor Wolf said. The power of antinuclear sentiment has already redrawn the politics of survival for Mrs. Merkel. Recent regional elections in the southern state of Baden-Württemberg and in the northern city-state of Bremen have undermined her conservative Christian Democratic Union to the benefit of the antinuclear Green Party. The Greens’ showing was so strong it seemed that if national elections were held now, they would emerge again as kingmakers, as they were before Mrs. Merkel came to power in 2005. Within days of that fundamental shift, her energy policy, once firmly based on extending the life of Germany’s nuclear plants, swung around in favor of closing the plants much sooner. As she said after the Fukushima crisis began, events in Japan changed “everything in Germany.” When Mrs. Merkel on Monday announced her plans to phase out all of Germany’s 17 nuclear reactors, said Gerd Gigerenzer, director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development here, she courted the danger “that when a government reacts too quickly to an incident like Fukishima, it creates the impression that there is no real reason except winning votes.” “The government has decided to listen to the anxiety of the people and go to the position where the opposition wants them to go,” Mr. Gigerenzer said in a telephone interview. Some call the process Merkelism, defined by the columnist Roland Nelles in the weekly Der Spiegel as politics “based on two principles.”  “The first is that, if the people want it, it must be right,” Mr. Nelles wrote. “The second is that whatever is useful to the people must also be useful to the chancellor.” That calculation seemed borne out by opinion surveys suggesting that around 70 percent of Germans believed that their chancellor was maneuvering for electoral advantage. The same proportion, significantly, said they were prepared to pay higher electricity bills in return for ending nuclear energy. That again seemed to underscore the way the nuclear debate here draws such apocalyptic comparisons. “What Sept. 11, 2001, meant for the vulnerability of the West,” the center-left Süddeutsche Zeitung said, for instance, the catastrophe in Japan on March 11, 2011, “will mean for the idea that nuclear power is controllable. That idea can no longer be supported.” Of course, few modern German reflexes are completely free of what Professor Wolf in Frankfurt called “the German experience” of its Nazi past, which has made many suspicious of the industrialization of destructive forces, whether chemical or nuclear. Some date the roots of Germany’s Greens movement — a leading opponent of nuclear power — even further back, to the romanticism of the 19th century, and the hankering for forests and a wholesome, perfect world. That may seem fanciful to some. But there is little doubt that Germany’s modern history has combined to produce a deep strain of risk aversion, of caution, and a dislike for surprises, all of which magnify the potential hazards of nuclear energy, producing a perception that is different from that of other major European economies like France or Britain, commentators said. “The dramatic events in Japan demonstrate that nuclear power can’t be controlled completely,” said Claudia Roth, a Greens leader. “Nuclear power is not 100 percent safe, which makes it highly dangerous.” Professor Wolf said that German leaders once insisted that “we could trust our engineers, we could trust our technicians, and nuclear power was completely safe.” “This argument has been shattered by Fukushima,” he said. Germany’s suspicion of nuclear technology is not new, developing partly from the profound sense of pacifism that grew from World War II, and from decades of what Professor Wolf called “a potential nuclear battlefield” between East and West on the very front line of the cold war. Four decades ago, civil society groups chose as their slogan “Nuclear power? No thanks!” Then, a groundswell of opposition to America’s stationing of nuclear-armed missiles on German soil seemed to some to conflate two separate issues, nuclear energy and nuclear weapons, making for a combustible mix. Some, though, see the galvanizing moment as the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown in 1986. “That was a shock, and the shock was never overcome,” said Claudia Kemfert, an energy professor at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. “Chernobyl showed that it’s not a safe technology,” Professor Kemfert said in a telephone interview, and that spurred the Social Democrats and the Greens to start campaigns against nuclear technology that not only endured, but broadened. In Germany, Professor Kemfert said, political groups, civil society organizations and faith groups all oppose nuclear power. “These groups all oppose nuclear power,” she said. “This is different in other countries.”",2011-06-02T04:57:39.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-europe

Why focus only on carbon emissions while ignoring iodine-129, plutonium-239, cesium-135 and other lethal radionuclides? The nuclear industry wants us to focus narrowly on the fission process and to ignore the footprint of mining, milling, enrichment, processing and storing of nuclear fuel. It also wants us to ignore the elephant in the room: its inability to rid the planet of high-level nuclear waste that accumulates every hour that any nuclear power plant is operating. The latest plan of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in effect to turn every nuclear power plant in the country into a nuclear waste dump is shocking indeed.

Swedes voted nearly three decades ago to phase out nuclear power, and government officials said Thursday’s announcement marked a significant change. “It’s quite a big step for us,” Ola Altera, state secretary for enterprise and energy, said. “Everyone has moved their preferred positions to reach this compromise,” Mr. Altera added, who noted that his Center Party, had long been skeptical about any nuclear construction in Sweden. Under the Swedish plan, which still needs approval from Parliament, replacement reactors would gradually be built at the 10 sites where reactors are still operating. “There has been pressure from industry to expand the use of nuclear in Sweden, but that’s not the idea,” Mr. Altera said. Other parts of Europe, including Italy and Germany, have also signaled a renewed interest in nuclear as concerns grow over energy security and climate change, and as worries about safety risks diminish. Many restrictions on nuclear power in Europe were imposed after accidents at Three Mile Island in 1979 and at Chernobyl, in the Soviet Union, in 1986. In Britain last year, the government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown took a similar decision to Sweden’s to replace aging nuclear plants, a move that analysts said demonstrated a new era of pragmatism. The Labor government had previously branded nuclear power as an unattractive option. Both Britain and Sweden “have had to face a situation the electricity they generate from existing reactors would be extremely difficult to substitute with anything else but nuclear,” Luis Echávarri, director general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Nuclear Energy Agency, an organizationthat advises industrialized countries, said. Britain generates about 20 percent of its electricity from nuclear, while Sweden still generates about 45 percent of its power from the technology. Using renewable sources to generate those same quantities of power would present huge technical and financial challenges, and might even be impossible, while using coal or less-polluting natural gas would make it much harder for either country to meet its goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Mr. Echávarri said. Sweden already generates about 45 percent of its electricity from hydro power, but public opinion has become more favorable toward nuclear power. Sweden is also aiming by mid-century to have no net emissions of greenhouse gases by using, in part, a combination of low-carbon nuclear power and renewable energies like wind- and hydro power. Even so, Mr. Altera, it could take until 2023 to open the first new reactor in Sweden because of the cost and risks involved. He mentioned the difficulties experienced by Areva, a French nuclear constructor that is building a new reactor at the site at Olkiluoto, Finland, where the project is behind schedule and vastly over budget. The experience “doesn’t make it obvious that there will be new reactors” in Sweden, Mr. Altera said.",2009-02-06T01:34:09.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-world-business

The beleaguered nuclear power industry won a victory in Maine yesterday, where voters rejected an effort to shut down the state's only nuclear power plant. If the referendum had been approved, it would have been the first time voters in any state ordered the shutdown of an operating nuclear power plant. The vote capped a campaign that was closely watched by both supporters and opponents of nuclear power around the country. The Maine referendum was one of those attracting the most attention among dozens of referendums and amendments submitted to voters in various states in elections yesterday. Wagering Plan Wins in Texas In Texas, race track wagering, banned for the last 50 years, will return under a referendum approved by voters there. Supporters had argued that parimutuel gambling would spur the state's sagging economy. But critics, including many church leaders and law-enforcment officials, were opposed. Animal welfare groups joined in the opposition, citing mistreatment of greyhounds at dog tracks in other states. Virginia Lottery Approved Voters in Virginia approved a state lottery, a proposal that had been rejected repeatedly over the last decade by that state's legislature. Many voters told poll takers that they believed the lottery would prevent a tax increase. It was the prospect of greater state revenue that led law-enforcment officials and educators to endorse the measure. Church groups headed the opposition, joined by a number of prominent politicians, including Gov. Gerald L. Baliles and former Gov. Charles S. Robb. The Virginia Legislature has repeatedly rejected a lottery. But Governor Baliles, who did not declare his opposition until a week ago, urged that it be submitted to voters. In other proposals, Mississippi voters agreed to abolish a century-old constitutional prohibition against interracial marriage. In Pennsylvania, a $100 million bond issue was approved to acquire farmland in order to protect it from development. Voters in Baltimore narrowly defeated an amendment to the city charter that would have required the city to provide a residence for all its homeless. Ballot Issue in U.S. Capital In the District of Columbia, voters rejected a proposed bottle bill that would have required deposits on disposable containers. National beverage wholesalers spent nearly $2 million to defeat the measure, making this the most expensive political campaigns in the district's history. Ohio voters rejected a proposal to have the state's 65 top judges appointed by the governor, rather than elected, as is now the case. Ohio labor unions were among the leaders of the drive to preserve the ''sacred right'' of citizens to vote for their judges. In Maine, supporters of the nuclear power plant, led by the consortium of 11 utilities that owns it, spent $5 million to advertise their case that the plant was the cheapest and safest source of power in the state. A shutdown, they argued, would force a 25 percent increase in rates to pay for alternative power. Opponents, with a budget of about $600,000, sought to tap both general fear of nuclear power, heightened by the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union, and specific concern that the continued operation of Maine Yankee might encourage the Federal Government to choose a site in Maine to dispose of high-level radioactive wastes, such as spent fuel from power plants. Even before the balloting, the plant's owners had vowed to fight in court against a shutdown, arguing that the Federal Government, through the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, had sole power to rule on whether nuclear plants are safe to operate. Economics Issue Raised Opponents of the plant said they believed their resolution was worded to withstand such a challenge. It asked voters whether they wanted the plant to continue operating if it produced nuclear waste, which, of course, all nuclear plants do. They argued that waste disposal was an issue of economics, not just plant safety, and that states have jurisdiction over economic issues. When it was commissioned in 1972, the Maine Yankee plant was the largest nuclear power plant in the country, producing 840 megawatts of power. It has since been surpassed in size. But with the cost overruns of more recently built plants, it remains one of the cheapest sources of nuclear or even conventionally produced power, at about 2.5 cents a kilowatt hour wholesale. The plant, which is in Wiscasset, about 40 miles northeast of Portland, is licensed to operate until the year 2008. The referendum in Maine was being closely watched for a reading on sentiment toward nuclear power. The beleaguered nuclear power industry was pressing for a victory as part of its national advertising and public relations campaign to restore nuclear power as a credible energy source. At the same time, critics of nuclear power were looking to the Maine vote as an inspiration to opponents of nuclear power elsewhere in the country. Such critics are pushing referendum's against operating nuclear plants in Massachusetts, California and Oregon. With the help of state and local governments, opponents are also fighting the opening of the completed plants at Seabrook in New Hampshire and Shoreham on Long Island. ''It may spur others on,'' Scott Denman, director of of Safe Energy Communication Council, said of the referendum fight in Maine. The council is an umbrella group of 13 environmental, consumer and safety groups opposed to nuclear power. #2 Earlier Votes in Maine Critics of nuclear power had twice before, in 1980 and 1982, placed a resolution on the Maine ballot seeking the shutdown of Maine Yankee. But the referendums were defeated in both cases.",1987-11-04T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

The recommendations, which have not been made public, will go to a panel of specialists meeting in a closed session in Berlin this weekend. Mrs. Merkel said this week that Germany would certainly end its reliance on nuclear energy, and that the only question was how long nuclear would be needed as a “bridge technology” until other forms of energy could meet the country’s needs. Nuclear energy provides 22.6 percent of Germany’s electricity, according to the Energy Ministry. Coal supplies more than 42 percent; natural gas, 13.6 percent; and renewable sources like wind and solar, 16.5 percent. Other sources provide the rest. Not even Japan, site of the nuclear disaster that followed an earthquake and tsunami in March, plans to abandon nuclear power. Prime Minister Naoto Kan said on Tuesday that Japan would scrap plans to build 14 more nuclear reactors while the government re-evaluated its energy policies. Nuclear energy provides 30 percent of Japan’s electricity. Germany’s move away from nuclear energy is being closely watched by environmental groups and other European governments, particularly those in Central and Eastern Europe that plan to develop or expand nuclear power production. “At the moment, there is really a mixed picture in responding to the Japanese disaster by countries that have nuclear power,” said Serge Gas, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Agency, part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. While Russia, Britain, France and Poland have said they will leave their nuclear energy policies largely unchanged, Italy and Switzerland have stopped development of new reactors. Germany, which has a strong antinuclear movement that cuts across the political spectrum, has gone the furthest in reacting to the Fukushima accident. According to the World Nuclear Association, an industry group, 440 nuclear reactors operate in 31 countries, producing about 15 percent of the world’s electricity. The association said more than 60 plants were being built in 15 countries, notably Russia, China and South Korea. Germany has 17 reactors; six are boiling water reactors, which is the design used at Fukushima, and 11 use pressurized water. The United States has 104 operating reactors, of which 35 are boiling water reactors and 69 are pressurized water. Big German energy companies, including RWE and E.ON, have warned that the rapid withdrawal of nuclear power could spell disaster for the economy, lead to electricity shortages and turn the country into a net importer of energy. But the so-called Ethics Commission appointed by Mrs. Merkel said that rather than being damaged by the abandonment of nuclear power, the German economy could benefit from the reduction of energy use and the development of alternative power sources. The commission is led by a conservative, Klaus Töpfer, a former environment minister and former executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, and Matthias Kleiner, president of the German Research Foundation. The 22 panel members were drawn from the energy industry and nongovernmental organizations. “A withdrawal from nuclear power will spur growth, offer enormous technical, economic and social opportunities to position Germany even further as an exporter of sustainable products and services,” said the panel’s 28-page report, which was seen by The International Herald Tribune. “Germany could show that a withdrawal from nuclear energy is the chance to create a high-powered economy.” But while citing the economic benefits of a withdrawal from nuclear power, the commission emphasized that Germany’s 17 nuclear plants should be closed for safety reasons. “The withdrawal is necessary to fundamentally eliminate risks,” it said. The commission also said it would be unacceptable for Germany to ration electricity, import power from nuclear plants in other countries or increase carbon dioxide emissions. “There is an ethical responsibility to combat climate change,” it said. The commission acknowledged that it was not possible to greatly accelerate the development of renewable energy. Instead, it recommended measures, including reducing energy use by as much as 60 percent and developing cleaner technologies for coal-fired power plants. Only last year, Mrs. Merkel overturned a decision by a previous Social Democratic-Green government to close Germany’s nuclear plants by 2022, instead allowing the newer reactors to operate well into the 2030s. She quickly changed her mind in March, as the damage to the Fukushima Daiichi plant became apparent. She ordered seven of Germany’s power plants to be temporarily closed, instituted a moratorium on construction of new reactors, ordered an intensive review of security and safety measures, and appointed the Ethics Commission. She announced the decision days before regional elections in southwestern Germany, where the Greens soundly defeated the governing conservatives.",2011-05-11T20:51:27.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-
290df74a-54ed-40fd-9b6b-fe96bfc6db9b,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/world/asia/japan-pushes-to-revive-moribund-nuclear-energy-sector.html,"Reversing Course, Japan Makes Push to Restart Dormant Nuclear Plants","TOKYO — The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made its biggest push yet to revive Japan’s nuclear energy program on Tuesday, announcing details of a draft plan that designates atomic power as an important long-term electricity source. The new Basic Energy Plan, which states that Japan will push to restart reactors that were closed after the disaster in 2011 at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, overturns a promise made by a previous government to phase out the country’s nuclear reactors. The plan also leaves open the possibility of building new plants as well as restarting existing ones. Japan’s minister for trade and industry, Toshimitsu Motegi, sought to play down the shift, telling reporters that Japan was still committed to “reducing its reliance on nuclear power.” But he also criticized the earlier commitment, first made by Prime Minister Naoto Kan in the months after the Fukushima disaster, to forgo nuclear power entirely, a policy Mr. Motegi called irresponsible for a resource-poor nation. Still, the government’s own energy plan was vague, setting no specific targets for the percentage of power to be provided by nuclear energy. Mr. Motegi said the country needed more time to figure out the best mix of energy sources, which would also include renewables like solar, wind and geothermal power. The Japanese have been struggling for three years to decide whether to return to nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster, which contaminated a vast area of northeast Japan and is still keeping tens of thousands of people from their homes as a cleanup effort continues. Mr. Abe has been promising to add nuclear power back into Japan’s energy mix since soon after he took office in late 2012, but he has been unable to budge national opinion even as a renewed reliance on fossil fuels has increased energy costs and helped drive Japan’s trade deficit to record highs. Polls show lingering public misgivings about the safety of nuclear energy and the government’s ability to oversee it, with a majority of people supporting a gradual phaseout. The draft plan issued this week, the first under Mr. Abe, suggests that he plans to move forward despite a lack of agreement among citizens. To ease public jitters, an independent regulatory agency has been evaluating whether Japan’s 50 operable reactors, which are all currently idle, can safely be brought back online. Even with regulatory approval, though, local opposition could still block or delay restarts. The national plan did not say when the government would begin trying to restart reactors, which are being upgraded to meet the agency’s new safety requirements. The government is set to discuss the policy with opposition parties, but the cabinet can approve it at any time. Mr. Abe may feel empowered to move ahead in part because the country’s organized opposition to nuclear power — which erupted in the months after the Fukushima accident into mass street rallies — has failed to materialize. In a closely watched governor’s race in Tokyo this month, a fractured field of antinuclear candidates appeared to split the opposition vote, helping to return a pro-nuclear governing party candidate to office. That victory has given momentum to Mr. Abe’s push. Mr. Kan, the former prime minister who led the country’s response to the Fukushima crisis, blasted the turn back toward nuclear power. “This government has not learned the lessons of Fukushima,” he said in a telephone interview. “Japan was on the brink, but now we want to go back to nuclear for economic reasons. But what happens to the economy if another disaster hits?” Fears about nuclear safety were heightened on Tuesday by another mishap at the crippled Fukushima plant, where continued radiation leaks and errors have undermined cleanup efforts. The plant’s operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, said a damaged power cable had shut down a vital cooling system, forcing workers to suspend the delicate process of removing spent nuclear fuel rods from a wrecked storage pool. The cooling system for the pool at Reactor No. 4 failed for about four hours on Tuesday before power was restored, Tokyo Electric Power said in an emailed announcement. It added that the pool temperature was stable and that it had not detected a rise in radiation levels at the plant. The country’s new energy plan calls nuclear power an important “baseload” electricity source — one that can produce energy at a constant rate and at a lower cost than alternatives like solar or wind power. Proponents of renewable energy argue that safety risks and the costs of handling nuclear waste make nuclear power less reliable and more expensive than other options. The plan also says that Japan will ultimately determine the appropriate size of its nuclear program after taking into account its future energy needs, as well as its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which have surged with the decline of nuclear power. That wording, Japanese news outlets noted, left the door open for the government to build new plants.",2014-02-25T11:47:18.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Approves British Plan for Nuclear Power Plant,"LONDON — The European authorities on Wednesday approved construction of Britain’s first nuclear power station since the mid-1990s, in a ruling that could clear the way for other European countries to plan nuclear plants as part of their energy future. The decision, by the European Union’s competition regulator, removes one of the final obstacles for the plant, at Hinkley Point in southwest England, which would produce about 7 percent of Britain’s current power supply but would not start operating before 2023. Although the British government had already approved the power station, Brussels needed to sign off to make sure the financing plan did not constitute unfair state aid. The plant would be built by EDF Energy, the British subsidiary of the French state-controlled utility, which already operates nearly all the nuclear power plants in Britain. EDF said the plants would cost 16 billion pounds, or $25.7 billion, at 2012 prices. EDF has spent more than 1 billion pounds on design work and preparation for the site, which overlooks the Severn Estuary. Under the arrangement, government-guaranteed rates for the power eventually generated from the plant is guaranteed to give EDF a return on its investment. Policy makers and energy executives elsewhere are closely watching Hinkley Point as a test case of whether new nuclear plants can be built in the West given the high costs and the environmental risks. While valued by proponents as a cleaner-energy alternative to carbon-fueled power plants, the radioactive risks of nuclear power were vividly illustrated by the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011, an event that helped prompt Germany’s decision to abandon all future plans for nuclear power stations. The Hinkley Point project is running years behind schedule, with mounting costs. Centrica, a British utility, walked away last year from its 20 percent share in the project, citing frustration over delays and costs. To share in the costs, EDF has said it wants to bring in two Chinese state-backed companies, the China General Nuclear Corporation and the China National Nuclear Corporation, and, potentially, other investors. The British government is nonetheless pressing on with the project, as it worries about future sources of energy. Britain’s current nuclear plants, which generate around 20 percent of the country’s electricity, are approaching the ends of their lives. Meanwhile, the country’s North Sea oil and natural gas reserves are dwindling, and coal-fired plants are being retired to reduce carbon emissions. Britain’s determination to go ahead with a new nuclear power station at a large cost accentuates the divisions that are opening among European countries over nuclear power. The government wants to build not only Hinkley Point but also several more plants to replace its aging collection of nuclear reactors. Meanwhile, Germany is easing out of the nuclear power business, forcing utilities to rely more on highly polluting coal to generate the kind of steady flows of electricity that cannot yet be supplied by renewable energy sources like solar and wind. Despite the problems, other nuclear providers from around the world are eyeing Britain as a potential market. Toshiba and Hitachi of Japan have been studying British projects, while EDF is also contemplating building another plant on Britain’s east coast at Sizewell. But how many new plants will be built in Britain or other European countries now considering such a move — including Hungary, Lithuania and Poland — remains a big question. A few countries voted against the decision. That includes Austria, which opposes the use of nuclear power and is threatening to go to court to try to block Hinkley Point. Of the main European economies, only France has long remained committed to nuclear power. ""You will have a lot of discussion about how expensive these projects are,” said Roland Vetter, an analyst at CF Partners, an energy trading firm in London. “I don’t know how many more companies will want to build more nuclear plants in Britain.” The specter of future power outages and the pressures to meet climate change goals have pushed the British government to intervene once again in a power sector that was privatized decades ago. The government, which also built all of Britain’s nuclear plants in the past, is now getting actively involved in the energy business, offering generous subsidies not only for nuclear power but also for renewable energy installations like giant offshore wind farms and even projects using tidal power. Joaquín Almunia, the European official in charge of competition policy, who announced Wednesday’s decision, had been investigating since last year whether Hinkley Point violated European Union rules against state aid. Those subsidies would take two main forms. The government had proposed a guaranteed wholesale price of 92.50 pounds a megawatt hour for the electricity the new plant will generate. That is about double current electricity rates in Britain. In a second form of subsidy, the British government also agreed to provide financial guarantees for the projects estimated at 17 billion pounds in financing. Brussels’ state-aid concern would focus on whether Britain was giving unfair advantages to EDF over other industry players — or whether the government subsidies would distort energy markets.But Mr. Alumunia said his office had been persuaded by Britain’s argument that the Hinkley project could not proceed without the government’s subsidies and so had agreed not to oppose it after London agreed to some modest changes. Analysts say that there was tremendous pressure on the European regulators to approve the deal because two big players in the 28 nation group, Britain and France, were behind it and because the British government portrayed the power station as necessary to keep the lights on — not to mention creating around 25,000 jobs during the decade-long construction phase. “This is an important next step on the road to Britain’s first new nuclear power station in a generation,” Ed Davey, Britain’s energy and climate change minister, said in a statement on Wednesday. Although Mr. Almunia said that the Hinkley Point approval did not necessarily create a precedent, analysts say the go-ahead given to the project should encourage other operators interested in building new nuclear facilities in Britain as well as in other European countries to think that they, too, might be able to use government financial support. “Any other countries in the E.U. that want nuclear power will take heart from this decision,” said Antony Froggatt, a nuclear analyst at Chatham House, a London-based research organization. Mark Johnston, a senior adviser to the European Policy Center, a research organization in Brussels, said the opposition to the Hinkley Point decision by a number of countries, which appeared to include Austria, Denmark, Slovenia and Luxembourg, showed that skepticism about the project had different strands. “Austria is against nuclear power, full stop,” said Mr. Johnston. “But some of the others don’t like the idea that market disciplines are broken to fund nuclear construction, while others may worry that fewer emissions in Britain will just make coal cheaper for other parts of Europe like Poland, and do little to reduce greenhouse gases overall.”",2014-10-08T16:52:42.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-international-business

RWE and E.On said they would not proceed with a £15 billion ($24 billion) joint venture called Horizon Nuclear Power to build nuclear power plants in Britain. The companies said that the economic crisis reduced the capital available for major projects and that Germany’s plan to phase out nuclear power had put additional financial pressure on the companies. The decision to pull out of Horizon, based in Gloucester, followed a strategic review, said the companies, which are now focusing on finding a new owner for Horizon. “For the right company Horizon remains an attractive project, but sadly, at this time, not for us,” Tony Cocker, chief executive of E.On UK, said in a statement. The British government had drawn up concrete plans for as many as 12 nuclear reactors at eight sites in an effort to guarantee the supply of electricity as it moves to comply with European Union emissions standards. Under European Union law, about 30 percent of the coal and oil-fired power plants in Britain need to close by 2015 and would have to be replaced. Horizon was on track to open its first nuclear station by 2020. Charles Hendry, Britain’s energy minister, said the withdrawal by the two German companies was “clearly very disappointing, but the partners have clearly explained that this decision was based on pressures elsewhere in their businesses and not on any doubts about the role of nuclear in U.K. energy future.” But finding a buyer for Horizon, which was set up in 2009, could be a challenge. Nuclear power projects have a longer planning and investment horizon than other energy projects. E.On said abandoning Horizon would allow it to focus its investments in Britain on projects that could deliver earlier benefits, “rather than the very long term and large investment new nuclear power calls for.” Smaller rivals may struggle to come up with the financing for such projects. Scottish and Southern Energy, the utility, pulled out of a nuclear power project in Britain last year, citing construction risks. What is more, other large energy companies, including the French utility EDF, already have their own nuclear projects in Britain. EDF has yet to make its final decision on its plan to build a new reactor in the southwest of Britain. The company’s decision could hinge on the outcome of the French presidential election in May. Antony Froggatt, a senior research fellow at Chatham House in London, said the decision by the German utilities would at the very least “delay the government’s plans to pursue the construction of new nuclear plants but more likely it will result in a reduction of capacity.” Nuclear power currently provides about 15 percent of Britain’s electricity, he said. The Labour Party, in the opposition, said RWE and E.On’s decision not to proceed with the Horizon project was “disappointing.” “Nuclear power has a vital role to play as part of a more sustainable, balanced and low-carbon future energy mix, to make us less reliant on volatile fossil fuel prices, increase our energy security, and keep prices down for families,” said Caroline Flint, a Labour lawmaker with responsibility for the party’s energy policy. E.On, the largest German utility, said its profit fell 50 percent last year, partly because it had to close nuclear reactors. The disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan a year ago prompted Germany to order the closing of all nuclear plants in the country by 2022. Volker Beckers, chief executive of Npower, RWE’s British operation, said he was convinced that Horizon’s development projects represented excellent sites for new nuclear power stations and that “nuclear power has an important role to play in the U.K.’s future energy mix.”",2012-03-29T22:19:38.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-global-business

President Emmanuel Macron announced a major buildup of France’s huge nuclear power program on Thursday, pledging to construct up to 14 new-generation reactors and a fleet of smaller nuclear plants as the country seeks to slash planet-warming emissions and cut its reliance on foreign energy. The announcement represented an about-face for Mr. Macron, who had previously pledged to reduce France’s reliance on nuclear power but has pivoted to burnishing an image as a pronuclear president battling climate change as he faces a tough re-election bid in April. “What our country needs is the rebirth of France’s nuclear industry,” Mr. Macron said at a nuclear turbine factory in the industrial city of Belfort in eastern France as throngs of workers and political officials gathered around. “The time has come for a nuclear renaissance,” he added. Mr. Macron’s move is seen as a pivotal moment in a growing debate over nuclear power in Europe. The divide has taken on new dimensions as leaders pledge to avert a climate catastrophe and grapple with an energy crisis that has sent prices for natural gas and electricity surging to record highs — in part because nuclear energy production has fallen. Mr. Macron has been leading a coalition of like-minded countries in backing nuclear energy to speed up the push to net-zero emissions and energy independence. That has opened a rift with a group of nations led by Germany, which is wary of nuclear proliferation and will close its last atomic power plants this year, following a 2011 policy set by former Chancellor Angela Merkel after the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan. The French plan is aimed at cementing the country’s position as Europe’s biggest atomic power producer and positioning Électricité de France, or EDF, the troubled state-backed operator, to compete more aggressively against Chinese and American companies in the growing global market for nuclear energy. With an estimated starting price of 50 billion euros ($57 billion), Mr. Macron’s blueprint consists of constructing six mammoth next-generation pressurized water reactors at existing nuclear sites around France starting in 2028, with an option to consider building up to eight more by 2050. Saying it had “fallen behind” in the nuclear energy race, Mr. Macron said France would also build a prototype small modular reactor — a new type of scaled-down nuclear power plant — by 2030, pitting the country against a growing number of others pushing out the technology. Environmental groups denounced the plan, saying that Mr. Macron had not consulted Parliament or French citizens, and that nuclear power, which doesn’t produce direct carbon emissions but generates long-term radioactive waste, was a nonstarter in the fight against climate change. “This is a crucial decision that would engage France for centuries in terms of the hazardous waste that nuclear facilities produce,” Nicolas Nace, the head of energy transition policy at Greenpeace France, said. “There has been no real democratic debate about this — just a candidate making opportunistic declarations,” he added. Climate change and the nuclear industry’s potential role in it have become a central issue in France’s coming presidential election. Most candidates, with the exception of France’s Greens party, have said nuclear power is needed to meet climate goals. The nuclear industry is a national priority in France, creating about 200,000 jobs directly and indirectly. France relies on an aging fleet of 56 nuclear reactors — the most after the United States, with 93 — to generate 70 percent of its electricity and to export energy to other countries. But France has fallen from dominance as EDF, which has grappled with a series of longstanding setbacks, faces a full-blown crisis just as Europe struggles with an energy crunch. The company warned this week that its nuclear energy output would slump to the lowest levels since the 1990s because of problems at some sites, sending European energy prices to fresh highs. The company has temporarily closed 10 reactors, down from 17 in December, for maintenance, including to fix cracks found in pipes at some plants. The energy shortfall has left France in the awkward position this winter of leaning more heavily on its coal-fired power stations, tapping coal-generated electricity from Germany and relying on natural gas imports as prices spike amid the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. While Mr. Macron has sought to position himself as a European leader in transitioning to a carbon-free future, France’s wind and solar power capacity is not yet sufficient to make up for the shortfall in its nuclear energy output. On Thursday, Mr. Macron said France would ramp up those power sources by seeking to create at least 50 offshore wind farms and doubling France’s capacity of onshore wind power. France will also increase its solar power capacity tenfold, to generate over 100 gigawatts of power, by 2030, he said. “We need to massively develop renewable energies,” Mr. Macron said, “because it is the only way to meet our immediate electricity needs, since it takes 15 years to build a nuclear reactor.” Whether EDF can fulfill Mr. Macron’s orders remains to be seen. The debt-laden company has been grappling with corrosion problems at old nuclear reactors for years. It has also struggled to convince foreign buyers that it can deliver projects on time and within budget. The company’s pressurized reactors — the type that Mr. Macron called for in his speech — have faced severe delays and cost overruns. In France, a reactor in the northwestern town of Flamanville that was supposed to be completed in 2012 at a cost of €3 billion has faced setbacks and won’t open until at least 2023, with the bill ballooning to over €12 billion. Another EDF reactor, in Finland, was planned to open in 2009; it now won’t start full power production until June. The EDF-backed Taishan Nuclear Power Plant in China’s Guangdong Province faced what the company said were “performance issues” last year. Mr. Macron said the government would “assume its responsibilities” in securing EDF’s finances and its short- and medium-term financing capacity. France will provide the company with what is likely to be tens of billions in state aid — made possible in part after Mr. Macron lobbied Brussels to classify nuclear energy as a green investment. Mr. Macron’s decision to cast the renewal of France’s nuclear energy arsenal around the fight against climate change at the Belfort nuclear turbine factory was strategic.

I recently retired from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. During my 25 years there, I worked as a nuclear-power-plant inspector at many sites in the United States, including two years as a resident inspector at the now defunct Shoreham nuclear-power plant. At Shoreham, I witnessed firsthand how political considerations and public opposition by a vocal minority led to the decision to abandon an otherwise technically sound and safe source of electrical power. So it was a refreshing change to see a comprehensive, well-balanced and technically accurate discussion of the issues associated with nuclear power. Charles D. Petrone Rockville Centre, N.Y. If nuclear power ''makes economic sense,'' so did coal and oil -- until we began to face the catastrophic cost of global warming. Nuclear power may make economic sense to economists, who don't count the cost of accident, waste and weapons proliferation. If so, why not repeal the recently renewed Price-Anderson Act, which shields the nuclear industry from full liability? David Keppel Bloomington, Ind.",2006-07-30T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,magazine

It is a first-rate piece of television journalism. NUCLEAR energy has fallen short in the United States; the promise of clean, cheap power has not been met. France, however, has had a success story. ''Nuclear Power: In France It Works,'' an ''NBC News Special'' at 10 o'clock tonight, judiciously examines what happened. It is a first-rate piece of television journalism. The program, produced by Reuven Frank, is not advocating nuclear energy; it is not taking a stand one way or the other. It wants us to consider: How has French nuclear power managed to produce the cheapest electricity in Europe, generating enough surplus to export $1 billion worth of electricity each year? In the United States, uncompleted nuclear plants lie rusting. France has 49 nuclear reactors in operation; 15 are under construction. France brings a new plant on line in six years - from the start of construction through operation - at a cost of $1 billion. The plants are run by the Government, and they are all uniformly designed. By contrast, some United States plants have taken 12 years to go on line, at costs up to $4 billion. These plants, as the NBC correspondent Steve Delaney says, are ''virtually custom built to different designs by different contractors.'' Even so, the questions this raises may now all be moot. No new nuclear plant has been ordered in the United States since the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island. The program doesn't quite say so, but nuclear energy in the United States is almost a dead issue. * In France, however, it is a national cause. The political left and right are united. Extraneous matters do not intrude. In a recent newspaper interview, the head of the French nuclear monopoly, Rene Carle, said that ''any three people can get together to stop a nuclear plant'' in the United States. France is different. ''There is a unique national consensus here,'' Mr. Delaney reports. ''The French believe their survival depends on nuclear power. That's why in France it works.'' Presumably, this is true. Coal mines in France are exhausted. The country is dependent on OPEC for oil. ''Only in France,'' Mr. Delaney reports, ''did Chernobyl fail to ignite public outrage. There is no anti-nuclear party here and the issue no longer sparks political debate.'' At the same time, the possibilities of debate are deflected. The French Government maintains a continuing public-relations campaign. NBC shows citizens in hard hats being led on tours of nuclear plants. In French schools, students study nuclear energy. The prestigious Ecole Polytechnique, founded by Napoleon - ''part West Point, part M.I.T.,'' Mr. Delaney calls it - trains technicians to run the nuclear plants. Visually, some of the NBC report is static; it looks like an industrial promotion film. Given the subject, though, it's hard to imagine how it could look otherwise. Nuclear energy is a sober topic, often contentious, and it suffers from a bad press. ''Nuclear Power: In France It Works'' - written by Mr. Delaney and directed by Peter Poor - is almost a corrective. It is a very balanced look. Thus, while chronicling a success story, it also worries about nuclear garbage. Waste material with low levels of radiation may be safely buried and forgotten. High-level waste cannot be forgotten; it may stay radioactive for 5,000 years. For this and other reasons, NBC says, France's West German neighbors worry. Nonetheless, France persists. The results are impressive; 76 percent of French electricity is now generated by nuclear power - the United States's figure is 16 percent - and France exports its technology to the world. There are reasons for this, and ''Nuclear Power: In France It Works'' explains them. It is a solid piece of work.",1987-03-11T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,arts
20500286-ec7b-42d3-9bf5-6777b724a4ca,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/world/asia/27collusion.html,Culture of Complicity Tied To Stricken Nuclear Plant,"TOKYO — Given the fierce insularity of Japan’s nuclear industry, it was perhaps fitting that an outsider exposed the most serious safety cover-up in the history of Japanese nuclear power. It took place at Fukushima Daiichi, the plant that Japan has been struggling to get under control since last month’s earthquake and tsunami. In 2000, Kei Sugaoka, a Japanese-American nuclear inspector who had done work for General Electric at Daiichi, told Japan’s main nuclear regulator about a cracked steam dryer that he believed was being concealed. If exposed, the revelations could have forced the operator, Tokyo Electric Power, to do what utilities least want to do: undertake costly repairs. What happened next was an example, critics have since said, of the collusive ties that bind the nation’s nuclear power companies, regulators and politicians. Despite a new law shielding whistle-blowers, the regulator, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, divulged Mr. Sugaoka’s identity to Tokyo Electric, effectively blackballing him from the industry. Instead of immediately deploying its own investigators to Daiichi, the agency instructed the company to inspect its own reactors. Regulators allowed the company to keep operating its reactors for the next two years even though, an investigation ultimately revealed, its executives had actually hidden other, far more serious problems, including cracks in the shrouds that cover reactor cores. Investigators may take months or years to decide to what extent safety problems or weak regulation contributed to the disaster at Daiichi, the worst of its kind since Chernobyl. But as troubles at the plant and fears over radiation continue to rattle the nation, the Japanese are increasingly raising the possibility that a culture of complicity made the plant especially vulnerable to the natural disaster that struck the country on March 11. Already, many Japanese and Western experts argue that inconsistent, nonexistent or unenforced regulations played a role in the accident — especially the low seawalls that failed to protect the plant against the tsunami and the decision to place backup diesel generators that power the reactors’ cooling system at ground level, which made them highly susceptible to flooding. A 10-year extension for the oldest of Daiichi’s reactors suggests that the regulatory system was allowed to remain lax by politicians, bureaucrats and industry executives single-mindedly focused on expanding nuclear power. Regulators approved the extension beyond the reactor’s 40-year statutory limit just weeks before the tsunami despite warnings about its safety and subsequent admissions by Tokyo Electric, often called Tepco, that it had failed to carry out proper inspections of critical equipment. The mild punishment meted out for past safety infractions has reinforced the belief that nuclear power’s main players are more interested in protecting their interests than increasing safety. In 2002, after Tepco’s cover-ups finally became public, its chairman and president resigned, only to be given advisory posts at the company. Other executives were demoted, but later took jobs at companies that do business with Tepco. Still others received tiny pay cuts for their role in the cover-up. And after a temporary shutdown and repairs at Daiichi, Tepco resumed operating the plant. In a telephone interview from his home in the San Francisco Bay Area, Mr. Sugaoka said, “I support nuclear power, but I want to see complete transparency.” Revolving Door In Japan, the web of connections between the nuclear industry and government officials is now popularly referred to as the “nuclear power village.” The expression connotes the nontransparent, collusive interests that underlie the establishment’s push to increase nuclear power despite the discovery of active fault lines under plants, new projections about the size of tsunamis and a long history of cover-ups of safety problems. Just as in any Japanese village, the like-minded — nuclear industry officials, bureaucrats, politicians and scientists — have prospered by rewarding one another with construction projects, lucrative positions, and political, financial and regulatory support. The few openly skeptical of nuclear power’s safety become village outcasts, losing out on promotions and backing. Until recently, it had been considered political suicide to even discuss the need to reform an industry that appeared less concerned with safety than maximizing profits, said Kusuo Oshima, one of the few governing Democratic Party lawmakers who have long been critical of the nuclear industry. “Everyone considered that a taboo, so nobody wanted to touch it,” said Mr. Oshima, adding that he could speak freely because he was backed not by a nuclear-affiliated group, but by Rissho Kosei-Kai, one of Japan’s largest lay Buddhist movements. “It’s all about money,” he added. At Fukushima Daiichi and elsewhere, critics say that safety problems have stemmed from a common source: a watchdog that is a member of the nuclear power village. Though it is charged with oversight, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency is part of the Ministry of Trade, Economy and Industry, the bureaucracy charged with promoting the use of nuclear power. Over a long career, officials are often transferred repeatedly between oversight and promotion divisions, blurring the lines between supporting and policing the industry. Influential bureaucrats tend to side with the nuclear industry — and the promotion of it — because of a practice known as amakudari, or descent from heaven. Widely practiced in Japan’s main industries, amakudari allows senior bureaucrats, usually in their 50s, to land cushy jobs at the companies they once oversaw. According to data compiled by the Communist Party, one of the fiercest critics of the nuclear industry, generations of high-ranking officials from the ministry have landed senior positions at the country’s 10 utilities since Japan’s first nuclear plants were designed in the 1960s. In a pattern reflective of the clear hierarchy in Japan’s ministries and utilities, the ministry’s most senior officials went to work at Tepco, while those of lower ranks ended up at smaller utilities. At Tepco, from 1959 to 2010, four former top-ranking ministry officials successively served as vice presidents at the company. When one retired from Tepco, his junior from the ministry took over what is known as the ministry’s “reserved seat” of vice president at the company. In the most recent case, a director general of the ministry’s Natural Resources and Energy Agency, Toru Ishida, left the ministry last year and joined Tepco early this year as an adviser. Prime Minister Naoto Kan’s government initially defended the appointment but reversed itself after the Communist Party publicized the extent of amakudari appointments since the 1960s. Mr. Ishida, who would have normally become vice president later this year, was forced to step down last week. Kazuhiro Hasegawa, a spokesman for Tepco, denied that it was an amakudari appointment, adding that the company simply hired the best people. The company declined to make an executive available for an interview about the company’s links with bureaucrats and politicians. Lower-ranking officials also end up at similar, though less lucrative, jobs at the countless companies affiliated with the power companies, as well as advisory bodies with close links to the ministry and utilities. “Because of this collusion, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency ends up becoming a member of the community seeking profits from nuclear power,” said Hidekatsu Yoshii, a Communist Party lawmaker and nuclear engineer who has long followed the nuclear industry. Collusion flows the other way, too, in a lesser-known practice known as amaagari, or ascent to heaven. Because the regulatory panels meant to backstop the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency lack full-time technical experts, they depend largely on retired or active engineers from nuclear-industry-related companies. They are unlikely to criticize the companies that employ them. Even academics who challenge the industry may find themselves shunned. As Japan has begun looking into the problems surrounding collusion since March 11, the Japanese news media has highlighted the discrimination faced by academics who raised questions about the safety of nuclear power. In Japan, research into nuclear power is financed by the government or nuclear power-related companies. Unable to conduct research, skeptics, especially a group of six at Kyoto University, languished for decades as assistant professors. One, Hiroaki Koide, a nuclear reactor expert who has held a position equivalent to assistant professor for 37 years at Kyoto University, said he applied unsuccessfully for research funds when he was younger. “They’re not handed out to outsiders like me,” he said. In the United States, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the main regulatory agency for the nuclear power industry, can choose from a pool of engineers unaffiliated with a utility or manufacturer, including those who learned their trade in the Navy or at research institutes like Brookhaven or Oak Ridge. As a result, the N.R.C. does not rely on the industry itself to develop proposals and rules. In Japan, however, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency lacks the technical firepower to draw up comprehensive regulations and tends to turn to industry experts to provide that expertise. The agency “has the legal authority to regulate the utilities, but significantly lacks the technical capability to independently evaluate what they propose,” said Satoshi Sato, who has nearly 30 years’ experience working in the nuclear industry in the United States and Japan. “Naturally, the regulators tend to avoid any risk by proposing their own ideas.” Inspections are not rigorous, Mr. Sato said, because agency inspectors are not trained thoroughly, and safety standards are watered down to meet levels that the utilities can financially bear, he and others said. Dominion in Parliament The political establishment, one of the great beneficiaries of the nuclear power industry, has shown little interest in bolstering safety. In fact, critics say, lax oversight serves their interests. Costly renovations get in the way of building new plants, which create construction projects, jobs and generous subsidies to host communities. The Liberal Democrats, who governed Japan nearly without interruption from 1955 to 2009, have close ties to the management of nuclear-industry-related companies. The Democratic Party, which has governed since, is backed by labor unions, which, in Japan, tend to be close to management. “Both parties are captive to the power companies, and they follow what the power companies want to do,” said Taro Kono, a Liberal Democratic lawmaker with a reputation as a reformer. Under Japan’s electoral system, in which a significant percentage of legislators is chosen indirectly, parties reward institutional backers with seats in Parliament. In 1998, the Liberal Democrats selected Tokio Kano, a former vice president at Tepco, for one of these seats. Backed by Keidanren — Japan’s biggest business lobby, of which Tepco is one of the biggest members — Mr. Kano served two six-year terms in the upper house of Parliament until 2010. In a move that has raised eyebrows even in a world of cross-fertilizing interests, he has returned to Tepco as an adviser. While in office, Mr. Kano led a campaign to reshape the country’s energy policy by putting nuclear power at its center. He held leadership positions on energy committees that recommended policies long sought by the nuclear industry, like the use of a fuel called mixed oxide, or mox, in fast-breeder reactors. He also opposed the deregulation of the power industry. In 1999, Mr. Kano even complained in Parliament that nuclear power was portrayed unfairly in government-endorsed school textbooks. “Everything written about solar energy is positive, but only negative things are written about nuclear power,” he said, according to parliamentary records. Most important, in 2003, on the strength of Mr. Kano’s leadership, Japan adopted a national basic energy plan calling for the growth of nuclear energy as a way to achieve greater energy independence and to reduce Japan’s emission of greenhouses gases. The plan and subsequent versions mentioned only in broad terms the importance of safety at the nation’s nuclear plants despite the 2002 disclosure of cover-ups at Fukushima Daiichi and a 1999 accident at a plant northeast of Tokyo in which high levels of radiation were spewed into the air. Mr. Kano’s legislative activities drew criticism even from some members of his own party. “He rewrote everything in favor of the power companies,” Mr. Kono said. In an interview at a Tepco office here, accompanied by a company spokesman, Mr. Kano said he had served in Parliament out of “conviction.” “It’s disgusting to be thought of as a politician who was a company errand boy just because I was supported by a power company and the business community,” Mr. Kano said. Taking on a Leviathan So entrenched is the nuclear power village that it easily survived postwar Japan’s biggest political shake-up. When the Democratic Party came to power 20 months ago, it pledged to reform the nuclear industry and strengthen the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. Hearings on reforming the agency were held starting in 2009 at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, said Yosuke Kondo, a lawmaker of the governing Democratic Party who was the ministry’s deputy minister at the time. But they fizzled out, he said, after a new minister was appointed in September 2010. The new minister, Akihiro Ohata, was a former engineer at Hitachi’s nuclear division and one of the most influential advocates of nuclear power in the Democratic Party. He had successfully lobbied his party to change its official designation of nuclear power from a “transitional” to “main” source of energy. An aide to Mr. Ohata, who became Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism in January, said he was unavailable for an interview. As moves to strengthen oversight were put on the back burner, the new government dusted off the energy plan designed by Mr. Kano, the Tepco adviser and former lawmaker. It added fresh details, including plans to build 14 new reactors by 2030 and raise the share of electricity generated by nuclear power and minor sources of clean energy to 70 percent from 34 percent. What is more, Japan would make the sale of nuclear reactors and technology the central component of a long-term export strategy to energy-hungry developing nations. A new company, the International Nuclear Energy Development of Japan, was created to do just that. Its shareholders were made up of the country’s nine main nuclear plant operators, three manufacturers of nuclear reactors and the government itself. The nuclear power village was going global with the new company. The government took a 10 percent stake. Tepco took the biggest, with 20 percent, and one of its top executives was named the company’s first president.",2011-04-26T22:59:32.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Since the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union, Switzerland had been observing a de facto moratorium on building nuclear plants.

Only 43 percent of those polled after the failure of the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan said they would approve building such new facilities in the United States to generate electricity. That is a steep decline from the 57 percent who said in 2008 that they approved of new plants. That poll was taken at a time of soaring gas prices and mounting concerns about global warming that led to calls for a new national energy policy and that drove popular support for nuclear power to its highest level in three decades. Support for nuclear power has waxed and waned over the decades, going up as the power-hungry nation looked for ways to meet demand and driven down by nuclear accidents at home and abroad. Support for more nuclear power plants was 69 percent in 1977, the highest level ever recorded in a poll by The New York Times or CBS News. But two years later, it plummeted to 46 percent after the Three Mile Island accident near Harrisburg, Pa. After the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union, in 1986, support dropped to 34 percent in a CBS News poll. The new poll found that nearly 7 in 10 Americans think that nuclear power plants in the United States are generally safe. But nearly two-thirds of those polled said they were concerned that a major nuclear accident might occur in this country — including 3 in 10 who said they were “very concerned” by such a possibility. Fifty-eight percent of those polled said they did not think the federal government was adequately prepared to deal with a major nuclear accident. Still, 47 percent of those polled said that, over all, the benefits of nuclear power outweighed the risks; 38 percent said they did not. The nationwide telephone poll was conducted March 18-21 among 1,022 adults, and it has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. The unfolding crisis in Japan occurred just as many Americans believed that nuclear power was poised to make a comeback in the United States, more than three decades after the Three Mile Island accident. President Obama has spoken in his past two State of the Union addresses of the need to build more nuclear plants, and he has called for billions of dollars in federal loan guarantees for construction. Some environmental groups, and many members of Congress in both parties, have also increasingly come to consider nuclear power as a steady energy source that, since it does not emit carbon, could play an important role as the nation seeks to address concerns about climate change. But even before the Japan crisis, there were tremendous financial challenges for any new construction , and the number of plants that was expected to be built in the near future was small. Finding places to build new plants could also prove difficult: more than 6 in 10 of those polled said they would not approve of a nuclear plant in their community. Support was highest in the South, where plans are under way for new plants in South Carolina and Georgia , and in the Midwest. Attitudes toward nuclear power varied along partisan and gender lines, the poll found. A slim majority of Republicans said they approved of building more nuclear plants, while majorities of Democrats and independents disapproved. Republicans were also more likely to see the existing nuclear power plants as safe, and were more likely to say that the federal government was prepared to handle an accident, though most still said the government was not ready for such an emergency. And Republicans were less likely to disapprove of new nuclear plants in their areas: 50 percent of them said they did not want new nuclear plants nearby, compared with 69 percent of Democrats and 65 percent of independents. There was also a gender divide: while a majority of men said they approved of new nuclear plants, most women disapproved. Women were also significantly less likely than men to say that the benefits of nuclear power outweighed the risks, more likely to say that they were “very” concerned about a major accident and more likely to say that the events in Japan made them more afraid that a nuclear accident could occur in the United States. Mr. Obama received high marks for his handling of the crisis from all political groups. Nearly half of those polled said they were concerned that radiation from Japan could harm people in the United States, with the results similar across all regions. But their concern did not run very deep: only 17 percent said they were “very concerned” about the possibility, including just 13 percent of those who live in the West.",2011-03-23T01:10:52.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-u.s.

The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southern Ukraine briefly moved to emergency generators on Thursday after Russian shelling cut its external power supply, prompting the top director of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog to disparage the international community for failing to secure the complex. The nuclear plant, which is the largest in Europe, and the only one to ever be in the middle of active fighting, has now been forced to resort to its emergency diesel generators six times since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine a year ago, according to the U.N.’s top nuclear official, Rafael Mariano Grossi. “Each time, we are rolling a dice,” Mr. Grossi said on Thursday, “and if we allow this to continue time after time, then one day our luck will run out.” “I am astonished by the complacency,” added Mr. Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Later in the day, Ukraine’s national electric utility, Ukrenergo, said that the plant had been reconnected to the power grid after 11 hours. The European Atomic Energy Community — whose membership is composed of E.U. nations but which lies outside the authority of the European Parliament — and 49 countries made a joint appeal to the I.A.E.A., saying that Russia should leave the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, according to the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. “Nuclear terrorism and Russian blackmail must be stopped,” Mr. Shmyhal said on Twitter as he saluted the appeal. The dangers of being at the center of a war zone, including repeatedly moving to emergency power, pose a serious risk of nuclear catastrophe, experts say. Here’s a closer look at why. Image A satellite image showing the six reactors at the Zaporizhzhia complex. Credit... Maxar Technologies, via Associated Press ‘Offline’ nuclear plants still need power. Even through all of the reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant have been shut down, the equipment that cools their nuclear cores and spent fuel rods needs a constant source of power. If the cooling is interrupted, the heat from the nuclear material could melt through its containment, spewing radiation. The site is running out of diesel fuel. It’s important that a nuclear plant remains connected to an external power source, either the power grid or a backup. The Zaporizhzhia plant’s emergency generators are powered by diesel fuel, but there is only so much on site. When the generators were activated after the shelling on Thursday, there was enough fuel to keep the generators going for 15 days, according to a statement from the I.A.E.A. And the plant is near a very active front line. “The concern is that it’s difficult to get diesel to that part of the battlefield to refill the generators to make sure the power stays on,” said Amy J. Nelson, the Rubenstein Fellow in the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution and a nuclear security expert. During the previous periods when the plant was disconnected from external power, engineers raced to make repairs before the diesel fuel ran out. International nuclear inspectors have called the situation unsustainable and precarious. Image A Russian soldier outside the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in May. Credit... Associated Press The war presents other meltdown risks. Although the plant was designed to account for risks from natural disasters, plane crashes and the like, no nuclear facility has ever before been at the center of active fighting. Experts have a multitude of concerns. “It’s fire,” Ms. Nelson said. “It’s explosions from pressure building up.” She noted that fuel rods could become corroded and cause a nuclear accident. Any of these issues could disrupt power. Nuclear reactions produce heat that is channeled into steam to produce electricity, and any disturbance to the cooling process could cause a meltdown. Ms. Nelson referred to the events in Japan, in 2011, when an earthquake set off a tsunami that damaged the Fukushima nuclear complex, causing meltdowns. “The temperature in the reactor increased so much that the corrosion was accelerated and caused a leakage of fuel,” she said. If a power transformer is hit by shelling, that raises the risk of a fire. And cooling failures short of a meltdown could create pressure that might lead to an explosion.",2023-03-10T18:34:04.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire
58d643fa-1c02-4e25-bb02-2471c1f0ce45,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/25/world/asia/25myth.html,‘Safety Myth’ Left Japan Ripe for Nuclear Crisis,"SHIKA, Japan — Near a nuclear power plant facing the Sea of Japan, a series of exhibitions in a large public relations building here extols the virtues of the energy source with some help from “Alice in Wonderland.” “It’s terrible, just terrible,” the White Rabbit says in the first exhibit. “We’re running out of energy, Alice.” A Dodo robot figure, swiveling to address Alice and the visitors to the building, declares that there is an “ace” form of energy called nuclear power. It is clean, safe and renewable if you reprocess uranium and plutonium, the Dodo says. “Wow, you can even do that!” Alice says of nuclear power. “You could say that it’s optimal for resource-poor Japan!” Over several decades, Japan’s nuclear establishment has devoted vast resources to persuade the Japanese public of the safety and necessity of nuclear power. Plant operators built lavish, fantasy-filled public relations buildings that became tourist attractions. Bureaucrats spun elaborate advertising campaigns through a multitude of organizations established solely to advertise the safety of nuclear plants. Politicians pushed through the adoption of government-mandated school textbooks with friendly views of nuclear power. The result was the widespread adoption of the belief — called the “safety myth” — that Japan’s nuclear power plants were absolutely safe. Japan single-mindedly pursued nuclear power even as Western nations distanced themselves from it. The belief helps explains why in the only nation to have been attacked with atomic bombs, the Japanese acceptance of nuclear power was so strong that the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl barely registered. Even with the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, the reaction against nuclear power has been much stronger in Europe and the United States than in Japan itself. As the Japanese continue to search for answers to the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, some are digging deep into the national psyche and examining a national propensity to embrace a belief now widely seen as irrational. Because of this widespread belief in Japanese plants’ absolute safety, plant operators and nuclear regulators failed to adopt proper safety measures and advances in technology, like emergency robots, experts and government officials acknowledge. “In Japan, we have something called the ‘safety myth,’ ” Banri Kaieda , who runs the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which oversees the nuclear industry, said at a news conference at an International Atomic Energy Agency meeting in Vienna on Monday. “It’s a fact that there was an unreasonable overconfidence in the technology of Japan’s nuclear power generation.” As a result, he said, the nuclear industry’s “thinking about safety had a poor foundation.” Japan’s government has concentrated its propaganda and educational efforts on creating such national beliefs in the past, most notably during World War II. The push for nuclear power underpinned postwar Japan’s focus on economic growth and its dream of greater energy independence. But as the carefully fostered belief in nuclear safety has dissipated in the three months after the March 11 disaster, Japanese are increasingly blaming the nuclear establishment for Fukushima. In a politically apathetic country, tens of thousands have regularly held protests against nuclear power . Young Japanese have used social media to organize and publicize demonstrations that have been virtually ignored by major newspapers and television networks. A song, “It Was Always a Lie,” has become an anthem at the protests and a vehicle for Japanese anger on the Internet. Its author, a famous singer named Kazuyoshi Saito , wrote it by changing the lyrics of a love ballad, “I Always Liked You,” that he composed last year for a commercial for Shiseido, the cosmetics giant. Mr. Saito’s performance of the song, surreptitiously uploaded on YouTube and other sites, has gone viral. “If you walk across this country, you’ll find 54 nuclear reactors/School textbooks and commercials told us they were safe,” the song goes. “It was always a lie, it’s been exposed after all/It was really a lie that nuclear power is safe.” Caught Unprepared In the days after a giant tsunami knocked out Fukushima Daiichi’s cooling system, the prime minister’s office and the Tokyo Electric Power Company, or Tepco, the plant’s operator, wrestled over whether to inject cooling seawater into the reactor buildings to prevent catastrophic meltdowns, and then over how to do it. With radiation levels too high for workers to approach the reactors, the Japanese authorities floundered. They sent police trucks mounted with water cannons — equipment designed to disperse rioters — to spray water into the reactor buildings. Military helicopters flew over the buildings, dropping water that was scattered off course by strong winds, in a “performance, a kind of circus” that was aimed more at reassuring an increasingly alarmed Japanese population and American government, said Kenichi Matsumoto, an aide to Prime Minister Naoto Kan. What became clear was that Japan lacked some of the basic hardware to respond to a nuclear crisis and, after initial resistance, had to look abroad for help. For a country proud of its technology, the low point occurred on March 31 when it had to use a 203-foot-long water pump — shipped from China, an export market for Japanese nuclear technology — to inject 90 tons of fresh water into the No. 1 reactor building. But perhaps more than anything else, the absence of one particular technology was deeply puzzling: emergency robots. Japan, after all, is the world’s leader in robotics. It has the world’s largest force of mechanized workers. Its humanoid robots can walk and run on two feet, sing and dance, and even play the violin. But where were the emergency robots at Fukushima? The answer is that the operators and nuclear regulators, believing that accidents would never occur, steadfastly opposed the introduction of what they regarded as unnecessary technology. “The plant operators said that robots, which would premise an accident, were not needed,” said Hiroyuki Yoshikawa, 77, an engineer and a former president of the University of Tokyo, Japan’s most prestigious academic institution. “Instead, introducing them would inspire fear, they said. That’s why they said that robots couldn’t be introduced.” Even before the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979, Mr. Yoshikawa, a robotics expert, and other researchers began building emergency robots capable of responding to a nuclear accident, eventually producing a prototype called Mooty. The robots were resistant to high levels of radiation and capable of surmounting mounds of rubble. But the robots never made it into production, forcing Japan, in the aftermath of Fukushima, to rely on an emergency shipment of robots from iRobot , a company in Bedford, Mass., more famous for manufacturing the Roomba vacuum. On Friday, Tepco deployed the first Japanese-made robot, which was retrofitted recently to handle nuclear accidents, but workers had to retrieve it after it malfunctioned. The rejection of robots, Mr. Yoshikawa said, was part of the industry’s overall reluctance to improve maintenance and invest in new technologies. “That’s why the safety myth wasn’t just an empty slogan,” said Mr. Yoshikawa, now the director general of the Center for Research and Development Strategy at the Japan Science and Technology Agency. “It was a kind of mind-set that rejected progress through the introduction of new technology.” Entering a New Age The deliberate effort to rally Japanese behind nuclear power can be traced to the beginning of the atomic age, scholars and experts say. In August 1945, Yasuhiro Nakasone, a young naval officer who would become one of postwar Japan’s most powerful prime ministers, was stationed in western Japan. “I saw the nuclear mushroom cloud over Hiroshima,” Mr. Nakasone wrote in an essay in the 1960s. “At that moment, I sensed that the next age was the nuclear age.” For many Japanese like Mr. Nakasone, nuclear power became a holy grail — a way for Japan, whose lack of oil and other natural resources had led to World War II and defeat, to become more energy independent. The mastery of nuclear power would also open the possibility of eventually developing nuclear weapons, a subject that Japan secretly studied when Mr. Nakasone was defense minister in 1970. It was precisely because of nuclear power’s possible link to nuclear arms and its close ties to the United States that left-leaning politicians, academics and intellectuals became fierce opponents. As a countermeasure, proponents of nuclear power stressed its absolute safety, so that each side struck extreme positions, a standoff that lasts to this day. The nuclear establishment — led by Tepco among the utilities and the Ministry of Economy — spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising and educational programs emphasizing the safety of nuclear plants. The ministry’s division responsible for nuclear power has budgeted $12 million this year for those programs, said Takanobu Sugimoto, a division spokesman. Mr. Sugimoto said he “regretted” that the ministry might have “stressed only” the plants’ safety. The government and the utilities encouraged the creation of many organizations that propagated the message of safety. One of the oldest, the Japan Atomic Energy Relations Organization , receives 40 percent of its financing from two ministries that oversee nuclear power and 60 percent from Japan’s plant operators. In addition to producing information promoting nuclear power, the organization sends nuclear power experts to speak at secondary schools and colleges, at no cost. Mitsuhiro Yokote, 67, the executive managing director of the organization and a former nuclear engineer at the Kansai Electric Power Company , acknowledged that the experts conveyed the message that nuclear plants were absolutely safe. Mr. Yokote said he “regretted” that his organization had contributed to the safety myth. In a country where people tend to reflexively trust the government, assurances about the safety of Japan’s plants were enough to reassure even those at greatest risk. In Oma, a fishing town in northern Japan where a plant is currently under construction , Chernobyl made no impression on local residents considering the plant back in the 1980s. 12 Photos View Slide Show › “What could we do but believe what the government told us?” said Masaru Takahashi, 67, a member of a fishing union in Oma. “We were told that they were absolutely safe.” A Public Relations Drive After Chernobyl, the nuclear establishment made sure that Japanese kept believing in safety. The plant operators built or renovated the public relations buildings — called “P.R. buildings” — attached to their plants. Before Chernobyl, the buildings were simple facilities intended to appeal to “adult men interested in technical matters,” said Noriya Sumihara , an anthropologist at Tenri University who has researched the facilities. Male guides wearing industrial uniforms took visitors around exhibits consisting mostly of wall panels. But after Chernobyl, the facilities were transformed into elaborate theme parks geared toward young mothers, the group that research showed was most worried about nuclear plants and radiation, Mr. Sumihara said. Women of childbearing age, whose presence alone was meant to reassure the visitors, were hired as guides. In Higashidori, a town in northern Japan, one of the country’s newest P.R. buildings is built on the theme of Tonttu, a forest with resident dwarfs. The buildings also holds events with anime characters to attract children and young parents, said Yoshiki Oikawa, a spokesman for the Tohoku Electric Power Company , which manages the site with Tepco. Here in Shika, more than 100,000 guests last year visited the P.R. building where Alice discovers the wonders of nuclear power. The Caterpillar reassures Alice about radiation and the Cheshire Cat helps her learn about the energy source. Instead of going down a rabbit hole, Alice shrinks after eating a candy and enters a 1:25 scale model of the Shika nuclear plant nearby. Since the Fukushima disaster, visitors have started questioning the safety of nuclear power, said Asuka Honda, 27, a guide here. Many were pregnant women worried about the effects of radiation on their unborn children. But the presence of Ms. Honda and other guides, mostly women in their late 20s, seemed to reassure them. The nuclear establishment also made sure that government-mandated school textbooks underemphasized information that could cast doubt on the safety of nuclear power. In Parliament, the campaign was led by Tokio Kano , a Tepco vice president who became a lawmaker in 1998. Mr. Kano, who declined to be interviewed for this article, returned to Tepco as an adviser after retiring from Parliament last year. In 2004, under the influence of Mr. Kano and other proponents of nuclear power, education officials ordered revisions to textbooks before endorsing them. In one junior high school social studies textbook, a reference to the growing antinuclear movement in Europe was deleted. In another, a reference to Chernobyl was relegated to a footnote. The effect could be seen in opinion polls that even after Fukushima have indicated that young Japanese are the strongest proponents of nuclear power. The nuclear establishment itself came to believe its own safety myth and “became entangled in its own net,” said Hitoshi Yoshioka , an author of a book on the history of Japan’s nuclear power and a member of a panel established by the prime minister to investigate the causes of the Fukushima disaster. He said that helped explain why, at Fukushima, Tepco failed to carry out emergency measures in case of a complete loss of power, which is what happened when the tsunami hit in March. Others have said that the nuclear establishment’s embrace of the safety myth also makes it possible to understand what, in hindsight, was the most glaring hole in the safety measures at Japan’s nuclear plants. In the country that gave the world the word tsunami, few measures were taken at Fukushima Daiichi or elsewhere to protect plants against the giant waves. Neither the Dodo nor the Caterpillar makes any mention of tsunamis to Alice.",2011-06-25T04:56:16.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Credit... Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters Ukrainian officials were still working on Friday to fully restore operations at the country’s nuclear power plants, two days after Russian missile strikes that forced utility crews to scramble to stabilize the country’s crippled energy grid and raised further concerns about the nuclear perils of the war. Ukraine typically relies on nuclear power for more than half of its energy, an uncommonly high rate of dependence. It has four sprawling nuclear plant complexes across the country that host 15 reactors. The Russian attacks on Wednesday triggered emergency protections at the three plants that remain under Ukraine’s control and required a halt to production. Reactors at the Rivne, South Ukraine and Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plants were slowly being restarted and will be reconnected to the grid when the power systems are ready, Petro Kotin, the head of the Ukrainian national energy company, Energoatom, said on Thursday. Wednesday marked the first time in the 40-year history of the country’s nuclear power industry that all operating nuclear facilities were shut down and had to rely on emergency diesel generators, officials said. For months, attacks in and around the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have left engineers racing from one crisis to the next as it has repeatedly been disconnected from the national energy grid. External power was restored on Thursday morning at the plant a day after it was lost, according to the United Nation’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has had inspectors at the facility since early September. That plant, Europe’s largest, has been offline since September but still needs electricity to keep cooling equipment running around the clock and ward off a nuclear meltdown. “The complete and simultaneous loss of off-site power for Ukraine’s nuclear power plants shows that the situation for nuclear safety and security in the country is become increasingly precarious, challenging and potentially dangerous,” Rafael Grossi, the U.N. agency’s director general, said on Thursday. “This would have been completely unimaginable before this tragic war. It is extremely concerning.” The agency has started providing assistance at Ukraine’s other nuclear power plants after it was requested by Kyiv, Mr. Grossi said. “We must do everything to prevent a nuclear accident at any of these facilities, which would only add to the terrible suffering we are already witnessing in Ukraine,” he said. Snow and freezing rain worsened the plight of millions of Ukrainians who remained without power Thursday evening. Officials said electricity had been restored to meet about half of the country’s consumption needs as of 7 p.m. The city government in Kyiv, the capital, said on Friday morning that water had been fully restored but that half of the city’s housing stock was still in emergency power outage mode. A significant number of thermal and hydroelectric plants were back in operation but restarting nuclear plants takes more time, Ukrenergo, the national electric utility, said in its Telegram channel. Authorities were also prioritizing restoring energy to critical infrastructure — gas distribution, sewage treatment, and hospitals — before household consumers, the utility said. “Energy workers, utility workers, business — everyone is doing their part to give light again,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in his nightly address. “This is truly a nationwide task — Ukraine is working as unitedly as possible in this.”",2022-11-25T11:07:43.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

As your article points out, nuclear power plants are supposed to be able to protect against armed terrorists. Yet a recently released mental patient, armed with little more than a Plymouth station wagon, was able to enter the ""protected area"" of a nuclear power plant and elude capture for four hours. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission acknowledges that plant operators at Three Mile Island did not know the number of intruders, where they were or whether they were armed. It would appear that security at Three Mile Island failed to protect the nuclear power plant. But the Nuclear Regulatory Commission claims that it is not clear any regulations had been violated. If indeed the regulations were not violated, then perhaps it is time to rewrite them so that they require adequate protection of nuclear power plants. Unfortunately, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is headed in the opposite direction. Responding to industry pressure and to the deregulatory agenda of the Bush-Quayle Administration, the commission has embarked on an effort to relax a number of rules and regulations, including those supposed to protect against security breaches like the one at Three Mile Island.

f4d4b212-241d-407a-b1d5-1d04626cf62d,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/18/business/international/britain-to-let-chinese-buy-into-nuclear-power-plants.html,Chinese to Invest in British Nuclear Power,"LONDON — Britain said on Thursday that it would allow Chinese firms to buy stakes in British nuclear power plants and eventually acquire majority holdings. The agreement, which comes with caveats, opens the way for China’s fast-growing nuclear industry to play a significant role in Britain’s plans to proceed with construction of its first new reactor in nearly two decades. George Osborne, chancellor of the Exchequer, made the announcement on Thursday while visiting a nuclear power station in southern China. The project fits into Britain’s overall plan to deliver at least 12 new nuclear reactors at five sites by 2030. It contradicts countries like Germany and Japan that have pulled back from nuclear power since the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011. Britain has nine aging nuclear plants. Under an agreement signed by the two countries, British companies like Rolls-Royce and International Nuclear Services could also win a bigger role in China’s nuclear power expansion, according to an e-mail from the British Embassy in Beijing that summarized Mr. Osborne’s statement. China is already moving ahead with its own ambitious plan to build dozens of domestic nuclear power stations in coming years. China has 17 reactors now. After an earthquake and tsunami led to partial meltdowns of three nuclear reactors in Fukushima, China imposed a moratorium on construction for many months. The pace of construction has not fully recovered, and China has since reduced its target for nuclear power capacity in 2015 to 40 gigawatts, from 50. China’s interest in the British nuclear industry signals a break from a mostly domestic focus. While China has engaged in extensive cooperation with Pakistan in nuclear power, its industry has mostly concentrated on an enormous building program at home. Mr. Osborne’s announcement incited a debate over which type of strategic assets European countries should open to investment from China. “Cooperation on civil nuclear energy with China has been going on for a long time, and there are many French companies working with the Chinese on these issues, so it’s not something I find difficult to accept,” said Michel Barnier, the European commissioner responsible for the internal markets, speaking in London. But, Mr. Barnier, added, “The only point I would make is that it is in Europe’s general interest that Europeans reflect on what are their strategic assets. Each country has its own vision of what is strategically important and I think it would be useful to have more of a common vision or strategy on this question.” Britain’s energy market is already dominated by European giants, including E.D.F., the French state-controlled power company that is supposed to oversee construction and eventually operate the proposed Hinkley Point project in southwest England, and the German utility E.On. Opening its nuclear power industry to Chinese investment raises questions over Beijing’s influence in a highly sensitive energy sector. The British government said that any Chinese investments had to meet strict standards for safety and security. Chinese investors will most likely have a minority stake in the Hinkley Point project, the government indicated Thursday, adding that “Over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes.” Antony Froggatt, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, a research institute in London, said there were few concerns with a Chinese role because of the partnership with the French in China. “If there were a falling-out politically, I think they would be more likely to withdraw funding than to switch off the lights,” he said. While Germany wants to shut all of its nuclear plants by 2022 and shift almost entirely to wind and solar power by 2050, Britain is betting big on nuclear power. Though it is also pushing into production of shale oil and gas, Britain aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by the mid-2020s in large part by renewing the older nuclear power plants. But Britain’s ability to succeed with China’s help is anything but assured. Details of the planned Hinkley Point project in Somerset, including energy price guarantees offered by the British government that could result in higher power bills for consumers, are expected to be announced early next week. Britain says that there are no direct state subsidies for the project, which is now estimated to cost about $22 billion. Europe’s regulators who police state subsidies could dispute that figure. If and when the new plant, Hinkley Point C, comes fully online, it will supply about 7 percent of Britain’s electricity. That would be enough power for five million homes, with the added benefit of no carbon emissions. But the negotiations over the Hinkley Point plant have been long and difficult. Originally, E.D.F., which already operates 15 nuclear plants in Britain, had intended to be in partnership with Centrica, the owner of British Gas. But Centrica withdrew from discussions, saying the economic case for a partnership was not strong enough. That setback underscores how building a new nuclear plant in the West is expensive and fraught with risk. Two French-designed plants under construction at Flamanville, France, and Olkiluoto, Finland, have been plagued by technical problems and huge cost overruns. Last year, two big German utilities, R.W.E. and E.On, decided not to proceed with construction of a plant that had been planned for Wales, largely because of the costs and the uncertainty of getting a return on their investment. E.D.F.'s stock price, along with those of many European utilities, has been under pressure of late. Kirsty Alexander, head of communications for the Nuclear Industry Association, a trade association for Britain’s nuclear industry, said E.D.F. was bringing on partners because “it’s the huge upfront capital investment. It’s billions and billions of pounds. With nuclear you don’t see any return on your investment for 15 years.” A possible investor is China General Nuclear Power, which is the majority stakeholder in the Taishan nuclear plant in Guangdong Province in southern China, where Mr. Osborne made his announcement on Thursday. China passed the United States in overall generating capacity in 2011 and now has a total of 1,145 gigawatts, compared with a little more than 1,000 gigawatts in the United States. Nuclear power represents 1.1 percent of China’s electricity generating capacity, compared with nearly 10 percent in the United States. In terms of electricity actually generated, as opposed to capacity, nuclear is about 2 percent of the total in China and 19 percent in the United States.",2013-10-17T11:11:33.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-international-business

You imply that the antinuclear movement is a United States phenomenon, but nuclear power has never faced such determined opposition around the world. In Western Europe, France remains the only country with an active nuclear construction program, but France plans to order only one new plant in the next four years. The country has also seen an upswing in demonstrations - from across the political spectrum - against nuclear plants and waste dumps. Britain's hopes for a new line of plants, based on the Sizewell-B P.W.R. reactor, have collapsed. This followed government attempts to get a resistant financial community to swallow the uneconomic nuclear stations. Elsewhere in Europe, the talk is of wastes and decommissioning, not construction of new plants. Glasnost in the Soviet Union has been harsh on nuclear power advocates, with at least 10 plants closed or canceled in the last two years. This month, Hungary canceled plans to build four Soviet-style nuclear plants. Faced with the largest popular movement since World War II, Japanese industry and government are scaling back ambitious nuclear expansion plans. Taiwan saw its third attempt to construct more plants stopped by domestic opposition this year. South Korea saw its first anti nuclear demonstration a year ago; now the government faces a coalition that has succeeded in halting planned expansion and is calling for shutdowns. The notion that there are new environmentally benign and safe designs of nuclear plants that will alter public opposition is misconceived and not even shared by some in the industry. A study by the British Atomic Energy Authority found that the new designs may be just as vulnerable to structural failures as the old. Even the industry's trade journal, Nucleonics Week, states that ''experts are flatly unconvinced that safety has been achieved - or even substantially advanced - by the new designs.'' If companies say the newly designed nuclear power plants will be cheaper to build than coal-fired power plants, I say let them pay for them on their own. We've already poured a trillion dollars into nuclear power since World War II. I'd rather spend the money on cleaning up nuclear wastes and decommissioning the numerous civilian nuclear plants that are being closed, including Rancho Seco in California and Fort St. Vrain in Colorado, an ''advanced'' high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor that didn't work. You call for environmentalists to help create conditions for public acceptance of nuclear power. I remain doubtful that safe and cheap nuclear power, free of waste and proliferation problems, exists. The last 40 years haven't taught me otherwise. Until the manufacturers put their money where their mouth is, all I'll see is one more handout for another white elephant.

Still, the last American nuclear power plant to enter operation was ordered in 1973. Since then, safety requirements, which increased after the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island, have kept the industry from expanding. It has also been plagued by financial woes, including high interest rates and long construction times, stretching the average time to put a new plant in service to 14 years and souring Wall Street on financing nuclear power plants. The Bush energy plan could give a substantial boost to the industry. It declares the technology much safer than it was 20 years ago. It says the administration should encourage the relicensing of nuclear plants, which would not require Congressional action, and should seek legislation to reduce taxes that it says impede mergers of nuclear utilities. But it still has no solution for the complex problem of nuclear-waste disposal. Plants now store nuclear waste on site, waiting for a national repository. ''The Department of Energy is over a decade behind schedule for accepting nuclear waste from utilities,'' the report concedes. Studies to determine whether Yucca Mountain, Nev., is suitable for a repository have dragged on. The report echoes an industry idea to add reactors to sites that already have them. This approach could eliminate the highly contentious issue of finding new sites for such plants. ''Many U.S. nuclear plant sites were designed to host four to six reactors, and most operate only two or three,'' the report states. Polls show that Americans are less concerned about nuclear power than they are about coal, largely because nuclear power is cleaner and does not contribute to global warming. KATHARINE Q.

In the months before his election, President Moon Jae-in had vowed not to allow any new reactors. When he made that pledge, five nuclear power plants were under construction, three of them near completion. Mr. Moon said that he would scrap the other two, which were both in the early stages. Since Mr. Moon took office in May, however, the fate of those two reactors has become the center of a raging debate over nuclear power in South Korea , and antinuclear groups were quick to condemn the decision on Friday. Opponents of nuclear power, who have gained momentum in South Korea since the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011 and supported Mr. Moon during his campaign, wanted him to block the two reactors. But conservative media outlets and politicians, as well as the nuclear industry itself, have been just as vocal, insisting that nuclear remained a cheap, clean and reliable source of energy for South Korea, which produces neither crude oil nor natural gas. In June, Mr. Moon proposed an independent panel to study public opinion on the issue and make a recommendation. The panel worked with 471 citizens from various walks of life and conducted extensive surveys. While the panel was at work, Mr. Moon suspended the construction of the two reactors, both inside the Gori nuclear power complex in Ulsan, in the southeast of South Korea. On Friday, after three months of study, the panel endorsed a return to construction. Three-fifths of the panel supported the projects, while the remaining members were opposed. Mr. Moon’s office said it would honor the recommendation. Some villagers opposed to nuclear power who had gathered in front of a government building on Friday cried when they heard the panel’s decision. Civic groups campaigning against nuclear energy later said they respected its recommendation. But they lamented the influence of pronuclear groups who have carried out extensive publicity campaigns in recent weeks, promoting the benefits of nuclear power and warning that a phaseout could damage the economy. “After 40 years of nuclear power, special interest groups connected to the nuclear power industry have taken root everywhere in South Korean society, blinding the eyes of the people,” the Korean Federation for Environmental Movements said in a statement. The panel’s advice appeared to give Mr. Moon political cover on a highly divisive issue, saving him from having to order the costly abandonment of the effort. The government-controlled Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Company, the country’s sole nuclear operator, has already spent $1.4 billion on the construction of the last two reactors. But the panel supported Mr. Moon’s long-term policy of weaning South Korea off nuclear energy, with 53 percent urging that nuclear power be scaled back, while nearly 10 percent wanted it expanded. More than a third favored maintaining current levels. South Korea is the world’s fifth-largest nuclear energy producer, with 24 reactors providing one-third of its electricity needs. The panel “recommends that the government make energy policy decisions in a direction of scaling down nuclear power generation,” said its chairman, Kim Ji-hyung, during a nationally televised news conference on Friday. Besides the five plants under construction, South Korea had planned to build six more. Mr. Moon has scrapped those plans. His government has also vowed not to extend the operation of existing reactors when they reach their life expectancy. In June, South Korea retired its oldest nuclear plant, Gori Reactor No. 1, which went into operation in 1978. Ten others will reach the end of their design life by 2030. Mr. Moon’s conservative predecessors championed nuclear power as a cheap energy source that they said helped drive the country’s export-dependent manufacturing sector and kept consumer electricity bills low. They had also hoped to develop nuclear into an export industry in its own right. South Korea is building four reactors for the United Arab Emirates under a $20 billion contract. But Mr. Moon has promised to invest more in renewable energy sources. He also said he would issue no new licenses for coal power plants. Skepticism over nuclear energy has grown in South Korea in recent years. Not long after the Fukushima disaster, South Koreans learned that nuclear plants across their country included parts whose safety test results had been faked . The country is also running out of space for high-level radioactive wastes, but no town has been willing to host a central depository. A 5.8 magnitude earthquake near some of the plants last year also raised concerns.",2017-10-20T12:28:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Its use of nuclear power to generate nearly 80 percent of its electricity allows it to maintain the lowest per-capita carbon dioxide emissions level among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. True, nuclear power produces radioactive waste, which must be isolated for hundreds of years. But the amounts are relatively small and can be safely and economically managed, as shown in Europe.

But that would be little comfort to a utility confronted by the staggering economic consequences of a core-meltdown accident. The loss of public confidence that would result from such an event (even one with no public-health consequences at all) would doubtless mean a moratorium on public acceptance of nuclear power for the foreseeable future. As you correctly note, greater understanding of science does not mean that we regulators or our licensees can afford to demand anything less than the very highest standards of performance in this high-technology enterprise of nuclear-power generation.

The nuclear plans, which are still in the early stages, are part of an ambitious proposal by Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, to triple its electricity output by 2025 while weaning itself off imported oil and onto local coal, gas, and renewable and atomic energy. A 2006 decree by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono calls for 5 percent of electricity to come from nuclear and other “new energy and renewable energy” sources by then. Proposals to build plants have been floated despite years of protests by environmentalists and community activists who argue that Indonesia, an archipelago that largely sits on a number of major fault lines, is too unstable to safely support nuclear power. As images from Japan’s disaster dredge up memories of the 2004 Asian tsunami — in which nearly 170,000 Indonesians died — these concerns have only grown. “Nuclear power plants are inherently dangerous. And if we build them in a country as prone to disasters as Indonesia, located on the Ring of Fire, the Pacific Rim, we’re creating the potential for a tremendous disaster,” said Arif Fiyanto, a climate and energy campaigner for Southeast Asia at the environmental group Greenpeace. “Indonesia has probably worse disaster characteristics than Japan,” Mr. Fiyanto said. “Japan has an excellent safety culture and an excellent early warning system. For the time being, Indonesia — we have to be honest — has been left far behind when it comes to this.” Deeply entrenched corruption and a culture of corner-cutting on other large projects are additional causes for concern, he said. The most prominent project is a proposal to build two plants with a combined capacity of 18,000 megawatts by 2022 in the provincial government of Bangka-Belitung, between the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. The government is seeking bids for a feasibility study at the site. Supporters say both sites are far from Indonesia’s most active fault lines. Other sites have been suggested on the densely populated island of Java, as well as Madura, Kalimantan and Sulawesi. Adiwardojo, the head of nuclear energy development at Indonesia’s National Nuclear Energy Agency, said that concerns about a disaster like that of Japan’s were misplaced because any plants Indonesia would use would have technology far more advanced than that of the four-decade-old reactors at the Fukushima plant in Japan. Indonesia is carrying out its assessment of potential nuclear sites using standards and guidance from the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mr. Adiwardojo said. “The important thing isn’t that Indonesia is on the Ring of Fire or there are tsunamis, so we can’t build,” he said. “No, the important thing is that we fulfill the requirements.” Until the recent crisis, a number of governments in Southeast Asia — which, with the exception of one inactive plant in the Philippines, has no nuclear power — had been seriously reconsidering nuclear power to cope with growing populations and rising affluence. Events in Japan, however, have led the government of Thailand to announce a freeze on developing the country’s first nuclear power plants, while the Philippines has discarded plans to activate the shelved Bataan reactor. In Malaysia, the government has said it has not yet decided whether to proceed with its nuclear power plans. But in Vietnam, plans to build a series of reactors, the first of which is projected to go online by 2020, have not been disrupted. In China, meanwhile, the government announced on Wednesday that it was suspending approvals of new nuclear power plants and stepping up inspections at its existing plants. In Indonesia, the move toward nuclear power has hardly been relentless. The country looks almost certain to miss a target set by Parliament to have nuclear power online between 2015 and 2019. Another flagship proposal to build a plant on Java’s coastal Muria Peninsula, at the foot of a dormant volcano, has also lost steam in the face of local opposition — although Mr. Adiwardojo says it is still part of the government’s plans. Within the presidential advisory body tasked with planning Indonesia’s power development, the National Energy Council, opinions are split. Herman Darnel Ibrahim, a council member, said nuclear power needed to be studied more but was unfeasible in areas where strong community objection persisted. “To make the people happy, that’s the bottom line of development,” he said. “If we build something and the people are not happy with it, they are worried, then maybe that development is meaningless,” Mr. Ibrahim said. But for the majority of those drafting Indonesia’s energy future, nuclear power remains a necessity. “We have to consider our energy supply in the long term,” said Herman Agustiawan, another council member. “Our population is 240 million. We have no choice.”",2011-03-18T03:13:53.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-global-business

That factor is the nuclear Navy. Its tradition of routine excellence in operation, established and rigidly enforced by Admiral Hyman Rickover, infused our nuclear-power program from the outset, as Navy veterans moved to the industry. The Navy's influence has increased further in recent years, as the industry has responded to the lessons learned from Three Mile Island. Everyone who serves in the nuclear Navy develops a deep and lasting respect for radiation and nuclear energy. I spent 16 years on nuclear submarines, living and working in extremely close quarters with about 100 other men - and with a nuclear power plant. We did not have the protection of the massive concrete-and-steel containment buildings that surround commercial nuclear power plants in the United States - which represent one of the key differences with the Chernobyl nuclear plant. In our case the containment was the hull of the submarine, and we were inside. When you work, eat, sleep and live under the ocean with a nuclear reactor, you quickly learn what ''shipshape'' means. The slightest mistake can seriously complicate the work of the crew in the tight workspace of a submarine. A mistake that involves radiation could also endanger the health of your fellow crew members. Even worse, we often thought, the slightest mistake meant that we would have to explain it to the Admiral. After years of commanding submarines and training nuclear engineers, the Navy's cautious, ''safety-first'' attitude had become deeply ingrained. Like other Navy veterans, I felt it was extremely important to apply the same approach in industry. I joined the New York Power Authority as first resident manager of the Indian Point 3 Nuclear Power Plant in 1976. From my first meeting with the Trustees of the Power Authority, it was clear that their No. 1 priority in the operation of Indian Point 3 would always be safety. This philosophy gave me the opportunity to emphasize two of the most important lessons from my Navy years: plant cleanliness and personnel training. Keeping a nuclear power plant clean is essential. A sloppy plant, with equipment in disarray or ''hot spots'' of radiation would represent not only a potential health hazard to employees, but also an unnecessary level of expense, because internal operations would take more time. We have prided ourselves on its cleanliness. That has paid off in the form of an excellent record of occupational safety for the workers. Probably because I had served as commanding officer of the Navy Nuclear Power School in Bainbridge, Md. I was also a firm believer in high-quality training programs. I was happy to learn that Indian Point had been one of the first nuclear-power locations in the country that had a control-room simulator on-site for the training of reactor operators. It was installed by Con Edison. We are now building a second simulator, which will increase the time available for training. The Navy-style quality of operation has become even more evident since the 1979 Three Mile Island accident. That mishap may have proved that reactor safety systems do, indeed, protect the public, especially the special containment buildings that surround nuclear plants. But it also taught the industry that very expensive accidents can occur if we get too casual about nuclear power operation. With an essentially spotless record stretching over two decades, some in the nuclear power industry in 1979 might have been taking safety too much for granted. I know that when I heard about the Three Mile Island accident, my initial reaction was disbelief. Later, the reactions of many in the industry changed to determination - determination to achieve the level of excellence that it knew was necessary. Since, Three Mile Island, the nuclear-power industry has changed significantly. The industry established a new Institute for Nuclear Power Operations, which is closely monitoring the operations of all commercial nuclear power plants in the United States and advising on how they can achieve a greater level of excellence. Its staff, with many Navy nuclear-service veterans included, adopted the stringent Navy traditions for safety and training. An even newer National Academy of Nuclear Training is assuring that virtually everyone who works at a nuclear plant -operators, supervisors, technicians - is thoroughly trained, tested and regularly re-accredited. These new efforts are having results. In nearly every performance category monitored by the institute, the industry has shown improvement year after year, indicating progress in both safety and the economic performance of the plants. At Indian Point 3, we have been fully participating in these industrywide programs and making our own constant improvements. Since January 1984 the plant has been available to generate electricity 83 percent of the time - including the time that it was out of service for scheduled refueling and maintenance. In the last review we received from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Indian Point 3 was rated in Category I, representing the top level of performance, in six of the 10 activities evaluated, and in the second category for the other four. It seems clear that United States nuclear power plants are now operating with a higher degree of excellence in safety and overall performance than ever before. Three Mile Island may have reminded us of the need for that excellence. But I like to think that much of the training and philosophical dedication to achieving it stemmed from the nuclear Navy.",1986-05-25T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,westchester-weekly-desk-new-york

However, it missed the mark on what's really behind the so-called economic ''success'' of the French program. First, look at what ''state control'' over the French nuclear power program means: heavy, taxpayer-funded subsidies for the nuclear power industry, which grossly distort the real costs of nuclear-generated electricity, and total Federal pre-emptive authority over all local and state bodies for licensing, site selection and construction of nuclear reactors. Furthermore, there is no requirement that nuclear plants be economically or environmentally preferable to alternative energy sources. Continued construction of nuclear reactors in France has led to substantial electricity surpluses, which create a need for further electrification in home, office and industry. France has become a veritable electricity junkie, whose policy has all but discouraged efforts to promote the efficient uses of energy. It is doubtful that those Americans who last fall read George Bush's lips are going to embrace such a concept. Since Americans account for 5 percent of the world's population but consume 25 percent of its energy, we should be exploring the benefits of energy efficiency. France's ride on the nuclear-power rollercoaster might be just the thing we want to avoid.

He emphasized the company’s commitment to the rapidly growing renewable energy sector. He said the decision was also “an answer” to political and social opposition to nuclear power in Germany. Siemens, which built all of Germany’s 17 nuclear power plants, is the first big company to announce such a shift in strategy. But other German companies involved in the nuclear energy industry are also reconsidering their options. In May, Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the accident at the nuclear power station in Fukushima, Japan, had convinced her that Germany should look to other power sources. The decision represented a turnaround for Mrs. Merkel, who a year ago agreed to prolong the life of the country’s nuclear plants by an average of 12 years. Nuclear power accounts for 23 percent of electricity production in Germany. The government is putting in place an ambitious plan to increase the share of electricity generated from renewable sources to 35 percent by 2020, up from around 18 percent now. Mr. Löscher called the government’s plans for renewable energy “the project of the century.” Although the government’s goal has met with skepticism in some quarters, he said the 35 percent figure was “achievable.” Mr. Löscher said the shift in strategy meant that Siemens would drop plans to cooperate with Rosatom, the Russian state-controlled nuclear power company that is planning to build dozens of nuclear plants throughout Russia over the coming two decades. Siemens might seek cooperation with Rosatom in other areas, Mr. Löscher said. The Siemens decision does not amount to a boycott of the nuclear energy industry. A spokesman said the company would continue to make systems that could be used in nuclear power stations. “We will provide conventional steam turbines that can be used for nuclear power plants and conventional power plants,” Alfons Benzinger, a spokesman for Siemens’s energy business, said Sunday. The energy division is Siemens’s second-largest in terms of revenue. Last year, the conglomerate had total revenue of €76 billion, or $105 billion, and net income of €4.1 billion. Of that, the energy division contributed €3.6 billion. Mr. Benzinger said the shift in strategy would not have a negative impact on the company’s overall sales. Siemens, which has more than 400,000 employees worldwide, makes products as diverse as high-speed trains and sophisticated medical equipment. It is now one of the world’s largest providers of environmental technologies, which last year generated €28 billion of its total revenue. Siemens said last year that its renewable energy unit — which is part of its environmental technologies division — had the strongest growth of any of its lines of business.",2011-09-19T06:33:45.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-global-business

Beijing may have come up with a solution: floating nuclear power plants. A state-owned company, China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, is planning to build a fleet of the vessels to provide electricity to remote locations including offshore oil platforms and the contentious man-made islands, the state-run newspaper Global Times reported on Friday. The paper quoted an executive at the company, Liu Zhengguo, as saying that “demand is pretty strong” for the floating power stations, which would be built by one of its subsidiaries. In January, Xu Dazhe, the director of the China Atomic Energy Authority, told reporters in Beijing that China was planning to develop offshore floating nuclear energy plants, saying they “must undergo a rigorous, scientific evaluation,” but also linking these to China’s desire to become a “maritime power.” Mr. Xu said at the time that developing China’s nuclear power-generating capacity was part of the country’s five-year economic development plan, which runs through 2020. China has more civilian nuclear power stations under construction than any other country. China would not be the first country to employ floating nuclear power plants. In the 1960s, the United States Army installed a nuclear reactor inside the hull of a World War II freighter to provide electricity for the Panama Canal Zone. And nuclear power has been on vessels since 1955, when the commanding officer of the Nautilus , an American submarine, sent word that the craft was “underway on nuclear power.” Since then, nuclear reactors have provided propulsion — and electrical power — for ships like American aircraft carriers and Russian icebreakers. Typhoons regularly cross the South China Sea, and ships and submarines that run on nuclear power generally have the means to quickly sail away from a storm. It is unclear how mobile or seaworthy these reactor ships will be. Safety regulations for the seaborne reactors are being drawn up and reviewed, Global Times said, quoting Tang Bo, an official at China’s National Nuclear Safety Administration. David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer and the director of the Nuclear Safety Project for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that in the event of a major nuclear accident at a floating barge, like a meltdown of the reactor core, winds could carry radioactivity to large population centers. “The floating nuke accident scenario also carries with it the potential for molten parts of the reactor core burning through the bottom of the barge to reach the water below,” Mr. Lochbaum wrote in an email. “The water is good for cooling, but not good for containment.” In the 1970s, an industry consortium called Offshore Power Systems also had plans for floating nuclear power plants in the United States. An electric utility had ordered a plant that would have been moored outside Atlantic City. The facility, which would have been built in Florida, was canceled, Mr. Lochbaum said. The Army’s floating nuclear reactor in the Panama Canal Zone provided power during the late 1960s and into the 1970s to the grid in what was then United States territory. But China would be placing floating atomic power stations at islands that until recently did not exist in seas claimed by several nations. The artificial islands built by the Chinese in the past two years in disputed waters of the South China Sea have stoked tensions with neighbors, especially the Philippines and Vietnam, and prompted the United States to assert its right to transit the area freely by sailing navy ships close to the islands, often shadowed by Chinese vessels. In February, the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington reported that the Chinese were probably building radar facilities on several of the islands. That is in addition to airstrips capable of handling large jets like one on Fiery Cross Reef , harbors to berth seagoing vessels, lighthouses and large buildings such as barracks. All that requires electricity, provided now by generators and augmented by limited solar and wind power, said Gregory B. Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at C.S.I.S. Mr. Poling said it was too soon to tell how a possible deployment of the floating nuclear power stations would play out in the complicated politics of the South China Sea, though he said it was “potentially worrisome.” “But it appears that the idea hasn’t gotten any farther than conceptualization yet, so we seem to have years to wait before we find out,” Mr. Poling wrote in an email. A rendering of a possible Chinese floating nuclear power station was published on the English-language website of Global Times’s parent company, the Communist Party’s flagship newspaper, People’s Daily.

As members of a select scientific panel convened immediately after the Chernobyl accident, my colleagues and I established that the Chernobyl disaster tells us about the deficiencies of the Soviet political and administrative system rather than about problems with nuclear power. The design of the Chernobyl reactor was fundamentally faulty, having a built-in instability. In its operation on the critical day, all safety rules were totally ignored. Moreover, the electrical engineer who was put in charge of it had no knowledge of nuclear power, let alone of the instability of this particular reactor. By contrast, nuclear power plants that operate in the Western world are designed and built so as to preclude any possibility of a Chernobyl-type accident. In addition, Western plants are professionally operated in a manner infinitely superior to the Soviet practice at the time of the accident. In fact, in more than a quarter-century, with 112 nuclear power plants operating in the United States and an additional 200 similar ones operating throughout the world, the safety and environmental record of Western, non-Chernobyl nuclear power has been remarkable. No death or serious injury has been caused by radiation from any American-style light-water reactor anywhere in the world in 30 years of commercial nuclear power. Right now, the world needs nuclear energy sources to help reduce the massive burning of fossil fuels and their recognized environmental impact. Nuclear power is a major component of the solution to dependence on insecure and politically troublesome supplies of imported oil and also to the danger of global warming.

Its completion is a decade behind schedule. PARIS — On the windswept coast of Flamanville, an industrial city in northwest France facing the choppy waters of the English Channel, a soaring concrete dome houses one of the world’s most powerful nuclear reactors. But when this hulking giant will begin supplying power to France’s electrical grid is anyone’s guess. Construction is a full decade behind schedule and 12 billion euros, or $13 billion, over budget. Plans to start operations this year have been pushed back yet again, to 2024. And the problems at Flamanville are not unique. Finland’s newest nuclear power plant, which started operating last month, was supposed to be completed in 2009. As President Vladimir V. Putin’s war in Ukraine pushes Europe to sever its dependence on Russian natural gas and oil, nuclear power’s profile is rising, promising homegrown energy as well as reliable electricity. Nuclear energy could help solve Europe’s looming power crunch, advocates say, complementing a major pivot that was already underway before the war to adopt solar, wind power and other renewable technologies to meet ambitious climate-change goals. “Putin’s invasion redefined our energy security considerations in Europe,” said Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency. He added, “I would expect that nuclear may well make a step back in Europe and elsewhere as a result of the energy insecurity.” But turning a nuclear revival into a reality is fraught with problems. The dash to find ready alternatives to Russian fuel has magnified a political divide in Europe over nuclear power, as a bloc of pronuclear countries led by France, Europe’s biggest atomic producer, pushes for a buildup while Germany and other like-minded countries oppose it, citing the dangers of radioactive waste. A recent European Commission plan for reducing dependence on Russia pointedly left nuclear power off a list of energy sources to be considered.

Pool photo by Finnbarr Webster The long delays and cost overruns that have dogged the huge Flamanville-3 project, a state of the art pressurized-water reactor designed to produce 1,600 megawatts of energy, are emblematic of wider technical, logistical and cost challenges facing an expansion. A quarter of all electricity in the European Union comes from nuclear power produced in a dozen countries from an aging fleet that was mostly built in the 1980s. France, with 56 reactors, produces more than half the total. A fleet of up to 13 new-generation nuclear reactors planned in France, using a different design from the one in Flamanville, wouldn’t be ready until at least 2035 — too late to make a difference in the current energy crunch. Across the channel, Britain recently announced ambitions for as many as eight new nuclear plants, but the reality is more sobering. Five of the six existing British reactors are expected to be retired within a decade because of age, while only one new nuclear station, a long-delayed, French-led giant costing 20 billion pounds at Hinkley Point in southwest England, is under construction. Its first part is expected to come online in 2026. Others being considered in Eastern Europe aren’t expected to come online before 2030. “Nuclear is going to take so long” because the projects require at least 10 years for completion, said Jonathan Stern, a senior research fellow at the independent Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. “The big problem is getting off Russian gas, and that problem is now — not in a decade, when maybe we’ve built another generation of nuclear reactors,” he added. Advocates say nuclear power can be a solution if the political will is there. Belgium’s government, in agreement with the country’s Green party, reversed a decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2025 and extended the life of two reactors for another decade as Russia intensified its assault on Ukraine last month. The energy will help Belgium avoid relying on Russian gas as it builds out renewable power sources, including wind turbines and solar fields, to meet European climate goals by 2035.

Gianfranco Tripodo for The New York Times “The invasion of Ukraine was a life changer,” Belgium’s energy minister, Tinne Van der Straeten, said last week, explaining the government’s U-turn. “We wanted to reduce our imports from Russia.” But in Germany, which is more dependent than any other European country on Russian gas and coal, the idea of using nuclear power to bridge an energy crunch appears to be going nowhere. Germany is scheduled to close its last three nuclear plants by the end of the year, the final chapter in a program that lawmakers approved to phase out the country’s fleet of 17 reactors after the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, in 2011. Two of Germany’s largest energy companies said they were open to postponing the shutdown to help ease the nation’s reliance on Russia. But the Green party, part of Berlin’s governing coalition, ruled out continuing to operate them — let alone reopening three nuclear stations that closed in December. “We decided for reasons that I think are very good and right that we want to phase them out,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz told Parliament this month, adding that the idea of delaying Germany’s exit from nuclear power was “not a good plan.” Image The coal-fired Scholven power plant that provides energy for Germany. Credit... Martin Meissner/Associated Press Even in countries that see nuclear power as a valuable option, a host of hurdles lie in the way. “It is not going to happen overnight,” said Mark Hibbs, a nuclear expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a research organization. President Emmanuel Macron’s plans for a nuclear power renaissance in France envision a wave of large and small new-generation atomic reactors at an estimated starting price of €50 billion ($53 billion) — a staggering cost that other European countries can’t or won’t take on. Buildup won’t be fast, he acknowledged, in part because the industry also needs to train a new generation of nuclear power engineers. “Most governments push and push, and even if they start building it takes a long time,” Mr. Stern of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said. “All these other technologies are advancing rapidly and they’re all getting cheaper, while nuclear isn’t advancing and it’s getting more expensive.” In the meantime, many of France’s aging reactors, built to forge energy independence after the 1970s oil crisis, have been paused for safety inspections, making it difficult for French nuclear power to help bridge a Russian energy squeeze, said Anne-Sophie Corbeau of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. “Nuclear production will decrease in France this year unless you find a magic solution, but there is no magic solution,” she said. Still, Moscow’s aggression may help reverse what had been an arc of the industry’s gradual decline. Recently there has been a string of upbeat declarations. Besides Britain’s announcement this month to expand its nuclear capacity, the Netherlands, with one reactor, plans to build two more to supplement solar, wind and geothermal energy. And in Eastern Europe, a number of countries in Russia’s shadow had been making plans to build fleets of nuclear reactors — a move that advocates say appears prescient in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. NuScale Power, an Oregon company selling a new reactor design that it claims will be cheaper and quicker to build because key components will be assembled in factories, has signed preliminary deals in Romania and Poland. Russia’s invasion has reinforced customers’ “desire to consider nuclear being part of the overall energy mix for their portfolios,” said Tom Mundy, the company’s chief commercial officer. Nuclearelectrica, the Romanian power company, is pushing ahead with both a NuScale plant and two Canadian reactors, to accompany a pair of nuclear facilities that generate about 20 percent of the country’s electricity, said Cosmin Ghita, the chief executive. “The Ukraine crisis has definitely shown us the need to bolster energy security,” Mr. Ghita said. “We are gaining more traction for our projects.” Meike Becker, a utilities analyst at Bernstein, a research firm, said that over the long term, Russia’s war was likely to “help the European idea” of being more energy independent. “That is something that nuclear can deliver,” she added.

Credit... Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters All three nuclear power plants under Ukrainian control are back online and will soon be producing energy at normal capacity, the head of the national energy utility said on Friday, two days after Russian missile strikes that forced utility crews to scramble to stabilize the country’s crippled energy grid and raised further concerns about the nuclear perils of the war. Ukraine typically relies on nuclear power for more than half of its energy, an uncommonly high rate of dependence. The Russian attacks on Wednesday triggered emergency protections at the three plants and required a halt to production. “Now the energy system is fully integrated; all regions are connected,” said Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the chief executive officer of Ukrenergo, the national utility. He added that utility crews are prepared to react to further Russian attacks, but urged consumers to save electricity. On Friday morning, electricity had been restored to meet about 70 percent of the country’s needs but rolling blackouts remained in place, Ukrenergo said in a statement posted on the Telegram messaging app. “Priority was given to critical infrastructure facilities in all regions,” the statement said, adding that efforts to reconnect household consumers were ongoing in “sub-zero” temperatures. The city government in Kyiv, the capital, said on Friday morning that water had been fully restored but that half of the city’s housing stock was still in emergency power outage mode. Without electricity, taps run dry, water purification becomes unreliable, and wastewater is either not collected or has to be disposed of untreated. Wednesday marked the first time in the 40-year history of the country’s nuclear power industry that all operating nuclear facilities were shut down and had to rely on emergency diesel generators, officials said. For months, attacks in and around the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have left engineers racing from one crisis to the next as it has repeatedly been disconnected from the national energy grid. External power was restored on Thursday morning at the plant a day after it was lost, according to the United Nation’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has had inspectors at the facility since early September. That plant, Europe’s largest, has been offline since September but still needs electricity to keep cooling equipment running around the clock and ward off a nuclear meltdown. “The complete and simultaneous loss of off-site power for Ukraine’s nuclear power plants shows that the situation for nuclear safety and security in the country is become increasingly precarious, challenging and potentially dangerous,” Rafael Grossi, the U.N. agency’s director general, said on Thursday. “This would have been completely unimaginable before this tragic war. It is extremely concerning.” The agency has started providing assistance at Ukraine’s other nuclear power plants after it was requested by Kyiv, Mr. Grossi said. “We must do everything to prevent a nuclear accident at any of these facilities, which would only add to the terrible suffering we are already witnessing in Ukraine,” he said. Snow and freezing rain worsened the plight of millions of Ukrainians who were without power on Thursday evening. “Energy workers, utility workers, business — everyone is doing their part to give light again,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in his nightly address. “This is truly a nationwide task — Ukraine is working as unitedly as possible in this.”",2022-11-25T16:10:24.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire
dc5f623d-4143-43c5-9c97-c91b47b3b974,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/23/world/europe/23nukes.html,Italy Plans to Resume Building Atomic Plants,"ROME  Italy announced Thursday that within five years it planned to resume building nuclear energy plants, two decades after a public referendum resoundingly banned nuclear power and deactivated all its reactors. “By the end of this legislature, we will put down the foundation stone for the construction in our country of a group of new-generation nuclear plants,” said Claudio Scajola, minister of economic development. “An action plan to go back to nuclear power cannot be delayed anymore.” The change is a striking sign of the times, reflecting growing concern in many European countries over the skyrocketing price of oil and energy security, and the warming effects of carbon emissions from fossil fuels. All have combined to make this once-scorned form of energy far more palatable. “Italy has had the most dramatic, the most public turnaround, but the sentiments against nuclear are reversing very quickly all across Europe  Holland, Belgium, Sweden, Germany and more,” said Ian Hore-Lacey, spokesman for the World Nuclear Association, an industry group based in London. The rehabilitation of nuclear power was underscored in January when John Hutton, the British business secretary, grouped it with “other low-carbon sources of energy” like biofuels. It was barely mentioned in the government action plan on energy three years earlier. Echoing the sentiment on Thursday, Mr. Scajola said, “Only nuclear plants safely produce energy on a vast scale with competitive costs, respecting the environment.” A number of European countries have banned or restricted nuclear power in the past 20 years, including Italy, which closed all its plants. Germany and Belgium have long prohibited the building of reactors, although existing ones were allowed to run their natural lifespan. France was one of the few countries that continued to rely heavily on nuclear power. Environmental groups in Italy immediately attacked any plan to bring back nuclear power. Giuseppe Onufrio, a director of Greenpeace Italy, called the announcement “a declaration of war.” Emma Bonino, an opposition politician and vice president of the Italian Senate, said building nuclear plants made no economic sense because they would not be ready for at least 20 years. “We should be investing more in solar and wind,” she said. “We should be moving much more quickly to improve energy efficiency, of buildings, for example. That’s something Italy has never done anything with.” But conditions were very different in the 1980s, when European countries turned away from nuclear power. Oil cost less than $50 a barrel, global warming was a fringe science and climate change had not been linked to manmade emissions. Perhaps more important for the public psyche, almost all of Europe’s nuclear bans and restrictions were enacted after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union in which radioactivity was released into the environment. The equation has changed. Today, with oil approaching $150 a barrel, most European countries, which generally have no oil and gas resources, have been forced by finances to consider new forms of energy  and fast. New nuclear plants take 20 years to build. Also, Europeans watched in horror in 2006 as President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia cut off the natural gas supply to Ukraine in a price dispute, leaving it in darkness. New green technologies, like solar power, wind and biofuel, cannot yet form the backbone of a country’s energy strategy, and it is not clear that they will ever achieve that level. Italy is the largest net energy importer in Europe, but nearly all European countries rely heavily on imported energy  particularly oil and gas. Enel, Italy’s leading energy provider, announced this year that it would close its oil-fired power plants because the fuel had become unaffordable. Italians pay the highest energy prices in Europe. Enel has been building coal plants to fill the void left by oil. Coal plants are cheaper but create relatively high levels of carbon emissions, even using the type of new “clean coal” technology Enel had planned. A few European countries, like Germany and Poland, could likewise fall back on their abundant coal reserves if they rejected oil and gas  but most of the coal mined in each country is of low grade and pollutes highly. After the government announcement opening Italy to nuclear power, Enel’s managing director, Fulvio Conti, said, “We are ready.” But he added that “new regulation and strong agreement on the plan within the country” would be needed. Enel, which operates power plants in several European countries, already has at least one nuclear plant, in Bulgaria, and has been researching so-called fourth-generation nuclear reactors, which are intended to be safer and to minimize waste and the use of natural resources. Italy’s old reactors still exist, but are too outdated to be reopened. New ones would have to be built. The Italian government laid out few specifics to back its announcement and officials at the Ministry of Economic Development said they were still studying issues like exactly what kind of plants could be built, and whether a new referendum would be required to re-open Italy to nuclear power. Marzia Marzioli, who leads a citizens’ campaign against new coal plants in Italy, said nuclear was equally repellent. “As with coal, nuclear energy is the exact opposite of what we would like for Italy.” “It is a choice that doesn’t consider the alternatives,” such as solar power, she said. To build nuclear plants, Italy would almost certainly have to improve its system of dealing with nuclear waste. The plants that were shut down years ago still store 235 tons of nuclear fuel.",2008-05-23T08:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-europe

To the Editor: Imagine how different the electricity situation in California would be if the state had not forced the closing of the Rancho Seco nuclear plant (''Hard Questions on Nuclear Power,'' editorial, May 29). Nuclear power has already proved its worth to this country through the 20 percent share of electricity it supplies. The question of whether to build new plants is not if, but when. A role for nuclear power is inevitable given the inherent problems of fossil fuels and the inability of alternatives to come close to being economical.

That’s because the nuclear industry has long been hobbled by two problems that its boosters can’t really wish away: Nuclear is far slower to build than most other forms of power, and it’s far more expensive, too. And now there is a third problem on the horizon. As battery technology improves and the price of electricity storage plummets, nuclear may be way too late, too — with much of its value eclipsed by cheaper, faster and more flexible renewable power technologies. In order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels — the goal set in the Paris Agreement to avert the worst effects of global warming — experts say that we need to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions to a net of zero by 2050. Responding to such a climate emergency with nuclear power is like calling on a sloth to put out a house fire. The 63 nuclear reactors that went into service around the world between 2011 and 2020 took an average of around 10 years to build. By comparison, solar and wind farms can be built in months; in 2020 and 2021 alone, the world added 464 gigawatts of wind and solar power-generation capacity, which is more power than can be generated by all the nuclear plants operating in the world today. The nuclear industry has been notorious for cost overruns and delays. The only nuclear reactors under construction in the United States — a Westinghouse project at the Plant Vogtle power station in Georgia — were started in 2013 and projected to be finished in 2017. They are still not done — and an initial budget of $14 billion has more than doubled to over $28 billion. In 2017, utilities in South Carolina canceled two reactors midway through construction after cost projections ballooned from $11.5 billion to more than $25 billion. And after all this build time, you get a very expensive source of energy. In a common energy-industry measure known as “levelized cost,” nuclear’s minimum price is about $131 per megawatt-hour, which is at least twice the price of natural gas and coal, and four times the cost of utility-scale solar and onshore wind power installations. And the high price of nuclear power doesn’t include its extraneous costs, such as the staggering price of disasters. Cleanup and other costs for the 2011 Fukushima disaster, caused by an earthquake and a tsunami off the Japanese coast, may approach a trillion dollars.",2022-09-16T11:00:17.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

In France, government ministers agreed in an emergency session this morning to allow Électricité de France, the national utility and operator of the country's 56 nuclear power plants, to temporarily raise the maximum temperature of the cooling water that its plants pump into French rivers. The utility said in a statement that not only nuclear plants, but also those driven by coal and water power, were being affected. The utility said the heat wave ''deeply affects the coal, fuel, nuclear power output and hydropower production.'' Électricité de France, which generates about 90 percent of French power, said it had already shut down a coal-fired plant at Vitry, outside Paris. In Germany, two states agreed to lift the permitted temperature limits. In Baden-Württemberg, in the southwest, the maximum allowed temperature of water from the state's two nuclear-driven plants was lifted to 30 degrees Celsius, about 86 degrees Fahrenheit, from 28. Bavaria, in the southeast, lifted the limit to 27 degrees Celsius, from 25, but limited the exemption to one month. French and German nuclear reactors are located along riverbanks to ensure sufficient supplies of cooling water. Governments generally impose limits on the temperatures of water that is poured back into rivers after cooling reactors to protect the environment and river life. The measures appeared certain to reinforce antinuclear arguments in France, where nuclear energy accounts for roughly 75 percent of energy generated. Nuclear energy has kept French electricity rates among Europe's lowest and has therefore been relatively well accepted. In Germany, where nuclear energy accounts for about a third of energy generated, the cabinet of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, consisting of Social Democrats and Greens, agreed three years ago to phase out the country's 19 nuclear power plants. But the complex agreement limits the life of existing reactors to an average of 32 years, meaning that nuclear energy will not be entirely eliminated for many years, if ever. In recent weeks, as temperatures in Europe reached record levels, demand has soared for electricity to run air conditioners and other cooling systems. By last month, temperatures at some Électricité de France reactors had reached such high levels that the utility began experimenting with temporary sprinkling systems, dousing the exterior shells of several reactors and earning harsh criticism for applying do-it-yourself methods to the problem. Roselyne Bachelot, the French environment minister, said the release granted to the energy industry would be limited in duration, though she did not elaborate. At a news conference, she said, ''You cannot fail to envisage cuts in power because, given the general situation in Europe, we don't have a spare tire.'' Environmentalists and opponents of nuclear energy attacked the French decision. An umbrella organization of French groups opposed to nuclear power, Get Out Of Nuclear, assailed what it called ''scandalous dispensations'' to the energy industry ''with the sole objective of protecting nuclear energy.'' Greenpeace said in a statement that the situation ''does nothing if not reveal the fragility of the French power system based almost entirely on nuclear energy.''",2003-08-12T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world
604d5ba1-1096-4573-a1c7-600ccb31fa4d,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/10/us/politics/10nuclear.html,"2 Endorsements of Nuclear Power, but Sharp Differences on Details","Contrary to what Democrats may think, there is more to John McCain’s energy program than “drill, baby, drill.” And contrary to what Mr. McCain has been saying on the campaign trail, where he proposes the construction of 45 nuclear plants by 2030, Barack Obama does not “oppose the use of nuclear power.” Both men endorse nuclear energy, although to differing degrees, as part of their strategy to wean the United States from its dependence on foreign oil. While Mr. McCain includes the building of nuclear reactors among his preferred options to obtain more energy, Mr. Obama assigns a higher priority to developing renewable sources like solar, wind and bio-fuels and increasing efficiency in the consumption of existing sources. “I think that nuclear power should be in the mix when it comes to energy,” Mr. Obama said in June in Jacksonville, Fla., but added, “I don’t think it’s our optimal energy source, because we haven’t figured out how to store the waste safely or recycle the waste.” Mr. McCain says on his campaign Web site that “nuclear power is a proven, zero-emission source of energy, and it is time we recommit” to expanding its use. He also argues that it is “critical that the U.S. be able to build the components for these plants and reactors within our own country so that we are not dependent on foreign suppliers with long wait times.” Because nuclear energy is virtually carbon neutral, some environmentalists who opposed its use now are more open to it. Elgie Holstein, an adviser to Mr. Obama on energy issues, accused the McCain campaign of misrepresenting Mr. Obama’s position on nuclear power. “Some specific proposals that Senator McCain has made are troubling,” Mr. Holstein said, because of the problems of storage and reprocessing, and the issue of non-proliferation of nuclear fuel. “Senator Obama definitely understands that nuclear power plays a major role in our electricity mix and will continue to do so into the foreseeable future,” Mr. Holstein, a former Energy Department official said. “He doesn’t favor shutting down power plants and hasn’t come out against extending their licenses, so it is simply incorrect to say he is anti-nuclear-power.” It is probably safe to say that Democrats as a group are less enthusiastic than Republicans about nuclear energy. The 57-page platform adopted at the Democrats’ convention in Denver in August does not mention nuclear power. Mr. Obama is from Illinois, which has more nuclear reactors than any other state, and during the Democratic primary season drew fire from rivals for donations he had received from the company that operates those reactors. In his acceptance speech in Denver, Mr. Obama vowed that as president he would “find ways to safely harness nuclear power.” Mr. McCain restated his support for nuclear power in the first two presidential debates, and criticized Mr. Obama. Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for the McCain campaign, did not respond to phone calls and e-mail messages over a one-month period requesting an interview with one of Mr. McCain’s energy advisers to elaborate on Mr. McCain’s stance. On the campaign trail, Mr. McCain has repeatedly cited France as a model for the development of nuclear power in the United States. In France, 59 nuclear power plants generate nearly 80 percent of the country’s electricity, helping to reduce carbon emissions and producing a surplus that has made France one of the largest net electricity exporters in the world. In France, the government controls both the construction of nuclear power plants and the generation and distribution of electricity. “Putting aside the question of whether it is advisable to have an electricity system dominated by one mode of generation, it is a little odd for him to point to the heavily subsidized French case and say we should be emulating it,” Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said of Mr. McCain. “It would take a massive shift in government policy to proceed in the French direction, and it would be antithetical to the United States and how it operates, since it would be a quasi-socialist system.” In campaign speeches, Mr. McCain also estimates that his program to build nuclear reactors would “provide 700,000 jobs for American workers.” Some nuclear power experts offer more modest figures, noting that much of the heavy foundry work and other tasks would have to be done overseas, at least in the initial phase. But Mr. McCain has said he wants such work to be done within the United States, even though he noted in July in Missouri that “our manufacturing base to even construct these plants is almost gone,” and added, “We will need to recover all the knowledge and skills that have been lost over three stagnant decades in a highly technical field.” Patrick Moore, a founder of Greenpeace and the co-chairman of the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition, a pro-nuclear group, estimated that each reactor would cost up to $8 billion and would generate 3,000 to 4,000 jobs during the construction phase and up to 800 permanent jobs once in operation. Asked to provide a ballpark figure on employment if all 45 reactors were to be built, Mr. Moore, responded, “225,000 good union jobs that you can support a family on.” Trade groups like the Nuclear Energy Institute favor plans similar to Mr. McCain’s proposal to build 45 nuclear reactors, but some energy experts say that would require billions of dollars in new subsidies and be an inefficient use of taxpayers’ money, no matter how many jobs were generated. Those experts seem to prefer Mr. Obama’s promise to invest $150 billion in clean-energy projects over 10 years, the bulk of which would probably be directed toward non-nuclear energy sources. “The two big hurdles to the construction of nuclear plants in the United States are that they are not economically competitive and cannot be privately financed, so the real issue McCain should be addressing is how he proposes to pay for them,” said Tom Cochran, a physicist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. “You’re simply penalizing the programs and technology that include improvements in energy efficiency and can provide climate mitigation more quickly, cheaply and safely.” Mr. McCain has sought to defuse concerns about the safety of reactors by noting his own service aboard the first nuclear powered aircraft carrier, the Enterprise. During the more than 50 years that the United States Navy has deployed nuclear vessels, “there has never been an accident,” he said recently in a campaign swing through Florida. Strictly speaking, that statement is not correct. While it is true there has never been a known fatal accident involving nuclear material aboard a naval vessel, vessels have suffered blowback from radioactive waste or leaked radioactive coolant water in domestic waters and foreign ports, which generated complaints from governments in Japan and Singapore. In large part because of safety concerns, the two candidates disagree on whether the federal government should build a nuclear storage facility at Yucca Mountain, Nev., about 90 miles north of Las Vegas. Mr. McCain favors the proposal. Mr. Obama opposes it, arguing that a better short-term solution is to continue to store nuclear waste at the reactors that produce it “until we find a safe, long-term disposal solution that is based on sound science.”",2008-10-10T06:45:04.000+02:00,NYTIMES,national-u.s.-politics

''To put it bluntly, it was extremely thin,'' Shoichi Nakagawa, Japan's minister of the economy, trade and industry, said Tuesday after touring the power plant, in Mihama, about 200 miles west of here. ''It looked terrible, even in the layman's view.'' Although the carbon steel pipe carried 300-degree steam at high pressure, it had not been inspected since the power plant opened in 1976. In April 2003, Nihon Arm, a maintenance subcontractor, informed the Kansai Electric Power Company, the plant owner, that there could be a problem. Last November, the power company scheduled an ultrasound inspection for Saturday. ''We thought we could postpone the checks until this month,'' Akira Kokado, the deputy plant manager, told reporters at Mihama. ''We had never expected such rapid corrosion.'' But on Monday, four days before the scheduled shutdown for the inspection, superheated steam blew a two-foot-wide hole in the pipe, scalding four workmen to death and injuring five others seriously. The steam that escaped was not in contact with the nuclear reactor, and no nuclear contamination has been reported. Initial measurements showed that the steam had corroded the affected section of pipe from its original thickness of 0.4 inches to 0.06 inches, less than one-third the minimum safety standard. Kansai Electric said in a statement that the pipe ''showed large-scale corrosion.'' ''We conducted visual inspections but never made ultrasonic tests, which can measure the thickness of a steel pipe,'' said Haruo Nakano, a Kansai Electric spokesman. In response, Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency ordered ultrasound inspections at four other power companies that own nuclear plants with the same type of pressurized water reactors. The inspections will involve nearly half of Japan's 52 nuclear power plants. The Kyodo news agency reported Wednesday that corrosion problems had prompted operators in recent years to replace the steam pipes at 16 plants of a design similar to that of the plant at Mihama. With television news helicopters swarming over the Mihama plant on Monday, government officials were quick to promise that a full investigation would take place. ''We must put all our effort into determining the cause of the accident and to ensuring safety,'' Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said Tuesday. He added that the government would respond ''resolutely, after confirming the facts.'' On Tuesday, the police opened an investigation to determine why 221 workers were in the reactor facility at the time of the accident. The subcontractor has said they were moving in equipment and testing materials in preparation for a shutdown on Friday and subsequent inspection. Kyodo reported that investigators believed that the company might have neglected safety standards by allowing workers to prepare for an annual inspection while the plant was still running. But government leaders also tried to bolster flagging public support for nuclear power. ''Nuclear power has a significant impact in our lives,'' Mr. Koizumi said Tuesday. ''We have to pay close attention so that our lives won't be affected by this accident.'' Japan planned to build an additional 11 reactors in this decade, increasing the nation's reliance on domestic nuclear power to 40 percent of its electricity needs. Already slowed by local opposition, that program may now be stalled by the accident, the most deadly in the history of nuclear power in Japan. ''In Japan it's virtually impossible to build new nuclear facilities now,'' Asahi Shimbun, a liberal newspaper, said in an editorial on Tuesday. ''But facilities are wearing out, and there are worries about increasing problems with corroding pipes, rupturing valves and the reactor core.'' Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a business daily, worried that the accident could undermine public support in Japan for nuclear power. ''We must find the cause of the accident and urgently come up with measures to prevent such an accident from happening again,'' the newspaper editorialized. ''This accident seriously damaged public confidence in nuclear safety.'' Yomiuri Shimbun, a conservative newspaper, warned, ''Care must be taken not to overemphasize the dangers involved in the operation of nuclear power stations, which could lead to an overreaction.'' Japan has the world's third-largest nuclear power industry, after the United States and France. Mainichi Shimbun, a liberal newspaper, said further expansion of nuclear power in Japan was now in play. It said in an editorial, ''As we investigate the cause of the accident, the outcome could determine the course of Japan's nuclear energy policy.''",2004-08-11T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

The footage was released by the Energoatom State Company. Credit Credit... Energoatom State Company KYIV, Ukraine — A powerful Russian missile exploded less than 900 feet from the reactors at the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant just after midnight on Monday, Ukrainian officials said, narrowly avoiding a possible nuclear calamity and underscoring the threat posed by the Kremlin’s assaults on critical infrastructure across Ukraine. There was no damage to essential safety equipment at the nuclear power plant, which remained fully operational, Ukraine’s national nuclear energy company, Energoatom, said. No casualties were immediately reported. But the explosion caused extensive damage around a hydroelectric power station in the industrial zone that surrounds the nuclear complex. It forced the shutdown of one of the plant’s hydraulic units and caused partial power outages in the area. Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, told Ukrainian national television that while the heavily fortified concrete buildings that house nuclear reactors are built to withstand a plane crash, the blast from Monday’s strike was powerful enough to have damaged the containment structures had the missile struck closer. “There is no other way to characterize this except for nuclear terrorism,” he said. The extent of the damage was still being investigated, officials said, as was the type of missile used. Preliminary information pointed to an Iskander cruise missile, Ukraine’s southern military command said in a statement. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the Ukrainian president’s office, said in a statement that the strike had caused a brief disconnection of three power lines at the nuclear plant but that they were automatically reconnected. All of the plant’s reactors were now operating normally, he added, but warned: “A few hundred meters and we would have woken up in a completely different reality.” The South Ukraine plant, Ukraine’s second-largest functioning nuclear power station, is some 300 miles west of the larger Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is occupied by Russian forces and has come under repeated shelling. Energoatom said on Monday that “the Russian army launched a missile attack on the industrial zone of the South Ukrainian nuclear power plant” at 12:20 a.m., causing “a powerful explosion” whose shock wave blew out more than 100 windows at the nuclear plant. The company released security camera footage that showed a massive fireball lighting up the night sky over the site. The nuclear plant, near the city of Yuzhnoukrainsk in the Mykolaiv region, is part of the South Ukrainian Energy Complex, which includes the hydroelectric plant and one other power station. It lies more than 100 miles north of the city of Mykolaiv and far from any frontline fighting. Anastasia Kuznietsova contributed reporting.",2022-09-19T18:08:39.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

I believe Mr. Reagan does not make pronouncements lightly without backup: witness his statements and action on ''Star Wars'' and on tax increases. Does he have a plan to reduce nuclear weapons? I would like to know what he would do with the weapons material we have produced over the last 40 years. One must remember that plutonium, which is the major weapons material, has a half-life of 24,000 years, which means that it would take a quarter of a million years to dispose of plutonium by decay only. This is not realistic; the only way to get rid of plutonium is to use it to make fuel for civilian nuclear-power reactors. Positive verification for disposal of plutonium could be achieved if each country agreed to sell and deliver equal quantities of material to civilian power producers. The International Atomic Energy Agency could monitor this activity. With the quantity of plutonium in weapons today, it would take decades to burn up the weapons material in reactors in the United States, the Soviet Union and other nuclear-power countries. We must, therefore, look upon the world's nuclear-power plants as a means for disposing of nuclear weapons rather than as bomb-producing factories, as some anti-nukes view nuclear-power plants.

The Air Force is exploring the possibility of building several hundred small nuclear reactors that would generate electrical power in a protracted nuclear war, according to Air Force, Department of Energy, Congressional and industry officials. The reactors, which would be transported by air around the country and overseas, would produce emergency electrical power for computers, communication lines, weapon launching sites, support equipment and repair shops, the officials said. They would be used if the commercial power grid on which the Air Force relies were destroyed by nuclear attack. The officials estimated that the plan would take five years to execute and would cost about $20 billion. The Department of Defense has requested $5.5 million for the project in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. That money would be for partial payment of an $11.9 million contract being negotiated between the Government and Westinghouse. Six Companies Sought Role Six companies in the nuclear industry submitted design concepts, and Westinghouse was selected to submit a detailed design for reactors that could produce 10 megawatts, according to Gary S. Flora, the Air Force's Associate Director of Engineering and Services. The dimensions and weight of the reactors and the nature of containers and other safety devices for transporting them have not yet been decided. If the program goes into production, the Air Force and Department of Energy would probably place the first orders in the United States in more than 10 years for nuclear power plants. Politically, the project, which officials said the Air Force had tried to keep out of the public eye, seems likely to provoke dispute as it proceeds. Vital to Administration Strategy On one side, the officials said, the project is vital to the Reagan Administration's strategy for fighting a nuclear war and to the Air Force, which is charged with developing most of the weapons and supporting structure to fight such wars. The nuclear industry that would produce the reactors deemed likely to support the project. On the other side would most likely be antiwar groups, environmentalists who oppose nuclear power and a variety of people who would say the plan will add to the Federal deficit. Much of the debate will probably go on in the Congress, which must approve all funds for research, development and production of the nuclear reactors. Reliance on Commercial Grids Today, the Air Force depends largely on commercial power grids for electricity to operate everything from gyroscopes aboard ballistic missiles standing ready in silos to support facilities for bombers armed with nuclear bombs or cruise missiles. Air Force officials have testified before Congress that daily power requirements for bases today range from 5 to 60 megawatts during peak demand and cost $900 million last year. The officials have estimated that wartime demands would be double that requirement. The electric power grids are highly vulnerable to attack, sabotage and terrorism, Air Force officials said. Only small diesel generators and batteries would be available in emergencies, and many of those would be as vulnerable as the commercial power supply. The generators, moreover, would require oil or gasoline, supplies which are certain to be disrupted during a nuclear war. New Sources Must Be Sought Thus, the officials said, the Air Force is seeking sources of electricity that could be protected from repeated nuclear attacks and could continue to provide power to command posts, communications apparatus and weapons as American nuclear forces kept firing. The Reagan Administration's doctrine for protracted nuclear war has called for the deployment of the MX intercontinental missile; the Trident 2 submarine-launched missile; the B-1 bomber and the Stealth bomber, the latter designed to evade detection by radar, and a variety of cruise missiles. Administration officials have said survival of communications would be the critical element in a nuclear conflict. The President, his senior aides and military commanders must be able to get information relayed from space and around the world, and to transmit orders to dispersed forces. After a survey of bases, Mr. Flora told a House subcommittee 11 days ago that ''the key components of our energy supply and distribution systems are vulnerable to accident, natural disaster, terrorism, sabotage, war and economic actions.'' Each Could Cost $75 Million Mr. Flora told the Science and Technology Committee's Subcommittee on Energy Research and Production: ''The Department of Energy recommended small nuclear reactors as one viable option which could satisfy our needs and proposed to assist us in the evaluation of this potential.'' Congressional officials informed about the program said each nuclear reactor would cost between $65 million and $75 million to build when the line is at full production. Thus, 300 such reactors could cost about $20 billion. Underground concrete and steel shelters would be designed to protect the reactors.",1987-03-30T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

They’ve revived that classic debate: the hard path versus the soft path. The soft path, as Amory Lovins defined it in the 1970s, is energy conservation and power from the sun, wind and plants — the technologies that Senator Barack Obama emphasizes in his plan to reduce greenhouse emissions. Senator John McCain is more enthusiastic about building nuclear power plants, the quintessential hard path. As a rule, it’s not a good idea to revive anything from the 1970s. But this debate is the exception, and not just because the threat of global warming has raised the stakes. The old lessons are as good a guide as any to the future, as William Tucker argues in “ Terrestrial Energy ,” his history of the hard-soft debate. The initial debate over nuclear power seemed to end not long after the partial meltdown in 1979 of the reactor at Three Mile Island. Utilities canceled orders and stopped building reactors, partly because of public fears, but perhaps mainly because of rising costs. Mr. Lovins and his allies liked to say that nuclear power, once promoted as “too cheap to meter,” had now become “too expensive to matter.” The soft path seemed to be the way to go, particularly when some of Mr. Lovins’s predictions about energy conservation came true. As Americans cut back in response to higher prices and new incentives, the growth in electricity demand slowed. Some public officials, most enthusiastically in California, told utilities to stop building large power plants. Instead, they subsidized wind farms and solar power, which were supposed to be cheap and plentiful alternatives once the technologies matured. Instead, they remained so costly and scarce that Californians’ electricity rates were among the highest in America. They endured rolling blackouts in 2000 while paying astronomical prices for power from nuclear and fossil-fuel plants in other states. The crisis was attributed to price controls and Enron’s market manipulation, but the underlying problem was a shortage of power that forced the state to start building old-fashioned fossil-fuel plants for itself. Meanwhile, there was a surprise on the hard path, too. Once utilities stopped building reactors, the share of electricity from nuclear power was projected to decline steadily as the oldest reactors were retired. But then several new “merchant energy” companies began assembling fleets of reactors sold off by local utilities. The new owners standardized operations, retrained workers and brought in human-factor engineers to redesign the famously indecipherable control panels. Under the old owners, the reactors were balky white elephants operating only 60 percent of the time. By improving maintenance and preventing mistakes, the new owners kept them running 90 percent of the time and won permission to upgrade their capacities. So even as the nuclear industry was shrinking in the last two decades as the oldest reactors shut down, the remaining ones were profitably generating an increasing share of the country’s electricity. Today about 20 percent of electricity in America is generated by nuclear power, which is about 20 times the contribution from solar and wind power. Nuclear power also costs less, according to Gilbert Metcalf , an economist at Tufts University. After estimating the costs and factoring out the hefty tax breaks for different forms of low-carbon energy, he estimates that new nuclear plants could produce electricity more cheaply than windmills, solar power or “clean coal” plants. The outlook could change, of course, if new nuclear plants turn out to be more expensive than expected, or if engineers make breakthroughs in other technologies. (To debate these possibilities, go to www.nytimes.com/tierneylab.) Given the uncertainties, Dr. Metcalf cautions, it would be risky to bet everything on nuclear power as the answer to global warming. But it seems even riskier to bet on just the soft path, as so many greens are doing, either by flatly opposing nuclear power or by setting so many conditions that no plants could be built for decades, if ever. (Mr. Obama says nuclear power is necessary but should not be expanded until security and safety issues are addressed.) “The nuclear debate is still stuck back in the 1980s,” says Mr. Tucker, the author of “Terrestrial Energy,” the new brand he’s trying to affix to nuclear power. If people started associating nuclear plants with natural radioactive processes in the Earth instead of atomic bombs, he says, they might be persuaded that it’s the most environmentally benign form of energy, particularly compared with wind farms that cover scenic ridges and the vast solar arrays proposed for “empty” land in deserts. Mr. Tucker, a journalist who has been debunking environmental alarms for decades, says he has come around to Al Gore’s view on the danger of global warming, and he’d like environmentalists to rethink their views, too. “Even when greens give grudging support to nuclear power,” he says, “they add the caveat, ‘But first we have to make sure the plants are absolutely safe’ — as if reactors haven’t been operating safely for 25 years. Nobody recognizes the complete overhaul that has occurred in the industry or how it’s now pumping out twice as much electricity from the same plants with a vastly improved safety record.” By scaring people about the tiny levels of radiation emitted during the normal operation of a nuclear plant, Mr. Tucker says, greens have effectively encouraged the construction of coal plants that actually release more radiation because of the traces of uranium in coal dust. He argues that the risks of terrorist attacks and nuclear waste have been exaggerated, particularly by the environmentalists who objected when the Yucca Mountain nuclear-waste depository was being designed to guarantee a level of safety for only 10,000 years. They successfully sued to enforce a safety standard extending one million years — which, in an ideal world, would be a very nice standard. But if you believe global warming is a planetary crisis that must be addressed immediately, should you really be obsessing about hypothetical dangers near one mountain in A.D. 1,000,000? If there’s already a proven technology that doesn’t spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, why fiddle while coal burns?",2008-10-07T05:30:07.000+02:00,NYTIMES,science-science

Instead, power companies, in their greed, focused on profits. What could the power companies have been thinking when they built reactors on geologically active faults both in Japan and California? Although reactors need to be near a large body of water for cooling purposes, there are many such locations without active faults. Nuclear power can be a safe source of power, without carbon emissions, if we would only spend the money to make it safe. Since many countries have reactors, it makes sense to form a nuclear reactor consortium, financed by those countries with nuclear power, to do research on how to build safe reactors and how to dispose of nuclear waste. Too much time has already been spent on dealing with accidents that could have been avoided if we had the proper knowledge, and we are continually frustrated by the lack of a solution for waste disposal. Robert Ackerberg Massapequa, N.Y., March 22, 2011  To the Editor: Contrary to what Frank N. von Hippel writes in “ It Could Happen Here ” (Op-Ed, March 24), America’s nuclear power plants are well equipped to handle the impacts of severe events, whatever the cause. In recent years, nuclear plants have maintained safety in the direct path of Hurricanes Katrina and Andrew. Nonetheless, our industry is taking steps to make nuclear energy facilities even safer. Companies are verifying each power station’s capability to withstand conditions that result from severe events, including the loss of significant operational and safety systems. They are also verifying that the capability to maintain safety of reactors even in a total loss of electric power is proper and functional. The global nuclear industry is providing technical assistance and equipment as Japan continues to restore cooling systems at the Fukushima reactors. Significant changes after Three Mile Island have led to high safety and reliability at 104 reactors in the United States. As utilities do after significant events such as this, we will apply safety and security upgrades as warranted as part of our commitment to generate electricity safely and reliably. Scott Peterson Senior Vice President Nuclear Energy Institute Washington, March 24, 2011  To the Editor: Are we to take seriously Frank N. von Hippel’s argument that the ultimate deaths of a mere 10,000 people as a result of Chernobyl, compared with the tens of thousands of people killed by particulates from coal, suggest that the nuclear industry is “remarkably safe”? Mr. von Hippel’s assertion that running nuclear power plants is “relatively cheap” once construction costs have been paid conveniently ignores the costs of decommissioning, security for the plant post-closure and radioactive waste storage in perpetuity. Advocates for nuclear power who fail to address this staggering legacy of hidden costs are misleading the public. H. James Quigley Jr. Stony Brook, N.Y., March 24, 2011 The writer is a lecturer in the Sustainability Studies Program at Stony Brook University.  To the Editor: The detection of radioactive iodine 131 in Tokyo’s drinking water (“ Anxiety Up as Tokyo Issues Warning on Its Tap Water ,” front page, March 24), in amounts considered unhealthy for children, makes clear that potassium iodide must be administered if children are to be adequately protected against thyroid cancer caused by ingested and inhaled iodine 131. Interdiction of milk supplies, though important, is plainly insufficient. Japan’s apparent preparedness with potassium iodide contrasts with the situation in the United States. In response to 9/11, Congress passed a law to create stockpiles of potassium iodide for populations within a 20-mile radius of nuclear reactors, rather than the 10-mile radius within which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission offers it to states that request it. But the N.R.C., which had opposed the law, fought successfully to keep it from taking effect. In 2008 President George W. Bush’s science adviser, John H. Marburger III, declared that potassium iodide was not needed beyond the 10-mile radius, and that the law therefore would not be implemented. The events in Japan demand that the Obama administration act quickly to reverse this unjustified rejection of a sensible law.

But this is a new era, dominated by fears of tight energy supplies and global warming. Suddenly nuclear power is looking better. The nuclear industry recently trotted out two new leaders of its campaign to encourage the building of new reactors. They are Christie Whitman, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Patrick Moore, a co-founder of Greenpeace. This campaign is the latest sign that nuclear power is getting a more welcome reception from some environmentalists who have moved on to bigger worries. True, most environmental organizations remain adamantly opposed to any expansion of nuclear power and instead look to conservation and renewable energy to get us out of the fossil fuel age. But when the ecologist James Lovelock -- creator of the Gaia hypothesis, which holds that Earth and all its organisms behave as if they were a single living system -- urges his colleagues to drop their ''wrongheaded opposition'' to nuclear energy, it is clear that fissures are developing. There is good reason to give nuclear power a fresh look. It can diversify our sources of energy with a fuel -- uranium -- that is both abundant and inexpensive. More important, nuclear energy can replace fossil-fuel power plants for generating electricity, reducing the carbon dioxide emissions that contribute heavily to global warming. That could be important in large developing economies like China's and India's, which would otherwise rely heavily on burning large quantities of dirty coal and oil. But nuclear power should not be given a free pass in our frantic quest for energy and environmental security. Making any real dent in carbon emissions could require building many hundreds or even thousands of new nuclear plants around the world in coming decades, a hugely ambitious undertaking fraught with challenges. As nuclear expertise and technologies spread around the world, so does the risk that they might be used to make bombs. Unfortunately, the Bush administration erred badly when it signed a nuclear pact with India that would undercut the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the cornerstone of international efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. That misguided deal needs to be repudiated by the Senate. We can only hope that it does not undercut a more promising administration plan to keep the most dangerous fuel-making technologies out of circulation by supplying developing nations with uranium and taking the spent fuel rods back. There remains the unsolved problem of what to do with the radioactive waste generated by nuclear plants. Many people are unwilling to see a resurgence in nuclear power without some assurance that the spent fuel can be handled safely. The Energy Department's repeated setbacks in efforts to open an underground waste repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada do not inspire confidence, but there is no reason why the spent fuel rods can't be stored safely at surface sites for the next 50 to 100 years. More problematic is the administration's long-term solution for waste disposal. It wants to recycle the spent fuel in a new generation of advanced reactors that would use technologies that don't yet exist, following a timetable that many experts think unrealistic. Its current approach is apt to be costly and would leave dangerous plutonium more accessible to terrorists. Nuclear power has a good safety record in this country, and its costs, despite the high initial expense of building the plants, are looking more reasonable now that fossil fuel prices are soaring. How much impact it could really have in slowing carbon emissions has yet to be spelled out, but there is no doubt that nuclear power could serve as a useful bridge to even greener sources of energy.

Credit it for candor. Nuclear energy is a flop, and the power sources of the future will be sun, wind and water. They may be indeed, although the evidence is a shade less compelling than the otherwise intelligent documentary seems to think. It will be seen on Channel 13 at 10 o'clock tonight. At the opening, Meryl Streep, the unseen narrator, describes the energy battle this way: ''The struggle pits the long-established use of limited and potentially hazardous resources against a mix of new technologies that rely on renewable resources like the sun.'' In a struggle like that, of course, we know which side we're supposed to be on. Only a lobbyist would prefer a limited and potentially hazardous resource over old Sol. Who wants acid rain, uppity oil sheiks and other unpleasantnesses? Meanwhile, as Miss Streep notes: ''Nuclear power has been attacked by its critics as unsafe for nearly three decades. Ironically, the nuclear industry has been more crippled in recent years by concerns over costs than over safety.'' This is true. The nuclear power industry has been afflicted by cost overruns, management failures and, its spokesmen insist, burdensome government regulations. At the same time, the nuclear power industry, although it has nothing to do with nuclear weapons, has had to battle cultural and political forces that hold it to be immoral. ''Power Struggle'' shows us representatives of Mothers for Peace and the Abalone Alliance, among others, making their cases. Therefore, it's worth noting, which the documentary barely does, that the rest of the world sees nuclear power differently. France, for example, expects its Government-run nuclear industry to meet 55 percent of the country's electrical energy needs by 1990. And grant that sun, wind and water are attractive possibilities; ''Power Struggle'' is still awfully zealous in its determination to promote them. Thus it gives us a ''renewable-energy advocate'' who says the nuclear energy industry misspent the best part of $125 billion. He may be correct; a cover story in Forbes magazine used that same figure last February. Then, however, he speaks of the industry's ''$75 billion in Federal subsidies.'' All this, he says, led to ''the greatest tragedy in our whole industrial history.'' In fact, the nuclear power industry does not get Federal subsidies, and the $75 billion figure is made of blue smoke. Later we are told that the construction of nuclear plants has been ''70 percent subsidized,'' a figure equally murky. ''Power Struggle'' -a Public Policy Production - seems so fearful the mismanaged nuclear industry will rise from the ashes that it must bury it any way it can. This is unnecessary because ''Power Struggle,'' when it gets down to cases, does have interesting things to say about alternative energy. It shows us, for example, the solar thermal plant of Southern California Edison - 1,800 mirrors in the Mojave Desert that concentrate the sun's rays into a boiler that produces steam. It also shows us Altamont Pass in California, the largest ''wind farm'' in the world. Thousands of windmills are harnessed to produce electricity. Are projects like these the hope of the future? ''Power Struggle'' isn't entirely persuasive, but certainly it's provocative. The examination is worthwhile.",1985-12-17T07:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,cultural-desk-movies

Even before the radioactive dust flung skyward by a burning Soviet reactor has settled, new fears about the safety of nuclear power are being voiced around the world. Students of the nuclear industry said that some countries, especially France and Japan, would probably forge ahead with plans to expand nuclear energy despite the Soviet disaster, both because they believe their technologies to be safe and because they face little serious public opposition. But experts predicted that construction of new nuclear plants would be curtailed elsewhere. In Western Europe, the Soviet disaster has added new kindling to already fiery debates about the future of nuclear power. With the exception of France, the nuclear industry in Western Europe has been stagnating, with little new construction and few orders for future plants. A Slackening of Demand The industry's woes have been attributed to economic factors, including a slackening of projected electrical demand and high interest rates as well as a surge in public concern about safety in the wake of the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island, in Pennsylvania. Now, in the shadow of a far worse accident that has sprinkled several countries with radioactive fallout, Western European opposition to nuclear energy seems certain to widen and deepen, experts believe. ''In Europe outside France, the effect on future reactor orders is going to be paralyzing,'' said Andrew Holmes, editor of European Energy Report, a newsletter published in London. ''This accident will make it far more difficult for new plants to be built,'' said David Albright, a nuclear specialist at the Federation of American Scientists in Washington. A Positive View of Prospects But a spokesman for the American nuclear power industry expressed a more positive view. ''I don't think the Soviet accident will sharply reduce the growth of nuclear power,'' said Eugene Gantzhorn of the Atomic Industrial Forum in New York. He noted that nearly all commercial reactors in other countries used a safer technology than the Soviet plant, which has graphite core reactors that are seldom built in the West and lack containment buildings to deter the escape of radiation. ''I believe common sense will prevail, and this will not stop needed nuclear power programs around the world,'' Mr. Gantzhorn said. Nuclear power now provides 15 percent of the world's electricity. Mr. Holmes, speaking by telephone, predicted that the Soviet accident might derail nuclear plans in four countries that were on the verge of ordering new reactors - the Netherlands, Italy, Finland and Britain. He said the accident had strengthened opponents of nuclear energy in additional countries, including West Germany and Switzerland. He said the accident could slow the planned expansion, with Soviet assistance, of nuclear energy in Eastern Europe, a region lacking in domestic energy resources. East European Voices Concern Yesterday an East European diplomat observed that a plant identical to the stricken Chernobyl station was under construction in his country. ''What are we supposed to do now?'' the diplomat asked in frustration. He said some East European countries had formed committees to examine the implications of the Soviet disaster for their own energy futures. The Soviet Union has laid plans to more than double nuclear energy output in the next five years, to nearly 70,000 megawatts, from 28,000 megawatts in operation at the end of 1985. Soviet energy planners consider the growth of nuclear capacity essential in the European regions of their country, which are getting short on fossil fuel sources, and Western experts declined to speculate about how Moscow's staunchly pro-nuclear policy might be affected by the Chernobyl disaster. Three European countries have rejected nuclear power in recent years. In 1978, Austria decided not to open an already built reactor, while Sweden, after the Three Mile Island incident, decided to phase out its 10 existing reactors by 2010. Last year Denmark decided to forgo the nuclear option. German Debate Intensifies In West Germany, which depends on nuclear reactors for about a third of its electricity, this week's disaster intensifed a debate over nuclear power. On Wednesday, the Green Party renewed its antinuclear campaign at a news conference, displaying signs reading, ''Chernobyl Is Everywhere,'' evoking signs held by demonstrators after the Three Mile Island accident that said ''Harrisburg Is Everywhere.'' The West German Government said the Soviet accident would have no effect on plans to add five more reactors to the 20 already operating. But some observers predicted that the antinuclear forces, especially vocal in the 1970's, would be strengthened anew. Nuclear power development in Britain has been stalled for years by a debate over what type of, if any, new reactors should be built. At a minimum, the Soviet accident appeared likely to delay still longer an awaited decision by the Government, after three years of hearings and debate, over whether to build Britain's first pressurized water reactor, a Westinghouse model that is a departure from previously built gas-cooled reactors. Nuclear reactors are also manufactured by General Electric, Babcock & Wilcox and Combustion Engineering of the United States; Siemens-Kraftwerk Union of West Germany, Framatome of France, British General Electric, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan and Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., as well as by the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. Britain Affirms Its Policy An official in the Prime Minister's office said it was ''ludicrous'' to suggest that British energy policy would be deflected by the Soviet accident, but opponents of nuclear power are mounting new protests. ''I think this may have tipped the balance against nuclear development here,'' said Mr. Holmes, the London energy analyst. France has been opening reactors at a rate of four a year, but the pace of construction is expected to slow, not because of qualms about the technology but because reactors already under construction are expected to meet most of the projected electricity needs. France derives nearly two-thirds of its electricity from nuclear power. The Soviet accident ''is not leading us to change our activities or policies,'' Michel Lajus, head of a Government committee on nuclear safety said this week. Effective public opposition has not emerged. Japan Is One-Fourth Nuclear Japan now gains more than a quarter of its electricity from 32 nuclear reactors. Eleven more are under construction and six others are planned. Opponents of nuclear power wield little political influence and experts doubted whether the Chernobyl disaster would slow the push for more nuclear energy in Japan, which is totally dependent on imports for oil.",1986-05-02T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world

Delegates at the international climate talks in Warsaw, which end Friday, lamented Japan’s move as a blow to worldwide efforts to slow global warming. In the Philippines, which is still collecting the dead from Typhoon Hayan, it served as yet another example of the indifference of the rich world to the plight of the world’s poorest nations on the front lines of climate change. But Japan’s about-face on its climate promises — which followed the government’s decision to shut down its nuclear power generators after the meltdown at the Daiichi nuclear plant in Fukushima — is also an opportunity for a reality check in the debate over how to slow the accumulation of greenhouse gases warming the atmosphere. It brings into sharp focus the most urgent challenge: How will the world replace fossil fuels? Can it be done fast enough, cheaply enough and on a sufficient scale without nuclear energy? For all the optimism about the prospects of wind, sun and tides to power our future, the evidence suggests the answer is no. Scrambling to find an alternative fuel to generate some 30 percent of its power, Japan had no choice but to turn to coal and gas. A few years ago, it promised that in 2020 it would produce 25 percent less greenhouse gas emissions than in 1990; last week it said it would, instead, produce 3 percent more. Japan is unlikely to be the only country to miss its targets. In response to the Fukushima disaster, Germany shut down eight nuclear reactors and said it would close the remaining nine by 2022. Everybody is promising to fill the gap with renewables. So far, however, coal and natural gas have won out. CO2 emissions in Germany actually increased 1 percent last year , even as they declined in the United States and most of Western Europe. Between 2010 and 2012, worldwide consumption of nuclear energy shrank 7 percent. Over the same period, the consumption of coal, the dirtiest fuel and the worst global warming offender, rose 4.5 percent. Data released on Tuesday by the Global Carbon Project confirmed that coal accounted for over half the growth in fossil fuel emissions in 2012. With energy consumption expected to grow by more than half over the next 30 years , the odds seem low that the world can avoid catastrophic warming without carbon-free nuclear power. Opponents of nuclear energy say the case for nuclear power underestimates its costs and unique risks, including the fact that no other energy source can produce the sudden devastation of a nuclear meltdown. And they say that nuclear proponents overstate the challenge that renewable energy faces in replacing fossil fuels. But while investment in renewable sources is crucially important to meet new energy needs, nuclear power remains the cheapest and most readily scalable of the alternative energy sources. Difficult as it may be to reduce dependence on coal, nuclear power is probably the world’s best shot. Take the Energy Information Agency’s estimate of the cost of generating power. The agency’s number-crunchers include everything from the initial investment to the cost of fuel and the expense to operate, maintain and decommission old plants. Its latest estimate, published earlier this year, suggests that power generated by a new-generation nuclear plant that entered service in 2018 would be $108.40 per megawatt-hour. (A megawatt-hour is enough to supply an hour’s worth of electricity to about 1,000 American homes.) This is not cheap. Even if the government were to impose a carbon tax of $15 per metric ton of CO2, a coal-fired plant would generate power at $100.10 to $135.50 per MWh, depending on the technology. Plants using natural gas could produce electricity for as little as $65.60 per MWh, even after paying the carbon tax. Still, nuclear power is likely to be cheaper than most power made with renewables. Land-based wind farms could generate power at a relatively low cost of $86.60 per MWh, but acceptable locations are growing increasingly scarce. Solar costs $144.30 per MWh, the agency estimates. A megawatt-hour of power fueled by an offshore wind farm costs a whopping $221.50. Even these comparisons underestimate the challenges faced in developing wind and solar power on a large scale. They might be clean and plentiful sources, but they require expensive transmission lines from where the sun shines and the wind blows to where the power is needed. Moreover, the sun doesn’t shine at least half the time. The wind doesn’t always blow. And we don’t yet know how to store electricity generated on hot summer days to use on cold winter nights. The sun has provided half of Germany’s power on some days. On others it has provided next to nothing. It’s not easy to build a power network, let alone an economy, on the basis of such an unreliable energy source. Perhaps the most levelheaded estimate of the relative cost of alternative fuels comes from the British government, which earlier this year published the price it was prepared to guarantee power generators as an incentive to develop renewable sources . The exercise underscored just how uncompetitive alternative sources of energy are, compared with coal and gas. It also revealed that nuclear power generated at a new plant in Somerset was expected to be significantly cheaper . The British government offered to guarantee a price of £92.50 per MWh of power generated at the Somerset plant. For offshore wind, the guarantees ranged from £155 per MWh at plants starting next year to £135 per MWh for those starting in 2018. What about the danger of nuclear power? What about the fish swimming in cesium-laced waters off the coast of Japan or the tens of thousands of evacuees fleeing radioactive fallout? In 2007 The Lancet medical journal published a study comparing deaths and illnesses associated with different sources of electricity — both from environmental pollution and accidents. Nuclear energy, it found, was about the safest around . Nuclear energy was responsible for 0.003 accidental deaths per terawatt-hour generated. Coal-fired electricity accounted for 15 times as many. “More than 10 years of operations would be needed before a single occupational death could be attributed to the plant” at a new French reactor, wrote the authors, Anil Markandya from the University of Bath and Paul Wilkinson from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Chernobyl, the worst nuclear accident in history, produced 50 additional deaths from cancer in 20 years, according to a study by 100 scientists from eight United Nations agencies . Of 800,000 people exposed to its radiation, a maximum of 4,000 may eventually die from cancer, according to the World Health Organization. Any such deaths are tragic, but there are downsides to all energy sources. The strongest evidence that nuclear energy is much safer than the public believes comes, of all places, from Japan. In 1945, the United States dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since then, 500 of the 100,000 or so survivors — 0.5 percent — have died prematurely because of radiation exposure.  Six decades worth of analysis of this population suggests the risks from radiation are unexpectedly low . The climate change scientist James Hansen, former head of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, argues that nuclear energy will save lives. In fact, it has prevented some 1.8 million air pollution-related deaths already. The good news is that the sun and the wind are not the world’s only alternative to fossil fuels. There are risks associated with nuclear power, but it looks a lot better than the energy we’ve got.",2013-11-19T23:29:46.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-economy

Doris Leuthard, the Swiss energy minister, said Switzerland would suspend plans to build and replace nuclear plants. She said no new ones would be permitted until experts had reviewed safety standards and reported back. Their conclusions will apply to existing plants as well as planned sites, she added. Swiss authorities recently approved three sites for new nuclear power stations. Germany will suspend “the recently decided extension of the running times of German nuclear power plants,” Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters in Berlin. “This is a moratorium and this moratorium will run for three months.” She said the suspension would allow for a thorough examination of the safety standards of the county’s 17 nuclear power plants. “There will be no taboos,” Mrs. Merkel said. Even when the three months is over, Mrs. Merkel warned, there would be no going back to the situation before the moratorium. Across Europe, officials worried about the Continent’s use of nuclear power as cooling systems failed at a third nuclear reactor in Japan and officials in that country struggled to regain control. The European Union called for a meeting on Tuesday of nuclear safety authorities and operators to assess Europe’s preparedness. Austria’s environment minister, Nikolaus Berlakovich, called for a European Union-wide stress test “to see if our nuclear power stations are earthquake-proof.” In Germany, with Mrs. Merkel’s center-right coalition facing important regional elections this month, the move was apparently in part an effort to placate the influential antinuclear lobby and give her coalition some breathing space before making a final decision about nuclear energy. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, called for a new risk analysis of the country’s nuclear plants, particularly regarding their cooling systems. He is the leader of the pro-business Free Democratic Party, which strongly supports nuclear power. A previous government, led by the Social Democrats and Greens, pushed through legislation in 2001 to close all of the country’s nuclear plants by 2021. But Mrs. Merkel’s center-right government reversed that decision last year and voted to extend the lives of the plants by an average of 12 years. Nuclear energy provides about 11 percent of Germany’s energy supply but its contribution to electricity output is about 26 percent. In Switzerland, the suspension of plans to build and replace plants will affect all “blanket authorization for nuclear replacement until safety standards have been carefully reviewed and if necessary adapted,” Ms. Leuthard, the energy minister, said in a statement. Switzerland has five nuclear reactors, which produce about 40 percent of the country’s energy needs. Ms. Leuthard said she had already asked the Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate to analyze the exact cause of the problems in Japan and draw up new or tougher safety standards “particularly in terms of seismic safety and cooling.” In Russia, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin said his government would not revise its ambitious program of building nuclear reactors but would “draw conclusions from what’s going on in Japan,” Russian news agencies reported. Nuclear power currently accounts for 16 percent of Russia’s electricity generation.",2011-03-14T17:30:45.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-global-business
a5a19995-fead-4b1f-a78b-943b987679e1,http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E2D7113CF933A2575BC0A9629C8B63,Four Workers Killed in Nuclear Plant Accident in Japan,"Superheated steam erupted from the ceiling of a nuclear power plant north of Kyoto on Monday, killing four workers and severely burning five others. It was Japan's worst nuclear accident. Officials said the steam was not contaminated by radioactivity. No evacuations were ordered of the town of Mihama, where the plant is situated. The Sea of Japan port is about 40 miles north of Kyoto, the country's historic capital. ''Radioactive materials weren't contained in the steam that leaked out,'' an official for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said at a news conference here. The Kansai Electric Power Company, owner of the 28-year-old reactor at Mihama, said in a statement, ''This incident will have no radiation effect on the surrounding environment.'' But the accident is likely to add to Japanese concerns about nuclear power, just as high oil prices and the war in Iraq make it more attractive to economic planners here. With the world's third largest nuclear power industry, after the United States and France, Japan relies on 52 nuclear power plants to generate almost one-third of the nation's electricity. But it has also been heavily dependent on oil imports from the Middle East and has worked aggressively with Russia over the last year to develop oil and gas deposits in Siberia. A government plan calls for building 11 more nuclear plants and raising the percentage of the nation's power supplied by nuclear energy to nearly 40 percent by 2010. But these plans have stalled as the public has become increasingly wary of nuclear power. Many towns have held referendums, voting against building nuclear plants. Wariness has been fueled by accidents and by a cover-up culture in which employees show far greater loyalty to their companies than to the public's right to know. Last summer, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, the nation's largest utility, was forced to close all 17 of its nuclear plants temporarily after admitting that it had faked safety reports for more than a decade. ''After the Tepco scandal of two years ago, today's accident would accelerate people's worry and suspicion about the safety management of the nuclear power plants,'' Satoshi Fujino, a staff member at Citizens' Nuclear Information Center, a private nuclear power watch organization, said in an interview. ''This plant is pretty old, and there are many plants even older.'' While the accident on Monday appeared not to involve radioactive releases, the horrific nature of the deaths has augmented the publicity. ''Staff rushed in screaming,'' a 65-year-old company cafeteria worker told Kyodo News. ''I put in a container all the ice I could find and gave it.'' Company officials said the accident took place in the turbine building of the No. 3 nuclear reactor in Mihama, which was scheduled to be closed Saturday for routine maintenance. About 200 workers were in the building at 3:30 p.m., when a two-foot-wide hole burst in a steel pipe that carried steam, pressurized and heated to as much as 400 degrees. All of the dead and injured men had been working in the second-floor room where the pipe burst. ''The ones who died had stark white faces,'' Yoshihiro Sugiura, a doctor who treated them, told The Associated Press. ''This shows they had rapidly been exposed to heat.'' The United States had a similar accident at the Surry nuclear power plant in southern Virginia almost two decades ago, when an 18-inch steel pipe burst and released 30,000 gallons of boiling water and steam, killing four people. Japanese nuclear safety officials said it would be impossible for the leaked steam to contain radioactivity because the water in the steam turbines does not come in contact with water used as a coolant for the reactor. Kansai Electric said it closed the 826,000-kilowatt nuclear generation unit at the reactor and was not sure when it would be restarted. A Kansai Electric official said at the news conference that the company was trying to determine the cause of the accident, and that the other two reactors at the complex would continue running. Yosaku Fuji, president of Kansai Electric, apologized and bowed deeply before reporters at the televised news conference. ''We are deeply sorry to have caused so much concern,'' he said. ''There is nothing we can say to the four who lost their lives. We pray for their souls from the bottom of our hearts and offer our condolences to their families. We are truly sorry.'' With the accident occurring on the 59th anniversary of the nuclear bombing of Nagasaki, political and industry leaders were quick on Monday to assure the public that a thorough investigation would take place. ''I think we must do our best to investigate the cause, to prevent a repeat, and to implement safety measures,'' said Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Takuya Ito, the public relations director of the Federation of Electric Power Companies, expressed concern in an interview that the accident could further hurt popular trust in nuclear power ''because these are the first deaths from an accident in a nuclear power plant in operation.'' The most recent fatality in the nuclear power industry was in 1999, at a fuel-reprocessing plant in Tokaimura, northeast of Tokyo, when a radiation leak killed two workers, exposed 600 people to low levels of radiation, and caused the evacuation of thousands of residents. That accident was caused by three workers who tried to save time by mixing excessive amounts of uranium in buckets instead of using special mechanized tanks. Two of the workers who caused the disaster later died from their injuries. More recently, in February, eight workers were exposed to low-level radiation at another power plant when they were accidentally sprayed with contaminated water. The doses were not considered dangerous. On Monday, a small fire broke out at a nuclear facility in Shimane Prefecture, 375 miles southwest of Tokyo. No one was injured and it posed no threat of radiation leaks. ''A fire broke out at a waste processing site, where we also have a laundry facility. But it was quickly extinguished,'' said a spokesman for Chugoku Electric Power Company, which operates the site.",2004-08-10T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world
b9edc51f-6846-4c04-9a27-2fb4597ba63c,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/06/us/politics/06nuke.html,McCain at Nuclear Plant Highlights Energy Issue,"NEWPORT, Mich.  Senator John McCain toured a nuclear power plant in Michigan on Tuesday to highlight his support for the construction of 45 new nuclear power generators by 2030, a position that he said distinguished him from his Democratic rival, Senator Barack Obama. Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican, portrayed his support of nuclear energy as part of an “all-of-the-above approach” to addressing the nation’s energy needs at a time of $4-a-gallon gasoline. He called it “safe, efficient, inexpensive and obviously a vital ingredient in the future of the economy of our nation and in our mission to eliminate over time our dependence on foreign oil.” “If we really want to enable new technologies tomorrow like plug-in electric cars, we need electricity to plug into,” he said in a statement after touring the Fermi 2 nuclear plant, its twin cooling towers spewing vapors used as a backdrop. “We need to do all this and more.” Both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama see expanded use of nuclear energy as a way to reduce dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels, although Mr. Obama has cautioned that the government must first consider issues like the disposal of nuclear waste and the security of nuclear materials. Even before Mr. McCain left South Dakota, where he campaigned at the freewheeling Sturgis Motorcycle Rally on Monday night, and headed to the plant in Michigan, Mr. Obama’s campaign had put out a statement rebuffing what it called Mr. McCain’s misrepresentation of Mr. Obama’s position on nuclear power. “Barack Obama supports safe and secure nuclear energy,” Bill Burton, a campaign spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. “Nuclear power represents more than 70 percent of our noncarbon generated electricity. It is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option. However, before an expansion of nuclear power is considered, Obama thinks key issues must be addressed including: security of nuclear fuel and waste, waste storage, and proliferation.” Those concerns, as well as the near meltdown at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania in 1979, and the ability to generate electricity cheaply in other ways, left the nuclear reactor construction business moribund for decades. More than 100 reactor orders were canceled in the 1970s, including all those ordered after 1973, and billions of dollars of work was abandoned. But market conditions have improved as demand for power has risen and the price of natural gas, a competing fuel, has jumped. Lately some environmental groups that had been critical of nuclear power have embraced it, seeing the technology as a way to meet the nation’s growing energy demands without contributing more heat-trapping gases. In addressing the nation’s energy demands, Mr. Obama has focused on alternative energy sources like wind and solar, as well as conservation, which would apparently also be the main beneficiaries of the decade-long $150 billion government investment effort he promises if elected. He barely mentions nuclear power, usually just alluding to it in a sentence here or there. “I think we do have to look at nuclear,” he said in an interview this spring on “Meet the Press,” “and what we’ve got to figure out is can we store the material properly? Can we make sure that they’re secure? Can we deal with the expense?” In his appearance at the nuclear plant, Mr. McCain expressed none of those doubts or concerns, asserting in his statement that the construction of the 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030 would create 700,000 jobs, a figure that many experts find to be inflated. He also said his experience serving on the nuclear-fueled aircraft carrier Enterprise had convinced him of the safety of nuclear power. Mr. McCain took no questions and limited his appearance to his statement and a tour of the plant with a single reporter and a photographer, part of a recent campaign strategy to limit his availability to the news media. During the tour, while standing in the center of the plant’s control room, surrounded by elaborate panels and consoles crammed with switches and green and red lights, he asked several questions related to the plant’s safety. “What would give you great cause for concern?” he asked Phillip Skarbek, the shift manager, and Anthony F. Earley Jr., the chief executive of DTE Energy, the owner of the plant, who conducted the tour. The plant has had a troubled history, with its original generating station, Fermi 1, which opened in 1957, suffering a partial fuel meltdown on Oct. 5, 1966. No outside contamination occurred, but Fermi 1 was taken off line in 1972 and decommissioned in 1975. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission says it expects to receive applications by the end of 2010 to build 34 nuclear plants, although only a handful are likely to be finished in the next decade. If demand for electricity continues to rise, as seems likely, it will be hard for the industry to maintain market share, much less displace the main carbon dioxide emitters, plants that burn coal. To try to jump-start the nuclear construction business, Congress in 2005 gave the industry three incentives. It provided loan guarantees of up to $18.5 billion, which would cover up to 80 percent of the value of a new reactor; it offered financial credits for producing electricity; and it offered a form of insurance to compensate for regulatory delays. Still, the so-called nuclear renaissance is moving slowly. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 was signed by President Bush on Aug. 8 of that year and has yet to produce a plant order.",2008-08-06T05:44:39.000+02:00,NYTIMES,national-u.s.-politics

All have combined to make this once-scorned form of energy far more palatable. “Italy has had the most dramatic, the most public turnaround, but the sentiments against nuclear are reversing very quickly all across Europe  Holland, Belgium, Sweden, Germany and more,” said Ian Hore-Lacey, spokesman for the World Nuclear Association, an industry group based in London. Nuclear power’s rehabilitation was underscored earlier this year when John Hutton, British Business Secretary, grouped it with “other low-carbon sources of energy” like biofuels. It had barely been mentioned in the government’s action plan on energy three years earlier. Echoing the sentiment on Thursday, Mr. Scajola said: “Only nuclear plants safely produce energy on a vast scale with competitive costs, respecting the environment.” A number of European countries have banned or restricted nuclear power over the last 20 years, including Italy, which closed all its plants. Germany and Belgium have long prohibited the building of new reactors, although operating ones were allowed to run their natural lifespan. France was one of the few countries that continued relying heavily on nuclear power. Environmental groups in Italy immediately attacked any plan to bring back nuclear power. Giuseppe Onufrio, a director of Greenpeace Italy, called it “a declaration of war.” Emma Bonino, an opposition politician who is vice president of the Italian Senate, said that it made no economic sense to build nuclear plants because they would not be ready for 2o years or longer. “We should be investing more in solar and wind,” she said. “We should be moving much more quickly to improve energy efficiency, of buildings, for example. That’s something Italy has never done anything with.” But conditions were very different in the 1980s, when European countries turned away from nuclear power: Oil cost under $50 a barrel, global warming was a fringe science and climate change had not been linked to man-made emissions. Perhaps more important for the public psyche, Europe’s nuclear bans and restrictions were almost all enacted in the years after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union. The equation has changed: Today, with oil approaching $150 a barrel, most European countries, which generally have no oil and gas resources of their own, have been forced by finances to consider new forms of energy  and fast. New nuclear plants take 20 years to build. Also, instead of Chernobyl, Europeans have more recently watched in horror as Russian president Vladamir Putin cut off the natural gas supply to Ukraine in a price dispute, leaving that country in darkness. New green technologies, like solar power, wind and biofuel, have not yet been scaled up to the point where they can form the backbone of a country’s energy strategy, and it is not clear that they will ever achieve that success. Italy is the largest net energy importer in Europe, but nearly all European countries rely heavily on imported energy  particularly oil and gas. ENEL, Italy’s leading energy provider, announced this year it would close its oil-fire power plants because the fuel had become unaffordable. Italians pay the highest energy prices in Europe. ENEL has been building new coal plants to fill the void left by oil, a move that created controversy in itself: coal plants are cheaper but create relatively high levels of carbon emissions, even using the type of new “clean coal” technology that ENEL had planned. A few European countries, like Germany and Poland, could likewise fall back on their abundant coal reserves if they turned away from oil and gas  but most of the coal mined in both countries is low grade and highly polluting. After today’s government announcement opening Italy to nuclear power ENEL’s managing director, Fulvio Conti, said “We are ready.” But he added that “new regulation and strong agreement on the plan within the country” would be needed. ENEL, which operates power plants in a number of European countries already has at least one nuclear plant, in Bulgaria, and has been researching so called 4th generation nuclear reactors. Italy old reactors still exist, but are too outdated to be re-opened and new ones would have to be built. The Italian government laid out few specifics plan to back its announcement and in calls to the ministry, officials said they were still studying issues like exactly what kind of plants could be built and, whether a new referendum would be legally required to re-open Italy to nuclear power. Indeed, Marzia Marzioli, who leads a citizens’ campaign against new coal plants in Italy, said nuclear was equally repellent. “As with coal, nuclear energy is the exact opposite of what we would like for Italy. “It is a choice that doesn’t consider the alternatives,” such as solar power, she said. To build nuclear plants, Italy would almost certainly have to improve its system of dealing with nuclear waste. Two hundred and thirty five tons of nuclear fuels are still being stored in the old plants that were shut down years ago. Ms. Bonino said she was concerned that Italy would be unable to safely process nuclear waste from new reactors and also that fuel could be supplied to rogue states trying to acquire nuclear capability. “I think this plan is being offered to satisfy the business community but I worry that security and waste are issues,” she said.",2008-05-23T08:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-europe
e78a55f6-d7dc-5daa-ba88-b69fc6632eec,https://www.tipsproject.eu/tips/,Nuclear Power Expansion in China Stirs Concerns,"SHENZHEN, China  China is preparing to build three times as many nuclear power plants in the coming decade as the rest of the world combined, a breakneck pace with the potential to help slow global warming. China’s civilian nuclear power industry  with 11 reactors operating and construction starting on as many as an additional 10 each year  is not known to have had a serious accident in 15 years of large-scale electricity production. And with China already the largest emitter of gases blamed for global warming, the expansion of nuclear power would at least slow the increase in emissions. Yet inside and outside the country, the speed of the construction program has raised safety concerns. China has asked for international help in training a force of nuclear inspectors. The last country to carry out such a rapid nuclear expansion was the United States in the 1970s, in a binge of reactor construction that ended with the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania in 1979. And China is placing many of its nuclear plants near large cities, potentially exposing tens of millions of people to radiation in the event of an accident. In addition, China must maintain nuclear safeguards in a national business culture where quality and safety sometimes take a back seat to cost-cutting, profits and outright corruption  as shown by scandals in the food, pharmaceutical and toy industries and by the shoddy construction of schools that collapsed in the Sichuan Province earthquake last year. “At the current stage, if we are not fully aware of the sector’s over-rapid expansions, it will threaten construction quality and operation safety of nuclear power plants,” Li Ganjie, the director of China’s National Nuclear Safety Administration, said in a speech this year. A top-level corruption scandal is already unfolding in the nuclear industry. In August, the Chinese government dismissed and detained the powerful president of the China National Nuclear Corporation, Kang Rixin, in a $260 million corruption case involving allegations of bid-rigging in nuclear power plant construction, according to official media reports. No charges have been reported against Mr. Kang, who is being held incommunicado for interrogation. While none of Mr. Kang’s decisions publicly documented would have created hazardous conditions at nuclear plants, the case is a worrisome sign that nuclear executives in China may not always put safety first in their decision-making. In contrast with its performance in industries like toys, China has a strong safety record in industries like aviation, which receive top-level government attention. The challenge for the government and for nuclear companies as they increase construction is to keep an eye on a growing army of contractors and subcontractors who may be tempted to cut corners. “It’s a concern, and that’s why we’re all working together because we hear about these things going on in other industries,” said William P. Poirier, a vice president for Westinghouse Electric, which is building four nuclear reactors in China. Philippe Jamet, the director of the division of nuclear installation safety at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, said that China had welcomed foreign inspectors at its reactors and that “they show pretty good operations safety.” But he added that the international agency was concerned about whether China would have enough nuclear inspectors with adequate training to handle the rapid expansion. “They don’t have very much staff, when you compare their staff with how many they will need,” Mr. Jamet said. The agency accepted a Chinese request to send a team of international experts to the country next year to assess staffing and training, he added. In late October, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao ordered a quintupling of the safety agency’s staff by the end of next year, to 1,000, according to United States regulators. Chinese officials did not respond to requests for confirmation. China has two rival state-owned nuclear power giants: the China National Nuclear Corporation, mainly in northeastern China, and the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group, mainly in southeastern China. Western experts regard the Daya Bay nuclear power plant in Shenzhen, which mainly uses French designs and is run by China Guangdong Nuclear, as evidence that China can run reactors safely. A display case holds trophies the power plant won in global safety competitions. China National Nuclear likewise cooperates with international inspectors and has had no reported mishaps. But its roots are in a government ministry with close ties to the former Soviet Union, making it more of an enigma to most Western experts, and the corruption case has added to their concern. China National Nuclear was on track to grow faster than China Guangdong over the next decade. China National Nuclear has sought to hush up the case involving the arrest of its president, deleting from its Chinese-language Web site even the most minor news releases that mentioned Mr. Kang. In a faxed response to questions, China National Nuclear made no mention of Mr. Kang, but emphasized that its plants met international standards. The arrest of Mr. Kang, a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s powerful Central Committee, can be seen as evidence of China’s seriousness about safety. Today, China’s nuclear plants can produce about nine gigawatts of power when operating at full capacity, supplying about 2.7 percent of the country’s electricity. Three years ago, the government set a goal of increasing that capacity more than fourfold by 2020. The government will soon announce a further increase in its targets, to 70 gigawatts of capacity by 2020 and 400 gigawatts by 2050, said Jiang Kejun, an energy policy director at the National Development and Reform Commission, the main planning agency. Electrical demand is growing so rapidly in China that even if the industry manages to meet the ambitious 2020 target, nuclear stations will still generate only 9.7 percent of the country’s power, by the government’s projections. Bringing so much nuclear power online over the next decade would reduce the country’s energy-related emissions of global warming gases by about 5 percent, compared with the emissions that would be produced by burning coal to generate the power. “For anyone concerned about carbon dioxide emissions, it’s heartening, but it’s only a piece of the puzzle,” said Jonathan Sinton, a China specialist at the International Energy Agency in Paris. China, which by most estimates overtook the United States in 2006 to become the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, is seeking sharp improvements in the energy efficiency of its economy. But the economy is growing so fast that even if the country can meet its goals, total emissions will rise 72 to 88 percent by 2020, Mr. Sinton said. The challenge for China is to build and operate its nuclear reactors without the equivalent of the Three Mile Island accident, in which a reactor core partly melted and released radioactivity, or the Chernobyl disaster in the former Soviet Union in 1986, the world’s worst civilian nuclear accident. China does not use the kind of reactor that exploded at Chernobyl. And engineers in China study the mistakes that poorly trained operators made at Three Mile Island. Liu Yanhua, a vice minister of science and technology, said China believed that its nuclear industry would continue to grow safely. “So far,” Mr. Liu said, “there is no damage.”",2009-12-15T21:15:46.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business

Ontario's energy minister, Dwight Duncan, said in a recent interview that in any overhaul of the power sector, the province would have to consider nuclear energy. ''The use of nuclear power is controversial,'' he said. ''We have some significant decisions to make.'' Introducing a bill to streamline regulation of the power sector and to attract private sector investment, Mr. Duncan said earlier this week, ''It is absolutely critical that we move forward quickly to boost new supply, increase conservation and maintain price stability for consumers.'' A new nuclear plant would most likely be built on the shore of one of the Great Lakes, where Ontario's three existing nuclear plants are. It would be the first in North America since confidence in atomic energy was shattered by an accident at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania in 1979. Energy policy in Canada is largely in the hands of the provinces, and a committee set up by the Ontario government to examine power supplies concluded in March that ''the right nuclear strategy will play a key role in ensuring that Ontario has reliable, competitively priced power over the long term.'' The panel, whose chairman was John Manley, a former deputy prime minister of Canada, said that the province ''must begin planning now to supplement and ultimately replace its aging nuclear assets with new and better generations of nuclear technology.'' Mr. Duncan, Ontario's energy minister, said in an interview that his government would probably decide this fall on the future role of nuclear power in the province. According to Roger W. Gale, chief executive of GF Energy, an industry consulting firm based in Washington with clients on both sides of the border, while ''the United States is at the study stage, Canada could potentially be at the doing stage.'' Canadian authorities are more likely to support the nuclear industry than their American counterparts, he and other experts said. Ontario is facing tight energy supplies, and a government-owned Canadian company ready and eager for new business has supplied every existing nuclear reactor in the country. The approval and other regulatory processes for new nuclear plants is also simpler in Canada. And public opposition will probably be more muted north of the border. The last fulfilled order for a nuclear power plant in the United States was in 1973; Canada's last was in 1978. Since then, almost all sizable generating stations built in either place have been fueled either by coal or, more recently, natural gas, though several other countries, like China, Japan, India and Russia, have continued to build nuclear plants. Ontario's existing nuclear power plants have been dogged by problems. Several units of the Pickering plant, east of Toronto on the shores of Lake Ontario, and the Bruce plant, on the shores of Lake Huron, have not been restarted since they were taken out of service seven years ago for safety reasons. Nuclear power accounts for 45 percent of electricity generating capacity in Ontario, but 14 percent in Canada. That compares with 20 percent in the United States, where several proposals for new nuclear plants are inching forward. Various consortiums -- among them, one that includes the Exelon Corporation of Chicago and the Entergy Corporation of New Orleans, two of the country's largest nuclear plant owners -- are in the early stages of applying for licenses to build and operate new plants. In May, the Department of Energy agreed to finance half the $4.25 million cost of a detailed study by a different group, led by the Tennessee Valley Authority, to build two nuclear generating units at a site near Hollywood, Ala. Construction of any American projects is not expected to start before 2010 at the earliest, however, said J. Scott Peterson, a vice president at the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade group in Washington. The sense of urgency is considerably greater in Canada, where, experts say, construction could begin a couple of years earlier. Mr. Duncan said Ontario needed to refurbish, replace or conserve 25,000 megawatts of generating capacity by the year 2020, equal to 80 percent of current power supplies. He estimated that these investments would cost 25 billion to 40 billion Canadian dollars ($18 billion to $29 billion). At the same time, the provincial government, seeking to cut pollution, has pledged to phase out all five of Ontario's coal-fired generating stations by 2007, plants that now generate about a fifth of the province's electricity. Compounding the drive for new capacity is uncertainty over the future of three idled units at the big Pickering plant, run by the government-owned Ontario Power Generation. The estimated cost of repairs to these and another unit that was restarted last year, originally 1.1 billion Canadian dollars, has escalated to 3 billion to 4 billion Canadian dollars. The authorities are now mulling whether to press ahead with the repairs or abandon the reactors. With the coal plants destined for oblivion and the attraction of natural gas diluted by volatile prices, some consider nuclear the clear favorite for expansion of the province's base load power capacity. ''There's certainly a climate now where it's being seriously considered,'' said Duncan Hawthorne, chief executive of Bruce Power, the company that operates the 6,200-megawatt Bruce station on Lake Huron. Another factor favoring the nuclear option is the development of a new reactor by Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., a government corporation known for its heavy-water Candu -- Canada Deuterium Uranium -- plants. All 17 reactors currently operating in Canada are Candu models. Ian Dovey, a company spokesman, said it expected to win regulatory approval for the new model, known as the ACR-700, by the end of 2006. According to Tom Adams, executive director of Energy Probe, a Toronto-based research group that campaigns against nuclear power, the climate is friendlier toward the nuclear industry in Canada than in the United States in large part because of government support for Atomic Energy of Canada. Mr. Gale, the Washington consultant, said that if all went smoothly, construction work on a new nuclear plant in Ontario could begin by 2008. But numerous obstacles must be overcome. According to Mr. Hawthorne of Bruce Power, there needs to be greater certainty on the cost and financing of a new plant, as well as the selling price of its output. Bruce Power's 2,300-acre site, 150 miles northwest of Toronto, is a possible location for a new plant. Mr. Hawthorne said that the company would probably decide within the next year whether to refurbish those of its eight existing reactors nearing the end of their lives by 2012, or build new ones, or both. The prospect of new nuclear plants has so far raised little public concern in Ontario. Glenn R. Sutton, the mayor of Kincardine, the town closest to the Bruce plant, describes the local community as ''pro-nuclear.'' Most of Bruce Power's 3,000 workers live in or near Kincardine, population 12,000. Still, nuclear power is not without critics in Ontario, and protests could grow as the planning process moves forward. A recent report by the Ontario Clean Air Alliance, an environmental group, concluded that the Manley committee's findings were based on unreliable assumptions. In an interview, the group's chairman, Jack Gibbons, rated the chances that a new nuclear station would be built in the province as ''extremely low,'' because the province's needs could be met by cheaper and more reliable power sources, like natural gas and hydro and wind power and by conservation. Besides, said Frank de Jong, chairman of the Green Party of Ontario, ''people are still not convinced of the safety of nuclear power.''",2004-06-18T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business

Although the world now relies on nuclear power plants for 15 percent of its electricity, popular mistrust could bring a virtual end to the nuclear age early in the next century, according to a report published today by the Worldwatch Institute, a research organization. In a paper entitled ''Reassessing Nuclear Power: The Fallout from Chernobyl,'' the privately financed orgnaization said the political consequences of the accident last April at the Soviet Union's Chernobyl reactor was the ''collapse in country after country'' of a ''pro-nuclear consensus'' and the growth of anxiety about nuclear safety to levels that government leaders could not ignore. Citing post-Chernobyl opinion polls, the report said: ''Over two-thirds of the people in most countries are now against building more nuclear plants, numbers that have increased significantly since Chernobyl. Indeed, about half the people of Europe favor the shutdown of existing facilities.'' Report Is Ridiculed The report was ridiculed by the Atomic Industrial Forum, a nuclear industry trade association. Accusing the Worldwatch Institute of being ''grossly and consistently wrong,'' Don Winston, an association spokesman, said Worldwatch Institute earlier urged ''a transition to a post-petroleum world in which coal-burning would be undesirable and almost all energy would be provided by solar or photovoltaic devices, wind, wood and water. Now they're talking smoke again - burning coal to replace nuclear.'' ''It's the solution du jour,'' Mr. Winston said. ''The Worldwatch Institute appears to favor a pastoral world without the burdens of advanced technology. It adds up to a distrust of technology.'' The Atomic Industrial Forum reported earlier this week, ''The American nuclear power industry surpassed a milestone in 1986, when more than 100 nuclear generating units were licensed to operate.'' In the United States, the Worldwatch report said, ''public support of further nuclear development fell from 64 percent in 1975 to 19 percent in 1986.'' The report predicted, ''Nuclear power's share of world electricity could actually be lower in the year 2000 than it is in 1987.'' Forecasting ''the impending collapse of the U.S. nuclear construction business,'' which since 1974 has not had an order for a new plant that was not subsequently canceled, the report said, ''The United States led the world into the nuclear age and now appears to be leading it out.'' The 91-page Worldwatch report was written by Christopher Flavin, a senior researcher at the institute. It concluded that public distrust of nuclear power technology did not begin with the Chernobyl reactor accident. ''The accident was simply the worst of a series of developments that had already disenchanted many people,'' the report said. ''If Chernobyl is compared with a heart attack, it is clear that the ailment struck a patient already afflicted with cancer.'' In a survey of developments outside the United States, the study said that governments in power had approved the abandonment of nuclear programs in Sweden, Denmark, Austria, New Zealand and the Philippines and had canceled or delayed proposed nuclear construction projects in Italy, Spain, Greece, the Netherlands, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Italy and Spain. The report said that nuclear power was ''fast becoming an international question in which nations have a moral duty to consider the effects on neighboring states.'' ''Since Chernobyl,'' the report said, ''Danish officials have objected to a Swedish plant, German officials to a French plant, Austrian officials to a German plant, and Hong Kong officials to a Chinese plant. ''Chernobyl was an event of major historical proportions that later generations will undoubtedly mark as a milestone of the 20th century. Its real importance lies not in the actual accident but in the fact that it has triggered international political recognition of the economic and human tragedy that nuclear power threatens to become.''",1987-03-08T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

''There is nothing strange about this,'' he said. ''We have sent study groups to a number of countries including Brazil and the United States.'' China has abandoned plans to build a string of nuclear power stations. It is continuing work on only two stations -one near Hong Kong using French technology and one near Shanghai.

The footage was released by the Energoatom State Company. Credit Credit... Energoatom State Company KYIV, Ukraine — A Russian missile exploded near the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant just after midnight on Monday and forced a shutdown at a hydroelectric station, Ukrainian officials said, in the latest attack by Moscow on critical infrastructure in Ukraine. A missile exploded less than 1,000 feet from the nuclear plant’s reactors and caused extensive damage around a hydroelectric power station in the industrial zone that surrounds the nuclear complex. There was no damage to essential safety equipment at the nuclear power plant, which remained fully operational, the company said. No casualties were immediately reported. The South Ukraine plant, Ukraine’s second largest functioning nuclear power station, is some 300 miles west of the larger Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is occupied by Russian forces and has come under repeated shelling. Ukraine’s national nuclear energy company, Energoatom, said on Monday that “the Russian army launched a missile attack on the industrial zone of the South Ukrainian nuclear power plant” at 12:20 a.m, causing “a powerful explosion” about 1,000 feet from the reactors. Its shock wave blew out more than 100 windows at the nuclear plant, according to the company, which released security camera footage that showed a massive fireball lighting up the night sky over the site. The blast forced the shutdown of one of the hydroelectric plant’s hydraulic units, causing partial power outages in the area. The nuclear plant, near the city of Yuzhnoukrainsk in the Mykolaiv region, is part of the South Ukrainian Energy Complex, which includes the hydroelectric plant and one other power station. It lies more than 100 miles north of the city of Mykolaiv and far from any frontline fighting. The strike revived concerns about the safety of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants as Russia steps up attacks aimed at degrading critical energy infrastructure. Before the war, 15 working reactors at four nuclear power plants produced more than half of Ukraine’s electricity, the second highest share among European nations after France. The situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant — which has been occupied by Russian forces since early in the war but is operated by Ukrainian engineers — appears to have stabilized in recent days after the plant resumed receiving electricity from the country’s power grid on Friday. But its reactors have all been shut down as a safety measure after Energoatom determined that it was too risky to keep them running as fighting continued nearby. The Zaporizhzhia plant, when it was fully operational, supplied about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity. Russia’s assaults on Ukraine’s power infrastructure have continued as its campaign on the battlefield falters. After its forces were driven out of northeastern Ukraine just over a week ago, the Kremlin launched missile strikes on a major heat and power plant in Kharkiv, briefly plunging the region into blackout. Ukrainian officials have said they can still produce enough energy to meet the nation’s needs this winter, but damage to critical infrastructure in towns and cities will make it difficult to transmit electricity to hundreds of thousands of consumers. Those living in territory recently reclaimed by Ukrainian forces, and in other parts of the country hit hard by fighting, have been urged to evacuate or not to return home until the fighting is over. And for the estimated 1.2 million people living in parts of Ukraine occupied by Russian forces, access to electricity is unclear. In some places, heating, water and power infrastructure have been destroyed or badly damaged. Blackouts are frequently reported in parts of occupied southern Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow’s strikes on energy infrastructure were intended to make Ukrainians suffer as temperatures drop, and to prevent Kyiv from exporting energy to other parts of Europe, where sanctions against Russian energy have contributed to soaring gas and electricity bills, creating havoc for consumers and businesses. “Russia is trying to prevent us from using Ukraine’s capabilities to stabilize the situation in Europe,” he said last week. “Our ability to export electricity is something that Russia is very afraid of right now. Because we can foil Russian plans to squeeze every penny out of ordinary European citizens this winter as energy prices are expected to skyrocket.”",2022-09-19T13:37:16.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

CITING SAFETY, TO SHUT DOWN NUCLEAR PLANT","The Tennessee Valley Authority, citing concern over key emergency safety equipment, announced today that it would shut down the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant indefinitely. The shutdown will leave the Federal power agency without nuclear-generated electricity. The authority has already closed another nuclear plant and has delayed seeking a license for its third because of safety problems. ''I view this action as consistent with T.V.A.'s safety-first operating policy and I have so informed the T.V.A. board today,'' said Hugh G. Parris, the authority's nuclear chief. Plant officials have begun shutting down Unit 2 at the plant outside Chattanooga and both units should be shut down by Friday afternoon, he said. Mr. Parris, who took over the authority's nuclear program last month, said an independent review of the agency's program on ''environmental qualification of equipment'' had raised questions about whether certain safety equipment, such as pump motors, electrical valve operators and limit switches, would work in an emergency. Lack of Confidence Cited ''There were enough problems identified that we no longer have the degree of confidence that we feel we must have that these key safety systems would work if called on,'' Mr. Parris said. The review by Westec Services Inc., a consulting concern in Philadelphia, found that the authority did not have enough documentation to prove the equipment would work if exposed to temperatures, pressure and radiation caused by an accident, Mr. Parris said. ''At this time, we do not know how long the Sequoyah units will be shut down,'' he said. ''That will be determined as we review our program and make the necessary changes.'' There have been two leaks of radioactive water at the plant in the last month. Eleven workers received what the T.V.A. said was minor contamination July 30 when about 600 gallons of water used to cool the reactor leaked from a line in Unit 2. A similar but smaller leak occurred Aug. 11 in Unit 1. Tests indicated vibrations caused both leaks, the authority said today. In March, the power authority's board ordered the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant near Athens, Ala., shut down indefinitely after questions were raised about the safety of its operation. Fines of Over $1 Million The T.V.A. has been fined more than $1 million by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission since 1980 for safety violations at its nuclear plants. The biggest part of that amount has been for violations at Browns Ferry, a three-reactor plant opened in 1974. The power agency, which also gets electricity from 12 coal-fired plants and 29 hydroelectric plants, serves 7.8 million people in Tennessee and parts of Kentucky, North Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi. Earlier this summer, the power authority dropped plans to immediately seek a low-power operating license for its Watts Bar nuclear plant near Spring City, Tenn., after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission asked it to examine questions raised by employees about the plant's safety. The power authority hired a Kansas concern, the Quality Technology Corporation, to interview the plant's 4,800 workers. So far, 22 of 38 complaints about safety at Watts Bar have been verified and must be corrected, the power authority said. Because of its shortage of nuclear power generation, along with the dry weather, the power authority's board is expected to approve a 6.9 percent rate increase at its meeting Aug. 29. ---- $100,000 Fine Proposed MIAMI, Aug. 21 (AP) - The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has recommended a $100,000 fine of the Florida Power and Light Company for what an official called a potentially dangerous situation at the Turkey Point nuclear power plant. The utility allowed water in the spent fuel pool, used to store radioactive fuel rods removed from the reactor, to drain to a ''dangerously low level,'' J. Nelson Grace, regional administrator for the commission, said Tuesday. Officials of the utility said they had not decided whether to appeal.

Credit... Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters All three nuclear power plants under Ukrainian control are back online and will soon be producing energy at normal capacity, the head of the national energy utility said on Friday, two days after Russian missile strikes that forced utility crews to scramble to stabilize the country’s crippled energy grid and raised further concerns about the nuclear perils of the war. Ukraine typically relies on nuclear power for more than half of its energy, an uncommonly high rate of dependence. The Russian attacks on Wednesday triggered emergency protections at the three plants and required a halt to production. “Now the energy system is fully integrated; all regions are connected,” said Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the chief executive officer of Ukrenergo, the national utility. He added that utility crews are prepared to react to further Russian attacks, but urged consumers to save electricity. Wednesday marked the first time in the 40-year history of the country’s nuclear power industry that all operating nuclear facilities were shut down and had to rely on emergency diesel generators, officials said For months, attacks in and around the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have left engineers racing from one crisis to the next as it has repeatedly been disconnected from the national energy grid. External power was restored on Thursday morning at the plant a day after it was lost, according to the United Nation’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has had inspectors at the facility since early September. That plant, Europe’s largest, has been offline since September but still needs electricity to keep cooling equipment running around the clock and ward off a nuclear meltdown. “The complete and simultaneous loss of off-site power for Ukraine’s nuclear power plants shows that the situation for nuclear safety and security in the country is become increasingly precarious, challenging and potentially dangerous,” Rafael Grossi, the U.N. agency’s director general, said on Thursday. “This would have been completely unimaginable before this tragic war. It is extremely concerning.” The agency has started providing assistance at Ukraine’s other nuclear power plants after it was requested by Kyiv, Mr. Grossi said. “We must do everything to prevent a nuclear accident at any of these facilities, which would only add to the terrible suffering we are already witnessing in Ukraine,” he said. Snow and freezing rain worsened the plight of millions of Ukrainians who remained without power Thursday evening. Officials said electricity had been restored to meet about half of the country’s consumption needs as of 7 p.m. The city government in Kyiv, the capital, said on Friday morning that water had been fully restored but that half of the city’s housing stock was still in emergency power outage mode. A significant number of thermal and hydroelectric plants were back in operation, Ukrenergo said in its Telegram channel. Authorities were prioritizing restoring energy to critical infrastructure — gas distribution, sewage treatment, and hospitals — before household consumers, the utility said. “Energy workers, utility workers, business — everyone is doing their part to give light again,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in his nightly address. “This is truly a nationwide task — Ukraine is working as unitedly as possible in this.”",2022-11-25T13:03:32.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

IN two weeks the Tennessee Valley Authority, America’s largest public power producer, will decide whether to complete construction of a long-deferred generating unit at the Bellefonte Nuclear Plant, in northeast Alabama. If we proceed, Bellefonte 1 would become the T.V.A.’s third nuclear unit brought into service in the 21st century. This is, understandably, a controversial issue. Why are we thinking of expanding our fleet of nuclear plants in the wake of the Fukushima disaster? After all, some countries seem to be going the other way: Germany and others are planning to cut back or eliminate their nuclear power facilities altogether. Indeed, whether the Bellefonte project moves forward or not, the T.V.A. is committed to demonstrating that a methodical, safety-driven approach to nuclear development works. Along with the possibility of restarting work at Bellefonte, in recent years we have upgraded our Browns Ferry 1 reactor, also in Alabama, and we are completing a second reactor at our Watts Bar plant, in eastern Tennessee. The reason for the commitment is simple: for all the recent news, nuclear is still our best choice for producing large amounts of round-the-clock, reliable electricity that is affordable, safe and clean. The Tennessee Valley Authority, a federal corporation, was formed in 1933 to rescue a large section of the Depression-ravaged South along the Tennessee River watershed. The power was originally provided by dams, but over the years they were supplemented with coal, gas and nuclear plants. Today some 9 million people get their power from us. The Tennessee Valley Authority has operated nuclear plants for three decades, but our program was hindered, as many energy providers were, by safety concerns and a public backlash against nuclear generation in the 1980s. Our response, however, was not to abandon nuclear energy. Instead, we revamped our program and adopted a more conservative, disciplined approach to both operations and construction. In a departure from the 1970s, when we were building 17 nuclear units at once, today we allow only one unit to be in any single stage of development at a time. We believe that nuclear power, developed properly, is not only a promising option, but the best available. Our forecasts for the region’s energy demands by the end of the decade show we will need more base-load electricity — or continuous minimum power — something nuclear plants excel at providing. Fortunately, we have a ready option at hand. Construction at Bellefonte began in 1974, but projections of stagnant energy demand led the T.V.A. to stop work in 1988. Because Bellefonte was never operated and was well preserved after being deferred, much of the plant is in excellent condition today. Moreover, if approved, the plant would undergo a six- to eight-year, $5-billion makeover. Major components — like the two large steam generators — critical wiring, instrumentation and thousands of other pieces of equipment would be replaced. When completed, the plant that some label a dinosaur would be among the most modern, thoroughly inspected and safest nuclear facilities in the nation. Nevertheless, critics have rightly asked, why not simply bypass nuclear power and rely on more wind, solar, gas and energy efficiency? In fact, the T.V.A. is adding power from all of those sources in record amounts. But none can produce sufficiently large volumes of base-load electricity as consistently and affordably as nuclear power can. No energy source is perfect. But the risks associated with nuclear power are well understood and — with the proper emphasis on safety — they are entirely manageable. Fukushima taught us that we must be prepared for what was once considered almost unimaginable, and we are incorporating the lessons of that disaster into our everyday operations. At the Tennessee Valley Authority, our strategy for meeting the electricity challenges of the future is a balanced portfolio of energy production that relies somewhat less on coal, and more on energy efficiency, gas, renewable and nuclear power. If cost, reliability and cleaner air are important, nuclear energy must be part of the mix.",2011-07-30T03:51:22.000+02:00,NYTIMES,oped-opinion

The Greens have their roots not only in Germany’s environmental movement, but also in its grass-roots antinuclear protests, where the police clashed with activists, who sometimes chained themselves to the gates of nuclear plants. Annalena Baerbock, the Green foreign minister, grew up going to such demonstrations, where human chains were formed in protest of nuclear plants. Even as many in her party begin to accept what looks inevitable, Ms. Baerbock insisted on Wednesday that she still believed an extension of nuclear power was “not an option.” It is an irony of politics that it was Ms. Merkel who became the poster child for Germany’s “nuclear exit.” Her Christian Democrats were long proponents of nuclear power, and her government fought to extend the life of nuclear power after a previous left-leaning government sought to shut it down. She defended that move by arguing atomic energy was the “bridging technology” paving the way toward a renewable energy system in Germany — the same language her party later used to defend the shift to gas. But the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in 2011 forced her into a U-turn, after her party faced a catastrophic loss in regional elections to the Greens, who campaigned against nuclear power. Germans, long split over nuclear issues, had shifted against atomic energy, and Ms. Merkel soon took seven of Germany’s 17 nuclear power plants offline.",2022-08-05T14:02:39.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

That's why Dick Gregory pledged at a huge anti-nuke demonstration in 1979 that he would eat no solid food until all nuclear plants in the U.S. were shut down. Mr. Gregory may be getting hungry. But it's time for the rest of us to drop that hostility to nuclear power. It's increasingly clear that the biggest environmental threat we face is actually global warming, and that leads to a corollary: nuclear energy is green. Nuclear power, in contrast with other sources, produces no greenhouse gases. So President Bush's overall environmental policy gives me the shivers, but he's right to push ahead for nuclear energy. There haven't been any successful orders for new nuclear plants since 1973, but several proposals for new plants are now moving ahead -- and that's good for the world we live in. Global energy demand will rise 60 percent over the next 25 years, according to the International Energy Agency, and nuclear power is the cleanest and best bet to fill that gap. Solar power is a disappointment, still accounting for only about one-fifth of 1 percent of the nation's electricity and costing about five times as much as other sources. Wind is promising, for its costs have fallen 80 percent, but it suffers from one big problem: wind doesn't blow all the time. It's difficult to rely upon a source that comes and goes. In contrast, nuclear energy already makes up 20 percent of America's power, not to mention 75 percent of France's. A sensible energy plan must encourage conservation -- far more than Mr. Bush's plans do -- and promote things like hybrid vehicles and hydrogen fuel cells. But for now, nuclear power is the only source that doesn't contribute to global warming and that can quickly become a mainstay of the grid. Is it safe? No, not entirely. Three Mile Island and Chernobyl demonstrated that, and there are also risks from terrorist attacks. Then again, the world now has a half-century of experience with nuclear power plants, 440 of them around the world, and they have proved safer so far than the alternatives. America's biggest power source is now coal, which kills about 25,000 people a year through soot in the air. To put it another way, nuclear energy seems much safer than our dependency on coal, which kills more than 60 people every day. Moreover, nuclear technology has become far safer over the years. The future may belong to pebble-bed reactors, a new design that promises to be both highly efficient and incapable of a meltdown. Radioactive wastes are a challenge. But burdening future generations with nuclear wastes in deep shafts is probably more reasonable than burdening them with a warmer world in which Manhattan is submerged under 20 feet of water. Right now, the only significant source of electricity in the U.S. that does not involve carbon emissions is hydropower. But salmon runs have declined so much that we should be ripping out dams, not adding more. What killed nuclear power in the past was cold economics. Major studies at M.I.T. and elsewhere show that nuclear power is still a bit more expensive than new coal or natural gas plants, but in the same ballpark if fossil fuel prices rise. And if a $200-per-ton tax was imposed on carbon emissions, nuclear energy would become cheaper than coal from new plants. So it's time to welcome nuclear energy as green . Indeed, some environmentalists are already climbing onboard. For example, the National Commission on Energy Policy, a privately financed effort involving environmentalists, academics and industry representatives, issued a report in December that favors new nuclear plants. One of the most eloquent advocates of nuclear energy is James Lovelock, the British scientist who created the Gaia hypothesis, which holds that Earth is, in effect, a self-regulating organism. ''I am a Green, and I entreat my friends in the movement to drop their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy,'' Mr. Lovelock wrote last year, adding: ''Every year that we continue burning carbon makes it worse for our descendents. Only one immediately available source does not cause global warming, and that is nuclear energy.'' Op-Ed Columnist E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com",2005-04-09T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,opinion

Analysts say that producers of gas, coal and oil may have had their future earnings and equity appreciation prospects brightened as the energy industry intensifies its quest for alternatives to nuclear power. To some experts the effects on the energy industry from the Russian disaster can be equated with what happened following the Arab oil embargo in 1973, when rising oil costs spurred shifts to such traditional energy sources as coal and natural gas. Other analysts, however, are more cautious. Although companies that took the nuclear route paid the highest dividends of any energy group, this has not halted their slide from favor since the accident in 1979 involving the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor in this country. ''In the wake of Chernobyl many people who own nuclear stocks have either sold them or will sell them and reinvest some of that capital into a logical extension - natural gas and coal,'' said John Slatter, utilities analyst at Prescott, Ball & Turben in Cleveland. In light of the current situation, Mr. Slatter says he likes the Delmarva Power and Light Company, the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, the Duke Power Company and the Northern States Power Company. While Baltimore Gas and Duke Power have nuclear plants, those facilities have been completed and therefore do not face the problems of cost overruns, delays, rules and regulations pertaining to construction of new nuclear plants, or public opposition to completion of plants. ''If a shift away from nuclear energy to other energy sources does in fact constitute a trend, there will be upward price pressure on nonnuclear energy sources such as coal, gas and oil,'' said Richard Schmidt, director of research of the Advest Group Inc. in Hartford. ''I would be very con-cerned about the stocks of companies that are involved in major nuclear construction projects.'' Mr. Schmidt says his firm likes electrical utilities that have no significant nuclear exposures, such as Allegheny Power System Inc. and the Midwest Energy Company; gas concerns such as the Bay State Gas Company and the Providence Energy Corporation; the Mobil and Exxon Corporations among the oils, which may experience some firming of prices, and, among the coals, the Pittston Company, on the assumption that some utilities might choose limited coal use. ''Natural gas local distribution companies are safe havens for income-conscious investors,'' said Barry Sahgal, energy analyst at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. He said that adequate supplies of gas, improved responsiveness to competitive pricing, a better regulatory environment, stronger balance sheets, predictable cash flows and prospects for dividend growth most likely would continue to attract investor interest in the local distribution group. Mr. Sahgal said his investment recommendations would include the Brooklyn Union Gas Company, the Connecticut Energy Corporation and the Public Service Company of North Carolina. ''Investors should view the Chernobyl disaster as an opportunity to invest in quality companies with strong fundamentals where they might realize a longer-term benefit rather than instant gratification,'' Mr. Saghal added. While most of the focus away from nuclear power has been on traditional energy, more exotic forms are also drawing interest. ''Since the oil embargo, a vigorous industry of independent power producers has emerged,'' said Donald Marier, publisher of Alternative Sources of Energy, the magazine of the independent power production industry. ''The Chernobyl disaster should cause investors to take a closer look at the independents who often use renewable energy sources.'' Mr. Marier said the technologies currently being developed or improved upon include renewable sources such as geothermal energy, solar energy and water and wind power. Mr. Marier said independents that might possibly benefit from the continued swing away from nuclear energy include the Catalyst Energy Development Corporation and Cogenic Energy Systems in cogeneration; Ultrasystems Inc. in wood-fired cogeneration systems, and Energy Conversion Devices and the Chronar Corporation in solar cell energy. A cogeneration plant produces steam for heating or cooling and also produces electricity. Some cogeneration plants are operated from fossil fuels while others are fired from solid wastes or from biomass, wood or agricultural wastes. Analysts see continuing growth opportunities for independent power producers, particularly in ''rate-shock'' areas where consumers face large electrical rate increases with nuclear power plants coming into the rate base.",1986-05-09T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,financial-desk-business-day

The commission and officials of the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant in Wiscasset said the flames, heat and firefighting efforts did no damage to the reactor or other nuclear parts of the plant. Automatic firefighting equipment in the nuclear part was not needed, they said. The fire began at 6:32 P.M. in the non-nuclear part of the plant, plant officials and the commission said. Its cause has not been determined, but employees told Federal investigators they heard what appeared to be explosions before the fire broke out near the plant's main electrical transformer and beneath the turbine generator. The fire occurred 100 feet to 200 feet from the containment building that encases the plant's nuclear reactor within a 4 1/2-foot-thick wall of concrete reinforced with steel. Plant officials said the fire burned for four hours and was fed by hydrogen used to cool the generator. It was hot enough to cause the main electrical transformer to buckle, rupturing seals, and allowing thousands of gallons of lubricating oil to spill into a catchment area outside the plant. At least 200 gallons of oil leaked into the Back River, plant officials said. No one was injured, plant officials said today in a prepared statement. System Worked, Officials Say Richard H. Wessman, project director in the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, stressed that although the fire appeared to be severe such accidents have occurred before in nuclear and conventionally powered electrical generating plants. The automatic shutdown system, as intended, shut down the reactor without incident immediately after the fire broke out, he said. At a news conference this afternoon, Maine Yankee's president, Charles Frizzle, also said the fire could have happened at any power plant. ""I don't want to downgrade the seriousness of the event,"" Mr. Frizzle said, ""but it's not a nuclear event. From my perspective, this should not reflect negatively on the use of nuclear power. It has nothing to do with nuclear power."" Crucial Time for Industry The accident occurred during a politically sensitive period for the American nuclear power industry. On Thursday, the regulatory commission is to rule on a staff recommendation to restart a reactor at Browns Ferry, a troubled nuclear plant near Athens, Ala., that has been shut for safety reasons since March 1985. John Moulton, a spokesman for the Tennessee Valley Authority in Knoxville, Tenn., the plant's owner, said the accident in Maine should not effect the decision to restart Browns Ferry. Next week, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is scheduled to vote on a measure that would streamline the licensing procedures for nuclear power plants. The changes, proposed by the committee's chairman, Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana, would make licensing a one-step process and eliminate almost every stage that enables the public to make comments. The Bush Administration has also staked a sizeable portion of its national energy strategy on reviving nuclear power. It says the 110 American nuclear power plants are safe and are far less polluting than electric power plants fueled by coal or oil. The Administration has also financed studies through the Department of Energy to design a new generation of nuclear reactors that would be largely incapable of melting down. But critics of the technology say that splitting atoms to gain energy is inherently dangerous and insist that the mining, milling, and processing of uranium for nuclear fuel is one of the dirtiest and most dangerous industries in the United States. Moreover, they say, the Administration has yet to find a permanent solution for safe disposal of radioactive wastes from nuclear power plants. The regulatory commission reported today that unplanned incidents occurred Monday and last week at two other nuclear plants in New England, forcing their shutdown. A leak of hot water in the nuclear containment vessel at the Pilgrim nuclear plant in Plymouth, Mass. prompted its shutdown on Monday, the commission said, but no radiation was released. The plant's owner, the Boston Edison Company, had been aware of the leak for weeks before the shutdown and planned to repair it during a planned shutdown beginning May 4. A worsening of the leak caused the utility to take the reactor out of service early. The other incident occurred April 24, when the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant five miles south of Brattleboro suddenly lost its primary source of power. The interruption of power prompted the plant to turn on its independent electrical generators and led to an unplanned shutdown of the reactor. The incident may have caused when an employee mistakenly tripped a switch that caused all power into the plant to be cut off, the regulatory commission said. Its investigators are studying the incident. For more than a decade Maine Yankee, which sits along the coast about 40 miles northeast of Portland, has been at the center of a struggle between environmentalists and the nuclear power industry. Critics tried three times from 1980 to 1987 to shut it down with voter referendums on statewide ballots; each time about 60 percent of voters favored keeping the plant open. Leaders of the Maine Nuclear Referendum Committee, an antinuclear group based in Portland that has led the campaign to close Maine Yankee, said today that since last July the plant has been shut down nine times because of unexpected problems. ""We feel very strongly that what we're dealing with is an aging nuclear reactor that is beginning to show its age,"" Thomas Coffin, a spokesman for the group, said. Residents of Wiscasset say the plant has been a good neighbor, a good employer and a supplier of about 90 percent of the local tax base. Of the plant's 420 employees, many come from Wiscasset, which has a population of about 3,400. ""Until they come up with a better alternative, I support its being here,"" said Robert Rogers, who lives less than a mile from the plant. ""It does pump quite a lot of money into the economy here, and they've had a real good safety record."" The regulatory commission said that in the last several years the owners of Maine Yankee have received the Government's highest rating for operating the plant. Maine Yankee, which began operating commercially in 1972, is owned by 10 utility companies in New England, with the Central Maine Power Company having the largest share. The 825-megawatt plant was designed Combustion Engineering Inc., a nationally known engineering company in Stamford, Conn. It provides low-cost electric power to about one-fourth of the homes and businesses in Maine. Plant executives said today it was too early to determine when Maine Yankee would return to service. The generator and transformers sustained extensive damage, and the plant could be shut down for weeks if not months. But the shutdown will not cause a shortage in power, they said, because hydroelectric power is plentiful this time of year. The regulatory commission sent a team of experts Monday night to investigate the causes of the explosion and fire and determine how well the plant's operators and its automatic systems responded.",1991-05-01T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

But this month, the Vietnamese Government announced that it was considering a proposal from South Korea to build two nuclear reactors here at a cost of $3 billion. Vietnam is one of the few Asian nations blessed by large deposits of fossil fuel -- it has huge tracts of offshore oil -- but its leaders are eager not to be left behind in the nuclear-power binge sweeping Asia. Nuclear power is an industry in crisis in the West, the result both of the panic produced by the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl and of the multi-billion-dollar cost overruns that have plagued nuclear-energy projects throughout Europe and the United States. No new nuclear plants have been ordered in the United States since 1979. But if the nuclear-energy genie is dying in the West, he is being reborn in Asia. The booming, fuel-hungry nations across the region are ordering and building nuclear plants at a rate not seen in decades. Fail-Safe? There are already 115 commercial and research reactors in operation in East Asia, most in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China. In the next decade, dozens of new reactors are expected to built across the continent at a cost of more than $100 billion. Asian leaders say they have no choice but to develop nuclear power given the explosive rate at which the demand for energy is growing. The International Atomic Energy Agency has predicted that power demands in Asia will triple by 2015. But while reactors may power Asia's thriving economies into the next century, they also pose problems of safety and cost that the West has been tangling with unsuccessfully throughout the atomic age. It is a subject now under scrutiny at the United Nations, where diplomats opened talks last week on extending the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The 25-year-old treaty, which is about to expire, was designed to limit the spread of nuclear arms in part by allowing inspection of power plants to verify that atomic material is not diverted to weapons use. But evidence from North Korea has shown that a determined government could use civil nuclear programs as a cover for weapons development, and the spread of nuclear power in Asia has raised new concerns about proliferation. Anti-nuclear advocates are dismayed. ""It's the first world dumping old, dangerous technology on the developing world,"" said Jean McSorley, who directs anti-nuclear campaigns in Asia for Greenpeace. ""We're encouraging them to repeat the same mistakes that we made."" Environmental groups say they take little solace from the fact that most of the plants now being built in Asia are of Western design, and that they incorporate hard-earned lessons about safety. They have called on Asian nations to shun atomic energy in favor of conservation and the use of safer energy sources. Solar energy, they say, would be a natural choice in much of sun-baked Southeast Asia. No Asian nation has embraced nuclear energy more enthusiastically than China, which opened its first commercial complex only last year but has plans for 30 more reactors. Last month, it announced a shifting in national energy policy to encourage the development of nuclear power over hydropower and thermal energy, the priorities until now. ""We are energetically developing nuclear power,"" said Yao Qiming, a government energy official. ""It is our future."" Western companies are rushing in with proposals to build reactors. In January, China awarded three French firms a $3 billion contract to build two nuclear plants in Guangdong Province. Few in the industry were surprised when the chairmen of Westinghouse and General Electric, both of which design or build nuclear plants, showed up in Beijing last year for talks. ""The energy growth in Asia is just astonishing, and their move to nuclear energy shows that the nations of Asia understand the value of having a mix of energy resources -- and the value of nuclear energy,"" said Angie McBrien of the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobbying group. But if the Clinton Administration is eager to see American companies benefit from the development of atomic power in China, it has been dismayed by what has gone on in North Korea, the nation that more than any in Asia had proved the dangers of the unrestrained nuclear development. Temptations Until last year, North Korea appeared bent on using spent fuel from a reactor to make weapons-grade plutonium. Under an agreement with the United States, the plant is to be shut down in return for safer reactors designed to limit the risk of diversion. Negotiations to implement that agreement have been on-again, off-again. At the same time, some critics fear that other Asian countries that until now have disavowed ambitions for nuclear arms may be tempted to reconsider. ""My worst-case scenario is that every country in the region would get a couple of reactors with the idea that they want to keep their military options open,"" said Ms. McSorley of Greenpeace. The options are wide open in India and Pakistan, both of which have diverted nuclear material from power plants to the making of weapons that they might use against one another. Unlike most Asian nations, neither India nor Pakistan has signed the non-proliferation pact. In Southeast Asia, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia are all in varying stages of nuclear development. Indonesia is about to take bids for its first nuclear plant. The governments of South Korea, Japan and Taiwan already support some of the world's most sophisticated nuclear-power programs. In South Korea, nuclear power provides more than 40 percent of all the electricity generated in the country; in Japan and Taiwan, the figure is about 30 percent. The Japanese Government has proposed the construction of at least 15 new nuclear reactors by 2010, and it is now pursuing the commercial use of fast-breeder reactors, which use plutonium for fuel. The rush to nuclear power would not be so worrying if Asian leaders could guarantee that they would remain at peace. Since the Vietnam War, Asians have enjoyed a remarkable neighborliness. One reason for the region's economic success is that most governments have not been forced to spend a crippling portion of their budget on arms. But military historians say it is only a matter of time before the collegiality of the region breaks down. In just the last few weeks, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have all raised the threat of military action over the potentially oil-rich Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, after China built a military-style platform atop a tiny reef. Asian diplomats have been alarmed by the recent dispute between two old strategic allies, the Philippines and Singapore, which came close to a diplomatic split over the execution in Singapore of a Filipino maid. Tension Worried, Japanese scholars and nuclear experts have proposed a pan-Asian agreement to police recycling of nuclear material and prevent military diversions. Diplomats in the region have embraced the idea. Proponents say an accord may be essential as Asian nations are forced to cooperate in waste disposal. Some land-starved countries are already having trouble disposing of spent fuel -- South Korea expects to fill all its storage sites in a decade.

(Op-Ed, Jan. 9), Charles K. Ebinger correctly sounds the alarm over the public's attitude toward the drop in oil prices. We cannot stop planning for our energy future because the crunch at the gas pump has been temporarily eased. And indeed, the Reagan Administration has turned its back on America's energy future by cutting programs to develop ''renewable'' technologies and, more recently, by the President's veto of legislation requiring new appliances to be more energy-efficient. However, while Mr. Ebinger correctly characterizes current attitudes toward our future energy needs, his solution misses the mark. He says the Arab oil embargoes of 1973 and 1979 taught us to rely more heavily on our own energy sources -especially coal and uranium. However, conservation and energy-efficiency improvements, not nuclear power, proved the most appropriate mechanism for reducing our reliance on foreign oil. Since 1978, savings from improved energy efficiency have in effect supplied 23 percent of U.S. energy. Renewable energy sources contributed more new energy over the last decade than coal and nuclear energy combined, and currently provide twice as much primary energy as nuclear power. Furthermore, while nuclear power creates electricity, more than 90 percent of our oil is used for industry, automobiles and home heating. Those crucial functions cannot be subsumed by nuclear power. Mr. Ebinger cites the Chernobyl accident as a major contributor to nuclear industry woes. In reality, Chernobyl only slightly exacerbated the growing public dissatisfaction with nuclear power. Analysis of polling data shows a steady decline in public support for new nuclear construction. In 1975, 65 percent of the public supported building more nuclear power plants. But in early 1986, before the Chernobyl accident, nearly 70 percent opposed new nuclear plants. Much in the last 11 years has eroded public support - the Three Mile Island accident, the economic disaster of the Washington Public Power Supply System and thousands of ''incidents and accidents'' at plants each year. Besides the Chernobyl accident, 1986 was marked by cost overruns and significant safety incidents. For example, last December, during preoperational testing, valve malfunctions were discovered at the Nine Mile II plant in upstate New York. The cost to correct the problem is estimated at $240 million, bringing the total cost of the plant, originally set at $316 million, to $6 billion. Public and political support for nuclear power has eroded not because of the accident in the Ukraine but because of the industry's economic and safety record here at home. By perpetuating the myth that nuclear power is a viable alternative to oil imports, Mr. Ebinger does a disservice. The real lesson of the energy crisis of the 70's is that energy efficiency, not nuclear power, is the key to America's energy future.

However, I would like to present the other side of the public relations ploys and preachments of the United States Council of Energy Awareness on ''nuclear electricity and energy independence.'' Yes, on the global scale, nuclear power generation is growing. According to a recent study by the International Atomic Energy Agency, over the last 15 years, the annual growth rates in the fraction of electricity produced by nuclear have been 15 percent for industrialized countries, 28 percent for developing countries. Only in 1988, 14 new nuclear power reactors in eight countries were commissioned, bringing the world's total of operating plants to 429. At the end of 1988, 26 countries had nuclear power plants, with 105 more under construction. The increasing need for electrical energy, lack of local sources of energy, the specter of worrisome balance of payments and foreign debt caused by imported energy and, finally, fear of burning more fossil fuel and the resultant greenhouse effect will bring proliferation of nuclear power plants, at least for the near future. However, this trend could lead from the frying pan of the greenhouse effect into the fire of disastrous nuclear accidents, like the one at Chernobyl, near Kiev in the Soviet Union. The Chernobyl accident demonstrated for the first time that the effects of any such nuclear accident would not be localized, but would spill over into neighboring countries and have global consequences. The radioactive fallout from Chernobyl contaminated the milk supply of Sicily, 1,000 miles away. It is not simply, as the Council on Energy Awareness argues, design, small scale or such technology as automation that make a nuclear power plant safer. Technological systems accidents are caused by the way the engineered and human components interact. The safety of large-scale systems demands an approach to design and operation as attentive to human as to technical elements. To revive the atom and have safe nuclear plants, we need much more commitment, communication and cooperation among government and international agencies, plant manufacturers, utilities, unions and research communities. We need dedication by all parties, not rhetoric or public relations.

It was the latest in a series of Russian attacks on the country’s critical energy infrastructure in recent days.

The country is expected to outline a new energy policy, prompted by the disaster at Fukushima, and one option the government has explored would phase out all nuclear power by 2030. Public anxiety over nuclear safety has helped keep all but two of Japan’s 50 remaining reactors offline, and the country’s nascent anti-nuclear movement has demanded an even more immediate shutdown. But energy prices would soar, the country would become dangerously dependent on Middle Eastern oil and its greenhouse gas emissions would surge if it went nuclear-free — especially if it did so immediately, said Naomi Hirose, president of the Tokyo Electric Power Company. And without a swift restart of the remaining reactors, the company’s finances, already crippled by compensation claims after the Fukushima disaster, would worsen further, he warned. “We understand that local residents might ask whether they are really all right with letting us operate nuclear reactors again after the accident,” he said. “But zero nuclear is a very dangerous option. We need to step back and think of the wider consequences of giving up nuclear power.” Tokyo Electric has not given up on winning local residents’ approval to reopen the two reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant that survived the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, as well as four other reactors 16 kilometers (10 miles) away, Mr. Hirose said Wednesday. More urgent is the restarting of a third nuclear plant run by Tokyo Electric at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, about 124 miles from the Fukushima site on Japan’s northwest coast, he said. The governor of Niigata Prefecture, where that plant is situated, remains opposed to restarting any of the seven reactors. Mr. Hirose is part of a chorus of voices urging Japan not to turn away from nuclear power. Japan’s largest and most influential business lobby, the Nippon Keidanren, has also warned that a nuclear shutdown would create an energy shortage that would cripple economic growth. Japan once relied on nuclear power for about 30 percent of its electricity. Nuclear opponents have argued that Japan can make up for lost capacity by temporarily shifting to fossil fuels while the country races to expand alternative sources of energy. Japan made it through a sweltering summer with just two reactors running, they say — proof that the nation could do away with reactors altogether. But Mr. Hirose said power companies had averted blackouts this summer only by firing up old oil and natural gas stations and by importing fuel and generators at great cost. He said energy sources like solar and wind were still unreliable and would be feasible only with backup energy from conventional power stations like those that Tokyo Electric operates. “When people think of these new energy sources, they only think of best-case scenarios,” Mr. Hirose said. “But we have a responsibility to provide a cheap and stable source of power. We have to be realistic.” The company’s mission is to make sure that a nuclear accident never happens again, Mr. Hirose said.",2012-09-05T15:54:22.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-global-business

Lee, former chairman and chief executive of the Duke Power Company and a strong supporter of nuclear power, died on Wednesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center while visiting New York City from his home in Charlotte, N.C. He was 67. The cause was heart disease, said a spokesman for Duke Power, one of the nation's largest utilities, based in Charlotte. After the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania in March 1979 raised widespread concern about the future of nuclear power, Mr. Lee argued that the United States continue to support it. While the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission recommended that all power plants using the same kind of reactor as at Three Mile Island be closed for a time, he maintained that much had been learned about the reactors from the accident and that the plants should be allowed to keep operating. Mr. Lee, a native of Charlotte, graduated from Princeton University with a degree in civil engineering and joined Duke Power in 1955 as a junior engineer. He became president and chief operating officer in 1978. By then, Duke had largely completed construction of its nuclear plants, which were built at low cost and have since been a source of big profits for the utility. Mr. Lee was named chairman and chief executive in 1982. Under his leadership, the company continued to expand its nuclear generating capacity in the 1980's and created a division that helped other utilities build and run their own nuclear plants.

DESPITE the Chernobyl accident in 1986, in which 31 people died after a reactor exploded, the Soviet Union has clung to its ambitious plans for developing nuclear power. By the turn of the century, Soviet officials hope to double - to more than 20 percent - the percentage of electricity generated by nuclear reactors. But now, as a budding environmental movement is turning its attention to nuclear energy, it seems that the Russians are faced with their own rough equivalent of Seabrook, the embattled nuclear plant in New Hampshire. Last week, a Soviet newspaper reported that a letter-writing campaign by local residents had persuaded officials to abandon a nuclear power project near the Black Sea. About $41 million had already been spent on development. According to the report, the plant, which was being built near the city of Krasnodar, is the victim of a growing opposition to nuclear power, which has become widespread since the explosion at Chernobyl forced the evacuation of 100,000 residents and contaminated farmlands. ''The situation today is not surprising,'' wrote the reporter for Komsomolskaya Pravda, the newspaper for the Young Communists' League. ''We have read about the anti-nuclear demonstrations in other countries . . . and about the fears connected with this in the United States.'' The newspaper argued that abandoning the plant would result in an electricity shortage in the region, while the alternative to nuclear reactors - coal-fired generating plants - would bring pollution. The paper blamed the opposition on the protesters' ''elementary ignorance about nuclear power.'' Having a nuclear power plant was once ''profitable - and also prestigious,'' the paper lamented. ''But then the entire world started talking about Chernobyl.'' IDEAS & TRENDS",1988-01-31T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,week-in-review

To the Editor: Re “ Nuclear Power Can Save the World ,” by Joshua S. Goldstein, Staffan A. Qvist and Steven Pinker (Sunday Review, April 7): Will it take another Chernobyl or Fukushima, possibly in an American city, to quiet the disinformation coming from nuclear activists? What the world needs is energy that is both carbon-free and radiation-free. Those of us who live near a failed nuclear power plant know the truth: Nuclear power is by far the most expensive, the most dangerous, the most unreliable and the most environmentally unfriendly form of energy production. Roger Johnson San Clemente, Calif. To the Editor: The authors write: “Today, renewables work only with fossil-fuel backup .” How am I going to break this news to the batteries that are handily backing up our solar array? As a dry run for hurricane season, I turned off the utility power to our house for a week. We lived our normal life, running the central air-conditioner, charging our electric car, and doing a lot of laundry with the electric washer and dryer. Some days were sunny, some were cloudy, but we never ran out of power. Even our formerly solar-averse utility is starting to replace gas-burning power plants with solar plus battery storage. As George Bernard Shaw noted, “People who say it cannot be done should not interrupt those who are doing it .” Philip K. Stoddard South Miami The writer is the mayor of South Miami. To the Editor: I recently retired after working more than 40 years in the nuclear power industry. I was involved in the design, licensing, construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants. The points made are well articulated and reasonable. Unfortunately, these are the same messages that have been repeated for the past decades. The United States’ nuclear power plant supply chain has been deteriorating for years because of the lack of new reactor orders. What is needed is a national energy policy that designates nuclear power as a strategic energy source. It deserves the same commitment that the Apollo program did, from conception to fulfillment. We just need the will to make it work. Leo Lessard Clinton, Mass. To the Editor: I am surprised the authors downplayed the problem of nuclear waste. “Over time” it becomes less radioactive? That time period can be tens of thousands of years. Also, countries throughout Europe are switching away from nuclear to renewable energy. Still, the authors make an interesting case for nukes. Kevin Dougherty Quebec City To the Editor: I will support nuclear power the day after the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act is repealed. If insurance company actuaries consider nuclear power to be so dangerous that they cannot compute premiums that the industry can afford, then that industry is not economically viable. If the government (i.e., taxpayers) has to cover the industry with catastrophic insurance, then the government should own the reactors and provide nonprofit energy. We were lucky at Three Mile Island. We were minutes away from a complete meltdown that given the plant’s location would have killed thousands and done billions in damage. Investigations of Three Mile Island showed that, like the Deepwater Horizon disaster, extremely dangerous processes cannot be allowed to remain in control of people whose first responsibility is profit or return to shareholders.

Some are building new reactors as fast as they can. They are coming from everywhere in Australia; shirt-sleeved workers from every corner of the continent heading to a remote stretch of the South Australian desert. There is no water, and not much of anything else either. But the Olympic Dam mine is located here. And the mine is hiring. The company currently employs about 700 miners, who have already dug several kilometers of tunnels under the desert. The area is so bone dry that drinking water must be pumped through a system of pipes from a distant spring. Recently, there has even been talk of building a desalination plant. After all, uranium mining requires water -- lots of it -- and Australia wants to remain the world's second largest supplier after Canada. The explanation for the government's enthusiasm for nuclear power can be found in a report by nuclear physicist and former IT manger Ziggy Switkowski. As if on cue, he enthuses about the need for more nuclear power plants: Australia must start building reactors so that the first one can be completed in 2020. If a concerted effort is made, another 25 could be online by mid-century. On the one hand, this would help the country improve its poor record of carbon dioxide emissions. On the other, it would allow Australia to tap an almost inexhaustible source of energy; the country possesses more than 38 percent of the world's accessible uranium reserves. The international atomic energy lobby loves such talk. Almost 21 years after the Chernobyl disaster, and just a couple months after the most recent breakdown at Sweden's Forsmark reactor last July, the risks associated with nuclear power are largely fading into the background. So too are questions about the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and atomic weapons. The industry, in short, is preparing for a new boom. Plans for more nuclear plants Currently there are 435 atomic reactors generating electricity in 31 countries across the globe. They fill 6.5 percent of the world's total energy demand and use close to 70,000 tons of enriched uranium per year. Atomic plants produce one-sixth of the total electricity supply -- roughly on par with hydropower. That number may soon rocket upwards. At present, 29 nuclear power plants are under construction and there are concrete plans to build another 64. Another 158 are under consideration. On the other end of the equation, only six are slowly being shut down in preparation for decommissioning. In response to the growing demand, the price for uranium has increased seven-fold since 2002 and now sells for $72 per pound (454 grams). The fact that no final storage place exists for highly radioactive waste is considered to be but a secondary problem. Indeed, the only terminal repository apparently free from political opposition is that in Finland's Eurajoki where such a site is now under construction. There, nuclear waste will be stored at a maximum depth of 520 meters in shafts bored deep into the granite bedrock. The main obstacle to the construction of nuclear power plants is no longer the anti-nuclear power lobby, but the huge costs of building them. Whereas in 1970 a brand new reactor cost $400 million, a plant now runs as much as 10 times higher. In the last three decades the nuclear power industry has received subsidies of about $1 billion -- the electricity generated may be clean from a global warming point of view, but it's not cheap. Nonetheless, power plant construction companies are hoping for a renaissance. E.on has applied to build a new plant in Romania's Cernavoda and Siemens expects orders to triple in the next five years. General Electric too expects a number of new reactors to be built within the next decade, says Ferdinando Beccalli-Falco, a GE manager. Indeed, a lots of companies stand to benefit. The industry is celebrating the ""strategic shift"" and preparing for a boom with mergers en vogue. Japan's Toshiba has acquired US-based Westinghouse, General Electric is working together with Hitachi and Mitsubishi Heavy is flirting with the Franco-German global market leader Areva NP, in which Siemens holds a stake. Admiration of France Until now, France has been virtually alone in its reliance on nuclear technology: Eighty percent of its domestically produced power comes from nuclear plants. The 59 plants allow the country to be mostly self-sufficient, and now this strategy is once again being held up as an example. Lithuania, for example, urgently wants to replace its aging Ignalina nuclear reactor. Doing so would allow the country to decrease its dependence on Russia, but the price tag is some 3 billion. Ukraine also wants to build more nuclear power plants in order to increase its self-sufficiency, despite the trauma of Chernobyl. Bulgaria and the Czech Republic are both discussing building two new nuclear reactors each. Poland is considering building a nuclear plant after 2020 since its domestic coal-fired power plants could soon run afoul of EU regulations. Next year the EU wants to tighten the emissions requirements for such polluters. Sites under consideration include Gryfino and Klempicz near Posnan, both of which are close to the German border. Britain's Labour government wants to prepare the way for new atomic power plants by easing the approval process; many of its aging coal-fired power plants will have to close as a result of new EU standards. Gas-fired plants could help to close the gap, but Europe's two most important suppliers, Russia's Gazprom and Algeria's state-owned Sonatrach, in August signed an agreement that has aroused suspicions in London and Brussels that they will create a cartel similar to OPEC. EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso adroitly side-stepped the issue last Wednesday when announcing the EU's new energy strategy. Germany is joined by a number of other EU countries in their skepticism toward nuclear power. But he did not conceal his committee's sympathy for atomic power, citing both environmental reasons and issues related to securing Europe's energy supply. Canada and Australia, the two most significant uranium suppliers, are reliable partners. Other suppliers include Kazakhstan, Russia, Uzbekistan, Namibia and Niger. Kazakhstan wants to surpass Canada as the world's leading uranium supplier by 2010, which explains why French, Chinese and Japanese companies are racing to invest there. India is considering building 19 new reactors, while China wants to construct at least 63 facilities that will be able to supply 50 giga-watts of power. In emerging market Indonesia a single, very modest, nuclear reactor will go online in 2011. In contrast the US is talking about building more than 20 new plants after a 20-year construction moratorium. Washington is providing tax incentives for power plant operators and it also wants to ease the process of obtaining the required permits. But who is going to pay? President George W. Bush already enthuses about a ""Global Nuclear Energy Partnership"" to foster the use of nuclear power while also monitoring to ensure that the technology is not misused by North Korea, Iran or al-Qaida. The US has budgeted $250 million to support the partnership, and the Hill & Knowlton public relations company, which worked for the government during the first Gulf war, has already launched a PR campaign to promote nuclear power. The need for advertising seems unavoidable, since even the most enthusiastic supporters of the new atomic era cannot deny that it brings with it the same old risks. No one can rule out a meltdown. And no one can guarantee that civilian nuclear research won't be misused. Furthermore, no one knows who is going to pay for all the new facilities. Moscow wants to build about 30 new reactors, in part because Gazprom doesn't want to sell natural gas on the domestic market at low prices. The Kremlin speculates that it will be able to obtain $30 billion from foreign investors to fund their construction, but this money is not likely to appear soon. President Putin has called for the former superpower to take a ""giant leap"" by expanding its nuclear energy sector, but at present it only has one factory capable of manufacturing turbines and reactors. Consequently, Russia can only build one new nuclear power plant every three years. On the other hand, Russia also wants to sell nuclear technology abroad at discount prices, charging roughly 30 percent less than France for its reactors. Despite the lofty ambitions and impressive figures, the fact remains that 1.6 billion people still do not have access to electricity, while 2.4 billion are forced to meet their energy needs with wood, straw or manure. In this respect, Steve Kidd, the director of strategy and research at London's World Nuclear Association, could be correct. In the nuclear industry, Kidd says, many such grandiose plans often turn out to be delusional.",2007-01-16T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-financial-desk

Still, like other survivors of the attacks here and in Hiroshima, he quietly accepted Japan’s postwar embrace of nuclear-generated power, believing government assurances that it was both safe and necessary for the nation’s economic rise. That was before this year’s disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in northern Japan confronted the survivors once again with their old nightmare: thousands of civilians exposed to radiation. Aghast at the catastrophic failure of nuclear technology, and outraged by revelations that the government and power industry had planted nuclear proponents at recent town hall-style meetings, the elderly atomic bomb survivors, dwindling in numbers, have begun stepping forward for the first time to oppose nuclear power. Now, as both Hiroshima and Nagasaki observe the 66th anniversary of the American atomic attacks at the end of World War II, the survivors are hoping that they can use their unique moral standing, as the only victims of nuclear bombings, to wean both Japan and the world from what they see as mankind’s tragedy-prone efforts to tap the atom. “Is it Japan’s fate to repeatedly serve as a warning to the world about the dangers of radiation?” said Mr. Hirose, 81, who was a junior high school student when an American bomb obliterated much of Nagasaki, killing about 40,000 people instantly. “I wish we had found the courage to speak out earlier against nuclear power.” But speaking out, even here, was no simple matter. It would have required them to challenge Japan’s postwar establishment, a difficult position in a consensus-driven nation that had put itself on a forced march out of devastation and toward economic development. Their stance also made some historical sense in a country bent on not repeating past mistakes. One of the reasons resource-poor Japan went to war in 1941 was to secure new sources of energy, in that case oil, after an American embargo. Even now, the pressure to adhere to what was the nation’s shared vision for energy security is strong. As Hiroshima observed the anniversary of the bombing, which killed at least 70,000 people there, the city’s mayor on Saturday stopped short of calling for an end to nuclear power, remarking instead that opinions were divided. “Some seek to abandon nuclear power altogether with the belief that mankind cannot coexist with nuclear energy, while others demand stricter regulation of nuclear power and more renewable energy,” said the mayor, Kazumi Matsui. According to Japanese news reports, the mayor, too young to have witnessed the attacks, had considered making a stronger statement in the wake of the Fukushima accident, but pulled back in the face of opposition by business groups. Such reluctance to speak out has made the stronger stance taken by the atomic bombings’ survivors all the more striking. Last month, the Hidankyo, the group representing the 50,000 or so still-living survivors of the bombings, appealed for the first time for Japan to eliminate civilian nuclear power. In its action plan for next year, the group called for halting construction of new nuclear plants and the gradual phasing out of Japan’s 54 current reactors as energy alternatives are found. The group has been a vocal advocate of abolishing nuclear weapons since its founding in 1956. But it has been mute until now on the issue of nuclear power, which Japan continued to pursue even after the accidents decades ago at Chernobyl in Ukraine and Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania led many Western nations to shelve nuclear expansion plans. “The bureaucracy, industry and the media were able to shut our eyes to the danger of nuclear power,” said Hirotami Yamada, secretary general of the Nagasaki chapter of Hidankyo. “We let them fool us, even in this country that was the victim of the atomic bomb.” Mr. Hirose, who lost his aunt in the Nagasaki attack, played a leading role in the group’s shift on nuclear power after Fukushima. He was swayed, in part, by his deep understanding of the fears haunting people exposed to radiation from Fukushima. His younger brother died 20 years after the bombing, in his 30s, while suffering from a half-dozen types of cancer. Those still alive, he said, “are living testimony to the horrors of radiation.” Mr. Yamada said many atomic bomb survivors, like other Japanese, accepted nuclear power because they had bought the argument put forward by the government, industry and the news media that Japan’s nuclear reactors were among the best in the world, and absolutely safe. This “safety myth,” as many here now call it, allowed Japanese authorities to dismiss concerns over Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, saying they were caused by poor technology or incompetent plant workers. Some atomic bombing survivors ruefully admit that it took a disaster the size of Fukushima to free them from that myth. “They convinced us that nuclear power was different from nuclear bombs,” said Mr. Yamada, 80, who was a teenager when Nagasaki was bombed. “Fukushima showed us that they are not so different.”",2011-08-06T21:42:31.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The proposal, which would remove 55-year-old restrictions on companies owning independent power-generating stations, does not explicitly mention nuclear reactors. And an extensive section in the strategy on promoting nuclear power makes no reference to the proposed change in who may build generating stations. Bypassing State Panels But the provision could help companies that want to build nuclear plants sidestep state public utility commissions. The commissions do not directly regulate independent power plants. ""It allows them to bypass pesky local and state regulators,"" said Gary L. Groesch of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a New Orleans consumer group. ""It's one of the foundations on which a new nuclear industry would be constructed."" Mr. Groesch opposes a revival of the nuclear industry and opposes the change. Standley D. Hoch, the chief executive of General Public Utilities, which owns reactors in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, said the change would ""certainly help"" a revival of nuclear power. Such a revival would also require a streamlining of licensing procedures, new reactor designs and other changes called for in the energy strategy, he said. So taken alone, he said, removing the ownership restrictions would not cause anyone to build a reactor. The construction of a reactor as an independent power plant, rather than as part of a traditional utility system, is one option under discussion in the nuclear industry, Mr. Hoch said. More Attractive Price General Public Utilities, which buys 25 percent of its supplies on the wholesale market, would be ready to purchase energy from a reactor rather than an independent producer powered by coal or natural gas, he said. ""We would look at the option based on the price of the power, not the technology,"" he said. Many of the companies that might be partners in such new plants are reluctant to endorse the change publicly, because most of those companies' business is with power utilities, which are deeply divided on the issue. Privately, however, some executives say such a change would make a revival of the nuclear industry more likely. At the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, John B. Yasinsky, executive vice president of the power systems group, said if Congress enacted the change, ""I don't see that as an overriding factor in bringing nuclear power back."" But, he added, the change would be helpful. Law Gives S.E.C. Authority At issue is a call to repeal the teeth of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, a law that gives the Securities and Exchange Commission jurisdiction over certain kinds of conglomerates that generate power, in the wake of financial scandals. The effect of the law has been to keep industrial companies out of the power business, and to keep utilities out of the business of building generating plants outside their territories and selling the power on the open market. Under the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978, scores of such plants have been built around the country. Repeal of the critical part of the 1935 law was debated by Congress last year. It is controversial within the utility industry for reasons that are unrelated to nuclear power; some utilities want the restriction lifted so they can build generating stations around the country, while others dislike such independent power plants in their areas and think a change in the act would encourage more of them. But if the act were repealed or substantially modified, experts say, it would allow ownership of reactors by some of the most enthusiastic proponents of a nuclear revival: the companies that once manufactured the components, designed the plants and managed their construction for utilities. Companies Owning Plants Westinghouse and the General Electric Company, for example, which between them manufactured the critical parts for all but a handful of the 110 commercial reactors in the United States, could then take an ownership position in reactors. Both are now spending heavily on preparing new designs for approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Architect-engineering firms that designed the plants and managed their construction could also take a share. Last year, Westinghouse and the Bechtel Group, an San Francisco engineering ceoncern, in a move widely interpreted as preparation for such an investment, agreed to buy a 19-year-old reactor, the Palisades plant in South Haven, Mich., from the Consumers Power Company. Bechtel also took an unusual role at a Pennsylvania reactor, Limerick 2, that would also represent a rehearsal for ownership: It agreed to finish construction with its payment based in part on how smoothly the job went. In previous nuclear construction management contracts, the managers got a fee independent of cost overruns or delays, or they were paid a fee that rose as more money was spent. A nuclear reactor built as an independent power plant would be regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has historically been far more generous to utility companies than state regulators, whose ranks include some of the leading opponents of new reactors. If reactors were built by huge, broadly based corporations instead of utilities, financing would be easier. Harvey Wasserman, the senior energy adviser at Greenpeace, the environmental advocacy group, said this would be a big advantage. He opposes the change. Financing Problems Investor-owned utilities would face problems financing new reactors, especially after the bankruptcy of the Public Service Company of New Hampshire in 1988 from cost overruns at its Seabrook nuclear plant. But not everyone is convinced that the change would help the nuclear industry. Dan Scotto, a senior vice president of the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation, said the change would encourage the construction of other kinds of power plants. These would be tough competition for nuclear reactors, he said, because they are smaller, allowing a better match of supply to demand, and because their risks are lower. Nuclear power, he said, ""is not the technology of first choice for utilities, whether as a hard asset or as a customer for the power.""",1991-03-05T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business

The problems were so acute that Federal regulators listed it as one of the nation's three worst-run nuclear plants. Now, three months after the plant resumed generating power, potentially dangerous management problems persist, according to Federal nuclear officials and the nuclear industry's own internal quality-control group, the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations. Although no incidents at the restarted reactor have directly threatened public safety, operators several times this summer ran the plant in ways that could increase the risk of an accident, Federal inspectors say. The most significant problem at the plant, on the east bank of the Hudson about 35 miles north of Manhattan, occurred in early July. The reactor was run for two days with its cooling system at a pressure lower than the permitted range, according to inspectors for the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which licenses nuclear plants. Federal inspectors said the problem lay not with the low-pressure operation -- which was most likely not dangerous -- but with the decision to take the plant into essentially uncharted waters by operating it in a way that had not been carefully studied. With Indian Point 3 and a neighboring plant, Indian Point 2, surrounded by more people than any other nuclear site in the country, there is no room for such errors, said Robert D. Pollard, a nuclear engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group that monitors nuclear plant performance. ""Ten percent of the population of the United States lives within 60 miles of Indian Point,"" Mr. Pollard said. When any complex system is run under conditions that have not been thoroughly analyzed, a cascade of unforeseen errors could result in catastrophe, he said. On Monday, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that conditions at the plant had improved enough since the summer that it decided not to impose a possible $50,000 fine on the New York Power Authority, Indian Point 3's owner, for the low-pressure incident. But the agency's regional administrator, Thomas T. Martin, said in a letter to the Power Authority, the nuclear agency remained ""concerned with the poor performance by your managers and staff prior to, during and in immediate response to the event."" Indian Point 2 is owned by Consolidated Edison. The Nuclear Regulatory Agency and the Power Authority planned to hold a briefing to update the public on plant conditions on Wednesday. Criticism of the New York Power Authority has also come from within the normally insular nuclear industry itself. William J. Cahill Jr., the chief nuclear officer for the Power Authority, acknowledged in an interview that the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, which acts as something of a nuclear ombudsman, providing confidential assessments of plants, sharply criticized lapses at the plant and training methods. But he emphasized that the industry group had even higher standards than the Federal Government. The most recent shutdown at Indian Point 3 lasted from February 1993 until July 19. The Power Authority replaced 19 of the plant's 27 top managers and claimed to have instituted among its 900 employees a new ""nuclear religion,"" ordering workers and supervisors to pay more attention to recommended procedure and to be more vigilant about identifying problems. But in an inspection report covering July and early August, Federal engineers noted a continued pattern at the plant of using a strict menu of operating procedures only as loose guidelines, with operators straying occasionally and then not promptly reporting these so-called ""deviation events."" The most serious incident occurred when workers lowered the pressure in the cooling system that sends water through the hot reactor in an effort to close a jammed valve, the report said. Mr. Cahill said the industry group was particularly critical of this decision. The normal procedure, he said, would be to stop the nuclear reaction in the core of the plant first, then try to close the valve. Conditions seem to be on the upswing at the plant, said Curtis J. Cowgill 3d, the director of nuclear plant inspections for the New York region at N.R.C. In its most recent inspection report, covering Aug. 8 to Sept. 18, the N.R.C. noted only one minor violation, he said. ""When a plant like this starts up, you don't expect everything to go perfectly,"" Mr. Cowgill said. ""We believe they're making a good faith effort but still need improvement.""",1995-10-18T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

The decision, which could open the plant's Unit 2 reactor within 10 days, was hailed today by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which owns and operates the reactor in northern Alabama, and by others in the nuclear power industry as a significant vote of confidence for the utility and the industry. The reactor has been shut for more than six years, the longest shutdown for repairs in the history of the American civilian nuclear power program. ""The restart of any plant after an extended outage is a sign of an industry where problems are corrected after they are brought to light,"" said Steve Unglesbee, a spokesman for the United States Council for Energy Awareness, a nuclear power industry trade group in Washington. Critics of nuclear power denounced the action, saying that the regulatory agency exempted Browns Ferry, just outside Athens, Ala., from a number of crucial safety guidelines, most having to do with the plant's ability to fight fires. They noted that on Monday, a fire and explosion shut a nuclear power plant in Maine indefinitely. The accident occurred in a transformer and generator at the plant and did not release any radiation to the public. Although there have been no new orders for nuclear power plants in 17 years, many operators, including the T.V.A., have indicated that they would like to build new plants this decade. The Bush Administration has begun an aggressive nuclear program within the Department of Energy aimed at designing a standard type of reactor that would be almost immune from meltdown. It also wants to streamline licensing of new plants. The Administration has said it believes nuclear power is safe and produces less pollution than conventional power plants. The pollution argument is beginning to gain ground even among some environmentalists, who have generally opposed nuclear power but who increasingly view conventional power plants as heavy contributors to global warming and acid rain. New Design Being Studied The Administration says one new reactor design being considered by the Energy Department for producing materials for nuclear weapons can also be applied to generating electrical power. The design under consideration would consist of four small reactors using tiny uranium pellets for fuel and would be cooled by hydrogen. Records from the N.R.C. also show that 12 years after the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant near Harrisburg, Pa., utilities have improved operations at nuclear plants. Commercial nuclear power plants are experiencing fewer unplanned shutdowns, fewer accidents and incidents, and are more reliable than ever, the agency says. The number of unplanned shutdowns dropped to an average of 1.6 per plant in 1990 from 7.4 in 1980, according to the N.R.C. How important these improvements are in swaying public opinion in favor of nuclear power remains to be seen. Some environmentalists say that the mining, milling, and processing of uranium for fuel is a dirty and ecologically dangerous business. The Government also has been unable to reach a safe and permanent solution for disposing of dangerous radioactive wastes. Staking Their Futures Nevertheless, large utilities, especially the T.V.A., are again beginning to stake their futures on generating electrical power from the atom. ""The decision today was a substantial milestone for this company,"" said Dan A. Nauman, T.V.A.'s senior vice president for nuclear power. ""We worked so hard to get here. Since 1985, people have been working seven days a week to get to this point."" Political leaders in Alabama were pleased. State Representative Bobby Denton, a Democrat who lives about 40 miles from the plant, said: ""It's great news for the Tennessee Valley region to be close to seeing the plant finally begin producing electricity again. Hopefully, Browns Ferry can now become the model program it was expected to be from the start."" Mayor Eddie Frost of Florence said: ""Federal regulators would not allow the unit to be started again if there was a great risk. I'm confident all the problems have been solved."" Florence is about 30 miles west of Athens. Indeed, many residents of Alabama seem unalarmed, even uninterested. ""To most people it seems like a done deal,"" said Pat Byington, executive director of the Alabama Conservancy, an environmental group in Birmingham. ""Nobody is talking about it very much."" Early, Heady Days Recalled The Browns Ferry plant was once the world's largest commercial nuclear plant, a symbol of the atom's intoxicating power. Built at a cost of $1 billion, its first reactor opened in 1974. Two more followed in 1975 and 1977, generating 1,100 megawatts each. The Browns Ferry plant was seen by T.V.A. as the cornerstone of an empire of 17 nuclear power plants the utility planned to build across the South at a cost of tens of billions of dollars. But soon after it opened, Browns Ferry also became a symbol of the capricious perils of nuclear energy. In March 1975, while the plant was operating at peak power, a workman searching with a candle for an air leak in the plant's cable room accidentally ignited a fire that caused more than $100 million in damage. The fire, which burned below the control room and nearly led to a catastrophe, was one of the worst civilian nuclear power accidents in the United States. Over the next decade, a series of investigations by the N.R.C. and other agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, uncovered significant weaknesses in the design, management and operation of Browns Ferry and its sister, the Sequoyah nuclear plant north of Chattanooga, Tenn., which opened in 1981. Three Mile Island Shock The inquiries, coupled with higher operating costs and the public uneasiness prompted by the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island, caused the T.V.A. nuclear program to collapse in the mid-1980's. Browns Ferry and Sequoyah were closed. Work on two other nuclear plants ceased. The adventure in nuclear power cost the T.V.A. at least $20 billion and nearly bankrupted the utility. T.V.A. executives defended their decision to develop a nuclear power program as vital to the economic growth of the utility and the region it served. In 1988, after an expensive repair program, the T.V.A. gained permission from the N.R.C. to restart both reactors at the Sequoyah plant. The repair program at Browns Ferry has been more expensive, costing more than $1.3 billion to date. Unit 2 must undergo several more tests before final permission is granted by the N.R.C. administrator in Atlanta to restart it. Mr. Nauman said Unit 3 could be restarted in 1994 and Unit 1 sometime before the end of the decade. The N.R.C. said Browns Ferry was the last nuclear plant left in the United States to restart after an extended shutdown. Four others have been restarted after long shutdowns since 1985. ""It was kind of a black eye for the nuclear industry that Browns Ferry was down,"" said Mr. Nauman. ""Bringing it back on line means it has been brought to today's standard of operation. This plant will produce electricity for a long time."" Critics of the industry said today that the N.R.C. appeared to be especially lenient in its consideration of Browns Ferry. The T.V.A. sought, and the four-member commission specifically granted, an exemption for Browns Ferry from several fire-safety requirements that were made into law as a result of the 1975 accident at the plant. For instance, the commission ordinarily requires nuclear plants to have automatic fire-suppression equipment in backup control rooms. Browns Ferry, though, will be able to use fire extinguishers. The N.R.C. rules also ordinarily requires fire-fighting equipment for key pumps. Browns Ferry will not need to have the fire-fighting equipment, according to commission documents, because the T.V.A. felt that if a fire developed near the pumps it would not burn for very long. ""These exemptions are authorized by law and will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety,"" the N.R.C. wrote. Several groups today said they were upset with the exemptions and the decision to restart Browns Ferry. ""It is ironic that here is the plant that had a fire in March 1975 that led to these rules and now they are granted exemptions to fire-protection regulations,"" said Robert D. Pollard, the nuclear safety engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington.

Here is a sampling. The Letter To the Editor: On Feb. 9 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted to license two new nuclear plants in Georgia , raising two questions: Do we need nuclear power? Can we build safe nuclear plants? The answer to both is yes! The world’s energy needs are growing. By midcentury the world’s population is expected to be nine billion, nearly 30 percent more than today’s. More important, the push by developing countries to increase their standard of living is inexorably tied to a corresponding increase in energy consumption. World electricity consumption by midcentury will probably be between two and four times what it is today. And our aging power plants will have to be replaced before then. This enormous demand for new generating capacity must be met while also containing global warming and minimizing pollution and other environmental damage. But how? Solar and wind energy are nowhere near ready to take on this kind of load. Coal, oil and gas are polluters and major carbon dioxide generators — hence major contributors to global warming. Oil and gas also have geopolitical issues. Nuclear power is the only major electricity source that is both ready and does not contribute to global warming. There is no question that nuclear plants must be built with the highest regard to safety. Modern nuclear plant designs therefore incorporate greatly enhanced safety features that, for example, allow a reactor to shut down and cool itself by natural forces like gravity and natural circulation, without external electrical power. Fukushima could not happen in these plants. We need all the electricity sources we can get. Let’s not exclude clean and safe nuclear energy. ZVI J. DORON Pittsburgh, Feb. 21, 2012 The writer is a retired nuclear engineer and a co-author of a book (in German) about energy and climate policies.  Readers React Nuclear power is the most expensive technological failure of the modern age. Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima top the list of its negatives. But in strict economic terms, it cannot compete. Solar, wind, geothermal, hydro and other forms of green power are cheaper, cleaner, safer, faster to build, require no federal limits on liability and create no radioactive waste. The same is true of increased efficiency and conservation. It’s time to recognize reality and leave atomic energy behind. HARVEY WASSERMAN Bexley, Ohio, Feb. 22, 2012 The writer is the author of “Solartopia! Our Green-Powered Earth.”  I am writing in strong support of Mr. Doron’s letter identifying nuclear energy as the only clean and reliable answer to the world’s future energy needs. It is the only nonpolluting energy source that can provide the steady base needs of the power grid into the future. As he says, the modern nuclear plants as approved for Georgia are passively safe, requiring no operator intervention to shut down in an emergency. One design, the Generation IV Integral Fast Reactor, goes even further in providing an answer to the waste problem through recycling and use of all the energy available in the fuel. Modern reactors are being built overseas in many countries. If the United States is to be a major player in the world’s energy future, we must advance our nuclear power programs as quickly as possible. LINWOOD L. LEE Jr. Stony Brook, N.Y., Feb. 22, 2012 The writer is professor emeritus of physics at Stony Brook University.  Mr. Doron is correct that long-term economic growth requires investment in new generating capacity while curbing traditional and global warming pollutants. But increasing reliance on nuclear power is one of the costliest ways to achieve that goal. The price tag for a new nuclear reactor is the biggest obstacle. Wall Street won’t finance one unless taxpayers co-sign, and the nuclear industry tried and failed to obtain more than $100 billion in federal loan guarantees. Skyrocketing construction cost estimates and the lack of financing — coupled with falling natural gas and renewable technology prices — mean that it is highly unlikely that more than a handful will be built in the United States over the next two decades. Finally, Mr. Doron’s contention that new nuclear reactor designs “incorporate greatly enhanced safety features” is contradicted by the fact that the design selected for the two new reactors in Georgia, the Westinghouse AP1000, has a weaker containment, less redundancy in safety systems, and fewer safety features than current reactors. It is too soon to judge whether the industry and its regulators have learned from their mistakes. In the meantime, let’s go forward with energy efficiency and renewables. They cost less and don’t generate waste that remains dangerously radioactive for thousands of years. ELLEN VANCKO Washington, Feb. 22, 2012 The writer is project manager for nuclear energy and climate change at the Union of Concerned Scientists.  Assuming that Mr. Doron’s assertion that modern nuclear power plants can be operated safely is accurate, he leaves two important questions unanswered. First, how can we safely dispose of the spent fuel rods? And how can the world monitor the enrichment of uranium to the level needed for power plants, but insufficient for nuclear weapons? Although construction of safe nuclear power plants may be feasible, and may help meet rising energy needs in the short term, ignoring the longer term implications of nuclear power may lead to even bigger problems. CRAIG V. VANSANDT Carlisle, Pa., Feb. 22, 2012  Mr. Doron is right that nuclear technology is ready and does not cause global warming, but he is wrong not to mention the problems of unresolved waste storage, earthquakes, exposure to cyber and regular terrorism or the potential concentration of the fuel for military use. He is right that the new Westinghouse design of the reactors approved for Georgia, with its gravity-based natural water circulation, is a step in the right direction, but he is wrong to imply that this is enough. The key safety problem is manual operation. If the Fukushima reactors were automatically flooded as soon as the earthquake was detected, not manually and only several hours after the tsunami hit, there would have been no accident. And Mr. Doron is wrong about renewable energy! In only a couple of years, all the roofs of new buildings could be covered by solar instead of regular shingles and could be provided with bidirectional meters to guarantee the continuous availability of electricity and the creation of millions of jobs. Yes, Mr. Doron is right that our aging nuclear plants have to be shut down, but he is wrong to suggest that we can afford to build new ones or that solar energy is not ready to take over. It is, and it is not only safe, clean and inexhaustible, but also a fuel that is free. BÉLA LIPTÁK Stamford, Conn., Feb. 22, 2012 The writer is an industrial safety consultant. The Writer Responds The writers’ replies range from full support to total rejection of nuclear power, with tacit agreement on one point: no expressed desire to see fossil fuels in our energy future. Yet coal and gas produce 70 percent of our electricity, and total demand is growing. It remains up to nuclear and renewable energies to fill the gap. Some of the concerns of Mr. VanSandt and others are red herrings. Enrichment of uranium to bomb grade is unrelated to civilian nuclear power; see Iran’s centrifuges. Disposal of spent fuel is a political, not a technical, issue; Nevadans don’t want the Yucca Mountain waste repository, just as Cape Codders don’t want wind turbines off “their” shore. And the AP1000’s safety is enhanced by fewer active components, not compromised as Ms. Vancko suggests. Construction cost overruns notwithstanding, most nuclear power plants produce electricity at competitive costs. Modern designs are modular, smaller and quicker to build (less interest costs), thus further improving economics. The advantages of renewables are a given. But solar and wind together now produce less than 2.5 percent of our electricity, forecast by the federal government to grow to 3.5 percent by 2035 — a far cry from Mr. Lipták’s vision of solar shingles on every roof “in only a couple of years.” Hydropower remains steady at 6 percent. This is no “Solartopia” (to borrow from Mr. Wasserman’s book title). Both nuclear and renewables are clean, noncarbon electricity generators that should be supported, but the vision that renewables alone can do the job in the next few decades is wishful thinking. Nuclear power is ready; let’s not get caught short. ZVI J. DORON Pittsburgh, Feb. 23, 2012",2012-02-25T23:47:17.000+01:00,NYTIMES,letters-opinion-sunday-review

Nuclear operators have been near-pariahs throughout much of the developed world since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, especially in Europe. No new reactors have been built in Western Europe since then, and several countries have declared themselves forever nuclear-free, including Italy, which shut the plants it had already built. The industry has survived only because countries like Germany and France are already too heavily dependent on nuclear energy to scrap it. Even so, operators have tended to keep their profile as low as possible. Now, Europe has bumped up against the limits of its existing power supply, and the Continent faces tough choices about energy. The torrid summer of 2003 and the deaths and illnesses it caused, particularly in countries like France, where air-conditioning is relatively uncommon, have prompted industry analysts to forecast sharp growth in electricity use. But there are a host of constraints on the expansion of the power supply. The 15 members of the European Union have committed themselves to sharp reductions in their emissions of ''greenhouse'' gases linked to global warming, notably carbon dioxide, and fossil-fuel-burning power plants are a significant source of those emissions. Most of Western Europe's potential for new large-scale hydropower development has already been tapped, and countries like Germany and Denmark invested in wind turbines only to discover during the unusually hot, still summer that the wind may not always blow when it is most needed. That, the nuclear operators say, leaves only one good option: new reactors. Because nuclear plants emit almost no greenhouse gases or other pollutants, industry advocates say, they may be the only way Europe can reliably add to its power generation capacity within the environmental constraints of the Kyoto treaty on global warming. Critics have long derided that argument, pointing out that it ignores the problems of radioactive waste, the greenhouse gas emissions and other pollution associated with mining and refining uranium, and the heightened safety and security concerns after the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Also, the European heat wave exposed a previously overlooked vulnerability: the rivers that supply the water used to cool many of the Continent's nuclear plants warmed up so much that plant managers had to choose between cutting back power output or releasing damagingly hot water back into the rivers. In an effort to soften widespread public hostility to nuclear power, industry leaders who gathered here this month announced the creation of a network of leading research centers and nuclear experts in 30 countries to be called the World Nuclear University. The intention is to promote scholarship and encourage students to pursue careers in nuclear science, and help to ''build the political will for a clean energy transformation,'' said John Ritch, director general of the World Nuclear Association, a London-based industry group that is one of four organizations sponsoring the initiative. The sponsors have enlisted Hans Blix, the former United Nations weapons inspector and a former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, to be the first leader of the network. Mr. Blix emphasized the danger of global warming in a speech at the London conference. ''While I would be the last to underestimate the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, I think the environmental risks we face are even greater,'' he said. Mr. Blix's caution is understandable, given the passions that nuclear energy arouses in Europe, for and against, often in close proximity. France depends on nuclear reactors, 59 of them, for more than three-quarters of its electricity, and while it has not added a reactor since the year of Chernobyl, it has resisted calls to curtail their use. Austria and Denmark have forsworn any use of nuclear energy, but Finland's Parliament approved plans last year to build a fifth reactor in the country. Construction has not begun, but the industry views the decision as evidence of a sea change in attitudes in a prosperous, environmentally conscious country. Eastern Europe, meanwhile, has plunged ahead, with plants under construction in Slovakia, Romania, Ukraine and Russia and proposals on the table in Bulgaria and Lithuania. The Romanian government wants to quadruple the share of the country's total power output provided by nuclear power, and sell the excess to its neighbors, according to Mircea Metes, business development manager at the state-owned utility Nuclearelectrica, who spoke at the London conference. Eastern enthusiasm for nuclear power has caused some friction with the West. For example, Austrians have tried unsuccessfully to force the Czech Republic to shut down its Temelin nuclear plant, 40 miles from the Austrian border, on safety grounds, and the plant may become an issue in the talks over Czech membership in the European Union. Nuclear industry officials say the new plants being built in Eastern Europe are vastly improved over Chernobyl both in terms of safety and efficiency. But no matter how well designed a nuclear power plant may be, environmentalists say, it still produces waste -- 25 to 30 tons of high-level waste a year for a large plant, and a good deal more low-level waste. ''They give us the choice between plague or cholera -- either global warming or nuclear waste,'' said Michaele Hustedt, a spokeswoman for the Green Party in Germany. The Greens demanded and won a promise that nuclear plants would be phased out in Germany when they joined the Social Democrats to form a ruling majority in 1998. So far, though, there is talk of shutting just one plant, near Hamburg, which is owned by the Swedish utility Vattenfall. Sweden and Belgium have adopted similar policies, but only Sweden has actually closed a reactor. Meanwhile, voters in Switzerland, another country with a strong environmental movement, rejected a phase-out in a referendum this spring. While nuclear energy will continue to supply much of Western Europe's electricity, analysts say, a rapid expansion is about as unlikely as a rapid phase-out. Part of the reason is cost. ''There are other solutions to global warming that should be pursued first at a much, much lower cost,'' said Rob Lake of Henderson Global Investors, which manages $152 billion in assets. ''First, there's energy conservation, then renewables, then cleaner conventional fuels, and only then would you start thinking about nuclear energy.'' Like the United States, Europe has privatized much of its electric power infrastructure, and that has opened operators to pressure from shareholders, including investors who may disapprove of nuclear energy, Mr. Lake said. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology this summer found that over the lifetime of a power plant, nuclear energy costs 6.7 cents a kilowatt-hour, compared with 4.2 cents for coal or natural gas (assuming moderate gas prices). A carbon emissions tax, as contemplated by the Kyoto treaty, would make nuclear far better by comparison, the study said. ''The ultimate costs will depend on both societal choices and technology developments,'' the study found. Analysts say there are lessons to be learned from Britain, where the first nuclear plant to supply substantial amounts of electricity to a national grid opened in 1956. Since then the country's nuclear industry has run into deep trouble. In June, British Energy, owner of eight of Britain's plants and part of the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, said it would take a $7 billion write-down for the 2002 fiscal year, mainly to cover costs from decommissioning its older nuclear plants. ''I don't think we're going to see anyone in Britain making a commitment to nuclear in the foreseeable future, because of what happened at British Energy,'' said Fraser McLaren, an analyst at ING in Edinburgh. The country's nuclear waste reprocessing industry is also on the brink of being shut because of safety concerns. In the United States, the nuclear industry tried to ally itself with environmentalists in the 1990's, with little success. Claims in a 1998 ad campaign that nuclear power made electricity without polluting or damaging the environment drew criticism and were found to be unsubstantiated by the Federal Trade Commission. No nuclear plants have been started in America since the near-meltdown at Three Mile Island in 1979, but there, too, several power companies have said they are considering proposals to build new reactors.",2003-09-18T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business
9120ef0c-dc27-4194-8c9b-71787fee3393,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/31/world/europe/31germany.html,"In Reversal, Germany Announces Plans to Close All Nuclear Plants by 2022","BERLIN — The German government on Monday announced plans to shut all of the nation’s nuclear power plants within the next 11 years, a sharp reversal for Chancellor Angela Merkel after the Japanese disaster at Fukushima caused an electoral backlash by voters opposed to reliance on nuclear energy. The plan calls for phasing out all of Germany’s 17 nuclear reactors — eight of which are offline — and expanding the use of renewable resources. The decision was based on recommendations of an expert commission appointed after the Japanese disaster to study an industry that generates 23 percent of Germany’s electricity. “It’s definite — the latest end for the last three nuclear plants is 2022,” said Norbert Röttgen, the environment minister. The announcement, which still faces legislative approval, was applauded by environmentalists and expected to be popular among voters. But it was greeted skeptically around Europe and within German industry. Some predicted it could harm economic growth, force Germany to import nuclear power from France, or even inflate the cost of energy across the continent. “The German decision has direct implications for Europe’s energy sector,” said Georg Zachmann, an energy expert at Bruegel, a research institute in Brussels. For Mrs. Merkel, the embrace of clean energy represents a transformation based on the politics of the ballot box. Just last year, her center-right coalition forced through an unpopular plan to extend the life of nuclear power plants, with the last to close in 2036. That action inflamed public opinion but the Fukushima disaster politicized it. The nuclear crisis is widely believed to have caused Mrs. Merkel’s party to lose control of the German state of Baden-Württemberg for the first time in 58 years, in a March election that became a referendum on energy policy. By Monday, Mrs. Merkel said the country must “not let go the chance” to end its dependence on nuclear power. But her ambitious plan will not be easily achieved. The cost of plugging the gap left by the nuclear shutdown is likely to raise power costs, particularly for Germany’s globally competitive industrial sector, which consumes nearly half of the total electricity supply. Germany hopes to have renewable sources provide 35 percent of its electricity by 2020, up from about 13 percent today, and reach 80 percent by 2050. Its efforts will be watched closely, analysts said. “If the government goes ahead with what it said it would do, then Germany will be a kind of laboratory for efforts worldwide to end nuclear power in an advanced economy,” said Mark Hibbs, a senior associate in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. “No other country in the world is taking those steps.” Switzerland — a much smaller nation — decided this month to abandon plans to build new nuclear reactors and will phase out its existing plants when they reach the end of their normal lives. Other European countries are standing by their nuclear programs, including France, which has 58 nuclear plants and two under construction. The Netherlands, deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, intends to build new nuclear plants along with developing more renewable energy sources. Britain has no plans to reduce its dependence on nuclear power. Poland, which is eager to reduce its dependence on Russian gas and oil, is committed to pursuing a nuclear energy program, despite the expense, according to recent statements by Prime Minister Donald Tusk. The government’s decision drew criticism and concern from some political and business leaders. The powerful Federal Association for German Industry, known as B.D.I., sent a letter on Monday morning to the chancellery, warning her about the consequences for German business. “How will the international competitiveness of German industry be guaranteed?” Hans-Peter Keitel, B.D.I.’s president, wrote. “Industry last year accounted for two-thirds of Germany’s economic upswing.” The government said all of the details of the phase-out had not yet been decided. If the government concludes that there are not sufficient alternative sources of energy to make up for the loss of nuclear power, three of the newest nuclear plants will be allowed to remain open until 2022.",2011-05-30T13:56:32.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-europe

So it proposes to ship the fuel to France, where the plutonium in it can be extracted by reprocessing for use as nuclear fuel for other power plants. That may solve the immediate problem of what to do with Shoreham's radioactive residue. But it could open the way for a dangerous worldwide trade in plutonium that can be diverted into bomb-making. Those who made the decision defend it as the quickest way to dispose of the spent fuel. But it is surely not the safest, and perhaps not the cheapest. The Power Authority can do better. The disposal problem arose because Shoreham, although never commissioned, conducted demonstration runs operating at low power. That contaminated the plant and made the nuclear fuel considerably more radioactive. Several other nuclear power plants in the United States are scheduled to be decommissioned. They too would like to dispose of their spent nuclear fuel by reprocessing it into plutonium. But such reprocessing raises risks of spreading nuclear arms-making materials. Precisely because of these risks, the U.S. for a time prevented reprocessing at home. No reprocessing plant now exists in the U.S. But France has such a facility and Britain is completing one. What will become of the plutonium they produce is worrisome. The world already has more than enough nuclear fuel from uranium. And additional uranium now being recovered from dismantled nuclear arms can be converted into fuel. Such uranium fuel can't be used for bomb-making without undergoing the difficult process of enrichment. Plutonium fuel, in contrast, can be used in crude bombs. The Long Island Power Authority can find a better means of disposal. Long Islanders will pay $74 million to have France take the fuel off their hands. Perhaps the Philadelphia Electric Company or Mexico, which can use the partially burned fuel in a new power plant scheduled to open next year, might charge less. That would also be safer. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has yet to approve the Shoreham shipment to France for reprocessing. It might hold up any decision until the Clinton Administration has a chance to review the policy of nuclear waste disposal. In the meantime New York can come up with a safer method than producing proliferation-prone plutonium.",1992-12-13T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,opinion
b183c5f4-d741-57f9-becf-164e8d06aac6,https://www.tipsproject.eu/tips/,Using Nuclear Power to Extract Oil?,"? After several years of speculation, the Alberta government last month released a long-awaited “ expert’s report ” on nuclear power and oil sands and has now embarked on a series of province-wide public consultations . The move comes on the heels of a decision last month by Bruce Power , a private company that operates a publicly-owned nuclear station in western Ontario, to seek approval to build a $10 billion nuclear station at a site known as Whitemud, about 310 miles northwest of Edmonton. Bruce Power hopes to begin an environmental assessment next year. Its proposal calls for two to four 1,000-megawatt reactors, with three vendors – Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. , Westinghouse and Areva – competing to supply the equipment. According to the expert panel report, almost 90 percent of Alberta’s electricity comes from coal or natural gas, and demand is projected to jump 74 percent within the next 15 years, largely due to the needs of the oil sands projects — which consumes roughly 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas daily. At the same time, the National Energy Board has projected a drop in long-term natural gas production in Western Canada, and continued consumption by oil-sands production could turn the province into a net importer within the next few decades. The nuclear option received a boost last fall from the Canada West Foundation , an economic and public policy research group representing the four Western Canadian provinces, which released an analysis that concluded “the opportunities outweigh the challenges with regard to the expansion/development of nuclear power in Alberta and Saskatchewan.” But anti-nuclear activists and critics of Alberta’s oil sands industry are questioning the idea of using nuclear energy as an alternative. Andrew Nikiforuk, a Canadian journalist and the author of the 2008 book, “Tar Sands: Dirty Oil and the Future of a Continent,” said Royal Dutch Shell has been testing a bitumen extraction process in Colorado that relies less on natural gas and instead uses long electrodes that can be driven down into the shale to gradually separate the trapped oil. Canadian environmental groups like the Pembina Institute oppose the use of nuclear reactors to supply electricity for oil sands production, citing issues like cost, spent fuel storage and water contamination. Other anti-nuclear networks have also sprung up as Alberta moves forward with its assessment. Beyond the customary objections to nuclear power, Mr. Nikiforuk observes that the project may serve to further impair Canada’s international reputation on energy policy. “The first country to use nuclear power to produce fossil fuels will not be highly regarded on the planet.”",2009-04-27T15:35:15.000+02:00,NYTIMES,science

Another major obstacle for nuclear power is its price: Nuclear plants cost billions of dollars to build, making them one of the most expensive sources of electricity. Solar panels, by contrast, now generate the cheapest electricity in history — so cheap that new solar projects, building costs included, can now compete with existing nuclear plants. “What is remarkable about these trends,” a report on the nuclear industry found last year, “is that the costs of renewables continue to fall due to incremental manufacturing and installation improvements while nuclear, despite over half a century of industrial experience, continues to see costs rising.” That explains in part why France’s reliance on nuclear power remains such an outlier. “No country has managed to develop a safe, successful, economically competitive nuclear power industry in a market-based environment,” Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard historian, said last year. “This tells us that nuclear power is unlikely to be successful in market-based economies. It may work in China, but it is unlikely to work in most other places.” Nuclear power proponents say its economic problems can be solved. Putting a price on carbon pollution so that fossil fuels reflect their true environmental cost, for example, could help make nuclear power competitive with natural gas, as could advances in reactor designs. Last year, the Department of Energy announced that it would fund the development of two such designs, including one championed by Bill Gates. But carbon taxes have so far proved a political nonstarter in the United States, and an analysis from the Union of Concerned Scientists in March found that so-called advanced reactor designs “do not offer obvious improvements” over current technology, could pose novel safety risks and will likely take decades to achieve commercial viability. Advances in battery technology that could solve the long-duration storage problem of renewables, on the other hand, appear closer on the horizon. Perhaps most important, nuclear power plants take much longer to build than renewable energy projects. Since the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, the construction time for most reactors in the United States has exceeded 10 years, Allison Macfarlane notes in Foreign Affairs. If the United States hopes to meet its emissions reduction targets, it can’t afford to wait that long. “We need strong government support of noncarbon-emitting energy technologies that are ready to be deployed today, not 10 or 20 years from now,” she writes. “We have run out of time.”",2021-08-27T00:15:03.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

The United States is competing with France, Russia and, in a minor way, Canada to build four 1,000-megawatt plants that energy executives say will signify China's coming of age as a nuclear energy provider, and offer crucial relief to makers of nuclear technology starved of new orders in their home countries. ''China is the country most likely to have robust growth in nuclear power in the next 10 years,'' said Ron Sinard, who oversees plant development for the Nuclear Energy Institute, a Washington organization that represents the United States industry. ''Looking at the market over the next decade, it's probably the biggest piece of the pie.'' The call for tenders may be issued as early as this month, nuclear industry executives said. The winner is likely to have an advantage in subsequent bids for 20 or more nuclear plants that may be built by 2020. China currently has eight nuclear power plants that generate a total of 6,200 megawatts; by 2020 nuclear power could provide China with 32,000 megawatts. Even if all the proposed plants are built, nuclear power would supply China with about 4 percent of its electricity needs by 2020, with the bulk of electricity coming from coal-fired stations and, to a lesser extent, hydroelectric projects like the Three Gorges Dam. In choosing among rival bids, China will be making choices not only on which technology it will use but also on geopolitical allegiances, environmental safety and, in the case of American bidders, China's gaping trade surplus with the United States. ''The stakes are huge. These are big contracts with a lot of implications,'' said Jean-Christophe Delvallet, who represents the French energy company EDR in China. In recent months, a procession of political leaders has pressed China to favor power plant designs and equipment from their home countries. They have included President Jacques Chirac of France; former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien of Canada; Viktor Khristenko, who was named fuel and energy minister in Russia on Tuesday; and dozens of less-prominent officials. President Bush even raised the virtues of American nuclear technology with the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, during a meeting in December, said Jim Fici, a senior vice president at Westinghouse, which has long sought to enter China's nuclear energy sector. The expense of building nuclear plants -- more than $2 billion for each unit -- may weigh in Westinghouse's favor as China considers big purchases to close its $113 billion trade gap with the United States. When the deputy prime minister of China, Wu Yi, travels to the United States in April to discuss trade disagreements, the sale of American nuclear technology will be on the agenda, according to United States government officials. Westinghouse is based in the United States, but is owned by BNFL, a British company. China is likely to shift from its current mixture of Canadian, French and Russian technology to a more uniform array of plants, nearly all the officials and executives interviewed said. ''They want a more standardized system,'' said Rene de Preneuf, the chief China representative for Areva, the French-based nuclear energy company. Standardization would make building and running plants less expensive and safer, he said, because it allows equipment, skills and experience to be shared across a wider net. Standardization also means the successful bidder has the lucrative prospect of a run of similar projects. Most observers agreed the main contest is between Areva, a company that has long dealt with China and hopes to sell its latest generation of Framatome ER reactors, and Westinghouse, which hopes to sell its AP1000 reactor, a model so new that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not yet approved it for construction in the United States. This is not the first time China has publicized plans for expanding nuclear energy. Similar plans were announced in the early 1990's but were abandoned because of a slowing economy and a temporary glut in electricity. Energy industry executives and analysts agreed that this time the Chinese government, alarmed by the country's voracious appetite for electricity and growing dependence on imported oil and natural gas, is determined to expand its nuclear energy resources. Power shortages that disrupted industrial production across two dozen provinces last year revived interest in nuclear power. Last year electricity demand increased 15 percent to 1.9 trillion kilowatt hours, and tens of thousands of factories in China's eastern provinces were forced to cancel production because of power cuts. Similar power shortages are expected this year and next. The chairman of China's electricity regulation commission, Chai Songyue, said that China would face a shortfall of 20 million kilowatt hours this year. Stronger government support for nuclear energy is reinforced by enthusiastic promises of investment for China's power companies. ''A lot of utilities are investing money to prepare sites that might be approved in the next five-year plan,'' said Simon Tang, who represents Atomic Energy of Canada in Beijing, referring to China's five-year budget, which will be released next year. The booming coastal provinces of Zhejiang and Guangdong are the first in line for nuclear power stations, in part because coal mines and dams are far away, making energy transport a major expense. ''You must look at this at a local basis,'' said Philip Andrews-Speed, an expert on China's energy sector at the University of Dundee in Scotland. But energy companies see China as their best potential market. ''Western nuclear suppliers see China as one of their greatest hopes for rekindling their business,'' said Edwin Lyman, a specialist on nuclear energy issues with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a United States group that opposes nuclear energy. Economic concerns may outweigh worries about China's role in the spread of nuclear weapons. Westinghouse developed the AP1000, which can generate 1,100 megawatts, with half a billion dollars of support from the federal government, and the government would collect tens of millions of dollars in royalties from any such plant in China, a senior United States energy official said. Credit support from the Import-Export Bank may also be used to finance the plants, he said, and Chinese officials had sought assurances that China would receive an export license for the plant. The National Reform and Development Commission, China's top energy agency, and Chinese nuclear agencies all declined to be interviewed for this article. Critics are concerned that China's leap into nuclear power may test its immature and incomplete regulatory system. Mr. Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists said it was not clear how China would ensure that its radioactive materials remained safe, in civilian hands. He said the AP1000 design lacked too many traditional safety backups. His concerns were dismissed by proponents of the deal. Mr. Fici, of Westinghouse, said tests showed the AP1000 was many times safer than existing plants. The transfer of the AP1000 technology to China would ''raise no new policy issues'' in proliferation, the United States government official said. The official said he was confident China would abide by United States rules preventing the transfer of licensed nuclear technology to third countries. Critics and skeptics of China's nuclear energy program agreed that over the coming years, the shape and speed of its expansion will be at the mercy of economic downturns and political uncertainties. ''Now there's a scramble to build as much generation as possible,'' said Mr. Sinton, the analyst. ''But with all this building there's the possibility of overcapacity in a few years' time. There are systemic factors that lead to a boom and bust cycle.''",2004-03-10T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business

Vice President Dick Cheney certainly thinks so. ''We can safeguard the environment by making greater use of the cleanest method of power generation we know,'' he said in a speech last month outlining the Bush administration's coming energy policy proposals. ''If we are serious about environmental protection, then we must seriously question the wisdom of backing away from what is, as a matter of record, a safe, clean and very plentiful energy source.'' And longstanding advocates for atomic energy like Mr. Cheney are not the only ones who now argue that more nuclear plants may be needed to temper the burning of fossil fuels -- coal, oil and even natural gas -- that contribute to air pollution and global warming. Consider the views of William Nordhaus, a Yale economics professor who has studied the Swedish nuclear industry for Resources for the Future, a middle-of-the-road environmental research group. ''Nuclear power is a long way from coming back,'' he said. ''But if you are really serious about coming to grips with global warming, nuclear or some other yet-to-be-proven technology needs to play a role.'' But for nuclear power to have even a modest revival, it must do more than overcome public fears about safety -- both in operations and disposal of radioactive waste. Far more important, new nuclear plants must compete economically against other power sources. And that won't be easy. Despite the electricity deregulation fiasco in California, the power industry has largely abandoned its traditional approach -- in which utility monopolies, after approval by state regulators, built their own power plants under a guarantee that users would cover the full costs. Now, most new electricity sources -- from midsize gas-fired generators to clusters of windmills -- are built by outside producers, essentially on spec. Under these conditions, no one is prepared to take the risk of sinking billions of dollars into the kind of huge reactors, capable of powering a million homes or so, that were built in the 1960's and 70's. And rightly so. ''To order a new nuclear plant today,'' said Robert D. Glynn Jr., the chairman of Pacific Gas & Electric in San Francisco, ''you'd have to be crazy.'' Around the world, construction of nuclear plants has practically ground to a halt. No utility in the United States has ordered a nuclear plant in a quarter-century; dozens that were on the drawing boards have been canceled. Even in France, where nuclear power has long been favored by the government, no new reactors are on order. ''I almost have to laugh when Cheney says environmentalists are out of touch with reality,'' said Christopher Flavin, president of the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental advocacy group in Washington. ''He's the one basically trying to reverse history. Yet in the meantime, the power industry has moved from a centralized to a decentralized model. Those who think nuclear power can make a comeback are the ones who are being naïve and unrealistic.'' Supporters of nuclear energy pin their hopes on a new approach, known as the pebble-bed modular reactor, that is supposed to be safer, cheaper and faster to build and roughly one-tenth the size of the current generation of light water nuclear plants. ''We recognize that these new generation plants, if they are to succeed, will have to compete on the basis of cost -- without subsidies,'' said Elizabeth A. Moler, a top Energy Department official in the Clinton administration and now a senior vice president at the Exelon Corporation, a large energy company that operates 17 nuclear power plants. WHILE it will take years for changes in nuclear technology to get off the ground, perhaps it is time to start putting that thinking to the test. Environmentalists like Mr. Flavin say nuclear power will fail in a truly open market. It will have to compete, he said, not only with the many new midsize power plants that will run on natural gas but also with the proliferation of ''micropower'' devices -- solar cells, wind turbines, fuel cells and the like -- that can rely on renewable energy sources. The environmentalists may be right. But either way, some counterweights to the nation's -- and the world's -- excessive dependence on fossil fuels are clearly needed. Such balances would not only lessen risks from global warming, but would also limit the economic damage at the times when oil and gas become more expensive. ''There's too much inflexibility in the whole energy system,'' said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ''As it stands now, we're making a big bet on natural gas. It's a good bet, but we need some other bets, too.'' ECONOMIC VIEW",2001-05-13T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business

His bold new stance challenges his protégé, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose policies would restart as many nuclear power plants as possible (now all shut down), and even promote the export of nuclear reactors. Mr. Koizumi deems the pursuit of nuclear power “aimless” and “irresponsible.” Japan should welcome Mr. Koizumi’s intervention and begin a healthy debate on the future of nuclear power that has not occurred in the two and a half years since the Fukushima disaster. The Japanese Diet did conduct an independent investigation, which concluded Fukushima to be a man-made disaster. But the investigation did not lead to serious parliamentary debate. Mr. Koizumi, whose change of views is startling, shows that there is quite a split on the issue in the political class. As a pro-growth prime minister from 2001 to 2006, he was an enthusiastic proponent of cheap and clean nuclear power. Now he declares that it is the most expensive form of energy, citing not only the many billions of dollars needed to clean up Fukushima but also the unknown cost and method of dealing with nuclear waste. He also criticizes the current government’s assumption that nuclear power is essential for economic growth. Ever the acute reader of political moods, Mr. Koizumi argues that a zero nuclear policy could be cause for a great social movement in a country still gripped by economic gloom after 15 years of deflation. In the wake of Fukushima, one would think that the Japanese government could not restart nuclear power reactors without firm public support. Not so. According to opinion polls, the majority of Japanese oppose nuclear power, even among supporters of the Abe government. A poll last week found that 76 percent of those surveyed said they did not think the Fukushima plant was “under control.” The government reckons the earthquake and tsunami that struck Fukushima is a once-in-a-thousand-year occurrence. Yet it also estimates that there is a 60 percent to 70 percent probability of a major earthquake and tsunami hitting the most densely populated coastline within the next 30 years. That coastline, dotted with nuclear power plants, reaches from Tokyo to the southern island of Kyushu. Prime Minister Abe has been stressing the need to shed the deflation mentality for Japan to lift itself out of economic stagnation. Japan can certainly do with a change in attitude. Mr. Koizumi makes a compelling argument that if the ruling Liberal Democratic Party were to announce a zero nuclear policy, “the nation could come together in the creation of a recyclable society unseen in the world,” and the public mood would rise in an instant.",2013-10-15T02:59:30.000+02:00,NYTIMES,editorial-opinion
e765f25a-1715-5d60-8d84-3b292e437815,https://www.tipsproject.eu/tips/,Is Nuclear Power Renewable?,"? Many environmental groups are fundamentally opposed to the notion that nuclear power is a renewable form of energy — on the grounds that it produces harmful waste byproducts and relies on extractive industries to procure fuel like uranium. Even so, the nuclear industry and pro-nuclear officials from countries including France have been trying to brand the technology as renewable, on the grounds that it produces little or no greenhouse gases. Branding nuclear as renewable could also enable nuclear operators to benefit from some of the same subsidies and friendly policies offered to clean energies like wind, solar and biomass. So far, however, efforts to categorize nuclear as a renewable source of power are making little headway. The latest setback came last week, when the head of the International Renewable Energy Agency –- an intergovernmental group known as IRENA that advises about 140 member countries on making the transition to clean energy –- dismissed the notion of including nuclear power among its favored technologies. “IRENA will not support nuclear energy programs because it’s a long, complicated process, it produces waste and is relatively risky,” Hélène Pelosse, its interim director general, told Reuters last week . Energy sources like solar power, Ms. Pelosse said, are better alternatives — and less expensive ones, “especially with countries blessed with so much sun for solar plants,” she said.",2009-08-03T15:27:09.000+02:00,NYTIMES,science

Emergency evacuation zones are now set at a 10-mile radius from operating nuclear-power plants, a regulation established after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. A growing number of citizens and state and local officials have disputed the adequacy of 10-mile emergency planning zones - most notably at Shoreham on Long Island, Seabrook in New Hampshire and Perry in Ohio. Instead of responding to increased public concern about nuclear-power safety, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is attempting to decrease safety by proposing to reduce emergency planning zones to a mere two miles. You quote the commission's Denwood Ross, saying to justify this decrease, ''Maybe some would just need to close their windows or go in the basement.'' The public has until next March 9 to protest the N.R.C.'s petition to reduce the required emergency planning zone. The Chernobyl catastrophe underscores the inadequacy of current United States emergency-planning standards. In the days immediately following the Soviet reactor accident, approximately 135,000 people within a radius of 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) of the reactor had to be evacuated. Moreover, children were removed for several months from towns as far as 100 miles from the accident. Even so, estimates of the eventual number of human fatalities from that catastrophe range from 10,000 to 150,000. Just 25 miles north of New York City, much closer than Kiev is to Chernobyl, the two Indian Point nuclear reactors pose a threat to more than 17 million people living within 50 miles. The American nuclear industry is no less prone to human error and faulty technology than the Russians: the N.R.C. itself has forecast a 45 percent chance of a severe core meltdown in the United States before the year 2000. An accident as severe as Chernobyl can happen at Indian Point. While United States public-opinion polls show increasing opposition to nuclear power, the N.R.C. and the nuclear industry are scrambling to dismantle regulatory requirements meant to protect the public. Instead of reducing the evacuation zones around nuclear-power plants, the N.R.C. should be expanding them. Furthermore, the N.R.C. should require radiological emergency planning for major population centers near nuclear-power plants. If cities such as New York and Boston cannot devise workable evacuation plans, then nuclear-power plants should not be operating close by.

The spokesman, Gennadi Gerasimov, said in a news conference that the turbine generators of the No. 4 reactor, the one involved in the accident of April 26, were being tested to see whether they could continue to provide power for 40 to 45 seconds in the event of an emergency shutdown until the power supply could be switched over to a back-up source. A statement by the Politburo last weekend said the accident had been caused by improperly conducted experiments involving operation of the turbine generators, but it did not describe the experiments. In a nuclear power generating station, the controlled chain reaction in a reactor produces the heat that converts water into the steam needed to drive the turbine generators that make electricity. In a station of the Chernobyl type, each 1,000-megawatt nuclear reactor supplies steam to two 500-megawatt turbine generators. Technical Details Still Unclear Mr. Gerasimov's explanation today still left unclear exactly why the experiment was conducted and how it led to the power surge that ultimately produced a hydrogen explosion, a fire and the release of radioactivity. ''The important thing is not that the experiment was conducted,'' Mr. Gerasimov said. ''The important thing is that it was conducted without the necessary precautions.'' He said technical details would be available when a report of the Soviet Government inquiry commission was delivered to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna next month. Mr. Gerasimov denied that engineers at the Chernobyl station were trying to simulate an accident when the real accident occurred. He also denied that the experiment had any military purpose. Some Western experts say graphite reactors of the type used at the Chernobyl station and some other Soviet commercial power plants can produce plutonium, a component of nuclear weapons. Nuclear Weapons Official Out Among the officials dismissed in the wake of the Chernobyl accident was Aleksandr G. Meshkov, First Deputy Minister of Medium Machine-Building, a cover name for the production of fissionable material and nuclear arms. The connection between this agency and the generation of commercial nuclear power has not been officially explained. Nuclear power stations have been operated by the Ministry of Electric Power, which also runs the nation's fossil-fuel burning power plants and hydroelectric stations. As a result of the Chernobyl accident, the nuclear electricity industry has now been placed under a newly formed separate Ministry of Nuclear Power. The Soviet Government has acknowledged a death toll of 28 as a result of the Chernobyl accident, and has put the economic losses at $2.7 billion.",1986-07-25T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world

Years after largely abandoning efforts to apply atomic power to space, NASA last week announced a Nuclear Systems Initiative that it said could jump-start space exploration within a decade. Tucked away in the Bush administration's proposed 2003 budget for the agency is $125.5 million to begin moving NASA into a new nuclear age. In the early days of the space program, NASA looked into nuclear-powered rockets as a possible means of sending humans to Mars and other planets. The agency tested some atomic rocket engines, but abandoned the effort because no missions arose to use them. In the new program, nuclear reactors would not directly produce thrust to propel rockets as in the earlier program, but would be activated when far from Earth, to supply power for other types of engines. The agency also developed electric generators powered by radioactive materials that have been flown on two dozen spacecraft, including the Pioneer and Voyager outer planet probes and piloted Apollo missions to the moon. In 1997, the launching of another probe with a nuclear generator, the Cassini mission to Saturn, drew protests from some environmental and antinuclear groups that worried that a rocket explosion might spread radioactivity. Now only one of these power units, called radioisotope thermoelectric generators, or R.T.G.'s, remain in the civilian space inventory, and officials say it is time to reopen production lines. The new program, they say, presents an opportunity to design and build new generators that are more efficient, require less nuclear fuel and can be used on more varied spacecraft. NASA is proposing to spend $950 million over the next five years to develop new types of atomic-powered generators to supply electricity for spacecraft, and also to build nuclear electric rockets to propel ships through space at greater speed than possible with traditional rockets. The NASA administrator, Sean O'Keefe, said nuclear power would help space explorers ''conquer the problems of distance and time.'' It takes a long time for spacecraft to travel within the solar system, he said, noting that it would take more than a decade for a probe to reach Pluto using current technology. The continued exploration of the solar system and the space beyond is being held back by the limits of conventional chemical rockets as well as existing spacecraft power supplies, which mostly use solar-powered cells, Mr. O'Keefe said. Officials said the nuclear program would be conducted with the Department of Energy, which has the facilities and expertise to construct nuclear power units. Earl Wahlquist, of the Energy Department's Space and Defense Power Systems Division, said the fuel most widely used in R.T.G.'s, plutonium-238, is no longer produced in the United States. Mr. Wahlquist said that his agency would use NASA funds to buy the necessary plutonium from Russia. Dr. Edward Weiler, head of space science at NASA, said nuclear generators were necessary for outer planet missions, where sunlight is faint. Jupiter, he noted, receives only 4 percent of the sunlight that reaches Earth. The Galileo spacecraft, which has been exploring Jupiter and its moons, is powered by two R.T.G.'s. But new nuclear generators also could revolutionize studies of near planets, he said. The Smart Lander mission for Mars, which was scheduled for launching in 2007, will be delayed for two years to convert it from a solar-powered rover to one run by a nuclear unit. For roughly the same cost, he said, the 180-day solar-powered mission could be stretched to 1,000 days with nuclear power and the machine could range up to 50 miles instead of a mile or two as it looks for signs of life. For propulsion, a nuclear reactor could be used as a heat source to power new kinds of engines, like the electric ion drive successfully used on the recent Deep Space 1 mission. That spacecraft used solar power to run an engine that continually pushed it with very low thrust to high speeds. This approach used fuel 10 times as efficiently as conventional chemical rockets, which burn for a few minutes and require the spacecraft to coast for the rest of its trip. A nuclear-powered ion drive could sent a craft to Pluto in half the time as existing rockets, Dr. Weiler said. A major priority of the new program will be safety, he said, and developing technology that will virtually eliminate any risk to the public if something goes wrong, like a launching accident. ''We will design these new systems for a worst-case scenario,'' Dr. Weiler said, ''They'll be designed to survive a rocket blowing up, or one going up and then coming down and hitting the ground. If you can't guarantee this in your design, then we don't want to talk to you.'' NASA officials said the systems they envisioned would be launched by conventional rockets and not activated until safely in space. Once operating, they said, neither electric power supplies nor reactors powering engines would leave residual radiation. Still, there is some opposition to the initiative. The Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space, a group based in Florida, said it remained opposed to any nuclear systems in space and speculated that any new technology developed might be applied to military uses. Dr. Weiler said nuclear energy was not only safe but necessary for further space exploration. The limits of current power and propulsion systems are now starting to limit space science, he said. ''We are trying to continue the exploration of the solar system in covered wagons,'' he said, ''Now it's time to switch to the steam engine and build railroads to explore the solar system like railroads contributed to the exploration and expansion of this country.''

The Japanese disaster has led some energy officials in the United States and in industrialized European nations to think twice about nuclear expansion. And if a huge release of radiation worsens the crisis, even big developing nations might reconsider their ambitious plans. But for now, while acknowledging the need for safety, they say their unmet energy needs give them little choice but to continue investing in nuclear power. “Ours is a very power-hungry country,“ Srikumar Banerjee, the chairman of India’s Atomic Energy Commission, said during a news conference Monday in Mumbai. Nearly 40 percent of India’s 1.2 billion people do not have regular access to electricity, Mr. Banerjee said. “It is essential for us to have further electricity generation.“ And in China, which has the world’s most ambitious nuclear expansion plans, a vice minister of environment, Zhang Lijun, said on Saturday that Japan’s difficulties would not deter his nation’s nuclear rollout. With those two countries driving the expansion — and countries from elsewhere in Asia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East also embracing nuclear power in response to high fossil fuel prices and concerns about global warming — the world’s stock of 443 nuclear reactors could more than double in the next 15 years, according to the World Nuclear Association, an industry trade group. Not that Indian and Chinese officials are heedless of the risks of nuclear energy. India’s prime minister, Manmohan Singh, said Monday that his country’s Department of Atomic Energy would review all safety systems at India’s nuclear plants, “particularly with a view to ensuring that they would be able to withstand the impact of large natural disasters such as tsunamis and earthquakes.” During a political conference in Beijing on Sunday, Xie Zhenhua, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, said, “Evaluation of nuclear safety and the monitoring of plants will be definitely strengthened.” China’s nuclear power industry has 11 reactors operating and plans to start construction on as many 10 new ones a year during the next decade. China’s electricity consumption continues to climb 12 percent a year, even as usage stagnates in the West. India, with 20 nuclear reactors already in operation, plans to spend an estimated $150 billion adding dozens of new ones around the country. Its forecast calls for nuclear power to supply about a quarter of the country’s electricity needs by 2050, a tenfold increase from now. One company that could benefit from the continued global push for nuclear energy is General Electric, a maker of reactors. Other big players include Areva of France and Toshiba’s Westinghouse unit. But on Monday, at least, G.E.’s chairman and chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, found himself on the nuclear defensive. G.E. was the designer of the reactors at the 40-year-old Fukushima Daiichi plant in Okuma, Japan, that was damaged by last Friday’s tsunami and has had a series of explosions since then. Mr. Immelt, who happened to be in New Delhi on a previously planned promotional tour for his company’s products and services, said at a news conference Monday that it was too early to predict what effect, if any, the events in Japan could have on the nuclear energy industry. G.E.’s stock closed down more than 2 percent on Monday, to $19.92. “We just have to let discovery take place, and let countries reach their own conclusions,” he said. “There has been an almost 50-year track record from nuclear power that people can look back on and make their own judgments on.” Asked whether the Fukushima Daiichi plant’s oceanfront location had contributed to its vulnerability, Mr. Immelt replied, “On location and all that other stuff — let’s just let it take its course.” So far, G.E. has not been a major supplier of nuclear equipment to India. Most of the country’s existing reactors have been built locally. Later this year, the country will commission a Russian-backed plant. India also signed a nuclear reactor deal with Areva in December for $9.3 billion. The United States has lobbied extensively to open India’s nuclear power market to American industry. Indian and American officials spent more than five years negotiating a nuclear energy agreement that was blessed by both governments and international nuclear agencies. That deal, completed last August, is considered one of Mr. Singh’s major foreign policy successes and a cornerstone of his Congress Party’s pledge to help India’s economic growth. But the pact included an unusual liability clause that makes nuclear power plant suppliers, not just operators, liable if accidents occur. Despite American pressure to change that provision, the Japan disaster could encourage Indian legislators to keep it in place. G.E. and Westinghouse have said they will stay out of the Indian nuclear market unless the country changes its liability law to conform with international standards. Walt Patterson, an associate fellow at Chatham House in London, predicted that the problems at Japan’s nuclear plants would refocus attention on safety and away from the economic viability of atomic energy. “The question mark about safety was really way down the agenda,” Mr. Patterson said. “This will bring it right back to the top of the agenda.” Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Monday said her country’s plan to prolong the life of the country’s nuclear power stations would be tabled while the German government reassessed the situation. Switzerland on Monday suspended plans to build new plants and replace existing ones. The Swiss energy minister, Doris Leuthard, said in a statement that the “safety and well-being of the population have the highest priority.” But at the same time, Italy, Russia and the Czech Republic all said they would stick to their energy policies. Across the Middle East, countries have been racing to build up nuclear power, as a growth and population boom has created unprecedented demand for energy, and as Iran forges ahead with the Bushehr nuclear facility. The United Arab Emirates has taken the lead with a plan to build four plants in the city of Braka, on the Persian Gulf, by 2017 to generate about a quarter of the country’s power by 2020. The Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation, the project’s developer, is “closely monitoring the situation in Japan,” a spokesman said Monday, although no reassessment of the effort is under way. The emirates plan to use pressurized water reactors bought from Korea Electric Power Company of South Korea in a $20 billion deal, passing over French and American bids for the project. One of the emirates, Abu Dhabi, chose Braka because it is near the water and an existing power grid, far from populated areas, and lies on a seismically stable landmass. Because the Persian Gulf is an enclosed sea, planners say there is little threat of a tsunami in the event of an earthquake. By contrast, Iran’s Bushehr nuclear plant, also on the Persian Gulf, is much less seismically stable, which worries environmentalists. Any nuclear leak there would quickly reach the wealthy emirates of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and others because the gulf’s currents run clockwise. The Iranian plant unloaded nuclear fuel in February after a computer worm infected the reactor. Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Egypt are all also studying nuclear energy, and even oil-rich Saudi Arabia is considering a nuclear-powered city. Most plants would be placed in seismically stable areas, although one planned by Jordan at the Red Sea port of Aqaba is on a major faultline. Turkey on Monday said it would move ahead with plans for two nuclear plants, including one that may use Japanese nuclear technology from the Tokyo Electric Power Company and Toshiba. Numerous geological faultlines cross the country. India’s nuclear energy establishment has faced stiff opposition to its ambitious plans from environmentalists and villagers at plant sites. Many of the questions posed to energy officials at Monday’s news conference addressed a controversial nuclear project on the western coast of the country, north of Goa, a tourist destination. As currently envisioned, it would be the world’s largest nuclear energy complex. But analysts in India said the Japan crisis was unlikely to stir up significantly more public protest against nuclear plants here, given the pressing demand for more electricity. “If 1 percent of the population was against nuclear power, you might now get 2 percent,“ said G. Balachandran, a consulting fellow at the Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis, a policy research organization in New Delhi. “I am really not concerned about the opposition that may develop around this.”",2011-03-15T03:44:08.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

That is the latest of several recent developments that could lessen the troubles of utilities with nuclear plants. Gregory B. Enholm, a utilities analyst with Salomon Brothers, said that Consumers' Midland proposal, along with two other recent regulatory decisions on troubled nuclear plants, had provided new options for utilities. He said that these developments ''indicate there may be ways for a utility to recover its investment in a troubled nuclear plant other than completing it as a nuclear plant.'' Consumers' attempt to recover at least some of its investment in the $4.2 billion plant was not a surprise. The proposed conversion became all but a certainty late last year when William T. McCormick Jr., Consumers' new chairman, ordered a study of the options for completing the plant. The company says the conversion would cost $434 million and result in a rate increase request of 25 percent over five years. The Michigan Public Service Commission has thus far been noncommittal about the idea. One of the two other regulatory decisions involved Public Service of Indiana, which, along with Northern Indiana Public Service, suffered great financial difficulty when forced to abandon their Marble Hill nuclear facility. Under an agreement with the state utility commission, P.S.I. was granted an annual rate increase of $68.2 million for a four-year period; 3 to 5 percent of the total $273 million increase will be for its investment in Marble Hill. The second regulatory decision involves a situation similar to what Consumers Power has proposed: The Ohio Public Utilities Commission has approved an agreement under which the three utility co-owners of the Zimmer nuclear plant can convert the facility to a coal-fired power plant. In exchange, the companies - Cincinnati Gas and Electric, Dayton Power and Light, and Columbus and Southern Ohio - agreed to absorb half of the Zimmer plant's $1.7 billion cost and, if the plant is converted to coal, not to seek to recover in rates more than $3.6 billion of the converted plant's total cost. Mr. Enholm thinks that the Consumers Power proposal stands a good chance of being approved by the Michigan regulators because of the Zimmer case precedent and because it appears that the utility will need to increase its capacity to meet a growing demand for electricity in Michigan. Consumers Power stock was unchanged yesterday at $13.25 in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading in a strong market, but Mark D. Luftig, another Salomon analyst, said that was due to the company's saying that earnings for the year would be slightly better than 25 cents a share if it did not take any write-offs for the Midland plant and there was no action on rate relief. By contrast, other utilities generally benefited from yesterday's strong stock market rally, which pushed the Dow Jones utilities index up 2.36 points, to 187.63. Cincinnati Gas and Electric yesterday closed at $24.75 on the Big Board, up 50 cents; Dayton Power and Light finished at $23.375, up 37.5 cents, and American Electric Power, the owner of Columbus and Southern Ohio, rose 75 cents, to $27. More generally, Consolidated Edison was up 75 cents, to $42.25; Northeast Utilities, 37.5 cents, to $21.875, and San Diego Gas and Electric, 62.5 cents, to $32.50. Mr. Enholm believes the ''conversion option'' is likely to be studied by more utilities that have nuclear facilities whose operation is open to question, although it is not in a utility's interest to say so publicly until facing a regulatory brick wall. However, just how many nuclear plants are candidates for these options is, like so much else about the nuclear power industry, subject to debate. On the one hand, industry spokesman point to the fact that more nuclear plants have come on line -six began operating in 1984; seven in 1985 - than at any time since the late 1970's as proof that acceptance of nuclear power is growing. There are now 98 operable nuclear plants in the United States, five of which have yet to gain commercial status. Twenty-five plants are being built, according to data from the Atomic Industrial Forum, an industry group. Nuclear power now generates 15.5 percent of the nation's electricity, compared with 50 percent for coal and 10 percent for oil. However, industry critics cite such facilities as the Shoreham plant on Long Island, and the Seabrook reactor in New Hampshire, as examples of the industry's still-serious safety and financial problems, and they question whether most of the plants scheduled to be built or become operable will ever actually be used as nuclear plants. Last year six nuclear plants, including all five licensed reactors built by the Tennessee Valley Authority, were closed because of safety problems. Whatever the case, Mr. Luftig, the Salomon analyst, said it was unlikely the controversies over electricity rate increases that nuclear plants had generated would abate. That includes plants that are conversion candidates.",1986-04-09T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,financial-desk-business-day

From Lithuania to Armenia, in the press and in the streets, the Soviet nuclear power industry is suffering from a phenomenon that used to be unimportant here: a mistrustful public. In part because of shaken public confidence, at least five planned nuclear power stations have been quietly canceled since a reactor at the Chernobyl atomic power station exploded in April 1986. Work has been suspended at several other sites, and some experts say they expect the list of abandoned projects to grow. Some of the strongest opposition to nuclear plants has come from restive ethnic minorities in some non-Russian republics, where atomic energy and nuclear waste disposal have become symbols of Moscow's indifference to local feeling - and where public opinion is now apparently playing a policy role unusual in the Soviet Union. A senior official at the Ministry of Atomic Energy predicted this week that because of these setbacks and other problems, the total Soviet nuclear capacity in 1990 would, at best, reach 45 million kilowatts - less than two-thirds the amount forecast by economic planners before Chernobyl. But the ministry, at first caught off guard after a long immunity from public opinion, has begun a counteroffensive, forestalling cancellation of several contested projects and starting its first serious public relations venture. In the fight over nuclear power, promises by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, of greater openness and more democratic decision-making are often directly at odds with his desperate need to rejuvenate the economy. Next year local government officials are to be given greater authority in such matters, including assistance of ecological commissions that will look more aggressively at new projects and debate them in public. Nuclear power projects have always required the approval of the local authorities, but the procedure was a formality entailing no public discussion. ''Before Chernobyl, they were all more loyal,'' Yevgeny I. Ignatenko, chief of science and technology at the Ministry of Atomic Energy, said in an interview. ''Now they are more likely to be against us.'' Mr. Ignatenko, who gained prominence as the chief trouble-shooter sent in to oversee the cleanup of Chernobyl, said the nuclear industry was bracing for the new era of accountability. Among other things, he said, the traditionally secretive ministry plans to open a public relations center with a telephone hot line for the public and will assign experts to defend nuclear power in the press and on television. He said local officials who reject a nuclear plant should be required to come up with an alternative power source. ''We consume half as much electricity per capita as the United States, and the United States consumes much less than Sweden, say,'' Mr. Ignatenko said. ''If we want to produce a certain amount of consumer goods and raise the standard of living, we have to produce more electric power quickly. Now we have no other way.'' The Chernobyl accident, which killed 31 people and sent a radiation plume across Europe, was recognized instantly as a costly economic disruption. Chernobyl Cost $12.8 Billion The accident is estimated to have cost the Government $12.8 billion, including the price of encasing the ruptured reactor in concrete, relocating thousands of residents, buying replacement energy and fitting other nuclear power plants with new safety devices. The financial repercussions continue. Just the other day, an analyst in the Government newspaper Izvestia wrote that the cost of Chernobyl was partly to blame for a drop in agricultural investment that contributed to this year's poor grain harvest. But until this year, there was little evidence that the worldwide suspicion of nuclear power stirred by Chernobyl had slowed the expansion plans of the Soviet nuclear industry. A Western scientist joked on the first anniversary of the explosion that the accident had set back every nuclear power program except the Soviet one. The first official acknowledgment that public opinion posed a serious threat to the Soviet nuclear energy program came in January, when the youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported that fearful citizens had forced abandonment of an earthquake-prone site near Krasnodar, on the Black Sea. ''The Krasnodar nuclear power plant is perhaps the first to witness this, but it is not the only one,'' the newspaper reported, adding that all nuclear power plants now were ''bitterly opposed'' at the local level. Minsk Plant Canceled Last month Izvestia reported that public opposition had led to cancellation of a 2,000-megawatt nuclear plant designed to provide heat and electricity to Minsk, the capital of Byelorussia. A Soviet official had disclosed this decision in Frankfurt nearly a year earlier, but it had not been reported in the central Soviet press. In addition to the Minsk plant, Mr. Ignatenko said this week, plans have been abandoned for similar plants near Odessa and Kharkov in the Ukraine, and near Volgograd in southern Russia. These cancellations are well known locally, but have not been discussed in the central press. Mr. Ignatenko said the ministry was searching for new sites around Kharkov and Minsk where it could build plants to generate only electricity. Reactor Type Opposed The nuclear ministry also found itself under pressure to abandon new reactors of the same graphite-cooled type as the Chernobyl reactor. While the ministry has announced that it will begin no new plants of this type, it plans to complete five such reactors that are already under construction at existing plants. The most intense controversy has surrounded a third Chernobyl-style reactor under construction at Ignalina, in the Soviet republic of Lithuania. On Sept. 17, 6,000 demonstrators encircled the plant. They demanded that the two existing reactors be inspected by international experts because of a fire and reported radiation leaks. They said work on a third, 1,500-megawatt unit - already suspended by the Lithuanian legislature - should not be resumed. Critics say the reactor would raise the temperature of an adjoining lake. The plant director, Anatoly I. Khromenko, said in an interview that the two operating reactors had been stopped for repairs and inspection, but were scheduled to restart this month. The third reactor's future is in doubt, he said, and plans for a fourth were scrapped after the Chernobyl accident. ''Everything we do now in nuclear power is affected by Chernobyl,'' Mr. Khromenko said. Protests in Other Republics In other non-Russian republic as well, nuclear power has become a test of wills between local nationalists and Moscow. In Armenia, protesters have called for closing an 880-megawatt station at Metsamor, 25 miles from Yerevan. In Latvia, environmental groups have criticized a nuclear waste dump in Baldone, about 20 miles from Riga. ''Latvia should not be made to bear the burdens of the nuclear waste industry of the rest of the Soviet Union,'' said Juris Kajaks, a member of a Latvian environmental group. In some cases, the bureaucratic infighting over the fate of nuclear plants is so intense that the Soviet press itself seems confused about who has won. Dnieper Plant Halted On Sept. 8, for example, a radio station in the Ukraine announced that construction of a nuclear plant in Chigirin, on the banks of the Dnieper River, had been halted for ecological reasons, after months of fierce opposition. But Mr. Ignatenko said construction of the plant was being re-examined. An official at the plant site, reached by telephone, declined to say whether construction had halted. Soviet energy officials have scrambled to expand production of hydropower and gas-fueled energy stations, but it has not been enough to make up the difference. The newspaper Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya reported last week that new energy production brought on line this year - including nuclear and nonnuclear sources -would be less than half the amount called for in the yearly plan. One of the most striking changes since Chernobyl has been the attitude of the press, which previously treated nuclear power with reverence. Central papers have published investigative reports - including one by the party newspaper Pravda that found drunkenness, nepotism and mismanagement at Chernobyl two years after the accident - along with accounts of public opposition and essays by critics. Asked if he expected more ''pro and con'' in the press about nuclear development, Mr. Ignatenko responded with an annoyance shared by many nuclear power executives in the West, saying: ''We have plenty of that right now. And more con than pro.''",1988-10-13T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,front-page

Aging, expensive, unpopular, and still vulnerable to catastrophic accidents, it is the antithesis of the kinds of cutting-edge solutions that beguile the wealthy and well intentioned, who gather each winter in this Alpine ski resort. And yet nuclear energy is suddenly back on the agenda -- and not just here. Spurred on by politicians interested in energy independence and scientists who specialize in the field of climate change, Germany is reconsidering a commitment to shut down its nuclear power plants. France, Europe's leading nuclear power producer, is increasing its investment, as is Finland. At a time when industrialized countries are wrestling with how to curb carbon dioxide emissions, nuclear energy has one indisputable advantage: unlike coal, oil, natural gas, or even biological fuels, it emits no carbon dioxide. That virtue, in the view of advocates, is enough to offset its well-documented shortcomings. ''It has put nuclear back into the mix,'' said Daniel C. Esty, director of the Center for Environmental Law and Policy at Yale University. ''We're seeing a new balancing of the costs and benefits.'' But being in the mix does not mean nuclear energy will shove aside fossil fuels any time soon. In a way, the revival of interest in nuclear power illustrates the lack of palatable choices to combat global warming. Renewable energy, while growing steadily, has limitations. Windmills don't turn when the wind isn't blowing; solar power and geothermal energy are not yet economical enough; hydroelectric dams can be disruptive themselves. That leaves nuclear power as a ''clean'' alternative to fossil fuels. It already generates one-sixth of the world's electricity, but it fell out of favor in the West two decades ago after the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island accidents. The previous German government, in fact, pledged to shut down its last nuclear power station by 2022. But now Germany has also committed to deep reductions in carbon dioxide emissions in the next decade, and its new chancellor, Angela Merkel, rekindled the debate over nuclear energy by saying, ''We should consider what consequences it will have if we shut off our nuclear power plants.'' That comment was a reference to Europe's increasing vulnerability as an importer of foreign fossil fuels. Just as the United States worries about disruptions in the supply of Middle East oil, Europe worries about Russia's penchant for using its gas and oil pipelines as a political weapon. In a recent report, Deutsche Bank declared that Germany's energy policy was untenable. ''Far from reducing carbon emissions and securing future energy supplies,'' it concluded, ''current policies would increase both emissions and Germany's dependence on foreign gas imports.'' Even in the United States, which has not ordered cuts in carbon dioxide emissions, there are more voices in favor of building nuclear plants. ''The question is, how do we produce enough electricity?'' said James E. Rogers, the chief executive of Duke Energy Corporation, a major energy supplier. ''We need to put our money on nuclear.'' Critics point out that nuclear reactors are astronomically expensive, and take a decade or more to build, even if environmental groups fail to block construction altogether. Given the entrenched opposition in parts of Western Europe and America, some experts say that if the world does turn to nuclear power, most of the new plants will be in China, India and other developing countries. They also point out that the issue of security cuts both ways. Building more plants may reduce a country's reliance on imported oil and gas, but it also creates more targets for terrorist attacks. And there is the nuclear fuel cycle: North Korea and other countries are already suspected of diverting enriched uranium to try to make nuclear weapons. Those dangers would only multiply with an increase in the global demand for nuclear power. John P. Holdren, the director of the Woods Hole Research Center, said that if current economic predictions held, nuclear energy would have to generate one-third of the world's electricity by 2100 to curb the rise in carbon dioxide emissions. That would require a tenfold increase in the number of plants, to more than 3,000. To manage such a risk, Mr. Holdren said, the world would need a radically new regime for policing nuclear technology. One option would be international supervision of all nuclear plants. But is that realistic? Could all countries be treated equally? Right now, the United Nations is demanding that Iran suspend its enrichment of uranium, to forestall the possibility that it might be used for a weapons program. It would be, at the least, awkward for European countries to plunge back into nuclear energy at the same time that European diplomats are demanding that the Iranians scale back their nuclear ambitions. With so many downsides, even advocates acknowledge that nuclear power should play only a partial role in the energy mix -- and then only for an interim period, until it is replaced by newer technologies. Of course, there is another alternative: energy efficiency. But under the snow-capped peaks of Davos, the idea of simply turning down the thermostat has not yet caught on.

ALTHOUGH much of Europe remains committed to nuclear energy, the European nuclear power industry, which many American experts envy because of its safety record, has been suffering blow after blow. A West German company stands accused of mislabeling more than 2,000 waste drums as low-level nuclear waste when they often contained highly dangerous traces of plutonium. Investigators say that executives at Nukem, a major German nuclear fuel manufacturer, paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to government inspectors as well as officials of a Belgian nuclear waste reprocessing company to overlook the deception. Last month, the manager of a Nukem subsidiary committed suicide in jail after his arrest on bribery charges. Most disturbing are allegations by Germany's Environment Minister, Klaus Topfer, that some plutonium is missing. He raised the possibility - so far unproved - that it might have been sold illegally to Pakistan or Libya for use in an atomic bomb. ''The Nukem scandal is a severe blow to the European nuclear power industry and will no doubt provide ammunition for the Greens,'' said an industry official in Brussels, referring to West Germany's radical environmentalist party. Last spring, France's sophisticated Superphenix breeder reactor near the Swiss border was closed because of dangerous leaks of volatile sodium gas. A month ago the British Government revealed that a near-catastrophic nuclear accident had occurred in 1957 in northwest England and was hushed up for 30 years. The growing controversy over nuclear energy comes in the wake of the Chernobyl accident, which spewed radioactivity across Europe in April of 1986, turning millions of people against the industry. The Netherlands, which was about to approve two new nuclear power plants, decided to shelve them. Italy is talking about converting its nearly completed Montalto nuclear plant, 60 miles north of Rome, into a gas-fired facility. In addition, it has put a five-year moratorium on construction of nuclear plants. Sweden, which has pledged to phase out nuclear power by the year 2010, now says it wants to accelerate that plan by closing two plants in the mid-1990's. Europe gets about 35 percent of its electricity from nuclear energy - about twice the percentage as in the United States, where no new plants have been ordered since 1978. Last week, the Public Service Company of New Hampshire, whose embattled Seabrook nuclear plant has stood as a symbol of the environmental opposition to the American nuclear industry, filed for bankruptcy. A Continuing Commitment Despite their own extensive environmental movement, many European countries, lacking the fossil fuel resources of the United States, have refused to turn their backs on nuclear power. France, which now obtains 70 percent of its electricity from nuclear power, and Belgium, which obtains 60 percent, hardly seem to have been affected by Chernobyl. (Though France is now building plants at the rate of only one every two years, compared with one a year in the 1970's, the reduction is explained by slower economic growth.) Although Chernobyl steeled the resolve of British environmentalists, Britain, after much debate, just gave approval to build the first in a series of six new plants. ''What drives countries to nuclear power is economics and the desire not to be energy dependent,'' said Morris Rosen, a senior official with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. In its quest for independence, France has become the leader in nuclear reprocessing - taking spent fuel rods from nuclear plants and recycling the uranium and plutonium. France's huge La Hague facility in Normandy is the world's leading reprocessing plant. In a sense, the plant has been too successful, producing more of the troublesome plutonium than can be accommodated. The reprocessing facility was built to provide plutonium fuel for breeder reactors -an advanced type of power plant that, in theory, never needs refueling because it makes more plutonium than it consumes. But the construction of breeder reactors is far behind schedule - they are very expensive to build and the supply of the uranium that fuels conventional reactors has been less expensive and more reliable than had been anticipated. Complicating matters is that Superphenix, France's $4 billion breeder reactor, the world's largest, has not been operating since May. ''Reprocessing has turned out to be a disaster for the industry,'' said Colin Hines, an anti-nuclear campaigner for the environmental organization Greenpeace. The danger of plutonium becoming too easily available has convinced American officials to eschew reprocessing plants and breeder reactors. But like the Americans, the Europeans are also having problems finding places to store the growing mountain of nuclear waste. Although some nations are making room for low-level waste, the big problem is finding a site to store the highly radioactive material. ''There is a political problem in picking sites,'' said Fabrizio Caccia Dominioni, the European Community's director of nuclear energy projects. ''A lot of waste drums are piling up around Europe.''

The vote in Maki was 12,478 against the plant and 7,904 in favor, or 61 to 39 percent. Voter turnout was a high 88 percent. Although the referendum is nonbinding, the eyes of the nation have been on Maki, a town of 30,000 people on the coast of the Sea of Japan, about 150 miles north of Tokyo. One reason is that the ballot was the first of what could be a wave of local plebiscites, giving the people a new voice in affairs. Okinawa will hold a nonbinding vote next month on whether to reduce the American military bases there. The Maki results are also expected to hurt the plans of the Government and the electric utility industry to build more plants to reduce reliance on imported oil and gas. Japan has 49 nuclear plants that produce about 30 percent of the country's electricity, and the Government's hopes to increase such power use would require 20 more plants by 2010. But public resistance to nuclear power has risen in recent years, and anxiety increased after the leak of a coolant from a experimental fast-breeder reactor in December. ''The recent opinion polls show that the majority of Japanese people are very concerned about the safety of nuclear power plants,'' said Jinzaburo Takagi, head of the Citizens' Nuclear Information Center in Tokyo, a leading anti-nuclear group. Two cities in central Mie prefecture have won approval for referendums on a proposed nuclear plant. Toshiaki Yashima, president of Tohoku Electric Power Company, which wants to build the Maki plant, called the vote ''regrettable,'' but said tonight that the company would keep trying to win public support.

With its North Sea oil and gas beginning to dwindle, its nuclear power generation set to be scaled back and its commitment to reducing greenhouse gases propelling a hunt for renewable energy sources -- like tides, waves or wind -- Britain is facing hard decisions that those in authority seem reluctant to take. The most passionate argument is swirling around the contentious prospect of expanding nuclear power, which produces about one quarter of Britain's electricity. ''Gimmicks such as wind turbines are hardly relevant,'' the newspaper columnist Simon Jenkins said recently. ''If Britain's leaders really believe in the apocalypse, only one technology is currently available to hold it at bay and that is nuclear power. All else is hypocrisy.'' The government has been less forthright. In a major speech on climate change in September, Prime Minister Tony Blair said nuclear power remained an option to reduce carbon emissions -- a goal that Britain has adopted with enthusiasm under the Kyoto agreement to cut greenhouse gases. That seemed to suggest nuclear power was back on the agenda. Just a few days later, though, Patricia Hewitt, the minister of trade and industry, said there were ''no proposals now for building new nuclear power stations, but at some point in the future new nuclear build might be necessary if we are to meet our carbon targets.'' Her remarks prompted the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir David King, to warn that time is running out. ''The government is saying we will come back and look at nuclear power when we've seen how well we are doing on energy efficiency gains,'' he told a conference recently. ''But the time scale to do that is relatively short. I do think five years or less is when we've got to make a decision.'' The discussion is part of a wider and patchier debate across Europe since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 provoked such wide opposition to nuclear power that no new reactors have been built since then. Some countries, like Italy, now call themselves nuclear-free zones. While France and Germany remain heavily dependent on nuclear power, Austria and Denmark have forsworn any use of it. Elsewhere there are indications of a rethinking. Finland has ordered a $3.5 billion nuclear reactor, and opposition politicians in Germany have spoken about extending the deadline for closing nuclear plants past 2021. Sweden has generally delayed a promise made in 1980 to phase out nuclear power by 2010, but has now said it will close one of plant. In the United States, no new nuclear plants have been ordered since the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania in 1979. Nuclear power contributes 20.3 percent of the country's electricity needs. At Mrs. White's home in this blustery northwestern corner of England, the energy debate is framed by the competing presence of wind farms on the hillsides and shores -- and a massive nuclear plant just up the road. ''We are an island battered by the wind,'' she said, explaining Britain's aptitude for renewable energy sources like winds, tides and waves. ''We are an island surrounded by the sea.'' But a few miles north of here, also on the coast, stands the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield that has long raised concerns about the costs and hazards of nuclear waste. And just down the road is Barrow in Furness, the home port of two specialist ships that recently carried American plutonium to France, accompanied by protests about the perils of transporting nuclear materials in an era of global terrorism. ''The question with nuclear power is this disposal business,'' Mrs. White said. ''And there's always a huge question mark over it.'' In some ways, the onetime abundance of Britain's North Sea oil and gas in particular allowed it to prevaricate on future energy supplies leaving others to commit themselves to different sources of energy. While Britain claims to be Europe's windiest nation, its wind farms produce only a tiny fraction of its electricity, and Denmark has taken a lead in turbine technology. And, while Britain is committed to reducing its reliance on nuclear power generation, France is deriving 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power. According to the United Kingdom Offshore Operators Association, a body representing the offshore oil and gas industry, oil and gas production in British waters, which peaked at the equivalent of 4.5 million barrels a day in 1999, is likely to be 3.7 million barrels a day this year, falling to 2.5 million barrels a day in 2010. After two decades of self-sufficiency, according to official statistics, Britain now imports more oil than it exports. That has underscored the urgency of the current debate, leading some analysts to speculate that future supplies could be held ransom to developments beyond Britain's control. ''We will be ever more reliant in the future on importing gas and oil from politically sensitive areas such as the Middle East and Russia,'' said Ruth Lea, director of the Center for Policy Studies, a private research body, in a recent newspaper article. Environmentalists have long argued in favor of wind, wave and tide power, and the British Wind Energy Association, a private advocacy group, says the wind turbines sprouting offshore and on hillsides -- despite the protests of opponents -- will provide 8 percent of Britain's electricity supply by 2010. Some people argue that those alternative sources of power are not economically viable while the nuclear industry provides not only electricity, but also jobs. ''Sellafield has been a lifeline to this part of Cumbria,'' Mrs. White said. ''It has brought huge prosperity.'' Indeed, said Ali McKibbin, a spokeswoman for BNFL, the state-owned company that runs Sellafield, over 10,000 people rely for jobs on the nuclear industry around the plant. Against that, wind turbines ''bring very little in the way of direct economic benefit,'' said Stuart Klosinski, a spokesman for Furness Enterprise, a local group seeking economic regeneration in an area that over the years has witnessed the decline of shipbuilding and its other industries. Many of the companies building windmills around here are foreign, from countries including Denmark and the United States, and do not provide long-term local jobs in the manufacture or maintenance of turbines, Mr. Klosinski said. The apparent swing toward nuclear power -- at least in public discussion --has been hastened by remarks from some prominent environmentalists casting doubt on Britain's ability to meet its own targets for replacing fossil fuels with renewable sources of energy. ''Many politicians hope that green, renewable energy will save the day. This is wishful thinking,'' said Prof. Ian Fells, chairman of the New and Renewable Energy Center, a private research organization. Against that, John Whitelegg, a Green Party specialist on sustainable development, said in a letter published in The Times of London, ''The nuclear option is fraught with environmental, human health, financial and terrorism risks.'' Under its commitment to the Kyoto protocol, Britain is supposed to produce 10 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2010 -- more than three times the present level. That is supposed to rise to 15.4 percent by 2015 and to 20 percent by 2020, Mr. Blair said in September. In fact, though, the most effective allies of the antinuclear lobby may turn out to be not so much the advocacy groups and activists as the markets and investors' reluctance to sink money into new plants. In recent years, the mounting cost of nuclear waste disposal has forced both the state-owned BNFL and the beleaguered British Energy into reorganizations to ease the burden of closing aging plants and dealing with the problems of nuclear waste, expected to cost at least $90 billion. In September, the European Union approved a $6 billion bailout for British Energy to stave off bankruptcy. At present, BNFL operates four nuclear power stations, generating about 5 percent of Britain's electricity, and they are set to be closed by 2010, according to a BNFL spokesman. British Energy operates eight nuclear power plants in Britain, accounting for 20 percent of electricity supply, and set to be closed by 2023 -- a deadline that makes the current debate all the more urgent. In the absence of new investment, the situation does not augur well for the nuclear industry, said Graham Meeks, an analyst at Climate Change Capital, which advises potential investors on the energy business. ''We will get a closure of the nuclear program by default,'' he said.",2004-10-09T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business

Although exactly what happened at Japan’s nuclear power plants is still being sorted out, most of the nuclear plants in the United States share some or all of the risk factors that played a role at Fukushima Daiichi: locations on tsunami-prone coastlines or near earthquake faults, aging plants and backup electrical systems that rely on diesel generators and batteries that could fail in extreme circumstances. David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer and the director of the Nuclear Safety Project of the Union of Concerned Scientists, suggested Sunday that while emergency preparedness and safety redundancies were built into the DNA of every nuclear plant in the United States, the string of events that damaged the Fukushima plant was beyond the sort of situations imagined by nuclear regulators and plant designers. “The real situation they found themselves in is not really planned for,” Mr. Lochbaum said. “Those plants are designed to be highly resistant to damage by earthquakes, and as immune as possible to tsunami. The problem was the one-two punch. We design against these sorts of things in isolation, and the combination is a little beyond what they would have anticipated.” On Sunday, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, sent a letter to President Obama calling for a moratorium on new nuclear plants until more coherent federal procedures for nuclear emergencies were ironed out. “In stark contrast to the scenarios contemplated for oil spills and hurricanes, there is no specificity for emergency coordination and command in place for a response to a nuclear disaster,” Mr. Markey said in a statement. Nuclear power provides about 20 percent of the nation’s electricity, and there are 104 reactors licensed to operate in 31 states, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A majority are so-called pressurized water reactors, different from the General Electric boiling water reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. There are 35 G.E. boiling water reactors in the United States, with 31 of them early “Mark 1” or “Mark 2” designs, the type used at Fukushima. Beyond the age of the plant, the relative safety of any one design over another — and perhaps more importantly, the ability to minimize the impact of any emergency on surrounding populations — depends on a wide array of variables, regulators and nuclear experts say. Although the exact sequence of events at the Fukushima plant is still unclear, early assessments suggested that the containment structures weathered last week’s earthquake, but that power from the electric grid was cut off. Nearly all nuclear facilities use backup diesel generators in such situations to maintain control over a reactor, prevent it from overheating by circulating a cooling agent and begin shutting it down. But in this case, the subsequent tsunami may have damaged those generators and other components, forcing the use of another layer of backup, battery power. However, batteries are designed to last only four to eight hours in most cases, just long enough to allow technicians to restore grid or generator power. If there is trouble restoring those power sources, as appears to be the case in Japan, the strategies for cooling the reactor become much more difficult. All nuclear facilities in the United States deploy similar backup strategies, and in a statement Saturday, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that the nation’s nuclear power plants were built to withstand environmental hazards, including earthquakes and tsunamis. “Even those plants that are located outside of areas with extensive seismic activity are designed for safety in the event of such a natural disaster,” the agency said. “The N.R.C. requires that safety-significant structures, systems and components be designed to take into account the most severe natural phenomena historically estimated for the site and surrounding area.” Two nuclear power plants operate in quake-prone California: the two-reactor Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant near San Luis Obispo, operated by Pacific Gas and Electric, and Southern California Edison’s San Onofre plant near Long Beach, which also has two reactors. Both plants use pressurized water reactors. Diablo Canyon has been embroiled in a bitter battle with local opponents seeking new seismic studies ahead of a decision to extend the plant’s operating license, which is due to expire in about 15 years. Opponents point in part to the discovery of a previously unknown fault about a mile offshore. But Paul Flake, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric, said that geological studies —both historical and projected — placed the maximum seismic strength of an earthquake near the plant at 6.1 to 6.5, and that the plant is designed to withstand a quake of up to 7.5 in magnitude. The quake off the coast of Japan measured 8.9. Mr. Lochbaum added that other potential problems exist in nearly every region. “The Midwest has tornadoes, parts of the gulf experience hurricanes. There are places in the North where severe ice has caused problems. They all share the common thread of Mother Nature challenging the plants.” Anthony R. Pietrangelo, a senior vice president and chief nuclear officer with the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade group representing the nuclear power industry, said that the industry was keenly watching the Japanese situation and would readily revisit its own emergency procedures as new information and potential lessons emerged. But he also said the combination of an enormous earthquake and immense tsunami was of historic proportions, and that the odds of it happening in the United States were small. “It’s not impossible, he said, “but it’s extremely remote.”",2011-03-14T04:37:53.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

According to the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, for nuclear power to make a substantial reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, commercial reactors would have to not only supply much of the world's electricity growth but also replace many coal-fired plants as they are retired. This would require the construction of approximately 2,000 nuclear power plants around the world over the next several decades. The main global warming gas, carbon dioxide, is emitted at each step of the nuclear fuel chain, from uranium mining, milling, enrichment, fuel fabrication, construction of the reactor, transportation and storage of radioactive waste, and decommissioning of old reactors. Each of these stages is also a source of radioactive pollution and long-lasting, highly toxic waste.

Should nuclear power be regulated by the Federal Government or the states? Only Washington has the technical expertise and the duty to weigh the national interest. But states including New York and Massachusetts refuse to cooperate in emergency evacuation plans for the plants at Shoreham and Seabrook, effectively blocking their start-ups. The staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission now proposes to remove this veto power. That would be a welcome and overdue step. The states got a foot in the door of nuclear plant licensing after the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission told utilities to prepare to evacuate people from a 10-mile radius around nuclear power plants in the event of a radioactive release. That required the cooperation of local authorities, but it seemed inconceivable to the commission that any would refuse to help prepare its citizens for crisis. Local authorities like Suffolk County and the Governor of New York saw non-cooperation as a weapon against power plants they opposed, especially where the start-up would sharply increase local electric bills. The commission found it had shared its prerogative to license plants with every municipal orator and antinuclear governor. Giving local authorities a veto power over new plants means none will be built. That's a decision that affects the national interest and only Washington should make it. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ceded states this power by regulation, and now proposes to take it back by modifying the regulation. There's no question of usurping states' rights or police powers. All that the commission staff proposes is that plants should be licensed once a reasonable emergency plan has been drawn up, even if the local authorities say they won't cooperate. Fabian Palomino, Governor Cuomo's principal adviser in preventing Shoreham from going on line, says that for the commission even to consider such a step would be ''a shameless act and a total abandonment of any sense of responsibility.'' To the contrary, it's Mr. Cuomo's behavior that compels the commission to rescind the power it assumed the states would handle responsibly. If Congress wants the states to set nuclear policy, let it pass a law.

So when the leading science academies in 20 developed countries, along with several major American corporations and the national security community, all tell us that burning fossil fuels is causing dangerous changes to the climate, we think it’s time for the United States to get serious about clean energy. It also means supporting safely operating nuclear power plants that produce carbon-free electricity. Already, 60 percent of our carbon-free electricity comes from the 99 nuclear reactors that dot the nation’s map, from Avila Beach, Calif., to Seabrook, N.H. These reactors provide low-cost, reliable electricity for the United States, which uses nearly 20 percent of the world’s electricity. But over the next decade, at least eight of these reactors are scheduled to shut down. That will push up carbon emissions from the American electricity sector by nearly 3 percent, according to the United States Energy Information Administration. In California, the closing of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station in 2012 contributed to a 24 percent increase in carbon emissions from the electricity sector, according to data from the California Environmental Protection Agency Air Resources Board. Carbon emissions from the electricity sector in New England rose 5 percent in 2015, the first year-to-year increase since 2010, largely because of the closing of the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station in December 2014, according to ISO New England, the region’s grid operator. In roughly two decades, the United States could lose about half its reactors. That’s because, by 2038, 50 reactors will be at least 60 years old, and will face having to close, representing nearly half of the nuclear generating capacity in the United States. Without them, or enough new reactors to replace them, it will be much harder to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to climate change. Unfortunately, some of our federal policies to encourage clean energy, such as the Clean Energy Incentive Program within President Obama’s Clean Power Plan, do not explicitly include or incentivize nuclear power. Likewise, some states have chosen to adopt policies, such as renewable portfolio standards, that do not include or incentivize nuclear power. At the same time, our energy markets do not currently account for the value of carbon-free power, a failure that puts nuclear power at an unfair and economically inefficient disadvantage to fossil fuels like coal and natural gas. We come from different political parties, but we agree on the overall goal of leveling the playing field for nuclear power, and the need to find a bipartisan solution to achieve it. This matters because the investments we make today, in new plants and transmission infrastructure, will be around for decades. Every time new fossil energy replaces nuclear, we’re locking ourselves in to a more carbon-heavy energy mix for years to come. Some states and utilities are working to reduce carbon emissions with the understanding that nuclear power can be part of the solution. In the Southeast, there are four new reactors under construction that will provide 4,470 megawatts of carbon-free electricity — enough for 3.3 million homes. New York established a clean-energy standard in August that might help the state’s reactors stay open, including one that had been announced as closing. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s office explained that “maintaining zero-emission nuclear power is a critical element to achieving New York’s ambitious climate goals.” And the private sector is pitching in, too: According to Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz, there are dozens of entrepreneurs focusing on ways to improve and expand the nuclear power industry. The federal government should support these efforts. For one thing, we should extend existing reactor licenses from 60 to 80 years, in cases where the Nuclear Regulatory Commission says it is safe to do so. We should also invest more in research to develop advanced nuclear reactors, including small modular reactors and accident-tolerant fuels. Advanced reactor designs may substantially reduce the threat of a meltdown. Many new, modular designs are much smaller than their predecessors, meaning they can be built in factories at lower cost and plugged into the grid as needed. Some of these new reactor technologies could actually use waste from traditional reactors as fuel, helping to alleviate a major challenge facing the industry. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing framework, developed to support the last generation of reactors, should be updated to encourage and promote new investment in the next wave of advanced nuclear technology. And finally, we need to resolve the stalemate over where to store used nuclear reactor fuel. If we want to clean the air and reduce carbon emissions to deal with climate change, we need a stronger, not weaker, nuclear energy sector. Congress, federal agencies and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission must work with utilities to preserve our existing reactors in the safest possible way, and to develop the next generation of reactors that will provide cheaper, reliable, carbon-free electricity.",2016-12-22T01:26:38.000+01:00,NYTIMES,oped-opinion

The workshop, sponsored by the semigovernmental Japan Atomic Energy Agency , started with Radiation Physics 101. The students then collected radiation samples with the help of Japanese specialists and analyzed them in a lab built by Japan. “Nuclear power is important for Vietnam’s energy security, but, like fire, it has two sides,” said one of the students, Nguyen Xuan Thuy, 27. “We have to learn how to take advantage of its good side.” As Vietnam prepares to begin one of the world’s most ambitious nuclear power programs, it is scrambling to raise from scratch a field of experts needed to operate and regulate nuclear power plants. The government, which is beefing up nuclear engineering programs at its universities and sending increasing numbers of young technicians abroad, says Vietnam will have enough qualified experts to safely manage an industry that is scheduled to grow from one nuclear reactor in 2020 to 10 reactors by 2030. But some Vietnamese and foreign experts said that was too little time to establish a credible regulatory body, especially in a country with widespread corruption, poor safety standards and a lack of transparency. They said the overly ambitious timetable could lead to the kind of weak regulation, as well as collusive ties between regulators and operators, that contributed to the disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan last year. Hien Pham Duy, one of Vietnam’s most senior nuclear scientists and an adviser to government agencies overseeing nuclear power, said it had been his “dream for many years” to bring nuclear power to Vietnam. But he said the government’s plans were based on a “lack of vigorous assessment of the inherent problems of nuclear power, especially those arising in less developed countries.” Like many Vietnamese, Mr. Hien, a former director of the Dalat Nuclear Research Institute, which houses Vietnam’s nuclear research reactor, pointed to the high rates of accidents on Vietnam’s roads as the most visible example of a “bad safety culture” that pervaded “every field of activity in the country.” Tran Dai Phuc, a Vietnamese-French nuclear engineer who worked in the French nuclear industry for four decades and is now an adviser to Vietnam’s Ministry of Science and Technology, the ministry in charge of nuclear power, said potential problems were not related to the reactors’ technology but to the lack of “democracy as well as the responsibility of personnel, a culture of quality assurance and general safety regarding installation and impact on the environment.” The Vietnamese government fears that the country’s strong economic growth will be jeopardized without the energy provided by nuclear plants. Vietnam, which relies mostly on hydroelectricity, is expected to become a net importer of energy in 2015. “One of the reasons for the introduction of nuclear power in Vietnam is the shortage of conventional fuel supply sources, including imported,” Le Doan Phac, deputy director general of the Vietnam Atomic Energy Agency, the government’s main nuclear research and development body, said in an e-mail message. Russia and Japan have won bids to build Vietnam’s first two plants; South Korea is expected to be selected for the third. For Japan, the contract was the fruit of years of high-level lobbying by its government and nuclear industry, which is threatened at home by a strong public reaction against nuclear power after the crisis last year. About 500 Vietnamese have gone through workshops by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency since 2001. Toshiba, a plant manufacturer, has also offered one-month courses since 2006 to win the construction contract. Like Russia, which has pledged Vietnam loans of $8 billion to $9 billion to finance the first plant’s construction, Japan is expected to offer a package of low-interest loans through the Japan Bank of International Cooperation. Japan is expected to use its overseas development assistance to Vietnam to build roads, ports and other infrastructure to support the nuclear plant. With the memories of the Fukushima disaster still raw in Japan, the Japanese government’s active role in selling nuclear plants to developing nations like Vietnam has drawn sharp criticism. Critics say that the government and nuclear industry’s joint efforts are reminiscent of the kind of collusive ties that led to the Fukushima disaster. The government’s low-interest loans — taxpayers’ money — will benefit only politically connected plant manufacturers, they say. “When it comes to selling nuclear plants, it’s not a commercially viable business, so you invariably need the injection of public funds,” said Kanna Mitsuta, a researcher for both Friends of the Earth Japan and Mekong Watch , a Japanese private organization. Critics said that Japan and other nuclear powers were desperate to sell plants to developing nations as dreams of a nuclear renaissance in advanced economies have dried up since the Fukushima disaster. After the Fukushima disaster, Tokyo abandoned plans to build 14 more reactors in Japan by 2030. Japan had 54 reactors before the disaster, but growing public opposition has now idled all but two. “I don’t understand why Japan is striving to export to less developed countries something it’s rejected at home,” Mr. Hien, the nuclear scientist, said. Japanese supporters of exports say that developing nations like Vietnam have the right to choose nuclear power to expand their economies, just as Japan did decades ago. “They’ll just buy from another country” if Japan decides not to sell them nuclear plants, said Tadashi Maeda, an official at the Japan Bank of International Cooperation and a special adviser to the prime minister’s cabinet. Human error contributed to the Fukushima disaster, Mr. Maeda said. But he added that unlike Japan, which was operating aging reactors at Fukushima, Vietnam will be receiving “state-of-the art reactors whose technological and safety level was completely different.” But Mr. Tran, the Vietnamese-French adviser, said he harbored no doubts about Japanese technology. “That isn’t why we’re worried,” he said, pointing instead to Vietnam’s capacity to manage and regulate one of the world’s most complex industries. “It’s the politics of management. When a nuclear reactor is running, the regulators must be independent and firm and vigilant.” Vietnam will need hundreds of experts with years of experience to regulate its nuclear industry, Mr. Tran said. In the Vietnam Agency for Radiation and Nuclear Safety, the main regulatory authority, “There are currently only 30 people qualified to analyze safety reports with some assistance of experts,” he said. In Tai An, the village in central Vietnam selected as the site for the Japanese nuclear plant, about half a dozen randomly interviewed residents said they were anxious about plans to relocate the village’s 700 households to a spot a couple of miles north. The villagers, most of whom are fishermen or grape growers, said earnings from farming had sharply increased in recent years since Tai An was connected to running water from a new reservoir nearby. They said they feared that the new location’s proximity to a nuclear plant would jeopardize their grape farming and fishing. “I don’t know anything about nuclear plants,” said Pham Phong, 43, a grape farmer who, in one of the most telling examples of rising incomes in Southeast Asia, upgraded from a cheap Chinese-made motorcycle to a shiny new Japanese Yamaha late last year. “But I saw Fukushima on television, and I’m worried.”",2012-03-02T02:21:58.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The group, which calls itself the Coalition of Environmental/Safe Energy Organizations, also expressed concern over five plutonium-manufacturing plants operated by the Energy Department that are the only nuclear plants in the United States that do not have containment structures to prevent the release of radioactivity in the event of an accident. The Soviet reactor, the Chernobyl station at the town of Pripyat in the Ukraine, did not have a containment structure. The coalition said there were four such plants on the Savannah River near Aiken, S.C., and one in Hanford, Wash. Gail Bradshaw, an Energy Department spokesman, confirmed that these plants did not have containment structures, but she said that they had other features to prevent the release of radioactivity. Filters for Radioactivity Utility plants operate at high pressures and temperatures to produce steam and generate electricity, Miss Bradshaw said, while the Energy Department plants, which produce plutonium for nuclear weapons and conduct research, operate at relatively low temperatures and pressure, relying on filters to remove any radioactive material that might be discharged. Scott W. Peters, a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Forum, a trade association, said of the coalition's call to phase out American nuclear power plants: ''I think that is just not a viable thing. Why should 15 percent of our electrical capacity be shut down because of something that happened with a different kind of reactor without a containment structure?'' The Soviet plant where the accident occurred is a graphite-moderated reactor, in which the graphite, like water in a standard American reactor, serves to slow the neutrons enough so a chain reaction cannot occur. There are only two graphite-moderated nuclear power plants in the United States; the other American plants are water-moderated. Some of the groups in the coalition had called for such closedowns in the past. Others, especially environmental organizations, had not addressed the question before today. Compromise on Phase-Out Since some of the groups opposed a call for an immediate shutdown of nuclear power plants, a compromise was worked out in which they agreed that a phase-out in the use of nuclear power was already under way because such plants were becoming uneconomical. ''We should accelerate this phase-out through a transition to least-cost energy planning and environmentally sound energy technologies,'' the coalition said. ''As long as there are operating nuclear power plants in the United States, we live with the risk of a similar accident here.'' Mr. Scott said his organization, which represents reactor makers, utilities and construction unions, still regarded reactors as safe producers of economically competitive electricity. Despite that, he acknowledged that the Soviet accident would set back the American nuclear industry. ''It's got to have a substantial effect on nuclear policy, worldwide, because of emotion,'' Mr. Scott said. The coalition asserted that the adverse effect would be caused by American's dawning realization that nuclear energy was not safe. 'The Same Potential Risk' ''This is a reminder of the inherent danger of nuclear power,'' said Ellen Weiss, general counsel of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group that has raised questions over the years about the safety of nuclear power. ''All reactors hold the same potential risk. It is nonsense to say an accident can't happen. This danger respects no borders.'' Noting that the Soviet accident occurred near a heavily populated area, Kitty Tucker, executive director of the Health & Energy Institute, said the lesson should be one of potentially serious ramifications for nuclear plants near population centers in the United States. For the virtually complete nuclear plant at Shoreham, on the east end of Long Island, Miss Tucker noted that local officials were refusing to take part in an evacuation drill as a precaution against a nuclear accident. They were refusing, she said, because evacuation from Long Island ''would be impossible.'' Indian Point Plant Similarly, she said, evacuation of New York City would be impossible in the event of a nuclear accident at the Indian Point plant on the Hudson River, less than 30 miles from midtown Manhattan. Paul Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, said, ''The issue for Shoreham has to be evacuation in the event of a nuclear accident.'' He said this would be impossible since Long Island is surrounded on the north, east and south by water, and hemmed in on the west by heavy concentrations of population and traffic in Brooklyn and Queens. ''Much of the problem is psychological,'' said Mr. Leventhal, whose group is mainly concerned with the spread of nuclear weapons but is also troubled by such threats as terrorist attacks on nuclear utilities. The Coalition of Enviromental/Safe Energy Organizations reached agreement on three other points: * The Soviet Union should fully and immediately disclose everything that is known about the Chernobyl accident. * An independent organization, such as the World Health Organization, should evaluate the short- and long-term health effects of the accident. * Congress and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission should halt efforts to deregulate the nuclear power industry. Robert Alvarez, director of the Nuclear Power and Weapons Project, said normal wind currents could bring fallout to the West Coast of the United States in three or four days. ''The fallout would be troublesome in areas of high rainfall, possibly in the Soviet Union and possibly in Scandinavia,'' he said. ''Once it reached the United States, it could be very much dilute.''

The instructions were intended to ''enhance the reliability and safety'' of nuclear power plant operations, according to the official, Gennadi A. Veretennikov. He said the directives covered unspecified ''organizational measures'' and called for ''maximum control over the operation of all systems and equipment.'' Mr. Veretennikov also affirmed the Soviet Government's determination to push ahead with its ambitious nuclear power program. He said any findings of the Government commission investigating the causes of the Chernobyl accident would be taken into account in plans and in modifying reactor designs. Any changes in the nuclear program as a result of Chernobyl may become evident next month when the Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament, meets to enact the final version of the new five-year plan (1986-90). The preliminary guidelines of the plan were approved at the Communist Party congress in early March. Interview Printed May 14 The Soviet nuclear power chief spoke in an interview published May 14 by the Moscow newspaper Stroitelnaya Gazeta, which is the national paper of the construction industry. The Soviet Union has not disclosed the specific causes of the explosion and fire that damaged Unit 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear station in the Ukraine in the early hours of April 26. Mr. Veretennikov, a former official of the State Planning Committee, took charge of the nuclear power industry in August 1983 during a high-level management shake-up. He is a Deputy Minister of Electric Power and head of the National Nuclear Power Corporation, a ministry division that constructs and operates nuclear generating stations. The Government corporation is known by the Russian acronym Soyuzatomenergo. When asked in the interview about any ''lessons of Chernobyl,'' Mr. Veretennikov said: ''Of course, the situation at the Chernobyl station will be a matter of careful study. The nuclear power industry is being improved from year to year by all the experience being accumulated in the Soviet Union and abroad, both positive and negative. ''The results of our investigation of the accident will be reflected in existing designs and the plans for the future. Nuclear power will continue to develop in the Soviet Union as part of the longterm energy program.'' #28,000-Megawatt Capacity Before the Chernobyl accident, the Soviet Union had 37 large civilian power reactors in operation, with a combined generating capacity of 28,000 megawatts. As a rule of thumb, 1,000 megawatts is sufficient to supply electricity to a city of a million people. Seventeen of the Soviet power reactors, including the damaged Chernobyl unit, are of the graphite type, in which a graphite core acts as the moderator that slows down the high-energy neutrons to produce a controlled chain reaction. Most other Soviet reactors are of the pressurized-water type, which is also familiar in the United States and uses water as the moderator. The Soviet Union has also been developing breeder reactors, which in addition to generating energy create additional fuel by producing more fissionable material than they consume. A 600-megawatt breeder has been in operation at the Beloyarsky station in the Urals since 1980, and a 800-megawatt unit is under construction there. Under the five-year plan guidelines approved earlier this year, the Soviet Union was to add 41,000 megawatts of nuclear generating capacity by the end of 1990.",1986-05-25T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world

Experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which reports to the United Nations and is based in Vienna, were in Japan at the request of the government to review stress tests ordered by the country’s nuclear regulator on reactors across the nation. The government is eager to dispel public mistrust of nuclear power and restart the reactors, which until recently provided 30 percent of Japan’s electricity needs. But because of heightened local opposition to nuclear power after the meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station nearly a year ago, communities across Japan that host reactors have blocked them from restarting after mandatory shutdowns required every year for maintenance. Only 3 of the country’s 54 nuclear reactors are operating, and the rest are likely to be halted in the coming months, raising fears of a power shortage during peak summer months. In a bid to quell those fears, Japan’s nuclear regulator, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, has ordered the country’s nuclear operators to conduct stress tests, or computer simulations that analyze whether a reactor can withstand disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis. In January, the agency said it had reviewed stress tests conducted on two reactors at the Ohi Nuclear Power Plant, in central Japan, and concluded that the plant would survive a disaster similar to the magnitude 9.0 earthquake that jolted eastern Japan in March and set off a tsunami. More than 22,000 people have been listed as dead or missing in connection with the earthquake and tsunami. In its preliminary assessment released on Tuesday, the I.A.E.A. said those checks met the agency’s safety standards. Japanese regulators’ checks of emergency measures at the plant were “appropriate and enhanced confidence” in the reactors’ resilience to disasters, the agency said in a statement. It also issued a list of recommendations for earthquake-prone Japan, including a more detailed analysis of the risks caused by earthquakes and tsunamis. “What we saw was a process that we felt comfortable with. But in any process, there is always room for improvement,” said James Lyons, leader of the eight-person team. The preliminary report yielded few details of the contingency measures the atomic agency had deemed sufficient. Japan’s nuclear operators have promised higher sea walls at their plants to protect against tsunamis, as well as better ways to prevent power station blackouts, which can shut off vital cooling systems and cause the reactors’ cores to overheat. The I.A.E.A.’s spokesman, Greg Webb, also emphasized that the agency was not vouching for the absolute safety of nuclear power plants in Japan, or whether they were a good fit for the nation. “We could never do that,” Mr. Webb said. “You can never be complacent about nuclear safety.” It was up to Japan to weigh the risks and benefits of nuclear power to determine whether it should form part of the nation’s energy supply, he said. Even if it restarts its idled reactors, Japan has said it will eventually phase out nuclear power. That could take a long time: recently proposed legislation, if enacted, could allow some reactors to operate for as long as 60 years. The atomic agency is scheduled to submit a final report on its findings to the Japanese government by the end of February.",2012-01-31T12:50:39.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Poland wants a fleet of smaller nuclear power stations to help end its reliance on coal. Britain is betting on Rolls-Royce to produce cheap modular reactors to complement wind and solar energy. And in France, President Emmanuel Macron plans to build on the nation’s huge nuclear program. As world leaders pledge to avert a climate catastrophe, the nuclear industry sees an opportunity for a revival. Sidelined for years after the disasters at Fukushima and Chernobyl, advocates are wrangling to win recognition of nuclear energy, alongside solar and wind, as an acceptable source of clean power. More than half a dozen European countries recently announced plans to build a new generation of nuclear reactors. Some are smaller and cheaper than older designs, occupying the space of two football fields and costing a fraction of the price of standard nuclear plants.

That’s because the nuclear industry has long been hobbled by two problems that its boosters can’t really wish away: Nuclear is far slower to build than most other forms of power, and it’s far more expensive, too. And now there is a third problem on the horizon. As battery technology improves and the price of electricity storage plummets, nuclear may be way too late, too — with much of its value eclipsed by cheaper, faster and more flexible renewable power technologies. In order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels — the goal set in the Paris Agreement to avert the worst effects of global warming — experts say that we need to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions to a net of zero by 2050. Responding to such a climate emergency with nuclear power is like calling on a sloth to put out a house fire. The 63 nuclear reactors that went into service around the world between 2011 and 2020 took an average of around 10 years to build. By comparison, solar and wind farms can be built in months; in 2020 and 2021 alone, the world added 464 gigawatts of wind and solar power-generation capacity, which is more power than can be generated by all the nuclear plants operating in the world today. The nuclear industry has been notorious for cost overruns and delays. The only nuclear reactors under construction in the United States — a Westinghouse project at the Plant Vogtle power station in Georgia — were started in 2013 and projected to be finished in 2017. They are still not done — and an initial budget of $14 billion has more than doubled to over $28 billion. In 2017, utilities in South Carolina canceled two reactors midway through construction after cost projections ballooned from $11.5 billion to more than $25 billion. And after all this build time, you get a very expensive source of energy. In a common energy industry measure known as “levelized cost,” nuclear’s minimum price is about $131 per megawatt-hour, which is at least twice the price of natural gas and coal, and four times the cost of utility-scale solar and onshore wind power installations. And the high price of nuclear power doesn’t include its extraneous costs, such as the staggering price of disasters. Cleanup and other costs for the 2011 Fukushima disaster, caused by an earthquake and a tsunami off the Japanese coast, may approach a trillion dollars.",2022-09-17T03:43:17.000+02:00,NYTIMES,globalhome

Power plants would become safer if the 29 countries that operate them accepted common and binding safety standards, Sergei V. Kiriyenko, the director of the Russian state nuclear company Rosatom, said at a briefing for journalists Wednesday in Moscow. These countries should also commit to detailed procedures for releasing information about a leak, given the propensity of radiation to float across borders, Mr. Kiriyenko said. The third proposal calls for governments to commit to taking the lead in responding to accidents. That would supplant the role typically taken by the operator or owner of a power plant. Governments, under the proposal, would intervene once a disaster passed Level 4 on the International Atomic Energy Agency’s ’ seven-level scale of nuclear disasters. Level 4 is defined as an “accident with local consequences,” while Level 5 is an “accident with wider consequences.” In laying out these ideas, which Russia plans to present to the Group of 8 industrialized nations at a meeting this spring in France, Mr. Kiriyenko elaborated on a proposal announced Tuesday by the Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, at a ceremony observing the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. The setting for that ceremony, near the ruins of the reactor, couched the Russian proposal as a magnanimous effort — the latest of many — to share the lessons of Chernobyl with a world at risk of nuclear blunders. Russia is also deeply invested in the continued global expansion of nuclear power, because it exports uranium fuel and reactor technology. Vast commercial interests are tied up in the continued adoption of nuclear power and development of reactors, particularly in emerging markets, which are the primary customers of Russia’s nuclear exports. Those business prospects help make Russia particularly committed to improving safety, rather than letting demand disappear in a din of protests against nuclear power. The Russians say they are now building more nuclear power plants than any other country, or 15 of the 60 new reactors under construction around the world today. Rosatom says it has an additional 30 firm orders for reactors and plans to sell more. Rosatom sells reactors for $2 billion to $5 billion. A subsidiary, Tvel, exports about $3 billion worth of low-enriched uranium fuel each year, or about 17 percent of global demand. Some of that market is already drying up. Germany will close seven aging plants ahead of schedule, and Italy has extended indefinitely a moratorium on building plants. Mr. Medvedev’s proposal, though announced in Chernobyl, may have been aimed at seizing some initiative in the public debate to restore confidence in the technology, more than at making a significant contribution to safety. The proposal is intended to amend several decades-old global treaties, like the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage of 1963, to render International Atomic Energy Agency safety standards binding on the countries with civilian nuclear power plants. Jeremy Gordon, an analyst with the World Nuclear Association , a trade group in London, said most national nuclear regulators already adhered to International Atomic Energy Agency standards, making it unclear why they would need to be made binding. “Anybody who is using nuclear power in a serious way is already well within those guidelines,” he said. Of the Russian proposal, he added, “I could not put my finger on a concrete change that would make.” For now, safety recommendations set by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Vienna-based group known for its work to prevent the proliferation of bomb-making knowledge and materials, are voluntary for most countries. This is in contrast to nonproliferation rules, which are enforced by agency inspections and come under treaty obligations.",2011-04-29T01:19:53.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-global-business

A British inquiry begun four years ago decided today on the basis of 55 tons of evidence to go ahead with a new generation of nuclear power stations. The building of American-style pressurized-water reactors to increase Britain's nuclear power capacity has long been endorsed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. After the report today, approval of a planned nuclear station at Sizewell, on the East Anglian coast, is expected to be little more than a formality. But the 3,000-page report by Sir Frank Layfield, issued after Britain's longest public inquiry, was promptly attacked by the antinuclear lobby, trade unions and opposition parties. It comes at a time when Britons have associated the nuclear industry with the Chernobyl accident in the Soviet Union last year and with a critical report last month on Britain's nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, which has had repeated radioactive leaks. Accordingly, a go-ahead decision by the Government could be politically risky in a year when a general election is expected. Sir Frank, a 65-year-old lawyer who specializes in planning law, rendered his conclusions in broad terms. He was skeptical of some of the assumptions made by the Central Electricity Generating Board, the Government agency pushing for the nuclear reactor at Sizewell, such as its estimates of cost savings from nuclear power compared with oil or coal. Yet overall, Sir Frank agreed with the board that pressurized-water reactors would be safe, efficient and necessary in light of future electrical power demands in Britain. ''In my judgment,'' Sir Frank said, ''the expected national economic benefits are sufficient to justify the risks that would be incurred.'' The safety risks were expressed in terms of probabilities. ''It is likely that no member of the public will be killed by the Sizewell B station, either in the United Kingdom or elsewhere,'' Sir Frank stated. However, he did conclude that the risks would be greater for power station workers, though still small from a statistical standpoint. ''My best estimate is that one or two workers at the station would die of radiation-induced cancer, and one worker would die of operational causes other than radiation exposure during the lifetime of the station,'' he said. Among the critics of the report, William Rodgers, spokesman for the Social Democratic and Liberal Party alliance on energy issues, said it would be ''highly irresponsible'' for the Government to approve the Sizewell plant before the coming general election. Business groups hailed the report as encouraging for the depressed nuclear industry, while municipal officials in the Sizewell area started calling for Government compensation for disruption to the local environment. The plant, if approved, would begin operating in the mid-1990's. Trade unions are divided on nuclear power. Politically, the union movement is left-leaning on this issue and others, but the construction unions benefit from nuclear-plant projects. At present, Britain has 12 nuclear power stations, supplying about 19 percent of the electrical power needs. But none of these are American-style pressurized-water reactors. Instead, Britain decided in the 1960's to produce its own advanced gas-cooled reactors. The so-called AGR stations have been plagued with technical problems, often generating only 60 percent of capacity. Once a leader in nuclear expertise, Britain now lags behind other European nations, notably France, which derives two-thirds of its electricity from nuclear power. David Henderson, chief economist of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, has called Britain's AGR choice one of the ''worst civil investment decisions in the history of mankind.'' The frontrunner to supply the technology for a British pressurized-water reactor is the Westinghouse Corporation, though an estimated 90 percent of the work would be done by British concerns.",1987-01-27T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,world

Credit... Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters All three nuclear power plants under Ukrainian control are back online and will soon be producing energy at normal capacity, the head of the national energy utility said on Friday, two days after Russian missile strikes that forced utility crews to scramble to stabilize the country’s crippled energy grid and raised further concerns about the nuclear perils of the war. Ukraine typically relies on nuclear power for more than half of its energy, an uncommonly high rate of dependence. The Russian attacks on Wednesday triggered emergency protections at the three plants and required a halt to production. “Now the energy system is fully integrated; all regions are connected,” said Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the chief executive officer of Ukrenergo, the national utility. He added that utility crews are prepared to react to further Russian attacks, but urged consumers to save electricity. On Friday morning, electricity had been restored to meet about 70 percent of the country’s needs but rolling blackouts remained in place, Ukrenergo said in a statement posted on the Telegram messaging app. “Priority was given to critical infrastructure facilities in all regions,” the statement said, adding that efforts to reconnect household consumers were ongoing in “sub-zero” temperatures. The city government in Kyiv, the capital, said on Friday morning that water had been fully restored but that half of the city’s housing stock was still in emergency power outage mode. Without electricity, taps run dry, water purification becomes unreliable, and wastewater is either not collected or has to be disposed of untreated. Wednesday marked the first time in the 40-year history of the country’s nuclear power industry that all operating nuclear facilities were shut down and had to rely on emergency diesel generators, officials said For months, attacks in and around the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have left engineers racing from one crisis to the next as it has repeatedly been disconnected from the national energy grid. External power was restored on Thursday morning at the plant a day after it was lost, according to the United Nation’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has had inspectors at the facility since early September. That plant, Europe’s largest, has been offline since September but still needs electricity to keep cooling equipment running around the clock and ward off a nuclear meltdown. “The complete and simultaneous loss of off-site power for Ukraine’s nuclear power plants shows that the situation for nuclear safety and security in the country is become increasingly precarious, challenging and potentially dangerous,” Rafael Grossi, the U.N. agency’s director general, said on Thursday. “This would have been completely unimaginable before this tragic war. It is extremely concerning.” The agency has started providing assistance at Ukraine’s other nuclear power plants after it was requested by Kyiv, Mr. Grossi said. “We must do everything to prevent a nuclear accident at any of these facilities, which would only add to the terrible suffering we are already witnessing in Ukraine,” he said. Snow and freezing rain worsened the plight of millions of Ukrainians who were without power on Thursday evening. “Energy workers, utility workers, business — everyone is doing their part to give light again,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in his nightly address. “This is truly a nationwide task — Ukraine is working as unitedly as possible in this.”",2022-11-25T15:03:48.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Medvedev said Friday that Russia planned to build the first nuclear power plant in Venezuela, and that the United States should not object because Russia’s intentions were “absolutely pure and open.” The deal was announced during a state visit to Moscow by Venezuela’s president, Hugo Chávez, and is in keeping with a push by Russian businesses to expand sales of reactors and nuclear fuel around the world. Just in August, Russia completed work on Iran’s first nuclear power plant. “I don’t know who will shudder at this,” Mr. Medvedev said at a meeting with Mr. Chávez, coyly noting the possibility of American concerns about transferring nuclear technology to Mr. Chávez’s government, which has long been at odds with the United States. Venezuela, like Iran, is brimming with energy from oil and natural gas, possibly raising concerns about its motives. “The president said there will be countries in which this will provoke different emotions, but I want to say specially that our intentions are absolutely pure and open,” Mr. Medvedev said. Mr. Chávez was here to negotiate a variety of oil and other economic deals, in addition to the nuclear agreement. Energy officials from both countries also signed an inter-governmental agreement approving BP’s plan to sell assets in Venezuela to a Russian joint venture, a sale intended to help pay gulf spill lawsuits. Russia first offered Venezuela nuclear power in 2008 , during an intense spell of anti-Western sentiment in Moscow after the war with Georgia. The agreement on Friday fleshed out that offer. It specified that the Russian state nuclear power company, Rosatom, would build one nuclear plant with two large pressurized water reactors to generate power, and one small research reactor to make medical isotopes and what was described as nuclear materials that could be useful as pesticides for agriculture. Mr. Medvedev said Friday that Russia would help Venezuela build “an entire range of energy opportunities.” He added that “even such an oil- and gas-rich country as Venezuela needs new sources of energy.” The timing on the deal was vague, and it remains unclear whether the cost and scientific expertise for a nuclear program are outside of Venezuela’s reach, even with Russian help. In comments Friday, Sergei V. Kiriyenko, the chief executive of Rosatom, left open a wide range of possibilities for when Russia might begin work on a new nuclear power plant. “It could be in ten years; it could be sooner,” Mr. Kiriyenko said, adding that the smaller research reactor would be the priority for now. The deepening of Russia’s nuclear cooperation with Venezuela marks only one of dozens of nuclear deals for Russia in recent years. Russia’s commercial interests lie in building nuclear power reactors and selling fuel around the world. As a legacy of the cold war, Russia has 40 percent of the world’s uranium enrichment capacity, far more than it needs for its domestic industry. After the meetings on Friday, Mr. Chávez promoted some trade opportunities of his own. At a news conference with the Russian president, he pulled out a chocolate bar and a bottle of jam made of bananas, and suggested that Russians might like to try those Venezuelan products.",2010-10-16T04:01:22.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-americas

On Tuesday, Maine's voters will settle the year's most hotly debated argument: whether the state's only nuclear power plant should be forced to close by next July. If voters decide the plant should close, it would be the first time a state has forced the closing of a nuclear power plant, both sides say. Maine Yankee, a 840-megawatt plant in Wiscasset, was one of the nation's first nuclear power plants when it began producing electricity for Maine and other parts of New England in 1972. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted the plant a permit that allows it to operate until 2008 and has never cited the plant for a major safety violation. The referendum Tuesday marks the third vote in seven years on whether to close Maine Yankee, which now generates 27 percent of the state's electricity. Voters previously said the plant should remain open, in 1980 by a margin of 60 to 40 and in 1982 by a margin of 56 to 44. Concern About Waste Dump But this year the Maine Nuclear Referendum Committee, which collected the 53,000 signatures on petitions that placed the issue on the ballot, is confident it will win. A major reason for the group's optimism is that the debate has focused on a highly emotional issue here: the disposal of nuclear waste and the possibility that Maine will be chosen as the site of a national nuclear waste dump. But a recent poll by The Bangor Daily News indicated that supporters of the plant were ahead by 10 percentage points. Proponents say more than 400 businesses in Maine as well as labor unions, farmers organizations and chambers of commerce are in favor of keeping the plant in operation. One group that supports the plant, People for Maine Yankee's Electricity, has spent nearly $4.7 million on the campaign, 90 percent of which came from the utility companies. That compares with $500,000 spent by the referendum committee, which has largely raised its money through private donations and from environmental groups. Alva Morrison, a spokesman for the referendum committee, said his group had mainly focused attention on the issue of waste produced by the plant because nuclear power advocates ''don't know what they're doing with nuclear waste.'' 'The Most Toxic Poison' ''Nuclear waste is the most toxic poison that's ever been generated on the face of the earth,'' he said, ''and there is no safe way to dispose of it. And as if that weren't enough, we may also be the repository for the nation's nuclear waste. There is absolutely a close connection between the politics of waste dump siting and making waste.'' Supporters of the plant and the Federal Department of Energy say there is no connection. Just because Maine has a nuclear power plant does not mean it will end up being chosen by the Federal Government as the home of a high-level nuclear waste disposal facility, they say. The Energy Department, which is looking for two sites to build nuclear waste dumps, one in the East and the other in the West, has identified two possible locations in Maine. All told, 12 sites are being considered in seven states in the eastern part of the country. Dispute on Economic Impact ''We're talking about closing our largest and least expensive source of power,'' said Robert Deis, a spokesman for People for Maine Yankee's Electricity. ''It would have a serious economic impact.'' Mr. Deis said that 3,500 people, including 400 at Maine Yankee, would lose their jobs if the plant closed and that power company customers would have to pay $1 billion to $2 billion more over the next 20 years for replacement power. Mr. Morrison, the spokesman for the opponents of Main Yankee, said he doubted that the closing of the plant would have a serious economic impact. He said that the cost of producing electricity was growing as the plant aged and that by closing the plant Maine residents would save up to $1 billion in disposal costs for nuclear waste created over the next 20 years.",1987-11-02T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

Mr. Blair's announcement reflected a nascent European debate that could presage a significant shift in energy policies. Finland in particular has already broken ranks with the opposition to nuclear power that has seized much of the Continent since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. And while France derives around 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power, countries like Germany and Britain may be poised to re-evaluate their previous pledges to phase out nuclear power by the early 2020's. Mr. Blair said Britain would make its decision by next summer. As Mr. Blair spoke at an employers' meeting here, he was disrupted by two men wearing fluorescent yellow jackets over dark business suits who clambered into the steel rafters of the auditorium to start a protest by the environmental group Greenpeace. They carried banners saying ''Nuclear: wrong answer'' and scattered similar messages on ticker tape onto the crowd below. Greenpeace said the protest was the beginning of a ''fight back against a new nuclear era'' by preventing Mr. Blair from speaking. The protesters refused to abandon their perches, insisting that they wished to make a 10-minute speech to participants in the annual meeting of the Confederation of British Industry, a leading employers' group. '''I'm not prepared to accept that,'' said Digby Jones, the head of the Confederation. ''I don't give in to ultimatums.'' Mr. Blair, regarded as an undeclared supporter of nuclear power, was forced to address business leaders in a cramped side room, surrounded by reporters and photographers. ''This is going to be a surreal occasion,'' Mr. Blair said. ''I'm going to give this speech if it's the last thing I do.'' ''Like most tough issues, what we actually need is an open and democratic debate, not one conducted by protests and demonstrations to stop people having the freedom to express their views,'' he said. The two protesters, identified by Greenpeace as Huw Williams and Nyls Verhauelt, had apparently infiltrated the building with unauthorized identification passes, the organizers said. They were later arrested. Their action recalled other demonstrations in recent years by people supporting hunting and fathers' rights who breached security systems at the House of Commons and Buckingham Palace. Mr. Blair's speech had been widely expected as the trigger for a new energy debate only two years after the British authorities resolved to increase the use of renewable sources such as wind power to supply 10 percent of the country's needs by 2010 and 20 percent by 2020. At the same time, Britain's coal and nuclear power stations, currently accounting for around one-third of its electricity, would be phased out gradually by 2023. ''The issue back on the agenda with a vengeance is energy policy,'' Mr. Blair said. ''Round the world you can see feverish rethinking. Energy prices have risen. Energy supply is under threat. Climate change is producing a sense of urgency.'' Britain's looming energy crisis is depicted here as potentially acute because the country, which long relied on its North Sea reserves of oil and gas, has now become a net importer of both. Mr. Blair said Britain's latest policy review ''will include specifically the issues of whether we facilitate the development of a new generation of nuclear power stations.'' Opponents of nuclear power argue that it is costly, potentially dangerous, vulnerable to terrorist attack and dogged by the difficulties of nuclear waste disposal. Advocates maintain that nuclear power plants produce clean and cheap fuel, reducing emissions of so-called greenhouse gases. In the United States, no new nuclear plants have been ordered since the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania in 1979. Nuclear power contributes around one-fifth of the country's electricity needs.",2005-11-30T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,world

Even now, Soviet engineers may not fully understand what is going on in the stricken reactor or even when the accident will be over. As the tragedy unfolds, it prompts many people, not just committed opponents, to reconsider the risks and benefits of nuclear energy. Can more Chernobyls be prevented? If not, is nuclear power worth such a price? Or is the fire that lights the stars too fierce for human hands? There are now 361 nuclear reactors operating in the world, with 175 more under construction. Whatever the specific reasons for the accident at Chernobyl, reactors outside the Soviet Union have not had a comforting safety record either. In America, competence varies widely among nuclear utilities, and their guardian, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is often criticized for leniency. The 1979 accident at Three Mile Island showed that a core could suffer partial meltdown, even though the containment vessel confined almost all radioactivity. But perilous safety lapses have continued to occur, as at New Jersey's Salem 2 in February 1983, and Ohio's Davis-Besse plant only last June. Do such accidents mean that all nuclear reactors should be closed? No. Many have long records of safe, economic operation. Instead of an alarmed rush to ban all of them, the more reasonable response would be to scrutinize the plants with the weakest safety records and those that are sited, regrettably, near large populations, like New York's Indian Point and Chicago's Zion. In the wake of Chernobyl, higher confidence in their safety may be required. Nuclear safety would be even more pressing if nuclear power were more needed. In America, it isn't, at least not yet. No new nuclear power plant has been ordered since 1978 because reactors cost too much to build and the demand for electric power has leveled off. Even when demand picks up, the present generation of nuclear reactors will be the most expensive way to meet it. Far cheaper is conservation. Consumers still use electricity recklessly because they don't pay for the true cost of building extra generating capacity. There's too little incentive for energy-efficient appliances and other conservation steps. New pricing structures could quickly induce New Yorkers to buy energy-efficient air conditioners and insulated refrigerators. That would soon obviate the need for a new power plant. Even if America could, with its abundance of natural resources, put off new nuclear plants for years, someday we'll need more electricity. There's little sense in arbitrarily ruling out nuclear power. A new generation of reactors, designed with inherent safety and built in standardized form, could play a useful role. It's easy to forget, in the shadow of Chernobyl, that safe nuclear reactors are environmentally benign. They don't acidify the rain, or produce gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect, a feared global warming of the earth's atmosphere. Now is the time to start developing them. Better for America to have a nuclear option and not need it than need it and not have it. Other countries will make their own choices. Those like France, whose electricity is 65 percent nuclear, won't abandon their commitment: they have little alternative. Like American utilities, they will tend to see Chernobyl as specific to Soviet design. The future lesson of Chernobyl is likely to be more safety, not the abandonment of nuclear power. The lesson in retrospect is little different: A technology so hard for human institutions to manage should have been designed from the start with inherent safety. Nuclear fire may seem a doubtful gift, but it's still too early to assume it can't be safely handled.",1986-05-11T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,editorial-desk-opinion

Goldstein and Staffan A. Qvist Some years ago, while studying how societies transitioned from one energy source to another over the past 200 years, the Italian physicist Cesare Marchetti and his colleagues discovered a hard truth: It takes almost a century for a new source of primary energy — coal, petroleum, natural gas, nuclear power — to command half the world market. Just to grow to 10 percent from 1 percent takes almost 50 years. You would expect suppliers to switch quickly to a better (more abundant, cheaper, cleaner) source. But infrastructure has to catch up: In America, natural gas needed long-distance pipelines to go national; electric cars need still-scarce charging stations. People have to adapt: Elizabethan preachers condemned coal as literally the Devil’s excrement; some Victorian homeowners comfortable with gaslight thought Edison’s light bulbs too bright. Competition from heavily invested older sources has to be overcome, as with fossil fuels today. These and other changes take time. Today, with global temperatures rising, time is running short. That’s the starting point of Joshua Goldstein and Staffan Qvist’s smart new study of how we can move away from fossil fuels. A double burden compounds the problem. We have to limit any further increase in greenhouse gas production, as the 2018 Paris Agreement specifies. But this isn’t enough. “Decarbonization,” the authors write, “requires both replacing existing fossil fuels and meeting new demand from carbon-free sources.” That second challenge has hardly yet been addressed. It must be, especially given the increasing prosperity of the developing regions — China, India, Africa — which the authors correctly say both “want more energy” and “have a moral right to it.” As a consequence, worldwide energy consumption 30 years from now is projected to be about 50 percent higher than it is today. If that number sounds exaggerated, think of four billion Asians installing air-conditioning. For Goldstein (an emeritus professor of international relations) and Qvist (a Swedish engineer), the only possible solution to this double dilemma is a rapid, worldwide expansion of nuclear power. No other source or collection of sources of energy, they argue, is positioned to meet these challenges in time. Without growth in nuclear power, replacing fossil fuels with renewables simply decarbonizes the existing supply. It doesn’t deal with the increased demand coming from the developing world. One of the countries that have “solved climate change,” as the book’s subtitle has it, is Sweden, Qvist’s homeland. Much as France did before it, Sweden achieved this by expanding its electrical supply with nuclear power rather than fossil fuels. Its concern at the time, in the 1970s, wasn’t global warming but reliability: Further hydropower development was environmentally undesirable, and the oil crises of that decade made petroleum an unpredictable source. Between 1970 and 1990, Sweden built a dozen nuclear power plants on four sites, eight of which continue to operate today. They supply 40 percent of Sweden’s electricity, equal to its hydropower. Wind and biofuels supply the rest. As a result, electricity in Sweden is cheap, clean and reliable. Serendipitously, the authors point out, “Sweden became the most successful country in history at expanding low-carbon electricity generation and leading the way in addressing climate change.” Goldstein and Qvist contrast Sweden’s experience with Germany’s. That country decided to switch to renewables, mostly wind and solar, while eliminating nuclear power. By doubling renewables while cutting nuclear, “it just substituted one carbon-free source for another, and CO 2 emissions did not really decrease at all.” Today, 40 percent of Germany’s energy comes from dirty brown coal; six of Europe’s 10 most polluting power plants are German. After this initial view of two contrasting European programs, “A Bright Future” is largely devoted to debunking the many attacks nuclear power has weathered over the years. “The antinuclear movement has progressed through reasons to oppose nuclear power,” the authors write, “one after another.” It was too dangerous. Then it would lead to weapons proliferation. Then it was uneconomical, an argument still made, one the authors debunk when it comes to countries like Sweden and South Korea that haven’t experienced the strangulating effect of heavy government regulation and antinuclear litigation. Then it was unnecessary because it was argued that renewables could do the job. “But in every case where nuclear power was shut down, renewables have not filled the gap and CO 2 emissions have  gone up, whereas in places such as Ontario that expanded nuclear power, emissions went down.” A final claim, that nuclear power is politically infeasible, “is just a self-fulfilling prophecy, and we should not be so quick to write off the most practical solution for humanity’s most serious problem. … Politics have a way of catching up with necessity.” I happen to be in sympathy with these authors’ view that nuclear power must be a major part of the worldwide campaign to limit and reverse global warming. Their discussion omits an important historical component, however, one that has subverted logical argument. Historically, the antinuclear movement didn’t emerge from environmental concerns, which is why arguments for nuclear’s environmental advantages often fall on deaf ears. The movement originated out of a panic among European and American intellectuals in the 1950s and ’60s about overpopulation, expressed most luridly in such popular books as the entomologist Paul Ehrlich’s 1969 “The Population Bomb.” They believed more power plants would exacerbate human density and urban growth. But nuclear power champions like Alvin Weinberg, the longtime director of America’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, countered that nuclear could supply energy enough to forestall the social collapse the neo-Malthusians feared. In the end, the green revolution and the demographic transition that followed third-world economic development met food needs and limited population growth, now predicted to level off at 10 billion by 2100. But by then nuclear power was anathema to the Democratic Party and American and European Greens, a tragic misalignment of liberal values. The tide may be turning. Politics may catch up with necessity. But the “Green New Deal” recently championed in Congress includes even existing nuclear power production only grudgingly, and promotes the notion that “A Bright Future” disputes — that 100 percent renewables can save the day. Nuclear has stalled in America and in Western Europe, largely for political reasons, partly because of the boom in fracked natural gas. (Natural gas releases fully half as much CO 2 as coal. But except for the manufacture of its construction materials and fuel, nuclear releases none.)  Momentum has shifted to China and Russia, which are building advanced reactors for domestic use as well as for sale in Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Both, however, are increasing nuclear power production at home in order to sell their fossil fuels abroad, with little net gain against global warming. Whether all these oppositions will converge in time to spare us from global disaster remains to be seen. Their eyes on Sweden, Goldstein and Qvist are hopeful. I would like to be, but Cesare Marchetti’s evidence of the inertia inherent in energy transitions haunts me. As a harbinger of what’s coming if we don’t hurry, the Iranian city of Bandar Mahshahr in August 2015 suffered a heat index — combining temperature and humidity — of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. That’s the proper internal temperature of a cooked chicken.",2019-02-05T12:00:07.000+01:00,NYTIMES,bookreview-books-book-review

To the Editor: Re “ To Save the Planet, Go Nuclear ,” by Senators Lamar Alexander and Sheldon Whitehouse (Op-Ed, Dec. 22): The writers appear to have forgotten both the renewable revolution and the dangers of nuclear power. Today solar and wind power are lower in cost than even the existing nuclear plants, much less the runaway cost of new nuclear reactors. They also ignore the danger of nuclear power despite the very real risk of a huge release of deadly radiation from Fukushima-type accidents and the highly radioactive waste that they generate, for which there is no safe resting place after a 50-year search. The real path “to save the planet” is the agreement we’ve reached in California with Pacific Gas and Electric to replace the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant with a portfolio of efficiency and renewable energy. The utility itself agreed that renewables are cheaper than continuing to run that old nuclear plant. S. DAVID FREEMAN and DAMON MOGLEN Washington The writers are senior advisers to Friends of the Earth. Mr. Freeman is former chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority. To the Editor: As a physicist I absolutely agree that nuclear power is essential for mitigating global warming, as I explain in a video of a talk I gave. The risks of nuclear power are far exceeded by the actuality of fatalities from political instability due to global warming. We are at almost half a million deaths and counting in Syria alone. The civil war there was precipitated in large part by the worsening (due to global warming) of a drought that began in 1998. Millions of failed farmers migrated to the cities, leading to social unrest and civil war. The refugee crisis has also induced political instability in Europe and America. The intermittence of wind and solar and the lack of cost-effective energy storage preclude achieving the necessary reductions in carbon dioxide with “renewables.” The only carbon-free source of continuous power is nuclear. Modern reactors are far safer than those in Chernobyl or Fukushima. Neither of these designs would have met current Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards. We should be replacing our old reactors with safer new ones and expanding the total number. MICHAEL MALLARY Sterling, Mass. To the Editor: The senators are right, we should level the playing field. Let’s start by repealing the most excessive energy subsidy of all: the one provided by the Price-Anderson Act. Its curtailment would require that nuclear energy companies assume full responsibility for the cost of any damage beyond that covered by their liability insurance in the event of an accident. If advanced reactor designs do, indeed, reduce the threat of a meltdown, then perpetuation of this corporate welfare program should no longer be necessary. CARL BOUTON Breedsville, Mich. To the Editor: To suggest that this energy source that’s polluted half the globe is the answer to climate problems flies in the face of decades of evidence. Apart from disasters such as Chernobyl and Fukushima, nuclear reactors give off radioactive emissions from day-to-day operations and the waste they produce. A large-scale study by a German government-appointed committee turned up increased rates of childhood leukemia in the vicinity of all 16 nuclear power plants in Germany, findings that corroborated dozens of earlier studies once claimed to be “fringe.” Nuclear waste does not dilute and disappear, as industry would have us believe, but is blown by the winds, carried by the tides, seeps into earth and groundwater, and makes its way into the food chain and us, adding to the sum total of cancers and birth defects throughout the world. For good reasons, the industry crumbled under its costs, inefficiencies and dangers at the end of the last century; let it rest. GAYLE GREENE El Cerrito, Calif. The writer is the author of “The Woman Who Knew Too Much: Alice Stewart and the Secrets of Radiation,” a biography of the pioneering radiation epidemiologist. To the Editor: Senators Lamar Alexander and Sheldon Whitehouse make an excellent case for nuclear power. The United States was on the road to the development of safe, modular reactors in the 1960s that used the abundant element thorium. This design has two major safety features. One is that it operates at ordinary atmospheric pressure and does not require pressure vessels that could potentially explode. The other major safety feature is that if the reactor overheats, which has been the major cause of nuclear power plant accidents, the liquid salt thorium reactor simply stops working and automatically cools. This brilliant design was rejected by the United States government at the time because thorium reactors did not produce plutonium, needed for nuclear weapons, as was accomplished in uranium-based reactors. Uranium-based reactor designs thus became entrenched in the United States, as well as in other nuclear weapons states. Society has been living with that legacy ever since. While considerable research and development will be needed to produce reliable thorium reactors for public use, success can be achieved. The goal of ameliorating global warming should make this achievement the centerpiece for energy policy in the industrial world. EDWARD A. FRIEDMAN Hoboken, N.J. The writer is emeritus professor of technology management at Stevens Institute of Technology. To the Editor: The senators make great points. But, climate aside, one of the biggest benefits of nuclear power is that it creates thousands of construction jobs in the short term and hundreds of high-paying technical jobs throughout the operating life of a plant. For each 1,000 megawatts of installed capacity, nuclear creates approximately 5,000 jobs during construction, compared with only 1,000 jobs each for natural gas and wind. During operation, a nuclear plant produces approximately 500 jobs, compared with only 60 and 90 jobs for natural gas and wind, respectively. Nuclear energy presents a fantastic opportunity for President-elect Donald Trump to take a leadership role in creating high-quality, lasting jobs without sacrificing any of the progress we’ve made on reducing emissions. TYSON SMITH Mill Valley, Calif. The writer is a lawyer with clients in the nuclear energy industry. To the Editor: Should I laugh or cry? Lamar Alexander and Sheldon Whitehouse make what might be a compelling argument for increasing our use of nuclear energy in normal times. But these are not normal times.

The government’s business secretary, John Hutton, told lawmakers in Parliament that nuclear power “should have a role to play in this country’s future energy mix alongside other low-carbon sources.” Nuclear energy was a “tried and tested, safe and secure” source of power, Mr. Hutton said. He said private industry would pay for the reactors, and he invited companies to offer plans to build and operate the plants. Mr. Hutton placed no limit on the amount of electricity Britain would be able to generate from nuclear plants but said companies would be required to put aside money for decommissioning plants and pay a share of the cost of managing nuclear waste. Critics warned that hefty fees for waste management could still be passed on to consumers. Shares of British Energy, the company that operates 8 of the 10 British nuclear plants, rose on anticipation that the company would form alliances with other utilities. Areva, a French company that designs reactors, said that Britain was now a priority market. “Our ambition is to build at least four and probably six reactors in the U.K.,” Luc Oursel, the president of the reactors and services business of Areva, said. Among other companies ready to participate are the German utility E.On and Électricité de France, said Colette Lewiner, who monitors energy for the Capgemini consultant firm in Paris. The plans to replace aging nuclear plants signaled a new era of pragmatism at a time when concerns about promoting low-carbon technologies to curb climate change and energy security have become paramount. Rising prices for oil and gas have also made nuclear power more attractive. Luis Echávarri, director general of the Nuclear Energy Agency, an organization in Paris that advises industrialized countries on nuclear power, said the British decision could have ramifications across Europe  in particular in Germany  where opposition to nuclear power has been associated with left-leaning politics. In Germany, a government of Social Democrats and Greens agreed in 2000 to the phase-out of its reactors by 2021 because of the perceived safety risks. About a third of Germany’s electricity is nuclear. While some members of the conservative-led government under Chancellor Angela Merkel maintain a pro-nuclear stance, they have been stymied by having the Social Democrats as their coalition partner. Nuclear reactors supply nearly a fifth of electricity in Britain but the plants are aging, and the government would have no choice but to close them over the next decades and lay the groundwork for new investments if it aimed to keep nuclear a part of its energy supply.",2008-01-11T07:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-world-business

Richard Rhodes, the author of ''The Making of the Atom Bomb,'' brings in scientists and engineers to make a provocative case that nuclear energy, now being abandoned by the United States, is safer, cleaner and more efficient than the coal, oil and natural gas on which the nation continues to rely. If that goes against what you have read or heard, ''Nuclear Reaction'' blames fear-mongering by environmentalists (Ralph Nader to the fore), Hollywood studios (there's a clip from ''The China Syndrome'') and television news deliverers (yes, even Walter Cronkite). The nation's fears, rooted in memories of atom bombs, were heightened by the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island power plant, when errors led to a partial meltdown of a reactor. But Dr. John Moulder, a radiation biologist relied on by Mr. Rhodes, reminds us that there were no injuries or deaths and the amount of radiation emitted was much less than people in the area receive regularly from nature. The experts called on tonight agree that nothing approaching the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl in Ukraine could happen at America's reactors, which are more safely built. And even at Chernobyl, where the explosion and fire killed 31 people almost immediately, Mr. Rhodes calls the death toll ''surprisingly low.'' While noting that some children developed thyroid disease, he says that so far leukemia and adult cancers have not measurably increased. Specialists in risk analysis blame popular culture, with its nightmarish images of nuclear destruction, for the public's misapprehension that nuclear power is more harmful than, say, coal. Mr. Rhodes finds a very different attitude in France, which obtains 75 percent of its electricity from nuclear power. Some of the nuclear-friendliness is attributable to France's lack of other energy resources, which leaves the country little choice. But public education seems to be playing a part, too. Observing the high cost of nuclear power and the continuing headache of what to do with long-lived nuclear waste, the program suggests that a rational approach to these problems is obstructed by the prevailing anxiety over anything connected with the word nuclear. Mr. Rhodes says, ''We haven't needed nuclear power in America, so we enjoy the luxury of investing it with our nuclear fears.'' Explosive reactions to ''Nuclear Reaction'' are to be expected from the anti-nuclear cadres. Fine. Let's hope they will make their case with scientific evidence, as Mr. Rhodes does tonight, rather than with the toxic imagery that has contaminated the debate.

The deal was the commercial highlight of President Xi Jinping’s pageant-filled, four-day state visit to Britain, which is eager to get more Chinese investment and to export more British products to China. In a short news conference after signing the deal, the British prime minister, David Cameron, called the agreement historic and said it would produce thousands of British jobs. “The stronger the relationship between our countries, the more we’ll be able to have a serious dialogue” on areas of disagreement, like human rights, Mr. Cameron said. He said the two countries had signed agreements worth nearly 40 billion pounds, or about $62 billion. Mr. Xi also hailed the nuclear deal. He said that China respected the rule of law and “attaches great importance to human rights,” but on “a path suited to China’s conditions.” Critics have raised security concerns about Chinese involvement in Britain’s nuclear power network — particularly the potential for Chinese theft of industrial secrets from Britain and from Électricité de France, the French company that is one of Europe’s major nuclear contractors. The company, known as EDF, holds the contract to build Britain’s first new nuclear power plant in years. Modern nuclear plants and the electric utility grid make extensive use of computer networks. The ability of hackers to penetrate even well-protected data systems, analysts say, has increased the overall vulnerability of the nuclear industry, which has in the past largely relied on physical barriers for protection. “China would gain access to information that would give it more insight into the vulnerabilities in the U.K.’s critical infrastructure,” said Caroline Baylon, a specialist on online security at Chatham House, a research institute in London. “As much as possible, your critical infrastructure should be national,” Ms. Baylon said. A recent Chatham House report described the various ways that hackers might be able to worm their way into the operating system of a nuclear plant — and potentially cause widespread power outages. But British officials said that such concerns were highly exaggerated, that the Chinese would hold only a minority stake and that Britain would continue to tightly regulate the nuclear industry. Initially, the Chinese companies will be minority investors and suppliers to EDF. But the deal announced on Wednesday opens the way for China to invest in future British nuclear projects and possibly to play a larger role in building the plants, giving more credibility to the Chinese nuclear industry and perhaps helping it to sell more nuclear plants abroad. The deal involves plans for a nuclear power station called Hinkley Point C and would result in the first nuclear plant begun in Western Europe since the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan made many countries rethink their nuclear energy strategies. France has long been a global leader in nuclear power, but it has stumbled lately in trying to introduce a new generation of technology — the type of reactors that will be used in Britain. Hinkley Point C, on a headland overlooking the Bristol Channel in southwestern England, is already years behind schedule and well over its original cost estimates. The cost is now projected at £18 billion, and the plant is not expected to open before 2025. The site already has an operating nuclear power plant and two older reactors that are being decommissioned. A state-controlled Chinese company, China General Nuclear Power Corporation, has agreed to invest £6 billion and take a 33.5 percent stake in the Hinkley Point project. China General expects to help EDF build two more reactors planned for Sizewell, in eastern England. The French company has agreed to help China General win a license to build a Chinese-designed nuclear reactor in Britain at a site in Bradwell, east of London, which would be a first for China. Although Britain receives nearly 20 percent of its electricity from its fleet of aging nuclear reactors, the country ceded much of its commercial nuclear industry to France in 2009. That is when EDF bought nearly all of Britain’s reactors. As in many nations, Britain’s electric utilities have neither the financial strength nor the inclination to take the risks involved in building new nuclear power stations. Centrica, a British utility that is a minority partner with EDF on the existing nuclear plants, walked away from a 20 percent stake in the new one, citing delays and rising costs. Ewan Lawson, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London research organization, said he was not concerned about the early stages of Chinese involvement in Britain’s nuclear program. “Essentially, they are funding a French” project, he said. “In a perfect world, you would have all your infrastructure engineered by your own nationals, over whom you have some degree of surveillance,” Mr. Lawson said. “That is not the world the U.K. lives in.” Having not built a new power station since 1995, Britain has little choice but to look to outside suppliers and financing. The French industry’s reputation has been damaged by major delays and cost overruns at projects at Olkiluoto in Finland and Flamanville in France. The French government is revamping the industry, giving EDF a more dominant role over Areva, the company that has played a major role in designing and constructing the reactors that are experiencing problems. Areva has been forced to cut thousands of jobs. As Britain’s North Sea oil reserves are gradually drawn down, the government sees nuclear power as an important way to diversify the country’s energy supply in a carbon-free way that will also help meet its long-term climate goals. The Hinkley Point C plant, though not expected to go into operation before 2025, is intended to meet around 7 percent of Britain’s current electricity needs and run relatively cheaply for at least 60 years. For the Chinese nuclear industry, the chance to invest in Britain represents a major opportunity. China has by far the most ambitious nuclear building program in the world with 68 commercial reactors under construction or in the planning stages, according to the World Nuclear Association, an industry group. China has received help from the French and the big Japanese company Toshiba but has gradually developed its own local designs and built up a large chain of domestic suppliers. Industry executives say this building boom means that Chinese nuclear contractors have gained considerable knowledge and experience, which they hope to apply outside China. “They have a very clear strategy to build their nuclear capacity and capability,” said Colin Elcoate, vice president for business development at SPX Flow, a North Carolina company that supplies pumps and other equipment to Chinese and other nuclear power companies. Mr. Elcoate says the Chinese ultimately want to move into nuclear exports. But the Chinese nuclear contractors have had little international success so far, with one nuclear station under construction in Pakistan and a few others planned in countries like Argentina and Romania. Analysts say that building a plant in Britain, which has one of the more rigorous approval processes, would give China the credibility it needs. If Chinese technology is “licensed in the U.K., it is licensable anywhere,” said Glenn George, a Washington-based consultant on nuclear issues at NERA Economic Consulting. Mr. George and other analysts think that the market in the coming decades will be substantial. Although Germany plans to phase out nuclear power, at least some other European countries — including the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain — intend to keep atomic power. And there is substantial interest in nuclear power among emerging-market countries like Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia that seek a cleaner alternative to coal and other fossil fuels. Arab countries like Saudi Arabia, which is short of gas to fire its power plants, and Abu Dhabi, which is already building nuclear stations, could also become major markets. Mr. Lawson, of the Royal United Services Institute, said that if Chinese contractors eventually designed and built plants, he would expect the British government to take a similar approach to China’s nuclear companies as it does in its treatment of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker. The United States government has not allowed Huawei to supply equipment to the American telecommunications network because of security concerns, but the company has been accepted as a supplier to British networks. To guard against espionage, the British government has set up a center near Oxford, England, where security experts test Huawei’s gear.",2015-10-21T18:51:44.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-international-business

STAND among the pumpkins and purple mums in the gravel parking lot of Anna's Garden and Gift Center and you can glimpse beyond the trees a ghost that haunts the nuclear power industry. There hulk the twin cooling towers of Three Mile Island Unit 2, the nuclear reactor that had a partial meltdown in 1979. That event, paired with the Chernobyl explosion in Ukraine in 1986, halted the growth of the American nuclear power industry for a generation. No new plant has been ordered in the United States since the Three Mile Island accident. But existing plants have kept operating: the United States has 104 reactors, which make a fifth of its power. Lately, the nuclear-power sector has been enjoying something of a revival, because of its operating-cost advantages over other forms of electricity production. That may prompt investors to bet on its resurgence by buying shares in nuclear power plant operators, equipment makers or fuel producers. The economic appeal of nuclear power has risen as prices for natural gas and coal -- fuels for the bulk of America's electricity -- have climbed. The price of natural gas, especially, has soared. In October, it touched $14 per million British thermal units. That was nearly double the price from October of last year. ''There's a big advantage for operating a nuclear plant when gas prices are in the $5 range, much less where they are today,'' said John C. Kohli, portfolio manager at the Franklin Utilities fund. Many people, of course, still worry about inadvertent releases of radiation and about the long-term storage of radioactive waste. But in some circles, those fears are beginning to be overtaken by an appreciation of nuclear power's competitive advantages. As concern about global warming has become mainstream, some investors are reminded that nuclear power produces no greenhouse gases. And while nuclear power plants could be vulnerable to a terrorist attack, war and recent hurricanes have underscored the fragility of fossil-fuel supplies. Federal lawmakers have given nuclear power a nudge, too, with a raft of subsidies in the Energy Policy Act this year. ''The incentives in there were a bold statement that nuclear is going to be an important part of the U.S. electricity supply in the future,'' said Timothy P. O'Brien, manager of the Evergreen Utility and Telecommunications fund. Still, investors should understand that betting on nuclear power entails risks beyond the stock market's usual shimmies and shakes. Domestic plants have operated without a major accident since Three Mile Island, but another big stumble, in the United States or abroad, could hobble the industry. And many long-term issues remain, including the questions about waste storage and the proliferation of nuclear technology, said Ernest J. Moniz, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The construction of a long-promised waste repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, has been delayed by years of legal arm-wrestling. If investors choose to go nuclear, perhaps the most conservative approach is to buy shares of utilities with big nuclear operations -- utilities like Exelon, Entergy, Dominion Resources and the FPL Group, said Mark C. Sadeghian, an analyst at Morningstar. Exelon, based in Chicago, has made a hefty wager on nuclear generation, he noted. It has 17 reactors at 10 sites. If it completes a pending acquisition of the Public Service Enterprise Group, based in Newark, it will have 20 reactors at 12 sites. Exelon's stock is up more than 15 percent this year. Among Exelon's plants is Three Mile Island Unit 1, a mirror image of its infamous sibling. Both occupy the same central Pennsylvania island, protected by glistening razor wire and guards toting assault rifles. Unit 1 generates about seven million megawatt-hours of power a year, while Unit 2 sits idle and entombed. Exelon does not own Unit 2, but monitors it for its owner, First-Energy of Akron, Ohio. ''Several years ago, when the industry started to deregulate, many companies decided to sell off their nuclear plants, and very few companies had the bright idea to buy them, though they were being sold by pennies on the dollar,'' said Judith A. Saryan, portfolio manager at the Eaton Vance Utilities fund. ''Exelon was one of the companies that had the good sense to buy.'' Operating a passel of plants helped Exelon to hone its nuclear expertise, Ms. Saryan said. ''Now its nuclear fleet runs at 95 percent capacity.'' Entergy, with 10 reactors, is the second-biggest nuclear operator, after Exelon. Entergy's hometown utility, Entergy New Orleans, had to file for bankruptcy-court protection after Hurricane Katrina, but that division accounts for less than 5 percent of the parent's earnings, said Shelby G. Tucker, a principal at Banc of America Securities. ''About a third of their earnings comes from their large nuclear fleet in the Northeast,'' he added. Those plants could soon contribute even more to profits. Entergy sells its power at below-market prices because of risk-hedging contracts, he said. As the hedges expire, ''they'll be able to recontract at higher prices.'' Eight power companies, including Exelon and Entergy, are trying to prepare the way for the eventual licensing of a new nuclear plant. Their coalition, called NuStart Energy, aims to test a streamlined federal licensing process and to develop a design for a new reactor. Other countries, especially China and India, are likely to build more nuclear plants and to do so sooner. ''People are talking about China building 20 to 21 new reactors,'' said David M. Schanzer, utility analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. A company that may have a role in construction abroad is General Electric, which has designed and sold parts for plants for decades. But the nuclear business accounts for just a tincture of G.E.'s sales. Buying G.E. for its atomic expertise is like buying a bag of M&M's just to eat the green ones. A foreign company with a focus on nuclear power is British Energy, which produces about a fifth of Britain's electricity, said Charlie B. Gaffney, an analyst at Eaton Vance. British Energy owns eight nuclear plants and one coal-fired one. ''So they're basically a pure-play nuclear generator,'' he said. ''They've had some problems in the past, and they're in restructuring mode.'' If the company succeeds, its cheap power could yield healthy returns, he said. Only one domestic company qualifies as a pure-play nuclear investment: USEC, a former government agency that chemically modifies uranium for use as reactor fuel; it is based in Bethesda, Md. Since being privatized in 1998, its earnings and stock price have zigzagged. This fall, the company reorganized, cutting its staff by 6 percent, to about 2,700, and bringing in a new boss, John K. Welch, from General Dynamics. USEC's government legacy has hampered it by saddling it with outdated technology, Mr. Welch said. Its enrichment plant was designed in the 1950's and uses more electricity than competitors abroad. That is why the company is betting on a giant centrifuge costing $1.7 billion. It should use about 5 percent of the electricity required by the current method, Mr. Welch said, adding that ''we hope to have that up and running by 2011 or 2012.'' A competitor -- Louisiana Energy Services, yet another venture that includes Exelon and Entergy -- has announced plans to bring an enrichment plant in New Mexico online at about the same time. Ultimately, investors' best hope for nuclear power may be that it comes to be viewed as just another business, rather than the industrial offspring of a perilous technology. IN Londonderry, Anna M. and Daniel J. Angelo, owners of Anna's Garden and Gift Center, already seem to see the industry that way. They don't fret much about the past of Three Mile Island Unit 2. Sure, they tell tales about the huge nuclear plant -- about the iodine tablets, a radiation antidote, handed out at their children's school after Sept. 11, 2001, and about the way the warm-water discharge into the Susquehanna River draws fish and anglers in the winter. Otherwise, they accept the reactor, saying it brings well-paying jobs to their area. ''We joke about having glow-in-the dark plants,'' Ms. Angelo said. ''Other than that, people don't talk that much about it. You get so used to it.'' SUNDAY MONEY: INVESTING",2005-11-20T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,money-and-business-financial-desk

The uproar that followed rekindled environmental groups’ hopes of shutting down the aging plant. The proposed closing, albeit a long shot, has gained some support this year among Vermont politicians. The discussion is bringing into sharp relief a conflict between two objectives long held by environmental advocates: combating nuclear power and stopping global warming. Nuclear plants supply nearly 20 percent of the nation’s electricity, and they do so without emitting the carbon dioxide that is the principal cause of global warming. Vermont’s 36-year-old plant, which feeds into the regional power grid, represents a third of the state’s electrical generation. Antinuclear groups that are arguing for closing the plant hope to replace the lost electricity with renewable generation from wind turbines, solar power and the combustion of plant material. Additionally, they cite the potential for cutting electrical demand by making homes and business more efficient. Even so, some environmental advocates have reluctantly acknowledged that no combination of renewable power and improved efficiency can replace the plant, Vermont Yankee, at least in the near term. Instead, the state would probably have to tap the Northeastern grid  which derives more than half its energy from fossil fuels  for extra power. “We’ll likely have to go to the market, and that will mean an increase in Vermont’s electricity portfolio that comes from fossil fuels,” said Andrew Perchlik, director of Renewable Energy Vermont, a group that promotes clean power, speaking about the prospect of the plant’s closing. He faulted the state government and utilities for not focusing earlier on renewable energy, saying that if they had done so, “we wouldn’t be in this predicament.” The Vermont debate comes as interest in nuclear power is increasing across the country, driven by rising demand for power as well as emissions concerns. Like other plants nationwide, Vermont Yankee is seeking a 20-year extension of its operating license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the federal body that oversees the country’s reactor fleet. A decision, which could allow the plant to keep operating until 2032, is expected later this year. Several utilities, encouraged by the federal government, are considering building nuclear reactors for the first time in three decades. In Vermont, home to many people with a back-to-the-land viewpoint, surveys show that people want to move away from fuels like coal and oil that emit large amounts of carbon dioxide. They also support renewable energy. But the same surveys show less consensus on nuclear power. At energy workshops last year, nearly two-thirds of participants said Vermont utilities should cease buying power from the nuclear plant  unless fossil fuels and out-of-state nuclear power were the alternatives, in which case more than half would continue with Vermont Yankee. Not counting dams, another low-emission energy source that many environmental groups oppose, renewable power makes up 2.5 percent of the nation’s electricity generation. That figure is higher in Vermont, 6 percent, but renewables are still a long way from supplying the bulk of the state’s power. Starting from these slim figures, many advocacy groups dream of achieving a nuclear-free mix burnished by local renewables. State researchers estimate that as much as 48 percent of Vermont’s power could one day come from local renewables, including small hydropower projects. “When you look at all the scenarios for climate change, nuclear is not a must-do,” said James Moore, the clean-energy advocate for the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, a group that opposes the nuclear plant. But utilities in Vermont, like their counterparts elsewhere in the country, argue that environmental advocates are mistaken if they believe a low-emission future can be achieved without nuclear power. They note the intermittency of power sources like windmills and solar panels, and argue that the nation needs more, not fewer, big power plants that emit no carbon dioxide. “Vermont is in an enviable position right now,” said Steve Costello, a spokesman for the state’s largest utility, Central Vermont Public Service. “We have arguably the cleanest power in the country from an air-emissions standpoint, and we have the lowest rates in the Northeast.” His utility is willing to build more renewables, he said, but closing Vermont Yankee would make maintaining clean and cheap power “much more difficult.” Even as some Vermonters argue for more renewable power, proposals to build it have hit snags. Vermont has only one commercial wind farm, 11 turbines along a mountain ridge. They have less than 1 percent of the capacity of Vermont Yankee, a relatively small nuclear plant. Other proposed projects have been stalled by local opposition. One wind project would infringe on bear habitat. Another won approval from state regulators, but a local group filed a court appeal to block it. “Vermont is very protective of its environment regulation,” said Mr. Perchlik of Renewable Energy Vermont. “It’s not going to be done Texas-style, where you can get a permit in a month.” He nonetheless hopes that wind turbines can provide 20 percent of Vermont’s electricity by 2015. Besides tapping into the Northeastern grid, Vermont could import more power from Hydro Quebec, a giant dam system in Canada that already accounts for a third of Vermont’s electricity, but that would probably help push up prices. Solar power is also costly. Burning wood chips or other plant material is one option  Burlington already has such a plant  but a large one would face pollution and other problems. The best bet for reducing the state’s emissions may be energy efficiency, in which Vermont already excels. Since 2000, an outfit called Efficiency Vermont has coaxed homeowners and businesses to change their light bulbs and buy more efficient appliances, like refrigerators. The state believes it has already cut power demand slightly this way. Concerns about the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant, in the town of Vernon, focus on the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, a nationwide problem, and on local concerns about safety. Last August, Vermonters were shocked to see images of water gushing out of a huge pipe onto a heap of collapsed wooden beams. A portion of one of the plant’s two cooling towers had fallen in after decay weakened the wood. No radioactivity was released, but Entergy, the plant’s operator, labored to explain how it could have missed such an obvious problem. Rob Williams, an Entergy spokesman, said the cooling tower collapse, along with other recent incidents, “certainly impacted reliability, but the safety was not at all impacted.” Major repairs and improvements to both cooling towers have just been completed, he said, with crucial timbers replaced by fiberglass-reinforced plastic. The Vermont Legislature has already voted to tighten plant oversight, and next year it is likely to take a vote on shutting down the plant, though whether the state would actually have the power to close the plant is unclear. The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses and regulates all reactors, and some experts predict lawsuits if Vermont tries a shutdown.",2008-05-30T08:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day
3749595d-c259-4328-b201-ae5e097f8f23,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/13/world/asia/nuclear-power-emerges-as-election-issue-in-taiwan.html,Vote Holds Fate of Nuclear Power in Taiwan,"TAIPEI, Taiwan — When voters here choose a president and a new legislature on Saturday, their decisions will also determine whether Taiwan pulls the plug on a state-backed nuclear power industry that provides the country with a fifth of its electricity. Although the presidential race has mostly been about pocketbook concerns and, to a lesser extent, Taiwan’s relationship with China, the leading challenger has made the elimination of Taiwan’s reliance on nuclear energy a central plank of her campaign. Pollsters and analysts say that the challenger, Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party, has a good chance of unseating the incumbent, Ma Ying-jeou, whose party has long been a reliable backer of nuclear energy. In recent months, Ms. Tsai has vowed to retire the island’s six aging reactors and has said that she would seek to mothball a problem-plagued nuclear plant that has been under construction since the late 1990s. The plant, whose price tag has nearly doubled to $9.3 billion, was supposed to begin operating this year, but further delays appear likely. “After Fukushima, our society has realized that nuclear power is not only expensive but also unsafe,” Ms. Tsai said recently, referring to the nuclear disaster in Japan last March that contaminated a large area around the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The repercussions from Fukushima have been pronounced in Europe, where the governments of Germany, Switzerland and Belgium have promised to abandon nuclear power in the coming decades. However, countries across Asia continue to embrace it. China has 28 plants under construction, and India is building seven reactors and has plans for 20 more. And despite its proximity to Japan, South Korea, with 21 active nuclear reactors, is moving forward on 18 more. Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand are all actively seeking to join the nuclear-power club. But Taiwan — an island devoid of oil, gas and coal reserves — appears to be losing its appetite for the atom. Last spring thousands of protesters in Taipei demanded an end to the construction of the latest plant, the Lungmen nuclear project, or Nuke 4. Soon afterward, one of Taiwan’s richest tycoons joined the antinuclear chorus: Chang Yung-fa, chairman of the Evergreen Group, one of the world’s largest shippers. Opponents say that there are a number of active seismic faults across the island and that more than five million people in northern Taiwan live within an 18-mile radius of two nuclear plants. For the 23 million people living on an island the size of Maryland and Delaware combined, there would be few places to run in the event of a disaster. “Taiwan is simply ill suited for nuclear energy,” said Tsui Shu-hsin, secretary general of the Green Citizens’ Action Alliance, which has been waging a lonely battle against atomic power. Through the years Mr. Ma’s party successfully beat back efforts to kill the Lungmen project, but he has lately softened his stance. Adopting Ms. Tsai’s talk of a “nuclear-free homeland” at a news conference in November, Mr. Ma eased away from a government proposal to extend the life of the existing plants, which were built in the 1970s when Taiwan was led by the Kuomintang under martial law. He also insisted that Nuke 4 would become operational only if it met much stricter safety guidelines. Environmentalists have been heartened by such pronouncements. “Before, no one was interested in talking about the problems of nuclear power, but now it feels like history and politics are on our side,” said Gloria Hsu, a professor of atmospheric sciences at National Taiwan University and a former chairwoman of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union. Proponents of nuclear energy say all the talk of a nuclear-free Taiwan neglects one important detail: how to replace the power generated by the reactors. Taiwan produces about 1 percent of its energy supplies and relies on a mix of imports: oil from the Middle East, coal from China and Australia and natural gas from Indonesia and Malaysia. Ms. Tsai speaks of increased conservation and of shifting the Taiwanese economy away from power-hungry manufacturing. Part of her “2025 Nuclear-Free Homeland Initiative” also calls for the construction of gas-fired turbines and an expanded reliance on solar and wind power. But Wey Kwo-dong, an economics professor at National Taipei University, said none of those options could quickly replace the loss of nuclear power. “Taiwan has to import 98 percent of its energy needs, so I’m not sure where people expect to get their electricity from,” he said. “The issue has become so political, no one is considering the impact on Taiwan’s economy.”",2012-01-13T03:42:20.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The worker, Hisashi Ouchi, 35, was hurt on Sept. 30 in an accident at a nuclear fuel plant near Tokyo that also critically injured two other workers. Scores of nearby residents were exposed to radiation. ''He was a victim of a myth perpetrated by the national government and the nuclear power industry that nuclear energy is safe,'' said Tatsu ya Murakami, the mayor of Tokaimura, where the accident took place. Japan's nuclear power industry has been on the defensive since the accident, opening a rare chapter in this country's history in which citizens have effectively brought pressure to bear on the tacit coalition between government and business in a major industry. In a front-page commentary today, Asahi Shimbun, a leading newspaper, noted that the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979 had led to the end of the expansion of nuclear power in the United States. After the accident in Tokaimura, the paper said, the Japanese people ''are starting to feel genuine horror and concern about nuclear power generation, perhaps for the first time in their lives.'' Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi offered his condolences to Mr. Ouchi's family and said, ''The government has been working so that such an accident will never be repeated.'' Far more than in most countries, large numbers of people in Japan have associated all things nuclear with death and destruction, a legacy of the atomic bombings of their country by the United States in 1945. The nuclear power industry, which supplies more than 30 percent of Japan's electricity, was able to thrive only after unstinting efforts to cultivate an image of extraordinary safety. For many, the Tokaimura accident, caused by procedural lapses, not only shattered the safety myth, but also, because Mr. Ouchi died after months of suffering, brought back memories of the bombings. Recent pressure by civic groups and a strong shift in public opinion have already forced several of the largest nuclear power plants to cancel or postpone plans to upgrade their operations. A particular target has been the planned use of a hybrid fuel containing uranium and plutonium by so-called light-water plants that were originally designed to use uranium only. Nuclear energy experts have long warned that the mixed fuel increases the risk of rupture inside the cores of power plants. Moreover, they say, in case of a catastrophic accident, plutonium and its byproducts are far more lethal than uranium. What few foresaw, though, was the kind of blunder that occurred at Tokaimura, where poorly trained workers were following crude shortcuts, mixing nuclear fuels by hand with steel buckets, and seven times the normal amount of fuel was poured into a container, resulting in a nuclear chain reaction that took nearly a day to halt. In the space of a few minutes, Mr. Ouchi, the worst-injured worker, was exposed to 400 times the maximum amount of radiation a nuclear plant worker is allowed to received in an entire year. Perhaps in part because of dread of the backlash against nuclear power, the government went to extraordinary lengths to save Mr. Ouchi, who had had not regained consciousness since mid-October. According to the doctors involved in his care, 10 liters of blood were transfused into his body daily in recent weeks. In late November he was resuscitated after his heart failed. Since then, doctors said, his skin, which suffered severe peeling after the accident and never healed, was oozing more and more fluid. Doctors said that despite the administration of huge amounts of painkilling drugs, and even in his unconscious state, the patient winced and showed other signs of agony when receiving treatment.",1999-12-23T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,world

That would provide benefits for places like her home state, which has produced coal and relied on it as fuel for power generators. “Ultimately, you get to a point where you need something that’s not weather dependent, something like nuclear to make the grid reliable,” said John Kotek, who ran the Office of Nuclear Energy during the Obama administration and is now vice president for policy at the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade association. “There are other technologies that are candidates to play that role, but if you look at what is available today across the widest scale, that’s nuclear energy.” The rising costs of other sources of power have made nuclear energy more competitive around the world, including in the United States, which has the largest fleet of nuclear plants of any country. They produce about 20 percent of the nation’s electricity and 50 percent of the clean energy. The United States maintains 92 reactors, though a dozen have closed over the last decade — including, a month ago, the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station in Michigan, about 55 miles southwest of Grand Rapids. The owner, Entergy, decided to shut the plant after a power-purchase agreement with a utility expired. Entergy said it could not find buyers for the plant, and decommissioning has gone too far to bring it back online, even with the money from the federal government. Diablo Canyon is next on the decommissioning list, but Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed extending its life. The plant, on California’s central coast, supplies almost 10 percent of the state’s electricity. Pacific Gas & Electric, which owns the plant, announced in 2016 that it planned to close it when its licenses expired, saying it would focus more on solar and wind power as renewable energy sources.",2022-07-05T09:00:13.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

The problems were so acute that Federal regulators listed it as one of the nation's three worst-run nuclear plants. Now, three months after the plant resumed generating power, potentially dangerous management problems persist, according to Federal nuclear officials and the nuclear industry's own internal quality-control group, the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations. Although no incidents at the restarted reactor have directly threatened public safety, operators several times this summer ran the plant in ways that could increase the risk of an accident, Federal inspectors say. The most significant problem at the plant, on the east bank of the Hudson about 35 miles north of Manhattan, occurred in early July. The reactor was run for two days with its cooling system at a pressure lower than the permitted range, according to inspectors for the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which licenses nuclear plants. Federal inspectors said the problem lay not with the low-pressure operation -- which was most likely not dangerous -- but with the decision to take the plant into essentially uncharted waters by operating it in a way that had not been carefully studied. With Indian Point 3 and a neighboring plant, Indian Point 2, surrounded by more people than any other nuclear site in the country, there is no room for such errors, said Robert D. Pollard, a nuclear engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group that monitors nuclear plant performance. ""Ten percent of the population of the United States lives within 60 miles of Indian Point,"" Mr. Pollard said. When any complex system is run under conditions that have not been thoroughly analyzed, a cascade of unforeseen errors could result in catastrophe, he said. On Monday, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that conditions at the plant had improved enough since the summer that it decided not to impose a possible $50,000 fine on the New York Power Authority, Indian Point 3's owner, for the low-pressure incident. But the agency's regional administrator, Thomas T. Martin, said in a letter to the Power Authority, the nuclear agency remained ""concerned with the poor performance by your managers and staff prior to, during and in immediate response to the event."" Indian Point 2 is owned by Consolidated Edison. The Nuclear Regulatory Agency and the Power Authority planned to hold a briefing to update the public on plant conditions on Wednesday. Criticism of the New York Power Authority has also come from within the normally insular nuclear industry itself. William J. Cahill Jr., the chief nuclear officer for the Power Authority, acknowledged in an interview that the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, which acts as something of a nuclear ombudsman, providing confidential assessments of plants, sharply criticized lapses at the plant and training methods. But he emphasized that the industry group had even higher standards than the Federal Government. The most recent shutdown at Indian Point 3 lasted from February 1993 until July 19. The Power Authority replaced 19 of the plant's 27 top managers and claimed to have instituted among its 900 employees a new ""nuclear religion,"" ordering workers and supervisors to pay more attention to recommended procedure and to be more vigilant about identifying problems. But in an inspection report covering July and early August, Federal engineers noted a continued pattern at the plant of using a strict menu of operating procedures only as loose guidelines, with operators straying occasionally and then not promptly reporting these so-called ""deviation events."" The most serious incident occurred when workers lowered the pressure in the cooling system that sends water through the hot reactor in an effort to close a jammed valve, the report said. Mr. Cahill said the industry group was particularly critical of this decision. The normal procedure, he said, would be to stop the nuclear reaction in the core of the plant first, then try to close the valve. Conditions seem to be on the upswing at the plant, said Curtis J. Cowgill 3d, the director of nuclear plant inspections for the New York region at N.R.C. In its most recent inspection report, covering Aug. 8 to Sept. 18, the N.R.C. noted only one minor violation, he said. ""When a plant like this starts up, you don't expect everything to go perfectly,"" Mr. Cowgill said. ""We believe they're making a good faith effort but still need improvement.""",1995-10-18T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Underscoring the source of its economic inspiration, the name of the enterprise is likely to be Atomprom, Sergei V. Kiriyenko, the director of the Atomic Energy Agency, said Wednesday in remarks on the agency's Web site. Speaking at a conference on nuclear energy, he said the new company, unlike Gazprom, would be wholly state-owned. At the same time, he said, it is intended to be a more efficient and powerful corporation able to compete against the international giants in the nuclear power industry, like Toshiba, General Electric, Hitashi and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. ''A renaissance of nuclear energy is beginning in the world,'' he said, ''and we face the task of breaking into it.'' President Vladimir V. Putin, who has overseen the steady strengthening of state control over industries deemed to be of strategic importance, has called for a vast expansion of nuclear power in Russia, with as many as 40 new reactors. Earlier this year he spoke of plans ''to consolidate Russia's position on the world markets.'' Mr. Putin said earlier this month that the plans for restructuring the agency were close to completion. They are not finished yet, but Mr. Kiriyenko, who took over the agency last year, suggested that the plans had progressed and involved unifying dozens of disparate state agencies, some with overlapping or competing functions. ''In order to compete,'' he said, Russia needs ''a single powerful company capable of competing with major transnational corporations.'' An agency spokesman, Sergei G. Novikov, said in a telephone interview that a final proposal would be completed soon and that the agency hoped to spin off the new enterprise by the last quarter of the year. He said the restructuring required significant changes in legislation that had not yet been adopted by the Parliament. He said the new enterprise would incorporate operations now involved in extraction, enrichment and disposal of nuclear fuel, the construction of reactors, as well as their operation and maintenance, and the transmission of the power. The agency's Web site lists 96 separate enterprises, from power plants to a hotel. The exact list of those involved in the overhaul, he said, has not yet been compiled. Russia now has 10 civilian nuclear power plants. Military nuclear programs would not be included in the new structure. Mr. Novikov said that creating a single commercial enterprise would improve the chances of receiving investments and loans needed to pay for the country's ambitious program to expand nuclear power generation.",2006-06-29T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business
fdee2963-c26c-4da1-9aee-56b518b29a99,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/28/business/28nuke.html,"In Vermont, a Debate Swirls Around an Aging Nuclear Plant","BRATTLEBORO, Vt.  After part of a cooling tower collapsed last August at Vermont’s only nuclear power plant, the company that runs it blamed rotting wooden timbers that it had failed to inspect properly. The uproar that followed rekindled environmental groups’ hopes of shutting down the aging plant. The proposed closing, albeit a long shot, has gained some support this year among Vermont politicians. The discussion here is bringing into sharp relief a conflict between two objectives long held by environmental advocates: combating nuclear power and stopping global warming. Nuclear plants supply nearly 20 percent of the nation’s electricity, and they do so without emitting the carbon dioxide that is the principal cause of global warming. Vermont’s 36-year-old plant, which feeds into the regional power grid, represents a third of the state’s electrical generation. Antinuclear groups who are arguing for closing the plant hope to replace the lost electricity with renewable generation from wind turbines, solar power and the combustion of plant material. Additionally, they cite the potential for cutting electrical demand by making homes and business more efficient. Even so, some environmental advocates have reluctantly acknowledged that no combination of renewable power and improved efficiency can replace the plant, Vermont Yankee, at least in the near term. Instead, the state would probably have to tap the Northeastern grid  which derives more than half its energy from fossil fuels  for extra power. “We’ll likely have to go to the market, and that will mean an increase in Vermont’s electricity portfolio that comes from fossil fuels,” said Andrew Perchlik, director of Renewable Energy Vermont, a group that promotes clean power, speaking about the prospect of the plant’s closing. He faulted the state government and utilities for not focusing earlier on renewable energy, saying if they had done so, “we wouldn’t be in this predicament.” The Vermont debate comes as interest in nuclear power is increasing across the country, driven by rising demand for power as well as emissions concerns. Like other plants nationwide, Vermont Yankee is seeking a 20-year extension of its operating license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the federal body that oversees the country’s reactor fleet. A decision, which could allow the plant to keep operating until 2032, is expected later this year. Several utilities, encouraged by the federal government, are considering building nuclear reactors for the first time in three decades. In Vermont, home to many people with a back-to-the-land viewpoint, surveys show that people want to move away from fuels like coal and oil that emit large amounts of carbon dioxide. They also support renewable energy. But the same surveys show less consensus on nuclear power. At energy workshops last year, nearly two-thirds of participants said Vermont utilities should cease buying power from the nuclear plant  unless fossil fuels and out-of-state nuclear power were the alternatives, in which case more than half would continue with Vermont Yankee. Not counting dams, another low-emission energy source that many environmental groups oppose, renewable power makes up 2.5 percent of the nation’s electricity generation. That figure is higher in Vermont, 6 percent, but renewables are still a long way from supplying the bulk of the state’s power. Starting from these slim figures, many advocacy groups dream of achieving a nuclear-free mix burnished by local renewables. State researchers estimate that as much as 48 percent of Vermont’s power could one day come from local renewables, including small hydropower projects. “When you look at all the scenarios for climate change, nuclear is not a must-do,” said James Moore, the clean-energy advocate for the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, a group that opposes the nuclear plant. But utilities in Vermont, like their counterparts elsewhere in the country, argue that environmental advocates are mistaken if they believe a low-emission future can be achieved without nuclear power. They note the intermittency of power sources like windmills and solar panels, and argue that the nation needs more, not fewer, big power plants that emit no carbon dioxide. “Vermont is in an enviable position right now,” said Steve Costello, a spokesman for the state’s largest utility, Central Vermont Public Service. “We have arguably the cleanest power in the country from an air-emissions standpoint, and we have the lowest rates in the Northeast.” His utility is willing to build more renewables, he said, but closing Vermont Yankee would make maintaining clean and cheap power “much more difficult.” Even as some Vermonters argue for more renewable power, proposals to build it have hit snags. Vermont has only one commercial wind farm, 11 turbines along a mountain ridge. They have less than 1 percent of the capacity of Vermont Yankee, a relatively small nuclear plant. Other proposed projects have been stalled by local opposition. One wind project would infringe on bear habitat. Another won approval from state regulators, but a local group filed a court appeal to block it. “Vermont is very protective of its environment regulation,” said Mr. Perchlik of Renewable Energy Vermont. “It’s not going to be done Texas-style, where you can get a permit in a month.” He nonetheless hopes that wind turbines can provide 20 percent of Vermont’s electricity by 2015. Besides tapping into the Northeastern grid, Vermont could import more power from Hydro Quebec, a giant dam system in Canada that already accounts for a third of Vermont’s electricity, but that would probably help push up prices. Solar power is also costly. Burning wood chips or other plant material is one option  Burlington already has such a plant  but a large one would face pollution and other problems. The best bet for reducing the state’s emissions may be energy efficiency, in which Vermont already excels. Since 2000, an outfit called Efficiency Vermont has coaxed homeowners and businesses to change their light bulbs and buy more efficient appliances, like refrigerators. The state believes it has already cut power demand slightly this way. Concerns about the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant, in the town of Vernon, focus on the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, a nationwide problem, and on local concerns about safety. Last August, Vermonters were shocked to see images of water gushing out of a huge pipe onto a heap of collapsed wooden beams. A portion of one of the plant’s two cooling towers had fallen in after decay weakened the wood. No radioactivity was released, but Entergy, the plant’s operator, labored to explain how it could have missed such an obvious problem. Rob Williams, an Entergy spokesman, said the cooling tower, along with other recent incidents, “certainly impacted reliability, but the safety was not at all impacted.” Major repairs and improvements to both cooling towers have just been completed, he said, with crucial timbers replaced by fiberglass-reinforced plastic. The Vermont legislature has already voted to tighten plant oversight, and next year it is likely to take a vote on shutting down the plant, though whether the state would actually have the power to do that is unclear. The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses and regulates all reactors, and some experts predict lawsuits if Vermont tries a shutdown.",2008-05-28T08:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day

The International Atomic Energy Agency said Wednesday that there was no need for immediate alarm over the condition of the decommissioned plant, where workers have safeguarded nuclear waste since the Chernobyl disaster of 1986. But officials said the situation around the site remained a source of grave concern. Russian troops have occupied the facility since the early days of the invasion last month. The I.A.E.A., a United Nations agency, said the loss of power violated a “key safety pillar” but said it saw “no critical impact on safety” at this time because the amount of water in cooling ponds and around radioactive waste was sufficient to keep the nuclear material under control, even without continuous power to the plant. Part of the reason is that the used fuel assemblies are old and not as dangerous as they once were. The American Nuclear Society, a professional group, agreed. “The loss of power is a serious matter but it does not pose a threat to the public,” it said in a statement.",2022-03-10T02:50:49.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

No one thought the Interstate 35W bridge across the Mississippi River in Minneapolis would collapse. No one thought the Gulf of Mexico would be fouled to the horrible extent that it was by the BP oil spill. The awful convergence of disasters in Japan — a 9.0 earthquake followed by a tsunami and a devastating nuclear power emergency — seemed almost unimaginable. Worst-case scenarios unfold more frequently than we’d like to believe, which leads to two major questions regarding nuclear power that Americans have an obligation to answer. First, can a disaster comparable to the one in Japan happen here? The answer, of course, is yes — whether caused by an earthquake or some other event or series of events. Nature is unpredictable and human beings are fallible. It could happen. So the second question is whether it makes sense to follow through on plans to increase our reliance on nuclear power, thus heightening the risk of a terrible problem occurring here in the United States. Is that a risk worth taking? Concern over global warming has increased the appeal of nuclear power, which does not produce the high levels of greenhouse gases that come from fossil fuels. But there has been a persistent tendency to ignore the toughest questions posed by nuclear power: What should be done with the waste? What are the consequences of a catastrophic accident in a populated area? How safe are the plants, really? Why would taxpayers have to shoulder so much of the financial risk of expanding the nation’s nuclear power capacity, an effort that would be wildly expensive? A big part of the problem at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi power station are the highly radioactive spent fuel rods kept in storage pools at the plant. What to do, ultimately, with such dangerous waste material is the nuclear power question without an answer. Nuclear advocates and public officials don’t talk about it much. Denial is the default position when it comes to nuclear waste. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said again this week that the 40-year-old Indian Point nuclear power plant in Westchester County, 35 miles north of New York City, should be closed. Try to imagine the difficulty, in the event of an emergency, of evacuating such an area with its millions of residents. “This plant in this proximity to New York City was never a good risk,” said the governor. There are, blessedly, very few catastrophic accidents at nuclear power plants. And there have not been many deaths associated with them. The rarity of such accidents provides a comfort zone. We can look at the low probabilities and declare, “It can’t happen here.” But what if it did happen here? What would the consequences be? If Indian Point blew, how wide an area and how many people would be affected, and what would the cleanup costs be? Rigorously answering such questions is the only way to determine whether the potential risk to life and property is worthwhile. The 104 commercial nuclear plants in the U.S. are getting old, and many have had serious problems over the years. There have been dozens of instances since 1979, the year of the Three Mile Island accident, in which nuclear reactors have had to be shut down for more than a year for safety reasons. Building new plants, which the Obama administration favors, can be breathtakingly expensive and requires government loan guarantees. Banks are not lining up to lend money on their own for construction of the newest generation of Indian Points. In addition to the inherent risks with regard to safety and security, the nuclear industry has long been notorious for sky-high construction costs, feverish cost-overruns and projects that eventually are abandoned. The Union of Concerned Scientists, in a 2009 analysis of the costs associated with nuclear plant construction, said that once a plant came online it usually led to significant rate increases for customers: “Ratepayers bore well over $200 billion (in today’s dollars) in cost overruns for completed nuclear plants. In the 1990s, legislators and regulators also allowed utilities to recover most ‘stranded costs’ — the difference between utilities’ remaining investments in nuclear plants and the market value of those plants — as states issued billions of dollars in bonds backed by ratepayer charges to pay for utilities’ above-market investments.” The refrain here is familiar: “The total cost to ratepayers, taxpayers and shareholders stemming from cost overruns, canceled plants and stranded costs exceeded $300 billion in today’s dollars.” Nuclear power is hardly the pristine, economical, unambiguous answer to the nation’s energy needs and global warming concerns. It offers benefits and big-time shortcomings. Ultimately, the price may be much too high.",2011-03-19T03:06:59.000+01:00,NYTIMES,editorial-opinion

Beyond decarbonizing today’s electric grid, we must use clean electricity to replace fossil fuels in transportation, industry and heating. We must provide for the fast-growing energy needs of poorer countries and extend the grid to a billion people who now lack electricity. And still more electricity will be needed to remove excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by midcentury. Where will this gargantuan amount of carbon-free energy come from? The popular answer is renewables alone, but this is a fantasy. Wind and solar power are becoming cheaper, but they are not available around the clock, rain or shine, and batteries that could power entire cities for days or weeks show no sign of materializing any time soon. Today, renewables work only with fossil-fuel backup. Germany, which went all-in for renewables, has seen little reduction in carbon emissions , and, according to our calculations, at Germany’s rate of adding clean energy relative to gross domestic product, it would take the world more than a century to decarbonize, even if the country wasn’t also retiring nuclear plants early. A few lucky countries with abundant hydroelectricity, like Norway and New Zealand, have decarbonized their electric grids, but their success cannot be scaled up elsewhere: The world’s best hydro sites are already dammed. Small wonder that a growing response to these intimidating facts is, “We’re cooked.” But we actually have proven models for rapid decarbonization with economic and energy growth: France and Sweden. They decarbonized their grids decades ago and now emit less than a tenth of the world average of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour. They remain among the world’s most pleasant places to live and enjoy much cheaper electricity than Germany to boot. They did this with nuclear power. And they did it fast, taking advantage of nuclear power’s intense concentration of energy per pound of fuel. France replaced almost all of its fossil-fueled electricity with nuclear power nationwide in just 15 years ; Sweden, in about 20 years. In fact, most of the fastest additions of clean electricity historically are countries rolling out nuclear power. This is a realistic solution to humanity’s greatest problem. Plants built 30 years ago in America, as in France, produce cheap, clean electricity, and nuclear power is the cheapest source in South Korea. The 98 U.S. reactors today provide nearly 20 percent of the nation’s electricity generation. So why don’t the United States and other countries expand their nuclear capacity? The reasons are economics and fear. New nuclear power plants are hugely expensive to build in the United States today. This is why so few are being built. But they don’t need to be so costly. The key to recovering our lost ability to build affordable nuclear plants is standardization and repetition. The first product off any assembly line is expensive — it cost more than $150 million to develop the first iPhone — but costs plunge as they are built in quantity and production kinks are worked out. Yet as a former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  put it , while France has two types of reactors and hundreds of types of cheese, in the United States it’s the other way around. In recent decades, the United States and some European countries have created ever more complicated reactors, with ever more safety features in response to public fears. New, one-of-a-kind designs, shifting regulations, supply-chain and construction snafus and a lost generation of experts (during the decades when new construction stopped) have driven costs to absurd heights. These economic problems are solvable. China and South Korea can build reactors at one-sixth the current cost in the United States. With the political will, China could replace coal without sacrificing economic growth, reducing world carbon emissions by more than 10 percent. In the longer term, dozens of American start-ups are developing “fourth generation” reactors that can be mass-produced, potentially generating electricity at lower cost than fossil fuels. If American activists, politicians and regulators allow it, these reactors could be exported to the world in the 2030s and ’40s, slaking poorer countries’ growing thirst for energy while creating well-paying American jobs. Currently, fourth-generation nuclear power receives rare bipartisan agreement in Congress, making it a particularly appealing American policy to address climate change. Congress recently passed the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act by big margins. Both parties love innovation, entrepreneurship, exports and jobs. T his approach will need a sensible regulatory framework. Currently, as M.I.T.’s Richard Lester, a nuclear engineer, has written , a company proposing a new reactor design faces “the prospect of having to spend a billion dollars or more on an open-​ended, all‑or‑nothing licensing process without any certainty of outcomes.” We need government on the side of this clean-energy transformation, with supportive regulation, streamlined approval, investment in research and incentives that tilt producers and consumers away from carbon. All this, however, depends on overcoming an irrational dread among the public and many activists. The reality is that nuclear power is the safest form of energy humanity has ever used. Mining accidents, hydroelectric dam failures, natural gas explosions and oil train crashes all kill people, sometimes in large numbers, and smoke from coal-burning kills them in enormous numbers, more than half a million per year. By contrast, in 60 years of nuclear power, only three accidents have raised public alarm: Three Mile Island in 1979, which killed no one; Fukushima in 2011, which killed no one (many deaths resulted from the tsunami and some from a panicked evacuation near the plant); and Chernobyl in 1986, the result of extraordinary Soviet bungling, which killed 31 in the accident and perhaps several thousand from cancer, around the same number killed by coal emissions every day . (Even if we accepted recent claims that Soviet and international authorities covered up tens of thousands of Chernobyl deaths, the death toll from 60 years of nuclear power would still equal about one month of coal-related deaths.) Nuclear power plants cannot explode like nuclear bombs, and they have not contributed to weapons proliferation, thanks to robust international controls: 24 countries have nuclear power but not weapons, while Israel and North Korea have nuclear weapons but not power. Nuclear waste is compact — America’s total from 60 years would fit in a Walmart — and is safely stored in concrete casks and pools, becoming less radioactive over time. After we have solved the more pressing challenge of climate change, we can either burn the waste as fuel in new types of reactors or bury it deep underground. It’s a far easier environmental challenge than the world’s enormous coal waste, routinely dumped near poor communities and often laden with toxic arsenic, mercury and lead that can last forever . Despite its demonstrable safety, nuclear power presses several psychological buttons. First, people estimate risk according to how readily anecdotes like well-publicized nuclear accidents pop into mind. Second, the thought of radiation activates the mind-set of disgust, in which any trace of contaminant fouls whatever it contacts, despite the reality that we all live in a soup of natural radiation. Third, people feel better about eliminating a single tiny risk entirely than minimizing risk from all hazards combined. For all these reasons, nuclear power is dreaded while fossil fuels are tolerated, just as flying is scary even though driving is more dangerous. Opinions are also driven by our cultural and political tribes. Since the late 1970s, when No Nukes became a signature cause of the Green movement, sympathy to nuclear power became, among many environmentalists, a sign of disloyalty if not treason. Despite these challenges, psychology and politics can change quickly. As the enormity of the climate crisis sinks in and the hoped-for carbon savings from renewables don’t add up, nuclear can become the new green. Protecting the environment and lifting the developing world out of poverty are progressive causes. And the millennials and Gen Z’s might rethink the sacred values their boomer parents have left unexamined since the Doobie Brothers sang at the 1979 No Nukes concert. If the American public and politicians can face real threats and overcome unfounded fears, we can solve humanity’s most pressing challenge and leave our grandchildren a bright future of climate stability and abundant energy. We can dispatch, once and for all, the self-fulfilling prophesy that we’re cooked. Joshua S. Goldstein , professor emeritus of international relations at American University, and Staffan A.

e5360e41-65b8-472b-9abb-44070eb6030a,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/world/europe/britain-charts-way-to-wider-nuclear-investment.html,Britain Says It Will Add Reactors For Energy,"LONDON — Britain announced plans Tuesday to finance a new generation of nuclear power plants and renewable energy facilities in a move that illustrates divergent energy policies within the European Union as it grapples with the challenge of reconciling economic and environmental objectives. While Germany intends to phase out nuclear power and France’s new president, François Hollande, aims to reduce his country’s reliance on it, the British government appears to be moving in the opposite direction with its proposals, aimed at luring investment of £110 billion, or $175 billion, to build new reactors and renewable energy plants. The 27-member European Union sets climate change targets and co-ordinates efforts to reduce energy dependency, but decisions on energy sources remain with national governments. Britain’s proposals appear to be drafted to sidestep E.U. restrictions on state aid that might prevent direct subsidies for the construction of new nuclear power plants. Instead the plans, announced in draft legislation by the Department of Energy and Climate Change, would guarantee prices for low-carbon electricity and pay producers for backup supplies when renewable sources like wind power fail to meet demand. Britain hopes that this guaranteed price, to be paid by businesses and consumers, will secure the financial commitment from energy utilities to construct nuclear reactors and clean-power projects needed to meet European targets and reduce Britain’s reliance on natural gas plants. Recent developments suggest that could be a tough battle. In March, Britain’s nuclear program suffered a serious setback when two German companies, RWE and E.On, announced that they would not proceed with a £15 billion joint venture in Gloucester. The energy giants balked at the huge capital costs involved, blaming the economic crisis and arguing that the German government’s plan to phase out nuclear power had put additional pressure on their balance sheets. According to British news reports, Centrica has threatened to pull out of a project to build a new nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset in a joint venture with EDF Energy, the British subsidiary of the French giant EDF. To add to the difficulties, the main architect of Britain’s energy policy, Chris Huhne, quit the government in February to fight charges that he perverted the course of justice over a speeding offense in 2003. His successor, Edward Davey, said Tuesday that new plans were in the national interest and would support as many as 250,000 jobs. “By reforming the market, we can ensure security of supply for the long-term, reduce the volatility of energy bills by reducing our reliance on imported gas and oil, and meet our climate change goals by largely decarbonizing the power sector during the 2030s,” Mr. Davey said in a statement. That formulation hinted at a less ambitious timetable for reducing carbon emissions than that proposed by the British government’s independent advisory body, the Committee on Climate Change. The proposals have intensified debate over the cost and safety of nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster in Japan and the decisions by Germany and by Switzerland, which is not in the European Union, to phase out nuclear reactors. During the recent presidential election campaign, Mr. Hollande suggested reducing France’s dependence on nuclear power from around 75 percent to around 50 percent and shutting 24 of France’s 58 reactors by 2025. Critics attacked Britain’s determination to renew its nuclear capacity. “This proposal has distorted policy in order to try to disguise the massive subsidies nuclear will need, but they remain so huge that the policy will fail anyway,” said Tom Burke, a former environmental campaigner and visiting professor at Imperial and University Colleges, London, Industry reaction was far from euphoric. In a statement, Volker Beckers, chief executive of RWE Npower, said the investment required would add up to around £8,000 for every household in Britain. “For Britain to remain an attractive market for investors, energy policy must be given adequate priority and resource across government,” he said. “I remain concerned by the amount of change being implemented in the energy sector and the time it is taking,” Mr. Beckers added. “I applaud government’s appetite for reform, but pulling so many levers at once in such a complex area risks losing sight of your original objectives. What the energy sector needs now is simplicity and clarity.” Nuclear power stations currently produce around a third of the electricity and 15 percent of the energy consumed in the European Union, according to the bloc’s executive, the European Commission. In Britain, 16 reactors in nine nuclear power stations provided around 16 percent of electricity in 2010. But the government says that all but one of the existing nuclear power stations will have to be shut by 2023. Within the European Union, there are 147 nuclear power reactors, according to unofficial data collated by European officials. A new unit is under construction in Finland and France, and two each in Romania and Slovakia. A further seven have been approved by the national authorities, with five or six planned but not yet approved.",2012-05-23T00:36:57.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-europe

The relatively stiff requirements by a panel that included nuclear power supporters appeared to take Japan’s nuclear industry and its backers in government by surprise, and pose a challenge to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe just weeks into his term. Mr. Abe has made it clear that he wanted to restart Japan’s scores of idled reactors — all but two of which remain offline in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima plant disaster — and has even said that he wanted to build new ones. But he and his Liberal Democratic Party, the architect of Japan’s nuclear industry, already faced significant opposition from a population that was traumatized by the nuclear crisis that spread radioactive materials over a wide swath of the country’s northeast. The crisis at the Fukushima plant, which led to meltdowns in three reactors, started after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that swept through the plant, knocking out the electrical power needed to run crucial cooling systems. The guidelines require a secondary command center away from the reactor buildings so that workers can control emergency cooling systems and vents even if they are forced to pull back from the heart of the plant during an emergency. They also call for power companies to prepare for worse tsunamis than they had previously planned for, forcing at least some oceanside plants to raise sea walls, a costly endeavor. The rules also ban power companies from building or operating reactors on top of active faults, but continuing contentious discussions over what an “active” fault consists of might allow the government to avoid closing such plants for good. Many of the proposed regulations bring Japan in line with standards in the United States. The new guidelines are the latest step in Japan’s struggle to chart its energy future after the disaster. Previous governments led by the Democratic Party had given vague promises to phase out nuclear power as polls indicated that many people feared nuclear power and remained worried that the collusive ties between government and the industry that left the country vulnerable to disaster were ones that could not be broken. But Mr. Abe has argued that keeping the reactors idle would hinder a recovery he is trying to jump-start with promises to tackle deflation that have already led to a weakening in the yen welcomed by struggling exporters. Nuclear energy had provided 30 percent of the nation’s electricity needs before the disaster. With virtually all of its reactors offline, Japan has been forced to import more fossil fuels, driving resource-poor Japan to a record annual trade deficit last year. Before the accident, the country consistently posted large trade surpluses. Still, Mr. Abe’s ability to sway the panel — or try to overrule it — might be limited. The regulatory body has been given significant autonomy, and is able to take a wide range of actions without government approval, partly as a result of maneuvering by Mr. Abe’s own party when it was out of power. Fearing the anti-nuclear agenda of some in the then-ruling Democratic Party, the Liberal Democrats had demanded that the body be insulated from political pressure. But supporters of Japan’s powerful nuclear industry appeared to be starting a campaign Friday to ensure that the rules did not go into effect as they were. “If we don’t have a stable energy supply, how are businesses supposed to invest and help Japan grow?” Hiromasa Yonekura, chairman of the Japan Business Federation, told reporters Friday. Japan’s ten nuclear operators, including Tokyo Electric Power, the operator of the ravaged Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, could pay a total of 1 trillion yen to make the required reinforcements, the Nikkei business daily reported Friday, quoting estimates from the power companies. The panel is expected to finalize the rules in July after a public hearing process, and there are lingering suspicions among anti-nuclear activists that the new panel will ultimately go easy on the country’s nuclear operators. Though nuclear power plants must meet the new guidelines before reactor restarts are cleared, the panel has left open the possibility that some standards could be suspended to allow limited reactor restarts. The five-member nuclear authority was put in place after complaints that previous regulators were too close to industry.",2013-02-02T03:23:53.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Like nearly all incidents at nuclear power plants here, the one on Wednesday prompted demands that France reduce its dependence on nuclear power. France gets about 75 percent of its electricity from nuclear energy, and President François Hollande during his campaign promised to work toward reducing the use of nuclear plants and to close the two Fessenheim reactors by 2017, when they will be 40. The power company Électricité de France, which operates the plant, has argued that the life of the reactors, drawing water from the Rhine River, can be extended safely. Some consider Fessenheim overly vulnerable to seismic activity and to flooding, but the plants provide much of the employment in the area, 30 miles north of Basel, Switzerland, and next to Germany. The power company said Wednesday that “steam escaped during a maintenance operation,” setting off a fire alarm, and that the incident had been quickly brought under control. The prefecture of Haut-Rhin said that there was a release of “oxygenated steam” when hydrogen peroxide reacted with water in a reservoir. Workers were preparing a cleaning fluid in an annex separate from the reactor buildings when the incident occurred. Nuclear safety authorities said there was no threat of radioactive leaks, and the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy said in a statement that there was no safety risk. François de Rugy, co-president of the environmental group in the National Assembly, said that the accident at Fessenheim served “to remind everyone that there is a danger with nuclear power.” The Socialist government is allied with the environmentalist Green party, and there has been a debate inside the government over how quickly to move away from nuclear power, given the recession and the cost of alternative energy sources.",2012-09-05T22:28:18.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-europe

The announcement represented an about-face for Mr. Macron, who had previously pledged to reduce France’s reliance on nuclear power but has pivoted to burnishing an image as a pronuclear president battling climate change as he faces a tough re-election bid in April. “What our country needs is the rebirth of France’s nuclear industry,” Mr. Macron said at a nuclear turbine factory in the industrial city of Belfort in eastern France as throngs of workers and political officials gathered around. “The time has come for a nuclear renaissance,” he added. Mr. Macron’s move is seen as a pivotal moment in a growing debate over nuclear power in Europe. The divide has taken on new dimensions as leaders pledge to avert a climate catastrophe and grapple with an energy crisis that has sent prices for natural gas and electricity surging to record highs — in part because nuclear energy production has fallen.",2022-02-10T21:11:02.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

The details, filled in over the last two weeks by one alarming report after another, show a potentially catastrophic pattern of cost-cutting along with 16 years of cover-ups of serious flaws, apparently in an effort to preserve public trust. The pattern includes the systematic falsification of inspection and repair records at 13 reactors at the company, Tokyo Electric, the world's largest private electrical utility. Compounding the public relations disaster, a reactor that the company operates in Fukushima Prefecture, in northern Japan, was closed temporarily last week because a chimney was emitting more than 100 times the usual level of radiation. In accordance with the ritualized apologies that Japanese business culture demands, the president of Tokyo Electric, Nobuya Minami, and four other senior officials resigned. But many Japanese are talking about a far larger casualty, the rock-solid consensus behind nuclear energy that has existed here for decades, and which has made Japan's industry the world's third-largest, behind the United States and France, and perhaps its most ambitious. Even senior members of the government have expressed their outrage over the scandal. ''It is absolutely abominable that this incident caused the people's confidence to be largely lost in nuclear energy,'' said Takeo Hiranuma, the industry minister. Statements like his are almost unheard; for decades the government has been an almost unconditional backer of nuclear power. But a groundswell has been building against nuclear power here for at least three years. It began when cost-cutting and sloppy work led to a fission chain-reaction at a uranium-processing plant in Tokaimura, 70 miles northeast of Tokyo, in 1999. The anger gained momentum last year after investigators discovered that radioactive coolant water had been leaking, undetected, from cracks in the aging reactor vessel in Hamaoka for at least four months. The Tokaimura incident was Japan's worst nuclear-related accident. Two people were killed, thousands of people were exposed to at least moderate levels of radiation and the town center had to be temporarily evacuated during a cleanup. Company officials have said they were worried that if the public became aware of cracking at the reactors, people would be frightened. Today, it was learned that the government gave Tokyo Electric the name of the whistle-blower who reported the cracking to the company, in a further effort to keep things quiet. The Tokaimura accident shocked the nation, and critics of the nuclear industry now say the government's condemnations of safety lapses and fraud may be too little too late. Since Tokaimura, local communities have voted in referendums to block new plants, and in other cases mayors and governors have promised to do so. That has galvanized action against the nuclear power industry as never before. ''At first, people had no other choice but to trust the government, because this is such important technology,'' Eisaku Sato, the governor of Fukushima Prefecture, where some of the troubled Tokyo Electric plants are located, said Wednesday. ''Then this incident occurred, and the trust between us, which was never more than a thin red thread, was completely cut off.'' Just one day earlier, Masazumi Nishikawa, the mayor of Kashiwazaki City, in Niigata Prefecture, told Tokyo Electric to cancel its plans to introduce a plutonium fuel into a conventional local reactor which was designed to burn uranium. The prefectural governor, Ikuo Hirayama, has seconded the mayor's moves. Antinuclear activists say they can now foresee a day when Japan joins countries like Germany and Belgium in banning new nuclear plant construction. Plant construction in the United States has long been frozen though not banned. ''This kind of scandal, where there have been cover-ups for 10 years, causes a fatal doubt of government policy on nuclear energy,'' said Kiyoshi Sakurai, an industry critic and a physicist. ''We will end up like Americans and some European countries, turning away from nuclear energy.'' Nuclear-generated electricity has been the bedrock of Japan's energy policy since the oil shocks of the 1970's, which hit Japan far worse than the United States, considering that Japan was a manufacturing economy without local supplies of oil. The country embarked on a crash program to build dozens of nuclear power plants. But it also poured tens of billions of dollars into the development of plutonium-burning reactors, known as fast breeder reactors; their technology, though unproven, theoretically would produce more nuclear fuel than they burn. The United States abandoned similar plans during the Ford administration, citing safety concerns, and since then, international nuclear energy experts and antinuclear activists in Japan have raised a host of other objections, from infeasibility to the terror-related risks of shipping vast stocks of plutonium internationally and around Japan. But the Japanese government has continued to spend heavily on developing plutonium-based reactors, even despite a sodium leak and a fire at its prototype fast-breeder reactor at Monju in 1992. ''There is a single-minded commitment to nuclear power,'' said Edwin Lyman, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, an independent group in Washington doing research on nuclear nonproliferation. ''The government clearly sees promoting nuclear power as its policy, because the bureaucrats absolutely believe that this is the key to their energy future for the next 200 years.'' The biggest liabilities faced by Japan's huge nuclear power industry are not the technologies of the future, but an accident-plagued present in which embarrassing failures in aging reactors have become disturbingly commonplace. The most frightening revelation in the unfolding Tokyo Power scandal has been that falsified inspection records had papered over large cracks in the stainless steel shrouds that cover the core of nuclear plants, allowing the reactors to operate for years without costly repairs. For many, this recalled an explosion at a nuclear plant operated by the Nagoya-based Chubu Electric Power Company, at Hamaoka, last November. The investigation there revealed the radioactive leaks. The Hamaoka plant began operating in 1976, and antinuclear activists in Japan have seized upon incidents like the one last year as evidence that many of Japan's 53 nuclear reactors, operating well into their third decade, are aging and a safety risk. Aging has emerged as a major concern in the United States, too, particularly since the discovery in March of a hole in the top of the reactor vessel at the Davis-Besse reactor, near Toledo, Ohio. Unforeseen corrosion by boric acid has nearly eaten through the six-inch thick steel vessel that contains the reactor's core, and American investigators are also looking into whether inspection or repair records at the plant have been falsified. In an interview before the Tokyo Power scandals, Shojiro Masuura, chairman of Japans Nuclear Safety Commission, denied that aging of nuclear plants was a problem. ''In Japan there is no relationship between accidents and aging,'' he said. Regarding the Hamaoka leaks, he added, ''the reactors fractures don't really relate to aging at all.'' American nuclear energy experts have expressed astonishment at that line of thinking. ''Something has happened to the Japanese, and it doesn't look good,'' said Victor Galinsky, a former member of the Nuclear Regulator Commission. ''I just can't imagine that any engineer, technical person or technical bureaucrat can deny that aging is a problem.''",2002-09-16T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

But data show that they need to develop much faster to wean the world from fossil fuels in time to meet the Paris agreement goals and to forestall the worst effects of climate change. Assuming that the current generation of solar and wind power alone can power the world of the future could be dangerously optimistic. More must be done. As noted, many countries are also moving ahead with nuclear. Next-generation nuclear offers the possibility of lower costs and greater safety than the current generation of plants. The megacities of the developing world will need to maintain a minimum supply of power for 24 hours to provide reliable electricity for all; other than fossil fuels, only nuclear can provide this baseload power.

A worker checks the radioactivity of drums containing nuclear waste at a power plant near Seoul, South Korea. Lee Jin-man/AP I’ve been seeing a lot of commentary lately about how nuclear power could help to solve the climate change problem. These articles usually mention how nuclear power yields virtually zero greenhouse gas emissions and how — unlike wind or solar — nuclear is ready to go and creates the same vast and steady supplies of power as traditional power stations fired by fossils fuels like gas and coal. In a masterful summary of some of the recent literature about climate change for the London Review of Books , John Lanchester identifies nuclear as “the least worst solution to our urgent need for a carbon-free fuel source.” Yet green groups like Friends of the Earth remain hugely skeptical. They say the industry has long relied on subsidies to be affordable, and they warn of lethal accidents and a growing stockpile of materials that could be turned into nuclear weapons. I’ll be writing more about the issue in Thursday’s Business of Green column in the International Herald Tribune, but where do you think things are heading?

From inadequate risk models and low tsunami walls before the disaster to reassurances afterward that seem designed to placate rather than protect people, operators and proponents of nuclear power have squandered the public trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, public apprehension about nuclear power is not driven by irrational fear or a poor understanding of science. The public simply does not believe the self-interested reassurances it is being given that nuclear power is safe.

The accompanying tsunami, they learned, had swamped a Cameco customer: the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Suddenly, this strategy meeting would be anything but routine. “We had kind of a fortuitous convergence,” said Gerald W. Grandey, the chief executive of Cameco, which held the meeting near its headquarters in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Fortuitous, but not fortunate — for Cameco or the rest of the uranium industry, whose products fuel the world’s nuclear power plants. Over the last five years, uranium miners and processors — and their stock prices — have generally benefited from the assumption that rising energy demand in developing countries, and global concerns about greenhouse gas emissions, were creating a new appreciation for nuclear power industry. Shares of Cameco had reached a recent high of $43.14 in mid-February, reflecting a steady rise from a low of $16 in October 2008. But since the tsunami, shares of Cameco have closed as low as $30.82, and closed Friday at $31.17. Unusually rich ore deposits, particularly at Cameco’s main deep-rock mine in northern Saskatchewan, help make it a low-cost producer. Uranium mining requires costly robotic systems and other measures to protect workers and the environment from radiation. Cameco produces about 16 percent of the world’s uranium supply and dominates the market, along with Areva, a French company with 17 percent of production, and the British-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto, which also holds a 16 percent share. But compared with those more diversified companies, Cameco is essentially a pure-play uranium producer. The Tokyo Electric Power Company, which owns that power plant, is not only a buyer of nuclear fuel from Cameco, among other suppliers. Tepco, as it is known, also holds a small stake in a Canadian mine that Cameco plans to open in 2013 as part of its goal to double production by 2018, which would make it the global leader in uranium. Right now, most of the rest of the world is pausing to assess the future of its nuclear power programs. In Germany, a market for Cameco, Chancellor Angela Merkel has temporarily shut down seven nuclear plants and suspended a program for extending the life of aging reactors. And Italy, has suspended a plan to resume its nuclear power program, which it had stopped after the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl. But for all that, Mr. Grandey said this week that he was still optimistic about the long-term future of nuclear power. He says he thinks the nuclear renaissance is only taking a temporary pause. “Even with Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and now Fukushima, nuclear still has an impeccable safety record,” Mr. Grandey said in an interview. “There will be in time — I’m looking five, seven years — a rapid acceleration of nuclear building putting us back on track to where we would have been, absent Fukushima.” Not everyone, of course, shares Mr. Grandey’s optimism, or his assessment of the industry’s safety record. But there is no question that Cameco’s future depends largely on the world’s appetite for processed uranium after Fukushima. Even if there is a global pullback on developing new power plants, Cameco has something of a cushion with its current customers. The company generally has multiyear contracts with utilities that require them to pay for fuel even if they do not accept delivery. (The company has suspended some contract terms for Tokyo Electric and another Japanese utility with reactors in the heavily damaged north, Tohoku Electric Power. Long-term Japan accounts for about 18 to 20 percent of Cameco’s contracted sales.) Farther out, Mr. Grandey bases his optimism on the inexorable rise in energy demand by developing economies like China and India, which have both indicated that they do not plan to curtail their ambitious rollout of new nuclear plants though they will proceed with a greater sense of caution. Fossil fuels, whether for environmental issues, supply constraints or price uncertainties, simply cannot meet the world’s needs, he said. “It will take us six months a year to digest and learn the lessons of Fukushima,” he said. “After we digest the lessons learned, I think we’ll get back on the path of nuclear construction.” Joshua M. Pearce, a professor of mechanical and engineering at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, said that such analysis omitted an important factor. “This is not the 1950s when there was just nuclear and fossil fuels,” he said, noting that alternative energy sources like solar and wind had become increasingly viable. Professor Pearce was a co-author of a recent academic paper about indirect subsidies to nuclear power plants. He estimates that insurance liability caps granted to the American nuclear power industry, for example, produce an annual indirect subsidy of $33 million for every reactor in the United States. He said that the liability costs to the Japanese government arising from Fukushima Daiichi, while still impossible to estimate, were presumably large, and might make other governments see that offering subsidies to renewable energy sources might be a comparative bargain. Tony Ward, who heads Ernst & Young’s power and utility practice in London, agrees that the current crisis will focus new attention on wind and solar power, particularly in China, which has already heavily invested in renewable energy technologies. But Mr. Ward points to a significant limit to renewable energy as an alternative to nuclear. “The supply chain is not sufficiently deep to provide the sheer scale of capacity that is sufficient,” he said. For Mr. Ward, one potential long-term change for Cameco stemming from the Fukushima Daiichi disaster is the issue of spent fuel storage — which has been a big source of the trouble at that plant. He expects governments to reassess the economics of reprocessing nuclear waste into new fuel rather than allowing its continued storage. But Cameco’s Mr. Grandey, voicing optimism, insists that the nuclear industry’s image will suffer no long-term harm. “The numbers that are questioning safety have gone up but that’s inevitable,” Mr. Grandy said. “But it certainly can’t be described as a mass change in attitude toward nuclear.” He added: “I think the public also understands that these are 35- and 40-year-old plants. So like airplanes that occasionally fall out of the sky, or like other industrial activities that experience disasters, every industry learns and improves.”",2011-03-26T01:48:25.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

Wall Street ended loans for new reactors in the late 1970s because of high costs. After a decade in which a nuclear revival has been promoted, only two new plants are under construction, and they are slowed by costly delays. After 15 years of no shutdowns, four American reactors have closed this year, with more shutdowns predicted. Executives claim that nuclear power cannot compete in the marketplace with sources like natural gas and wind. The underlying reason for high nuclear costs is that reactors are dangerous, requiring many highly trained staff members, a complexity of expensive parts, compliance with extensive regulations, and antiterrorist measures to minimize public exposure to hazardous radioactivity. The 1954 promise by the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Lewis Strauss, that nuclear power would be “too cheap to meter” remains unfulfilled. JOSEPH MANGANO Executive Director Radiation and Public Health Project Ocean City, N.J., Aug. 22, 2013 To the Editor: Eduardo Porter has grasped the fundamental issue: Fossil fuels are becoming unacceptable, and nuclear can compete. With nuclear generators averaging 90 percent of capacity year round, wind at 30 percent and solar at 15 percent just do not cut it. Also, the intermittent nature of making electricity from the wind and the sun will always relegate those sources to minor status. How can you run an economy when the power dies on calm or cloudy days? The upfront cost of nuclear is indeed daunting, but the reality is that those costs are spread over 60 or more years. That’s why today’s nuclear plants are such bargains, having been efficiently producing power for decades after the big initial investment. Operating under the strict regulations in this country, nuclear energy is safe and clean, and the next generation of plants is even better. There are not a lot of good choices in energy today, but nuclear is one of them. EDWARD L.

The cabinet of Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said it would “take into consideration” the 2040 goal, but formally endorsed only a vague promise to “engage in debate with local governments and international society and to gain public understanding” in deciding Japan’s economic future in the wake of the 2011 nuclear disaster at Fukushima. Energy policy will be developed “with flexibility, based on tireless verification and re-examination,” the cabinet’s resolution read. A day earlier, the chairmen of Japan’s most prominent business associations, including the influential Keidanren group, called a rare joint news conference to demand that Mr. Noda abandon the 2040 goal. On Wednesday, they praised the cabinet’s decision. The deadline “was not a viable option in the first place,” Tadashi Okamura, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said at a news conference. Nuclear critics had been suspicious of the government’s promise last week, saying the announced plans were vague and drawn out, and included troubling loopholes. On Wednesday, after the cabinet’s rollback, they called the government indecisive and weak-kneed. “We’ve only seen the government strike compromise after compromise with the business community,” said Hideyuki Ban, secretary general of a nuclear watchdog, the Citizens’ Nuclear Information Center . Motohisa Furukawa, the national strategy minister, announced the original plan last week, releasing a document titled the “Revolutionary Energy and Environment Strategy” that said Japan would seek to eliminate nuclear power within 28 years through greater reliance on renewable energy, conservation and the use of fossil fuels. On Wednesday, he defended the cabinet’s omission of the 2040 deadline, saying the government had intended to use it as a reference point. “It is just a matter of decision-making, and there is no real change to content,” he said. But to critics, the cabinet’s move cast into further doubt Japan’s commitment to ending its nuclear power program, first made in July 2011 by Naoto Kan , who was then prime minister. Since September, his successor, Mr. Noda, has pushed to restart the energy-poor country’s shuttered reactors while making vague promises to “reduce Japan’s nuclear dependence.” Japan got about 30 percent of its electricity from 54 reactors across the country — and planned to increase its reliance to 50 percent — before damage from a powerful tsunami in March 2011 led to multiple meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and vast radiation leaks. All but two of the plants remain closed. Mr. Noda was forced to consider alternative energy sources after a series of public hearings held by the government  after the Fukushima disaster showed overwhelming support for phasing out nuclear power. The unmistakable theme of the hearings was mistrust of the government’s ability to oversee nuclear safety. But business groups criticized any move away from nuclear power as impractical and a death knell for Japanese manufacturers, which have already lost much of their competitive edge to cheaper rivals elsewhere in Asia. And communities across Japan that host nuclear facilities feared losing government subsidies, tax revenues and jobs.They also worried that they would become the final dumping ground for spent nuclear fuel stored at their plants. The government’s reversal came as it officially opened a new agency on Wednesday to oversee the nuclear industry, a bid to regain the public’s trust. Japan got rid of its previous nuclear regulator after criticism that it had been drawn into a cozy, collusive relationship with plant operators and had failed to take the necessary steps to prevent a disaster like Fukushima. But the new body has already come under fire, with criticism focusing on Shunichi Tanaka, the head of a five-person committee that would set nuclear policy and retain oversight over the new agency. Mr. Tanaka is considered suspect by those who favor tighter regulation because he helped lead a former government commission tasked with building a strong nuclear industry, raising fears that the new regulator will be as lax as the previous one. Yukio Edano, the minister of economy, trade and industry, said that the new regulatory framework ensured that there was “a strict separation between those who regulate nuclear power and those who use it.” The government will help create “the highest-level regulations and disaster-preparedness plans in the world,” Mr. Edano said.",2012-09-19T16:22:52.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The company, Areva, which is owned mostly by the French government, said on Wednesday that it had joined with the state-run Nuclear Power Corporation of India to build at least two and possibly as many as six nuclear power plants in the energy-starved country. Their two-reactor project could be worth about $10 billion, officials from the French company and the Indian government said. The deal with Areva could satisfy most of India’s near-term nuclear requirements. The State Department of the United States estimated recently that India would import as many as eight new nuclear reactors by 2012. “India is a first-tier partner and customer,” Areva’s chief executive, Anne Lauvergeon, said here on Wednesday. President George W. Bush’s administration led the push to lift a three-decade ban on the import of nuclear fuel and technology to India. Many analysts say they believe the effort was to open a lucrative market for American companies like Westinghouse Electric, owned by Toshiba, and General Electric, both of which build nuclear reactors. Executives from United States companies have been frequent visitors to India in recent years as the nuclear talks progressed. In September, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, a global consortium that regulates the sale of the items, voted to lift the ban on deals with India, freeing up any country to sign nuclear plant deals here. Despite Areva’s coup, rival companies say they are still focusing on India. GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, a division of G.E. that led a recent United States nuclear delegation to India “continues to work with many officials of the Indian government and nuclear companies as they identify sites where U.S. companies can support India’s nuclear energy needs,” Steve Hucik, a vice president with the G.E. division, said on Wednesday. India plans to expand its nuclear capacity tenfold in the next 20 years, he said, which will “potentially create significant opportunities” for United States companies, including G.E. Nuclear Power of India already operates India’s 17 nuclear reactors and is building five more. The company is considering plans to build reactors at four coastal locations in cooperation with France, the United States and Russia, the company said on Wednesday. Nuclear Power plans to add 16,000 megawatts to its existing power generation by 2020 to meet rising demand and help avoid the severe shortages that cause daily blackouts in many parts of the country. That may require 20 reactors. Areva will supply India with at least two of its new reactors, known as EPRs, which the company says are easier to build, longer lasting and more energy-efficient than older reactors. Under the terms of the agreement, it will also supply India with the fuel for the reactors during their lifetimes. EPRs have drawn criticism from Greenpeace, which contends that their waste is many times more radioactive than that from conventional reactors. Areva denies that.",2009-02-04T22:30:59.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-world-business

However, nuclear power has proved to be an unsafe, unreliable, uneconomical energy source, and we would be better off pursuing the other anti-greenhouse steps you recommend: phasing out chlorofluorocarbons, developing solar power, conserving energy and preserving forests. Future reactors may prove to be less susceptible to meltdown than current plants. Or they may not; the technologies are still untested. We do know that they will not be safe: any process that produces radioactive material is inherently unsafe. Even low doses of radiation can cause genetic damage, and nuclear waste remains radioactive for 250,000 years. Construction of nuclear plants is so expensive that it has led utilities into bankruptcy and exorbitant rate increases in many regions, as Long Island Lighting Company ratepayers are painfully aware. For all that money, consumers received an unreliable source of power: nuclear utilities have operated at less than 60 percent of capacity over the last 15 years. Cheaper, safer energy is available. As Peter Passell's Jan. 18 Economic Scene column pointed out, meeting higher efficiency standards for refrigerators would alone eliminate the need to build 14 Shoreham-size power plants. Furthermore, renewable energy sources already supply 9 percent of America's total energy (more than nuclear does), and their contribution is expected to double by the year 2000. While new renewable technologies like solar photovoltaic cells are developing, efficient natural gas plants offer a low-carbon alternative at one-third the cost and one-fifth the construction time of nuclear reactors. Yes, the greenhouse effect is for real, and it calls for a rapid, effective, environmentally sound response that should not include nuclear power.

Bradford, chairman of the Maine Public Utilities Commission, says that, contrary to the opinions of some people in the industry, he is not against nuclear power. ''There is within the nuclear power industry a core of zealots who have defined as anti-nuclear anyone who doesn't want nuclear power on their terms,'' Mr. Bradford said in a telephone interview. ''I like to think of myself as anti-pro-nuclear.'' Mr. Bradford will not express his views on the troubled Seabrook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire, but actions taken by the commission clearly suggest that its members do not think highly of the project. In December Mr. Bradford and other commission members ordered three Maine utilities, which collectively own 9.7 percent of Seabrook and have invested more than $400 million in construction there, to find buyers for their holdings and get out. ''We are more or less acting like a court in this situation,'' Mr. Bradford said. ''The companies need our approval to do the financings that would raise money for Seabrook, and they need approval to raise rates.'' On Feb. 8 the Maine utilities - the Central Maine Power Company, the Bangor Hydro-Electric Company and the Maine Public Service Company - reported that two Massachusetts utilities that already own part of Seabrook had offered to buy an additional 4.7 percent of the plant but at book value, far below replacement cost. The Maine companies have repeatedly said that an order to walk away from Seabrook, now more than 80 percent complete, would subject them to huge damage suits from the other participants. They also have filed appeals challenging the commission's ruling. Mr. Bradford, who is 42, is no stranger to controversy. From 1977 through 1981, he was a member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This was a period that included the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Pennsylvania. ''During my time on the N.R.C. we licensed about 20 to 25 nuclear power plants,'' Mr. Bradford said. ''My feeling about nuclear power then was that if a utility needed 1,000 or so megawatts of generating capacity, and if the plant could meet the regulations and get through the licensing process, then a nuclear plant was preferable to a coal or an oil plant. I still think that.'' But in recent years, he added, it has become ''increasingly questionable'' whether the need for electricity is great enough to justify the high costs of nuclear plant construction. A graduate of Yale and its law school, Mr. Bradford is married and the father of two children. His term on the Maine Public Utilities Commission expires in 1987.",1985-02-18T07:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,financial-desk-business-day

The existing nuclear power fleet provides significant benefits to our country, providing 20 percent of our power and 64 percent of our carbon-free energy. Because these plants generate emissions-free electricity, they are key to achieving the clean energy future that we all strive for, including President Obama’s carbon-cutting goals, which likely could not be met in many states without these nuclear plants.

Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said seven plants that went online before 1980 would be temporarily closed and the time would be used to study speedier adoption of renewable energy. All of the plants were built by German contractors. While Mrs. Merkel asserted that safety was her main concern, opposition politicians accused her of pandering to fear about nuclear power ahead of a regional election this month. She has, in effect, suspended a decision last autumn to keep older plants operating beyond their previously designated life span. The tests across the European Union are intended to ensure preparedness for emergencies like floods and tsunamis, as well as terrorist attacks, the European energy commissioner, Günther Oettinger, said after meeting with representatives of the nuclear industry, electricity companies and governments. “This is a reassessment, if you like, of all potential risks in the wake of what has happened in Japan,” Mr. Oettinger said. The Japanese disaster has led officials in Europe and the United States to think twice about nuclear expansion. But for now, developing countries, while acknowledging the need for safety, say their energy needs give them little choice but to continue investing in nuclear power. A crucial element, Mr. Oettinger said, would be to determine whether the plants had enough backup power to cool the reactors if electricity was lost. The loss of backup power after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan led to overheating and explosions at the Fukushima plant. Mr. Oettinger, who became energy commissioner with Mrs. Merkel’s support, appeared Tuesday to shift his attitude toward nuclear energy. “We must also raise the question if we in Europe, in the foreseeable future, can secure our energy needs without nuclear energy,” he told the German TV station ARD. In his native state of Baden-Württemberg, where Mrs. Merkel’s party risks losing power in March 27 elections, Mr. Oettinger was known as a proponent of nuclear power. The state has two plants, one of which is among the seven to be shut down. On Saturday, about 50,000 protesters formed a human chain from the state capital, Stuttgart, to that reactor. On Monday, an estimated 110,000 people demonstrated in 450 towns across Germany against extending nuclear power. Both Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Oettinger said President Nicolas Sarkozy of France would raise nuclear safety at the next Group of 20 nations summit meeting. Mr. Oettinger said the tests should include as many plants in the European Union as possible. Nuclear power produces around a third of the electricity and 15 percent of the energy consumed in the European Union. The chief executive of the German power giant E.On, Johannes Teyssen, said he would welcome more common standards for European nuclear safety. He declined, however, to rule out power cutoffs as a result of Mrs. Merkel’s decision, noting that “obviously depends on several factors of demand and supply, on availability of transmission grids, on a lot of issues.” “With this new unbalance in the system, minor accidents can have major implications,” Mr. Teyssen said in Brussels. “We will try our best to live up to the situation, but the risk of the system has definitely increased.” The industry made a similar threat almost a year ago when Mrs. Merkel agreed to extend the life of the power plants if the utilities paid a special tax. The utilities said the tax would hinder investment. Germany has 17 nuclear plants. They provide 26 percent of the country’s electricity; the seven older reactors produce about a third of that percentage. European operators already face narrowing choices over where to locate reactors. In France, which relies on nuclear energy for more than 75 percent of its electricity, hot water discharged by power stations can combine with rising air temperatures to warm rivers enough in the summer to threaten fish and plant life. But building plants on seafronts, where cold water is abundant, may be less attractive because of storms and rising sea levels linked to climate change. A total of 17 reactors in the European Union use technology similar to those affected in Japan, which are known as boiling water reactors, according to the European Commission. Of those 17, nine in Finland and Sweden are on coastlines, according to the Nuclear Energy Agency, part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. About 40 percent of the reactors in the union’s member states are on coastlines, according to the commission. The Continent has comparatively weak earthquakes. Even so, nature can pose a threat. During a storm in 1999, rising water levels in the Gironde River led to severe flooding at the French plant Blayais, shutting down some safety systems. Since then, Électricité de France, which runs the plant, has improved protections at Blayais. Stress tests would have common standards, Mr. Oettinger said, but “if you have a plant which is on the coast, well then obviously flooding and tsunamis will be tested for perhaps more thoroughly than plants situated at much greater altitude.” The nuclear crisis in Japan is also complicating the debate over whether to pursue nuclear energy in Chile, which only last year suffered an 8.8-magnitude earthquake that caused devastation, officials said this week. Next week, Chile and the United States are expected to sign a memorandum of understanding on nuclear cooperation when President Obama visits Santiago. But given the disaster in Japan, Chile’s energy and mining minister, Laurence Golborne, told reporters the government needed to study the situation. “We may decide we don’t want this type of energy and we will have to analyze other sources,” he said. “The country needs energy, and to say no to something means saying yes to other things.”",2011-03-15T21:54:01.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-global-business

The clouds of Chernobyl have long passed, but two years later the shadows still linger over Western Europe. The worst fears that seized Europeans after the Chernobyl power plant in the Ukraine ruptured in April 1986 and sent a radioactive plume swirling across the Continent have not been realized. Yet the receding fears have left an indelible imprint on the Continent, ranging from still-heightened radiation levels in some lands to an anti-nuclear movement that has scored major blows against nuclear power and even dislodged an Italian Government. Fallibility and Distrust Beyond that, in unmeasurable ways, ''Chernobyl'' entered the European vocabulary as an affirmation that the unthinkable can happen. In parliamentary debates, in editorials, in conversations, it is a word that now denotes the fallibility of technology and a distrust of official assurances. Stewart Boyle, energy campaigner for Friends of the Earth, Britain's largest environmentalist group, says the fear people felt immediately after Chernobyl has been replaced by a ''very deep cynicism'' about the truthfulness of information produced by nuclear energy officials. A study by the European Community estimated that over the next 50 years, Chernobyl was likely to be responsible for about 1,000 extra cancer deaths, a statistically negligible addition to the 30 million deaths from ''natural'' cancers projected over that same time in the 12-member Community's population of 315 million. Where Toll Is Direct The study also concluded that the average individual radiation dose caused by Chernobyl in the entire European Community would be considerably less over 50 years than the effective average dose in one year from natural background radiation. But in some parts of Europe, Chernobyl continues to exact a direct toll. Though tests in Britain have found that people in contaminated areas generally retained a ''reassuringly small'' amount of Chernobyl radiation, some were found with abnormal levels. They included Ned Williams and his wife, Gwyneth, owners of a 500-acre sheep farm in a remote corner of Wales. Higher Radiation Levels In one of the most dramatic cases, Mr. Williams, 48 years old, was recently found to have 4,118 becquerels of radioactivity for every kilogram of his body, 10 times the average level found among men in North Wales. Mrs. Williams, 44, was found to have 2,372 becquerels a kilogram, nine times the average for women in North Wales. ''My main worry is getting sick,'' Mr. Williams said in a telephone interview, adding that he thought that Chernobyl ''has definitely increased my chances of getting cancer.'' ''You know, up to now, I've been pretty healthy, working out of doors all my life,'' he said. ''It just makes you wonder why people keep building these nuclear power plants, you know? All we need is one more accident closer to home and then everybody will test as high as I have.'' Some 300,000 sheep in northern Britain cannot be slaughtered for food because of high radiation levels. In northern Sweden, herds of reindeer must commute between grazing grounds in double-decker trucks to avoid stretches of contaminated lichen. A Temporary Dip in Births Wild mushrooms, berries and lake fish are still looked on with suspicion in several countries, including Sweden, West Germany and Italy. Switzerland continues to ban fishing on its half of Lake Lugano, even though Italy has lifted restrictions in its half. A different legacy was registered in Italy, where official statistics showed a temporary dip in births starting nine months after the Chernobyl accident, evidently because many prospective parents delayed having babies until after the dust had settled. Some playgrounds in Munich, in southern West Germany, were recently found to have above-normal radioactive levels, which were attributed to sand unchanged after Chernobyl. Though claims for compensation have subsided, governments continue to spend millions on monitoring and research. Since the Chernobyl accident, Britain alone has spent $:3 million pounds ($5.4 million) on research and $:5.5 million ($9.9 million) on compensating sheep farmers. #400,000 Claims in West Germany In West Germany, 400,000 claims were filed for compensation, most by milk and vegetable dealers who had to destroy their products. Some claims are still being contested. One Munich family has sued the Government to get back money it spent on a panic flight to New York in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. Not everybody lost. Frozen food sales soared in the months after Chernobyl and captured a new market that otherwise would have needed five years of publicity, according to industry estimates. One large Italian frozen-food firm reported that its sales went up 20 billion lire ($15.6 million) in the month after the accident. Probably the most potent legacy of Chernobyl, however, has been the impetus it gave to resistance against nuclear power. Green parties and organizations such as Greenpeace or Britain's Friends of the Earth all posted sharp increases in membership, and major political parties like West Germany's Social Democrats, came out against nuclear energy. The most dramatic result was in Sweden, where the fallout from Chernobyl bolstered already potent anti-nuclear sentiments and pushed the Government into a decision to actually phase out nuclear energy - which provides 42 percent of the country's electricity - by the year 2010. 'Not Happy About Nuclear Power' Nowhere else was the effect quite so drastic, but in many countries the long-term future of nuclear energy came under serious question. ''People just don't feel happy about nuclear power,'' said Jean Emergy, the campaign secretary of a British organization called Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment. ''They don't feel safe about it. It's not necessarily that people will now go out and protest about nuclear power plants already in place. I think that what people want to do is to stop it from expanding.'' In a Gallup poll taken in Britain last November, 20 percent of those surveyed thought nuclear power generation should be increased, 31 percent said it should be halted and 44 percent said it should stay the same. In Italy, the Chernobyl disaster was used as a chief issue in the opposition campaign for a referendum last November in which 70 percent of voters cast ballots for restrictions on nuclear energy. That prompted then-Prime Minister Giovanni Goria to declare a moratorium on nuclear power. The decision precipitated his downfall last March after work resumed on a nuclear power plant north of Rome. Ban Attempt in Germany In West Germany, four attempts have been made since Chernobyl to ban nuclear power, and a fifth is currently under way in Parliament, led by the opposition Social Democrats, who in August 1986 formally adopted the goal of eliminating nuclear energy by 1996. Though the attempt is likely to prove unsuccessful, it has focused public attention on the issue. Public opinion polls have shown growing resistance to nuclear power even in conservative ranks. In one recent poll, support for building more nuclear plants among members of the conservative Christian Democratic party dropped from 25 percent in 1984 to 15 percent last year. West Germany gets about a third of its electricity from nuclear power. Two new plants have come on line since the Chernobyl accident and three more are scheduled for completion by the end of next year, but there are no plans for future expansion. Elsewhere on the Continent the impact has varied from country to country. Yugoslavia, Switzerland and the Netherlands are among countries whose governments scrapped or postponed plans for new nuclear powers plants in the aftermath of Chernobyl. New Ministries Established At the same time, the two European countries most heavily dependent on nuclear energy, France and Belgium, have shown the fewest qualms about it. France gets 65 percent of its power from nuclear generators, and Belgium 60 percent. One permament effect of Chernobyl has been heightened preparedness for nuclear accidents. The West German Government, for example, set up a Ministry for the Environment, the Protection of Nature and Reactor Safety and charged it with preparing public recommendations in case of another disaster, while Italy established a Ministry for Ecological Affairs. The British Government is launching a system called Rimnet, or Radioactive Incident Monitoring Network, designed to provide data on contamination levels in the event of a nuclear accident overseas. Sophisticated new instruments enabled Sweden to monitor an increase in background radiation recently and to trace it to the Ignalina power plant in Lithuania, which has a reactor of the same type as Chernobyl's. Soviet officials have denied that there were any emissions from a Soviet plant.",1988-06-12T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world
3e377a37-3dbd-4934-b620-89c05ba0f3ae,http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFDA163DF932A35754C0A967958260,A Crisis of Confidence for Japan's Nuclear Power Strategy,"When Japan's industrial planners outlined their vision of the next two decades, they concluded last year that the country was more committed than ever to nuclear power. Only by building two nuclear plants a year for the next 20 years could Japan keep its auto factories humming, its electronics industry buzzing and its neon cities brightly lighted, they said. Now, despite a multimillion-dollar effort by the Government to win public acceptance, that strategy appears on the brink of collapse. An anti-nuclear movement that Japanese officials once dismissed as a radical fringe is gradually winning over the middle class, helped by disclosures about a nuclear accident four months ago here in the industrial heartland. So far, the Government investigation has uncovered dangerously sloppy construction work and a remarkable series of operational and maintenance mistakes, all casting severe doubt on its argument that nuclear power, in disciplined Japanese hands, is safer here than anywhere else in the world. The price of those mistakes may become evident in the next few months. With several of its biggest nuclear plants out of action -- the Mihama No. 2 plant was so badly damaged in the accident that it will not operate again for at least three years, and a similarly designed plant has been shut for emergency repairs -- Japan's demand for electric power in the humid, sticky summer is likely to come perilously close to its generating capacity. June has broken all electricity-demand records, and the Government has drawn up plans to do at a stroke, should things get worse, what legions of American and European trade negotiators have tried to do for years: slow the output of Japanese industry. Such a slowing took place in Tokyo last summer, and many predict this year could be worse. Pamphlets urging conservation are already being distributed to more than 20 million households. ""They realize that they are beginning to run into real troubles, immediately and in the long term,"" Daniel Yergin, the head of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said on a recent visit to Tokyo. How Japan navigates its power crisis this summer and over the next few years may be the greatest test yet of its much-admired skills at creating, conserving and bargaining for enough energy to keep a huge but resource-poor economy growing at rates that have consistently outpaced those in the West. Indeed, the rate of economic growth is Japan's biggest energy challenge. In the last few years, energy demand has increased at roughly twice the 2.5 percent annual pace that the Government projected when it laid out its plans for building nuclear power plants. ""The reality is that even if we built all of our new nuclear plants, it would not be enough,"" a senior official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said recently. ""We underestimated how quickly the demand would grow."" Projects Being Refused Hopes of finding communities willing to take new nuclear power stations are also quickly fading. Cash and big public works projects, which always attracted takers when Japan embarked on huge power projects in the 1960's, are now being refused. ""Japan is rich now, and people aren't interested in getting compensation,"" Shinichi Nakagawa, an executive of Kansai Electric Power, Japan's second-largest utility and the operator of the crippled Mihama plant, said recently. The country's energy troubles are compounded by a series of environmental controls adopted by the Government of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in recent months. The new rules set emission controls for carbon dioxide that will sharply limit the number of oil- and coal-fired power plants that Japan can build. Hardly Dead The nuclear industry is hardly dead here: a huge nuclear-fuel reprocessing operation and 11 nuclear power plants are under construction, mostly on the sites of existing plants where there is no need for local approval. In comparison, there are five plants under construction in the United States. Japan spends nearly $1 billion a year on nuclear energy research, three times more than American industry, and these days it is often outpacing its teacher. But the political realities in Japan are quickly changing, and nowhere is the change more evident than in downtown Osaka. Street protests are relatively rare in Japan. Yet, since March, soon after the Mihama accident, anti-nuclear activists have lived in a tent city across the street from the headquarters of Kansai Electric. Protestors have recently bought stock in the major utilities, and at raucous shareholder meetings this week they forced clearly unhappy corporate managers to discuss nuclear questions in public. Still Aiming for 40 New Plants ""I don't think that we are having any effect on the operation of existing plants,"" Daisuke Sato, an official of Osaka prefecture who has joined the protestors in the tent city, said the other day. ""But as far as new plants are concerned, I think they will never go ahead."" Government officials, utility executives and Japan's three big nuclear power builders -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Hitachi Ltd. and the Toshiba Corporation -- disagree, saying that the goal of 40 new plants, while difficult, is not impossible. But a poll of 2,500 Japanese conducted by Kansai Electric last year, before the Mihama accident, showed that while roughly two-thirds of the population thought nuclear power was necessary, only one-third thought it was safe or would consent to the construction of a plant near their house. A Government poll last fall found that 47 percent of the population thought that Japanese-made nuclear power plants were ""relatively unsafe"" or ""not safe at all."" ""We are almost scared to take the poll again this year,"" a senior Government official said a few months ago. Members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, once staunch supporters of nuclear power, are often reluctant to appear decidedly pro-nuclear in local elections. Still, until Mihama, Japanese plants had been the envy of the industry: on average they suffer far fewer unplanned shutdowns than plants in the United States or in France, and workers are generally considered better trained. Though the Mihama accident was considered relatively mild because the amount of radiactive material released into the air was small, the investigation found that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which built the reactor, made a series of major errors and then tried to cover them up. The accident occurred when a tube that carries superheated radioactive water from the nuclear core into the plant's steam generator broke, contaminating the clean steam that turns the electric generators. The resulting leak led to a dangerous reduction in the amount of water cooling the nuclear fuel, and emergency systems had to be used to prevent a meltdown. An investigation showed that the pipe broke because it -- and many pipes around it -- had never been connected to an anti-vibration bar that was intended to support it. The error was traced to workers who, frustrated that the bar would not fit correctly, simply jammed it in and cut off the ends so that inspectors would be unable to detect the short-cut. 'Intentionally Sloppy Work' ""Maybe Mitsubishi did not know how important these bars were,"" said Mr. Nakagawa of Kansai Electric. ""It was intentionally sloppy work."" Investigators also found that Kansai had failed to conduct proper maintenance on emergency pressure valves, several of which failed as workers scrambled to bring the plant under control. The cost of replacing the steam generators will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Kansai Electric, realizing that its hopes of finding sites for several new nuclear power stations are doomed, is getting ready to build a new plant powered by liquefied natural gas. Other utilities are turning to similar non-nuclear options. The nuclear industry is hoping that political changes in Japan -- chiefly the diminished power of the Socialist Party, one of its biggest critics -- will allow it to pursue its plans for more nuclear power. But that hope is slim, and for now the Government appears paralyzed, unable to abandon its earlier targets or to devise an environmentally acceptable alternative.",1991-07-01T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business
3c69deab-a6e8-454e-83dc-f310b22f92d2,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/08/business/global/08nuke.html,Wide Support for Stricter Nuclear Oversight,"PARIS — International energy ministers and officials of nuclear agencies pledged support Tuesday for a global push to improve safety tests at nuclear power plants. The pledge emerged from a meeting in Paris that also highlighted divergent national approaches to the sector following the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan. The meeting, described as an “informal seminar,” was suggested by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France at a Group of 8 leaders’ meeting last month. Mr. Sarkozy has proposed drafting new global standards for nuclear security and updating international conventions in the wake of the accident that struck the reactors in Japan after the earthquake and tsunami March 11. “It quickly become apparent that we need to draw conclusions from the accident and improve and lift our standards and cooperation on nuclear safety,” said Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, the French ecology minister, who led the meeting. Representatives attended from around 30 countries drawn from the G-8 and members of the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. According to a statement released afterward, there was a consensus that countries with nuclear facilities should carry out stress tests and periodic safety reviews and that the role and missions of the International Atomic Energy Agency should be bolstered. Attendees also discussed how to develop international nuclear intervention teams and possible modifications to existing international conventions, including those concerning liability. The talks will continue among ministers at an I.A.E.A. meeting in Vienna on June 20-24, a gathering expected to propose more concrete steps, possibly including mandatory international safety regulations going beyond the agency’s existing recommendations. Among those represented Tuesday were leading nuclear energy producers like France, which has 58 reactors providing around 80 percent of its electricity. Other attendees were Germany and Switzerland, which are abandoning their programs, and India, which is turning to the sector to sate its growing energy needs. “There was no debate on whether to abandon nuclear or to start a program,” Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet said. “There was a general, uncontested agreement from everyone at the meeting that nuclear safety must come first — whether it’s a question of more or less nuclear power. And that depends on international cooperation.” One European country wavering on the question is Italy, where the Constitutional Court ruled Tuesday that a referendum on restarting nuclear power projects could proceed Sunday, the ANSA news agency reported. The Italian public voted to reject nuclear energy after the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine in 1986. The Swiss government decided in May to phase out nuclear energy by 2034. “We think that it’s firstly very important that all states with nuclear plants put in place the existing nuclear safety requirements,” the Swiss federal energy minister, Doris Leuthard, said. “Then we think peer reviews are very helpful.” “We would love, from the Swiss government, that these peer reviews are not only on a voluntary basis, that people would accept it would be mandatory,” she said. “Why don’t we give transparency to our populations.” Ursula Heinen-Esser, a state secretary at the Federal Environment Ministry of Germany, another country that is turning away from nuclear power, said the immediate priority should be stress tests. She added that Berlin welcomed the G-8’s call for those countries that have not started such tests to carry them out. Srikumar Banerjee, the chairman of India’s Atomic Energy Commission, said his country had little choice but to turn to nuclear power, given that its energy demand is growing 10 percent or more a year. “This power demand is so genuine,” he said, “the only alternative is that we burn coal.” He said that India currently contributed 5 percent of global carbon emissions, but that would rise to 50 percent if it met its energy needs from coal. New Delhi, he added, was investing in solar energy, “but it cannot sustain a metropolis or a heavy industry.” Milan Hovorka, the Czech Republic’s deputy minister for industry and trade, said the meeting highlighted “some minor differences here and there regarding the measures to be taken and sequences,” but he added, “I belive that we are united and that we are determined to proceed with a view to bringing the issue of nuclear safety to the highest possible level.” Hideichi Okada, Japan’s deputy minister for international affairs at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, said Tokyo had been “as transparent as possible” in releasing data on radiation since the accident. “As soon as we get the information, we disseminate.” On Monday, the Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said that radioactive emissions from the Fukushima plant might have been more than twice as large as a previous estimate. Luis E. Echávarri, director general of the Nuclear Energy Agency at the O.E.C.D., said the Fukushima accident was not a result of bad design or operation but had “shown the weaknesses of nuclear power plants” in facing unforeseen external events like natural disasters. “We have realized still we can improve significantly nuclear designs and this is what is being done,” he said. On Wednesday, the heads of the nuclear regulatory agencies “will continue the discussion to join the political view with the technical and regulatory view,” Mr. Echávarri said, seeking to coordinate safety reviews under way and “draw lessons to apply to all power plants.”",2011-06-07T22:13:07.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-global-business

The National Cancer Institute said today that a nationwide study had found no increased risk of death from cancer for people living near nuclear power plants or other nuclear installations. The institute surveyed 107 counties that have such installations or adjoin counties that do. It found that some counties had higher cancer death rates than counties without nuclear plants while others had lower rates. ''From the data at hand, there was no convincing evidence of any increased risk of death from any of the cancers we surveyed due to living near nuclear facilities,'' said John Boice, chief of the cancer institute's Radiation Epidemiology Branch. But Mr. Boice added that the size of the counties might have been too large to detect cancer risk to people living immediately around nuclear plants. ''No study can prove the absence of an effect,'' he said in a statement. Hope of Easing Anxiety Advocates of reviving the deeply depressed nuclear power industry said the study should help their efforts by easing public anxiety over the health effects of nuclear power. But opponents of nuclear power said that the study was flawed and inconclusive and that there were many other serious problems that made a revival of the nuclear power industry highly unlikely. Michael T. Rossler, nuclear programs director of the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association of the private electric utility industry, said: ''The study is helpful. It shows there is not a problem to individuals, that there is not a danger from radiation.'' But he added that he was not sure this one report would resuscitate the nuclear power industry because the industry faced other serious problems involving economics and regulatory procedures. Study 'Dilutes' the Risk Steven W. Unglesbee, a spokesman for the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, a lobbying group that represents the commercial nuclear energy industry, noted that the cancer institute's report ''comes at a time when energy is definitely high on the national agenda, when environmental concerns are high on the national agenda and there is a growing need for electrical capacity for the coming decade.'' But Daryl Kimball, associate director for policy of Physicians for Social Responsibility, a national organization of medical professionals concerned with nuclear war and other dangers from nuclear power, said the study ''raises more questions than it answers.'' Mr. Kimball said the study diluted the risks of exposure to radiation from nuclear plants by examining entire counties instead of areas where people were directly exposed to radiation. He cited the Fernald weapons plant near Cincinnati, where over 500,000 pounds of uranium were released into the atmosphere. This uranium may have fallen on only a small area, he said, but the study includes all the people in the surrounding counties. ''This report does not dispel the doubts and concerns that the medical community has had about the nuclear industry for the past several decades,'' Mr. Kimball said. ''More research is necessary before we will be able to determine what the effects are from low-level radiation.'' Other Fears Voiced Robert Pollard, a nuclear safety engineer with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said most opposition to nuclear power came not because of fears of low-level radiation but because of the fear of a catastrophe caused by an accident at a nuclear plant. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in a statements that the study would reassure people living ''in the shadow of nuclear plants, many of whom might well have feared the worst.'' But he added that the survey dealt only with cancer deaths, not people who contracted cancer or other diseases, adding, ''It is not a clean bill of health for the nuclear industry.'' The institute survey was conducted by Seymour Jablon, Dr. Zdenek Hrubec, Dr. B. J. Stone and Dr. Boice. It was started in 1987 in response to concerns in this country about the effects of radiation and after a British study of cancer deaths around nuclear facilities found elevated levels of childhood leukemia deaths. The cancer institute's study did not find high levels of mortality from childhood leukemia in this country. #16 Kinds of Cancer Studied The scientists studied more than 900,000 cancer deaths from 1950 to 1984 in counties containing or adjacent to 62 nuclear installations. These included 52 commercial nuclear power plants, 9 Department of Energy research and weapons plants, and one commercial fuel reprocessing plant. It examined 16 kinds of cancer, including leukemia. In a telephone interview, Dr. Boice agreed with critics who said the survey did not provide the final word on risks from nuclear plants. ''The study is limited, no question about it,'' he said, noting that it was based only on cancer deaths, not incidences of cancer. He added that it was not clear how many people might have moved away from the surveyed areas and then died of cancer. On the other hand, he said, ''the study can provide very useful baseline data to help investigators do intense studies,'' like one now under way to examine the effects of radiation around the weapons plant in Hanford, Wash. This year the Energy Department acknowledged that radiation produced by the plant in the 1940's and 1950's was high enough to cause illnesses, including cancer, in residents of the Pacific Northwest. A study is underway to determine how many illness were caused by the radiation.",1990-09-20T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

The statement about the reactors came in Mr. Abe’s first televised interview since taking office. During his five days as prime minister, he had hinted that he would take a closer look at nuclear power. “They will be completely different from those at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant,” he told the national television network TBS. Multiple meltdowns at the plant after an earthquake last year forced more than 100,000 people to flee their homes. “With public understanding, we will be building anew,” Mr. Abe said. He did not specify where or when. Building nuclear power plants would depart from the direction of the previous government of Yoshihiko Noda, who had pledged to phase out nuclear power by 2040. It also appeared to go against a campaign platform adopted by Mr. Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party that aims “to establish an economy and society that does not need to rely on nuclear power.” The platform also said Japan would put the development of alternative energy sources, like solar and wind, ahead of nuclear power, and made no mention of new nuclear plants. Though fervent antinuclear protests across the country have kept all but two of Japan’s 50 reactors off line, Mr. Abe is betting that Japan’s silent majority will condone a return to nuclear to help bolster the economy. Mr. Abe’s pro-business Liberal Democrats won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections this month, campaigning on promises to take bolder measures to kick-start Japan’s moribund economy. The nation’s biggest business lobby, the Keidanren, has publicly urged the government to restart the nation’s reactors. Signaling what could be rocky relations with Tokyo’s neighbors, Mr. Abe, who returned as a prime minister after a yearlong stint in 2006-7, also hinted that he may replace or void apologies from 1993  and 1995 for Japan’s having used women as sex slaves during World War II and for past colonial rule and aggression in Asia. In a separate interview with The Sankei Shimbun, a national daily, he said his previous administration had found no evidence that the women who served as sex slaves to Japan’s wartime military had, in fact, been coerced. The Japanese government will seek to communicate that view, the newspaper quoted Mr. Abe as saying. A perceived lack of remorse by Japan for its colonial and wartime history has been severely criticized, especially by South Korea and China, which bore the brunt of Japan’s colonial aggressions. Japan is already embroiled in territorial spats with the two nations, heightening tensions over the past year.",2012-12-31T06:44:45.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

It has blown a big hole in Japan’s energy policy, which had assumed that nuclear power would supply a growing part of the country’s needs. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Naoto Kan said Japan  would  abandon plans to build new nuclear reactors , saying at a news conference in Tokyo that Japan needed to “start from  scratch” on its long-term energy policy. Japanese officials had said over the weekend that Japan would not abandon nuclear power as an important source of energy, so many existing reactors are expected to keep operating. However, experts have been saying that it would now be difficult for Japan to further expand use of nuclear energy and realize a policy that predates the Fukushima disaster: construction of at least 14 new reactors by 2030 to go with the 54 that now exist. If completed, those reactors would have raised nuclear power’s share of Japan’s electricity generation to about 50 percent. Advocates for renewable energy argue that the March earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident have given the nation a reason to rebuild its economy as a world leader in clean, renewable energy — even though solar, wind and geothermal combined now account for only 1 percent of Japan’s electricity. An additional 8 percent or so comes from hydroelectric power. “It is a battle between the future and the past,” said Tetsunari Iida, executive director of the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies, a nonprofit policy research organization here. Some members of Parliament recently held a forum, called Energy Shift Japan, to promote a move toward renewable sources. And Masayoshi Son, the founder of Softbank and Japan’s richest man, said last month that he would donate about $12 million to start a research foundation for renewable energy. Continued reliance on atomic energy, he told a news conference, “would be a sin against our children, grandchildren and future generations.” Those more attuned to the official government position, however, contend that renewable energy is too costly and requires too much land in this crowded country, leaving Japan little choice but to continue hitching its future to atomic energy, with fossil fuels filling any gap. “In the midterm, up to 2030, we cannot see the technological breakthrough that will allow us to get rid of nuclear power,” said Masakazu Toyoda, chief executive of the Institute of Energy Economics, Japan. Even so, the future of the envisioned 14 reactors being planned is now unclear, with the public and local officials becoming more wary about living near such facilities. Already, the Tokyo Electric Power Company has been forced to drop plans to build two new reactors on the site of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant. And just last Friday, the government requested that another utility , Chubu Electric Power, shut down a nuclear power plant 120 miles southwest of Tokyo until the company can fortify its earthquake and tsunami defenses. The company said on Monday that it would comply with that request. So many reactors have been shut down because of the earthquake or other factors, that soon only about 43 percent of Japan’s 49 gigawatts of nuclear capacity will be operational, according to Reuters. Japan’s heavy dependence on nuclear power stems from its energy insecurity. With virtually no oil and natural gas of its own, it is almost totally reliant on imported fossil fuels, making the nation vulnerable to disruptions, for example any that might arise from unrest in the Middle East. And the cost of imported fossil fuels has risen from the equivalent of 1 percent of Japan’s gross domestic product in 1998 to almost 5 percent now. Japan also imports uranium. But because the fuel is easier to stockpile than oil and gas, the government considers nuclear energy a quasi-domestic source. Atomic energy, to the extent it replaces fossil fuels, also reduces greenhouse gas emissions and is a little less expensive than energy from fossil fuels, according to the government. Over the decades, nuclear power has been fostered by a close alliance between the government, electric companies and reactor manufacturers. Nuclear plants, as large, centralized sources of power, have helped Japan’s 10 main electric utilities maintain their control over the power grid. The advent of a so-called smart grid that would handle power supplied by numerous small producers could threaten the utilities’ dominance. “What they want to do as much as possible is to keep distributed power off the agenda,” said Andrew DeWit, an expert on Japan’s energy policy at Rikkyo University. While others beside the electric companies can generate electricity, so far this has not caught on in a big way. Now, though, some are calling for more competition in power production in an effort to spur innovation and bring down prices. The government and power companies have not totally ignored renewable energy, but critics say they have not been aggressive enough. Over all, Ernst & Young ranks Japan 15th in the world in terms of attractiveness of its renewable energy markets and policies. In 2002, the Japanese government mandated that by 2014, electric companies should produce about 1.6 percent of their electricity from renewable sources. That target did not include large hydroelectric power projects, for which many of the best opportunities have already been exploited. Some regulators elsewhere are pursuing renewable energy more aggressively than Japan is. California, for instance, recently set a renewable-source goal for its electric companies of 20 percent by end of 2013 and 33 percent by the end of 2020. Until 2004, Japan led the world in installation of solar photovoltaic cells. Japanese companies like Sharp and Sanyo are among the world’s largest manufacturers of solar panels. But since then Germany and Spain, which offer higher subsidies to users, have raced ahead in the installation of solar panels. Japan has made even less progress on wind energy. Some experts say Japan, which has little flat land, is not that well suited for wind power, although the Environment Ministry said recently that there was a huge potential in the northern part of the country. But renewables could get a lift if Parliament, as expected, enacts a law requiring electric companies to buy electricity generated by wind, geothermal, biomass or small-scale hydroelectric power from those who produce it, paying premium prices to subsidize the providers’ costs. The system, known as a feed-in tariff, was started in late 2009 for solar energy produced by homeowners and businesses. The utilities pass the costs on to all their customers, raising electric bills slightly. Mr. Iida of the sustainable energy institute said that it would be feasible for renewable energy to provide 30 percent of Japan’s electricity by 2020, with solar and wind each contributing about 7 to 8 percent, and hydroelectric providing most of the rest. But Paul J. Scalise, an expert on Japan’s energy policy at Temple University’s Japan campus, said renewable energy was “simply uneconomical at the present time.” Wind and solar would also not provide the dependable electricity that Japanese industry needs, he said. He said it cost Tokyo Electric 30.5 yen per kilowatt hour for renewable energy, compared with 9.1 yen for power from fossil fuels and 6.1 yen for nuclear power. With nuclear plans now up in the air, Mr. Scalise said, electric companies “are not turning to renewables — they are turning to oil and gas again.” For instance, a Japanese consortium led by the trading company Itochu is considering building a plant in Vladivostok, Russia, to produce liquefied natural gas for shipment to Japan. Still, the cost of renewable energy is declining as technology improves, while that of nuclear power is likely to rise after the accident because of stricter safety standards and higher liability insurance costs. It is not clear if there is the political will to change the reliance on nuclear. In a nationwide telephone survey conducted in mid-April by the Asahi Shimbun, a leading Japanese newspaper, 41 percent said nuclear energy should be reduced or abandoned, up from 28 percent in 2007. And yet, 51 percent of respondents said the existing level of nuclear power should be retained, while 5 percent said it should increase. One thing most experts agree on is that conservation should be a priority. Cutting power use 10 percent would be the equivalent of building about 13 reactors, said Mr. Toyoda of the energy economics institute. The nation is likely to get a real-life conservation test in the coming months. Because of the nuclear and fossil fuel power plants knocked out by the earthquake and tsunami, businesses and households in some parts of the country will be asked to cut their peak energy use this summer by about 15 percent.",2011-05-10T01:47:06.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

The last nuclear plant order was placed in 1978, the year before the accident at Three Mile Island terrified the public and sent chills up the spines of utility executives who suddenly realized how easily a multibillion-dollar plant might be wiped out. But now, in an effort to revive itself, the nuclear power industry has issued a ""strategic plan"" designed to encourage the ordering of new plants by the mid-1990's, with the first to start operating by the turn of the century. The plan is both optimistic and limited but well worth pursuing. The need for the nuclear power option has been growing with every new woe that strikes fossil fuels. Coal, the chief source of electricity, will rise in cost and unacceptability as the new Clean Air Act clamps down. And the Persian Gulf crisis has underscored the vulnerability of oil supplies. Although most electric utilities have largely weaned themselves from foreign oil, some 6 percent of the electricity in this country is still generated by burning oil -- and the amount is rising. Judicious use of nuclear plants could halt that trend. More important in the long run, the threat of global warming, while far from proven, casts an ever-darker shadow over the prospects for burning coal, oil or natural gas. All such fossil fuels emit carbon dioxide, a ""greenhouse gas"" which traps heat in the atmosphere and might eventually cause a disastrous rise in global temperatures. Nuclear power plants emit no carbon dioxide. Thus the plan issued last week by a committee of nuclear and utility executives is a welcome step toward keeping the nuclear option available. The plan envisages using new types of reactors -- now being built abroad with participation by American companies -- that are evolutionary improvements over existing light-water reactors. These are supposedly 10 times safer, but still fall far short of the ""inherently safe"" designs sought by nuclear critics. The plan also calls for standardized nuclear plants, to improve the predictability of costs and building schedules and to reduce the regulatory burden imposed by custom-built plants. And it proposes streamlining the regulatory process and making it easier for new plants to obtain funding. Most of the steps seem reasonable and many are already under way. But the plan focuses primarily on procedural or institutional changes. It does not solve the more important substantive issues that have turned the public away from nuclear power. Until the industry shows that its plants can be operated with a near-perfect safety record, that radioactive waste can be disposed of and that financial risks can be brought under control, nuclear power in this country will continue to languish.",1990-11-18T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,opinion

The devastation in northeastern Japan is so horrific that it seems surreal. The Japanese may never know how many people died in this horrible earthquake and tsunami, and the cost of this disaster will likely be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. The release of radioactive material from the damaged nuclear plants will certainly cause more deaths and disease, and radiation being blown out into the Pacific Ocean may become a threat to the Hawaiian Islands and the West Coast of the United States. While Japan may have been the best prepared nation to deal with a large-scale earthquake, there is no way any country could prepare for and deal with an 8.9-magnitude earthquake. This earthquake should serve as a cautionary tale for us here in America. With our overpowering need for new sources of clean, sustainable energy, we should not rush headlong into building more and bigger nuclear power plants, unless we are prepared to build them to withstand the strongest devastating events Mother Nature can hurl at us. Henry A. Lowenstein New York, March 14, 2011  To the Editor: Re “ U.S. Nuclear Push May Be in Peril ” (front page, March 14): The explosion at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant should sober those who tout nuclear power as a solution to global warming. Nuclear power is vulnerable at many points in the fuel cycle, from the risk of reactor meltdown to the theft of radioactive materials for terrorism or proliferation. It requires safely storing nuclear waste for thousands of years. Plants are vulnerable to both storm and drought. Meanwhile, global warming brings both of these — and social chaos. As we enter such a world, technologies too dangerous to fail are too dangerous to pursue. David Keppel Bloomington, Ind., March 14, 2011  To the Editor: Re “ Crisis at Pair of Reactors Underscores Japan’s Fear of the Nuclear Industry ” (news article, March 13): While obviously the first concern that the international community has about the disaster in Japan is the dreadful loss of lives and the damage to property, the nuclear industry has to be troubled by the possible fallout from the partial meltdowns at nuclear plants in that nation. For Japan, nuclear plants have been a two-edged sword. With few oil deposits and a dwindling amount of coal, Japan has had little alternative but to use nuclear power, despite the risk of earthquakes in a region prone to them. Certainly any nuclear disaster will recall the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. Unfortunately for the international nuclear power industry, the tragedy in Japan may reduce the call for dependence on that energy source, driving the price of oil and coal ever higher. The Three Mile Island incident and the disaster at Chernobyl delayed the use of nuclear power as an alternative energy source. Nelson Marans Silver Spring, Md., March 14, 2011  To the Editor: A lesson should be learned from the tragedy in Japan and the radiation leaks from the nuclear power plants. These plants should not be located near major population centers. Nearly 10 million people live within 25 miles of the Indian Point nuclear power plant in Buchanan, N.Y., north of New York City. This plant, like the power plants in Japan, is situated on an earthquake fault. Although the New York area is not as likely to have as significant an earthquake as the one in Japan, the risks are severe because of Indian Point’s proximity to so many people. If Japan was unable to prevent nuclear power accidents after an earthquake, can Entergy, the owner of Indian Point, do a better job of protecting its neighbors? Paul Feiner Greenburgh, N.Y., March 14, 2011 The writer is town supervisor of the Town of Greenburgh.  To the Editor: Re “ The Best-Laid Plans ” (Week in Review, March 13): For those in the United States who have been in denial about our aging infrastructure, the terrible earthquake and tsunami in Japan should finally convince them that we need to raise the public funds to bring our roads, bridges, public buildings, water and sewer systems, schools, trains and broadband networks up to 21st-century standards. The only way we can accomplish this is by raising taxes on the wealthy and ensuring that corporations pay their fair share of taxes. Besides the benefit of improved structures, these projects would create jobs and strengthen the economy, recreating the growth of the post-World War II decades.

This charge, citing an academic survey that has been widely circulated by the nuclear industry, misleads not only on our position on nuclear power, but about the nature of scientific dissent. There are many thousands of scientists who support our work on reactor safety. We don't doubt that many, if not most, scientists say the U.S. should expand its use of nuclear power. That does not mean, however, that nuclear power is their first choice for new sources of electricity. Nor does it mean they endorse sloppy construction and dilatory management of nuclear plants. Reactors could be made safe, but safety has been seriously compromised by government and industry. We believe there are other ways to produce energy - or to make energy use more efficient - that do not incur the costs and risks of the nuclear-fuel cycle. Our views, we are confident, are supported by a significant minority - if not a majority - of knowledgeable scientists and engineers. Second, the mission of the Union of Concerned Scientists is not to win the affections of a majority of scientists. Our role is to explore technology critically, to give independent advice to citizens and policy makers, which, we hope, will lead to enhancements of safety and security. In nuclear power, our technical analyses over the last 14 years have led to many improvements in the safety of reactors.

Mr. Kessel was part of an intervener group who saw political opportunity in Lilco's Shoreham problems. Playing on ignorance and fear and knowing that Freeport, Rockville Centre and Greenport were getting Niagara Falls power virtually free they coined the slogan ""Power Cheap as Freeport"" and proceeded to obstruct the Shoreham licensing. The State Public Service Commission held long hearings and estimated the cost of Lilco mismanagement and the cost of intervener obstruction. Lilco shareholders were assessed for mismanagement and the rate payers assessed with interveners' obstruction, and the rate base that is used to calculate the electric bill was adjusted accordingly. Shoreham's ultimate cost was $5.5 billion, almost half of Lilco's total capitalization. Shoreham produced no power for consumers or income to Lilco in the decadeslong battle. Construction and licensing money was borrowed, Lilco's credit rating was lowered to speculation, as costs ballooned. Interest alone -- above 10 percent at the time -- was $1.25 million a day. Dividends were discontinued, and share prices dropped, from $35 to $6. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo made an agreement with Lilco that reflected the cost of intervenor obstruction, and the electric bill soared. The 110 nuclear-power plants on line in the United States today have never caused an injury to the public or released harmful quantities of radiation. Generation of nuclear electric power is the safest industry in the country. Electric utilities routinely report that nuclear facilities deliver the lowest cost of their mix of generation sources. Shoreham was a safe licensed nuclear-power plant ready to deliver power. The Fitzpatrick Nuclear Power Plant upstate New York has been delivering low-cost electric power to Long Island for decades, and Shoreham, without the cost of obstruction, would have been a low-cost producer, too. Lilco ratepayers are paying for a useless Shoreham plant, the cost of dismantling it, the cost of Mr. Kessel's obstruction and purchasing expensive gas-turbine electric power, in addition to the cost of electricity produced by Lilco. Richard M. Kessel, an architect of the Shoreham obstruction, belongs to that group of Neanderthals who picketed their cave dwellings protesting the introduction of fire into the cave. His progenitors shouted slogans such as, ""Fire is the work of evil spirits,"" ""Cooked food is bad for your health,"" ""Fire smokes up the cave"" and ""You'll burn up the forest.""

Their numbers are still small, but they represent growing cracks in what had been a virtually solid wall of opposition to nuclear power among most mainstream environmental groups. In the past few months, articles in publications like Technology Review, published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Wired magazine have openly espoused nuclear power, angering other environmental advocates. Stewart Brand, a founder of the Whole Earth Catalog and the author of ''Environmental Heresies,'' an article in the May issue of Technology Review, explained the shift as a direct consequence of the growing anxiety about global warming and its links to the use of fossil fuel. ''It's not that something new and important and good had happened with nuclear, it's that something new and important and bad has happened with climate change,'' Mr. Brand said in an interview. For many longtime advocates of environmental causes, such talk is nothing short of betrayal. Because of safety fears that reached a peak during the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 and unresolved questions of how to dispose of nuclear waste, environmentalists have waged unrelenting campaigns against plants from Shoreham on Long Island to Diablo Canyon near the California coast. But as mounting scientific evidence points to a direct connection between increasing carbon emissions and climate change, Mr. Brand and others have come to see conventional fuels like oil and coal as a greater threat. In his article, Mr. Brand argued, ''Everything must be done to increase energy efficiency and decarbonize energy production.'' He ran down a list of alternative technologies, like solar and wind energy, that emit no heat-trapping gases. ''But add them all up,'' he wrote, ''and it's just a fraction of enough.'' His conclusion: ''The only technology ready to fill the gap and stop the carbon-dioxide loading is nuclear power.'' In recent statements, three top environmental experts -- Fred Krupp, the executive director of Environmental Defense, and Jonathan Lash, the president of the World Resources Institute and James Gustave Speth, the dean of Yale's School of Forestry and Environmental Studies -- have stopped well short of embracing nuclear power, but they have emphasized that it is worth trying to find solutions to the economic, safety and security, waste storage and proliferation issues rather than rejecting the whole technology. These efforts to edge away from the established orthodoxy coincide with moves by Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, to offer significant financial incentives for the development of three new nuclear technologies --each with its own corporate backer -- as part of a bill he and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, are sponsoring to regulate emissions of heat-trapping gases. ''We've got to go to all alternate forms of energy, nuclear power,'' Mr. McCain told Don Imus during an appearance on his MSNBC show Friday morning. The addition to the McCain-Lieberman bill, which is being circulated in draft form, would codify a new political bargain. Conservatives would support emission controls in return for liberal support for a new generation of nuclear power plants, a shift that could reshape the existing alignments on these issues. Details of the proposed new language in the McCain-Lieberman bill, some of which were first reported in The Energy Daily, a trade publication, were provided by a person who had read a draft. He requested anonymity because no final decision on the measure has been made. Those environmentalists who are newly outspoken in favor of nuclear power lace their views with qualifiers. Mr. Krupp of Environmental Defense said in an interview, ''There are still very serious questions that have not been answered and E.D. is not going to be supporting nuclear power until we get good answers.'' But, he added, ''We are taking a fresh look and we want to pursue the answers, get the answers, because the global warming problem is so serious.'' Mr. Speth of Yale, the author of ''Red Sky at Morning,'' a book painting global warming as a crisis, said in an interview that if there were a national program to control the emission of heat-trapping gases, ''I think we would want nuclear to be one of the technologies that is out there, competing on a level playing field with the others.'' The changing attitudes are roiling established environmental groups and provoking fierce internal arguments in the United States and in Europe. In this country, some groups used antinuclear campaigns to build membership, financial support and often their fundamental identities back in the 1970's, when Birkenstocks were new and the folksinger Arlo Guthrie was celebrating the antinuclear Clamshell Alliance. The release of radioactivity at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and the catastrophic explosion at Chernobyl in 1986 brought a halt to any thought of expanding nuclear technology in the United States. Now, groups like Greenpeace U.S.A., the Sierra Club, the World Wildlife Fund and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group argue with one voice that any more time or money spent on nuclear energy would unjustifiably divert resources from more promising solutions, like conservation and renewable energy. It has been 32 years since the last nuclear reactor was ordered and built in the United States, and 1996 was the last year in which a civilian nuclear reactor -- the Tennessee Valley Authority's Watts Bar reactor -- was commissioned. Nuclear reactors, almost all of them the first generation of this technology, now provide about 20 percent of electric power in the United States. Aside from the environmental issues, it is still far from clear when the fundamental economics of energy generation would favor the construction of new nuclear plants in the United States. Officials of electric company officials and those of companies that design and build reactors have said recently that without substantial government help, the costs of winning regulatory approval and building nuclear plants would be dauntingly high for investors. The proposals that Senator McCain is considering would provide a 50-50 cost-sharing arrangement, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies, to gain federal certification for three new designs for nuclear plants. On Monday he met with Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chairman and chief executive of General Electric, which constructs nuclear plants. Such subsidies are still anathema to most environmental groups, which believe that the nuclear industry got far more than its fair share of government aid in the last generation, while their technologies of choice were left hungry. ''The notion out there from some of these deep thinkers is that we have to take our medicine and if only we could accept nukes, the global warming problem would be solved,'' said Anna Aurilio, the legislative director at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. ''We have a whole bunch of solutions already that are not as risky.'' These include, Ms. Aurilio said, increasing national energy efficiency and investing in solar, wind, geothermal and biomass energy, like ethanol. Thomas B. Cochran, the director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's nuclear program said: ''The issue isn't: Do you support nuclear? The issue should be: Do you support massive subsidies to the tune of billions of dollars for nuclear power?'' He said, ''The answer is no.'' The most frequent objection to nuclear reactors is that they may lead to the spread of nuclear weapons. In an era when hostile or potentially hostile governments like those in North Korea and Iran are gaining proficiency in nuclear weapons technology, opponents ask, why support a technology that would generate more weapons-grade fuel? They also balk at the notion that nuclear waste can be safely and economically stored. The anger at the magazine articles advocating nuclear power was visceral. In the April edition of Wired, the editors wrote: ''In February, we suggested it's time to reconsider nuclear power; readers had a meltdown.'' They said, ''Even onetime environmentalist-in-chief Al Gore chimed in at Davos, complaining directly to our editor in chief.'' One letter to the magazine called the article -- ''Nuclear Now!'' by Peter Schwartz and Spencer Reiss -- ''right-leaning, Cheney-worshipping drivel about clean nuclear power'' and said, ''The bottom line is that nuclear power is inherently dangerous, and we have no way of disposing of the intensely radioactive trash it generates.'' Mr. Brand, the author of the Technology Review article, believes that these arguments will, if anything, get more intense. After ''decades of getting a message out and getting a degree of alignment'' he said, ''it's hard to reverse the polarity on this.'' Jerry Slominski, a lobbyist for the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade group for manufacturers, has yet to see much movement in the core constituencies of environmental groups. ''I think there's a lot of talk, but I haven't seen a real shifting in policy among environmental groups,'' Mr. Slominski said. ''They just don't know how to get from here to there, I think.'' But Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, disagreed. ''I do think that things are changing,'' Ms. Claussen said. ''I think people in the environmental community are getting more realistic about what is possible and what is not. At the same time, they are getting more panicky, maybe, about what you have to do to deal with climate change.''",2005-05-15T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,national-desk

At the end of 1985, the Soviet Union had a generating capacity of 28,000 megawatts in civilian nuclear utilities, and nuclear power generation last year was 170 billion kilowatt-hours, or 11 percent of the nation's total. This placed the Soviet Union in third place in nuclear generation, behind the United States and France. The 12th five-year plan, which began this year, continues to provide for more nuclear plants, mainly in the industrial, densely populated western regions, where fossil-fuel sources are diminishing. Over the five years, 41,000 megawatts is to be added. If fulfilled, the plan would raise nuclear generation to 390 billion kilowatt-hours by 1990, or 20 percent of total power output. The Chernobyl station in the Ukraine, where the accident announced today occurred, is one of the largest and oldest in the Soviet Union, with a designed capacity of 6,000 megawatts to be achieved by 1990. At the end of 1985, four reactors of 1,000 megawatts each were in operation, giving the Chernobyl station alone one-seventh of total Soviet nuclear generating capacity. The No. 5 Chernobyl reactor was to go into service this year. New Town Arose With Plant The nuclear station is near the town of Pripyat, which arose together with the plant to house construction and operating personnel and their families. Pripyat, with a population of 25,000 to 30,000, is 60 miles north of Kiev, at the point where the Chernigov-Kovel railroad crosses the Pripyat River. Soviet nuclear stations are rarely named for their location, and the Chernobyl station bears the name of a town 10 miles southeast of Pripyat. Chernobyl is one of the oldest of the 15 or so large nuclear power stations operating in the Soviet Union. According to regular progress reports in the Soviet press, construction began in the summer of 1972. The original plans were to install four 1,000-megawatt reactors, but by about 1980, it was announced that two more would be added. The first Chernobyl reactor began operating in 1977, followed the next year by the No. 2 unit. The third started up in 1981, and the fourth in 1983. In addition to the pressurized water reactor, widely used around the world, the Soviet Union has also been building graphite-moderated reactors, and the Chernobyl station is of this type. Graphite-Channel Reactors In these reactors, the nuclear fuel is contained in as many as 1,500 or more individual tubes or channels. According to Soviet scientists, these channel-type reactors reduce hazards associated with breakdowns in individual channels since a channel can be replaced without shutting down the entire reactor. The main disadvantages are said to be greater space requirements and higher construction costs. Although Soviet nuclear power engineers contend that safety is as much a concern to them as it is to their Western counterparts, early Soviet reactors were not enclosed in containment vessels, the large dome-shaped structures intended to confine radioactive leaks. The first vessel was built for a pressurized water reactor, the No. 5 unit of the Novovoronezhsky plant, in 1980. It is not known which of the Chernobyl reactors was involved in the accident and whether it had a containment dome. However, Soviet nuclear power planners have been confident enough on the safety issue to start building nuclear heating stations to supply cities with central steam heat. Since steam heat cannot be transmitted over long distances, such plants must be built in the suburbs of the cities they serve. The first such stations are being built in Gorky and Voronezh. Soviet nuclear power development has been consistently behind schedule because of a shortage of reactor manufacturing capacity and because of the construction delays that afflict nuclear programs around the world. In the 11th five-year plan, 1981-85, a total of 22,000 megwatts of new nuclear capacity was to be installed, but only 17,000 megawatts actually came on line. Setback at Atommash in 1983 Hopes for an early surge in making reactors were set back in 1983 when a huge reactor-assembly plant known as Atommash, a Russian acronym for atomic machinery, turned out to have been built too close to a water reservoir, causing the plant's foundations to be undermined. The management of the nuclear power industry was revamped, and a high Soviet Government official, Gennadi N. Fomin, who had been chairman of the State Committee of Civil Construction, was dismissed in July 1983 in a resulting scandal. At the same time, increased Soviet concern for regulatory supervision of the construction and operation of nuclear stations was demonstrated with the creation of a separate Government agency, the State Committee for Safety in the Atomic Power Industry. It is headed by Yevgeny V. Kulov, an engineer who was associated with the nuclear weapons program. One of the functions of the Chernobyl station and others near the Soviet Union's western border is to supply electricity to Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union has been transmitting about 20 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity a year to Eastern Europe. The Chernobyl station was connected to the grid in 1980, and a large part of its power output has been moving to Hungary. In 1984, the last year for which detailed data are available, Hungary was importing 8.8 billion kilowatt-hours from the Soviet Union.",1986-04-29T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world

For more than three decades, it has helped curb the spread of nuclear weapons. Since 9/11, however, and especially in the last several months, the viability of the treaty has been called into question. Some say it is obsolete. Others say it is merely ineffective. In support of its argument each side cites the situation in Iran, which has been able to advance a nuclear weapons program despite being a member of the treaty. The Iranian nuclear program -- and, to a lesser extent, the activities of Libya, which has also signed the treaty but announced last week it would give up all illegal weapons programs -- highlight both the utility and the limitations of the treaty. It is not obsolete; if the treaty did not exist, we almost certainly would want to invent it. At the same time, it would be a mistake to rely on it exclusively to address the problem of nuclear proliferation. Those who say the treaty is useless argue that the bad guys either don't sign the treaty, or they do and then cheat. The good guys sign and obey, but the treaty is irrelevant for these countries because they have no intention of becoming nuclear proliferators in the first place. This all-or-nothing argument is wrong. First, it fails to acknowledge that there is an important category in between good guys and bad guys. For these in-betweens -- countries like Ukraine, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Argentina or South Korea -- the weight of international opinion against proliferation expressed in the treaty has contributed to tipping the balance of decision-making against having nuclear weapons. Second, the treaty does have an impact even on ''bad guys'' like Iraq, Iran and North Korea. When the United States moves against such regimes, it does so with the support of the global opprobrium for nuclear weapons that the treaty enshrines. This consensus undergirds the multilateral approach that is under way to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, and was at the heart of the international pressure that persuaded Tehran to increase the transparency of its nuclear program. Even in the divisive case of Iraq, no one argued that Saddam Hussein should be left alone with weapons of mass destruction. Yet the treaty is not perfect. It allows, for example, nations that forswear nuclear weapons to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes. Signatories may build and operate nuclear power reactors, and they are permitted to produce enriched uranium that fuels the reactors, to store the radioactive spent fuel from those reactors, and to reprocess that spent fuel. The only specific obligations are that signatories declare these plants to the International Atomic Energy Agency and permit the agency to inspect them. The problem is that this ''closed fuel cycle'' gives these countries the inherent capacity to produce the fissile material required for a nuclear weapon. Facilities used to produce enriched uranium for power reactors can also be used to produce enriched uranium for weapons. Reprocessing spent fuel yields plutonium that can be fashioned into nuclear weapons. As North Korea and Iran demonstrate, regimes that intend to violate the treaty's ban on nuclear weapons can exploit this right to operate a nuclear power plant. While seeming to remain within the terms of the treaty, they can gather all the resources necessary to make nuclear weapons. Then they can abrogate the treaty and proceed to build a nuclear arsenal. The world should renew its determination to curb the spread of nuclear weapons by supplementing the current treaty with additional inducements and penalties. The key is to draw a distinction between the right to a peaceful civilian nuclear power program and the right to operate a closed fuel cycle. The first should be preserved -- and perhaps enhanced -- but the second should be seriously discouraged, if not prohibited. How might such a system work? In addition to their treaty obligations, those countries seeking to develop nuclear power to generate electricity would agree not to manufacture, store or reprocess nuclear fuel. They also would agree to submit to inspections (probably under the atomic energy agency) to verify their compliance. Those countries that now sell peaceful nuclear technology in accordance with the treaty, meanwhile, would agree not to provide technology, equipment or fuel for nuclear reactors and related facilities to any country that will not renounce its right to enrich and reprocess nuclear fuel, and agree not to sell or transfer any equipment or technology designed for the enrichment or reprocessing of nuclear fuel. At the same time, these countries would agree to guarantee the reliable supply of nuclear fuel, and retrieval of spent fuel at competitive prices, to those countries that do agree to this new arrangement. We might also consider sanctions on those countries that nevertheless choose to pursue a closed fuel cycle. Whatever the precise content and form of these undertakings, it would probably be better to treat them as a companion to that treaty, rather than embark on the complicated and controversial process of amending it. Why would any countries that want to develop a peaceful nuclear power program agree to such a bargain? One blunt answer is that if these restrictions were put in place, these countries would have virtually no choice, because developing the necessary technology from scratch is a daunting task. Refusing the arrangement would open them up to international scrutiny and pressure. On the other hand, any country that was truly interested in developing nuclear power for peaceful purposes would undoubtedly welcome a guaranteed supply of nuclear fuel. And why would countries that now supply nuclear technology be interested? First, no nation in this category has any interest in adding any country to the roster of the world's nuclear states. Second, over time, there probably is more money to be made in nuclear fuel services than in nuclear reactors. Iran provides an excellent opportunity to test this approach. Building on the progress recently announced in Tehran, the United States should propose that Russian plans to help Iran build a network of civilian nuclear power reactors be permitted to proceed -- provided that Iran enters into a verifiable ban on its enrichment and reprocessing abilities, and into an agreement to depend instead on a Russian-led suppliers' consortium for nuclear fuel services. The Russians would be likely to embrace such a proposal for commercial and political reasons, and the Iranians would be confronted with a clear test of whether they harbor nuclear weapons ambitions. Britain, France and Germany, whose foreign ministers recently proposed a similar scheme to Iran, would need only to avoid the temptation to undercut the Russians on behalf of their own nuclear industry. And the United States could reap the benefits of offering a constructive initiative to address the Iranian nuclear problem. Of course, this new arrangement would hardly be a cure-all. And making it work would be difficult. But at a time when its effectiveness and relevance are being questioned, such an approach would strengthen the treaty by furthering its goals: preventing the spread of nuclear weapons while promoting the development of peaceful nuclear energy.

To the Editor: I cannot agree more with Farhad Manjoo that “nuclear’s problems don’t mean we should shut down all nuclear plants; existing plants are quite valuable in our energy mix as we ramp up solar and wind.” However, nuclear plant operators around the world have to do much more than what they have done so far to ensure the safety of this viable energy generation technology. Because of the double exigencies of energy security and the growing need for decarbonization, many nuclear plants will be given life extensions. Germany will keep two of its three remaining nuclear power plants operational, and just recently, California lawmakers extended the life of the only operating nuclear plant, Diablo Canyon. Based on my last 35 years of research experience in nuclear safety and visiting more than dozen nuclear reactors around the world, including Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima, I would like to point out that two of these three major nuclear accidents with long-lasting consequences — Three Mile Island and Chernobyl — were preventable and instigated by internal, not external, causes, which were primarily due to human factors, safety culture and regulatory oversight issues. The world nuclear power industry and regulatory agencies need to double down their genuine efforts to improve human factors and safety culture considerations. Najmedin Meshkati Los Angeles The writer is a professor of engineering and international relations at the University of Southern California. To the Editor: Had development of small-scale cookie-cutter nuclear power plants and nuclear batteries not been sidetracked by prejudice drawn from past misadventures and a focus on giant facilities, and had alternative sources of energy not been so massively subsidized, nuclear would have already displaced wind and solar. Farhad Manjoo is correct that large-scale nuclear plants are problematic, but intermittent, unreliable energy generation is not a cost-effective, feasible replacement. The cost of standby backup is very high, and hopes for batteries as utility energy storage have foundered on the competition for the scarce elements needed for their production.",2022-10-01T17:30:07.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

He said his ultimate goal was 100 new nuclear plants. Mr. McCain has long promoted nuclear reactors, but Wednesday was the first time that he specified the number of plants he envisioned. Currently there are 104 reactors in the country supplying some 20 percent of electricity consumed. No new nuclear power plant has been built in the United States since the 1970s. “China, Russia and India are all planning to build more than a hundred new power plants among them in the coming decades,” Mr. McCain said in this pocket of Missouri that is reliably Republican. “Across Europe there are 197 reactors in operation, and nations including France and Belgium derive more than half their electricity from nuclear power. And if all of these nations can find a way to carry out great goals in energy policy, then I assure you that the United States is more than equal to the challenge.” Although there has been a shift of opinion in the industry and among some environmentalists toward more nuclear power  it is clean and far safer than at the time of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979  most environmentalists are skeptical of the latest claims by its advocates. They also say that no utility will put its own financing into building a plant unless the federal government lavishly subsidizes it. “Wall Street won’t invest in these plants because they are too expensive and unreliable, so Senator McCain wants to shower the nuclear industry with billions of dollars of taxpayer handouts,” said Daniel J. Weiss, who heads the global warming program at the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a liberal research group. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Mr. McCain’s chief domestic policy adviser, said Mr. McCain had arrived at the goal of 45 as consistent with his desire to expand nuclear power, “but not so large as to be infeasible given permitting and construction times.”",2008-06-19T08:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,national-u.s.-politics

The Soviet Government disclosed Tuesday that in addition to the damaged No. 4 reactor at the Chernobyl station, the three remaining 1,000-megawatt units, though described as being in working order, had also been taken out of service for the time being. The resulting loss of 4,000 megawatts of generating capacity is equivalent to depriving a metropolitan center of four million people of electricity. The Soviet Union's total installed electrical capacity is 315,000 megawatts, 60 percent of that of the United States. The loss of the Chernobyl power plant, which is at Pripyat, 70 miles north of Kiev, is also likely to affect Soviet electricity exports to Hungary, which has been largely dependent on power from the Chernobyl station. Out of annual Eastern European imports of 20 billion kilowatt-hours of Soviet electricity, Hungary has been receiving nine billion kilowatt-hours, or 45 percent of the total. The imports represent one-fourth of the needs of Hungary, which generates only 27 billion kilowatt-hours a year in domestic power plants. By comparison, the Chernobyl station alone has been producing more than 20 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity a year and, after feeding most of its output into the Soviet grid, has been transmitting the rest to Hungary over a 750-kilovolt line completed in 1980. No reduction in Hungarian imports from the Soviet Union has been reported thus far since the nuclear accident. Further exports of Soviet nuclear power to Eastern Europe are planned when a 750-kilovolt line to Rumania and Bulgaria is completed from the existing South Ukraine generating station, and another such line starts transmitting electricity from the Khmelnitsky plant, also in the Ukraine and now in the final stages of construction. The Soviet accident also introduces a new element into a long-ranging dispute among Soviet energy planners over the proposed construction of a costly long-distance power line that would transmit electricity from Siberia and other eastern regions to supplement the nuclear power supply of the European part of the Soviet Union. The importance of the Chernobyl plant in the Soviet nuclear power industry is suggested by the fact that its 4,000 megawatts represented 14 percent of the Soviet Union's total nuclear generating capacity of 28,000 megawatts in service at the end of 1985. Soviet planners have been counting on nuclear power as a source of electricity for the nation's industrialized and densely populated European regions because of diminishing fossil fuel sources in that part of the Soviet Union. The 12th five-year plan, beginning this year, envisages the installation of 41,000 megawatts of nuclear capacity, which, if fulfilled, would raise Soviet nuclear capacity to nearly 70,000 megawatts by the end of 1990. Although nuclear plants now represent only 11 percent of the power output in the Soviet Union as a whole, they contribute a higher percentage in the European part, where they are concentrated, and particularly in the Ukraine, one of the most highly industrialized of the Soviet republics. The decline in nuclear power availability, at least over the short run, is likely to be made up by more generation from fossil-fuel burning plants and from hydroelectric stations. Out of the Soviet Union's total electricity production of 1,545 billion kilowatt-hours last year, 1,169 billion was provided by fossil-fuel stations, 206 billion by hydroelectric plants, and 170 billion by nuclear stations. Greater use of fossil-fuel and hydroelectric stations runs against Soviet policy, which favors the rapid expansion of nuclear generating capacity. Energy planners have been trying to reduce fossil fuel use because of tight supplies of oil and high-grade coal. They have also sought to limit the use of hydroelectric stations to meeting the additional power needs of peak demand periods because of the ease with which such stations can be shut down and started up again. The dispute over the long-distance transmission of electricity from the eastern to the western regions of the Soviet Union flared up again in recent months when opponents argued in the Jan. 12 issue of the Moscow newspaper Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya that a long-projected 1,500-mile line was no longer needed because of the buildup of nuclear capacity in the west. The transmission line would operate at 1.5 million volts and employ an advanced type of direct-current technology - most power lines transmit alternating current - and would run from a power complex next to open-pit coal mines at Ekibastuz to Tambov in central European Russia. The cost of the line has been put at one billion rubles ($1.4 billion). Advocates of the ambitious project, replying Feb. 5 in Pravda, argued that the line was still needed, not so much to move electricity from east to west, but to transmit electricity back and forth to meet fluctuations in demand. On April 11, Pravda published a reaction from the Ministry of Electric Power, saying that it had been persuaded by the pro-transmission argument and setting a new target date of 1989 for partial construction, and 1991 for completion of the project. The breakdown of nuclear generating capacity at the Chernobyl plant is now likely to reinforce further the position of those who have favored construction of the Ekibastuz-Tambov transmission project.",1986-05-01T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world

The announcement will open a potential $60 billion market to the American nuclear power industry. The Clinton Administration's formal certification will come next week in a statement submitted to Congress. It will include China's assurances that Beijing has stopped helping Pakistan or any other country build a nuclear bomb; that it is ending its nuclear-power projects with Iran, including the construction of a uranium-conversion plant; and that it is setting up a system to control exports of weapons technology by state and private companies. The certification is based on assurances from China, monitoring by international agencies, intelligence reports and other information. The certification, 12 years in the making, is primarily aimed at stopping the spread of nuclear-weapons technology. ''It's very much in the national interest, because it serves our nonproliferation goals,'' said Gary Samore, the National Security Council's senior director for nonproliferation and export controls. The certification will open what is likely to become the world's largest nuclear power market to companies like Westinghouse and General Electric. The American nuclear power industry, which has not built a plant in the United States since the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, hopes to sell China goods and services worth tens of billions of dollars. Under a 1985 agreement, American companies could not sell nuclear plants to China unless China stopped selling nuclear-weapons technology to other nations. In the meantime, China bought Canadian and French reactors and talked to Germany and Russia about buying more. Ending Chinese sales of nuclear-weapons technology to Pakistan, which has been working in secret on building nuclear weapons and is believed capable of assembling several nuclear bombs on short notice, was the most crucial goal of the certification process, Administration officials said. Beijing's nuclear cooperation with Iran has been peaceful and took place under the surveillance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, White House officials said. China has also pledged to stop selling cruise missiles to Iran that could be used against American military or commercial ships in the Persian Gulf. Congress could still pass a law overturning the President's certification. Or it could try to impose stricter conditions to be met before American nuclear-power salesmen set up shop in China.

Nuclear-friendly politicians dominate most of Fukui’s government offices, and the region is nicknamed Genpatsu Ginza, or Nuclear Alley. Fukui has now emerged as a battleground for the Japanese government’s effort to rebuild the nuclear industry and reverse the economic impact of the reactor shutdowns. On Tuesday, a local judge blocked the latest attempt to get atomic power back on the grid, issuing an injunction forbidding the restarting of two nuclear reactors at the Takahama power plant in the region. The nuclear industry has been in a state of paralysis since the meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant four years ago. None of the 48 usable reactors in Japan are back online. Business groups say that delays in returning at least some plants to service are wrecking their bottom line. The price of electricity has increased by 20 percent or more, reflecting the cost of importing more oil and natural gas to make up for the lost nuclear power. That translates to the equivalent of several tens of billions of dollars a year in added expenses for households and companies, according to government estimates. It is a potential stumbling block for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s efforts to rekindle economic growth, which have focused on increasing corporate profits and consumer spending. Because of the increased use of fossil fuels, Japan’s carbon emissions have also risen in the four years since the country began taking its reactors offline. The decline in oil prices, which have fallen about 50 percent since June, has taken some of the pressure off the economy. But the government nonetheless sees a revival of nuclear power as critical to supporting growth and slowing an exodus of Japanese industry to lower-cost countries. The Kansai Electric Power Company, which owns the plant at the heart of the ruling issued on Tuesday, serves a swath of western Japan that includes the metropolis of Osaka. The area served is also home to industrial giants like Panasonic. Yoshihide Suga, the chief cabinet secretary for Mr. Abe, questioned the scientific rationale for the Fukui court’s decision and said it would not alter the government’s support for nuclear power. “The reactors have been judged by experts to meet the new safety standards,” Mr. Suga said, referring to a review by the Nuclear Regulation Authority of Japan that was completed late last year. The agency determined that the Takahama reactors met tougher guidelines introduced after the Fukushima disaster. “We will respect that judgment, and there is no change to our policy of moving ahead with restarts,” Mr. Suga said. Kansai Electric had intended the reactors in Fukui to be among the first in the country to be returned to service after the introduction of the new rules more than two years ago. But in his ruling on Tuesday, the judge, Hideaki Higuchi, challenged the adequacy of the standards, which cover things like plants’ resistance to earthquakes and tsunamis, the triggers for the Fukushima disaster. “There is little rational basis for saying that an earthquake with a magnitude that exceeds the safety standard will not occur,” said Judge Higuchi, 62. “It is an optimistic view.” The reactors had been widely expected to return to service by the end of the year. While Kansai Electric said it would appeal, experts said its plans could be delayed by months or even years. It was the second time Judge Higuchi had issued an order forbidding a nuclear plant in Fukui to operate, and he remains the only judge in Japan to have ruled against a utility over nuclear restarts since Fukushima. He became a hero among antinuclear activists in May when he ruled that two reactors at another Kansai Electric facility, the Oi nuclear plant, must remain switched off because the utility had not shown that they could be operated safely. Judge Higuchi’s decision on Tuesday was potentially more significant because it directly challenged the new safety standards set out by the Nuclear Regulation Authority. It was his first ruling against a plant that had been certified as safe under the new regulations; the Oi power station had yet to undergo a safety review. The injunction was requested by a group of nine residents of Fukui and surrounding prefectures. “This ruling is a historic step toward abolishing nuclear power, and the government and power company should respect it,” a lawyer for the group told NHK, Japan’s national broadcaster. Judge Higuchi’s critics say he lacks the technical expertise to reach conclusions about nuclear safety. Shinichi Nishikawa, a professor at Meiji University, said Japanese judges were often reluctant to challenge government policies. He noted that Judge Higuchi had spent his career in low-level local courts and was “not part of the elite” judiciary, where rulings favorable to the government can be a precondition for promotion. “Last year’s ruling took courage, but this ruling may have taken even more courage,” Professor Nishikawa said. Japan’s nuclear shutdown has created serious financial problems for utilities like Kansai Electric, which before the accident relied on atomic power to generate nearly 30 percent of its electricity. Several utilities, including Kansai Electric, have received low-interest loans and other emergency aid from the government. Since he took office in late 2012, Mr. Abe has reversed a pledge by a previous government to wean Japan off nuclear power completely over the next several decades. The governing Liberal Democratic Party is formulating a long-term energy strategy that is expected to set a target of about 20 percent for nuclear power’s share of electricity generation.",2015-04-14T17:03:37.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

SOUND FROM SHOREHAM, A NUCLEAR PLANT IS MET WITH YAWNS","The people who live along this stretch of New England coastline have much in common with their neighbors in Suffolk and Nassau Counties, just across Long Island Sound. Residents of both shores enjoy sheltered harbors and sandy beaches. On either side of the water are tackle shops offering ''shiners and sandworms'' and nautically named restaurants serving ''grog and grub.'' Both areas also happen to have imposing new citadels of high technology perched by the sound's edge: nuclear power plants that are completed and heading toward commercial operation. That is where the similarity abruptly ends. On Long Island, citizen groups and many local politicians, with the support of New York's Governor and United States Senators, are strenuously opposing the opening of the Long Island Lighting Company's $4.6 billion, 820-megawatt Shoreham nuclear power station, carrying out their fight in the courts and in the halls of government. Shoreham has not yet received its license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and if its opponents prevail, it never will. By contrast, here in Waterford, where Northeast Utilities' $3.82 billion, 1,150-megawatt Millstone 3 nuclear power plant has been licensed and is to begin commercial operation within a few weeks, the public reaction has been nonchalance. ''People here are not in the least upset,'' said First Selectman Lawrence J. Bettencourt, Waterford's chief elected official. ''It's really not an issue.'' Interviews with other residents of the area confirmed that view. ''I'm not worried and I certainly haven't seen anybody selling their houses,'' said Sheila Helgeson, who works at A Thyme to Cook, a gourmet shop. And over at Mitchell College, Charles McElaney, a 23-year-old life sciences major, said: ''I've never really heard people talking about it. Right now drinking and driving is the hot issue on campus.'' Mr. Bettencourt said nuclear power had not been debated in any local election that he could recall. On Long Island, however, nuclear power ranks right along with abortion and defense spending as among the thorniest issues a politician faces. Such divergences can be found from site to site across the United States, experts on the nuclear industry say. For example, there has long been intense opposition to the opening of a nuclear plant in Seabrook, N.H., while at the new Hope Creek plant in southern New Jersey, ''it's no big deal,'' according to Lisa Salamon, a spokesman for the plant's owner, the Public Service Electric and Gas Company. Familiar With Nuclear Industries The explanations offered vary depending on who is asked. Residents of Waterford and the surrounding towns point out that they have been living amid nuclear industries for a long time. The Millstone 1 and Millstone 2 nuclear plants, adjacent to Millstone 3, have been in commercial operation since 1970 and 1975 respectively. Just up the Connecticut coast are a division of General Dynamics that builds nuclear submarines and a Navy nuclear submarine base. Many military families live near the base as well as around the Coast Guard Academy in nearby New London. ''There's a lot of employment around here connected with nuclear power,'' said Fran Moreno, owner of the Made To Be Loved Doll Hospital in the neighboring community of Niantic, within sight of Millstone 3. ''People have come to understand it and accept it. It doesn't frighten us.'' On Long Island, by comparison, chain reactions are currently occurring only at two small nuclear reactors used in physics research at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. But Jeffrey Newman, a public relations consultant and the vice president of the Coalition for Safe Living, an umbrella organization of 35 groups opposed to Shoreham, has other thoughts on why Long Island residents have not learned to stop worrying and love the nuclear reactor. He argued that ''consciousnesses have been raised on the island'' in regard to the nuclear power issue, largely because of the heated debate over the long delayed opening of the Lilco plant. Shoreham received its construction permit 16 years ago this month. Mr. Newman, along with other opponents of Shoreham, also maintains that the peculiarities of Long Island's geography make the area particularly inappropriate for a nuclear power station. ''People in Connecticut would at least have a fighting chance to get away in case of an accident,'' he said. ''But you can't evacuate this island. If you've ever tried to go to New York from the Hamptons in summer, you know there's no way you're going to move people rapidly out of the way of a plume'' of radiation leakage. Proponents of nuclear power, such as Anthony J. Castagno, a spokesman for Northeast Utilities, counter that the chances of a nuclear accident that would require a wholesale evacuation are ''almost negligible.'' And even in a worst-case scenario, he and others stress, the need would be to move people up to 10 miles away from Shoreham rather than completely off the island. Mr. Newman answered by saying that thousands of frightened residents would flee no matter what. Based largely on that view, Suffolk County leaders have refused to cooperate with Lilco's emergency planning. Emergency Planning Praised Over in Waterford, that puzzles people. ''We were the first municipality in the country to have an emergency plan,'' Mr. Bettencourt said. ''I've never had to use it for a nuclear accident, of course, but we have used it several times for other emergencies, for instance during Hurricane Gloria last fall. The mechanisms are the same and they work very well.'' A leading Shoreham opponent, Maurice Barbash, the Suffolk County builder who heads Citizens to Replace Lilco, said that what concerned him most was neither the concept of nuclear power nor the geography of Long Island. ''As a builder, why do I fear the plant?'' Mr. Barbash asked. ''Because I don't think we know what went into it. My opposition to Shoreham is based on the record of mismanagement there.'' As evidence of past mismanagement, he cited findings by New York State's Public Service Commission that almost $1.4 billion of the plant's costs had not been ''prudently incurred.'' And as evidence of current mismanagement he cited recent findings by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of ''serious deficiencies'' in the Shoreham radio-chemistry program, which tests reactor coolants and other liquids for compliance with nuclear and environmental regulations. Lilco has since suspended the employees said to be responsible for those deficiences and hired a consultant to retrain personnel and repair the program. Spokesmen for the corporation noted that the physical integrity of the plant had been thoroughly examined by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and that both the plant and its procedures underwent continual testing. Reflecting on all this, Mr. Bettencourt wondered whether a communications failure might not lie at the heart of Long Island's nuclear conflict. ''The way I look at it, from what I read, it seems that nobody there is talking to the other guy,'' he said. ''Here, we have a problem, we all sit down together and we try to work it out.''",1986-04-12T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,metropolitan-desk-new-york

It has been at the forefront of climate policy for decades — from demanding stringent fuel economy and emissions standards to wholeheartedly embracing renewable energy from the sun and wind. It has fighting words for the incoming administration of Donald Trump. “We will not deviate from our leadership because of one election,” the State Senate leader, Kevin de Leon, told The New York Times . Last fall, the state legislature committed to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent below their 1990 level by 2030. “California is doing something that no other state has done,” proclaimed Gov. Jerry Brown . State policies were always bound to play a central role in the decarbonization of the American economy. But with a president-elect who has asserted that climate change is a Chinese hoax , promised a bright future for fossil fuels and vowed to undo President Obama’s climate strategy, their choices have become more important than ever. And yet for all the pluck of the Golden State’s politicians, California is far from providing the leadership needed in the battle against climate change. Distracted by the competing objective of shuttering nuclear plants that still produce over a fifth of its zero-carbon power, the state risks failing the main environmental challenge of our time. Mark Muro, director of policy at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, has compiled a ranking of progress toward decarbonization within the United States. In 2014, he found, California had the third-lowest carbon dioxide emissions per person, behind only the District of Columbia and New York. Its progress of late, however, has been less than stellar: Despite its aggressive deployment of wind turbines and solar panels, the carbon intensity of California’s economy — measured by the CO 2 emissions per unit of economic product — declined by only 26.6 percent between 2000 and 2014. That put it in 28th place. In New York, which came in seventh, carbon intensity declined 35.4 percent. It is not entirely California’s fault. Persistent drought has drastically cut its supply of hydroelectric power . Still, the state’s carbon emissions were also driven by its own choices: Added to the hydroelectricity slump, the 2012 closing of the San Onofre nuclear plant north of San Diego left a void in the power supply that even a vast increase in solar and wind generation could not replace. So it was mostly filled with natural gas. New York, by contrast, left its nuclear plants running. It even offered upstate generators subsidies similar to those available to renewable energy generators, to help them survive the cutthroat competition against cheap power fueled by natural gas. But even a state like New York still has work to do. An analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers argued that to ensure that the global temperature does not rise more than 3.6 degrees above its preindustrial average, which world leaders have agreed is the tolerable limit, the carbon intensity of the global economy must decline 6.3 percent per year between now and 2030. The United States must decarbonize at an annual rate of 4.3 percent under that timetable. But over the last decade and a half, only North Dakota and the District of Columbia have achieved this pace. New York is decarbonizing at about 3 percent per year, California at barely above 2 percent. What’s more, most of the gains in the United States have come relatively easily, not from the deployment of renewables but from the wholesale switch from coal to cheaper and cleaner natural gas. Much of that transition has played itself out, however. Further gains will be more expensive. “What’s critical to think about is, Where are the next savings going to come from?” Mr. Muro told me. “Divergent state dynamics on nuclear energy will become a crucial issue in the next 40 years.” Taking nuclear energy off the table has already pushed the nation too far in the wrong way. Consider this bit of counterfactual history. Environmental Progress, an advocacy group that aggressively supports the deployment of nuclear energy to combat climate change, estimated what California’s power sector would look like had the opposition from antinuclear forces — including Governor Brown — not undone the state’s deployment of nuclear energy, starting in the 1970s. The power from San Onofre and the Rancho Seco nuclear generation station near Sacramento, both now shuttered, added to that from the never-built Sundesert nuclear plant in the Mojave Desert and three planned-but-not-built units at Diablo Canyon on the state’s central coast, would add a total of 77,000 gigawatt-hours of zero-carbon power to California’s supply. Only 27 percent of the power produced in California would come from fossil sources, other things remaining equal, as opposed to 66 percent today. And carbon emissions from power generation would be only 40 percent of what they are today. Nuclear energy cannot compete with natural gas at current prices, of course. But its woes aren’t just about economics. Incorporating the climate costs imposed by fossil fuels would sharply increase the cost of gas generation. But rather than level the playing field, policy makers mostly squeeze nuclear generation further. There’s a reason for that: Alarmed by the prospect of nuclear meltdowns and the potential damage to ecosystems and human health, voters remain decidedly against nuclear reactors. Still, if combating climate change is an imperative, nuclear power and its risks must get a more careful assessment . Climate change will be hard to stop without it. Consider Germany, which vowed both to replace its nuclear energy with renewable energy sources and to make great strides in combating climate change. Last year it got less energy from the sun despite having more solar panels than the year before. An 11 percent increase in wind capacity produced a 1 percent increase in wind power. And Germany’s carbon emissions from energy rose . At several moments last winter, a high-pressure system reduced wind and solar power to a small fraction of total demand. What if this happened in 2030? About a third of German power comes from renewables, on an average day. Even if the Germans had three times as much renewable generation capacity, there would be periods when it wouldn’t come close to satisfying demand. With no nuclear energy to speak of, the gap would have to be filled with fossil fuels. “One cannot simultaneously rely on massive amounts of wind and sunshine, dispense with nuclear power plants (for very good reasons), significantly lower the supply of fossil energy, and nevertheless tell people that electricity will definitely be available in the future,” noted the German economist Heiner Flassbeck . Unfortunately, it doesn’t look as if America’s governors and state legislators will take the lesson to heart. California is on track to shutter Diablo Canyon , its last remaining nuclear power plant. And in New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo just announced an agreement to close the Indian Point nuclear plant. When that happens, the state will lose almost a quarter of its zero-carbon power. Maybe New York’s carbon emissions won’t immediately kick back up. The state government argues that it will fill the gap with renewable energy, gains in efficiency and the like. It has also committed to cutting greenhouse-gas emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. And it is promising that half its power will come from renewable sources. Still, it’s hard not to think that the battle against climate change has, once again, been relegated to the back seat.",2017-01-17T18:55:12.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-economy

The cure for the greenhouse effect, the warming of the atmosphere that is believed to be caused by the burning of fossil fuels, is a huge shift to nuclear-generated power, speaker after speaker told delegates at a World Energy Conference meeting this week. But a few speakers predicted that more efficient electrical and electronic consumer products would make a big shift to nuclear power unnecessary, while others criticized the cost of reactor-generated electricity. For the most part, however, the consensus at the weeklong 14th congress of the London-based organization, which has members in 80 countries, was that greater reliance on nuclear power is needed. Essential for Third World Bong-Suh Lee, South Korea's Minister of Energy and Resources, said nuclear power was the solution to environmental and supply problems and that ''this is especially so for resource-poor developing countries.'' John Wakeham, Secretary of State for Energy in Britain, said his country was requiring that its Government-owned electricity industry, which is now being sold to the public, generate electricity without burning fossil fuels. ''The developed world may well have to turn increasingly to nuclear energy to protect our environment in the years ahead and make room for more use of fossil energy in countries with less-suitable infrastructure,'' he said. W. Henson Moore, the United States Deputy Energy Secretary, said it was essential to resume reactor construction, which has nearly halted in both the United States and Canada and has slowed markedly elsewhere. ''Given some time and concerted effort, we can again make nuclear energy a viable choice,'' Mr. Moore said. Lord Marshall of Goring, the chairman of the Central Electricity Generating Board in Britain, said: ''The design of nuclear reactors has now reached an advanced, sophisticated and mature level. For the public at large, the risk is to all intents and purposes zero.'' But those who opposed nuclear power generally said that rather than replace generators fired by coal, oil and natural-gas with reactors, it would be less expensive to retire the old non-nuclear generators by decreasing the demand for electricity through use of more efficient motors, lights and other electrical and electronic products. Some opponents of nuclear power also took issue with its cost. ''Nuclear power throughout the world's market economies, and even in Communist countries, is dying of an incurable attack of market forces,'' said Amory Lovins, a consultant who specializes in efficiency technologies. Wall Street discounts the stock and debt issues of companies with nuclear investments, he said, and investors would remain skeptical ''until promoters bring money in themselves and stop importuning the Treasury to put our money where their mouth is.'' Nuclear plants would not be built in the United States, he said, without insurance concessions and other advantages given by Congress. Mr. Lovins and other speakers said third world electricity producers and users were markedly less efficient than those in industrialized countries. Nuclear Slowdown A World Energy Conference study estimated that reactors would provide 7 or 8 percent of energy supplies in 2020; six years ago, the group said it would be 12 percent. Currently, about 400 reactors are operating, providing about 4 percent of the world's energy supplies. About 100 more reactors are under construction. The construction rate is far short of what would be required to use reactors to halt global warming. Alvin Weinberg, an energy expert at Oak Ridge National Laboratories, calculated that in 100 years, if the world were to institute stringent efficiency measures and cut fuel burning to the level required to stabilize the atmosphere, 5,000 reactors would be needed. But he concluded that current designs would not be adequate. He said the chance of a meltdown at a given plant is great enough that if multiplied by 5,000, it would produce an unacceptably high risk.",1989-09-25T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business

While your concern for reprocessing is understandable, your criticism misses the mark. The Long Island Power Authority is concerned about reprocessing and whether or not Shoreham's fuel might set a precedent for increasing trade in plutonium. That is why we continue to explore alternative options to dispose of Shoreham's highly contaminated fuel rod bundles. Our decision to enter into a reprocessing agreement with Cogema, a French nuclear company, was necessary to protect Long Island Lighting Company ratepayers should our limited fuel-disposal options -- shipping the fuel to a utility for reuse or on-site storage at Shoreham -- fail to materialize. What is surprising is that you fail to criticize the real culprits in the Shoreham fuel fiasco: the Federal Government for failing to come up with a permanent disposal site for high-level radioactive waste, and Lilco, which contaminated Shoreham in 1985 in a foolhardy effort to try to force the opening of the plant on Long Island. In reality, the Long Island Power Authority is only being asked to clean up the mess left by the nuclear industry, which misled the American public into believing that a long-term disposal facility for highly contaminated nuclear waste would be ready well before the more than 100 nuclear facilities were decommissioned. Many critics of Shoreham and other nuclear facilities urged the Atomic Energy Commission and its succcessor, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, to deny nuclear facility operating licenses until the waste disposal issue was resolved. Our contentions of the 1960's and 70's that no waste disposal system would be ready to handle nuclear waste was on target. The Shoreham fuel-disposal issue, as complicated as it is, will pale compared with the problems utilities will face all around the country as they prepare to decommission their nuclear units and discover that there's no place to ship the used fuel and other highly contaminated materials produced after years of use. The Federal Government's abysmal performance in siting a waste facility will cost electric ratepayers billions of dollars in storage costs until a site is chosen, or is ever built at all. As for Shoreham, Lilco ratepayers are faced with this expensive problem because Lilco, with the undying support of you and others, went ahead and tested the plant at low power without the assurance of its ever operating for commercial purposes. The resulting contamination of the plant and its fuel requires the new owners of the plant, the Long Island Power Authority, to decommission the facility and dispose of the contaminated materials. While low-level radioactive waste is disposed of by shipment to the Barnwell facility, there is no repository for high-level waste and Shoreham's fuel. And the disposal options are limited to reprocessing, reuse in another reactor (only a dozen or so reactors around the world can accommodate the bundles, and most of these would prefer new fuel) or on-site storage at Shoreham, a stand-alone facility with a cost estimated at $66 million, assuming that nothing goes wrong at any nuclear plant anywhere in the next 40 years to require major modifications and excessive costs to Lilco and its ratepayers. Instead of criticizing the Long Island Power Authority for the Shoreham fuel mess that it did not create, you should point the spotlight on the Federal Government and the nuclear and utility industry for failing to develop a long-term program to deal with nuclear waste. The Shoreham problem is only the beginning of a nuclear waste crisis that has no answer. RICHARD M.

If the country’s 50 nuclear reactors were permanently closed this year, power companies would be hit with losses totaling 4.4 trillion yen ($55.9 billion), rendering at least four of them insolvent, according to calculations this summer by the government’s Agency for Natural Resources and Energy. The extraordinary costs of an immediate shutdown have emerged as a major concern for the Japanese government, which has struggled to balance the desire for improved nuclear safety with the bottom-line realities of the big utilities. Nuclear plants generated about one-third of Japan’s electricity before the Fukushima accident, but most remain at least temporarily offline. “People talk easily about shutting down Japan’s nuclear power plants, but the economic and financial consequences are severe,” said Reiji Takeishi, professor in environmental economics at Tokyo International University. The government is now considering at least three options to reduce the country’s dependence on nuclear power — and all of them would give the power companies until 2030 to shut their reactors permanently, allowing them to largely recoup their plant investments. By 2030 the majority of reactors would be older than 40 years and would face decommissioning anyway under Japanese guidelines. But a series of fresh safety concerns, including possibly active fault lines beneath nuclear sites, have raised doubts about whether the nuclear reactors should be restarted at all. And the proposed 18-year timetable has angered the country’s growing antinuclear movement, which complained that the government had its priorities wrong. “How can you put the economy above safety, above human life?” Masanori Oda, a contemporary artist and a representative of the movement, said after a meeting with Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda last week. One option being considered by the government would reduce the country’s dependence on nuclear power to 20 to 25 percent of electrical needs by 2030. A second option would cut the segment to 15 percent, and a third would eliminate nuclear power entirely. Though the 15 percent proposal initially gained traction, public hearings and opinion polls have shown overwhelming support for a complete phaseout. All of the proposals could involve progressively restarting the country’s reactors. In recent days, a string of governing party lawmakers and government ministers have also expressed support for the so-called zero option, with an eye on nationwide elections that could be called within months. The fate of the nuclear reactors is part of a larger and highly charged discussion over the costs and benefits of nuclear energy and its alternatives. Much of the argument has tended to focus on the wider economic costs of turning away from nuclear power. Japan’s biggest and most influential business lobby, the Keidanren, warns of disaster. Hundreds of thousands of jobs would be lost, the group says, and energy alternatives would be hampered by problems. Already Japan’s fuel imports have surged since the Fukushima disaster, driving the country’s trade deficit to record highs. Though Japan has so far avoided blackouts this summer, power shortages are weighing on businesses. Japan’s greenhouse gas emissions are also surging, and renewable energies such as wind and solar power remain small-scale, expensive and unreliable, the lobbying group says. “If we do not have a stable supply of energy at economically viable prices, Japan’s economy cannot grow,” the group said earlier this month. The economic stakes for the utilities could be even higher in the shorter term. A government-appointed panel of experts warned this year that there is a possibly active fault line under the Shika Nuclear Power Plant, 170 miles north of Kyoto, raising the possibility that the location could be declared unfit for a nuclear facility. The plant’s operator, the Hokuriku Electric Power Company, would be pushed to near-insolvency with losses of at least 313 billion yen ($3.97 billion) if it were forced to shut the two reactors, the government calculations show. The losses would stem from extra costs of early decommissioning, write-downs on other nuclear assets, as well as the costs of offloading the plant’s nuclear waste and fuel, according to those calculations. Another troubled utility is Chubu Electric, which is desperate to save the No. 5 reactor at its Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant, the newest unit at the site and the country’s largest. The unit opened in 2005 but has been offline since last May, when Naoto Kan, then prime minister, effectively ordered it closed on fears that it lies on a particularly tsunami-prone coastline. During the shutdown, however, about 1,300 gallons of seawater entered the reactor because of a burst pipe, and it is thought to be corroding the reactor core. Two smaller utilities, Hokkaido Electric and Tohoku Electric, would fare even worse: the cost of writing off their reactors would drive them into insolvency, the government estimates. Both utilities face concerns that their reactors also face bigger quake risks than previously thought. And Tokyo Electric — Japan’s largest utility, and the operator of the ravaged Fukushima Daiichi plant — would be forced to take additional write-downs of 1.15 trillion yen ($14.6 billion) if it were unable to reopen its 13 remaining reactors, including two at the tsunami-ravaged Fukushima Daiichi site, and four more at a sister site just 10 miles away. The local Fukushima government is calling for all of the utility’s reactors to remain permanently closed. But that would be disastrous for a company effectively nationalized last month because of the exorbitant costs of the accident and compensation payments. “I really don’t see a scenario that the power companies will be made to go to zero in the near term,” said Penn Bowers, a research analyst who covers Japan’s power companies at CLSA Japanese Equities. “You would go into negative equity for some of those companies,” he said. “I don’t think that’s a choice, because there are not alternative suppliers. You need these companies to remain going concerns.” Those who favor phasing out nuclear power argue that the costs of another disaster would easily outweigh other considerations. They are optimistic about developing renewable energy, especially with heavy public investment, and say new technologies in that field could cut down on emissions and create new jobs. “The assumptions underlying the economics of nuclear power no longer hold up,” said Terumitsu Honma, a professor in economics and insurance at Aoyama Gakuin University in Tokyo. “The biggest assumption was that accidents don’t happen.” The utility companies have a strong incentive to push the government for permission to restart their reactors, even with the risks. Because the cost of another disaster would most likely be greater than the value of the companies, private insurers have been unwilling to insure the utilities — putting the government on the hook for any damages. As such, the risks of restarting Japan’s reactors, both financially and in terms of safety, would be borne by the Japanese taxpayers, while any benefits would go to the utilities and their shareholders, said J. Mark Ramseyer, a professor at Harvard Law School who wrote an article about the Japanese nuclear industry this month in an academic journal, Theoretical Inquiries in Law. “They capture all the returns, but bear less than all of the costs,” he said in an e-mail.",2012-08-29T17:14:04.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

THE United States and the Soviet Union are drawing up elaborate plans for the use of nuclear power in space, reigniting fears that radioactive debris from an accident will sooner or later come raining down on the Earth. About 70 atomic power sources already dot the heavens, the result of satellites and spacecraft launched by the two nations in the past quarter century. Now bold plans are being accelerated in both countries that could lead to the launching of dozens more nuclear power sources for civilian space projects and conceivably hundreds of such generators for a proposed Star Wars missile defense system. New, more powerful nuclear sources are being readied to power and propel military satellites, space stations, robot probes to distant planets, Moon bases and manned expeditions to Mars. The trend is considered inevitable by many scientists who see atomic energy as the best way to power an increasingly wide variety of spacecraft. Nuclear energy can be delivered in far larger amounts than power from chemical or solar devices carried aboard spacecraft and is particularly useful for missions too distant from the Sun to rely on solar panels. But opponents remain fearful that nuclear debris will eventually fall back to Earth, and some see the rush toward nuclear power in space as weakening the world's efforts to keep arms out of the heavens. Opposition to nuclear projects in Earth orbit grew stronger after the Soviet Union disclosed last May that it had lost radio contact with the nuclear-powered Cosmos 1900, the third such episode in a decade. Although an automatic safety system ejected and boosted the craft's reactor into a higher and thus safer orbit on Oct. 1, the last-ditch effort occurred only after the crippled satellite had frightened much of the world for months with the specter of a fiery re-entry that would scatter radioactive debris far and wide. Last month, Representative George E. Brown Jr., a California Democrat, introduced a bill to promote an East-West ban on nuclear power in orbit. ''A major catastrophe has been avoided in large part because only a few percent of today's spacecraft have a nuclear power source on board,'' he said in a statement. ''But there could well be hundreds of nuclear reactors circling the globe in the 21st century. How lucky will we be then?'' Mindful of public apprehension, atomic scientists are moving to increase the reliability of such systems and to publicize their precautions. Dennis A. Bitz, deputy assistant secretary for space and defense power systems at the Energy Department, told a Congressional hearing last month that safety is ''our number one priority'' and outlined steps being taken to reduce the risks of a new type of nuclear reactor that is to be launched in the mid-1990's and is intended to become the nation's standard reactor for a variety of missions. So too, the Soviets this month demonstrated new attention to safety with their successful last-minute boosting of the reactor from the doomed nuclear satellite. A decade ago, another Soviet satellite, Cosmos 954, carrying no such back-up system, plunged unexpectedly back to Earth, spreading thousands of bits of radioactive debris across Canadian soil. Use in Spy Satellites Pioneered by the United States in 1961, nuclear power in space has been used mainly for specialized missions to distant planets where there is insufficient sunshine to power solar panels. Closer to Earth, Soviet spy satellites that skim the atmosphere rely on compact reactors rather than large solar arrays, which would slow the low-flying craft and shorten their already short lifetimes. Over the years, the Soviet Union has launched 33 spy satellites that get their power for ship-tracking radars from the hot reactions of uranium-235 atoms undergoing controlled nuclear fission. In a different process,the Soviets have also used the relatively cooler, natural heat from the radioactive decay of nuclear materials to generate power on at least four other spacecraft. The United States has launched one satellite with a uranium-fueled experimental reactor and 22 craft carrying 37 heat generators, which are powered by plutonium-238. These American devices have helped power key missions, including the Moon landings and probes of Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. The Voyager 2 spacecraft, in space for more than a decade and now more than two billion miles from Earth, next year is to radio back pictures of Neptune. The probe's electronic systems are powered by a natural heat generator. So too, the newly revived shuttle program is scheduled to launch the Galileo probe toward Jupiter next year, energized by a heat generator. Nuclear Mission to Mars In the future, nuclear reactors will be larger and more powerful. The powerpack on Galileo will generate 570 watts of electricity, barely enough to warm a kitchen toaster. Reactors on Soviet spy satellites are said to generate five to ten kilowatts. In contrast, future reactors now being readied are to generate tens and hundreds of kilowatts or even megawatts of electricity, vastly increasing the range of potential uses. The Soviet Academy of Sciences recently disclosed plans for a manned Mars spaceship, its main engines powered by nuclear energy. Although the Soviets have revealed no details of the proposed craft or its thrust mechanism, experts say the likely method is ion propulsion, which uses a reactor to ionize some heavy fuel like mercury and accelerate it out the craft's rear, providing thrust. Both superpowers have tested such engines experimentally in space. And the National Aeronautics and Space Administration foresees space stations, as well as Moon and Mars outposts, that will rely on nuclear power for manufacturing, science experiments and life support. Robert Rosen, deputy associate administrator for aeronautics and space technology at NASA, said manned bases on the Moon and Mars could be critically dependent on nuclear power, especially ''at sites with extended night periods'' where solar arrays have little value. At the request of the Air Force, the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico recently started to study nuclear rocket engines, which are seen as cheaper and more efficient than conventional chemical rockets. The goal is to build atomic-powered space tugs that would ferry payloads from orbits near the Earth to more distant locations. Dangers in Earth Orbit Finally, atomic energy could be an important source of power for space weapons. Last year, an expert panel of the American Physical Society, after studying secret Federal documents, reported that some potential plans for anti-missile systems call for a hundred or more orbiting reactors to energize space-based weapons, radars and sensors. Critics of nuclear systems in space often grudgingly support atomic-powered scientific probes of deep space but strongly oppose the proliferation of reactors in Earth orbit. ''The new generation of nuclear power supplies represents a very large increase in power level and operating lifetime, and hence in associated risk,'' said Steven Aftergood, director of the Committee to Bridge the Gap, a private group, based in Los Angeles, that monitors nuclear space technologies. For example, he said, the worst possible accident with a Soviet nuclear-powered spy satellite might produce radioactive debris on Earth that could cause hundreds of fatal cancers, according to some risk estimates, while a catastrophic failure of the new American reactor planned for the 1990's could trigger tens of thousands of cancer deaths. Although Federal officials challenge such estimates, the existence of these public disputes, coupled with the fact that atomic power in space has experienced multiple failures over the decades, is helping prompt a new emphasis on safety. Insuring Dispersion The Soviets modified their spy satellites after radioactive debris from Cosmos 954 fell across northern Canada. Before and after the accident, the Soviets' plan for disposing of spent reactors was to separate them from the spacecraft flying about 150 miles above the Earth and boost them with rocket thrusters to an orbit 590 miles high. The idea is that dangerous radioactivity would decay over the hundreds of years it would take the satellite to spiral back to Earth. Soon after the satellite failure over Canada in 1978, the Soviets began a new procedure whereby the reactor, after reaching its ''graveyard'' orbit, would eject its radioactive core. Thus, if the boosting maneuver ever failed, this precaution would allow the core to separate while still in low-Earth orbit, insuring its dispersion rather than having the satellite body act as a heat shield to keep parts of the core intact down to the surface of the Earth. Indeed, this maneuver worked in 1983 when an errant spy satellite, Cosmos 1402, failed to boost its reactor. The core and other parts instead were scattered in the atmosphere. During this year's crisis, a new problem was the loss of radio contact, which deprived Soviet ground controllers of the opportunity to even try to boost Cosmos 1900's reactor into a higher orbit. But as the errant satellite spiraled closer and closer to Earth, falling to an altitude of 100 miles, an automatic, last-ditch safety system was activated after positioning jets on the craft ran out of fuel. It was this automatic system, previously unknown in the West, that triggered the boosting maneuver. In recent Congressional testimony, American officials have said repeatedly that their safety precautions for space reactors are much better than those of the Soviets. Designed to Survive Re-entry The focus of their assertions is the SP-100, a prototype space reactor meant to generate 100 kilowatts of electricity and fit into the cargo bay of the space shuttle. According to the General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress, the project could cost as much as $1.8 billion. Under joint development by NASA, the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense, the reactor is to be built by the General Electric Company and first launched in the mid-1990's. Government officials say the orbits of spacecraft powered by the SP-100 will generally be much higher than those of the Soviet spy satellites, eliminating the need for complex boosting maneuvers. And if for some reason the reactor should prematurely re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, it is designed to survive the fiery descent in one piece, rather than scattering radioactive debris through the atmosphere. In addition, the reactor design has recently been changed to include other safety features. ''In each case these features were incorporated even though they might be considered as a weight penalty to the design,'' Mr. Bitz, the Energy Department official, recently told a Congressional hearing. Despite such precautions, some space experts question the wisdom of putting an ever increasing number of reactors in Earth orbit, saying the plans can be greatly complicated by new risks. For instance, the growing amount of space debris circling the Earth - at last count, more than 7,200 objects the size of a baseball or larger - increase the chance of a spent reactor being hit and fragmented into a million tiny pieces. This cloud of new debris could dramatically increase the risk of still more collisions with spacecraft. 'Grim Picture' ''Two things have happened in the past decade,'' said Nicholas L. Johnson, a scientist at Teledyne Brown Engineering in Colorado Springs, who studies the debris problem for the Government. ''The space environment has continued to deteriorate and our understanding of it has gotten better. The result is a grim picture.'' Mr. Johnson estimated that 1.6 tons of reactor fuel have already been put into Earth orbit over the years, and that the chance of a collision with such material becomes ''a virtual certainty'' as the number of satellites and amount of space debris continue to rise. Partly because of such emerging threats, moves to restrict reactors in space often seek to ban nuclear devices in Earth orbit but permit them aboard deep-space probes, like manned missions to Mars. In addition, some critics of space power say Earth-orbiting reactors are a menace because they would largely be used by the military. ''The primary applications of nuclear power in orbit are in themselves a provocation and a threat,'' said Mr. Aftergood of the Committee to Bridge the Gap. He added that his group supported a ban on the use of nuclear power in orbit ''while permitting the peaceful use of nuclear power in future deep space missions.'' Atom Power in Space American and Soviet officials plan an increase in nuclear reactors in space for a host of projects such as the proposed space station, left. Reactors provide greater energy than solar and chemical sources. New type of reactor, SP-100, right, is being built by United States to power space arms, satellites or Moon and Mars bases. Soviet Manned Mars Ship The Soviets plan a manned Mars mission powered by nuclear engines. Experts say the likely method is ion propulsion, which uses a reactor to ionize heavy fuel like mercury and accelerate it out the craft's rear, providing thrust. Both superpowers have used such engines experimentally in space. Probe to Jupiter The Galileo Jupiter probe, to be launched next year by the American space shuttle, has a plutonium power source that, unlike a nuclear reactor, uses the natural heat of radioactive decay to power equipment. Probes to the distant planets have long used plutonium power sources because",1988-10-18T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,science

The steam turbine at the plant, which at its peak could make enough electricity for about half a million homes with virtually no greenhouse gas emissions, will grind to a halt. Vermont Yankee, in the river town of Vernon near the Massachusetts border, had been the target of years of protests and lawsuits by state officials, environmentalists and others concerned about safety and radioactive waste. But in the end, the antinuclear movement didn’t kill the plant. Economics did. “People are always surprised when we say that really wasn’t the driver in shutting it down,” said Bill Mohl, the president of a division of Entergy Corporation that operates Vermont Yankee and four other nuclear plants, including Indian Point north of New York City. Although Vermont Yankee produced power inexpensively, was upgraded recently and was licensed to operate until 2032, the plant had become unprofitable in recent years, a victim largely of lower energy prices resulting from a glut of natural gas used to fire electricity plants, Mr. Mohl said. To its advocates, nuclear power is a potent force for fighting climate change, combining the near-zero emissions of wind and solar energy with the reliability of coal and gas. And nuclear power, which provides about 19 percent of all electricity in the United States and 11 percent worldwide, could be a greater source. But as Vermont Yankee illustrates, the nuclear industry in the United States is having trouble maintaining the status quo, much less expanding. “It’s going nowhere quickly,” said Sharon Squassoni, who studies energy and climate change at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Overseas, the outlook is not much better. In addition to market forces, enormous design and construction costs, questions about new federal emissions rules, uncertainty about the long-term storage of waste fuel, and public perceptions about safety after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan have all had an effect on the American nuclear industry. Of the roughly 100 reactors in operation in the United States, four others have been permanently shut since 2012 because of market economics or the costs of repairs or safety improvements, and half a dozen or more are in jeopardy, industry analysts say. Safety concerns may eventually scuttle others close to large populations, including Indian Point. Beyond five reactors under construction, few if any others are likely to be built anytime soon. And progress on a new generation of smaller, less expensive and potentially safer reactors has been slow. Given that most of the still-profitable plants will reach the end of their useful lives by midcentury or sooner, it appears likely that nuclear power will play a diminishing role in the United States. “We’re going to be hard pressed just to replace those,” Ms. Squassoni said. All of this is encouraging to opponents of nuclear power, who are concerned about the costs, the potential for a major accident — despite the industry’s relatively good safety record — and the hazards of storing spent fuel. “These things are extremely expensive and prone to cost overruns,” said Grant Smith, the senior energy policy analyst with the Civil Society Institute , a Massachusetts research group that advocates solutions to climate change. “The high-level nuclear waste issue has never been addressed. You’re talking about indefinite costs into the future.” But the outlook for nuclear power dismays the industry and its supporters, including some environmentalists, who point out that replacing the lost electricity from Vermont Yankee and the other recently closed reactors with power from natural gas could result in the release of as much carbon dioxide as is produced yearly by two million cars or more. “We can’t take a carbon-free source of energy off the table,” said Carol M. Browner, a former head of the Environmental Protection Agency who is now with Nuclear Matters , an industry-backed group. Overseas, some nations have retrenched from nuclear power, out of necessity or by choice. Japan shut its 50 reactors for inspections and safety improvements after Fukushima, and although two were restarted briefly, all still remain shut down and not all are expected to reopen. Germany will eventually close all 17 of its reactors as part of an ambitious transition to renewable energy. Even China, with more than two dozen nuclear plants under construction, faces uncertainties. If the country is able to exploit its abundant reserves of shale gas, its nuclear plans may be derailed, Ms. Squassoni said. An even bigger question is whether China’s current rate of economic growth is going to continue. “If it doesn’t, what is that going to do to its energy demand?” she said. The impetus for developing more nuclear power may dissipate. To people in the American nuclear industry, reactors do not get the respect they deserve for being both virtually emissions-free and a source of around-the-clock electricity for the grid. Experts point to the spell of extreme cold weather across much of the country last January, when nuclear plants kept working while many gas and coal plants had to shut down as the cold affected equipment and fuel supplies. About half of the nuclear plants sell their electricity in competitive wholesale markets, which are relatively new and complex. Electricity from generators fueled by low-cost gas is priced so low that nuclear plants cannot compete, industry analysts say, and the markets also offer advantages to new power sources, especially wind turbines, over existing sources like nuclear and coal. “The markets are quite simply not working,” said Richard J. Myers, the vice president for policy development at the Nuclear Energy Institute , an industry group. The industry is pushing for changes that would help marginal plants stay in operation. Federal price supports would be one, perhaps temporary, solution. Another would be to grant a premium to power sources, like nuclear, that can keep running under almost any circumstances. “All of this is fixable,” Mr. Myers said. “The question is: Do the fixes come quickly enough?” Other help could come as the federal government and the states develop policies under new carbon-emission rules for the power industry that were proposed by the E.P.A. in June in its Clean Power Plan . They could lead to the development of new programs, and expansion of existing ones, that put a price on greenhouse gas emissions as a means of limiting them. “The biggest thing that is going to drive people to clean solutions is going to be a cap on carbon,” said Christine Todd Whitman, a former New Jersey governor and E.P.A. head who is now an industry advocate. The industry’s recent struggles represent something of a reversal from the previous decade, when there was talk of a nuclear revival in the United States after nearly 30 years without any new reactor construction permits being issued. Even then, however, some experts questioned just how much nuclear power could grow in the United States and abroad, and how much it could contribute to the effort to reduce carbon emissions. In a report she prepared in 2009, Ms. Squassoni wrote that in light of steep construction costs, only a handful of new reactors would come on line by 2015, even in the best of circumstances. “If you really wanted to reduce carbon emissions through nuclear, it was going to be incredibly expensive,” she said. “You’d have to build an incredible number of power plants.” Now plants are even more expensive, in part because of new safety requirements in the wake of Fukushima. So-called small modular reactors have been proposed as a lower-cost alternative. There are many different designs — at least one is meant to run on waste fuel — but the federal Department of Energy has provided significant development money only for two designs that are smaller variations of the most common kind of reactor. Ashley Finan, an analyst with the Clean Air Task Force , which focuses on technologies to fight climate change, said that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had not made it easy for alternative designs to win backing from private investors. “There’s a lack of a clear and predictable regulatory pathway,” Dr. Finan said. “You’re really not able to attract funding without a clear regulatory process.” As a result, small modular reactors are many years from reality in the United States. Overseas, there are only a few isolated small-reactor projects underway, including one under construction in China. Most modular designs have features that are intended to make them safer than existing reactors. Safety, as always, looms large in the debate about nuclear power. Although some watchdog groups point to incidents like leaks of radioactive water from some plants, the industry in the United States promotes its safety record, noting that events like unplanned reactor shutdowns are at historical lows. And the American industry’s one major accident, at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979, pales in comparison with Fukushima or the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union. But Peter A. Bradford, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that in discussions of adding more nuclear power to help curb emissions and fight climate change, the issue of safety takes on a new dimension. “You can’t rationally bet a big part of your climate change abatement plan on a technology that you may suddenly find you don’t want to use anymore,” Mr. Bradford said. A major accident, for example, might force the entire industry to shut down, at least temporarily. “There’s no other low-carbon alternative with the potential to develop a large hole like that.”",2014-12-23T00:18:24.000+01:00,NYTIMES,science-science

The authority announced that John C. Brons, its president since March 1991, would resign immediately and would be replaced for the time being by Robert G. Schenberger, who had been executive vice president for finance and administration. Meanwhile, during a visit to the authority's Indian Point 3 nuclear plant here, the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that his agency would propose another $300,000 in civil penalties for the plant, which paid $462,500 in fines last year. 'Lack of Enthusiasm' ""There is nothing intrinsically dangerous, unsafe or particularly hard to operate about these power plants,"" said the chairman, Ivan Selin. But he said that Power Authority managers had until recently shown a ""lack of enthusiasm"" for solving the problems at Indian Point 3, including a large backlog of maintenance, that added up to a pattern of declining safety. He added, however, that management was now acknowledging the extent of its problems. Indian Point 3, which has one of the worst records for reliability in the United States, has been closed since February because of managerial problems. The chairman of the Power Authority, Richard M. Flynn, said at a news conference after Mr. Selin's tour that there were no deadlines for re-starting the reactor. ""I am not interested in dates; my commitment is to safety,"" he said. He said that the plant might reopen ""in the fall or early winter."" The authority supplies municipal entities, including the Metropolitan Transit Authority and the New York City government, with electricity below commercial rates. The region has no shortage of electricity, but plants like Indian Point have high fixed costs, so long shutdowns eventually affect rates. Falling Performance In performance assessments by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and industry groups, and in measures like amount of power produced, the authority's reactors have fallen from near the top to near the bottom, Mr. Flynn said. ""I stand foursquare behind the principle of accountability,"" Mr. Flynn said. He said Mr. Brons, whose salary was $196,529, had ""agreed to step aside."" Before he was president, Mr. Brons was vice president for nuclear generation, and before that, was resident manager at Indian Point 3. Mr. Flynn said that Mr. Brons, who is 55, would be available for consulting with the authority for a year, and then might retire. He also said that the Power Authority's board would hire two outside experts, either executives of other utilities or recently retired executives, to advise the board directly on the authority's nuclear operations. The authority's other nuclear plant, the James A. FitzPatrick reactor in Scriba, N.Y., has been described by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as one of the reactors most in need of extra attention from the commission. The authority also said that it would centralize responsibility for its nuclear plants under Ralph E. Beedle, the executive vice president for nuclear generation. He will report to Mr. Schenberger and to the board of directors' new nuclear advisors, Mr. Flynn said. Mr. Beedle, who is 53, was in the United States Navy's nuclear program for 21 years and then worked at the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations, an industry group based in Atlanta that tries to improve the operations of utility reactors. Mr. Selin, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission chairman, did not say precisely what the new penalties were for. Earlier this year, at the beginning of an intensive review of the plant by the commission's staff, Federal officials discussed one case in which operators had installed a system to increase cooling in the reactor if the regular shutdown system failed, but which had not been tested and in fact would not have worked properly. In another case, technicians tested a pump that in an emergency was supposed to deliver to the reactor a mixture of water and boric acid that would choke off the nuclear chain reaction. The results of the test showed that the pump had failed, but the technicians and several supervisors who saw the results had re-started the reactor without recognizing that fact.",1993-06-08T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

The revelation came in comments by the president of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, made to state-run television and reported by the semiofficial Fars news agency. He was dismissing speculation that the arrival of the fuel would allow Iran to halt its uranium enrichment program, in Natanz. “We are building a 360-megawatt indigenous power plant in Darkhovein,” he said, referring to a southern city north of Bushehr. “The fuel for this plant needs to be produced by Natanz enrichment plant,” he added, Fars said. Bushehr and Darkhovein were both projects planned before the 1979 Revolution. It was not clear how much construction had been done at Darkhovein. The location is also sometimes spelled Darkhovin, or referred to by other nearby place names, including Ahvaz, Esteghlal and Karun. Mr. Aghazadeh said Monday that Iran needed to increase the centrifuges at the Natanz enrichment plant from 3,000 to 50,000, saying that with 50,000, it could only produce fuel for a 100-megawatt plant. The White House had signaled Monday that the arrival of the fuel could help convince Iran to curb its enrichment program. President Bush said that if Iran accepted the uranium for a civilian power plant, “there was no need for them to learn how to enrich,” Reuters reported. Mr. Aghazadeh said the shipment was made after an agreement was reached between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, during his visit in October to Tehran. Construction of Bushehr has been hindered by repeated delays. Earlier this year Russia delayed a fuel shipment expected in March, accusing Iran of tardiness in making its monthly payments of $25 million. However, Western officials said Russia made the decision in part to help the West pressure Iran into more openness on its nuclear program. Last week, Sergei Shmatko, the director of Atomstroyexport, announced that Russia and Iran had ended their financial disputes over the project, though he failed to indicate a date for when the long-awaited opening would occur. Atomstroyexport is the Russian contractor on the project. Irina Esipova, a spokeswoman for Atomstroyexport, said the plant would be technically ready to operate no sooner than six months after all the uranium fuel rods needed to power the station were delivered. Mr. Aghazadeh said Monday that almost 95 percent of the work at Bushehr was finished and that it could produce power as early as the next Iranian year, which begins on March 21. “The first phase of delivery has been completed,” said Ms. Esipova. “A small amount of fuel is already on the premises of the Bushehr station in a special storage facility.” The company plans to deliver about 80 tons of nuclear fuel to Iran over the next two months, she said. The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the fuel would be under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency and that Iran had given written guarantees that the fuel would only be used for the nuclear power plant. “All fuel that will be delivered will be under the control and guarantees of the International Atomic Energy Agency for the whole time it stays on Iranian territory,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “Moreover, the Iranian side gave additional written guarantees that the fuel will be used only for the Bushehr nuclear power plant.” The statement added, “After the Russian fuel is processed at the Bushehr nuclear power plant, it will be returned to Russia for further processing and storage.” The power station is at the heart of an international dispute over Iran’s nuclear program. Iran insists that Bushehr is part of a civilian nuclear program. However, critics, particularly in the United States and Western Europe, have accused Tehran of secretly developing or planning to develop a nuclear bomb. The United States released a National Intelligence Estimate two weeks ago concluding that Tehran had ended its nuclear weapons program in 2003, undermining earlier claims by the Bush administration that Iran was actively developing a nuclear weapon. Officials in Washington have nevertheless continued to insist that Iran remains a threat, sentiments which have been echoed by some European leaders. Iran considers itself to have been vindicated by the intelligence report. On Sunday, Mr. Ahmadinejad called the nuclear issue his “toughest battle and challenge” in recent years, but said the intelligence report had lifted Iran’s international status, a statement on the Web site of Iran’s Foreign Ministry said.",2007-12-18T06:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,world

In trying to stop the spread of nuclear arms, the U.S. has tried hard to keep such plutonium and uranium out of the hands of would-be bomb-makers. That becomes harder to do as more and more nuclear material is produced. The obvious answer is to ban the production of any more weapons-grade uranium or plutonium and deplete the world's existing stocks. Until recently the U.S. and its allies have hesitated to take such a step, believing that they might run out of uranium to fuel their nuclear power plants and would need to rely on plutonium. That fear is no longer valid. Nuclear power plants can be fueled with either uranium or plutonium. Uranium fuel, which is used in all but a handful of the world's nuclear plants, is no threat. It has to be enriched to be used in a bomb. Indeed, bomb-making is the only reason to produce highly enriched uranium. So stopping such enrichment is a problem only for potential proliferators. Unfortunately, plutonium is a tougher case. The very same plutonium used to fuel nuclear power plants can also be used to make nuclear arms. Plutonium does not exist in nature, but can be extracted from the spent fuel in nuclear reactors by means of reprocessing. France and Britain have invested heavily in new plants to reprocess plutonium. And energy-starved Japan is contemplating plutonium as an almost unlimited source of fuel for power plants. But breeder reactors to produce the plutonium have proved difficult to develop. The need for plutonium fuel has receded. As Russia dismantles its nuclear arms, the world will be awash in uranium -- enough to fuel all the nuclear power plants now planned or in operation for at least 50 years. President Clinton would be prudent to make a global ban on production of fissile materials a centerpiece of his nonproliferation policy.",1993-07-10T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,opinion

The measures, approved at the end of a three-day conference on the lessons of the Soviet nuclear plant disaster, was immediately signed by representatives of 49 of the agency's 114 member countries. The proposed agreements are part of a 13-point program proposed here last month at an international conference at which the Soviet Union presented its report on the accident at the Chernobyl power plant. The other proposals included international standards for fire and radiation protection at nuclear plants. Western experts have said they are less certain about the propects for approval of the other proposals. The principal convention signed today requires member countries to provide immediate detailed information on any radioactive leak likely to affect other nations. Civil and Military Accidents It applies to accidents at all civil and most military nuclear installations. At Soviet and American insistence, leaks from weapons and underground test explosions are excluded. But both countries, as well as the other nuclear powers, say they will notify of such accidents on a voluntary basis. Signing the two conventions on behalf of the United States, Energy Secretary John S. Herrington said they created ''a cooperative framework in which all nations may participate in order to minimize dangers in the event of another nuclear accident.'' Mr. Herrington called for further efforts to improve safety at nuclear power plants throughout the world and said he was not yet satisfied the Soviet Union had done enough to make its Chernobyl plant secure. ''We are still awaiting answers to nearly 600 technical questions sent them about the modifications they are making.'' Mr. Herrington said he was still ''concerned'' about the Soviet Union's decision to restart two of the undamaged reactors at the Chernobyl power station. ''They have not had time to install the new safety hardware they promised,'' he said. Signed by Soviet Union The Soviet Union also signed the agreements approved here today. In the final declaration of the conference, attended by representatives of 94 of the agency's members, delegates said nuclear power ''will continue to be an important source of energy for social and economic development.'' They also said individual countries remained responsible for the safety of their civil nuclear installations, but they called in general terms for greater international cooperation on security questions through the agency, the main world organization overseeing nuclear energy. More than 270 nuclear power reactors are operational in the world. More than 100 others are under construction, according to agency figures. The conference reached a consensus today only after agreeing that the agency should discuss the views of dissenting nations at future meetings. On Paying Damages Several members at this week's conference urged that countries sustaining a nuclear accident should be held liable in international law to pay for the damage they cause. The Soviet Union admitted that it has ''moral responsibility'' for the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster, but it denied any legal obligations. Sweden, Denmark, Luxembourg and Ireland - the four European countries with the deepest distrust of nuclear energy - want the I.A.E.A. to draft a new treaty requiring all countries to consult with their neighbors on the safety of nuclear plants they plan to build. After the Israeli attack on an Iraqi reactor, many developing countries also want a new treaty banning acts of war against civil nuclear installations. Finally, India and another group of developing countries are seeking binding obligations on the industrial world to supply poorer nations with nuclear technology. ---- Soviet Plant to Resume MOSCOW, Sept. 26 (Reuters) - The Soviet Union said today that it was ready to resume energy production at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported that one of the four reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in the Ukraine would begin operating ''within the next few days.'' The plant has been idle since April 26, when unauthorized experiments by workers led to a blast that tore open the fourth reactor, releasing a huge cloud of radiation. Pravda said the first and second units at the plant would start operating soon. Repairs are continuing on the third unit adjoining the stricken fourth reactor, it said. Pravda said last month that construction of a concrete tomb to encase the fourth reactor was proceeding too slowly. But today it said only the roof remained to be built and the tomb was expected to be completed within a matter of days.",1986-09-27T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,metropolitan-desk-new-york

Goldstein and Staffan A. Qvist (Feb. 10), Richard Rhodes correctly notes that nuclear power should be part of a future carbon-free energy mix. However, he doesn’t present quite enough of the math to fairly evaluate their proposal. First is the sheer number of reactors. Nathan Lewis at Caltech estimates that on the order of 20,000 new 1-GWe plants will be required to meet projected demands in the second half of the 21st century. Just 10 percent of Professor Lewis’s estimate still represents a lot of construction and an enormous amount of money. How does this actually happen? Second, who is going to build, operate and regulate these plants? Despite the disasters at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima, the commercial nuclear industry, clustered in the developed world, actually has been remarkably safe over its lifetime. Yet much of the developing world, where energy demand is growing most rapidly, struggles to deliver basic services such as clean water and human waste disposal. Are big, centrally located power plants the real solution for the energy demands of the developing world? These plants require clustered high demand and extensive transmission capacity; this is perhaps fine for megacities, but much of the demand in the developing world is dispersed and more efficiently served by distributed power sources such as wind and solar that can be delivered in stages as demand increases. Complex problems rarely have simple solutions. No doubt nuclear power can and will be deployed to address some of the energy needs of the developing world. However, should our efforts to reduce carbon emissions and meet global energy demands be vested in a single 20th-century technology? The future of the planet might be better served by working to develop next-generation power sources and the political will and private capital necessary to deploy them. RICHARD G. LITTLE TROY, N.Y. The writer is a visiting research scholar in disaster mitigation, industrial and systems engineering, at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. ♦ To the Editor: Richard Rhodes’s review conforms, not surprisingly, to his longstanding bias in favor of nuclear power. But he doesn’t get history right. The anti-nuclear-power movement did not arise from concerns about overpopulation. These movements were separate. In fact, the gap between the antinuclear movement, arguably the most spontaneous grass-roots movement in history, and other environmental groups and movements is both striking and instructive. LORNA SALZMAN BROOKLYN ♦ To the Editor: I grew up with Three Mile Island and the environmental movement of the 1970s, and I can assure you that concerns about storing and transporting radioactive material, not population density, was reason to be concerned about nuclear power plants. VIVIAN LOUISE WILLIAMS MEDIA, PA. The writer is an educational consultant to the Philadelphia Water Department. ♦ To the Editor: How can one write a review extolling the (many) virtues of nuclear energy without mentioning, much less dealing with, the problems of nuclear-waste disposal? My then home state of North Carolina welshed on its agreement to take its turn as a depository in a multistate nuclear-waste compact. Nevada has so far resisted plans for disposal at Yucca Mountain, although that may change since the leader of the Senate is no longer from that state. Even in Finland, which has created a secure repository, there remains the problem that nuclear waste is a threat for many millenniums. How do we communicate with our descendants, if they exist 10,000 years from now, about the menace we have left for them? There may be solutions to these problems, but waste disposal must be part of the balance when we consider the pros and cons of nuclear power. TOM ROWE MARINA DEL REY, CALIF. ♦ To the Editor: Richard Rhodes’s review attempted to consider why Americans reject nuclear power as a reasonable energy option to moderate climate change. One reason is that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is vulnerable because it is subject to partisan appointments, budget cuts and policy changes that threaten protocols that do not have great flexibility. The satire of a bumbling Homer Simpson as a nuclear plant worker plays out the endgame of nuclear annihilation to an audience terrified of a nuclear accident in a way that tickles us but does not dissolve our very real fear.

If things go according to the plans of EDF Energy, the British subsidiary of the French state-owned utility EDF, this verdant hillside overlooking the Bristol Channel in southwest England will be the site of two gigantic nuclear power stations — the first to be built in Britain since the mid-1990s. In a turnabout from the late 20th century, the British government is courting the nuclear industry. It wants low-carbon power to aid its goal, enshrined in law, of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050. About 18 percent of Britain’s power now comes from nuclear sources, but several of those aging plants are scheduled to be retired in the next few years along with pollution- belching coal-fired generators. The government has identified eight sites, all with existing nuclear facilities, where new ones might go. The Hinkley Point reactors would provide about 6 percent of Britain’s power supply — enough for five million homes. A visit to Hinkley Point makes one think EDF is serious. Workers in yellow uniforms and hard hats are starting preparations for the construction, which would take nine years, as they wait for a final go-ahead from the company and the government. “I’ve bet my career on it, so I think that it is pretty high,” Nigel Cann, Hinkley Point’s manager, said of the probability that the plants will be built. The final decision, perhaps early next year, will come down to whether the suppliers think they can control the costs and risks and how much the government is willing to do to build nuclear facilities that are low in carbon emissions but have other liabilities, including a risk of catastrophe and no satisfactory answer after decades about what to do with the toxic waste they produce. With British nuclear engineering talent dispersed after the completion of the last plant, known as Sizewell B, in 1995, Mr. Cann needs to reassemble a skilled work force and drill British construction firms on the high quality required for work on nuclear stations. EDF is pulling out every stop to make its case. Its planning application includes thousands of documents on topics including the dormitories that will house construction workers and the park-and-ride sites designed to reduce traffic on the narrow lanes around Hinkley Point. It is setting up a plan to buy properties in the Somerset village of Shurton from people who do not want to put up with years of disruption from the work. The company has even erected shelters to house bats and badgers that the project displaces. The nuclear industry also brings benefits for those around it. The operating Hinkley Point B reactor employs several hundred people from the area. Another 200 or so spend their days working on two 1950s-era Magnox reactors that look like big blue jack-o-lanterns. Those reactors were taken out of service in 2000 but still require decades of cleanup. Whether the new plants, known as Hinkley Point C, get the green light and, if so, how well they work out may have a huge effect on the future of the nuclear energy industry across the world. The shock waves from the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011 are still being felt. China is going ahead with its ambitious nuclear program, but Germany is abandoning nuclear power, and many countries that were once eager to harness the atom to meet their surging electricity needs are now wary, according to Mark Hibbs, a nuclear analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. France has long been a leading proponent of nuclear power, but the construction of early versions of a new generation of French-designed reactors called EPRs, which will be used at Hinkley Point, has hit snags and huge cost overruns at Olkiluoto in Finland and Flamanville in France. EDF is building two other EPRs at Taishan in China with China Guangdong Nuclear Power. EDF now operates eight nuclear plants in Britain, including one at Hinkley Point. The company hopes that success there will persuade not only Britain but other countries to sign up. Even EDF and its 20 percent partner, the British utility Centrica, say they cannot afford the huge capital costs of building a new nuclear plant without some assurances. Soaring cost estimates of as much as £7.5 billion, or $11.7 billion, for the plants mean the companies would not make a sufficient return on their investment at current electric prices, they say. The government now plans to guarantee revenue for nuclear plants through a mechanism by which they would be paid additional sums if electricity rates were below a certain floor. Analysts think that strike price will need to be at least £100 per megawatt-hour — about double the current British rate. The government says this would not be a subsidy, but it looks like one to critics. “You have to get the marketplace to a point where you have confidence that you can get a return on your money,” Mr. Cann said, while declining to put a figure on costs. In a blow to the government, the German utilities RWE and E.On said last spring that they would sell their stakes in another nuclear consortium, Horizon. A British utility, SSE, had previously pulled the plug, citing unquantifiable costs. The government is now hunting for replacements. Because there is no major British nuclear supplier, companies from abroad need to play major roles. Among the candidates are EDF’s partner, Guangdong Nuclear, and another Chinese company. The thinking — perhaps wishful — is that helping finance the British program would provide the Chinese industry with a high-profile opportunity to establish its credentials as a nuclear exporter. Jonathan Stern, a senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said the odds were against nuclear. “No one can take the commercial risks anymore,” he said. The lead times for nuclear power are so large, he argued, that other types of power, like offshore wind or plants fired by natural gas, will be built while the nuclear debate simmers. But others think nuclear will be needed to replace Britain’s badly aging generator fleet. “Nuclear investment is a high priority for the government,” said Charlotte Morgan, a nuclear expert at the law firm Linklaters. “There are few alternatives to deliver the U.K.’s long-term energy needs, its low-carbon commitments and security of supply.”",2012-08-08T14:04:13.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

The announcement mixed security warnings with longstanding complaints that Beijing was continuing to steal nuclear-related technology from American firms to benefit Chinese state-owned companies. In a call with reporters, however, administration officials revealed little of the intelligence evidence that they said would back up their claims. The move appeared to be part of a more concerted effort by the administration to put new pressure on China beyond the tariffs that President Trump has announced on Chinese goods. On Wednesday, the Trump administration said it would impose a new review system on foreign investments to prevent adversaries — chiefly China — from obtaining new technology by taking minority stakes in American companies or starting joint ventures here. Also on Wednesday, the Justice Department announced the arrest of a Chinese intelligence officer who was charged with stealing secret information from GE Aviation, one of the largest suppliers of jet engines. China has been an established nuclear weapons state since the early 1960s. While the Trump administration said it was acting to halt proliferation, the reality is that China is largely self-sufficient when it comes to developing nuclear weapons. The restrictions announced on Thursday appeared largely aimed at fears that advanced reactors, especially compact power plants that could fuel China’s ambitions to project power, would speed the emergence of the Chinese military as a force with global reach. The administration officials, who briefed journalists on the condition of anonymity, said Beijing was looking in particular to develop floating nuclear power reactors for use in the South China Sea, where it is building military instillations on reclaimed reefs. China is not a major customer for American nuclear technology; only about $170 million in nuclear-related sales went to Chinese customers last year. But the announcement on Thursday amounted to a significant setback in cooperative agreements that have had a checkered history since the Reagan administration. The first openings, noted Jeffrey A. Bader, the senior Asia specialist on President Barack Obama’s National Security Council, came as an incentive to stop Chinese cooperation with Pakistan, which was building its first nuclear weapons. Trade stopped after the Tiananmen Square uprising of 1989, and the Clinton administration had a major standoff with the Chinese over their help to Iran. But those issues were resolved, usually amid warnings from the American nuclear industry that failing to deal with China on nuclear issues was to open the way for France, Japan and South Korea to supply Beijing with nuclear technology. But today, Mr. Bader noted, “there is not much left in the American nuclear industry to harm, so the administration can indulge their most extreme-case suspicions.” There is little question that the Chinese have sought to steal nuclear-related technology: The United States has indicted Chinese hackers and insiders in a variety of cases that involved nuclear technology. Last year, Szuhsiung Ho, an American citizen born in Taiwan, was sentenced to two years in prison for organizing American nuclear experts to help China develop nuclear materials. That indictment named the China General Nuclear Power Company, the largest Chinese nuclear producer, which was seeking American designs for key components for nuclear reactors. The officials who briefed reporters, who came from three separate United States agencies with oversight of nuclear materials and technology, cited that case and others like it as they explained a new policy under which there would be a “presumption of denial” for Chinese licenses for certain advanced nuclear technologies. Older-style reactors, and common nuclear-related components, especially those widely available on global markets, will not be subject to the new restrictions. In a speech in July, Christopher Ford, the senior State Department official for nuclear issues, said that the “hard question” in dealing with China is to what extent the United States can participate in its growing nuclear market “without providing China with technological tools that will help it achieve its goal of seizing a geopolitical role for itself that displaces U.S. influence.” The administration said little on Thursday about how it pursued those goals. But the officials said that the new rules were based on a study conducted by the National Security Council that began last year, with heavy participation from intelligence agencies. But they would not say what intelligence findings, if any, justified the new restrictions. In the past, intelligence officials have noted that since China is already a nuclear-weapons state, denying the country nuclear technology made relatively little sense on national security grounds, unless there was a significant risk of proliferation. So instead, the administration based its decision, the officials said, on concerns about helping China extend the reach of its fleets — like nuclear-powered icebreakers or floating power plants that could be used to solidify China’s presence in the South China Sea, where it has claimed exclusive jurisdiction in areas around reefs that it reclaimed. Despite promises from President Xi Jinping of China that the islands would not be militarized, satellite photographs show runways and bunkers for fighter jets. A week ago, an American warship reported that it was forced off course by an extremely close encounter with a Chinese ship seeking to expel it from the area.",2018-10-12T01:26:19.000+02:00,NYTIMES,washington-world-asia-pacific

But more recently, that same gas boom has started pushing many of America’s nuclear reactors into early retirement — a trend with adverse consequences for climate change. The United States’ fleet of 99 nuclear reactors still supplies one-fifth of the country’s electricity without generating any planet-warming greenhouse gases. When those reactors retire, wind and solar usually cannot expand fast enough to replace the lost power. Instead, coal and natural gas fill the void, causing emissions to rise. Some environmental groups that have long been hostile to nuclear power are now having second thoughts. “We don’t support unlimited subsidies to keep these nuclear plants open,” said John Finnigan, lead counsel with the Environmental Defense Fund. “But we are concerned that if you close these plants today, they’d be replaced by natural gas and emissions would go up.” Faced with looming nuclear plant shutdowns, several states are considering a difficult and sometimes unpopular option: subsidizing their existing nuclear reactors to keep them running for years to come. In Pennsylvania, for instance, Exelon recently announced that it would close the last remaining reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant by 2019 unless policy makers stepped in to support it. Cheap natural gas had cut regional electricity prices in half, pushing Pennsylvania’s nine reactors, which produce one-third of the state’s power, toward unprofitability. State legislators have formed a “nuclear caucus” to explore policies to keep the plants open, studying recent moves by New York and Illinois to compensate nuclear operators for the carbon-free power they produce. Those in favor are motivated partly by climate concerns. “If Three Mile Island closes, we’d lose more zero-carbon power than all of the state’s renewable resources put together,” said John Raymond Hanger, a former Pennsylvania environmental secretary and an outside adviser to Exelon. Yet such policies still face staunch opposition from gas producers and even other environmentalists reluctant to subsidize a multibillion-dollar industry — making this one of the more contentious climate debates around. Since 2013, five nuclear power plants have been retired in Florida , Wisconsin , California , Vermont and Nebraska , the result of a mix of political opposition and competition from gas. Six more plants, including Three Mile Island and California’s Diablo Canyon, have announced that they will close between now and 2025, even though they could technically operate for decades. Those shutdowns would take enormous amounts of clean energy off the grid. The six retiring nuclear plants generated nearly 60 million megawatt-hours of electricity last year, more than all of America’s solar panels combined, according to an analysis by Environmental Progress, a green group pushing to save nuclear power. Several more plants in Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut are also at high risk of closing. A study by Geoffrey Haratyk of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that if all of the United States’ at-risk reactors shut down and were replaced by modern gas plants, domestic carbon dioxide emissions in the power industry would increase 4.9 percent — erasing a large portion of the recent climate gains from the decline of coal. “For a long time, we could have our cake and eat it, too, with cheap natural gas — it was driving down power prices and also lowering emissions,” said John Parsons, executive director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research at M.I.T. “But now that low gas prices are endangering nuclear plants, we’re facing a real trade-off between the economic benefits of cheap gas and hurting the planet.” And even if states eventually added enough renewable energy to offset lost nuclear, Mr. Parsons said, they would basically just be “running to stay in place,” rather than lowering emissions. Few companies are contemplating new nuclear plants to replace those lost, deterred by high costs and challenges in construction . And once an existing nuclear reactor is retired, it cannot be reopened later, as workers immediately begin removing fuel and decommissioning the plant. “If we close, we’re closed for good,” said Joseph Dominguez, an executive vice president at Exelon. The push to save nuclear power began in August when regulators in New York moved to subsidize three upstate nuclear plants in danger of closing by, in effect, compensating them for the zero-carbon power they produced. Officials concluded that New York could not meet its ambitious climate goals if those plants shut down. (Indian Point, a plant closer to New York City, will still close by 2021 .) In December, Illinois’s legislature passed a bill that both expanded support for renewable energy and created “zero emissions credits” to help two of Exelon’s financially troubled nuclear plants stay open. Several green groups supported the compromise, while coal and gas companies opposed it, noting that propping up nuclear would cut their market share. Those firms are challenging both states’ programs in court. Meanwhile, federal regulators are exploring changes to rules for wholesale electricity markets that could compensate nuclear plants for the benefits they provide, like zero-carbon electricity and fuel diversity. But, Mr. Dominguez said, federal changes alone would not suffice to save plants like Three Mile Island. Lawmakers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut are now mulling fresh policies to keep their endangered reactors operating. While some legislators are focused on air pollution concerns, others point to the jobs lost if those plants vanished. Still others worry about becoming overly dependent on a single fuel, natural gas, with a history of price volatility. Proponents of those subsidies argue that energy markets don’t properly value the low-carbon benefits that nuclear reactors provide — in contrast to wind and solar, which have been shielded from low electricity prices by state renewable mandates and federal tax credits. But opposition abounds. In Ohio, the American Petroleum Institute is waging a fierce campaign against a bill to subsidize the state’s two nuclear reactors. In Pennsylvania, a coalition of natural gas producers and manufacturers has railed against state subsidies. “Competitive markets are working well on behalf of consumers,” said Steve Kratz, a spokesman for Citizens Against Nuclear Bailouts. “Any effort to favor one industry over another would just cause electricity prices to increase and hurt everyone from ratepayers to large-scale manufacturers.” From a climate perspective, paying to keep existing nuclear plants open can be a relative bargain, analysts say, since the reactors have already been built and their capital costs are sunk. A paper by Michael Buchdahl Roth and Paulina Jaramillo of Carnegie Mellon University estimated that the country’s at-risk nuclear plants would require additional support of $8 to $44 per megawatt-hour of electricity produced to stay open, depending on the type of plant. For comparison, an analysis by Third Way, a centrist think tank, calculated that federal subsidies for wind power could be worth $20 to $29 per megawatt-hour, and support for solar worth $26 to $85 per megawatt-hour. While the prices of wind and solar keep falling, nuclear plants have the added benefit of running around the clock. Ultimately, experts say, the best solution would be for Congress to enact a nationwide price on carbon that put all zero-carbon energy on an equal footing . But until that happens, state efforts to prevent existing nuclear power from dying will be one of the biggest things policy makers can do to keep emissions down in the next decade. “All these fights trace back to the fact that current energy markets don’t value climate change properly,” said Alex Gilbert, an energy analyst who has studied nuclear retirements . “So states are essentially trying to find a backward way into carbon pricing,” first by subsidizing renewables, and now by trying to save nuclear. But, he added, “it’s a really messy way of getting there.”",2017-06-13T18:33:46.000+02:00,NYTIMES,national-climate

Nuclear Official Stepping Down,"The board of the Tennessee Valley Authority announced today that Steven A. White, the man who was hired to restart the agency's troubled and much-criticized nuclear program, would leave the agency in November. The board of the Tennessee Valley Authority announced today that Steven A. White, the man who was hired to restart the agency's troubled and much-criticized nuclear program, would leave the agency in November. Mr. White, a retired admiral and veteran of the nuclear Navy, had spent the last two and a half years as the T.V.A.'s nuclear power manager. He was hired to bring the agency's two completed but closed plants - one has now reopened - and six uncompleted plants up to safety standards after Federal regulators termed the plants among the ''worst'' in the country. End of Investigation Seen In Washington, Mr. White's lawyer, Gerald Charnoff, predicted that the Justice Department would drop an investigation into charges that Mr. White had lied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission about the safety readiness of one of the reactors he was hired to return to operation. ''Based on my evaluation of what there is to the case, it should come to an end very quickly and it should be successful for the T.V.A. and Admiral White,'' Mr. Charnoff said. The lawyer was hired by the agency to represent Mr. White. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's office of investigations had accused Mr. White, 59 year old, of falsifying reports to the N.R.C. about the safety assurance program at the power authority's closed Watts Bar nuclear plant near Spring City, Tenn. The commission referred the case to the Justice Department last October, asserting that Mr. White had made a ''material false statement'' when he certified in March 1986 that the Watts Bar reactor met Federal safety requirements. Mr. White's tenure has been rocky,marked by stiff criticism by the commission as well as Congress and by delays in the scheduled reopening of some plants. Only one plant, recently reopened, is operating, and another is scheduled to begin operating in six months. Marvin Runyon, chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, praised Mr. White for ''giving a strong foundation'' to the effort to reopen the plants and said that his departure had been expected as early as last March when he indicated he wanted to return to private life. Mr. Runyon, who took over leadership of the 55-year-old agency in January, has presided over sweeping changes and reorganizations, including decisions to indefinitely mothball some of the nearly completed nuclear plants. ''Adm. Steven White has provided the leadership for T.V.A.'s nuclear recovery efforts,'' said Mr. Runyon, ''but he's made clear his desire to return to his home and family in Charlottesville, Va.'' Mr. Runyon's announcement came at a press conference here, the headquarters city of the agency's nuclear power operations. Mr. White was not at the press conference and the chairman said that he was out of town supervising work on the plant scheduled to restart in six months. Replacement Named Mr. White will be replaced Nov. 1 by Oliver D. Kingsley Jr., who will become senior vice president for nuclear power, Mr. Runyon announced. Mr. Kingsley, who was at the news conference today, is currently a vice president of nuclear operations for a subsidiary of Middle South Utilities in Jackson, Miss. The board also named Warren R. Cobean Jr., a former Consolidated Edison official and director of the program making modifications in damaged systems at Three Mile Island, as an adviser on nuclear power plants. ''T.V.A.'s nuclear operation has problems as do most nuclear operations today,'' said Mr. Kingsley, who had supervised the refurbishing of the Grand Gulf nuclear plant to bring it up to Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards. ''Admiral White has brought us a long way, but I have no illusions about how tough this job will be.'' At the time that Mr. White was hired as a consultant under contract to the authority in January 1986, the T.V.A. had come under stiff criticism for a series of safety violations, allegations that it had ignored quality control standards in the construction and maintenance of the nuclear plants and charges of intimidating engineers who sought to blow the whistle. It was a low point for the agency. The T.V.A. saw five of its completed or nearly completed nuclear plants on the regulatory commission's ''worst'' plants list and had to cancel ambitious plans for nine additional plants when projections of electrical needs proved wrong and its operational capacity was questioned. Criticized Over Contract In his effort to rehabilitate the agency's operations and image, Mr. White almost immediately ran into criticism from Federal regulators for his $355,200 a year consulting contract with the agency and delays in making safety improvements, among other things. To date only one of the closed plants, Sequoyah 2, 18 miles north of here, has met regulatory requirements and is actually running after a number of false starts last spring. Six nearly completed plants are mothballed until 1991 or indefinitely. John Waters, another authority commissioner, acknowledged that Mr. White's period at the agency had been a rocky one, but insisted that the criticism he came under was mostly from critics of nuclear power. ''We are the second-largest nuclear power generator in the nation and the word among the anti-nuclear people was get Steven White and T.V.A. and you kill nuclear power,'' he said. ''I know how important T.V.A.'s success in nuclear recovery is to the success of nuclear power in the United States. Mr. Kingsley and Mr. Cobean, like Mr. White, are Navy veterans who first learned about nuclear energy in connection with nuclear submarines. Mr. Kingsley spent five years in the Navy's nuclear submarine program and was a senior reactor operator for the Alabama Power Company and manager of the company's Farley Nuclear Plant. He worked with the Southern Company, a owner of major utilities in the south and later Middle South Utilities. He is currently vice president of nuclear operations for Systems Energy Resources Inc., a Middle South subsidiary. Adviser to Work With Board Mr. Runyon said that Mr. Cobean, who will be a $100-an-hour adviser to the agency, would work with both the board and Mr. Kingsley in plotting the course of the nuclear program. Mr. Kingsley's salary and bonuses in his first year will be $217,300, and under a continuing bonus program, he could earn as much in subsequent years, Mr. Runyon said. Under his contract, Mr. White received $355,200 a year in salary and other perquisites, which included the cost of weekend commuting to his home.. Under the legislation that created the agency, salaries are capped at $77,300 a year. When Mr. White was hired on a consulting basis that provided him with additional pay, some in Congress complained that the cap was being illegally circumvented. But Alan Carmicheal, a spokesman for the T.V.A., said that the arrangement with Mr. Kingsley, with the inclusion of bonuses and incentives, was legal and did not violate the salary cap.",1988-09-08T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

We know that many environmentalists want Mr. Obama to put all of his chips on energy efficiency and renewable fuels, like wind and solar power. But nuclear power, which generates far fewer greenhouse gases than ordinary fossil fuels, should be part of the energy mix as this country and others move toward a less-carbon-intensive world. There are just more than 100 working nuclear plants in this country, supplying about one-fifth of the nation’s electricity. But a new plant has not been built here since the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island. While the United States has sat on the sidelines, other governments are enthusiastically embracing nuclear power as a way to lessen their greenhouse emissions and their dependence on imported oil. Several also rightly see nuclear technology as a strong export business. The nuclear industry’s safety record has improved since Three Mile Island. The next generation of plants  with advanced designs, new construction techniques and strong oversight  should be even safer. The biggest remaining obstacle has been financing. Nuclear reactors are very expensive. The tab for a new reactor can run as high as $7 billion to $8 billion, and overruns can add more. There is a long lead time before a plant starts selling power and paying returns. For these and other reasons, banks have not been willing to lend. It would be nice to think that the private sector could address this problem on its own. But the private sector does not underwrite the nuclear industry in other countries  governments do. And nothing is going to happen here without government loan guarantees. There are certainly financial risks. If the reactors are completed and operate profitably, the borrowers will repay the banks, in addition to an upfront fee to the federal government in exchange for the loan. If the project fails, the government  meaning the taxpayers  could be left holding a rather large bag. From where we sit, the risks are worth taking to get the United States back into the game, for the sake of the climate, this country’s energy future and the jobs a vibrant nuclear technology industry could create.",2010-02-18T06:59:47.000+01:00,NYTIMES,editorial-opinion

Workers at the Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station, on Lake Ontario about six miles from Oswego, were never in danger from a release of radiation, said the plant's operator and co-owner, the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation. But the problems at the Unit 2 reactor, the newest of the plant's two reactors, caused Niagara Mohawk to shut down the plant and declare the second-highest level of alert possible under Federal rules. And the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that the plant could not reopen until an investigation into the events, which began today, was completed. Niagara Mohawk lifted the alert at 7:45 P.M. It is only the third time that such an alert, known as a site area emergency, has occurred at an American nuclear power plant, the commission said. Parts of the monitoring systems were unaffected by the loss of power, enabling the operators to oversee the safe shutdown of the reactor. There were no failures to the reactor itself, officials said. According to the N.R.C., the operating record of Nine Mile Point's two nuclear reactors since the late 1980's has ranked among the worst of the 111 licensed nuclear reactors in the United States. For three years until June, Nine Mile Point was on the agency's list of problem plants. The incident today came as the Nine Mile Point plant was resuming a normal operating schedule after years of uncertainty. Reactors Were on Problem List Unit 1 was shut down in 1988 and placed on the Government's problem reactor list after an array of management, training, fire protection, and other structural weaknesses were identified by the N.R.C. It resumed operating in July 1990. Unit 2 was shut in 1989 because of an unusual number of unplanned emergency shutdowns. Unit 2 was also placed on the problem list. The reactor was restarted in March. Both reactors were removed from the problem list in June. Niagara Mohawk executives and the N.R.C. said the emergency was declared after one of three transformers at Unit 2 failed at 6 A.M. The failure caused a powerful surge of electricity to rush back into the plant, tripping the circuit breakers in the main turbine and five internal power systems. The turbine shutdown caused the nuclear reactor to automatically begin to shut itself down, plant engineers said today. Manual shutdown procedures also were started, they said. Four of the power systems that failed provided electricity to critical safety monitors, the plant's main computer, and monitoring equipment in the main control room. Some of the most important gauges operators use to control the reactor were knocked out, including the one showing the position of control rods in the reactor and another that measured the power of the reaction. Other emergency indicators that failed were annunciators, a series of playing-card-sized windows at the top of the control panel that flash and sound an alarm when something is working improperly. Their function is similar to that of red warning lights on an automobile's dashboard, serving as a first alert that can be verified by a gauge. The Unit 2 control room has up to 800 annunciators connected to monitors on pumps, valves, lubricating lines, steam lines, power packs, switch boxes and other equipment. The failure of many primary gauges, the main computer and annunciators meant that if the reactor were a car, operators would have been driving with a sheet across the windshield. The fifth power system controlled lighting in the plant, Niagara Mohawk spokesmen said. Niagara Mohawk and the N.R.C. said they considered the incident to be serious because the power systems had been designed so they would not fail. Each had backup batteries. In the event of a main electrical failure, the systems were supposed to automatically shift to battery power. The plant's engineers determined today that the power surge destabilized circuits that need to be stable for 4 milliseconds to work properly, said Gary Grant, a senior reactor operator. ""Nobody anticipated this transformer failure and all this happening at the same time,"" said Mr. Grant. A plant spokesman said that he did not know how many power systems are backed up by batteries, or how many systems exist besides the five that failed. Nine Mile Point is one of 37 nuclear plants in the country manufactured by the General Electric Company. Lynn Wallis, a spokesman for General Electric in San Jose, Calif, said today: ""The N.R.C. has evaluated our design. They are licensed and they are safe. That's all I can provide."" The Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station generates 1,705 megawatts of electricity for upstate New York residents from two boiling-water nuclear reactors. Unit 1, a 615-megawatt reactor wholly owned by Niagara Mohawk, began operating in 1969 and was not affected by the incident today. 5 Utilities Own Unit 2 Unit 2, a 1,080-megawatt reactor that began operating in 1988, is owned by Niagara Mohawk and four other utilities, including Long Island Lighting Company, New York State Electric and Gas Corporation, Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation and Central Hudson Gas and Electric. Late last month, Niagara Mohawk announced it was resuming quarterly dividend payments on its common stock at the end of August. Payments had been suspended for more than two years as the company's earnings suffered, in large part because of the cost of building Unit 2 and other problems at the plant. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission describes a site area emergency, one of four categories of alert, as one in which there are ""actual or likely major failures of plant functions needed for protection of the public."" The system of categorizing nuclear incidents began after the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Only twice before today have utilities declared site area emergencies. There has never been a general emergency, an actual or imminent degradation of the nuclear reactor core, though if the system had been in place in 1979, the Three Mile Island accident would have qualified. Last year, Plant Vogtle, a nuclear generating station owned and operated by the Georgia Power Company 26 miles southeast of Augusta, declared a site area emergency after the plant's main power supply failed. In 1982, a steam generating tube ruptured at the Ginna nuclear plant, operated by Rochester Gas and Electric 20 miles northeast of Rochester, and a similar emergency was declared because of the threat of a worse accident caused by the loss of coolant for the reactor core, said the N.R.C. The N.R.C. said today that emergency incidents at nuclear reactors in the United States are declining, , indicating an improvement in management and operations since 1979. Last year, the number of unusual events, the lowest level of alert, declined to 151 from a peak of 312 in 1985. In 1990, the number of alerts, the second lowest category, was 10, about the same as it had been for a decade. Niagara Mohawk said today that it took just 22 minutes for the plant to restore power to the control room monitors. The failure of battery-powered systems in nuclear plants is described by a a nuclear expert in San Jose, Calif., as a ""relatively rare"" event. According to data compiled by Steven Sholly, a risk analyst for MHB Technical Associates, a consulting firm, the chances of a failure of safety-related direct-current battery power in nuclear plant systems is one in 2,500 to one in 100,000 after an incident.",1991-08-14T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,front-page

In the foreground, though, sits a less obvious attraction: one of China's first nuclear power reactors, and just behind it, another being rushed toward completion. There are countless ways to show how China is climbing the world's economic ladder, hurdling developed countries in its path, but few are more pronounced than the country's rush into nuclear energy -- a technology that for environmental, safety and economic reasons most of the world has put on hold. In its anxiety to satisfy its seemingly bottomless demand for electricity, China plans to build reactors on a scale and pace comparable to the most ambitious nuclear energy programs the world has ever seen. Current plans -- conservative ones, in the estimation of some people involved in China's nuclear energy program -- call for new reactors to be commissioned at a rate of nearly two a year between now and 2020, a pace that experts say is comparable to the peak of the United States' nuclear energy push in the 1970's. ''We will certainly build more than one reactor per year,'' said Zhou Dadi, director of the central government's Energy Research Institute, which has strongly supported the country's nuclear program. ''The challenge is not the technology. The barriers for China are mostly institutional arrangements, because reactors are big projects. What we need most is better operation, financing and management.'' By 2010, planners predict a quadrupling of nuclear output to 16 billion kilowatt-hours and a doubling of that figure by 2015. And with commercial nuclear energy programs dead or stagnant in the United States and most of Europe, Western and other developers of nuclear plant technology are lining up to sell reactors and other equipment to the Chinese, whose purchasing decisions alone will determine in many instances who survives in the business. France, which derives about a third of its energy from nuclear power, is the only Western country committed to a large-scale nuclear energy program. It is in a building lull now, but will need to begin replacing aging reactors within a decade or so. Japan derives about 10 percent of its energy from nuclear sources and was once among the most favorably disposed toward nuclear energy. But a string of scandals involving comically shoddy practices, like mixing radioactive materials in a bucket, and near accidents have turned public opinion in many areas strongly antinuclear. That leaves China as the only potential growth area for nuclear energy. And for China, which still derives as much as 80 percent of its electricity from burning coal, the lure of nuclear energy is as obvious as the thick, acrid, choking haze that hangs over virtually all the country's cities. The problem with nuclear power, some experts say, is that China's energy needs are so immense -- each year, by some estimates, the country plans to add generating capacity from all sources equivalent to the entire current energy consumption of Britain -- that even the enormous expansion program will do little to offset the skyrocketing power demand. China's eight nuclear reactors in operation today supply less than 2 percent of current demand. By 2020, assuming the national plan is fulfilled, nuclear energy would still constitute under 4 percent of demand. There has been almost no public discussion of the merits and risks of nuclear energy here, as the government strictly censors news coverage of such issues. But critics question whether such a small payoff warrants exposure to the risk of catastrophic failures, nuclear proliferation, terrorism and the still unresolved problems of radioactive waste disposal. ''We don't have a very good plan for dealing with spent fuel, and we don't have very good emergency plans for dealing with catastrophe,'' said Wang Yi, a nuclear energy expert at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. ''The nuclear interest group wants to push this technology, but they don't understand the risks for the future. They want to make money. But we scientists, we want to take a very comprehensive approach, including safety, environment, dealing with waste and other factors, and not rush into anything.'' Chinese nuclear operators, like the people who run the Daya Bay plants here, scoff at such concerns. ''In China we have state-owned power companies, whereas abroad they have private companies,'' said Yu Jiechun, a senior engineer at the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Holding Company. ''It's not a matter of someone's profit here, whether we do something one way or another. The government decides, and they have spent huge amounts of money on safety.'' The government is also looking into a new generation of ''pebble bed'' reactors that some scientists say are far safer than traditional designs, though these are not a part of its immediate plans. One sure sign of the Chinese industry's self-assuredness is the promotion of the Daya Bay plants as a tourist attraction. For now -- in a country where surging power demand has led major cities like Shanghai to force companies to stagger working hours, shut down during the week and operate on weekends -- the public is likely to support anything that promises more electricity. American experts, mindful of the destructive consequences of the near catastrophic accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in 1979, warn against overconfidence. ''In 1970 we had a net capability of 7 million kilowatt hours, and by 1981 we had reached 56 million kilowatt hours,'' said John Moens, a nuclear analyst at the United States Department of Energy. ''So the rate of growth they propose is not only conceivable, it has been done before. The problem is, can you regulate it? Can you deal with the environmental problems? Can you deal with the hundred different things that creep up, as the Japanese found when they expanded their industry, just as we found when we expanded ours?'' Reinforcing this point, David Lochbaum, a nuclear energy expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private, nonprofit group based in Cambridge, Mass., said that of the 103 reactors in operation in the United States, 27 have been shut down for at least a year since September 1984. Daya Bay's location less than 50 miles from Hong Kong, where the proximity has become a political issue, only reinforces the environmental and safety concerns. That may sound like ample space, but it is not much different from the distance from New York City to the Indian Point nuclear plant in Buchanan, N.Y., which has become an issue since the Sept. 11 attacks. ''Of the technologies that exist today, you have to look at what can happen on the worst day,'' Mr. Lochbaum said. ''With wind power, you can go bankrupt. With a dam burst, lives can and have been lost, but it's fairly localized. The cost of cleaning up after Chernobyl, though, is greater than all of the benefits of the entire Soviet nuclear power industry combined, and it could have been worse.'' Correction: January 22, 2005, Saturday Because of an editing error, an article last Saturday about China's large-scale nuclear energy plans to satisfy its demand for electricity referred imprecisely to the importance of nuclear power in France, the only Western country committed to a large nuclear energy program. While nuclear plants provide a third of France's energy needs, as the article said, those plants provide about 80 percent of the country's electricity.",2005-01-15T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,world

That’s just what happened to Brian Moreno, a standout math student in El Campo, Tex., who planned to enroll at Texas A&M. Mr. Moreno pondered the unconventional advice and followed it, enrolling in nearby Bay City for a two-year degree as a nuclear power technician. For young people in the Gulf Coast towns surrounding Bay City, the nuclear industry is widely seen as the field of the future. Joe Yeamans II listened when a local businessman urged him to quit his job as an oil-rig security guard and go nuclear. Veronica Hutto worked for the local cable television company, where she helped place an advertisement about the community college program. She liked what she heard so much, she too signed up to train as a nuclear technician. In the Bay City area of South Texas — and in growing numbers of community colleges and universities — students are preparing for the jobs boom predicted for America’s nuclear power industry. The South Texas Project in Bay City operates two nuclear plants and plans to begin construction on two more in 2012, making it one of the hot spots in the nation’s nuclear revival. For the young workers, the promise is a stable career with excellent pay. They start at more than $50,000 in an apprentice program, and skilled technicians and operators with years of experience can make $80,000 or more. Nuclear engineers with four-year degrees can earn six-figure salaries. But the appeal is broader, as well. “We tell these young people, and they understand, that they are becoming part of something important,” said Clarence Fenner, the work force development coordinator for the South Texas Project, a Bay City councilman and a former first sergeant in the Army. “This nuclear renaissance is important for our community, our state and our country. It’s not just a job.” The anticipated work bonanza in nuclear power is no sure thing. Licensing and financing hurdles loom. Yet now that nuclear power, so long anathema to environmentalists, is increasingly seen as clean energy, the road ahead seems more promising than it has in decades, though the pace of any progress is uncertain. The demand for a new generation of nuclear workers is driven by a combination of forces. The industry, to be sure, is set to expand. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is actively reviewing 17 applications from companies that want to build 26 reactors, and more are on the drawing boards. These would be the first new nuclear plants in the United States in decades and would require a fresh crop of workers with some computer-age skills, as plant operating controls move from the analog realm of levers and switches to the digital world of point-and-click computing and 3-D graphics. Yet the industry must also bring many thousands of new workers into the nation’s existing 104 nuclear plants. Work force programs stagnated for years, as did the industry. In the next five years, 38 percent of current nuclear utility employees will be eligible for retirement, or more than 21,000 skilled workers, according to Carol L. Berrigan, a senior staff member of the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry research and policy group. Recognizing the looming skills shortage, the nuclear institute has worked with utilities and colleges to set up 52 partnerships with community colleges across the country to train nuclear technicians. The program in Bay City, housed in a converted Kmart discount store, was among the first, opening in 2008. In universities, too, there is a renewed enthusiasm for nuclear technology. Many colleges had strong nuclear engineering programs through the 1970s that were later pared down to focus only on submarine propulsion or weapons research, or lapsed altogether. But since the late 1990s, undergraduate enrollments have increased fourfold, to nearly 2,000 in the 2006-7 academic year, according to the most recent survey by the Nuclear Energy Institute. That trend seems to be continuing. Virginia Tech, for example, is a large engineering school that has expanded its nuclear program in recent years. Lauren James, 21, decided to focus entirely on nuclear engineering in her senior year, taking five courses and building a tiny model reactor with other students. “It’s an exciting field, there’s a lot to learn and it’s really growing again,” said Ms. James, who has two job offers already. The enthusiasm for nuclear power means that the nation’s veteran fleet of 104 plants is not headed for retirement anytime soon, though a few face closure by state authorities. Most of them, originally licensed by federal regulators for 40 years, are expected to go through the process of getting their licenses renewed for an additional 20 years. That will require new rounds of investment to replace and upgrade steam generators, turbines, piping and other equipment. In that way, experts say, nuclear plants are similar to commercial airliners or B-52 bombers. The original designs and exteriors may be old, they explain, but the insides are regularly updated and refurbished. “These plants are worked on every day, and they evolve,” said Neil Wilmshurst, a nuclear expert at the Electric Power Research Institute. He points to the shift to digital instrumentation as one example. “We’re gradually seeing the adoption of digital controls in the existing plants, while the newer plants in the rest of the world and the new ones being considered in the United States are all digital,” he said. “They make the operation of the plant more intuitive and more informed.” In a new nuclear plant, tiers of job creation offer varied work over different spans of time. The full-time utility staff of technicians, operators and engineers ranges from 400 to 700 a plant, and their jobs can last a working life. At least that many jobs are created in the local communities surrounding the plant, like restaurants, dry cleaners and retail shops that serve plant employees. Building a nuclear plant is an immense project, carrying a price tag of about $5 billion, lasting four or five years with peak employment of more than 2,000. Utilities are investing in training programs both of necessity and self-interest. Florida Power and Light, like the Texas project, was one of the early companies to set up a community college partnership to educate nuclear technicians it then hires. “In this nuclear renaissance, there is going to be a competition nationwide for workers,” said James Auld, college coordinator for the utility’s nuclear division. “We need to shore up our pipeline of skilled people.” For the early entrants in the new nuclear work force, the self-interest is more immediate and personal. They talk of being able to pay bills, enjoy a few restaurant meals and realistically think about buying a home. They are talking about the rewards of good middle-class jobs, the kind that used to exist in large numbers in manufacturing in places like Detroit and Cleveland. And a nuclear power plant is a just a giant factory, producing energy. Esperanza Lapaix, 32, graduated last year from the nuclear program at Miami Dade College and is now an apprentice instrument and controls technician at Florida Power and Light’s Turkey Point nuclear plant, south of Miami. Before, Ms. Lapaix was a computer technician, working at the community college and elsewhere, earning half the salary she does now. In March, she and her husband, Renald, a mental health care worker, bought a house in Homestead, Fla., something she says she could not have afforded before. Thanks to becoming a nuclear power technician, Ms. Lapaix, whose family emigrated from Cuba when she was a small child, is the first member of her family to own a house and have “a reliable, great-paying job,” she said.",2010-04-22T07:15:23.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

Domestic oil production accounts for only 0.3 percent of the total crude oil supply. About 35 percent of Japan's electricity demand is met by nuclear power. Three reactors are under construction, and eight are in the planning stage. Since it does not produce carbon dioxide emissions, nuclear power also helps Japan meet its commitment to the Kyoto global-warming treaty.

That's good news. The $4 billion plant should never have been built, but Long Island would now be much better off using it than abandoning it. Nevertheless, however desirable that end, the commission's decision illustrates the irrationality of the means. The licensing process is a tangle that cries out for Congress to create a coherent policy on nuclear power. It's plain no one else can. Shoreham was a mistake. It cost far too much to provide power at economic rates. And the power it could generate won't be needed for years. But the investment has been sunk and the critical economic question is whether it would cost less to run Shoreham than to produce electricity elsewhere. The answer seems clear: The best estimates suggest that operating Shoreham would save billions in the next 20 or 30 years. Economics is not the only consideration. Critics contend that the plant is unacceptably dangerous because it would be impossible to evacuate the area in an accident. In fact, no one knows whether any evacuation plan for any nuclear plant is feasible. But evacuation would be more difficult at many nuclear plants already in operation elsewhere. Some of them, being of older design, are less safe than Shoreham. In any case, the potential danger to the public from plant accidents has probably been exaggerated. Research since the Three Mile Island accident strongly suggests that the risks to people more than a few miles from a plant site are very small because the most dangerous radiation created by an accident would not travel far. Rules imposed in the wake of Three Mile Island nonetheless remain in place. Embarrassed Federal regulators allow nuclear plants to produce commercial power only after they have approved a 10-mile evacuation plan. The Suffolk County government, opposed on principle to the operation of a nuclear plant in its territory, seized on that rule. It insisted that 10 miles was not enough, and county police would therefore not cooperate in implementing any evacuation plan. Governor Cuomo, currying favor with the anti-nuclear lobby, then said the state police couldn't be used either. That, he contended, would be unwarranted interference in local affairs. Without county or state police cooperation, it's hard to see how an evacuation could be conducted. And without an evacuation plan, Federal rules say even the safest nuclear plant must stay shut. That's how, in a form of political judo, local and state authorities have used Federal power to defeat Federal policy on nuclear safety. But political judo turns out to work both ways. By giving the Long Island Lighting Company permission to test Shoreham, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has used its authority over safety to change the economics of the plant. Testing Shoreham will irradiate the machinery, making it $150 million more expensive to scrap the plant. That not only raises the stakes but creates a reverse political pressure on the Governor and the county. No matter which side throws the other to the mat, the underlying contradiction remains. When Federal safety rules can be used to say yes and no at the same time, nuclear power regulation is clearly a mess. Only Congress can clean it up.",1985-02-15T07:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,editorial-desk-opinion

The Tennessee Valley Authority obtained permission Thursday from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to begin the chain reaction in the Unit 2 reactor at the plant in northern Alabama. The utility's engineers said a sustained fission reaction began about 12:25 A.M. inside the reactor. That step, called achieving criticality, put the plant on course toward generating its first electricity since safety concerns ended all operations in 1985. Ten years earlier, the plant was the site of one of the nation's worst nuclear plant accidents. No major problems were reported this morning, and the reactor is expected to begin generating power within about two weeks, the Federal utility announced. ""Under our current schedule, this unit will be a contributor to meeting new power needs in the Tennessee Valley,"" said Oliver Kingsley Jr., president of the T.V.A.'s Generating Group. A plant spokesman, Craig Beasley, said workers began removing the reactor's 185 control rods to allow the enriched uranium fuel to attain a sustained chain reaction. That, in turn, generates heat to produce steam that drives turbines and spins generators. The T.V.A. hopes to begin selling power generated by the Unit 2 reactor this summer. The restarting of the reactor was being watched closely by nuclear power foes and by the nuclear industry. The three-reactor plant has not generated power since March 1985, when the T.V.A. agreed to shut down Units 1 and 3 because of safety concerns. Unit 2 was already idle, having been taken down for routine refueling in the fall of 1984. T.V.A. is planning to restart Unit 3 by 1995. There is no timetable for work on Unit 1. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission fined the utility more than $1 million for safety violations that occurred at Browns Ferry from 1980 through 1986. Before the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979, the commission had described a 1975 fire at Browns Ferry as the nation's worst nuclear power accident. During the shutdown, T.V.A. instituted a new management structure at the northern Alabama plant. About 1,000 improvements have been made in the interim at a cost of $1.3 billion. When it was shut down in 1985, Browns Ferry had the nation's largest nuclear-generating capacity, totaling about 3,300 megawatts for the three reactors. It is now No. 2, behind Arizona's 3,810-megawatt Palo Verde plant.",1991-05-25T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

When the industry first said several years ago that it would resume building plants, deep skepticism greeted the claim. Not since 1973 had anybody in the United States ordered a nuclear plant that was actually built, and the obstacles to a new generation of plants seemed daunting. But now, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 21 companies say they will seek permission to build 34 power plants, from New York to Texas. Factories are springing up in Indiana and Louisiana to build reactor parts. Workers are clearing a site in Georgia to put in reactors. Starting in January, millions of electric customers in Florida will be billed several dollars a month to finance four new reactors. On Thursday, the French company Areva, the world’s largest builder of nuclear reactors, and Northrop Grumman announced an investment of more than $360 million at a shipyard in Newport News, Va., to build components for seven proposed American reactors, and more for export. The change of fortune has come so fast that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which had almost forgotten how to accept an application, has gone into a frenzy of hiring, bringing on hundreds of new engineers to handle the crush of applications. Many problems could derail the so-called nuclear revival, and virtually no one believes all 34 proposed plants will be built. It is still unclear how many billions they would cost, whether the expense can be financed in a troubled credit market, and how the cost might compare with other power sources. But experts who follow the industry expect that at least some of the 34 will be built. Given rising public concern about global warming and a recent history of reliable operation among nuclear plants, “the climate for introducing new plants is probably the best it’s been since the industry started canceling plants” 30 years ago, said Brian Balogh, a history professor at the University of Virginia. Unlike most types of power generation, nuclear plants do not emit the gases that cause global warming, once they are completed. In the United States, orders for new reactors essentially ended in October 1973. That was also the month that the Arab oil embargo began, inaugurating an era of economic problems that drove up construction costs and suppressed demand for power. In the end, more than 100 nuclear reactors, some in advanced stages of construction, were canceled, and tens of billions of dollars were squandered. On top of that, the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 and the Chernobyl explosion in 1986 made nuclear power a hard sell. And cheap turbines were developed to burn natural gas to generate electricity. By the 1990s, even some nuclear plants that had been running for a few years were deemed too costly and were closed. But nuclear power never went away. The United States has 104 commercial reactors in operation, and the industry has improved their reliability markedly, increasing their output. They generate almost 20 percent of the country’s electric power. As concerns over global warming and natural gas supplies have worsened, strong support has developed in Congress and some states for new reactors. The governor of Maryland recently cited a “moral imperative” to build plants to counter the threat of climate change. Support for new reactors has long been strong in some localities, particularly those that are candidates for billions of dollars in construction work. And investment dollars are starting to flow. “We have a long-term vision,” Anne Lauvergeon, chief executive of Areva, said in an interview here on Thursday, explaining her company’s decision to join forces with Northrop Grumman at Newport News. To help spur a revival, Congress provided $18.5 billion in loan guarantees in a 2005 energy law, plus operating subsidies similar to those available for solar and wind power, and insurance against regulatory delays. Little effective political opposition to new reactors has emerged so far. The environmental movement is spending its energy fighting new coal-burning power plants, with considerable effect. While few environmental advocates are enthusiastic about nuclear power, a handful acknowledge it could play a role in countering global warming. “There is no question that some of the passion of the antinuclear movement has drained away,” said Professor Balogh, who is the author of a 1990 book on opposition to nuclear power. Worried about its ability to build coal plants, but needing new power plants to meet rising electric demand, the utility industry is determined to move ahead on nuclear power. While most spending so far is on engineering work and environmental studies, physical work is in the early stages, as well. The Georgia Power Company wants new units adjacent to its two Vogtle reactors, finished in the 1980s, and workers there are tearing down old buildings left over from that construction to make space for new construction. At the Port of Lake Charles, La., the Shaw Group and Westinghouse Electric, owned by Toshiba, are building a factory bigger than 10 football fields that will make components for new reactors in the United States and around the world. BWX Technologies, a subsidiary of McDermott International, is setting up a plant in Mount Vernon, Ind., to resume manufacturing reactor vessels and other big components. Both companies expect work for years to come. The industry’s most intractable problem, what to do with spent nuclear fuel, has not been solved. The government was supposed to begin accepting spent fuel for burial in 1998 but now says it will be 2017 at the earliest, and it is not clear that the site under study, Yucca Mountain in Nevada, will win a license. But companies that want to build say the industry could make do for the next few decades with an above-ground “interim storage” site. That might mean centralized storage in a remote desert facility. Some skeptics argue that a technology that needs taxpayer help on a large scale should not be built. In fact, construction costs for power plants of all kinds have risen sharply in the last two years, creating special problems for nuclear power, which has more steel and concrete than other plants of equal output. By some estimates costs have more than doubled since 2000. The critics argue that the same money spent elsewhere — on wind power, or on retrofitting buildings — could create bigger cuts in carbon dioxide output. Joseph J. Romm, an official in the Energy Department during the Clinton administration, pointed to a recent estimate by Florida Power & Light that a new reactor could cost a steep $8,000 for each kilowatt of capacity — enough power to run a window air-conditioner. That is at least double what a coal-burning power plant would cost, and Mr. Romm said that it was only the preconstruction estimate of an industry famous for cost overruns. He said the plants would be hard to finance. “I just read that McDonald’s was having trouble getting money, and there’s not a lot of risk in building a new McDonald’s,” he said. “Obviously, the risks with a nuclear plant are enormous.” He predicted a return to the problem of the 1970s — high prices for electricity driving electric demand down so much that plants under construction were no longer needed. Some people say they believe more political opposition will emerge once some of the proposed plants move closer to construction. At the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group in Washington that frequently criticizes the nuclear industry, David A. Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer, said it was too soon to say that opposition was weaker now than during construction of the older plants, when grandmothers tried to block bulldozers. “We’ve got the grandmothers; we just don’t have the bulldozers,” he said. “There’s not the Kodak moment that a lot of these protests need.”",2008-10-24T02:50:01.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day

Consumers Power, the biggest utility in Michigan, had already announced that the Bechtel Power In a transaction that could pave the way for building new nuclear plants, the Consumers Power Company said yesterday that it had arranged to sell a major part of a 19-year-old reactor to the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, a reactor manufacturer. Consumers Power, the biggest utility in Michigan, had already announced that the Bechtel Power Corporation, which manages nuclear construction, would buy a share. If regulatory approvals are obtained, the Palisades plant, a 768-megawatt station in South Haven, Mich., would be 22 percent owned by Westinghouse and 33 percent owned by Bechtel, with the rest retained by a subsidiary of Consumers. The deal is not expected to close until next year, after the plant undergoes repairs that will begin in September and are expected to take six months. The Michigan Public Service Commission is fighting the plan because it would transfer to Federal jurisdiction the issue of how much electric customers would pay for the power produced by the reactor. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates wholesale power transactions, has historically been far more generous to utility companies than have state regulators. One short-term reason for the sale is that Palisades has a poor operating record. As of the end of January, the last date for which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has published statistics, the plant had produced less than 44 percent as much electricity as it would have by running at full power since it achieved commercial operation at the end of 1971. Nationwide, the average is about 65 percent. Whether Westinghouse and Bechtel earn profits would depend in part on the plant's future reliability. Richard J. Slember, vice president and general manager of Westinghouse's Energy Systems Business Unit, said in a telephone interview yesterday that if Palisades achieved a performance level equal to the United States average, ''We will make money, but it won't be anything to blow your socks off.'' He added, ''We have a high level of confidence that with the combined resources of Consumers, Westinghouse and Bechtel, we can achieve better performance.'' Westinghouse has already taken over maintenance of the steam turbines and electric generator on a contract basis, he said. Basing a nuclear plant owner's rate of return on performance is unusual, but several states have tried that step for utilities. 109 Other Reactors With a dearth of nuclear construction - all those reactors ordered after 1974 have been canceled - Westinghouse and Bechtel, among others, are turning more heavily to nuclear service work. Analysts say that if those companies demonstrate good results at Palisades, it would help them win service contracts at the 109 other commercial reactors in operation around the country. Moreover, say both Westinghouse and outside analysts, the deal - the first of its kind - could demonstrate a way for new reactors to be built. Nathan I. Partain, an analyst at Duff & Phelps who follows Consumers Power, said: ''Looking down the horizon, for the next nuclear plant, the architect/engineer and manufacturer are going to have to take some of the risk. Utilities took all the risks last time, and they got burned by cost overruns.'' Dr. Slember said that at least the first few of the next generation of nuclear plants were likely to be owned by non-utility companies as independent power producers. An Inexpensive Venture He also pointed out that since the last nuclear plant orders ended, the nature of the utility industry had changed, with more new generating stations independently owned. Several advocates of nuclear power have suggested that any new reactors ordered would be likely to be built and operated by nonutility companies. If Palisades is a practice run in that direction, it is an inexpensive venture; Westinghouse would pay $20 million for its share. The price is based on the construction cost of the plant, plus later capital investments, minus depreciation. Bechtel's share is $30 million. Mr. Partain said that the sale was unlikely to make a big difference in the cash position of Consumers Power, a subsidiary of the CMS Energy Corporation, because with sale of the asset it would be required to pay off some mortgage debt. Westinghouse had initially supplied the steam turbine and electric generator at Palisades, and Bechtel was the architect-engineer.",1990-07-20T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business

The impression left is that high construction cost is the prime reason for the present unpopularity of nuclear plants. You did not mention the equally high costs of decommissioning, which is mandatory after 30 years. I was struck by your omission of the threats to health and life that are inherent in nuclear power. The serious dangers of nuclear plants are very well established. Millions of people the world over, including many renowned scientists, are deeply and properly concerned about the hazards of exposure to radiation during both the operation and the dismantling of nuclear plants. If a meltdown occurs - an event engineers and physicists say will take place within the next 10 years - millions may be killed. The wastes from nuclear plants will remain actively dangerous for thousands of years. We have yet to find a long-term solution to the threats presented by these wastes. Until the dangers posed by nuclear power plants have been overcome, this source of energy should be rejected - no matter how cheaply such facilities can be built and operated.

At issue is the 10-year-old Donald C. Cook nuclear plant at Bridgman, Mich. A grand jury in Grand Rapids, Mich., charged the plant operator, the Indiana and Michigan Electric Company of Fort Wayne, Ind., and the utility's corporate parent, the American Electric Power Company of Columbus, Ohio, with eight fire safety violations, according to the Justice Department. The two companies were also charged with a separate count of making a false statement to the Government, the Justice Department officials said. The utility denied all charges. John Brennan, a spokesman for the American Electric Power Company, said: ''We are shocked and deeply disappointed with this and intend to fight it vigorously. We are very confident that a jury will find no intentional wrongdoing on our part.'' #2d Indictment of Atom Plant The only other nuclear utility brought under criminal indictment in 30 years of commercial nuclear power operation in this country was the General Public Utilities Corporation, operator of the Three Mile Island power plant in Pennsylvania, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said. Also indicted, the Justice Department officials said, was Jude G. Del Percio, 33 years old, who was a senior nuclear engineer in charge of safety at the Cook plant in 1981. Mr. Del Percio, now of Sayville, L.I., could not be reached by telephone tonight. In Congressional testimony last May, commission members included the Cook plant among the 17 worst commercial nuclear power reactors in the country. Sue Gagner, a commission spokesman, said that the Cook plant, which includes two separate generating units, was operating and ''is in compliance with N.R.C. requirements, including those for fire protection.'' The 26-page indictment charged that in 1981, when the nuclear commission tightened the fire protection regulations on nuclear reactors after the Three Mile Island Accident, Mr. Del Percio and unidentified officers of the two corporations filed a statement with the commission ''falsely claiming'' that the Cook plant was in compliance with the new rules and needed no modification.

More Americans today, 73 percent, say they would oppose construction of a nuclear power plant within five miles of where they live, according to the latest Gallup poll. A 1979 Gallup poll showed that 60 percent said they would oppose such a project. According to a CBS News poll taken after the Soviet disaster, 75 percent of those polled said they would not approve of plants in their own communities. The poll also found that 59 percent of Americans disapproved of building any more nuclear power plants and 34 percent approved. Just after the Three Mile Island accident, 41 percent disapproved of more plants and 46 percent approved. The Gallup poll also found that 66 percent of the public, up from 55 percent in 1980, favored a cutback in nuclear power operations until stricter safety regulations could be effected. In the first Gallup poll on the subject in 1976, before any major nuclear mishap occurred, 40 percent called for stricter safety regulations, 34 percent thought nuclear power plants were safe enough and 26 per cent were undecided. The recent Gallup findings were based on telephone interviews with 1,004 adults 18 years and older conducted around the country June 9-16. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points. The CBS poll found that 55 percent of Americans thought an accident similar to that at Chernobyl was likely here and 44 percent were concerned that fallout from the Russian accident would affect them.

The government of Lianyungang, a city in Jiangsu Province, tried to calm residents on Sunday, a day after thousands of people defied police warnings and gathered near the city center, chanting slogans, according to Chinese news reports and photographs of the protests shared online. They chanted “no nuclear fuel recycling project,” the state-run Global Times reported , citing footage from the scene. “It is unsafe to see another nuclear project coming and besieging us,” one resident told the paper. Residents used WeChat, a popular Chinese messaging service, to share video footage showing downtown Lianyungang at night crowded with hundreds of people, many of them middle-aged, walking down a broad street in waves and chanting loudly, “Oppose nuclear waste, defend our home.” The city government responded with the mix of reassurances and warnings that Chinese officials often use in the face of protests over pollution and environmental concerns. “Currently, the project is still at the stage of preliminary assessment and comparing potential sites, and nothing has been finally decided,” the city government said in a statement issued on Sunday. But officials did not rule out that the site chosen might be somewhere near Lianyungang, and they warned against any more protests. “The relevant departments will use the law to strike hard against a tiny number of lawbreakers who concoct and spread rumors and disturb the social order,” the city government said. On Monday, there were no signs of renewed demonstrations in the city. But the residents had made their point: Another possible building block of China’s nuclear power expansion had come under passionate public attack, defying the police warnings and government attempts to defuse alarm. The Chinese government has said that it will accelerate building nuclear power and processing plants to wean the economy more quickly off coal. In March, the national legislature endorsed a five-year plan that promises to push forward with more nuclear power plants and a reprocessing plant for used fuel from China’s growing number of reactors. Japan also has plans to open a reprocessing plant. But in Lianyungang and elsewhere, fears over the safety of nuclear power — magnified by the Fukushima calamity in Japan in 2011 — could frustrate those plans. Lianyungang is just 20 miles southwest of a coastal nuclear power plant at Tianwan, which has two units operating, two under construction and approval to build two more. But the idea that used nuclear fuel might be reprocessed in the area seemed to renew anxieties about radiation risks. A 2010 survey of 1,616 residents in the area already showed widespread apprehension about the Tianwan plant: 83.5 percent of respondents said they “worried about improper handling of nuclear waste.” Complaints over industrial pollution, waste incinerators, toxic soil and other environmental issues have become one of the biggest causes of mass protest in China. And nuclear facilities have also become a source of worry for many. In July 2013, officials in southern China shelved plans for a nuclear fuel fabrication plant after hundreds of nearby residents protested. Proposals for new nuclear power stations have also been met by online denunciations and petitions. The demonstrations in Lianyungang broke out on Saturday after rumors spread that the area had been chosen as the site for a nuclear fuel processing and recycling plant to be built by the China National Nuclear Corporation, in cooperation with a French company, Areva. The companies have said construction will start in 2020 and be finished by 2030. The companies have not reported settling on a site, nor have they revealed many other details about the proposed plant. But when China’s premier, Li Keqiang, visited France in June of last year, the companies agreed “to finalize the negotiations in the shortest possible time frame.” Last month, a unit of the China National Nuclear Corporation said on its website that managers had visited Lianyungang to “study the proposed site.” That news appeared to sow alarm among some residents, who, in addition to the street protests, have taken to social media and online forums to voice opposition to the idea. On Sina.com Weibo, a popular Chinese site that works like Twitter, messages have sprung up using a picture of a face in a heavy protective mask holding up a nuclear radiation sign with a red X across it. “The people of Lianyungang don’t want radiation,” the picture says. The China National Nuclear Corporation’s nuclear fuel reprocessing unit said on its website on Saturday that the proposed plant would help the country become a “nuclear strong power.” But it emphasized that a site had not been chosen. It said places in six provinces, including Jiangsu, were under consideration.",2016-08-08T14:46:58.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The nation's nuclear power plants are delivering record quantities of electricity and doing it more efficiently and safely than ever before, according to industry statistics. But the never-ending debate about nuclear power's future is once again heating up, this time fanned by fears that many nuclear plants could become financial albatrosses as deregulation gives business and residential consumers choices about where they buy power. The issue: How will investors, taxpayers and consumers share in paying for the $70 billion or so in debts piled up to build the plants and the billions more that will eventually be needed to retire them? While the issue is far from settled, the new economics of competition is already driving the most basic strategic decisions at many utilities, ranging from the giant Commonwealth Edison Company, which supplies 70 percent of this region's power from 12 nuclear plants, to the Long Island Lighting Company, which never sold a kilowatt of power from its Shoreham nuclear plant but is struggling with the $4.5 billion debt left over from that abandoned project. The high rates that Lilco charges to pay off that debt helped push it into a merger with the Brooklyn Union Gas Company. Most nuclear utilities want a transition to free markets that could take as long as a decade. In that time, they want to be allowed to recoup their investment in nuclear plants from rate payers, even from those who switch to lower-cost competitors. Those who leave would be dunned in the form of so-called exit fees or surcharges on their new bills. Some nuclear utilities say they could be bankrupted or, at the least, badly punished on Wall Street if the transition comes too quickly and shareholders are asked to pick up more of the tab, in the form of reduced profits and dividends. The pressures to close marginal plants years before their licenses expire are already intense, as demonstrated by the decision in November of Northeast Utilities in Hartford to shut its troubled Connecticut Yankee plant 14 years ahead of schedule. The fallout from early closings, nuclear supporters say, often includes layoffs, huge tax losses in some communities, more air pollution from increased reliance on fossil fuels and less overall capacity to meet energy demand. Consumer groups and some nonnuclear utilities pushing for a much quicker transition say that forcing consumers to continue paying for plants they are not using will give electricity users choices but no real savings. Taxpayers may well be nicked in the crossfire; utilities are pushing for tax breaks to give them more financial flexibility in cutting rates. With more than 100 nuclear plants from Maine to California generating nearly a quarter of the nation's electricity, every region has a stake in the outcome. Vermont got almost 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear plants in 1995, Connecticut just under 70 percent and New Jersey and South Carolina almost two-thirds. So far, legislatures and regulators seem disinclined to let electricity consumers off the hook for nuclear investments that look wastefully expensive in hindsight. A handful of states, including California and Pennsylvania, have already adopted a variety of rules that give utilities several years to recoup their investments from consumers. Typically, they have softened the sting with related measures that result in freezes or even reductions in overall rates. What happens in most of the nation, though, is a question this year in state legislatures and public utility commissions. Those decisions may in turn hinge on whether Congress and Federal agencies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission weigh in with rules of their own affecting how fast the $220 billion industry is opened to competition. The spotlight in the debate may soon shift here to northern Illinois, home of Commonwealth Edison, a subsidiary of the Unicom Corporation and the industry's largest and most experienced nuclear power generator. Com Ed charges customers up to 60 percent more than utilities in neighboring states, making it an obvious target for competitors. Com Ed's nuclear portfolio is efficient enough that the excess energy it produces on weekends is easily sold on the open market. But some of Com Ed's plants are among the worst performers in the industry, others face huge renovation expenses and rates must cover accumulated debts of more than $10 billion. Com Ed says it welcomes competition but deserves time and financial breaks from regulators to prepare for it. ''If we can't figure out a way to make nuclear power a competitive advantage, no one can,'' Thomas J. Maiman, Com Ed's senior vice president for nuclear operations, said. Com Ed, which has been a pivotal power in the state's politics for more than a century, has plenty of influence to make its case. ''There isn't a reservoir of good will, but everyone understands that putting them out of business won't do anyone any good,'' said Al Musur, energy manager at Illinois-based Abbott Laboratories, who warily backs a deregulation proposal by a coalition of users and utilities that includes Com Ed. ''I'm more afraid we are going to take the 800-pound gorilla and make it a 2,000-pound one.'' In the Com Ed-backed proposal, like many around the nation supported by high-cost utilities, the transition period to open competition stretches into the next century. Some of the arguments for moving cautiously are technical -- new billing systems need to be developed and tested, for example. Moreover, it is still unclear how parts of the system that will remain regulated, like long-distance transmission lines, will be managed. But the utilities also argue that customers should not be allowed to duck paying for the existing plants and other assets like huge transmission systems built to provide reliable power. In the traditional regulatory system. those investments were made only after regulators had agreed they were necessary to meet anticipated growth. The utilities were then guaranteed that users would shoulder all design and construction costs the regulators found to be ''prudent'' over the lifetime of the plant. Customers have been forced to pay for such investments even if it turned out that another type of power plant -- or purchases of power from other utilities -- could have met their needs much more cheaply. Here, as elsewhere, the debate about nuclear power is part of a larger battle over what are widely called ''stranded costs,'' which include a broad range of utility expenses that might make it hard for them to compete in a free market. Com Ed, for example, has programs to subsidize electricity for low-income customers that would be ''stranded'' costs in a competitive market unless regulators ordered all electricity consumers to pay for them. Another significant family of stranded costs, common in California and the Northeast, is known as ''purchase power'' agreements. These agreements force utilities like the Consolidated Edison Company of New York to buy energy from independent power generators, even if it is more expensive than power being sold by other utilities or power the utility can generate itself. Many such programs were created to support the development of solar energy and other ''alternative'' energy programs. Purchase power contracts are threatening to bankrupt the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, an upstate New York utility. Nationwide, utilities face somewhere between $45 billion and $400 billion in stranded costs as they try to gear up for competition, according to various studies. Investments in big power plants, mostly nuclear, account for 40 percent of the total, taxes and other regulated subsidy programs another 40 percent and uneconomic ''purchase power'' from independent producers about 20 percent, according to David K. Owens, senior vice president for finance, regulation and power supply policy at the Edison Electric Institute, the industry's Washington-based trade group. The controversial history of nuclear power, though, makes it the most visible stranded cost. A number of nuclear plants were built before costs soared, enabling those operated by better-managed utilities to provide some of the least expensive power around. But many of the nuclear plants that have come on line the last decade or so, even those that operate efficiently, are likely to become white elephants in the age of competition if investors in Com Ed's parent and other utilities have to pick up too much of the tab. More than profits for investors are at stake: the N.R.C. has already served notice that it wants to make sure that deregulated nuclear utilities are financially healthy enough to sustain spending on safety. And some environmental groups want to make sure that utilities in the Northeast are not given any incentive to close down nuclear plants and rely more on electricity bought from Midwest coal plants, which cause acid rain and other forms of pollution. Com Ed's proposed transition program includes a five-year freeze on rate increases that began in 1996, annual rate cuts of 1.5 percent starting in 2000 and a completely open market for residential users by 2005. By that time, Com Ed estimates, its rates will have been cut 35 percent, after adjusting for inflation. That will put huge pressure on the company to become more efficient to avoid an earnings collapse, Leo Mullin, Com Ed's vice chairman, said. ''It's coming at the same time we have to build up,'' added Samuel K. Skinner, the company's president and a former chief of staff under President George Bush, citing a number of big development projects. Shareholders will help bear the load under Com Ed's proposal for accelerated depreciation of the nuclear plants -- an accounting measure that will not affect cash flow but will reduce net profits. ''Our shareholders have already paid dearly,'' Mr. Skinner said, noting that the dividend had been slashed from $3 to $1.60 four years ago after repeated delays in getting regulatory approval to charge consumers for nuclear plants that began supplying power in 1987 and 1988. But they have not paid enough, according to critics like Howard A. Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law and Policy Center. The Chicago-based research and advocacy group has battled Com Ed over rate increases for years and expects to campaign to shift more of the transition burden to investors. According to Mr. Learner, ''The public and the political leaders of the state have to say, 'Get real,' to Com Ed to force a reasonable deal.''

But not necessarily because the industry seems ready to take off. Toshiba surprised many in the industry by agreeing to pay a lofty $5.4 billion for a collection of nuclear power manufacturing facilities, with Westinghouse's being the centerpiece, assembled by British Nuclear Fuels. That move has only added to the talk of a rebirth of nuclear construction, but analysts say that most of it is still just that -- talk. In the United States, Energy Secretary Samuel W. Bodman recently referred to more than a dozen new reactors on the drawing boards, but not one has yet been ordered, and industry analysts do not expect to see any orders until late 2007, at the earliest. ''I think we all were surprised by the price,'' said Michael G. Morris, the president and chief executive of American Electric Power, the largest power generator in the United States. Mr. Morris, whose company serves five million customers in 11 states, favors more nuclear power. China has announced its intention to quadruple its nuclear output in the next 20 years, but at the same time the country has also stated that it wants to develop its own reactor. Politicians in Italy, Britain and Poland have been examining the merits of new nuclear plants. But to date, the only nuclear plant being built in Europe is a Finnish reactor that was the focus of 12 years of debate before construction began last year. Much of the optimism on nuclear construction is based on the idea that two recent trends will continue: the cost of competing fuels will rise, as will government controls on carbon emissions. And it assumes that methods of lowering carbon emissions from other energy sources, like coal, will not become widespread. Nuclear power plants are more expensive to build than gas or coal plants, and take several years longer to construct. But once built, they generate energy steadily and cheaply, and emit negligible amounts of greenhouse gases. In European countries where rules about carbon emissions are already firmly established -- in contrast to the United States, where limits are more lenient -- some critics of nuclear power have started to question whether building new reactors is a cost-effective way to lower these emissions. More nuclear power generation ''doesn't make sense economically and environmentally,'' said Norman Baker, a specialist on environmental issues for the Liberal Democrat Party in Britain. Spending £1, or about $1.70, on improving energy efficiency yields seven times the reduction in carbon emissions as spending the same amount on new nuclear construction, he said. ''If you're interested in climate change, you should demand clean coal and renewable resources'' instead, Mr. Baker said. Energy markets have changed significantly across Europe since the 1970's, the last time a significant number of nuclear plants were built. Many European power companies have been privatized, and the energy market opened up to competition in many countries. Any new construction would need to be financed by a private company, which would have to guarantee its investors that the reactor would earn profits in the future. It is not a sure bet, energy analysts say. It is ''too early to speak about a nuclear renaissance,'' a recent report on Europe by the rating agency Standard & Poor's concluded. ''The market environment is now significantly riskier than it was when the original nuclear plants were built,'' said Peter Kernan, an analyst at S.& P. who was a co-author of the report. ''Operators would need to be convinced there is a sound and robust business case'' for building a plant before they start devoting capital to it, Mr. Kernan said. He said there was no evidence yet to suggest that. Mark Herlach, a lawyer at Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan who represented British Nuclear Fuels in the deal and who specializes in energy asset sales, defended the price of the transaction, saying it made sense because of the rising costs of other fuels and concerns over greenhouse gases. ''This is a different environment,'' he said. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission recently approved the design of a new Westinghouse model, the AP-1000, an ''advanced passive'' reactor that would have fewer moving parts in its safety systems. No one has bought it yet. ''What Toshiba has done by this acquisition is acquired a leading technology in the AP-1000, '' Mr. Herlach said. And China, the largest emerging market in the world, has expressed a preference for that type of reactor, called a pressurized water reactor. With the Westinghouse deal, Toshiba has acquired more than a new reactor design. The bundle of assets being sold to Toshiba is the distilled result of years of scrambling and reassembling the companies that built reactors in the 1970's and 80's and still service them. The core asset in the sale is the former nuclear division of Westinghouse Electric, which had already absorbed Combustion Engineering. So, with Westinghouse, Toshiba gains two of the four companies that built the existing complex of American reactors. A third company, the commercial nuclear division of Babcock & Wilcox, is now in the hands of Areva, a French-German consortium. The fourth company is General Electric, which is trying to sell a newly designed reactor. With the sale, Toshiba becomes the only vendor to sell updated versions of both types of reactors now in use. But in the short term, the least glamorous parts of Westinghouse's business may prove the most valuable for Toshiba: the company's extensive repair and maintenance services.",2006-03-03T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business

They stood to lose mango orchards, cashew trees and rice fields, as the government forcibly acquired 2,300 acres to build six nuclear reactors — the biggest nuclear power plant ever proposed anywhere. But now, as a nuclear disaster unfolds in distant Japan, the lonely group of farmers has seen support for their protest swell to include a growing number of Indian scientists, academics and former government officials. “We are getting ready for bigger protests,” Mr. Gawanker said. While the government vows to push ahead — citing India’s energy needs — Indian newspapers recently reported that the environment minister wrote Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to question the wisdom of large nuclear installations. And a group of 50 Indian scientists, academics and activists has called for a moratorium on new projects. “The Japanese nuclear crisis is a wake-up call for India,” they wrote in an open letter. Opponents note that the area was hit by 95 earthquakes from 1985 to 2005, although Indian officials counter that most were minor and that the plant’s location on a high cliff would offer protection against tsunamis. The heated debate shows how the politics of nuclear energy may be changing, not only in the United States and Europe but in developing countries whose economies desperately need cheap power to continue growing rapidly. For Indian officials intent on promoting nuclear energy, the partial meltdowns and radiation leaks at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in Japan could not have come at a worse time. Currently, India gets about 3 percent of its electricity from the 20 relatively small nuclear reactors in the country. But it is building five new reactors and has proposed 39 more, including the ones here in Madban, to help meet the voracious energy needs of India’s fast-growing economy. Only China, the other emerging-economy giant with a ravenous energy appetite, is planning a more rapid expansion of nuclear power. Beijing has indicated that it, too, plans to proceed cautiously with its nuclear rollout. By 2050, the Indian government says a quarter of the nation’s electricity should come from nuclear reactors. And the project here would be the biggest step yet toward that ambitious goal. The planned six reactors would produce a total of 9,900 megawatts of electricity — more than three times the power now used by India’s financial capital, Mumbai, about 260 miles up the coast. So far, workers on the site are simply digging trenches, as a dozen police officers provide round-the-clock watch. Protesters, including Mr. Gawankar, have been arrested at various times, and state police officials have banned gatherings of more than five people in the villages near the site. Prime Minister Singh has been so committed to atomic power that he staked his government’s survival in 2008 on a controversial civil nuclear deal with the United States. That agreement, completed last year, opened the door for India to buy nuclear technology and uranium fuel from Western nations that previously would not sell to it because of India’s refusal to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Most of India’s reactors have been indigenously developed, but it is now building two reactors with Russian help. The proposed nuclear plant in Madban will use a new generation of reactors from the French company Areva. Projects using technology from the United States, and from Japan, are also planned. 10 Photos View Slide Show › Government officials have said that India will conduct more safety reviews to make sure its existing reactors and new proposals are safe. But they reiterated their commitment to nuclear projects, including the one in Madban, which has been named the Jaitapur Nuclear Power Plant, after a nearby village. Many Indian scientists, though, remain distrustful of India’s nuclear establishment. And they criticize the decision to use Areva’s new reactors, saying they are unproved. Compared with the 40-year-old Fukushima Daiichi boiling water reactors, Areva’s are of a newer sort known as pressurized water reactors, which the company describes as a major advance. But Areva’s first commercial installations of the technology, in France and Finland, have been delayed by several years after the initial designs failed to meet safety criteria. The company is also building two of the new reactors in China. Adinarayan Gopalakrishnan, a former Indian nuclear safety official, is among critics who argue that India should not import the reactors, which are known by the initials EPR, because they do not have a proven track record. “In view of the vast nuclear devastation we are observing in Japan, I would strongly urge the government not to proceed with the Jaitapur project with purchase of EPRs from France or any other import of nuclear reactors,” said Mr. Gopalakrishnan. He once led India’s Atomic Energy Regulatory Board and has also criticized the structure and independence of his former agency. The regulatory board reports to the Atomic Energy Commission, which runs India’s nuclear energy program and has long championed atomic power as an alternative to fossil fuels. The chairman of the regulatory board, S. S. Bajaj, was previously a senior executive at the state-owned Nuclear Power Corporation of India, which operates most of the country’s reactors and will run the Jaitapur plant as well. In an interview at his office in Mumbai, Mr. Bajaj said that despite being attached to the Atomic Energy Commission, his agency was “functionally independent” of the country’s nuclear establishment and technically capable of reviewing the Areva reactors. But farmers and fishermen fear for their livelihoods. Farmers say that some customers in Western countries have already indicated that once the plant starts operating in 2018, the fear of radioactive contamination will keep them from buying the area’s acclaimed Alphonso mangoes. The fruit this season is fetching 900 rupees (or $20) for a dozen in Mumbai markets. Fishermen complain that even before the first reactors start operating, their ability to navigate the nearby waters will be restricted by security officials. And once the plant starts, locals say it will discharge millions of gallons of hot water into the sea. That, they say, will make the coast uninhabitable for mackerel and other fish, ruining an industry that provides jobs to more than 20,000 people and supplies seafood to Mumbai and Europe. They say that about 160 miles north of the Jaitapur plant site, fishing has been severely curtailed by hot water from a controversial gas-fired power plant, built by Enron before it went bankrupt. “Nobody will buy our fish when they know that this nuclear plant is nearby,” Atiq Hathwardkar, 22, said on his family’s fishing boat near the plant site. “They want to move the country forward,” he said of government officials, “but they don’t care what happens to the common man.” Many local residents, as a form of protest, have refused to accept payment for the land the government forcibly acquired for the plant. The government is offering 1.5 million rupees ($33,000) per hectare (about 2.5 acres). But only 153 of the more than 2,000 landowners have taken the money. Pramila Gawankar, the wife of the mango farmer leading the protests, said she had no use for the money the government was offering and was adamant that she would reclaim her orchards and fields. “It’s nice to look out on the fields,” she said. “We have the sea. We have fish. We want for nothing.”",2011-04-14T07:51:55.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-global-business

The Power Authority plants are the Indian Point 3 power station in Buchanan, 35 miles north of Manhattan on the east bank of the Hudson River, and the James A. FitzPatrick plant on Lake Ontario. The planned sale is the latest in a string of moves in the nuclear power industry that is leading a rising proportion of the country's 103 operating nuclear plants to be operated or owned by just a few companies. The shift has some environmental groups and New York legislators concerned that intensified cost cutting, as the industry consolidates, could lead to safety problems. Officials at the Power Authority and at Entergy said the plants' sale would help lower the cost of electricity and not increase risks. Entergy, a private company in New Orleans, is also in a tentative deal to lease and operate two other nuclear plants in New York, Nine Mile Point 1 and 2, and is seeking to buy other plants in the Northeast. The company has agreed to pay $638 million over seven years for the Power Authority's two plants, as well as another $168 million, also spread over seven years, for nuclear fuel stockpiles. Under the deal, the Power Authority, a quasi-independent agency, would pay for most of the costs of decommissioning the plants when Entergy officials felt they had reached the end of their useful, or profitable life, Power Authority officials said. A fund of $630 million has been set aside for closing the plants, which is projected to grow to $1.9 billion before the plants are shut down, said Jack Murphy, a spokesman for the authority. Any additional decommissioning costs would be the responsibility of the buyer, he said. Experts in nuclear safety had a mixed reaction to the announcement, which had been expected for several months. Environmental Advocates, a private lobbying group in Albany, released a statement criticizing Entergy for cutting corners in maintenance and inspection programs at its Southern plants, and incurring federal fines in several cases. But David Lochbaum, a nuclear safety engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group in Washington, said, ''I don't think the sale of the plant is a safety issue.'' Mr. Lochbaum said that the pressures to cut costs at power plants are rising regardless of ownership, and that Entergy had a good record of reliability and safety. ''The real issue is that these plants are going to have to produce electricity at economical rates or they won't survive,'' he said. In many cases, he added, that may not be possible, and the pressure to cut costs may result in safety problems. Richard L. Brodsky, the Westchester Democrat who chairs the State Assembly's Environmental Conservation Committee, said he planned to convene hearings to examine the proposed deal. The sale needs the approval of the Power Authority's trustees, who are appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki, as well as the approval of Entergy's board, the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other government agencies.",2000-02-15T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been pushing to restart some of Japan’s 50 commercial reactors, all but two of which remain idle amid public anxiety over nuclear safety in the wake of the 2011 disaster, when a powerful earthquake and tsunami ravaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The announcement of the new guidelines starts a process that could allow some of the country’s idled reactors to come back online early next year. The new guidelines were announced by the Nuclear Regulation Authority, which was set up last year to replace the previous regulator amid outrage over its lax approach to safety and close industry ties. In the future, nuclear plant operators must bolster their tsunami defenses and check for active earthquake faults under their plants. They must also set up emergency command centers and install filtered vents to help reduce the discharge of harmful radioactive substances from the reactors. These safety standards are legally binding, unlike previous guidelines, which were not backed up by law and were adopted by nuclear operators on a voluntary basis. They also address, for the first time, the possibility of severe accidents like the Fukushima disaster, which set off multiple fuel meltdowns and forced more than 100,000 people from their homes. The regulator faces considerable pressure to reopen idled plants, but the difficult cleanup at Fukushima continues to cast a shadow over Mr. Abe’s drive to revive Japan’s civilian nuclear program. On Wednesday, the plant’s operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, said it had detected high levels of radioactive strontium in groundwater at the site. Tokyo Electric said it had found strontium 90 at 30 times Japan’s safety limit in groundwater near its No. 2 reactor, one of three at the plant, which suffered meltdowns after its cooling systems were knocked out by the tsunami. The operator has been struggling to store growing amounts of contaminated waste water at the plant, but had denied that the site’s groundwater was highly toxic. The latest discovery, made during routine checks at the plant, has raised concerns that water is leaking — possibly into the ocean — from the plant’s reactor turbine buildings, whose basements are flooded with radioactive water. If ingested, strontium 90 can linger in bones, emitting radiation inside the body that can lead, in time, to cancer. The Nuclear Regulation Authority said it would start accepting applications on July 8 from power companies seeking to restart their reactors. Seven companies have said they will apply to restart a total of 13 reactors across Japan. “We have reached a milestone” in nuclear safety, Shinichi Tanaka, the authority’s chairman, said Wednesday. He said the new guidelines brought Japan in line with the highest global safety standards for nuclear energy. It will take “many months” for the authority to conduct the necessary checks and approve bringing the reactors back online, authority officials said. Local news reports said the approval process would take at least six months. Separately, the nuclear regulator has been conducting studies of earthquake fault formations under six nuclear power plants across Japan. Last month, it concluded that a reactor in Tsuruga, in western Japan, stands above an active fault , a finding that could lead to the first permanent shutdown of a reactor since the disaster. It remains unclear whether the new standards go far enough to quell lingering public fears over nuclear power. In a nationwide poll of 1,781 people conducted by the newspaper Asahi Shimbun (excluding parts of Fukushima Prefecture) on June 8 and 9, 58 percent of respondents said they opposed restarting the country’s reactors, while just 28 percent said they approved. The authority’s meeting on Wednesday, which was open to the public, was disrupted several times by shouts of “Listen to the public!” and “No reactor restarts!” from the audience. Nevertheless, Japan’s power industry, pronuclear businesses and Mr. Abe’s governing party have been pushing to allow more reactors to restart. Japan relied on nuclear energy for about a third of its electricity needs before the disaster, and nuclear proponents argue that the ensuing energy shortfall and surging fuel import costs are hurting the economy. The problems at the Fukushima plant stem from groundwater that is pouring into the plant’s damaged reactor buildings at a rate of almost 75 gallons a minute. That water becomes highly contaminated there, before being pumped out to store in tanks at the site. The latest discovery of strontium in the groundwater could signal that water is leaking from the tanks, or from the damaged reactor buildings themselves. Tokyo Electric said Wednesday that it would bolster nearby seawalls and take other measures to make sure contaminated groundwater did not reach the ocean. “With the Fukushima disaster still front and center in the public’s mind, it’s critical that the government moves cautiously in restarting its nuclear program,” said Kazuhiko Kudo, a professor in nuclear safety engineering at Kyushu University. “Otherwise, the public will remain highly skeptical of its approach to nuclear safety.” Bringing the reactors back online would complete a reversal in Japan’s energy policy, driven by Mr. Abe, a supporter of nuclear power who took office late last year. His predecessors had committed to phasing out Japan’s nuclear power program by 2040.",2013-06-19T13:34:02.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The International Atomic Energy Agency said Wednesday that there was no need for immediate alarm over the condition of the decommissioned plant, where workers have safeguarded nuclear waste since the Chernobyl disaster of 1986. But officials said the situation around the site remained a source of grave concern. Russian troops have occupied the facility since the early days of the invasion last month. The I.A.E.A., a United Nations agency, said the loss of power violated a “key safety pillar” but said it saw “no critical impact on safety” at this time because the amount of water in cooling ponds and around radioactive waste was sufficient to keep the nuclear material under control, even without continuous power to the plant. Part of the reason is that the used fuel assembliesare old and not as dangerous as they once were. The American Nuclear Society, a professional group, agreed. “The loss of power is a serious matter but it does not pose a threat to the public,” it said in a statement.",2022-03-10T00:35:27.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

That is how Angelina S. Howard, executive vice president of the Nuclear Energy Institute, described the frenetic schedule of interviews on the day President Bush unveiled his energy plan. The nuclear energy industry is back in the spotlight, cited in the report of the National Energy Policy Development Group headed by Vice President Dick Cheney as one of the cornerstones of a broad, national effort to produce more power. Suddenly, nuclear power plants have become respectable again, and Ms. Howard and her colleagues at the institute, the industry's lobbying and public relations arm, were in demand for television appearances from 7 in the morning until 7 in the evening on Thursday. The Bush plan contains much good news for the industry, which has not gotten much respect in recent years. The cartoon comedy ''The Simpsons,'' for example, tweaks the industry frequently, with its bumbling patriarch, Homer Simpson, working at a nuclear plant. Now the nuclear power industry is getting new consideration, as Mr. Bush calls for new plants and the resumption of reprocessing nuclear fuel. And the nuclear power industry got one clear concession in the plan: a break that would eliminate the double taxation of money put aside for decommissioning plants. Those taxes, experts said, have been a deterrent to buying and selling nuclear plants. Mr. Bush's plan to re-evaluate nuclear reprocessing, in which nuclear waste is converted into reusable fuel, is also expected to draw attention to the industry. Britain and France currently reprocess fuels, but it has not yet proven profitable, group officials said. Anti-proliferation organizations have long argued that reprocessing creates bomb-grade nuclear fuels that could be converted into weapons. In fact, Mr. Bush's report noted the problem and urged an examination of ''more proliferation-resistant'' fuels. While the accidents at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and Chernobyl in Ukraine damaged the reputation of the industry, Joe F. Colvin, the institute's president, said the Bush plan presented a chance to talk about more recent advances in nuclear power. ''What we have done in the past two decades in the nuclear energy industry has made tremendous progress in improving the safety and the reliability and reducing the cost of nuclear generation,'' Mr. Colvin said. ''And we have a tremendous story to tell. In fact, what we have the opportunity to say through this administration and their leadership is to have nuclear energy be looked at as part of the solution to our nation's energy needs.'' Ms. Howard said the time was right to engage the public in the energy process. Other countries, she said, including China, Japan and Korea, are looking to the United States to be a leader in the nuclear industry. ''I had a 64-year-old grandmother call me after I was on the radio this morning, and say this stuff is interesting,'' Ms. Howard said on Thursday. There are 103 commercial nuclear power plants in the United States. And the institute has nearly 300 member organizations in 15 countries. In addition, the group has assembled a task force on nuclear deployment, which has met four times to draw up a business plan for new reactors. The task force will meet again this summer. The industry plans to discuss its strategy for building new nuclear plants over the next 20 years at its annual meeting here next week. Representative Billy Tauzin, a Republican from Louisiana who is the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and Senators George V. Voinovich of Ohio and Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, both Republicans, are expected to speak at the meeting. Mr. Cheney has also been invited, but has not confirmed whether he will attend.",2001-05-20T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

They said equipment installed in the last few years had increased the reactor's capacity to 880 megawatts from its original design capacity of 825 megawatts. In March and through much of April the plant generated record amounts of electricity, most of it sold to utilities outside New England. The Monday explosion and fire that crippled the power plant came in the most troubled year of operation in the plant's 19-year history, the officials said. The accident did not release radiation or damage the nuclear portion of the plant, utility and government officials said. They added that the nuclear reactor was safely shut down today, its heat slowly diminishing through clouds of steam vented into the atmosphere. Weeks before the accident, an anti-nuclear group here warned that mechanical malfunctions and what it said was an operating philosophy stressing economic returns over safety were pointing to the potential for a major accident. 9 Shutdowns in 9 Months Among the factors cited by the group, the Maine Nuclear Referendum Committee, was a sudden turn last July in the plant's operating record. After enjoying years of relatively trouble-free operation, the Maine Yankee nuclear plant was shut nine times in nine months because of leaks in the reactor, problems with gauges and monitoring equipment and difficulty in controlling the turbine that generates electricity. The group also said Maine Yankee officials were planning to replace a deteriorating electrical generator in September, yet were running the reactor at peak power, generating electricity in near-record levels in April. ""I'm sorry it happened, but things were going on out there that we were worried about,"" said Robert Moldaver, the executive director of the Maine Nuclear Referendum Committee, which is based in Portland, 40 miles south of here. ""We get accused of making up wild scenarios, but the way I feel is we were lucky it wasn't worse."" Charles D. Frizzle, the president of the Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company, which operates the plant for 10 utilities that own it, criticized anti-nuclear groups for trying to make the accident a political statement against nuclear power. He sought to characterize the accident as something that could happen at any electrical power plant, and said that in the moments after the explosion the plant's monitoring system identified a malfunction and automatically shut down the nuclear reactor without incident. ""As you can see, there isn't a lot of external damage to the generator and the fire does not look like it was very hot,"" Mr. Frizzle said in a tour this morning. ""This accident had nothing to do with the nuclear operations at this plant and had nothing to do with nuclear power."" Mr. Frizzle said engineers had determined that the accident was probably caused by a short circuit in the transformer outside the plant. Fire Less Intense Than Thought The short circuit produced a huge electric current that struck with enormous force. The transformer appears to have sustained an immense internal explosion. Its supporting steel beams are bent, bolts sheared in two, and the sides of the 750,000 pound unit bowed outward. Monday night, thousands of gallons of mineral oil, used to cool the transformer, poured out of the ruptured transformer, and some of it seeped into the Back River 200 feet away. Workmen scraped seaweed off rocks this morning, finishing the cleanup today. Inside the plant on Monday, the bolt of electricity split pipes carrying hydrogen gas to the generator, igniting a fire that was controlled within minutes but allowed to burn for nearly four hours for safety reasons, Mr. Frizzle said. The plant's fire brigade shut off the source of the hydrogen, a common coolant for electrical generators, seconds after discovering it. The fire did not appear to be especially intense, as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission initially reported on Tuesday. Paint near the source of the fire was smeared with soot but had not bubbled as a result of intense heat. The condition of the generator, however, is not known, Mr. Frizzle said. Workmen have been unable to dismantle the machine to get a closer look. A team of specialists from the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, the manufacturers of the generator, are on the way here to assist Maine Yankee technicians, Mr. Frizzle said. The Maine Yankee Plant will be shut for at least a month to replace the transformer, Mr. Frizzle said. Three years ago, the same transformer malfunctioned and had to be rebuilt. In the worst case, the plant could be shut until December. Maine Yankee was planning to close the plant in September to replace the generator because it was not large enough. It takes two months to install a new generator, and the replacement may not be ready until September. Maine Yankee supplies about a quarter of the state's electricity, but because of ample power supplies from hydroelectric dams, a short shutdown would not affect households or businesses, said a spokesman for the Central Maine Power Company, the plant's principal owner. A long shutdown, however, would cause problems in the summer, when demand for electricity is much higher. If the shutdown drags on, Central Maine officials said, the company may need to buy power from other sources at a cost of $2 million to $5 million a month in the summer. The company did not estimate today how much extra a typical household might pay as a result. Thomas Coffin, a spokesman for the Maine Nuclear Referendum Committee, said the extra expense might have been avoided had the nuclear plant's operators paid attention to what he called ""unmistakable warning signs."" Leaks and Malfunctions In the past nine months, the plant was shut down to repair leaks in the reactor steam generator system, malfunctions in gauges and monitors, and a problem in controlling the steam turbine. The anti-nuclear group said another sign of potential trouble was the boosting of the reactor's generating capacity. They warned the company and the public last week that such power loads might be dangerous because the reactor, the electrical generator and other main components were nearly 20 years old and might not be able to withstand the stress. ""Their song is always 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' "" said Mr. Coffin. ""But what I say is the potential for a severe accident is always there in a nuclear plant. It didn't happen. I'm glad. What you can also say is it didn't happen this time."" Mr. Frizzle, an electrical engineer who helped to start the reactor in the early 1970's and became the plant's president in 1989, said today that pushing the plant to peak power had nothing to do with the accident. ""There is no relation at all in the events of the last several months that would lead one to have any concern for the safety of the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant,"" he said.",1991-05-02T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

The official in charge of regulating nuclear power in the Soviet Union, on a tour of two reactors here, said today that his country might turn to an American company for help in designing reactors. The official, Vadim M. Malyshev, the chairman of the State Committee for Supervision on Nuclear Power Safety, toured the Indian Point 3 nuclear plant here, escorted by representatives of the New York Power Authority, which owns the plant, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Mr. Malyshev asked several questions about training and supervising workers. Soviet officials have said inadequate training and supervision contributed to the accident at the Chernobyl reactor. The accident occurred three years ago when control room operators conducted an unauthorized experiment resulting in a runaway reaction that destroyed the plant and spewed radiation. ''We were very much impressed with how monitoring and control of personnel is done,'' Mr. Malyshev said at a news conference during the tour. Assessing Accident Risks He also showed particular interest in a computer-driven simulator of the reactor control room that is used to train control room operators and in computer-assisted assessments of accident risks. Mr. Malyshev and three other officials of the Soviet nuclear program, who arrived here on May 16, have also visited Bechtel Power Inc.'s plant in Gaithersburg, Md. Bechtel, a leading nuclear engineering concern, is supervising a major improvement project at the Indian Point 3 plant. Mr. Malyshev said through an interpreter that the Soviets were evaluating the process of plant design and the possibility of using foreign companies. At Bechtel's San Francisco headquarters, Frank M. Staszesky Jr., the manager of European operations, said his company is discussing with the Soviets how Bechtel might assist in designing a new generation of reactors. ''I don't see us playing a role in their construction program,'' Mr. Staszesky said in a telephone interview. ''But we have some management techniques we can help them with.'' Mr. Malyshev, who was accompanied by three other Soviet officials and a Soviet translator, was part of an exchange begun in August, when Lando W. Zech Jr., the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, visited several Soviet reactors, including Chernobyl. The Russians also visited Indian Point 1, a plant owned by the Consolidated Edison Company of New York that was retired more than a decade ago, to discuss techniques for removing defunct reactors. The exchanges are expected to broaden in the next few months, with lower-level officials participating in extended programs. Two Soviet inspectors and an interpreter are to spend about seven weeks at the Duke Power Company's twin Catawba reactors, in Clover, S.C., in July, and two inspectors from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, with a translator, will go to the Zaporozhye nuclear plant, southeast of Kiev, on the Dnieper River.",1989-05-23T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, whose efforts to approve easier emergency evacuation plans that would allow the start-up of nuclear power stations failed to save the Shoreham nuclear power plant on Long Island, had an emergency evacuation of its own yesterday. On a 90-degree day, the air-conditioning failed in the commission's new 18-story suburban office tower, One White Flint North, in Rockville, Md. The windows of the $47.5 million building are hermetically sealed and, when an air-conditioner circulating pump failed, the 1,400 employees were sent home. The evacuation forced the cancellation of an afternoon commission meeting at which staff technicians were to give details in public for the first time on a new ''master plan for severe reactor accidents.'' The briefing was rescheduled for today, assuming the pump is fixed. The air-conditioning failure - it would be called an ''event'' in nuclear reactor parlance - was far from the first glitch at the new high-rise. Since the first wave of commission employees began moving in in early March, they have not been able to drink the water because solder used in plumbing construction contaminated the system with high levels of lead. The building is on bottled water. The elevators also proved to be under the stubborn control of a curmudgeonly wilful computer.

It is also the site today of an extraordinary international project, the construction of a vast steel shield to cover the leaky concrete ‘‘sarcophagus’’ in which the highly radioactive remains of the reactor are to be entombed for at least 100 years. The construction of what is called the New Safe Confinement by an international team of engineers and workers is already almost a decade behind schedule, and current plans call for it to be completed by 2017. Given the decrepit state of the sarcophagus, it is a race against time. Add to that the uncertainty and near-bankruptcy of Ukraine, and Chernobyl continues to stand as a fearsome testament to the dangers of nuclear power — more powerful than Three Mile Island before it or Fukushima after it. Yet it is also noteworthy that these civilian nuclear disasters did not and have not overcome the allure of nuclear power as a source of clean and abundant energy. Only Germany succumbed to panic after the Fukushima disaster and began to phase out all nuclear power in favor of huge investments in renewable sources like wind and sun. One consequence has been at least a temporary increase in greenhouse emissions as Germany has been forced to fire up old coal- and gas-powered plants. The dangers of nuclear power are real, but the accidents that have occurred, even Chernobyl, do not compare to the damage to the earth being inflicted by the burning of fossil fuels — coal, gas and oil. The latest dire warning from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change should leave no doubt that reducing carbon emissions must be an urgent priority and that nuclear energy must be part of the mix. It leaves no doubt, either, that the world must do what it can to increase energy efficiency and harness sun, wind, ocean currents and other renewable sources to meet our ever-expanding needs for energy. But the time when these can replace all fossil and nuclear fuels is still far off, and in the meantime nuclear energy remains an important means of generating electricity without adding to the steadily increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. For much the same reason, the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, an independent group formerly known as the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, urged policy makers this week to pay attention to the withering away of America’s fleet of 100 nuclear reactors. In the past year and a half, four power companies have announced the early retirement of five nuclear reactors, which supplied 4.2 percent of America’s total nuclear generating capacity. Two are in California and one each in Florida, Wisconsin and Vermont. Another company is considering closing as many as three financially struggling reactors in Illinois. The reasons for the shutdowns vary. In some cases, competition from cheap natural gas and from nearby wind farms has forced reactors to operate at a loss. In other cases, a marginal plant’s economic viability has been jeopardized by the cost of replacing steam generators to extend the life of a plant or by the cost of upgrading safety systems to meet new requirements imposed after the disaster in Fukushima. Whatever the reasons, these sobering trends, if left unattended, will make it harder for the United States to meet its goal of reducing carbon emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. The center notes that since 1990 nuclear power has consistently supplied about one-fifth of the nation’s electricity and more than 60 percent of all zero-carbon electricity. The watchword here and in the world at large should be prudence. Prudence in the design, maintenance and operation of all nuclear facilities. Prudence also in the sense that policy makers not be spooked into shutting down a vital source of clean energy in a warming world. The great shield over Chernobyl should also entomb unfounded fears of using nuclear power in the future.",2014-05-02T05:16:17.000+02:00,NYTIMES,editorial-opinion
f55ae97f-fa92-5afd-a864-844a000c8a8e,https://www.tipsproject.eu/tips/,China Investigates Top Nuclear Official,"BEIJING  The top official of China’s civilian and military nuclear power programs is being investigated for “grave violations of discipline,” a phrase often used in corruption inquiries, the Chinese Communist Party’s disciplinary committee has announced. The official, Kang Rixin, is the general manager and Communist Party secretary of China National Nuclear Corporation, a vast holding company that is spearheading plans to increase the nation’s capacity to generate nuclear power at least sixfold in the next decade. Mr. Kang, 56, also is a member of the Communist Party Central Committee, the party’s senior ruling body, and sits on the same party disciplinary committee that is investigating him. The announcement, issued late Wednesday, gave no indication of the accusations against Mr. Kang. The Beijing-based business journal Caijing and China Business News Daily quoted unidentified sources as saying the inquiry centered on about $263 million in company funds that apparently were invested and lost in the stock market. The publications also stated that investigators were looking into suspected bidding irregularities in nuclear power plant contracts. The inquiry is the latest in a series of investigations, involving high-ranking Chinese officials, that some experts believe are supported by President Hu Jintao, who has often called for a nationwide crackdown on corruption. It was unclear whether Mr. Kang had been suspended from his corporate or party posts. A press official at the nuclear corporation hung up in the midst of a request to comment on the report. With more than 100 sub-units, 14 scientific institutes and 280,000 employees, China National Nuclear is among a select group of state-owned companies whose business is monitored at the highest levels of the national government. Its businesses cover everything from uranium mining to reactor design and construction to the building of nuclear weapons. The company has increasingly focused on nuclear power, and turned a profit of $701 million last year. China has 11 nuclear power plants, with another 24 on the drawing boards or under way, according to the World Nuclear Association, an industry group. Mr. Kang took over the reins at China Nuclear with a pledge to transform it from a stodgy state-owned enterprise to a modern profit-oriented company. The company’s Hong Kong subsidiary, CNNC international Limited, recently bought a Canadian uranium mining firm, Western Prospector Group Ltd. Mr. Kang was named one of China’s top business managers in 2007. Several members of China’s powerful elite have fallen to corruption charges in the past year, led by Xu Zongheng, the politically connected mayor of Shenzhen, who lost his job in mid-June. Last month saw the conviction of Chen Tonghai, the former chairman of the Chinese oil company Sinopec, on charges of taking some $29 million in bribes from 1999 to mid-2007.",2009-08-06T16:26:56.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world
41dfc3f2-9aaf-562a-9f8e-fb139408f7ee,https://www.tipsproject.eu/tips/,’70s Echo in New ‘No Nukes’ Campaign,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 22  In 1979, in the dark freeze of the cold war and six months after the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Middletown, Pa., they packed Madison Square Garden for a series of “No Nukes” concerts that seemed to echo a generation’s fear of atomic Armageddon. Now, the musicians, Bonnie Raitt, Graham Nash and Jackson Browne, aging, activist rock stars, have reunited to battle the nuclear power industry on Capitol Hill. They hope to revive the antinuclear movement to have a single sentence dropped from the energy bill moving through Congress that could give the industry $50 billion in loan guarantees for new plants. But much has changed in 28 years. The debate on nuclear power has evolved, with fears of global warming prompting some officials, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, to say expanding nuclear plants has to be considered. A bill intended to lower emissions of greenhouse gases, introduced last week by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, and Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, sets goals that would be virtually impossible to achieve without new nuclear plants. The musicians disputed in interviews the portrayal of nuclear power as “clean energy.” Although they oppose nuclear energy generally, they have focused on the loan guarantees. The critics say the market should render a verdict on atomic power, compared to wind, solar and other renewable sources. The House and the Senate have approved versions of the bill, which has to be reconciled before being sent to President Bush. “If it’s such a great business, why doesn’t business do it?” Mr. Nash asked. “Why do they have to make the public pay?” A spokesman for Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who inserted the provision on loan guarantees, said they would not cost taxpayers anything and would be available to all types of energy developers. not just nuclear. “There is no handout,” the spokesman, Matt Letourneau, said. J. Scott Peterson, a vice president of the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry group, said: “We have proven that we are safe.

On Thursday, Georgia Power asked state regulators to approve its proposal to complete the reactors at the Alvin W. Vogtle generating station near Augusta, home to two existing nuclear units built in the 1980s. The company, which has partnered with three other utilities on the project, said it expected the new reactors would cost roughly $19 billion and come online in 2021 and 2022. In July, South Carolina utilities abandoned efforts to build two similar reactors, advanced designs known as AP1000s, after delays and cost overruns associated with the project caused local utility bills to soar. That decision left Georgia as the American nuclear industry’s sole hope for an expansion in the near term. While China is building 20  nuclear reactors , including four AP1000s, the United States has largely abandoned the construction of costly new nuclear plants. Utilities have focused instead on building smaller, less financially risky plants fueled by natural gas, wind or solar power. Ernest J. Moniz, a secretary of energy under President Barack Obama, warned in July that the decline of the domestic nuclear industry could mean the loss of a valuable tool to tackle climate change, since nuclear plants do not generate carbon dioxide emissions. He also argued that ceding the global nuclear industry to China and Russia could weaken nonproliferation standards. “The U.S. position as a valued supplier is rapidly being eroded,” Mr. Moniz wrote. For now, Georgia’s utilities insist they can succeed where South Carolina failed. In March, Georgia Power took over control of the Vogtle expansion after Westinghouse, the lead contractor in both states, filed for bankruptcy amid endless construction woes . “Our experience provides every indication that we can do a better job than Westinghouse alone as we move forward to complete the project,” Paul Bowers, the chief executive of Georgia Power, said in a statement . “The two new units at Plant Vogtle will be in service for 60 to 80 years and will add another low-cost, carbon-free energy source to our already diverse fuel mix.” But it is not certain that the Georgia reactors, first proposed in 2006, will actually be finished. In its filing, Georgia Power said that completion of the project depended on Congress extending a  federal tax credit for new reactors . The company is also counting on $3.7 billion in payments from Toshiba, the parent company of Westinghouse, as part of the latter’s bankruptcy agreement. Georgia’s Public Service Commission will conduct a six-month review of the Vogtle expansion before making a final decision. In July, Stan Wise, the chairman of the commission, argued that Georgia may be better positioned to finish its reactors than South Carolina, in part because costs would be borne by a broader base of customers: 2.4 million for Georgia Power compared with 700,000 for South Carolina Electric & Gas. The Vogtle expansion is also backed by $8.3 billion in federal loan guarantees awarded by the Obama administration. Critics noted that the Vogtle project could still be plagued by cost overruns, which would be passed on to ratepayers. The AP1000 is a novel reactor design, reported to have more safety features than previous models, and engineers have so far struggled with the project. Construction began before Westinghouse had finalized its design, and several safety changes had to be made midway through the process that pushed costs far past the initial estimates of $14 billion. Utilities in other states have found the cost of large new reactors prohibitive. Last week, Duke Energy Florida announced it would spend $6 billion expanding solar power while abandoning plans for a nuclear plant in Levy County estimated to cost as much as $22 billion. Meanwhile, more than a dozen older nuclear plants around the United States are retiring early in the face of low natural gas prices, portending a grim future for the industry. Nuclear power still provides 20 percent of the United States’ electricity, the largest source of carbon-free power. But in a recent interview, Maria G. Korsnick, head of the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry group, said that share could fall below 10 percent by midcentury if retirements continue and few new units are built. “We are in dire circumstances right now,” Ms. Korsnick said. A revival of nuclear power would depend on several factors, Ms. Korsnick said, none of them assured. States would need to act to support their existing fleets of financially troubled reactors, as New York and Illinois have done . Georgia Power would need to finish its AP1000s, allowing the United States to export the technology to the rest of the world. Other companies would also have to develop smaller, more advanced reactors, meant to be easier to build than the hulking light-water reactors of old. In January, Oregon-based NuScale Power submitted the first application for a small modular reactor to federal regulators, but the technology remains unproven, and the company does not expect to build its first working reactor until the 2020s.",2017-08-31T22:18:13.000+02:00,NYTIMES,climate-climate

Says","The International Atomic Energy Agency said on Wednesday that there was no need for immediate alarm over a loss of power at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, but left clear that the situation around the site of the world’s largest nuclear power disaster was deteriorating. Losing electricity means the potential loss of the ability to keep the water that cools radioactive material circulating. The United Nations agency said on Twitter that the plant, which has been occupied by Russian troops since the early days of the invasion, had suffered a loss of power that violated a “key safety pillar” for the site of the 1986 leak. But the agency added that it saw “no critical impact on safety” at this time because the amount of water in cooling ponds and around radioactive waste was sufficient, even without continuous power to the plant. But there are clearly deep worries in the nuclear community about the long-term fate of the decommissioned facility, which is still staffed by several thousand workers who oversee the plant and its fuel and waste storage. The shelling last week of a different, operating nuclear power facility led to calls from President Biden to the embattled president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky.

The project for the state-controlled utility has long been contentious. Critics have slammed it as an expensive and risky route to securing emission-free electricity. But the project — at a cost of 18 billion pounds, or about $23.6 billion — could well be seen as a vote of confidence in Britain’s future, barely a month after the country voted to leave the European Union. It would provide a welcome contrast to poor economic news in the form of plunging consumer confidence, a weaker currency and fears of recession. The new British government of Prime Minister Theresa May said in a statement Thursday evening, however, that it would “consider carefully” the project and make a decision in early autumn, casting doubt on the power station’s prospects. The green light may nevertheless kindle hopes that the project, known as Hinkley Point C, and other large infrastructure plans on the drawing board, like a £53 billion high-speed rail line from London to major cities farther north, will help offset some of the negative effects of the “Brexit” decision . Added to that is the actual electricity it will generate — enough to power six million homes, or about 7 percent of Britain’s energy needs. That would help bolster the global nuclear industry, which has found little appetite for building new power stations in the West since the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. “It is encouraging that the investment isn’t being scrapped because of the result” of last month’s referendum, Paul Hollingsworth of Capital Economics, a London research firm, wrote in an email. The power station is to be built on a headland overlooking the Bristol Channel in southwest England and will include two enormous French-designed reactors. It will be constructed and operated by EDF Energy, which owns and operates most of Britain’s nuclear power stations, including a 50-year-old plant known as Hinkley Point B in the same area. The approval of Hinkley Point C provides a welcome tonic for the ailing nuclear power industry in France, Europe’s leader in the business. The industry’s reputation has been dented by long delays and huge cost overruns on stations of the same design under construction at Flamanville in France, as well as in Finland. And despite fears of cost overruns, the British government has argued that, whatever the cost, Hinkley Point C is needed to keep the lights on and to help replace the country’s aging power plants. Nuclear generation also helps meet its clean-energy goals. To help fund the project, EDF and the British government have brought in China General Nuclear Power Corporation, a state company, as a minority investor. The company’s role may eventually provide the Chinese nuclear industry, which is in the midst of a domestic building boom, an opportunity to build a plant of its own design in Britain. Critics, however, question whether giant nuclear plants are the right solution for clean power in the 21st century. Hinkley Point C “is said to be the beginning of a new civil nuclear phase in the U.K., but in fact it could be a major setback,” David Howell, an energy minister under former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, wrote in an email. And while nuclear plants may produce clean energy, disposing of nuclear waste and the prospects of catastrophic accidents or terrorist attacks, pose problems. “No one worries about terrorists crashing planes into wind farms,” said Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace U.K. The long-awaited decision continued to be controversial up to the board meeting as one member, Gérard Magnin, resigned on Thursday, apparently over concerns about moving ahead with the project.",2016-07-28T22:52:50.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

That country is not Japan. “Germany chose to get rid of nuclear power because of Fukushima, while the United States is still in favor, but what about Japan, where the accident took place?” said Jun Tateno, who has written several books on nuclear power. “We still have not had a proper public debate about the most fundamental question: Do we want nuclear power’s low-cost electricity for growth, or do we want a safer, nuclear-free society?” Many analysts had hoped that last Sunday’s vote to choose the next governor of Tokyo would provide just such a forum to that question, which lies at the heart of Japan’s struggle to find its economic footing after two decades of malaise. But the results of the contest — which included an impassioned though unsuccessful run by two antinuclear candidates, including a former prime minister — were unclear at best. The current prime minister, Shinzo Abe, appeared emboldened by the results, saying a day after the election that he would soon release a “realistic and balanced” energy strategy, which analysts took as meaning one that would call for restarting at least some idled nuclear plants. But some analysts warned that Mr. Abe could still face a public backlash if he is seen as rushing to return Japan to its pre-accident status quo, especially if he fails to convince enough voters that the plants can be made safe. “The no-nukes candidates lost, but that doesn’t mean there is suddenly a consensus in favor of nuclear power,” said Shiro Asano, a retired professor of politics at Keio University. The election, in fact, appears to encapsulate the indecisiveness that has kept Japan paralyzed for nearly three years, since the triple meltdowns. After decades of marching forward in the belief that the resource-poor country needed cheap nuclear power to compete economically, Japan is no longer able to muster a new national consensus on it. At root, analysts say, is the deeper angst of a nation still grappling with the question raised by the disaster: Are the majority of Japanese who appear afraid to turn the plants back on willing to enter an uncharted, nuclear-free future that might consign their country to decades of lower growth? That question has taken on new urgency as a rising China is challenging Japan’s influence in the region. Voters continue to send mixed signals, electing Mr. Abe, who has called the low-cost electricity from nuclear power a vital part of his popular Abenomics strategy to revive growth even as polls continue to show an ambivalence about atomic energy. Voters have chosen Mr. Abe’s pro-nuclear governing party in national elections, but then oppose an immediate restart of the plants in opinion polls. That fuzzy message has left this consensus-driven country without a way forward, even as its once vaunted trade surplus has turned to a deficit, with soaring bills for fossil fuels to make up for the lost nuclear power. For the moment, many Japanese have compensated for higher electricity costs by embracing conservation efforts. And as was true even in the depths of the economic downturn, life for many Japanese remains relatively comfortable. The subways run like clockwork, the country is safer than many in the world and the economy is still the world’s third largest. While there have been warnings of companies being driven overseas by high energy costs, so far the costs have at least partly been offset by an upturn in profits under Abenomics’s lower-yen, growth-promoting policies, economists say. “People cannot feel the economic damage now because of the overall lift from Abenomics,” said Koji Nomura, an economics professor at Keio University in Tokyo. “But this is a bill that will come due.” The prime minister and his allies in the business community have argued as much, saying that the idling of the nation’s 48 operable reactors since the accident three years ago threatens Abenomics by forcing Japan to import an extra $36 billion worth of natural gas and other fuel every year. But even Mr. Abe has been unwilling to force the point by turning the plants on, while a new regulatory agency has appeared reluctant to risk a public backlash by declaring reactors safe to operate. The watchdog was expected to make its first ruling last month on whether reactors meet new safety standards set in July, but a decision is now not expected until spring at the earliest. Popular fears of nuclear power have not been helped by the continuing problems that plague the cleanup at the Fukushima plant, and continued instances of the utility in charge hiding bad news, despite promises that it would change. “I don’t know which way to go,” confessed Hajime Morikawa, 35, a temporary office worker who had come out to hear one of the antinuclear advocates before the election. “I hope this becomes a step toward a nuclear-free future, but I don’t see how we can just turn the nuclear plants off.” That type of sentiment helps explain the mixed messages of last weekend’s election. While the candidate from the governing, pro-nuclear power party prevailed, analysts say he did so in part by distancing himself from its stance with vague expressions of support for a gradual phaseout of nuclear energy. The two candidates who called for immediately scrapping all atomic power plants also fared better than the results seemed to suggest, winning a combined 1.9 million votes, just 200,000 shy of the victor’s tally. And the only avowedly pro-nuclear candidate of any stature, a former general, placed a distant fourth. At the same time, analysts said, Tokyo’s voters proved unconvinced by the lofty vision articulated by the high-profile antinuclear candidate, former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and another retired prime minister, the popular Junichiro Koizumi, who campaigned at his side. In campaign speeches, the two men, both patrons of the nuclear industry turned apostates by the accident, spoke urgently of the need for Japan to discard nuclear power and become a pioneer in safer, renewable energies they say could drive an economic resurgence. But many analysts said the victory of the governing party candidate signaled that many voters found the appeals of Mr. Hosokawa and Mr. Koizumi unrealistic. As a sign of the depth of the internal conflict, fissures have begun to appear even in Japan’s once solidly pro-nuclear business world. While the powerful Keidanren lobbying group representing Japan’s business establishment still remains a vocal supporter of restarting nuclear plants, many younger companies have turned against it. Rifts have also appeared within Mr. Abe’s governing party, where a group of about 50 mostly younger lawmakers have staged a revolt against Mr. Abe’s unabashedly pro-nuclear stance. But the public has also appeared to lose interest in weekly antinuclear street protests in front of the prime minister’s residence in Tokyo, where the number of people has dropped to a few hundred from tens of thousands two years ago. Some analysts say that in the end, they expect Japan to reject both the desire to go back to the pre-accident embrace of nuclear power, and idealistic calls to take more of a chance with the future. Instead, they say, they expect Japan to go back to the compromise position of a previous government that Mr. Abe scrapped when he took power: allowing the restart of the newest plants in exchange for promises that Japan will eventually shed nuclear power as realistic alternatives are developed. “Neither Abe nor Hosokawa is at the center of public opinion,” said Takeo Kikkawa, an expert on the energy industry at Tokyo’s Hitotsubashi University. “A gradual phaseout remains the best answer for solving the nuclear problem while preserving growth.”",2014-02-12T03:30:09.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

They are both passionate cheerleaders for nuclear power. It's just that the United States wants to deny Iran the right to develop its own nuclear power capacity. In a speech on Monday at a two-day conference on ''nuclear energy for the 21st century,'' Constance Morella, the American ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, told an audience of government officials and nuclear experts from more than 70 countries that American support of nuclear energy ''has never been stronger.'' Nuclear energy is clean, reliable, necessary for the world to have a secure energy supply and ''a benefit to humankind,'' she said. Ms. Morella cited a study estimating that global energy demand was expected to rise by about 60 percent over the next 25 years. ''America hasn't ordered a nuclear power plant since the 1970's, and it's time to start building again,'' she quoted President Bush as saying recently. In a speech on Tuesday, Mohammad Saeidi, a vice president of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, delivered more or less the same message. Citing Iran's half-century history of developing nuclear energy, he called the generation of nuclear power ''the prime priority'' of Iran's nuclear program. Oil and natural gas ''are limited and belong to all subsequent generations, and unrestrained use of this source of energy is not prudent,'' he said. The only problem with the presentations was what the speakers left out. The United States wants nuclear energy plants for itself. But it believes Iran's uranium enrichment programs have nuclear bombs and not electricity as their goal. In a de facto reinterpretation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the Bush administration has taken the position that a country like Iran is too dangerous to be allowed the technology to produce nuclear material for electricity, even if the treaty itself does not explicitly ban it. On Wednesday, officials from France, Britain and Germany, which negotiated a temporary freeze on Iran's uranium enrichment activities last November, will meet in Paris with Iranian officials to review three months of negotiations toward a permanent settlement of Iran's nuclear plans. While the United States is convinced that Iran is hiding a secret weapons program, the three European countries are less categorical in their assessment. Still, the Europeans' suspicions are serious enough that they are negotiating to persuade Iran to give up its uranium enrichment program permanently in exchange for political and economic incentives. (Uranium enrichment is a process that can be used to make nuclear material for use in either electricity or bombs.) Iran, by contrast, has declared that it would never abandon its right to enrich uranium, and in his speech on Tuesday, Mr. Saeidi reaffirmed that Iran would pursue a full-scale nuclear program. ''The people and government of Iran are determined to open their way through the tortuous path of peaceful use of nuclear technology despite all imposed restrictions and difficulties,'' he said. He called research activities, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes an ''inalienable right'' of signers of the nonproliferation treaty -- ''without discrimination.'' Mr. Saeidi did not mention Iran's agreement with the Europeans or the continuing negotiations. In fact, he described some of Iran's nuclear facilities as if all were functioning normally, even though some are not operating because of the freeze. In her speech in Paris, made in the name of Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman, Ms. Morella never uttered the word ''Iran.'' However, she said the pursuit of civilian nuclear power must not be diverted to dangerous weapons programs, citing, among other things, the importance of universal adherence to the additional protocol of the nonproliferation treaty. The additional protocol is a supplement to the treaty that substantially expands the ability of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear monitoring agency, to check for clandestine nuclear facilities. Ms. Morella did not point out that the United States signed the protocol in 1998 but that Congress has never approved it, so the United States has yet to put it in place.",2005-03-23T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,world

Germany, Europe’s champion for renewable energy, seems to be having second thoughts about its ambitious push to ramp up its use of renewable fuels for power generation. Hoping to slow the burst of new renewable energy on its grid, the country eliminated an open-ended subsidy for solar and wind power and put a ceiling on additional renewable capacity. Germany may also drop a timetable to end coal-fired generation, which still accounts for over 40 percent of its electricity, according to a report leaked from the country’s environment ministry. Instead, the government will pay billions to keep coal generators in reserve , to provide emergency power at times when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine. Renewables have hit a snag beyond Germany, too. Renewable sources are producing temporary power gluts from Australia to California, driving out other energy sources that are still necessary to maintain a stable supply of power. In Southern Australia, where wind supplies more than a quarter of the region’s power, the spiking prices of electricity when the wind wasn’t blowing full-bore pushed the state government to ask the power company Engie to switch back on a gas-fired plant that had been shut down. But in what may be the most worrisome development in the combat against climate change, renewables are helping to push nuclear power, the main source of zero-carbon electricity in the United States, into bankruptcy . The United States, and indeed the world, would do well to reconsider the promise and the limitations of its infatuation with renewable energy. “The issue is, how do we decarbonize the electricity sector, while keeping the lights on, keeping costs low and avoiding unintended consequences that could make emissions increase?” said Jan Mazurek, who runs the clean power campaign at the environmental advocacy group ClimateWorks. Addressing those challenges will require a more subtle approach than just attaching more renewables to the grid. An analysis by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, narrowly distributed two weeks ago, estimated that nuclear reactors that produce 56 percent of the country’s nuclear power would be unprofitable over the next three years. If those were to go under and be replaced with gas-fired generators, an additional 200 million tons of carbon dioxide would be spewed into the atmosphere every year. The economics of nuclear energy are mostly to blame. It just cannot compete with cheap natural gas. Most reactors in the country are losing between $5 and $15 per megawatt-hour, according to the analysis. Nuclear energy’s fate is not being dictated solely by markets, though. Policy makers focused on pushing renewable sources of energy above all else — heavily subsidizing solar and wind projects, and setting legal targets for power generation from renewables — are contributing actively to shut the industry down. Facing intense popular aversion, nuclear energy is being left to wither. As Will Boisvert wrote in an analysis for Environmental Progress, an environmental organization that advocates nuclear energy, the industry’s woes “could be remedied by subsidies substantially smaller than those routinely given to renewables.” The federal production tax credit for wind farms, for instance, is worth $23 per megawatt-hour, which is more than the amount that nuclear generators would need to break even. Nuclear generators’ troubles highlight the unintended consequences of brute force policies to push more and more renewable energy onto the grid. These policies do more than endanger the nuclear industry. They could set back the entire effort against climate change. California, where generators are expected to get half of their electricity from renewables by 2030 , offers a pretty good illustration of the problem. It’s called the “ duck curve .” It shows what adding renewables to the electric grid does to the demand for other sources of power, and it does look like a duck. As more and more solar capacity is fed onto the grid, it will displace alternatives. An extra watt from the sun costs nothing. But the sun doesn’t shine equally at all times. Around noon, when it is blazing, there will be little need for energy from nuclear reactors, or even from gas or coal. At 7 p.m., when people get home from work and turn on their appliances, the sun will no longer be so hot. Ramping up alternative sources then will be indispensable. The problem is that nuclear reactors, and even gas- and coal-fired generators, can’t switch themselves on and off on a dime. So what happens is that around the middle of the day those generators have to pay the grid to take their power. Unsurprisingly, this erodes nukes’ profitability. It might even nudge them out of the system altogether. How does a renewables strategy play out in the future? Getting more power from renewables at 7 p.m. will mean building excess capacity at noon. Indeed, getting all power from renewables will require building capacity equal to several times the demand during the middle of the day and keeping it turned off much of the time. Daily fluctuations are not the end of it. Wind power and sunlight change with the seasons, too. What’s more, climate change will probably change their power and seasonality in unforeseen ways. Considering how expensive wind and sun farms can be, it might make sense to reconsider a strategy that dashes a zero-carbon energy source that could stay on all the time. A report published last month by the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers suggests there is space for more renewable energy on the grid. New technologies — to store power when the sun is hot or to share it across wider areas — might allow for a bigger renewable footprint. But there are limits. “There is a very real integration cost from renewables,” said Kenneth Gillingham, an economist at Yale who wrote the report. “So far that cost is small.” In Germany, where renewables have mostly replaced nuclear power, carbon emissions are rising , even as Germans pay the most expensive electricity rates in Europe. In South Australia, the all-wind strategy is taking its toll. And in California, the costs of renewables are also apparent . Nuclear energy’s fate is not quite sealed. In New York, fears that the impending shutdown of three upstate reactors would imperil climate change mitigation persuaded Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office to extend subsidies comparable to those given to renewables, to keep them afloat. Even in California, where nuclear energy has no friends, Diablo Canyon, the last remaining nuclear plant, is expected to stay open for almost another decade . Still, both New York and California expect to eventually phase out nuclear power entirely. An analysis by Bloomberg puts the cost of replacing Diablo Canyon’s zero-carbon power with solar energy at $15 billion. This sum might be better spent replacing coal. Displacing nuclear energy clearly makes the battle against climate change more difficult. But that is not what is most worrying. What if the world eventually discovers that renewables can’t do the job alone? “I worry about lock-in,” Ms. Mazurek said. “If it doesn’t work, the climate doesn’t have time for a do-over.”",2016-07-19T19:21:56.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

Tokyo Electric Power, which operates the nuclear plant near Kashiwazaki, a city in northwestern Japan, said it had found more than 50 problems at the plant caused by the earthquake on Monday. While most were minor, the largest included 100 drums of radioactive waste that had fallen, opening the lids on some, the company said. The earthquake also caused a small fire at the plant and caused 317 gallons of water containing trace levels of radioactive materials to leak into the Sea of Japan, the company said. On Tuesday, the company announced that it had detected tiny amounts of radioactive material in an air filter in one of the plant’s seven reactors. But it said it was unlikely that the material had entered the atmosphere. The company said that it was still examining how the tainted water got out, but that the levels of radioactivity were too low to endanger people or the environment. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe criticized Tokyo Electric for being “too slow” in reporting the problems to the government and the public. “Nuclear power can only operate with the people’s trust,” Mr. Abe told reporters on Tuesday. Power companies “must accurately and swiftly report what is happening.” Television videotape showed rescuers digging through buildings in Kashiwazaki that had been toppled by the earthquake, which the local police said had killed at least nine people and injured an additional 1,000. Japan’s meteorological agency said the quake measured 6.8 in magnitude, while the United States Geological Survey put the magnitude at 6.6. Japan’s military used warships and trucks to carry rice balls, bread and water to the remote region in Niigata Prefecture, about 160 miles northwest of Tokyo. But relief efforts were slowed by landslides and gapping cracks in the earth that severed rail lines and roads, local news media reported. About 13,000 residents fled their homes, Japanese news media reported. Television videotape showed many people sleeping on blankets and futons in school gymnasiums that were being used as shelters. In Tokyo, government ministers scrambled to reassure the public about the safety of Japan’s nuclear power plants, which have had a string of accidents, at least one of them deadly, and cover-ups of incidents in recent years. The economic ministry, which regulates the power industry, moved swiftly to reprimand Tokyo Electric for not reporting the leak to authorities until about six hours after discovering the problem. The ministry also ordered suspension of operations at the plant, the world’s largest by amount of electricity produced, until safety could be ensured, and dispatched a team of inspectors to survey the damage. The power company said a cause of the damage was that the force of the shaking from the earthquake had exceeded the design limits of the reactors, suggesting that the plant’s builders had underestimated the strength of possible earthquakes in the region. The chief government spokesman, Yasuhisa Shiozaki, said the designs of other nuclear plants may also have to be re-examined to make sure they are strong enough to resist all potential earthquakes. Nuclear safety can be a particularly delicate issue in Japan, the only nation to be attacked with atomic weapons, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Nuclear safety experts said authorities apparently feared the earthquake-related accidents could raise fresh public doubts about Japan’s 55 nuclear reactors, which the nation relies on for about a third of its electricity and to lessen energy dependence on the Middle East. “This will stir new debate about whether nuclear plants are safe enough,” said Haruki Madarame, a professor in nuclear safety engineering at the University of Tokyo. “Authorities will have to show the public that they are taking all reasonable steps to ensure safety.” Japan is one of the most earthquake-prone nations in the world, and has strict regulations meant to prevent earthquake damage to its nuclear plants. Those include building nuclear plants on solid bedrock to limit shaking from earthquakes, and erecting walls to protect against tsunamis at plants along the coast, like the Kashiwazaki plant. Tokyo Electric said the damage from the earthquake did not threaten the safety of the reactors at the Kashiwazaki plant. Four reactors were operating at the time, and all shut down safely, Tokyo Electric said. Nuclear safety experts said the earthquake struck as power companies were examining reactors to see if they met safety standards revised last September. They said the unexpected strength of the earthquake’s tremors may force authorities to set even tougher standards, and carry out fresh seismic studies to determine if they were underestimating the size of potential earthquakes. The Kashiwazaki plant was shut down as Tokyo faced its peak power use during the summer. In March, another nuclear plant operator, Hokuriku Electric Power Company, shut down a reactor after admitting it had covered up a 15-minute uncontrollable nuclear chain reaction in 1999. Three years ago, Japan’s deadliest nuclear accident killed four workers at a nuclear plant in Mihama when a steam pipe burst.",2007-07-18T06:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

The move adds financial challenges for Areva even as demand for nuclear power appears to be on the rise. In a statement, Siemens said that its “role as a minority shareholder considerably limits the entrepreneurial maneuverability” of the company and that it no longer made sense to continue working with Areva. By withdrawing, Siemens could force Areva to pay more than 2 billion euros under an arrangement that was negotiated early this decade. Siemens said that Areva had three years, until Jan. 30, 2012, to acquire the 34 percent stake in the joint venture that Siemens currently owns. The purchase price still needed to be agreed upon, Siemens said. In the past, Siemens had expressed interest in buying a stake in Areva to take more of a leading role in the business. But those overtures were unsuccessful. Such an alliance would have threatened the desire of some political and business leaders in France to create a national champion out of Areva through mergers with other French companies. Areva and Siemens have worked together in the joint venture, Areva NP, since 2001, and they are building a nuclear plant in Olkiluoto, Finland. Areva is building the reactor components while Siemens is producing the conventional power equipment to generate electricity. Siemens said it was aiming to remain in the nuclear power business because it produced virtually no greenhouse gases at a time when such energy was in demand. “For us, nuclear energy remains an essential part of a sustainable energy mix,” said Peter Loescher, the president and chief executive of Siemens. Siemens said it expected 400 nuclear power plants to be built by 2030. Industry watchers have speculated that Siemens would join forces with Atomenergoprom of Russia, but Siemens executives would not comment Monday on the reports. Atomenergoprom representatives could not be reached. A potential complication for Siemens is a clause in its contract with Areva that bars Siemens from working in the nuclear power field for eight years after the end of the joint venture. Anne Lauvergeon, the Areva chief executive, has long resisted pressure from the French government to enter into ventures with other companies that could hurt Areva’s focus on nuclear technology. Even so, Siemens’s exit could push Areva into such an arrangement. Among the most likely candidates are Alstom, a French engineering group that makes power systems and high-speed trains, and Total, the oil and gas company. Total already owns 1 percent of Areva. More than 90 percent of Areva is held by the French government, which also could inject more money into the company at a time when nuclear power could be on the verge of a renaissance. Areva is competing to become the designer of reactors for the next generation of nuclear plants in the United States and elsewhere. The first of these models  the so-called EPR  is under construction in Finland. But that project is already overdue and vastly over budget, even though it was intended to have a shorter construction period than previous models. It has been plagued by water-logged concrete, faulty welds and flawed pipes, delaying the reactor start date by at least three years and raising costs by roughly 50 percent. Nuclear advocates say that the problems at the Finnish site are to be expected whenever a new reactor design is built. They also say that the high price associated with building nuclear plants would seem less daunting once gas and coal plants have to pay for their carbon emissions, and as the high costs of building and maintaining renewable energy projects, like offshore wind farms, become apparent. Skeptics say the nuclear industry deliberately underestimates the real costs of new reactors like the one at Olkiluoto, because investors and governments otherwise would refuse to finance them.",2009-01-27T01:15:35.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-world-business

Low, rocky hills descend to an industrial waterfront of docks, cranes and railway tracks. Out on the bay, submarines have for decades stalked the azure waters, traveling between their port and the ocean depths. Here, Russia is conducting an experiment with nuclear power, one that backers say is a leading-edge feat of engineering but that critics call reckless. The country is unveiling a floating nuclear power plant. Tied to a wharf in the city of Murmansk, the Akademik Lomonosov rocks gently in the waves. The buoyant facility, made of two miniature reactors of a type used previously on submarines, is for now the only one of its kind. Moscow, while leading the trend, is far from alone in seeing potential in floating nuclear plants. Two state-backed companies in China are building such facilities, and American scientists have drawn up plans of their own. Proponents say they are cheaper, greener and, perhaps counterintuitively, safer. They envision a future when nuclear power stations bob off the coasts of major cities around the world. “They are light-years ahead of us,” Jacopo Buongiorno, a professor of nuclear engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said of the Russian floating power program. Rosatom, the Russian state nuclear company, has exported nuclear technology for years, selling plants in China, India and a host of developing nations. But smaller reactors effectively placed on floats can be assembled more quickly, be put in a wider range of locations and respond more nimbly to fluctuating supply on power grids that increasingly rely on wind and solar. The Russian design involves using submarine-style reactors loaded onto vessels, with a hatch near the bow to plug them into local electrical grids. The reactors will generate a combined 70 megawatts of electricity, or enough to power about 70,000 typical American homes. Rosatom plans to serially produce such floating nuclear plants, and is exploring various business plans, including retaining ownership of the reactors while selling the electricity they generate. The bulky, rectangular structure resembles a big-box store, only with a nuclear emblem of an atom emblazoned on its side. Inside, the floating reactor is a warren of tight corridors, steep staircases, pipes, wires and warning signs in Cyrillic letters. Officials plan to tow the vessel to coastal cities in need of power, either for short-term boosts or longer-term additions to electricity supply. It can carry sufficient enriched uranium to power the two reactors for 12 years, before having to be towed, with its spent fuel, back to Russia, where the radioactive waste will be processed. A rotating crew of about 300 Russians, including private security guards, will operate the plant. Rosatom is considering a work schedule where they will remain on board for four months at a time before taking a four-month break. The Akademik Lomonosov will start out serving Pevek, a remote port in Siberia about 500 miles from Alaska, next year. While on the vessel, the civilian crew will have access to a host of amenities, making the structure a sort of cross between the set for “The Hunt for Red October” and a cruise ship. Those aboard can swim in a pool decorated with pictures of a tropical beach, play squash or strangely, given the seeming importance of sobriety on such a vessel, have a drink at a bar. “Such a local source of electrical energy, which can easily be transported to difficult-to-access locations, is economically effective,” Vitaly A. Trutnev, the director of Rosatom’s floating reactor program, said in an interview in the captain’s cabin, a suite decorated with orange upholstered chairs and wood laminate tables. Using nuclear reactors for marine propulsion, or on floating power plants, is not new. The United States used a barge-based reactor to generate electricity for the Panama Canal Zone from 1968 until 1976, and Westinghouse, the American reactor builder, planned — but never built — two floating plants off the New Jersey coast at around that time. The idea of floating nuclear power won unexpected support after the 2011 Japanese tsunami. That disaster wrecked havoc on the Fukushima coastal power plant by flooding backup diesel generators intended to cool the plant in an emergency shutdown. A floating reactor, supporters say, would survive tsunami waves at sea. And if an emergency shutdown were needed, it would retain access to cooling, something that is easier to do if it is already in the water, rather than relying on pumps. Rosatom, in a statement, insisted its plant was “invulnerable to tsunamis.” Professor Buongiorno of M.I.T. has himself proposed floating either small or full-scale nuclear plants on platforms similar to those used in the oil and gas industry. That, he said, would improve the project’s economics and safety as the nuclear industry seeks to compete with cheap electricity from wind, solar and natural gas. Placing nuclear reactors on vessels could also help reduce the costs of construction. Cost overruns, as well as political opposition, have all but halted nuclear plant construction in the United States. Assembly-line efficiencies at shipyards would help reduce costs. And then there is the potential climate change benefit. Nuclear power stations generate electricity free of planet-warming greenhouse gases and, unlike other clean sources of energy like wind turbines and solar farms, run around the clock. Rosatom has so far not disclosed the cost of building the barge, or which countries are interested in buying electricity. The company estimates each floating plant will take four years to build, compared with a decade or so for many nuclear plants. The Sudan Tribune has cited that country’s minister of water resources and electricity as saying the government in Khartoum has a deal to become the first foreign customer. A Sudanese government spokesman, Mujahid Mohammed Satti, declined to comment on the report. Others are also exploring the technology. China wants to build 20 floating nuclear plants , the first of which will start within two years. A French company has designed a reactor called Flexblue that would not float but rather be submerged on the ocean floor. But some environmental groups — even those open to a role for nuclear power as a substitute for traditional power plants — are skeptical. For one, they are not persuaded by Rosatom’s assurances of safety. Critics worry that during a tsunami, the 21,000-ton steel structure might not ride out the wave. In a worst-case scenario, they say, it would instead be torn from its moorings and sent barreling inland, plowing through buildings until it landed, steaming and dented and with two active reactors on board, well away from its source of coolant. In such a case, Rosatom says, a backup power source and coolant on board would prevent the reactors from melting down, at least for the first 24 hours. “During this time we would consider what to do,” said Dmitri Alekseyenko, the deputy director for Rosatom’s floating reactor program. Regulators in the United States, however, require on-land reactors to operate for 72 hours in an emergency shutdown without external water supplies. And the fact that the technology is well tested in Russian ships gives critics little solace, given a long history of spills and accidents involving nuclear-powered submarines and icebreakers operated by the Soviet and Russian navies. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Soviet Union dumped reactors in the Kara Sea , in the Arctic Ocean north of Kola Bay. Russian nuclear submarines sank in 1989 and 2000, while one Russian nuclear icebreaker caught fire in 2011 and the reactor on another leaked radiation that year, according to Bellona, a Norwegian environmental group. “The question is, would clients of Russia be comfortable with something like this being parked right at a pier in a major city?” Matthew McKinzie, director of the nuclear program at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington, said in a telephone interview. A Greenpeace sailboat tailed the Akademik Lomonosov on its maiden voyage from a shipyard in St. Petersburg to Murmansk, where it will be fueled, flying a banner in English saying: “Floating Nuclear Reactor? Srsly?” “Like all designs,” Mr. Buongiorno acknowledged, “nothing is perfect.”",2018-08-27T00:00:05.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

''No other country has undertaken this course in such an ambitious way,'' said Rezzo Schlauch, leader of the Green Party Parliamentary Committee. ''The shutdown of almost 20 plants in about 20 years amounts to a triumph for the Greens, and we believe other countries will follow our example.'' The agreement reached today between the ''Red-Green'' coalition of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, a Social Democrat, and the energy industry sets out a program for the fastest elimination of nuclear energy ever pursued by a major economic power. The plan would deprive Europe's largest economy of the current source of one-third of its power. In France, nuclear power accounts for more 70 percent of the energy needs, and in the United States, the figure is close to 20 percent. But in neither of those has concern over nuclear energy polarized society as in Germany. This is a country where environmental concerns are evident in everything from the stunning multiplicity of garbage cans provided for every form of recycling to the decision of many furniture stores to shun any object made from wood not obtained in ecologically sound ways. The precise pace of the closing was left flexible in an accord reached after what Volker Heck, a spokesman for the major RWE energy company, called ''a not very friendly discussion.'' He suggested that power utilities had accepted the accord because they were tired of the constant and costly harassment that has surrounded their nuclear operations and because the large surplus of electrical power in Germany will allow them at least five years to consider what new plants to build. A limit on the amount of electricity generated, equivalent to an average total working life of 32 years for each nuclear plant, was set. Because the last plant was built in 1989, that would suggest that the last plant would close in 2021. But as energy companies will be able to allot the permissible output as they choose among plants, some operations may continue beyond that date. In effect, the quick closing of inefficient plants will allow energy companies to use efficient ones longer. ''The figure of 32 years helps the Greens politically, but we were in fact left with some room to maneuver,'' Mr. Heck said. That flexibility was a condition of the companies in accepting an accord that provides for no financial compensation.",2000-06-16T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

Even though there is little talk about shifting away from the industry, comments this week by top French officials made it clear that there would be changes here that were likely to have an effect on the worldwide reckoning with nuclear power, given France’s long history with the industry. The head of France’s Nuclear Safety Authority , André-Claude Lacoste, made some of that process public on Wednesday when he told members of Parliament that the country would draw the necessary lessons from the Japanese experience and upgrade safety procedures. The most urgent task — and one that Mr. Lacoste acknowledged had been neglected — is a re-evaluation of the potential effects of natural disasters on nuclear safety. “Nobody can guarantee that there will never be a nuclear accident in France,” he warned. President Nicolas Sarkozy underscored the point on Thursday, when he traveled to Japan and called for new nuclear safety guidelines for all countries in the Group of 20, over which he currently presides. “Japan is not alone,” said Mr. Sarkozy, who was the first foreign leader to visit Japan since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami devastated the coast north of Tokyo and set off the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. He said global nuclear regulators, who are to gather under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency in June, should meet earlier, in May, to discuss the implications of the Japanese crisis. In Mr. Lacoste’s testimony, he said that the fact that more than one natural disaster could occur at the same time, as happened in Japan, “is a subject that until now we didn’t really take into account.” He promised to take a fresh look at the risk that tectonic activity could produce on French territory, particularly along the coast. Even though France’s nuclear reactors were built to withstand five times the impact of the worst earthquake ever registered here, severe flooding and bad weather in recent years have made clear that threats can come from multiple sources, and maybe amplify each other, Mr. Lacoste said. “ Climate change is changing the situation,” he said. “Extreme events that so far happened every thousand years along the coast now happen every hundred years.” Prime Minister François Fillon last month ordered a safety audit of the country’s 58 nuclear power plants. Nuclear experts are also to review a decision to keep a number of plants older than 30 years running and are cooperating with the Interior Ministry to update accident management and evacuation procedures, particularly in heavily populated areas around reactor clusters like those near Dunkerque, in northern France. Finally, Mr. Lacoste said, cooling mechanisms will be studied in more detail, not least because of their failure at Fukushima. France’s early caution in the Japanese crisis drew attention, particularly as it became the first country to advise its citizens to leave Tokyo and provided planes to repatriate those unable or unwilling to travel south, just days after the earthquake struck. Many countries eventually followed suit. The recommendation was the result of nuclear experts at the Japanese subsidiary of Areva, the state-controlled French nuclear company, warning the French ambassador about a potential risk of contamination in Tokyo if the wind turned and rain then deposited radioactivity from the damaged reactors in the capital. Whatever traces the current crisis might leave, France is unlikely to entirely turn its back on nuclear power, a legacy of Charles de Gaulle that has been broadly embraced by politicians across the political mainstream for decades. The nuclear industry in France is highly advanced and provides a major source of export revenue. Three partially state-owned French companies — Areva, GDF Suez and EDF — are among the most important players in the sector globally. EDF designs, maintains, operates and decommissions plants. In 2008, France produced 439 terawatt hours of nuclear power, representing 16 percent of global production.",2011-03-31T16:27:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-europe

The former leader, Lin Yi-hsiung, 72, began his protest on April 22, and it drew attention from Taiwan’s leaders and from protesters, who converged on central Taipei in recent days to say they were inspired by Mr. Lin’s sacrifice. In announcing the end of his fast on Wednesday, Mr. Lin thanked protesters for their recent campaign against nuclear power. “Over the past half month, the people of Taiwan’s outstanding display has been unprecedented, which leaves one feeling moved, full of admiration and deeply appreciative,” he wrote in a blog post. On Monday, the government announced that it was halting work on the Lungmen nuclear power plant in northeast Taiwan, about 20 miles outside Taipei, pending a referendum on its future. The project, known as No. 4, was started more than a decade ago and has cost more than $9 billion. The government has said the plant is important to Taiwan’s future electrical supply needs, and Prime Minister Jiang Yi- huah said suspending work on the project did not mean that it was giving up the possibility of restarting it at a later date. The 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan has raised concerns among many people in Taiwan about the safety of nuclear power, particularly with a plant that is near the ocean and the island’s largest urban area. After Sunday’s demonstration, which the police estimated drew 28,500 people and organizers say had as many as 50,000, a smaller number of protesters converged on a main street near Taipei’s main train station. They were forcibly removed by the police using water cannons. With the halt to construction on the plant and the end of Mr. Lin’s hunger strike, the momentum for antinuclear demonstrations has ebbed somewhat. But smaller protests have continued outside the legislature building this week, and Mr. Lin has called on his supporters to continue pushing for the shutdown of Taiwan’s three other nuclear power plants. “If work on No. 4 doesn’t resume, it’s no longer an issue,” he wrote. “Nuclear opponents should take a step forward to ensuring the No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 nuclear power plants are closed on schedule.”",2014-05-01T08:46:42.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The Georgia Power Company is being allowed to proceed with full-power operation of the Unit 1 reactor at the Vogtle Nuclear Power plant in east Georgia. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted 4 to 0 on Thursday to authorize a full-power license for the reactor after the commission staff recommended unanimously that the license be approved. Georgia Power, which has responsibility for construction and operation of the plant, owns 45.7 percent of the twin-reactor project, whose cost has risen to $8.87 billion from original estimates of $660 million. In January the utility received permission from the commission staff to load fuel in the reactor and begin a series of low-power tests. Staff members told the commission Thursday that no major problems had developed in those tests. George Bockhold Jr., general manager of Vogtle nuclear operations for Georgia Power, said the reactor would be ready to exceed 5 percent power on Monday and would complete its full-power testing program by mid-May. Commissioner James K. Asselstine raised the only questions about the license before the vote, asking both utility officials and the commission staff if the company could operate the Vogtle plant while working to improve operations at the Hatch plant, the company's other nuclear unit, near Baxley, Ga. Malcolm Ernst, a staff member from the commission's southeast region, said Georgia Power ''certainly has the management horsepower'' to handle both plants. He said operations at Hatch have been improving while the company's performance at Vogtle was ''certainly favorable compared to other plants at this stage of licensing.'' Lando W. Zech Jr., the commission chairman, commended Georgia Power for involving its senior managers in development and construction of the plant and for instituting a series of training programs for plant personnel. He said such programs, coupled with the utility's success in attracting college-educated operators, indicated that it understood the principle that ''people really are the primary contributor to a reliable, safe operation.'' The Vogtle plant has been under construction in Burke County, Ga., since 1978. The second reactor at the plant was scheduled for operation in September 1988, but the company earlier this week said the start now was not expected before June 1989.",1987-03-14T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

The main goal of the project is to insure that no bugs crop up that could lead to power blackouts on New Year's Day, said Bob Talbert, an American nuclear power expert who is working on the project. He said that he and other experts were already satisfied that the reactors' computers would not cause any safety problems and that the reactors would not automatically shut down at midnight on New Year's Eve. In United States Congressional hearings earlier this year, Central Intelligence Agency officials said that the Y2K problem might prompt sudden shutdowns of nuclear reactors throughout Ukraine and Russia. That could have particularly devastating consequences in Ukraine, where nuclear power accounts for almost half of all electricity. Although a nuclear accident was said to be unlikely, any mention of potential problems at Ukraine's nuclear reactors raises the specter of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in 1986. Earlier this month, a French diplomat told Agence France-Presse that his embassy was advising French citizens who ''do not absolutely need to be in Ukraine'' to take a vacation in France for the four weeks around New Year's Day. ''It's almost certain that there will be panic buying of food and fuel,'' the embassy's first secretary, Jean-Francois Devemy, was quoted as saying. The French Embassy quickly said that Mr. Devemy had been misinterpreted and had spoken partly ''in jest.'' The United States and British Embassies previously issued statements recommending that anyone planning to be in Ukraine around New Year's Day prepare for potential problems with distribution of power, water, fuel and food. Mr. Talbert, the nuclear expert, said that stocking up on water, food and gas would be a reasonable precaution, but that the worst he could imagine happening was localized blackouts of a few hours on New Year's Day. But another participant in the Y2K project, Valentin Ponomarenko, a private consultant, said he was concerned that Ukrainian officials do not fully appreciate the potential danger. He said he fears that power station managers would turn off faulty safety systems and keep electricity flowing rather than shut down reactors until the safety systems could be fixed. Mr. Talbert said that all 14 reactors' ''process computers,'' which are basically centralized record keepers, were known to be vulnerable. Although the failure of a process computer poses no immediate safety risk, he said, operators would be legally obliged to shut down a reactor within hours after the process computer stopped working. Ukraine has a record of ignoring its own nuclear safety regulations. During the harsh Ukrainian winter, the national power grid often operates on the brink of collapse, and nuclear power station operators come under heavy pressure to keep electricity flowing. Operators are tempted to take such risks because shutting down reactors would make the grid more unstable, potentially starting a domino effect that could shut down all reactors and create a countrywide power failure in the dead of winter.",1999-08-19T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,technology

The amendment to the energy bill would end the current system by which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission separately licenses construction and then operation of plants and replace it with a single review procedure. Backers of the measure said it could reduce regulatory delays by up to 10 years, although its prospects in the House remain highly uncertain. It was adopted by a unanimous voice vote, after the Senate rejected by a vote of 52 to 43 a weaker dereg ulatory amendment that would have granted citizens greater rights to go to court to stop the operation of a new nuclear plant after it was built. The energy bill in the House, which is still in committee, does not now have a similar provision. Part of Bush Strategy President Bush supports such regulatory change as part of his National Energy Strategy, which urges the development of more nuclear energy to satisfy utility needs by the year 2010. The Administration supports the energy bill, which grants permission for utilities to operate across state lines, and weakens regulations governing offshore oil drilling and construction of dams for the production of hydroelectric power. As the Senate waded this week through scores of amendments in this complex and often arcane legislation, it also approved a measure that will set efficiency standards for electric lights and motors to save $2 billion in yearly energy costs. And in an action that disheartened environmentalists, the Senate rejected an amendment that would have required refiners and petroleum importers to increase production of nontraditional fuels and non-petroleum additives to gasoline. Edward M. Davis, president of the American Nuclear Energy Council, praised the Senate action, saying it could ""provide the stability and predictability needed by the financial community and the utility industry to construct advanced, standardized nuclear energy plants and is a necessary step in re-establishing public confidence in nuclear energy."" The nuclear power amendment has become one of the most controversial measures among environmentalists since the proposal to begin oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was deleted from the legislation late last year. The nuclear power industry lobbied for the amendment, although much of the industry does not like the energy bill because of concerns that it favors competing energy industries, particularly electric utilities, even more. 'That's the American Way' Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana and chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, argued in favor of the amendment, saying it was necessary to permit nuclear energy to compete with other energy sources. ""We believe that through the competitive system you make the best decision on energy,"" he said. ""That's the American way."" Opponents of the measure said it would seriously reduce the ability of citizens and states to appeal to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that a plant is not safe once it is built. ""I think this is a step in the direction of more nuclear power, which means generating more nuclear waste,"" said Senator Paul D. Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota. But he added that the measure, even if it was endorsed by the House, would not guarantee the resuscitation of the industry. ""The problem is people are not going to want to have the plants where they live, and we also have to come up with a solution to nuclear waste disposal,"" he said in an interview. Sierra Club Disappointed Daniel Becker, a lawyer for the Sierra Club, expressed disappointment with the Senate vote, saying, ""We're deeply disappointed that the Senate voted to weaken protections in current law from nuclear peril."" More than 100 nuclear reactors have been canceled before operation in the last 20 years, including every plant ordered since the Three Mile Island accident in the late 1970's. A few senators argued that the country needed to develop nuclear power to reduce air pollution and compete with other economic powers. ""Twenty-six percent of Japan's electric power now comes from nuclear reactors and the Japanese plan to double their nuclear capacity over the next two decades, bringing 40 new nuclear plants on line,"" said Senator Alan Simpson, Republican of Wyoming. ""The Japanese trust a strategy where safety issues are resolved first. Why can't we?"" Some Provisions Added The deregulatory amendment gained the support of several senators after its sponsors added provisions that made Nuclear Regulatory Commission decisions to license plants subject to judicial review. Another provision that effectively watered down an original deregulatory proposal insists that the N.R.C. must assure that safety standards are met before a plant begins operations. The Senate rejected an alternative amendment that would have also streamlined regulations but would have required post-construction court hearings if clear safety issues arose after the construction of a plant was completed. Arguing in favor of the failed amendment, Senator Harry M. Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said, ""Health and safety should be our watchwords, not further streamlining and speed."" But Mr. Johnston characterized the provision for a post-construction hearing as a ""monster trial"" that ""would outlaw nuclear power as a potential source.""",1992-02-07T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business

The accident occurred on Saturday afternoon, when a pipe apparently broke in a 19-year-old nuclear power plant and touched off a series of events that ultimately forced the emergency flooding of the plant's reactor to cool its nuclear fuel. Government officials and the Kansai Electric Power Company, which owns the plant, said that no radiation escaped from the plant and no one was injured. But Japanese newspapers and outside experts said that the accident was the worst since Japan began operating nuclear power plants two decades ago. If an emergency cooling system had not worked properly, they said, the result could have been similar to the damage at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979. Accident May Help Opposition For the Japanese Government the biggest damage from the accident may be political. In recent months the Government has made a renewed effort to win support for the construction of many more plants, hoping that the war with Iraq would underscore the need to make the country less dependent on imported oil, but such efforts have largely failed. While the government has said that it wants nuclear power to account for 36 percent of Japan's electricity needs by 1995, up from 25.5 percent last year, growing opposition makes reaching that goal unlikely. ""This could be a major setback,"" an official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, who asked not to be named, said today. ""We don't know yet."" Already the anti-nuclear movement has delayed more than a dozen projects, including the opening of Japan's first installation to reprocess uranium. Reports about the scope and details of Saturday's accident are still sketchy, and Government officials say it may be a month or more before they fully understand what happened. The reactor itself, one of three in a small town called Mihama, 220 miles west of Tokyo and not far from Kyoto, will be inoperable for at least several months. Plants Concentrated in Region The reactor is part of the No. 2 power plant at Mihama, a pressurized water reactor built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Japan's largest builder of nuclear plants, based on a design from Westinghouse Corporation. About a third of Japan's nuclear power plants are in the region surrounding Mihama. In the plant, water surrounding the core is heated by the nuclear reaction and pumped into a second vessel. Heat from the thin tubes carrying the irradiated water turns water in the second vessel into steam, which in turn drives a turbine to generate electric power. According to reports in the Japanese press and accounts released by Kansai Electric, the trouble began with abnormal radioactivity readings in the secondary cooling system, which generates the steam to turn the turbines. At the time the 500,000-kilowatt reactor was operating at maximum capacity. Workers in the control room of the plant started to reduce the power output when they detected the readings. But 10 minutes later the reactor automatically stopped, after the water pressure in the core dropped precipitously. If the core is left exposed, the result can be a ""meltdown,"" an overheating of the fuel that can, if uncontrolled, lead to a large release of radioactivity. Meltdown Prevented In this case, there was apparently no imminent danger of a meltdown because an emergency cooling system was activated, flooding the reactor core. Japanese officials said, however, that this was the first time an emergency cooling system has functioned to halt any reactor. Company officials did not give a cause for the accident, saying an investigation was still under way. But local nuclear experts, quoted in the Japanese press, said that they were virtually certain that the cause was a broken pipe that allowed radioactive water to spill into the secondary cooling system. There have been reports in the past of three separate incidents in which small cracks developed in the plant's piping system, because of corrosion. The accident came less than a week after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party successfully beat back a challenge to the governor of Aomori prefecture, Masaya Kitamura, who has supported Japan's biggest nuclear project: a nuclear fuel recycling plant in the prefecture. The election was widely seen as a referendum on the building of the plant, Japan's first to reprocess nuclear waste, and Mr. Kitamura defeated two candidates who opposed the opening of the plant. Despite that victory, however, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry has made little progress in its efforts to counter growing opposition to more nuclear power plants. Japan already has 37 nuclear plants in operation, and another 16 are under construction. But oppostion in several regions of the country threatens the opening of those plants, and the latest accident, government officials say, will bolster that opposition.",1991-02-11T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,world

At least the first is true of the paladins of nuclear power. The Bourbons were said to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing. At least the first is true of the paladins of nuclear power. Even after Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, the sleepy managements of the nuclear reactors at Peach Bottom and Turkey Point cannot keep their employees from sleeping on duty. Critics have long accused the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of being in bed with the utilities, a complaint now echoed in Congress and investigated by the Justice Department. What is it about nuclear power that lulls those closest to it into torpor? Can so dangerous a game be worth the candle if its flame makes the players snooze? Both in the civilian nuclear industry and military nuclear production industry run by the Department of Energy, there are signs that the Chernobyl disaster of a year ago has not been fully taken to heart. Because Soviet reactors have a different and inherently less safe design, American nuclear managers have ignored a salient common danger: Ill-trained operators can cause disaster anywhere. At Philadelphia Electric's Peach Bottom plant, a dismal operating record has brought $435,000 in fines since 1983. During the night shift, operators regularly fell asleep in big, comfortable chairs. In a sharper effort to attract the management's attention, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission this month ordered the plant closed down. The need to spend $5 million a month on replacement power may prove an effective wake-up call. But throughout the years of the company's long sleep, an accident was waiting to happen. Although the N.R.C. kept imposing fines, for years it preferred to coddle than correct an evident problem. In trying to further both the nuclear industry and nuclear safety, the commission often serves neither. The commission seems to believe the industry is so fragile that strong safety measures would destroy it. But weak measures destroy public confidence and encourage industry to continue cutting corners. ''If they want to preserve nuclear power, the best thing they can do is to be tough policemen,'' says Robert Pollard of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Yet as shown in hearings held last week by Senator Glenn, neither external nor internal investigations at the N.R.C. are independent. The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation of Commissioner Thomas M. Roberts, from whose office a secret commission memo reached a utility under suspicion. No wonder Senator Glenn has concluded that the agency needs an independent inspector general. Tough, independent regulation is needed just as badly in the military nuclear materials industry operated by the Department of Energy. In the wake of the Chernobyl accident, the similar N-reactor at Hanford has been temporarily shut down and the capacity of the Savannah River plant reduced. Because of a long legacy of underinvestment, the whole production process is swamped with serious problems of human and environmental safety. Yet the Energy Department still refuses to acknowledge that it cannot be both operator and regulator. Nuclear reactor managers need independent overseers, lest their operators grow numb to danger and fall asleep at the switch.",1987-04-27T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,opinion

This is not the case. Wind and solar arrays cover vast amounts of territory, often destroying pristine wilderness areas that were home to many animal and plant species. The energy provided to the grid is weak and intermittent. Base-load energy — energy that can be supplied around the clock — is necessary to keep electricity continuously flowing in our homes and factories and hospitals. Today, that means burning coal and natural gas and running nuclear plants. Fossil fuels must be reduced and eventually abandoned for cleaner and safer power. The only course is to back up intermittent energy from renewables with clean nuclear power. Nuclear plants are capable of running for decades. Yes, repairs and replacements are required from time to time, as is the case with any energy provider. But Diablo Canyon and Indian Point can keep running far into the future. If you enjoy having the lights on so that the editorial board can go to work every day, you can thank Indian Point for providing a considerable amount of electricity to New York City and its government buildings and subway system. Imagine for a moment if you had to wait for a sunny or windy day to get New York running again. GWYNETH CRAVENS East Hampton, N.Y. The writer is the author of “Power to Save the World: The Truth About Nuclear Energy.” To the Editor: You got it right when you concluded that from a climate perspective, the smart strategy is to hold on to nuclear plants until their power can be replaced with carbon-free electricity. That’s why it’s worth paying attention to the recent landmark agreement between Pacific Gas and Electric, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. As far as I can tell, this is the first time that the announcement of a coming nuclear plant retirement will not be accompanied by the dismal reality that power-sector carbon emissions will dramatically increase, starting the day after the plant retires. I applaud the efforts of the diverse parties in Northern California, and hope that other regions of the country (like New York) figure out ways to align the needs of electricity customers for affordable, reliable and clean power with the need to assure that the power system lowers its carbon footprint over time. This will surely mean finding creative ways to align the financial interests of nuclear power plant owners with those of a low-carbon electric system. SUSAN F. TIERNEY Denver The writer, a consultant whose clients include Pacific Gas and Electric and Entergy, was an assistant secretary for policy at the Energy Department, 1993-95. To the Editor: Contrary to the implications of your editorial, California doesn’t have a plan to replace Diablo Canyon’s zero-carbon output. The renewables and efficiency called for in the proposed agreement amount to less than a quarter as much energy as Diablo Canyon produced last year. The rest? To be determined later, according to the agreement. The real replacement is likely to be natural gas, as it was for Vermont Yankee, Kewaunee and other prematurely closed reactors. Greenhouse gas emissions will increase, not decrease. Nearly all operating nuclear plants have secured 20-year license extensions, or are well on their way to doing so. These are 60- or 80-year assets, and will be more important as awareness of the climate change threat grows. These plants remain the dominant source of economical, clean electricity in the United States. REVIS W.

The goals are not incompatible, but the solution will require better management of demand, smarter use of coal as well as renewable energy sources, and increased use of nuclear power. As Congress considers an energy bill when it returns from recess, it will be under pressure to expand or limit the use of nuclear power. The issue, however, is not simple. More nuclear power will be necessary -- but more nuclear plants will be built only if more safeguards and incentives are put in place. The challenge is to make nuclear energy safer, cleaner and more economical. We built a model to compare the costs of producing electricity from new nuclear, coal and natural gas plants. The model focuses on economic cost, not regulated or subsidized cost. According to our study, the baseline cost of new nuclear power is 6.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, compared to 4.2 cents for coal and natural gas (when the price of gas is $4.50 per thousand cubic feet). Plausible, but unproved, technology could reduce nuclear costs to those of coal and gas. However, if a cost is assigned to carbon emissions -- either through a tax or some other way, as in a current Congressional proposal that would limit emissions but allow companies to buy and sell the right to discharge more pollutants -- nuclear power could become an attractive economic option. For example, a $50 per ton carbon value, about the cost of capturing and separating the carbon dioxide product of coal and natural gas combustion, raises the cost of coal to 5.4 cents and natural gas to 4.8 cents. Even under these favorable circumstances, the regulatory uncertainty threatening the large-scale investment needed for a nuclear plant will require some government assistance. A production tax credit, similar to that extended to wind power, is a good idea. It would give private investors an incentive to complete a plant. If no plant is built and operated, no public money is spent. If the first plants are indeed built and operated competitively, more will follow and the possibility of reducing greenhouse gases increases. Besides cost, there is the problem of nuclear waste. While it is technically possible to dispose of spent fuel safely, the issue is actually doing it. Successful operation of the planned Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada would be an important step. But the Department of Energy's nuclear waste research and development program should consider solutions beyond mined depositories like Yucca Mountain. For example, burying spent fuel several kilometers deep in a dry well, called a borehole, may offer significant cost and environmental benefits compared to mined repositories. This and other possibilities should be systematically explored. Finally, there is the challenge of nonproliferation, which is complex because of its international dimensions. There is no question that the current nonproliferation regime needs to be strengthened. Particular attention must be paid to enrichment technology and reprocessing. Enrichment, which converts natural uranium into reactor fuel, can produce uranium well beyond reactor grade, suitable for weapons. Reprocessing separates plutonium metal, which can be used directly in weapons, from reactor fuel. There is ample uranium available so that reprocessing can be avoided for at least the next 50 years. In the near term, the priority should be to require signatories to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, like Iran, to accept inspections of suspected but undeclared nuclear facilities. For the longer term, advanced nations that operate nuclear facilities should offer to provide fuel to reactors in less developed nations -- and to remove all spent fuel. Nuclear power can make an important contribution to meeting the world's growing electricity needs while helping to reduce carbon emissions. But this contribution will be realized only if the United States and other nations focus on making today's technology work and avoid expensive advanced technologies that involve reprocessing, which presents serious proliferation risks. It will be difficult, of course, to carry forward this nuclear agenda. Yet it will also be difficult to limit greenhouse gas emissions adequately while satisfying global energy needs for social and economic development. In both of these endeavors, American leadership is essential.

But neither that project nor the company's mouthful of a name has hurt its business prospects. A former branch of the Soviet atomic energy ministry, Atomstroyexport (pronounced atom-stroy-EXPORT) has been the Kremlin's main instrument to meet rising global demand for nuclear power, now mainly from developing countries. And Russia's state company may just be the right kind of provider, willing to deal with governments that other nuclear power companies shun. ''We're talking about a nuclear renaissance,'' Sergei I. Shmatko, the chief executive of Atomstroyexport, said in a recent interview in the company's headquarters in Moscow. ''We are certain we have a market.'' Atomstroyexport is building seven nuclear reactors -- in Iran, China, Bulgaria and India -- more reactors, it claims, than any competitor, particularly Westinghouse and General Electric of the United States, Siemens of Germany or Areva of France. Westinghouse, for example, has contracts for four new reactors in China, but has not begun work. It is a subcontractor or supplier at other sites, including six in South Korea, but is not the primary builder, a spokesman, Vaughn Gilbert, said in a telephone interview. Reactors designed by Westinghouse, however, remain the most prevalent in the world -- 45 percent of currently operating reactors. In raising capital and gearing up for new construction, the Russians are betting on an outlook that not everybody shares. Regardless of what choices are made in America, Japan and Europe, which remain wary of new nuclear power plants, the world is poised for another boom in construction, reminiscent of the 1960s and 1970s, as one nation after another seeks alternatives to the fossil fuels that are a culprit in global warming. Today, 26 power plants are under construction worldwide, in countries from Argentina to Romania, according to the International Energy Agency. Of these, only two are being built in developed economies -- one each in Finland and Japan. Still, some industry experts project that future demand will come from the developed economies, including the United States. Steven C. Kerekes, spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, representing owners and operators of nuclear plants in the United States, said he expected that utilities would build 30 reactors in the next 15 to 20 years. The United States now operates 104 nuclear reactors, more than any other country. The Russians, meanwhile, are in talks with Vietnam, Malaysia, Egypt, Namibia, Morocco, South Africa, Algeria, Brazil, Chile and Argentina, according to Mr. Shmatko. In a sign of the Russians' reach into markets others might avoid, last month the Russian company opened negotiations for a research reactor in Myanmar, formerly Burma, a country ruled by a junta. In Iran, critics say, the Russian company's work on the Bushehr plant gives the Iranian government a justification to enrich uranium, which the United States says could also be used to make bomb-grade fissile material. The Russians counter that the reactor itself is harmless if looked at separately from the effort to enrich uranium fuel. They say the site on the Persian Gulf complies with international treaties and does not contribute to nuclear proliferation. But Atomstroyexport seems eager to rebrand itself as a modern corporation with global reach and interests -- not merely as the supplier of nuclear expertise to Iran. Indeed, analysts of nuclear proliferation have not been easy on the company. Many say its narrow business interests have needlessly exposed the United States, Europe, Israel and possibly even Russia, too, to the risk that Iran may one day be able to build a nuclear bomb. Mr. Shmatko said in the interview in his office that the $1 billion project no longer even appeared profitable to the Russians and his company, because of rising prices for stainless steel and a shortage of skilled labor in the nuclear industry. He suggested that it was a drag rather than a benefit for Russia's nuclear business. Yet the Iran contract is only a small part of the company's global work and its expansive plans in the developing world. Atomstroyexport hopes to win $5 billion to $10 billion in new business in the coming two years, Mr. Shmatko said. In doing so, he said the company was shaking off Russia's dark legacy of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster by convincing foreign governments of engineering advances in Russian designs since then. Mr. Shmatko said his company's plant in Tianwan, China, is the first in the world to use a ''core catcher,'' a meltdown-control technology designed to trap the molten slug of uranium in a meltdown and prevent it from burrowing into the earth. The company, he said, is also introducing a new design for emerging markets. It has a line of minireactors more typical of the power plants for nuclear submarines or ice breakers. They are sized to fit the limited capacity of ramshackle electricity grids in developing countries, he said. Industrial reactors typically produce around 1,000 megawatts of electricity, enough to power a million American homes. Atomstroyexport says it will market reactors in the 300- to 600-megawatt range. Indeed, with the potential profits at stake, Western investors, including such heavyweights as Citigroup, are seeking ways to bet on the Russian nuclear power industry. Russia is pushing a business model that bundles nuclear fuel supplies with power plant construction contracts and that seeks to ensure that spent fuel -- a potential ingredient for dirty bombs or fission weapons -- is returned to Russia for storage. ''The world has no alternative but to develop nuclear energy,'' Mr. Shmatko, a former accountant, said. For now, investors can buy Atomstroyexport corporate bonds that were issued last month and attracted European and American investment houses. The Russian-registered subsidiary of JPMorgan, for example, bought into the $58 million offering, according to Atomstroyexport. A spokeswoman for JPMorgan said it had held only a ''very short-term trading position'' in the bond and no longer owned any Atomstroyexport bonds. Subsidiaries of a related company, Tvel, which makes fuel rods, trade on Russian exchanges. Citigroup owns about 5 percent of the Priargunsk uranium mine that is part of the Tvel group, according to the mine's Web site. On May 31, Sergei V. Kiriyenko, a former prime minister and head of the Russian atomic energy agency, said the government planned to consolidate nuclear assets into a state-controlled holding -- a sort of Gazprom of nuclear power -- to be called Atomenergoprom. That company would incorporate not only Atomstroyexport and Tvel but also uranium mines and companies that make fuel rod assemblies and specialized equipment like gas centrifuges for enriching uranium. Subsidiaries will most likely be open to foreign investment, analysts say. For Russia, the business of building nuclear power plants complements its business in fossil fuels. In fact, Russia's business of maintaining Soviet-designed plants in Eastern Europe may get a boost as these countries worry about excess dependency on Russian natural gas from Gazprom and reconsider nuclear energy as an alternative. Atomstroyexport's exact ownership, meanwhile, is something of a mystery. Organized as a joint stock company, it is 50.2 percent owned, and clearly controlled, by the Russian government. The rest of the shares, the company's Web site says, are owned by ''Gazprombank group companies.'' Marina V. Alekseenkova, an industrial analyst with Renaissance Capital in Moscow and an authority on publicly traded companies in the Russian nuclear industry, said that the phrasing shed little light on the private shareholders in the company, believed to be industry and government insiders. And those already concerned about Russia's role in the spread of nuclear technology should consider this: the Russian Atomic Energy agency is looking into developing floating reactors built on pontoons. The Russians envision a product that could be towed into ports in the developing world and hooked to the local power grid, for a fee. ''We are, generally speaking, the absolute monopoly here,'' Russia's first deputy prime minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, said of the floating reactors. ''Nobody apart from us is able or knows how to build them.''",2007-06-12T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business

From one perspective, nuclear power has been remarkably safe. The 1986 Chernobyl accident will ultimately kill about 10,000 people, mostly from cancer. Coal plants are much deadlier: the fine-particulate air pollution they produce kills about 10,000 people each year in the United States alone. Of course, for most people this kind of accounting is beside the point. Their horror over even the possibility of a meltdown means that the nuclear-power industry needs constant and aggressive regulation for the public to allow it to stay in business. Yet despite the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has often been too timid in ensuring that America’s 104 commercial reactors are operated safely. Nuclear power is a textbook example of the problem of “regulatory capture” — in which an industry gains control of an agency meant to regulate it. Regulatory capture can be countered only by vigorous public scrutiny and Congressional oversight, but in the 32 years since Three Mile Island, interest in nuclear regulation has declined precipitously. In 2002, after the commission retreated from demanding an early inspection of a reactor, Davis-Besse in Ohio, that it suspected was operating in a dangerous condition, its own inspector general concluded that it “appears to have informally established an unreasonably high burden of requiring absolute proof of a safety problem, versus lack of a reasonable assurance of maintaining public health and safety.” Even before Three Mile Island, a group of nuclear engineers had proposed that filtered vents be attached to buildings around reactors, which are intended to contain the gases released from overheated fuel. If the pressure inside these containment buildings increased dangerously — as has happened repeatedly at Fukushima — the vents would release these gases after the filters greatly reduced their radioactivity. France and Germany installed such filters in their plants, but the Nuclear Regulatory Commission declined to require them. Given the influence of America’s example, had the commission demanded the addition of filtered vents, they would likely have been required worldwide, including in Japan. More recently, independent analysts have argued, based on risk analyses done for the commission, it is dangerous for the United States to pack five times more spent fuel into reactor cooling pools than they were designed to hold, and that 80 percent of that spent fuel is cool enough to be stored safely elsewhere. It would also be more expensive, however, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission followed the nuclear utilities’ lead and rejected the proposal.The commission has even fought relentlessly for decades against proposals — and more recently a Congressional requirement — to distribute potassium iodide pills beyond the 10-mile emergency zones around American reactors, arguing that the probability of a large release of radioactivity was too low to justify the expense. And yet the American Embassy in Tokyo is handing out potassium iodide pills to Americans 140 miles from the Fukushima plant. The commission’s defenders often argue that it must be cautious because increased costs from safety requirements could kill the nuclear power industry. But the cost of generating electricity from existing plants is actually low: the construction expenses have been paid off and running them is relatively cheap. Requiring the operators of plants to install new safety systems would not result in them being shut down. Therefore, perhaps the most important thing to do in light of the Fukushima disaster is to change the industry-regulator relationship. It has become customary for administrations not to nominate, and the Senate not to confirm, commissioners whom the industry regards as “anti-nuclear” — which includes anyone who has expressed any criticism whatsoever of industry practices. The commission has an excellent staff; what it needs is more aggressive political leadership. Fukushima also shows why we need to develop reactors that are more inherently safe. Almost all the world’s power reactors, including those at Fukushima, are descended from the much smaller reactors developed in the 1950s by the United States for submarines. As we saw in the Fukushima accident, they depend on pumps to keep them from catastrophic failure, a major weak point. New designs less dependent on pumps have been developed, but there has not yet been enough research to make certain that they would work effectively. One promising design is the high-temperature gas-cooled graphite reactor; its fuel is in the form of small particles surrounded by layers of material that could contain their radioactivity if a cooling system fails. The United States built two such prototypes in the 1960s, and Germany built one in the 1980s. With the virtual end of new reactor orders in the United States and Western Europe, as well as their small generating capacity compared to current water-cooled reactors, they were not pursued further. China, however, which accounted for over 60 percent of the world’s nuclear power plant construction during the past five years, is now planning two prototypes and, if these work, 36 more. Such a demonstration could help determine the commercial viability of gas-cooled graphite reactors worldwide, and the Department of Energy should offer the expertise of its national laboratories to help China make this effort a success. ANOTHER area that requires review is unrelated to the Fukushima accident, but would benefit from some of the attention generated by the crisis — namely, the need to strengthen the barriers to misuse of nuclear-energy technology to develop nuclear weapons. The unintended effect of much of governmental research and development has been to make nuclear proliferation easier. Most notably, over the past 50 years the developed world has spent some $100 billion in a failed effort to commercialize plutonium breeder reactors. Such reactors would use uranium more efficiently, but would also require the separation of plutonium, a key component in nuclear weapons. Even though plutonium breeder reactors have yet to make it past the research and development phase into commercial production, enough plutonium has been separated from spent power-reactor fuel to make tens of thousands of nuclear weapons, creating an enormous security risk. The technology’s spread raises the possibility that it could be diverted to military purposes. In fact, this has already happened: in 1974 India tested a nuclear weapon design using plutonium that had been separated out for its breeder reactor program. Meanwhile, General Electric has applied for a license to build a plant that would use lasers to enrich uranium for commercial use, which could provide yet another way to produce weapons-grade material. A coalition led by the American Physical Society, a professional organization of physicists, has petitioned the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to assess the risk that this technology poses to non-proliferation efforts before it issues a license. The commission, predictably, has been reluctant to do so. It is critical to find more effective ways to control such dangerous nuclear technologies. In 1946, the United States proposed that uranium enrichment and plutonium be put under international control, a proposal that failed because of the onset of the cold war. More recently Mohamed ElBaradei, the former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, made the more modest proposal to place such dangerous activities under merely multinational control, which would make it more difficult for any one country to divert the material to military ends. In fact, Urenco, the West’s most successful uranium enrichment enterprise, is already under the joint ownership of Germany, the Netherlands and Britain. The United States should help shape this industrial model into an international one, in which all enrichment plants are under multinational control. Doing so would make it more difficult for countries like Iran to justify building national enrichment plants that could be used to produce nuclear weapons materials. While new plants are unlikely to be built in the United States over the next 25 years, nuclear power provides 20 percent of our electrical power and is climate friendly. We therefore must make existing reactors safer, develop a new generation of safer designs and prevent nuclear power from facilitating nuclear proliferation. As tragic as the Fukushima disaster has been, it has provided a rare opportunity to advance those goals.",2011-03-24T03:24:50.000+01:00,NYTIMES,oped-opinion

An agreement may come as early as next week, said the person, who declined to be identified because the talks were not public. A takeover would end five months of discussions about the future of British Energy, of which the government owns 35.8 percent, and would leave the company, which supplies about 17 percent of Britain’s electricity, in foreign hands. The acquisition would put Électricité de France, the world’s biggest provider of nuclear power, closer to its goal of building 10 nuclear plants by 2020 at a time when the power source has become more attractive. British regulators in January approved plans to refresh the country’s nuclear reactors, a move that made the utilities a more attractive investment for foreign companies. “The deal would have a strong strategic rational,” said Matthias Heck, a utility analyst at Sal. Oppenheim in Frankfurt. “E.D.F. would get access to the nuclear sites of British Energy and the possibility to build new nuclear plants. E.D.F. has also the strongest nuclear expertise in Europe and thus could help optimize the nuclear fleet of British Energy.” British Energy said in a statement that its board was in “advanced discussions with one party” though it declined to give further information. There can be no certainty that the discussions will lead to an offer, it said. A spokeswoman for E.D.F. declined to comment. Électricité de France shares rose 6.4 percent, to 54.73 euros in Paris on Friday. Shares of British Energy fell £1, to £7.27 in London. British Energy had rejected previous offers as too low after shares of energy companies increased on rising demand. But a decline in oil prices this week lowered British Energy’s share price and may help ease the way for an agreement, some analysts said. The British Broadcasting Corporation reported Friday that Centrica, a British utility, might join Eléctricité de France in its bid for British Energy and help appease the government by keeping at least parts of the company in British hands. A spokesman for Centrica declined to comment. Britain’s energy minister, Malcolm Wicks, said previously that the government did not object to foreign ownership of the nuclear plants, most of which were built 40 years ago. Many of Britain’s utilities are already in foreign hands. Spain’s Iberdrola has acquired Scottish Power; Germany’s RWE owns National Power and E.On of Germany controls Powergen. British Energy was privatized in 1996 but a slump in energy prices and an array of operational problems forced it to seek government aid in 2002. The proceeds of the sale of British Energy’s government stake will probably go to the Nuclear Liabilities Fund, which helps to make the country’s nuclear power stations safer and pays for the decommissioning of existing plants. Électricité de France, which is based in Paris, operates 58 nuclear plants in France and has been looking to expand abroad, including in Britain, Spain and South Africa. The company failed to take control of a power company and a natural gas supplier in Belgium over the last two months. E.D.F. owns EDF Energy in Britain, which supplies about 6 percent of the country’s electricity.",2008-07-26T08:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-world-business

The statements on Monday and Tuesday were distributed in translation by the Soviet press agency Tass and carried by The Associated Press, and the statement yesterday was monitored by the BBC from the Moscow radio and carried by Reuters. Monday's Statement An accident has occurred at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant as one of the reactors was damaged. Measures are being taken to eliminate the consequences of the accident. Aid is being given to those affected. A Government commisison has been set up. Tuesday's Statement As had already been reported in the press, an accident has taken place at the Chernobyl nuclear power station 130 kilometers north of Kiev. A Government commission headed by Boris Shcherbina, a deputy chairman of the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers, is working in the locality. It includes the heads of ministries and departments and leading scientists and specialists. According to preliminary data, the accident took place in one of the areas of the fourth power-generating unit and resulted in the destruction of part of the structural elements of the building housing the reactor, its damage and a certain leak of radioactive substances. The three other power-generating units have been shut down; they are in order and the operational reserve. Two persons were killed during the accident. Priority measures have been taken to deal with the effects of the accident. The radiation situation at the electric power station and the adjacent territory has now been stabilized, and the necessary medical aid is being given to those affected. The inhabitants of the nuclear power station's settlement and three nearby populated localities have been evacuated. The state of the radiation situation at the Chernobyl nuclear power station and the adjacent territory is being monitored continuously. Yesterday's Statement Work to eliminate the consequences of the accident at Chernobyl atomic power station is continuing. As a result of measures taken, over the past 24 hours the emission of radioactive substances has gone down and radiation levels in the area of the atomic power station and the power station settlement have been reduced. Measurements being carried out by specialists using monitoring equipment show that no chain reaction fission of nuclear fuel is taking place. The reactor is in a smothered state. Work is under way to cleanse polluted areas of the adjoining locality. Specialized sub-units supplied with the necessary up-to-date equipment and effective facilities have been brought in to carry this work out. Some news agencies in the West are spreading rumors that thousands of people, allegedly, perished during the accident at the atomic power station. It has already been reported that in reality two persons died, that only 197 people were hospitalized. Forty-nine of them were discharged from the hospital after a medical examination. Enterprises, collective farms and state farms and institutions are functioning normally. The Council of Ministers of the Ukraine reported that, according to the govermental commission, the radiation situation at the Chernobyl atomic power station and in the adjoining locality is improving. The state of the air basin over the remaining territory of the Kiev region and the city of Kiev is causing no concern. The quality of the drinking water, as well as of the water in rivers and water reservoirs, is in line with standards. Constant observations are being carried out over the state of the environment.",1986-05-01T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world

That folly could threaten the nation's security, not just Long Island's, by further eroding public confidence in nuclear power. Its cost will become clear enough when brownouts or even rolling blackouts hit New York's politicians propose cutting a deal to scrap the completed, ready-to-run Shoreham nuclear power plant on Long Island. That folly could threaten the nation's security, not just Long Island's, by further eroding public confidence in nuclear power. Its cost will become clear enough when brownouts or even rolling blackouts hit Hempstead this summer, and when oil prices once again rise sharply. When the energy noose tightens, America will need a fuel-efficient automobile fleet, energy-efficient homes and appliances, a full strategic petroleum reserve and power plants - including nuclear reactors - that substitute for foreign oil. The Reagan Administration has opposed almost all such initiatives, preferring to entrust America's energy security to the mercy of world markets. New York's politicians have been no more farsighted. Confronted with the $5.3 billion nuclear power plant built by an unpopular utility, the Long Island Lighting Company, they have chosen the easy way out. Building Shoreham may have been a mistake; scrapping it now that it's completed and as safe as Federal regulators can make it would be a monumental error. Governor Cuomo could have led the way out of the impasse. He could have devised a plan to mitigate rate shocks, by funneling in some of New York's low-cost hydropower and seeing that Lilco's stockholders bore a large share of imprudent cost overruns. He could have demanded extra safety measures, then assured the public the plant could be operated. Instead, Mr. Cuomo has played wrecker. He has done everything to prevent Lilco from obtaining approval in Washington of its emergency evacuation plan, even though its only serious flaw is the state's own refusal to cooperate. He has helped weaken the company by opposing rate increases. He now proposes a preposterous deal: letting Lilco survive in return for abandoning Shoreham to the state, which would shut it down. Long Islanders would lose because the company would be guaranteed a 5 percent annual rate increase for a decade - about the same as it would have cost to put Shoreham on line. Yet a new power plant will have to be built on Long Island soon. Meanwhile the region's economy remains highly vulnerable to future increases in oil prices. If Mr. Cuomo succeeds in destroying Shoreham, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would have to share the blame. It has judged Shoreham safe, by licensing it to operate at low power, but has done little to prevent New York's subversion of its emergency planning rules, or to rebuild public confidence in nuclear power after the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. Countries like France and Japan already generate substantial portions of their electricity by nuclear power without exciting extreme public fears. But this country has fallen far behind in nurturing a nuclear energy option. When the next crunch in oil prices comes, Americans will be least prepared. Then, for all the good it will do, they can blame the lethargy of the Reagan Administration and the political timidity of leaders like Governor Cuomo.",1988-05-13T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,opinion

Over the last 50 years, some $145 billion in federal research and development subsidies has gone to the nuclear industry; only $5 billion has gone to renewable energy sources. Meanwhile, a substantial portion of the costs of operating a nuclear plant are imposed on communities.

Entergy recently went on record opposing backup power to emergency sirens, yet it seems to have ample funds for advertising campaigns designed to lull the public into a false sense of security.

Here on the Normandy coast, France is building its newest nuclear reactor, the first in 10 years, costing $5.1 billion. But already, President Nicolas Sarkozy has announced that France will build another like it. Flamanville is a vivid example of the French choice for nuclear power, made in the late 1950s by Charles de Gaulle, intensified during the oil shocks of the 1970s and maintained despite the nightmarish nuclear accidents of Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. Nuclear power provides 77 percent of France’s electricity, according to the government, and relatively few public doubts are expressed in a country with little coal, oil or natural gas. With the wildly fluctuating cost of oil, anxiety over global warming from burning fossil fuels and new concerns about the impact of biofuels on the price of food for the poor, nuclear energy is getting a second look in countries like the United States and Britain. Even Germany, committed to phasing out nuclear power by 2021, is debating whether to change its mind. France is way ahead. Électricité de France, or EDF, is in talks to buy British Energy, for about $24 billion, to renovate Britain’s nuclear plants and build new ones. The French have already contracted to build a third-generation European Pressurized Reactor of the Flamanville type  the world’s safest and most powerful  in Abu Dhabi and China. There is pride in French exceptionalism and in the technical skill that has produced an industry with no major accidents. In a recent op-ed article in Le Figaro, for example, Yves Thréard boasted: “France hasn’t any oil, but she knew how to exploit a rich idea. In the whirlwind of globalization, civil nuclear power became a weapon, commercial and political, that allowed the country to remain at the avant-garde in the concert of nations.” A senior aide to Jean-Louis Borloo, the minister of ecology, sustainable development and planning, said that France “sees a wide trend developing” toward more use of nuclear energy. “A lot of countries realize that with the rising price of fossil fuels and energy, and the climate emergency, nuclear can be part of the solution,” said the aide, who spoke anonymously under the rules of his ministry. He said that France’s choice for a “closed fuel cycle”  reprocessing used nuclear fuel to recover plutonium made in the reactors so it can be reused  was safer. “This way, nuclear energy can bring a lot  it’s CO2-free energy.” Mr. Sarkozy said that each European Pressurized Reactor that “replaces a gas-powered electricity plant saves two billion cubic meters of gas each year, and each E.P.R. replacing a coal plant means cutting 11 million tons of CO2.” France generates half of its own total energy, up from 23 percent in 1973, despite increased consumption. Electrical power generation accounts for only 10 percent of France’s greenhouse gases, compared with an average of 40 percent in other industrialized countries, according to EDF. France has 58 operating nuclear reactors, the highest number of any nation besides the United States. In America, where nuclear construction has been moribund, there is also new interest. At the moment, 19.4 percent of the electricity generated in the United States is from 104 nuclear plants, according to the Department of Energy. The Nuclear Regulatory Agency has in hand or expects applications to build 34 reactors, of which seven are European pressurized water reactors of the Flamanville type  and, unlike current American reactors, allow output to vary to meet fluctuating demand. The Flamanville reactor is based on a French-German design, which itself is based on an earlier Westinghouse design. EDF has an American partner, Constellation Energy, to sell the new model as a joint venture called UniStar Nuclear, which has already ordered some of the larger parts for one reactor. Ironically, its main competitor is Westinghouse, now owned by Toshiba. For all the happy talk in France, however, there are continuing doubts and confusion about nuclear power, accentuated by a series of accidents and alerts in July. At a nuclear plant in Tricastin, in Provence, 163 pounds of untreated uranium in liquid leaked from a faulty tank during a draining operation, seeping into the ground and then into rivers that flow into the Rhône. While the two-year-old Authority for Nuclear Security, an independent body overseeing civilian nuclear activities, called it a category one (out of seven) incident that posed no health risk, the local prefect banned fishing, irrigation, swimming and the use of well water. The ban lasted 14 days, and the government criticized Areva, the nuclear group that is mostly state-owned, for not informing local authorities quickly or adequately. The treatment station, which was old, was being replaced, and remains shut. Other minor accidents occurred in quick succession: a burst underground pipe at another site north of Tricastin, which leaked a tiny amount of uranium inside plant grounds, and then another accident at Tricastin itself, when 100 employees were contaminated by radioactive particles that escaped from a pipe. The government, Areva and EDF have played down the accidents. Mr. Borloo said there were 86 category-one nuclear incidents in France in 2007 and 114 in 2006. Mr. Borloo’s aide, pointing to the Authority for Nuclear Security, said the Tricastin “microevent” showed that “our system of security is extremely responsive and transparent, and that the media and public opinion needed a training period to understand how the system of nuclear security works in France.” Still, there is continuing nervousness. Sales of bottled water increased, and even a nearby appellation of local wine, Côteaux du Tricastin, is exploring whether to change its name, according to Henri Bour, who runs the local wine council. A prominent French anti-nuclear lobby, Sortir du Nucléaire, is pressing to phase out nuclear power, which it considers too dangerous and too expensive because of the need to manage nuclear waste. The group wants a “sustainable transition” to renewable energy options like solar, hydro and wind power. Last year, on the 21st anniversary of the Chernobyl meltdown, 30 protesters at Flamanville blocked entrances and chained themselves to cranes. There have also been some construction issues. In April, the Authority for Nuclear Safety criticized some of the welds and the quality of the concrete work at Flamanville, but work resumed in June. Philippe Leynié, the site manager here for EDF, said the problem involved missing pins on the metal rebar and was not serious. Nonetheless, an IFOP opinion poll conducted for Le Monde after the Tricastin leaks showed that 67 percent of the French considered it vital to keep nuclear power in the country’s energy mix, compared with 52 percent in 2002. Only 27 percent judged the risks of nuclear energy to be the most worrying, compared with 50 percent who thought global warming was the predominant risk. In 2002, 33 percent worried most about nuclear risks and only 20 percent about global warming. For Flamanville, though, a village of 1,780 people, nuclear power has re-energized the town. There are no pretty beaches here, just granite cliffs above a cold sea. For hundreds of years, the village lived off the granite, cutting and selling it, shipping it first by boat, then by railroad. Flamanville granite, said Mayor Patrick Fauchon, was used to pave the Place de la Concorde in Paris. But by the middle of the 19th century it became too expensive compared with other sources, and the village survived by digging iron from an undersea mine, said Mr. Fauchon, who has been mayor since 1983. “It was always a company town,” he said. But the mine closed in 1962, and the population of the village dropped to 1,150 people. When the idea of a nuclear plant arose, in 1975, there was considerable debate. But residents voted for the nuclear plant, which meant new jobs. The granite cliffs and cold sea, while not hospitable to bathers, were ideal for these nuclear reactors, which need a hard foundation and access to plentiful cold water. Now, after so many years, a generation of workers here has already retired from the nuclear industry. “At the regional level, some towns accept having nuclear plants and others oil refineries,” Mr. Fauchon said. “I don’t ask Bretons if they’re happy about having pigsties and raising pigs, which creates another source of pollution.” Still, he thinks these days of the effect on towns that are losing their regiments as France’s military modernizes. “At least when we speak of energy, it’s a permanent need,” Mr. Fauchon said. “When we speak of an industrial tool with a lifespan of 60 years, we have economic activity for two generations.”",2008-08-16T22:16:02.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-europe

Yet, over the past few years, both here and abroad, the nuclear industry has had to pay millions of dollars in claims for compensation for atomic workers who died of cancer many years after they left the employ of the industry. While we have yet to see, and may not for 20 years, the full effects of the accident at Three Mile Island, studies of and testimony by Harrisburg-area residents (most recently before the Suffolk County Legislature) have revealed the serious health problems, and even death, that have afflicted people since the accident. The World Health Organization, the National Cancer Institute and scientists who do not owe their livelihoods to the nuclear establishment have acknowledged that exposure to ionizing radiation, such as that released by nuclear power plants, is a leading cause of cancer. So have well-documented studies commissioned, and largely ignored, by a Federal Government hell-bent on promoting this fatally flawed technology. But the fact remains that ''routine'' radioactive emissions are enough to induce cancer. The lack of immediately observable effects on people had led nuclear energy proponents to erroneously justify allowing people to be exposed to radiation. This ignores the latency period for gestation of cancer, leukemia and genetic diseases, which scientific studies have revealed may not begin to show up until five or more years after the radiation has been received. Dr. John Gofman, the scientist-author of ''Poisoned Power'' - who was dismissed from his job by the United States Atomic Energy Commission because, he has said, he revealed that there is no ''safe'' threshold of exposure below which radiation is harmless - writes in his book that ''for most of the serious environmental poisons, cancer at 5-25 years after the poisoning is precisely the kind of effect we must worry about,'' while ''genetic effects occurring in subsequent generations can be many times more serious than cancer.'' Unfortunately, as in the case of cancer induction, gene mutations induced by nuclear radiation may be indistinguishable from naturally occurring, or heat or chemical-induced ones. Measuring and controlling genetic damage due to radiation -which can't be seen - is virtually impossible. But, as the Nobel laureate Linus Pauling has stated: ''There can be no doubt that the radioactive material released by nuclear power stations is injurious to the human race and will cause increases in the number of children born with severe physical and mental damage.''

Jesse Jackson, speaking in Washington to the New Directions conference of Democratic activists: The fact that both countries, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., with about the same level of experience in nuclear power but with very different ways of managing it, have now had a disastrous accident tells us that the dangers of nuclear power are not derived from the quality of management, but are built into the technology itself. It tells us that the nuclear power industry is a dangerous and unnecessary way to produce electricity. It tells us that there are far better, much less dangerous, ways to produce our energy. We can produce the power we need from renewable solar sources, such as alcohol, which, produced on family farms, would help restore their economic stability as well. The Soviet accident tells us that the time has come to phase out nuclear power, to shut the plants down -beginning with the most dangerous reactors that are particularly hazardous, because they have no containment - the four in South Carolina and one in the state of Washington, which continues to produce the greatest danger of all, nuclear weapons.",1986-05-06T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,national-desk-u.s.

To the Editor: In his recommendation of nuclear power to increase the world's energy supply while protecting the environment, Dale Klein (letter, March 21) ignores the very serious problems posed by the increasing amounts of radioactive waste produced by nuclear-power plants. The best current practice involves nothing more than placing this waste in ''secure'' containers, which are buried deep in the earth in the hope that the highly dangerous radiation will eventually exhaust itself without significant or noticeable damage to the environment. Unfortunately, there is little scientific data to prove that these measures will indeed protect us adequately in 50 or 100 years. Despite assurances of nuclear-power aficionados to the contrary, the growing supply of nuclear waste we are burying may well come to be recognized as such a grave danger that, eventually, it will severely limit or put an end to expansion of nuclear-power generation. The future of nuclear power would be far brighter and much less controversial if scientists and engineers could develop practical methods of destroying or deactivating radioactivity without harming the earth, the atmosphere and human beings. Surely, there can be no greater challenge and no more worthy goal for their expertise. WILLIAM J. EIMAN Philadelphia, March 21, 1986",1986-03-29T06:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,editorial-desk-opinion

The radiation she got from her visit — about two chest X-rays’ worth — was worth the education she received on the tour, she told her 8.6 million Instagram followers. She then spoke admiringly of France, which, she said, “recycles their waste, increasing the efficiency of their system and reducing the overall amount of radioactive waste to deal with.” Progressive lawmakers, along with environmental groups like the Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense Council, have historically been against nuclear power — often focusing on the danger, longevity and storage requirements of the radioactive waste. During the 2020 presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said, “It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me to add more dangerous waste to this country and to the world when we don’t know how to get rid of what we have right now.” Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts echoed these concerns and pledged not to build any new nuclear plants if elected president. So it’s no surprise that many Americans believe nuclear waste poses an enormous and terrifying threat. But after talking to engineers, radiation specialists and waste managers, I’ve come to see this misunderstanding is holding us back from embracing a powerful, clean energy source we need to tackle climate change. We must stop seeing nuclear waste as a dangerous problem and instead recognize it as a safe byproduct of carbon-free power. Why is nuclear so important for reducing carbon emissions? The countries that have cleaned up their electricity production the fastest have generally done so with hydroelectric power, nuclear, or a combination of the two. The distinct advantage of nuclear is that it requires little land and can reliably produce lots of power regardless of weather, time of day or season. Unlike wind and solar, it can substitute directly for fossil fuels without backup or storage. The International Energy Agency believes it’s so crucial that global nuclear capacity must double by 2050 to reach net-zero emissions targets.",2023-04-28T23:20:35.000+02:00,NYTIMES,globalhome

Members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff say their superiors have tried to discredit a Justice Department investigation of the Tennessee Valley Authority's top nuclear power manager. The regulatory commission is moving toward allowing the authority's nuclear power system, shut down because of widespread questions about its safety, to resume operations. T.V.A. officials have been concerned that the investigation of the manager - on suspicion of making deliberate false statements about a reactor's safety - could stand in the way. The manager denies making false statements. Two veteran members of the regulatory commission's staff said in separate interviews that a committee of agency officials had visited the Justice Department last month and informed its criminal division that top agency officials did not believe the allegations against the T.V.A. official so they were not worth pursuing. The two staff veterans said the committee was an eight-member ''review group'' convened by James M. Taylor, deputy executive director of the commission, around the first of the year. They See a ''Sellout'' The two veterans, who charged that the committee actions amounted to a ''sellout,'' each spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fear of retaliation. Their account of the review group was confirmed by a third knowledgeable official, who also asked not to be identified. Mr. Taylor declined to speak to a reporter about the matter, and N.R.C. and Justice Department press spokesmen said their agencies would have no comment. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's investigative office spent 10 months interviewing witnesses and gathering information at T.V.A. sites before concluding that there were grounds for a criminal investigation by the Justice Department. According to the staff veterans, the review group reached the opposite conclusion in a matter of weeks by going over the commission investigators' files. The Justice Department is investigating Steven A. White, the Tennessee Valley Authority's manager of nuclear power, on suspicion of making illegal ''willful material false statements'' to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in certifying that T.V.A. reactors were in compliance with Federal safety standards. He says his statements were not false and were misinterpreted. In August 1985 all five of the T.V.A.'s operating reactors were shut down for safety deficiencies. The continuing shutdown is costing ratepayers in seven Southern states $1 million a day. The collapse of the Government utility's reactor system was due to the most widespread management and safety enforcement breakdowns in the 30-year history of civilian nuclear power. As such it was viewed by the privately owned electric utility industry as a blow to public confidence in nuclear power. Vote Soon on Reactor Mr. White, a retired admiral of the nuclear Navy, was hired by the T.V.A. in January 1986 as a highly paid outside contractor to turn around the program. The regulatory commission is expected to give approval later this month for the Sequoyah Unit 2 reactor near Chattanooga, Tenn., to resume operation. On Friday at a ''public briefing'' before the five-member Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Mr. White said an investment of $12 million and 7 million hours of engineering time had brought the Sequoyah reactor to the threshold of a nuclear power ''heat up'' and restored generating capacity. Commission members agreed that a few remaining technical questions could be resolved in a matter of days, with a vote on allowing the reactor to resume operation by midmonth. Lando W. Zech Jr., the commission chairman, praised Mr. White and urged that the T.V.A. board of directors give him ''strong support.'' After the meeting, when asked about the investigation of Mr. White, Mr. Zech said as he has before that it would not deter a favorable vote by the commission on the Sequoyah operation. The investigation did not come up during the meeting. Neither did the alleged attempt to discredit it, which was related later by the two veteran staff members. 'Not Going to Comment' Efforts to obtain comment from Mr. Taylor were unsuccessful. When his office was called, his secretary said he was ''not available.'' Asked about the Taylor committee's role, Frank Ingram, an N.R.C. spokesman, would say only, ''This is a matter still under investigation and we are not going to comment on it.'' Also noting that the White matter ''is still an open criminal investingation by the department,'' Joe Krovisky, a Justice Department spokesman, said he could not comment. Mr. White told the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in in early 1986 that the T.V.A.'s Watts Bar nuclear power plant, near Knoxville, Tenn., was in compliance with N.R.C. quality assurance safety requirements. The regulatory commission, however, found that the newly completed Watts Bar plant was in disarray and was not licensed. Under Mr. White's schedule for restoring the nuclear power system, the plant will not be ready to operate before 1990.",1988-03-06T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

The plant has been disconnected from external power at least twice before, forcing it to rely on diesel generators to power safety equipment. The availability of fuel to power the generators has long been a concern. Herman Galushchenko, Ukraine’s energy minister, said in a Facebook post on Saturday that there was only enough diesel fuel to operate the plant for about 10 days, adding that the professionalism of Ukrainian nuclear workers was now the only “safeguard against a possible nuclear accident.” Energoatom, the company that operates the plant, in a statement shortly after midnight said that the power line was damaged “due to another shelling by Russian troops.” The statement said that it is “necessary to repair and restore the operation of the communication lines of the ZNPP with the power system,” but did not say how long that is expected to take.",2022-10-08T23:36:58.000+02:00,NYTIMES,europe

The White House’s choice to replace him, Allison Macfarlane , has strong credentials as an expert on nuclear waste and weapons. She will need to be as independent and aggressive as Dr. Jaczko. Both industry and her fellow commissioners will have to be pushed to implement necessary improvements highlighted by the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan. After being hit by an unusually powerful earthquake and the tsunami it generated, Fukushima lost its connection to the off-site electrical grid and its own backup generators, making it impossible to cool the reactors to prevent a meltdown and release of radiation. Although an equally powerful earthquake and tsunami were deemed unlikely in this country, the disaster was a warning that nuclear plants must do more to anticipate previously “unthinkable” disasters and plan for ways to mitigate the damage. When it comes to nuclear power, the cost of any mistake can be truly unthinkable. In the wake of Fukushima, the commission assembled an expert task force. Last July, it offered a list of three dozen thoughtful recommendations. They included specific recommendations to upgrade safety equipment and procedures, as well as an ambitious call to revamp the current regulatory approach and replace certain voluntary provisions with mandatory requirements. Dr. Jaczko’s constant prodding in public and in private helped push the commission to set clear deadlines for taking action. It gave its staff members 24 to 30 months to develop rules to prevent the complete loss of power experienced at Fukushima. And Dr. Jaczko set a goal of implementing all of the recommendations within five years. Dr. Macfarlane will have to keep pushing for prompt and thorough action. Dr. Jaczko had been under heavy fire from fellow commissioners and Congressional Republicans for what they charged was a manipulative and abrasive management style, some of it described by the agency’s inspector general. (The Republicans have pressed for another report that may be released soon.) We’ve never been sure whether the attacks on him were mostly a cloak for policy disagreements or reflected a truly important management problem. Either way, they became a distraction. In addition to her training as a geologist and work as an academic — she is an associate professor of environmental science and policy at George Mason University — Dr. Macfarlane has welcome Washington experience. She was a member of a White House panel on the future of nuclear power and has served on National Academy of Sciences panels on nuclear power and nuclear weapons. Her nomination was applauded by nuclear watchdog groups and industry. It will likely be paired with a nomination to another term for Kristine Svinicki, a Republican commissioner and outspoken critic of Dr. Jaczko. That should enhance the chances for both to win confirmation.

On Thursday, the Union of Concerned Scientists , an environmental and nuclear watchdog group based in Cambridge, Mass., accused the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission in a report of allowing companies that operate plants to ignore, or delay repairs to, leaky pipes, electrical malfunctions and other problems that could escalate into something more serious. “It’s like the spinning wheels on a slot machine,” David Lochbaum, the author of the report and the director of the organization’s nuclear safety program, said in a prepared statement. “One ingredient showing up causes a puddle on the floor. Two ingredients yield a near miss. All three ingredients showing up can cause nuclear disaster.” The report echoes more general concerns raised on Wednesday in Congressional hearings , when the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Gregory Jaczko, fielded questions from lawmakers about the age of the nation’s nuclear plants and whether safety and oversight procedures needed to be revisited. David McIntyre, a spokesman for the commission, said the fact that the organization had reports of problems to scrutinize suggested that the regulatory system was working. “We have resident inspectors stationed full time at each plant,” Mr. McIntyre said, “and if they say our inspectors are catching these things then that says they’re doing their job.” The report by the Union of Concerned Scientists examined 14 instances in 2010 in which significant problems at nuclear power facilities set off special inspections by federal regulators — incidents characterized by the regulators as “near misses.” Reports on such incidents are made available publicly by the regulatory commission. Twelve of the events involved lingering safety problems, among them leaky roofs and floods near safety equipment, faulty pumps, rusty pipes, fires and inadvertent shutdowns. Two others involved compromises in plant security, though details on those were not made public. Special inspections are typically done when a problem increases the possibility of nuclear core damage by a factor of at least 10. But the report’s authors said operators should be catching and repairing those problems long before the commission orders a special inspection. The 14 special inspections involved plants in 12 states and nine corporate owners, including large players like Exelon, Duke Energy, and Pacific Gas & Electric. Progress Energy, a utility operating five nuclear facilities in the Carolinas and Florida, was singled out as being particularly problematic, with four of its plants being among the 14 that required special inspections. In one instance described in the report, a high-voltage power cable at Progress Energy’s Robinson Nuclear Power Plant, near Hartsville, S.C., failed, causing a fire. “Hours after the fire had been put out, workers re-energized the cable that had started it all,” Mr. Lochbaum said. “It was still failed, and ignited a second fire.” Responding to the report, Mike Hughes, a spokesman for Progress Energy, said: “We have the highest safety standards for our nuclear plants and our employees, and we work continuously to improve safety. We remain focused on addressing each of the events last year that led to special inspections. Questions of risk and emergency preparedness at nuclear power plants have gained new prominence globally as people watch the operators at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan fight to stave off a full-scale nuclear meltdown. Nuclear regulators and Obama administration officials have said that they are watching the situation in Japan closely and that they will harvest any lessons as they become clear. But in a conference call in which he discussed Thursday’s report, Edwin Lyman, a senior scientist with the Union of Concerns Scientists, argued that one such lesson was already at hand: the need for a wider evacuation zone around American nuclear plants. Mr. Lyman criticized a recommendation on Wednesday by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that Americans in Japan remain at least 50 miles away from the Fukushima Daiichi plant, which Mr. Jaczko, the commission chairman, said was leaking radiation at rates far higher than Japanese government officials had suggested. Mr. Lyman suggested that the commission was being hypocritical: the official evacuation zone surrounding nuclear power plants in the United States is only 10 miles, although critics have long urged that it be increased. The agency “should not be using different standards for Americans abroad than it does at home,” Mr. Lyman said. Citing plants like the Indian Point nuclear plant, about 35 miles north of New York City, Mr. Lyman, a physicist and member of the Institute of Nuclear Materials Management , called it “utterly unrealistic” to expect that a parallel evacuation could be undertaken should a disaster like the earthquake or tsunami in Japan occur in the United States. But Mr. McIntyre, the regulatory commission spokesman, said the agency continued to believe that a 10-mile evacuation zone — required as part of the emergency protection plant at every nuclear facility in the United States — was adequate for what would be an “anticipated event.” In Japan, he emphasized, “you have a multiple-worst-case scenario.” Mr. McIntyre also noted that the standard evacuation zone for American nuclear plants was backed up by a “50-mile ingestion zone,” in which potential radiation contamination of food supplies is planned for. He said the 10-mile evacuation zone could be expanded as circumstances warranted. “However, once this is over,” Mr. McIntyre said, “we’re going to evaluating everything for lessons that can be learned, and I would be very surprised if this wasn’t one of the things that we look at.”",2011-03-18T03:22:30.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-science-environment

It was Mr. Kan’s strongest stand yet against nuclear energy in the aftermath of the multiple meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which was ravaged in the March 11 tsunami and suffered a substantial radiation leak. At least 80,000 people have been evacuated from around the plant, and radioactive materials have been detected in tap water as far away as Tokyo, as well as in agricultural produce like vegetables, tea and beef. “Japan should aim for a society that does not depend on nuclear energy,” Mr. Kan said at a nationally televised news conference. “We should reduce our dependence in a planned and gradual way, and in the future we should aim to get by with no nuclear energy.” He added, “When we think of the magnitude of the risks involved with nuclear power, the safety measures we previously conceived are inadequate.” With his popularity at a record low, however, it is unclear whether Mr. Kan can push through such an extensive overhaul of Japan’s energy policy. Nuclear power made up about 30 percent of the country’s energy needs before the Fukushima accident, and Japan had planned to raise that share to over 50 percent by 2030. Mr. Kan also left many difficult questions unanswered, including when Japan might become nuclear-free and how the nation would make up for the shortfall in energy. Alternative energy sources like wind, solar and geothermal power provide just 1 percent of Japan’s electricity needs. With growing public fears over nuclear safety, many of Japan’s reactors that were closed for regular checks have not been allowed to restart, setting off a widespread electricity shortage. Mr. Kan has said those reactors must undergo stress tests before they are reopened, but he has not provided details of how extensive those tests might be or how long they might take. Just 19 of 54 reactors in Japan are still running, and there have been increasing calls, particularly from industry, for a speedier restart. Public opinion appears to support a more cautious approach. Nearly 70 percent of Japanese oppose restarting the reactors, despite the prospect of blackouts, according to a poll published on June 27 by The Nikkei, Japan’s largest business daily. In a June 14 poll by the daily Asahi Shimbun, 74 percent of respondents said they supported a policy that would phase out nuclear power with a goal to abandon it. Mr. Kan has also taken an increasingly antinuclear stance. In May , he ordered an aging nuclear power plant closed over earthquake and tsunami fears, and he said he would freeze plans to build new reactors. His moves have not appeared to win him support among voters, however. A July 4 Mainichi Shimbun poll showed support for his cabinet at 19 percent, a low. Mr. Kan, 64, has said he will step aside for a younger successor once he has made some headway in efforts to rebuild in the aftermath of Japan’s recent disasters. The prime minister’s move to redefine Japan’s nuclear policy comes amid a wider reconstruction effort since the earthquake and tsunami. Communities along Japan’s northern Pacific coast have been devastated; more than 22,000 people are estimated to be missing or dead.",2011-07-13T16:02:46.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

At least three electric utilities have told Federal regulators of secret labor settlements with workers at nuclear power plants that might be interpreted as buying their silence, Government records indicate. The three utilities, GPU Nuclear Corporation of Parsippany, N.J., Duke Power Company of Charlotte, N.C., and Omaha Public Power District, disclosed the arrangement in response to an inquiry by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The regulatory agency in the past has been criticized in Congress for not banning such arrangements. The issue stemmed from a Senate investigation last spring of two labor settlements between builders of the Comanche Peak nuclear power plant in Texas and workers who received payments in return for not making public potential safety hazards. The Labor Department later ruled that such settlements were unacceptable, but the agency has been publicly divided over how and whether to outlaw them. Settlements Called Unacceptable Last April the regulatory agency sent letters to all nuclear utilities and their contractors asking to be told of any labor settlements that restricted an employee's ability to report safety concerns. Duke Power, which operates power plants in North Carolina and South Carolina, was the only utility to provide specific information about a settlement. It said it felt compelled to report the case to the agency ''in light of the sensitivity of the issue,'' although it does not believe the settlement is improper. The case involves an April 1988 settlement with a former employee, Howard Samuel Nunn Jr., who filed a civil suit against Duke after his dismissal in October 1983. In its letter to the regulatory agency, Duke quoted two paragraphs from the settlement that it suggested might raise questions about buying Mr. Nunn's silence. 'Free' to Contact Commission It stipulated that Mr. Nunn not voluntarily appear as a witness in any legal or administrative proceeding and that he not ''seek to induce any Government agency'' to take action. Duke told the agency these passages were meant to settle the Nunn suit. The deal ''clearly left Mr. Nunn free to bring any concerns to the N.R.C. if he so desired,'' Duke said in its letter. Similar language in a Comanche Peak labor settlement earlier this year, however, has been criticized as creating the impression that a worker could not contact the agency about safety concerns. Bob Newlin, a spokesman for the regulatory agency, said today the commission, based on the responses from Duke and other utilities, wrote letters to people involved in questionable settlements. GPU Nuclear, in its letter to the agency, said that while it found no restrictive clauses in its labor settlements, the language in two agreements ''might be misconstrued to restrict the individual's ability to raise potential safety issues.'' The utility, which owns the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania and the Oyster Creek plant in New Jersey, gave no details of the settlements but said it sent letters to the people involved advising them to disregard any language that they thought limited their ability to raise safety issues. Omaha Public Power District, owner of the Fort Calhoun nuclear plant in Nebraska, said it found two labor settlements that might be viewed as restricting the reporting of safety concerns. It said the people involved were notified that they should feel free to go to the commision with such concerns.",1989-10-24T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

The decision to close the Connecticut Yankee plant, in Haddam Neck on the Connecticut River about 20 miles southeast of Middletown, could signal that similar plants, including New York's Indian Point 3, may also be imperiled by changing economics and the availability of abundant power from non-nuclear sources, power industry experts said. Except for Shoreham on Long Island, which was never fully operational, Connecticut Yankee would be the first commercial plant in Connecticut, New York or New Jersey to close in 22 years. Although it is the oldest active commercial nuclear plant in the United States, Connecticut Yankee generated power more than 71 percent of the time in its 28 years of service, putting it in a performance category with many plants half its age. But lately, Federal nuclear inspectors had identified a spate of safety problems at the plant and three others in Connecticut -- Millstone 1, 2 and 3 -- run by its primary owner, Northeast Utilities. Connecticut Yankee was taken out of service in July because of safety problems noted by the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission. More problems cropped up in late summer, including an incident over the Labor Day weekend in which cooling water in the reactor dropped four feet, nearly causing the fuel to overheat. The plant will never generate power again. All three Millstone reactors remain temporarily shut down. But safety issues did not weigh in the decision to close the reactor, Bruce D. Kenyon, president of Northeast's nuclear division, said yesterday. ''It's all about economics,'' Mr. Kenyon said. ''We looked at the value of the plant to our customers over its remaining lifetime and concluded that the right economic choice was to leave the unit shut down.'' In October, an economic analysis by Northeast Utilities and seven other New England utilities that share power from the plant showed that about $100 million could be saved by dismantling it and buying power from sources outside the state. Connecticut customers can expect a drop in rates, company officials said, although the amount is not yet clear. Weighing against the plant were rising operating costs and the economics of scale, with the 582-megawatt reactor only about 60 percent as powerful as more modern reactors but requiring 350 workers to monitor its complicated systems, company officials said. It also provided only a small portion of the total electricity supplied by each of its eight owners -- only 4 percent of the power sold by Northeast Utilities. The biggest factor in the decision was simply that adequate power for all the utilities could be found from non-nuclear sources for at least the next six to eight years, Anthony J. Castagno, a spokesman for Northeast Utilities, said. With only 10 years left on its license, the plant simply could not compete, he said. The next step will be the slow decommissioning of the plant and mothballing of its fuel until the Federal Government decides on a permanent disposal site, officials at Northeast Utilities said. The process could take seven years and cost more than $400 million, Mr. Castagno said. The costs have already been factored into the savings projected for closing the plant, he said. Everything will be dismantled except the storage area for the hazardous nuclear fuel. Some of the 350 workers will be shifted to other jobs with the utilities that own the plant, with others offered severance packages, he said. Northeast Utilities has just begun a similar economic study to determine the future of Millstone 1, the oldest reactor at its complex in Waterford. But Mr. Kenyon said the 25-year-old plant, which is younger, larger and a more critical part of the company's generating capacity, would likely remain in operation. He said the decision to close Connecticut Yankee was unlikely to make waves in the industry as a whole because specific factors applied there. ''Every plant has its own economics; every utility has its own economics,'' he said. But some critics of the nuclear power industry whose main concern is environmental risks said they were certain that the conditions that led to the closing of Connecticut Yankee would lead other utilities to close faltering plants as well. Ashok Gupta, an economist and energy expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private environmental group, said the trend toward deregulation of utilities -- by allowing power to flow from cheap sources to hungry markets like the Northeast -- would make it harder for utilities to keep nuclear plants going by simply saddling consumers with the added costs. Now, he said, it is investors in utilities who will absorb any extra costs, and they are much less forgiving of bad choices. ''They will govern these investments more in the future,'' he said. But some people in the nuclear industry insisted that nuclear plants would remain a bulwark of the American power grid into the next century. Over all, electricity bought wholesale from other sources is still more costly than power from a well-run nuclear plant, said Steven W. Unglesbee, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry group in Washington. ''Our production costs have dropped 34 percent in the last decade and we expect to improve further,'' he said.",1996-12-05T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,front-page

The concern was tempered by Western experts' assertions that Soviet nuclear safety planning is the world's worst and by the fact that the design of the Chernobyl reactor differs significantly from most Western plants. Still, there were enough similarities to give officials, experts and critics pause. For one thing, the Soviets established an evacuation zone of 18 miles around the stricken plant, according to various reports. That is 80 percent more than the American emergency planning zone and comes at a time when the nuclear industry is insisting that 10 miles is too large. Immediately, opponents of the Shoreham nuclear plant on crowded Long Island intensified their opposition to that plant's operation. For another, there were reports that the Russian accident started with a loss of off-site power, followed by a loss of on-site emergency power to run safety equipment. That issue has been a heated one in this country, with Federal regulators repeatedly criticizing the reliability of backup diesel generators. Experts also have concluded that the Soviet reactor's explosion was probably caused by hydrogen produced during the accident. Dangerously large amounts of hydrogen were also produced during the accident at Three Mile Island, and the matter is a continuing cause for concern among safety officials. And there were disclosures that 9 of the 115 large reactors in the United States have major design features similar to the Ukraine unit - either the lack of a full containment building to trap escaping radiation or a reactor core of graphite, which burned out of control at Chernobyl. It didn't take some critics long to point out that, with Chernobyl, nuclear accidents seem to be getting worse, and ever closer to the worst-case scenarios. ''Once again, this accident has brought home the idea that, when you build a commercial nuclear power plant, you decide to accept the risk, however small, of killing a few thousand people,'' said Robert D. Pollard, a former staff member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and now a nuclear safety engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group critical of nuclear regulation. ''It's clear that we have to spend more money to render nuclear power more safe.'' To a Western nuclear industry that has spent hundreds of millions of dollars improving safety since Three Mile Island, such comments are particularly rankling. ''Our reactors are pretty darn safe,'' said Dr. Carl Walske, president of the Atomic Industrial Forum, the trade association. ''We see nothing coming out of this accident to revise that estimate.'' The notion that the Soviet accident does not have much bearing on Western units has been reinforced by that country's attitude toward nuclear power. Many experts say the Russians were guilty of the same kind of optimism that pervaded the nuclear industry here before Three Mile Island, the chemical industry before the Bhopal disaster and the space establishment before the Challenger. ''The Soviets have had a certain technological hubris,'' said Dr. Robert H. Randolph, an expert on science at the National Council for Soviet and Eastern European Research. ''They simply believed it was possible to design things so well that they didn't have to worry about risk.'' Moreover, discussion of nuclear safety is not widespread in the Soviet Union, and many believe the lack of openness has hurt. ''People do better on safety in an open system where the public, the Congress, the regulators, the whole package is looking over their shoulders,'' Dr. Walske said. Nonetheless, Chernobyl is expected to spur some changes, both in the United States and the Soviet Union. ''I think this accident will have a serious impact on the whole evacuation issue in this country,'' said Dr. Thomas B. Cochran, a nuclear physicist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a research and lobbying group. ''How do you justify a 10-mile evacuation when the Russians, with little regard for public safety, evacuated to 18 miles?'' The Russians, besides making major changes in their own expanding nuclear program, will have to assuage Soviet bloc and other nations to which they sell reactors. Dr. Alfred Schneider, a professor of nuclear engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said he believes the Russians may change their entire reactor safety philosophy to more closely approximate the Western ''defense in depth'' strategy. But that will require billions of dollars in equipment at a time when the Soviet economy is squeezed for cash. Whatever the changes, the accident has again underscored the dangers of less than constant vigilance for a power source that now supplies 15 percent of the world's electricity. ''Nuclear power is a tremendously difficult technology with many potential problems,'' said Darrell G. Eisenhut, a senior official of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ''Management just has to pay attention all the time.''",1986-05-04T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,week-in-review-desk-week-in-review
df7dfa9d-4743-4adc-b24a-5b616d54dcad,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/business/global/shunning-nuclear-plants-at-home-japan-pursues-building-them-overseas.html,Japan Courts The Money In Reactors,"TOKYO — Even as Japan plans to phase out nuclear power as too risky for domestic use, the government is supporting a new push by Japanese industry to sell nuclear power technology to other countries. Japanese industrial conglomerates, with the cooperation of the government in Tokyo, are renewing their pursuit of multibillion-dollar projects, particularly in smaller energy-hungry countries like Vietnam and Turkey. The effort comes despite criticism within Japan by environmental groups and opposition politicians. It may seem a stretch for Japan to acclaim its nuclear technology overseas while struggling at home to contain the nuclear meltdowns that displaced more than 100,000 people. But Japan argues that its latest technology includes safeguards not present at the decades-old reactors at the stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant, which continues to leak radiation. While Fukushima Daiichi could not withstand the magnitude 9 quake and the tsunami that ravaged much of Japan’s northeast coast in March, Japanese officials argue, their nation has learned valuable lessons — and has good nuclear track record withstanding most earlier earthquakes. “Many countries of the world are seriously exploring the use of nuclear power, and we have assisted them in improving nuclear safety,” Japan’s new prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, said at an address at the United Nations General Assembly recently. “We will continue to answer to the interest of those countries.” Mr. Noda’s government considers foreign reactor projects a way to help stimulate Japan’s export-led economy, which had been struggling even before March’s natural and nuclear disasters. Tokyo’s backing— including financial assistance to the customer countries — has become critical in negotiating deals, especially as global confidence in nuclear safety has faltered in Fukushima’s wake. The World Nuclear Association, a trade industry group, says the world’s stock of 443 nuclear reactors could more than double in the next 15 years, but analysts say that expansion will require strong support from the governments on both sides of any deal. In early September, after a six-month hiatus following the earthquake, the Japanese government restarted talks with Vietnamese officials on a 1 trillion yen ($13 billion) project to build two reactors in southern Vietnam. The terms include possible Japanese financial aid. The project would involve a new government-supported company whose largest shareholder is Tokyo Electric Power, operator of the damaged Fukushima Daiichi plant. The industrial conglomerates Toshiba and Hitachi, which supplied reactors to the Fukushima plant, are also investors. Ichiro Takekuro, a former executive of Tokyo Electric, is the president of the new company, called International Nuclear Energy Development of Japan. The Vietnam project, if it proceeds, would join a roster of about two dozen other nuclear plant projects that Japanese makers are bidding or working on in countries including the United States, China, Turkey and Lithuania. Japan’s nuclear drive is a contrast to the recent announcement by Siemens, Europe’s largest engineering conglomerate, that it would stop building nuclear power plants. Siemens, with headquarters in Munich, is responding to Germany’s decision this year to phase out nuclear power — largely in reaction to Japan’s calamity. But makers of nuclear reactors from other countries, including Areva of France, General Electric of the United States, Russia’s state-owned Rostacom and several government-backed Chinese conglomerates like China National Nuclear, are pursuing new contracts. Within Japan, Tokyo’s effort has already drawn protest from nuclear opponents. “The Japanese government’s promotion of nuclear exports is clearly a double standard and a mistake,” the environmental group Friends of the Earth Japan, said in September. The opposition Liberal Democratic Party has also called for more debate on the nuclear export initiative by Mr. Noda and the ruling Democratic Party, although opinion in both parties remains divided. “Some people are asking: Why is Japan trying to export something it rejected at home?” said Itsunori Onodera, a Liberal Democratic lawmaker and director of a parliamentary foreign policy panel charged with approving bilateral nuclear agreements. “Even if Japan ultimately does decide to continue nuclear exports, there needs to be more debate on the issue.” But analysts say Japan’s top three nuclear engineering companies — Hitachi, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toshiba — which had combined profit in their energy and infrastructure businesses of about 242 billion yen ($3.14 billion) in the latest fiscal year, are keener than ever to look overseas. Only about one in five of Japan’s 54 reactors — which previously met about 30 percent of Japan’s electricity needs — is still in service. The rest were damaged by the tsunami, are still being put through routine tests, or have not been restarted after such tests because of local opposition. It is unclear when any will restart. Adding to the uncertainty, on Oct. 4 a reactor in Genkai, in southern Japan, went into automatic shutdown because of problems with its cooling system. And because the government has said it will be difficult for new reactors to be built, a gradual phase-out of nuclear power is inevitable, as old reactors are retired. But Japan is still intent on keeping industrial exports afloat at a time when the country’s export-led economy faces strong headwinds: a strong yen that makes Japanese goods and services expensive on world markets, post-Fukushima energy shortfalls and stiffening competition from Asian industrial rivals. Expensive projects like new reactors, often accompanied by ancillary business for utilities in fuel operations and maintenance, remain particularly attractive to Japanese commerce officials. Last year, Japan’s nuclear exports totaled 15 billion yen. The ruling Democratic Party had made the expansion of nuclear exports a centerpiece of its economic growth strategy before March. A trip by the former prime minister, Naoto Kan, to Vietnam last October, which gave the country a leg-up in negotiations, was seen as an early triumph. And when Mr. Kan himself tried to shut down efforts to continue nuclear exports in July, many within his own party urged him to reconsider. If anything, Mr. Kan’s successor and fellow Democrat, Mr. Noda, is more actively promoting nuclear exports than Mr. Kan did. The trade minister under Mr. Noda, Yukio Edano, who now oversees Japan’s nuclear policy, had been a vocal supporter of continued nuclear exports. Vietnam says it is happy that the deal is back on the table. Vietnam’s ambassador to Japan, Nguyen Phu Binh, told the Mainichi newspaper in late August that he wanted to see construction proceed and believed Japan would “use the Fukushima crisis to learn important lessons.” Still, some Japanese companies have been forced to withdraw their nuclear bids in the wake of Fukushima. Toshiba and Tokyo Electric withdrew from a proposed effort to expand the nuclear South Texas Project south of Houston, after the operator NRG Energy said it would scuttle the plan in light of the Fukushima crisis. The Toshiba-Tokyo Electric team also abandoned a bid to build Turkey’s second nuclear power plant after the Turkish government indicated that it was interested in a different kind of technology than the boiling water reactors that are Toshiba’s specialty. Older versions of boiling water reactors were in use at Fukushima. But that could benefit yet another Japanese company, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which specializes in so-called pressurized water reactors, a technology in which Turkey has shown interest. Mitsubishi has already won contracts to build three nuclear reactors in the United States, two in Texas and one in Virginia. Japanese politicians, however, have stalled some potential overseas nuclear projects. Parliament recently postponed the approval of a nuclear agreement with Jordan that could allow Japan to bid on a planned nuclear power plant there. One reason: the proposed site is far away from any large body of water, giving the plant no reliable way to cool its reactors to prevent a meltdown in the case of an emergency. “After Fukushima,” Mr. Onodera said, “we felt that could be a problem.”",2011-10-10T23:27:47.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-global-business

Nuclear power experts expressed concern today at a new directive by President Reagan that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission prepare plans to take control of civilian nuclear plants in a national emergency. The executive order, one of two issued Friday involving nuclear plants, is intended to provide material for atomic weapons if the national security is threatened. Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, chairman from 1961 to 1971 of what was then called the Atomic Energy Commission and is now the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, was among a number of experts outside the Government who questioned the order. The experts said that preparing plans to seize civilian power plants could signal the end of the clear delineation between civilian and military uses of American nuclear technology, a distinction that has been observed for four decades. The Government has had the authority to take control of the civilian nuclear power industry in a national emergency since 1954, when the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 was amended for the first time. But current and former Government officials say the new order provides, for the first time, explicit directions for agencies to draw up plans to take over the industry. 'Dramatic and Eye-Catching' ''This is a rather dramatic and eye-catching action,'' said Dr. Seaborg, who is now chairman of the Lawrence Hall of Science at the University of California at Berkeley. ''If plans are prepared and actually used, it would be a watershed event, because it would obliterate the line between peaceful uses of atomic energy and military uses.'' The top spokesman for the Engergy Department, C. Anson Franklin, said the order does not represent a change in policy. ''One should not assume that the Government has plans to take over civilian nuclear reactors,'' he said. Neither Mr. Franklin nor the top spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission could say which agency sponsored the provisions about taking over the civilian industry. Nor was it known today why such a plan would be useful to the Government. But Mr. Franklin denied today that the provisions were inserted into the executive order to address severe problems in the nation's nuclear weapon industry. ''This is not a result of current difficulties in our weapon plants,'' he said. He added that department officials, up to the Deputy Secretary, were not familiar with the order and did not ''recognize it as a significant departure from past practices.'' An official with the National Security Council said the order has been under development since 1982. Civilian reactors could be useful for military purposes because their waste products include plutonium and other materials used in nuclear weapons. At many civilian reactors, spent fuel rods containing these materials are stored in water to prevent the release of radioactive emissions. In 1981 the Administration proposed using the spent fuel rods as a source of plutonium for weapons. But this was prohibited by Congress a year later, in an amendment that could be overidden in a national emergency. The new executive order was one of two issued Friday affecting civilian nuclear plants. The other centered on the Federal Government's role in preparing emergency evacuation plans around civilian reactors. The executive order requiring the drafting of plans to take over civilian plants was intended to update a previous order issued in 1969 by the Nixon Administration and amended in 1979 by the Carter Administration. The provisions on seizing civilian plants are some of the most striking changes from previous orders. In the new order, President Reagan directed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to prepare detailed plans so that in a national security emergency the agency, with assistance from officials from Departments of Energy and Defense, could suspend operating licenses, enter power plants, operate civilian commercial reactors and capture spent fuel rods and other nuclear materials for use in manufacturing atomic weapons. Neither the 1969 executive order nor the 1979 order contains provisions about the takeover of the civilian nuclear power industry. Several experts outside Government said that the Administration's action might be interpreted as defying the spirit of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which the United States signed in 1968. The treaty included provisions that were intended to prevent the diversion of materials produced by civilian reactors for use in nuclear weapons. ''Is it appropriate to use atoms-for-peace programs for military purposes?'' said Dr. Thomas B. Cochran, a physicist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group in Washington. ''Is this something we want to encourage other nations to follow, including countries that do not produce nuclear weapons but have large civilian industries and potential national emergencies?'' 'This Is Really Strange' ''This is really strange,'' said David Albright, a staff scientist at the Federation of American Scientists, an arms control group in Washington. ''I have to wonder if this is part of a game plan to get new facilities built as quickly as possible. And you can convince Congress to build them if they see a national emergency lurking out there.'' The chief spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has regulated the civilian nuclear power industry since 1975, said today that senior officials he was able to reach today were not familiar with the executive order. ''We will have to review it,'' said the spokesman, Joseph J. Fouchard. ''If we're being directed to develop a plan to take over commercial power plants, then we'll take a look at it and go from there.'' Safety concerns have led to the closing of two weapon plants in recent weeks in Ohio and South Carolina and the partial closing of two other plants in Colorado and Washington State. Moreover, a new radioactive waste repository in New Mexico remains closed, threatening programs at other Energy Department weapon plants that were to start shipping dangerous nuclear wastes there last month. z",1988-11-21T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

Today, they are scrambling to hire atomic contractors, buy nuclear hardware and build support for a regional system of reactors. So, too, Turkey is preparing for its first atomic plant. And Egypt has announced plans to build one on its Mediterranean coast. In all, roughly a dozen states in the region have recently turned to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna for help in starting their own nuclear programs. While interest in nuclear energy is rising globally, it is unusually strong in the Middle East. ''The rules have changed,'' King Abdullah II of Jordan recently told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. ''Everybody's going for nuclear programs.'' The Middle East states say they only want atomic power. Some probably do. But United States government and private analysts say they believe that the rush of activity is also intended to counter the threat of a nuclear Iran. By nature, the underlying technologies of nuclear power can make electricity or, with more effort, warheads, as nations have demonstrated over the decades by turning ostensibly civilian programs into sources of bomb fuel. Iran's uneasy neighbors, analysts say, may be positioning themselves to do the same. ''One danger of Iran going nuclear has always been that it might provoke others,'' said Mark Fitzpatrick, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, an arms analysis group in London. ''So when you see the development of nuclear power elsewhere in the region, it's a cause for some concern.'' Some analysts ask why Arab states in the Persian Gulf, which hold nearly half the world's oil reserves, would want to shoulder the high costs and obligations of a temperamental form of energy. They reply that they must invest in the future, for the day when the flow of oil dries up. But with Shiite Iran increasingly ascendant in the region, Sunni countries have alluded to other motives. Officials from 21 governments in and around the Middle East warned at a meeting of Arab leaders in March that Iran's drive for atomic technology could result in the beginning of ''a grave and destructive nuclear arms race in the region.'' In Washington, officials are seizing on such developments to build their case for stepping up pressure on Iran. President Bush has talked privately to experts on the Middle East about his fears of a ''Sunni bomb,'' and his concerns that countries in the Middle East may turn to the only nuclear-armed Sunni state, Pakistan, for help. Even so, that concern is tempered by caution. In an interview on Thursday, a senior administration official said that the recent announcements were ''clearly part of an effort to send a signal to Iran that two can play this game.'' And, he added, ''among the non-Iranian programs I've heard about in the region, I have not heard talk of reprocessing or enrichment, which is what would worry us the most.'' The Middle East has seen hints of a regional nuclear-arms race before. After Israel obtained its first weapon four decades ago, several countries took steps down the nuclear road. But many analysts say it is Iran's atomic intransigence that has now prodded the Sunni powers into getting serious about hedging their bets and, like Iran, financing them with $65-a-barrel oil. ''Now's the time to worry,'' said Geoffrey Kemp, a Middle East expert at the Nixon Center, a Washington policy institute. ''The Iranians have to worry, too. The idea that they'll emerge as the regional hegemon is silly. There will be a very serious counterreaction, certainly in conventional military buildups but also in examining the nuclear option.'' No Arab country now has a power reactor, whose spent fuel can be mined for plutonium, one of the two favored materials -- along with uranium -- for making the cores of atom bombs. Some Arab states do, however, engage in civilian atomic research. Analysts caution that a chain reaction of nuclear emulation is not foreordained. States in the Middle East appear to be waiting to see which way Tehran's nuclear standoff with the United Nations Security Council goes before committing themselves wholeheartedly to costly programs of atomic development. Even if Middle Eastern nations do obtain nuclear power, political alliances and arms-control agreements could still make individual states hesitate before crossing the line to obtain warheads. Many may eventually decide that the costs and risks outweigh the benefits -- as South Korea, Taiwan, South Africa and Libya did after investing heavily in arms programs. But many diplomats and analysts say that the Sunni Arab governments are so anxious about Iran's nuclear progress that they would even, grudgingly, support a United States military strike against Iran. ''If push comes to shove, if the choice is between an Iranian nuclear bomb and a U.S. military strike, then the Arab gulf states have no choice but to quietly support the U.S.,'' said Christian Koch, director of international studies at the Gulf Research Center, a private group in Dubai. Decades ago, it was Israel's drive for nuclear arms that brought about the region's first atomic jitters. Even some Israeli leaders found themselves ''preaching caution because of the reaction,'' said Avner Cohen, a senior fellow at the University of Maryland and the author of ''Israel and the Bomb.'' Egypt responded first. In 1960, after the disclosure of Israel's work on a nuclear reactor, Cairo threatened to acquire atomic arms and sought its own reactor. Years of technical and political hurdles ultimately ended that plan. Iraq came next. But in June 1981, Israeli fighter jets bombed its reactor just days before engineers planned to install the radioactive core. The bombing ignited a global debate over how close Iraq had come to nuclear arms. It also prompted Iran, then fighting a war with Iraq, to embark on a covert response. Alireza Assar, a nuclear adviser to Iran's Ministry of Defense who later defected, said he attended a secret meeting in 1987 at which the commander in chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said Iran had to do whatever was necessary to achieve victory. ''We need to have all the technical requirements in our possession,'' Dr. Assar recalled the commander as saying, even the means to ''build a nuclear bomb.'' In all, Iran toiled in secret for 18 years before its nuclear efforts were disclosed in 2003. Intelligence agencies and nuclear experts now estimate that the Iranians are 2 to 10 years away from having the means to make a uranium-based bomb. It says its uranium enrichment work is entirely peaceful and meant only to fuel reactors. The International Atomic Energy Agency's concerns grew when inspectors found evidence of still-unexplained ties between Iran's ostensibly peaceful program and its military, including work on high explosives, missiles and warheads. That combination, the inspectors said in early 2006, suggested a ''military nuclear dimension.'' Before such disclosures, few if any states in the Middle East attended the atomic agency's meetings on nuclear power development. Now, roughly a dozen are doing so and drawing up atomic plans. The newly interested states include Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, Yemen and the seven sheikdoms of the United Arab Emirates -- Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Al Fujayrah, Ras al Khaymah, Sharjah, and Umm al Qaywayn. ''They generally ask what they need to do for the introduction of power,'' said R. Ian Facer, a nuclear power engineer who works for the I.A.E.A. at its headquarters in Vienna. The agency teaches the basics of nuclear energy. In exchange, states must undergo periodic inspections to make sure their civilian programs have no military spinoffs. Saudi Arabia, since reversing itself on reactors, has become a whirlwind of atomic interest. It recently invited President Vladimir V. Putin to become the first Russian head of state to visit the desert kingdom. He did so in February, offering a range of nuclear aid. Diplomats and analysts say Saudi Arabia leads the drive for nuclear power within the Gulf Cooperation Council, based in Riyadh. In addition to the Saudis, the council includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates -- Washington's closest Arab allies. Its member states hug the western shores of the Persian Gulf and control about 45 percent of the world's oil reserves. Late last year, the council announced that it would embark on a nuclear energy program. Its officials have said they want to get it under way by 2009. ''We will develop it openly,'' Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, said of the council's effort. ''We want no bombs. All we want is a whole Middle East that is free from weapons of mass destruction,'' an Arab reference to both Israel's and Iran's nuclear programs. In February, the council and the I.A.E.A. struck a deal to work together on a nuclear power plan for the Arab gulf states. Abdul Rahman ibn Hamad al-Attiya, the council's secretary general, told reporters in March that the agency would provide technical expertise and that the council would hire a consulting firm to speed its nuclear deliberations. Already, Saudi officials are traveling regularly to Vienna, and I.A.E.A. officials to Riyadh, the Saudi capital. ''It's a natural right,'' Mohamed ElBaradei, the atomic agency's director general, said recently of the council's energy plan, estimating that carrying it out might take up to 15 years. Every gulf state except Iraq has declared an interest in nuclear power. By comparison, 15 percent of South American nations and 20 percent of African ones have done so. One factor in that exceptional level of interest is that the Persian Gulf states have the means. Typically, a large commercial reactor costs up to $4 billion. The six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council are estimated to be investing in nonnuclear projects valued at more than $1 trillion. Another factor is Iran. Its shores at some points are visible across the waters of the gulf -- called the Arabian Gulf by Arabs and the Persian Gulf by Iranians. The council wants ''its own regional initiative to counter the possible threat from an aggressive neighbor armed with nuclear weapons,'' said Nicole Stracke, an analyst at the Gulf Research Center. Its members, she added, ''felt they could no longer lag behind Iran.'' A similar technology push is under way in Turkey, where long-simmering plans for nuclear power have caught fire. Last year, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for three plants. ''We want to benefit from nuclear energy as soon as possible,'' he said. Turkey plans to put its first reactor near the Black Sea port of Sinop, and to start construction this year. Egypt, too, is moving forward. Last year, it announced plans for a reactor at El-Dabaa, about 60 miles west of Alexandria. ''We do not start from a vacuum,'' President Hosni Mubarak told the governing National Democracy Party's annual conference. His remark was understated given Cairo's decades of atomic research. Robert Joseph, a former under secretary of state for arms control and international security who is now Mr. Bush's envoy on nuclear nonproliferation, visited Egypt earlier this year. According to officials briefed on the conversations, officials from the Ministry of Electricity indicated that if Egypt was confident that it could have a reliable supply of reactor fuel, it would have little desire to invest in the costly process of manufacturing its own nuclear fuel -- the enterprise that experts fear could let Iran build a bomb. Other officials, especially those responsible for Egypt's security, focused more on the possibility of further proliferation in the region if Iran succeeded in its effort to achieve a nuclear weapons capability. ''I don't know how much of it is real,'' Mr. Joseph said of a potential arms race. ''But it is becoming urgent for us to shape the future expansion of nuclear energy in a way that reduces the risks of proliferation, while meeting our energy and environmental goals.''",2007-04-15T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

Upstate legislators will not deprive their low-income communities of the cheap electric power crucial to their industrial base because wealthy Long Island has a dislike for nuclear fission and coal burning. Electric power from Canada is also an empty promise. Canada has already contracted out all the power it can supply on a firm basis. Canada will only sell us its surplus power and will not guarantee when or if there will be a surplus. The power shortage is not coming, it is here. Last June there were selective low-voltage brownouts and companies that depend on computers suffered loss of data. Electric motors can tolerate short periods of low voltage, but a computer loses all the data stored in temporary memory in a flash of voltage fluctuation. Obviously, the situation will get worse as Long Island continues to grow and the Long Island Rail Road extends its electric-train service. Long Island simply doesn't have the luxury of continuing to pander to the imaginary fears that have been holding up the Shoreham nuclear plant. Nuclear power plants have been in America for decades. They have a perfect record of protecting the public from harm. Thirteen percent of the nation's electric power is now nuclear and the nuclear plants under construction will boost that above 20 percent. The Governor's office and the Suffolk County bureaucracy have responded to the electricity shortage with the slogan: ''You can't evacuate Long Island.'' Every nuclear plant in the nation is functioning with a 10-mile evacuation plan. Many of those nuclear power stations are close to large cities that present evacuation problems far more severe than Long Island's. County officials know the evacuation problem faced by Suffolk is modest compared with other areas that have plans that are successfully in place. They have developed and approved their own 10-mile evacuation plan that they refuse to test. All Suffolk County need do is join the rest of the world and implement its own workable 10-mile evacuation plan. At this stage of the game that will take some courage. Perhaps the facts below will stiffen some backbones. No one can seriously question the feasibility of moving people who live in a 10- or 20-mile radius in a day or two. Stories abour rush-hour interference are just plain nonsense. In any emergency, traffic is suspended. All lanes of all highways are directed away from the problem. The highway system of Long Island could easily move people the necessary distance. Note: Nuclear emergencies take days or weeks to develop. Only a confirmed obstructionist will insist that Long Island cannot join the nuclear 20th century because we Long Islanders become a hysterical mob in time of trouble. Suffolk County's greatest fear seems to be that a test of its evacuation plan will prove to be a resounding success. Whatever motivates Suffolk County legislators' opposition to the Shoreham plant, it cannot be fear of nuclear power. They have shown no concern about the three-reactor complex in Millstone, Connecticut, less than 20 miles from Long Island. Callousness and disregard for Long Island's need for an adequate source of electric power are centered in the Suffolk County Legislature and the Governor's office. Now state and county bureaucrats have adopted harmful, insensitive policies toward consumers. The New York State Consumer Protection Board, part of the bureaucracy, is one of the foxes in the chicken coop. The question is: Do we need another bureaucracy to watch the bureaucrats, or can this one summon up the courage to look around and do something about the bad company it is keeping?",1985-04-28T09:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,long-island-weekly-desk-new-york

Safety is a concern that needs to be uppermost in the minds of those in the headlong rush to institute a “nuclear renaissance.” It’s not. The cost of nuclear power and the radioactive waste it produces are two other critical issues. And there are more, like the threat of terrorism and the likelihood of nuclear weapons proliferation when there are more reactors in countries with unstable political environments. We would be much better off if we took the huge federal loan guarantees for nuclear power and used them for renewable-energy and energy-efficiency programs. There would be a significantly greater and faster return. We should be looking toward a true “decarbonization” of our energy economy. This would create more jobs, more quickly and at less cost, and provide significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions much sooner. William F. Hewitt New York, July 21, 2010 The writer has a blog about climate change for the Foreign Policy Association and teaches at New York University’s Center for Global Affairs .  To the Editor: Contrary to the speculation in Bob Herbert’s column, the nation’s nuclear energy facilities are well prepared to protect public health and safety. The nuclear energy industry operates under the premise that things can go wrong; it designs its plants and trains personnel to respond safely and effectively to unlikely scenarios like major system malfunctions and security threats. Additionally, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires the industry to be prepared to protect public health and safety during worst-case events. Every nuclear plant in the United States is required to have emergency plans, procedures and notification systems at the ready 24/7 should an emergency occur. Every plant is also required to regularly perform emergency and security drills that the N.R.C. grades. A “defense in depth” safety design, which protected public health when the Three Mile Island accident occurred, is built into nuclear plant structures and operating systems. Many subsequent improvements in personnel training and operational practices have made nuclear energy a reliable contributor to the nation’s economic well-being. The hundreds of companies engaged in the industry stake their success and reputation on one another’s commitment to safety. Marvin Fertel President and C.E.O. Nuclear Energy Institute Washington, July 23, 2010  To the Editor: The need for more nuclear power plants brings with it a compelling need for a new focus on safety. That is one reason we should consider a new kind of reactor: an accelerator-driven subcritical reactor , known as A.D.S.R., driven by a superconducting particle accelerator like those used in physics research. A.D.S.R. stations would generate power cheaply by burning thorium, uranium or waste from conventional reactors. They would do so safely and cleanly, producing minimal waste and no byproducts useful to terrorists. Their subcritical operation would be inherently safe because an accelerator can simply be switched off. India, with its large thorium reserves, is way ahead in considering this opportunity. However, at the United States Energy Department laboratories, at universities and at companies, development of new nuclear technologies is being led by scientists and engineers who are eager to apply their skills to humanity’s energy, climate and security challenges. Rolland Johnson Batavia, Ill., July 20, 2010 The writer is president of Muons, a company that is developing concepts and technologies for high-energy physics research and for other accelerator applications like A.D.S.R.",2010-07-29T07:11:59.000+02:00,NYTIMES,letters-opinion

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is imposing new regulations designed to strengthen protection against terrorist attacks at plants handling material that is capable of being used in nuclear weapons. The rules will immediately affect five plants, four of which make highly enriched fuel for nuclear-powered submarines and aircraft carriers. A Congressional critic called the new security precautions ''totally inadequate'' because they do not apply to the nation's 110 nuclear power plants. Those reactors do not handle material for weapons but may be vulnerable to sabotage. The commission said the new requirements will include bolstered security measures to guard against the possible use of vehicles to break into plants or to cause damage with car or truck bombs; night target practice for guards; searches of personnel and packages; posting of armed guards at points where nuclear material changes hands, and additional barriers around protected areas. Four Plants Initially Affected The requirements initially will affect four plants, operated by GA Technologies at La Jolla, Calif.; Nuclear Fuel Systems at Erwin, Tenn.; Babcock & Wilcox at Lynchburg, Va., and United Nuclear Corporation at Uncasville, Conn. The plants in Erwin, Lynchburg and Uncasville produce fuel for submarines and aircraft carriers that is highly enriched and could be converted for use in bombs. The La Jolla plant processes enriched fuel for other purposes. One or two additional plants may be affected in the near future, the commission said. A commission announcement said the decision to require the new measures was based on a recent study that compared security requirements for plants handling strategic nuclear material with a security system the Department of Energy recently employed for comparable plants. 'Totally Inadequate' The commission plan was sharply criticized by Representative Sam Gejdenson, a Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the Interior subcommitte on oversight and investigations, which has held hearings on the threat of sabotage and terrorism to commercial nuclear power plants. ''It's totally inadequate,'' Mr. Gejdenson said. ''While it increases the precautions taken at a select few nuclear facilities regulated by the N.R.C., it leaves the bulk of our 110 nuclear power plants with a standard for protection against terrorist attacks which is totally unrealistic. ''After two years and more of reviewing the security at nuclear facilities, I think the N.R.C. frankly hasn't fulfilled its responsibilities to the American people and to the nuclear community.'' Alan Kuperman, issues director for the Nuclear Control Institute, a Washington-based public interest group, also was critical of the new regulations because they do not apply to nuclear power plants. ''This is certainly a step in the right direction,'' Mr. Kuperman said. ''It could well be adequate as far as theft goes. But perhaps the greater danger is the threat of radiological sabotage from an attack on a reactor.''",1988-12-08T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

The East German Government said today that a power plant on its Baltic coast had suffered the country's ''most serious and grave'' nuclear accident in 1976, and that a single pump might have prevented the reactor's radioactive core from melting down after a fire. East German officials telephoned the West German Environmental Ministry today and gave details of the accident, which occurred at the Lubmin nuclear power plant on the Baltic coast near Greifswald. Until a few weeks ago, such information was treated as a state secret in East Germany. A West German official said this was the first time East German officials had ever told the West German Government about any nuclear problems. ''The German Democratic Republic's Office for Atomic Safety and Radiation Protection telephoned us and confirmed that an accident, which they described as the most serious and grave in the history of the G.D.R., had occurred at the Lubmin plant in 1976,'' said Marlene Muhe, chief spokesman for the Environmental Ministry. She said East German officials had said they would send complete details of the accident, but had not discussed all aspects of it in their conversations today. First Reported by Der Spiegel Der Spiegel, a West German weekly news magazine, reported Sunday that the radioactive reactor core in the Lubmin plant nearly melted down when almost all the reactor's safety systems failed during a fire in 1976. Government officials and industry experts said the conversations today between East and West German officials substantiated many of the details in that report. ''If the details prove correct, then the East Germans were very lucky,'' said a West German nuclear physicist, who asked not to be identified. ''At a certain critical temperature, the chain reaction can no longer be controlled, even if the fuel cells in the core are isolated. Beyond that temperature, meltdown will commence, and everything basically becomes fuel for the reaction.'' Der Spiegel said a Chernobyl-scale nuclear disaster was prevented only when a single water pump in the emergency cooling system was able to draw off pressurized water heated to high temperature by the ''decay heat'' left in the reactor's core, thus preventing a meltdown. The pump had been connected to an auxiliary power supply while it was being repaired. The fire destroyed the cables providing normal and emergency power to the reactor, causing five of the six water pumps in the emergency cooling system to fail. Six other pumps also failed for lack of power. Safety a Volatile Issue Nuclear safety is a volatile issue in East Germany. Parts of the country, along with wide areas of northern Europe, were hit by the high levels of radioactive contamination released by the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Soviet Union in 1986. Some East German environmentalists have called for demolition of the country's five existing nuclear plants and the six under construction in East Germany. Nuclear power accounts for about 10 percent of East Germany's annual electrical production. West Germany, which has 22 plants in operation and two research reactors, gets 29.6 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources. Industry experts in West Germany said the near-miss at Lubmin was probably the result of a generic flaw in the design of older-model Soviet nuclear reactors.",1990-01-23T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,world
dd8659cb-aeb8-5fac-9a0a-38ae2202dcea,https://www.tipsproject.eu/tips/,Energy Bill Aids Expansion of Atomic Power,"WASHINGTON, July 30  A one-sentence provision buried in the Senate’s recently passed energy bill, inserted without debate at the urging of the nuclear power industry, could make builders of new nuclear plants eligible for tens of billions of dollars in government loan guarantees. Lobbyists have told lawmakers and administration officials in recent weeks that the nuclear industry needs as much as $50 billion in loan guarantees over the next two years to finance a major expansion. The biggest champion of the loan guarantees is Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the ranking Republican on the Senate Energy Committee and one of the nuclear industry’s strongest supporters in Congress. Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico and the energy bill’s author, has long argued that nuclear power plants do not need federal loan guarantees. Mr. Bingaman said that the industry was over-interpreting the provision and that it would provide loan guarantees for only the most innovative power plants. But the provision has the potential to considerably expand the nuclear industry, which plans to build 28 new reactors at an estimated cost of about $4 billion to $5 billion apiece. And while the nuclear industry would be the biggest beneficiary, the provision could also set the stage for billions of dollars in loan guarantees for power plants that use “clean coal” technology and renewable fuels. The nuclear industry is enjoying growing political support after decades of opposition from environmental groups and others concerned about the risks. An increasing number of lawmakers in both parties, worried about global warming and dependence on foreign oil, support some expansion of nuclear power. But the provision could go much further than many lawmakers had in mind by giving the Department of Energy the power to approve an unlimited amount of loan guarantees for “clean” power generation. Under legislation enacted in 2005, nuclear power qualifies as a clean technology because it does not emit carbon gases that contribute to global warming. Power companies have tentative plans to put the 28 new reactors at 19 sites around the country. Industry executives insist that banks and Wall Street will not provide the money needed to build new reactors unless the loans are guaranteed in their entirety by the federal government. The federal government guarantees many billions of loans each year to help farmers, exporters, small businesses and students. The government does not actually lend the money but agrees to pay it back in case the borrower defaults. While the nuclear industry says it will need $25 billion in loan guarantees in 2008 and $50 billion over the next two years, President Bush had proposed a far smaller amount  $4 billion  in new loan guarantees next year for “clean” electric power technologies, which include plants that run on so-called clean coal technologies and renewable fuels. Many experts fear that the proposed subsidies could leave taxpayers responsible for billions of dollars in soured loans. “Such projects, by their nature, pose significant technical and market risks,” the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office warned last month in an analysis of the provision. “Studies of the accuracy of cost estimates for pioneering technologies have found that estimates are consistently low.” Michael J. Wallace, the co-chief executive of UniStar Nuclear, a partnership seeking to build nuclear reactors, and executive vice president of Constellation Energy, said: “Without loan guarantees we will not build nuclear power plants.” The little-noticed provision in the Senate bill subtly refines and expands the loan guarantee program that Congress passed in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. As before, the Department of Energy would be allowed to guarantee 100 percent of the loans and up to 80 percent of the total cost to build a reactor. But the bill essentially allows the department to approve as many loan guarantees as it wants for both new reactors and plants that use other “clean” technologies. That is a big change. Under current law, the government is only allowed to guarantee a volume of loans authorized each year by Congress. Last year, Congress limited the government to awarding just $4 billion in loan guarantees for clean energy projects during the 2007 fiscal year. Mr. Domenici, who has been pushing the Energy Department to move much more aggressively in approving loan guarantees, has argued that there is no need for limits on the loan volume because power companies will be required to pay an upfront fee to cover the estimated cost of the guarantee. In essence, the “credit subsidy” payments would be used as a kind of insurance premium that could be used to cover the cost of any defaulted loan. “It is very clear that this is a self-financing program,” Mr. Domenici told James Nussle, Mr. Bush’s nominee to become the White House budget director, at Mr. Nussle’s confirmation hearing last week. “There should already be $25 billion to $30 billion in the loan guarantee fund.” But the Bush administration opposes the measure, fearing that it could prove extremely costly. The provision would “remove appropriate controls over the size of the program and increase taxpayer liability,” the Office of Management and Budget wrote in an official position statement on the energy bill. Michele Boyd, legislative director of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, said the measure would subsidize plants with conventional technology. “None of these so-called ‘advanced’ nuclear reactors deal with the fundamental flaws of nuclear power, such as dangerous radioactive waste, vulnerabilities to air attack and excessive cost,” said Ms. Boyd, whose staff began investigating the provision shortly after the Senate passed the bill last month. Mr. Bingaman, the bill’s primary architect, said that he was aware of the provision but believed that it would apply only to reactors with fundamentally new technology. “I would be amazed if this generic loan program applied to most of the plants that are being proposed, either for the nuclear industry or coal industry,” Mr. Bingaman said Monday night. “The idea of this is not just to help an industry build plants. It’s to demonstrate new technology that meets the nation’s energy needs.” But industry officials say the measure would directly affect the reactors on the drawing board. “I think we can say that with all the projects moving forward on the schedule they are now on, that there could be a need for $20 to $25 billion in loan guarantees,” said Richard Myers, vice president for policy development at the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade association. The House is hoping to pass its own energy bill this week. But leading House Democrats have made it clear they oppose any kind of loan guarantees for nuclear reactors. The House recently passed an appropriations bill for energy and water programs that included $7 billion in loan guarantees for projects involving renewable energy and specifically excluded nuclear plants. Representative Peter J. Visclosky, Democrat of Indiana and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee’s panel on energy and water, said last month that the nuclear industry had estimated a need of $25 billion in guaranteed loans for next year and “more than that” in 2009. The industry’s request, Mr. Visclosky warned, “overwhelms” what the committee had been willing to offer the entire energy industry. Still, nuclear industry executives say they hope the Senate’s loan guarantee provision will be adopted by House lawmakers.",2007-07-31T06:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,washington

The Pilgrim nuclear reactor began low-power testing Friday after receiving final Federal clearance nearly three years after it was shut down and labeled one of the country's worst-run power plants. The Boston Edison Company, the owner, said the reactor was restarted about 6 P.M., with the withdrawal of control rods in the reactor. The restarting began a program intended to take the plant to full power in about four months, said Ralph Bird, Boston Edison senior vice president for nuclear power. The plant would require another review by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission before it can be granted permission to operate at full power. Twenty-seven people protesiting the restart were arrested today outside the plant on tresspassing charges. Opposition to restarting Pilgrim has been intense, with state officials pledging to do everything they can to keep the plant from operating. State officials say an emergency evacuation plan for towns around the plant is inadequate despite revisions. They also say the plant should not reopen until a study of leukemia rates in the population surrounding the plant is complete. ''We will do whatever we possibly can legally, through the attorney general, to insure that the plant doesn't operate,'' said Martie Barnes, a spokeswoman for Gov. Michael S. Dukakis. ''We still believe the plant is not ready for restart.'' Mr. Bird said the utility would continue to work with state and local officials to complete and improve the evacuation plan. At the time Pilgrim was shut over management problems in April 1986, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission called the plant ''one of the worst-run'' nuclear plants in the country. Boston Edison has spent about $200 million since the shutdown to replace nearly all the plant's top management, work on mechanical problems and fight skepticism by the commission and a growing anti-nuclear movement among nearby residents. In a letter dated Friday, William T. Russell, the commission's Regional Administrator, gave permission for the plant to operate, saying the technical issues raised in the shutdown had been resolved. The decision cleared the way for low-power testing of the 670-megawatt reactor, for operating at up to 5 percent of its capacity. If the plant keeps to schedule, consumers can receive power from Pilgrim when it hits 10 percent operating capacity sometime next month. By the end of January, the plant should be at about 25 percent of power, producing 100 megawatts daily, or enough electricity to power 160,000 homes, said Elaine Robinson, a Boston Edison spokeswoman. Massachusetts Citizens for Safe Energy, an anti-nuclear group, called the reopening ''a slap in the face to local and state government officials and a direct threat to thousands of people living near the Pilgrim nuclear plant.'' ''There are increasing signs that Pilgrim has caused leukemia in nearby residents,'' the group said in a statement. Boston Edison officials said there was no evidence that radiation from the plant had caused any cancer deaths. Citizens for Safe Energy also said the plant should not be brought to full power because ''Pilgrim's history of management and safety failures has continued despite N.R.C. and Edison claims to the contrary.'' Ms. Robinson said: ''We're confident that we're proceeding in a very safe and responsible manner and we wouldn't proceed if we didn't think it was safe. It's important to realize how many of us live right here with our families.'' In October 1987, Governor Dukakis and Attorney General James Shannon, citing evacuation and safety concerns, asked the Federal agency to revoke Pilgrim's operating license. The request was formally denied Thursday in a letter from Thomas E. Murley, director of the commission's Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.",1989-01-01T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

The reduction in output might result from the war’s interference with operation of the plants, which require a wealth of industrial supplies and care. The cutbacks, Western experts say, may spiral into rolling blackouts that could further cripple the beleaguered country. “To put it simply, nuclear power plants are not designed for war zones,” James M. Acton, a nuclear analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in a recent report. Ukraine’s nuclear facilities could, he added, “become targets in a war that will, in any case, disrupt their operations.” Ukraine has four sprawling complexes in different parts of the country that host its 15 operational reactors. The disconnections from the nation’s power grid are being reported by the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine, which is in Kyiv and files daily updates. For instance, on Feb. 1 it reported that all of Ukraine’s nuclear reactors were sending power into the electrical grid. It is not unusual for individual reactors to go offline for maintenance and other purposes. In contrast, starting this past Sunday, three days into the invasion, the state agency began reporting an unusual rate of disconnection: Six of the nation’s 15 reactors were offline. The inspectorate’s updates give bare-bones facts and no reasons for the outages.",2022-03-01T22:55:58.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

For years, it met one-third of its electricity needs with nuclear power, similar to Japan’s level of dependence before the 2011 disaster at its Fukushima plant . Now, a snowballing scandal in South Korea about bribery and faked safety tests for critical plant equipment has highlighted yet another similarity: experts say both countries’ nuclear programs suffer from a culture of collusion that has undermined their safety. Weeks of revelations about the close ties between South Korea’s nuclear power companies, their suppliers and testing companies have led the prime minister to liken the industry to a mafia. The scandal started after an anonymous tip in April prompted an official investigation. Prosecutors have indicted some officials at a testing company on charges of faking safety tests on parts for the plants. Some officials at the state-financed company that designs nuclear power plants were also indicted on charges of taking bribes from testing company officials in return for accepting those substandard parts. Worse yet, investigators discovered that the questionable components are installed in 14 of South Korea’s 23 nuclear power plants. The country has already shuttered three of those reactors temporarily because the questionable parts used there were important, and more closings could follow as investigators wade through more than 120,000 test certificates filed over the past decade to see if more may have been falsified. In a further indication of the possible breadth of the problems, prosecutors recently raided the offices of 30 more suppliers suspected of also providing parts with faked quality certificates and said they would investigate other testing companies. “What has been revealed so far may be the tip of an iceberg,” said Kune Y. Suh, a professor of nuclear engineering at Seoul National University. With each new revelation, South Koreans — who, like the Japanese, had grown to believe their leaders’ soothing claims about nuclear safety — have become more jittery. Safety is the biggest concern, but the scandals have also caused economic worries. At a time of slowing growth, the government had loudly promoted its plans to become a major builder of nuclear power plants abroad. The scandal, Professor Suh said, “makes it difficult to continue claiming to build reliable nuclear power plants cheaply.” South Koreans say they are already suffering for the industry’s sins. The closing of the three reactors, in addition to another three offline for scheduled maintenance, has led the country’s leaders to order a nationwide energy-saving campaign in the middle of a particularly muggy summer. At university campuses, students have deserted the libraries for cooler Internet cafes, and major corporations have turned down air-conditioning. President Park Geun-hye has kept off her own air-conditioning even when she hosted foreign guests, including Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook. And some entrepreneurs have capitalized on the troubles, selling “cool scarves” made of a special fabric that, after being dipped in water, keeps wearers cool for hours. But the modeling and creativity have not stopped the grousing, or alleviated anger at the industry. Critics of South Korea’s nuclear industry say there were plenty of warning signs. Last year, the government was forced to shut down two reactors temporarily after it learned that parts suppliers — some of whom were later convicted — had fabricated the safety-test certificates for more than 10,000 components over 10 years. But the government emphasized at the time that those parts were “nonessential” items and that the industry was otherwise sound. As it turned out, the problems went much deeper. The investigation that began this spring suggested that the oversight within the supply chain may also be more deeply compromised. A company that was supposed to test reactor parts skipped portions of the exams, doctored test data or even issued safety certificates for parts that failed its tests, according to government investigators. And this time the parts involved included more important items. Among the parts that failed the tests were cables used to send signals to activate emergency measures in an accident. “This is not a simple negligence or mistake; this is a deliberate fabrication by those who were supposed to safeguard the reliability of parts,” said Kim Yong-soo, a professor of nuclear engineering at Hanyang University in Seoul. “It raises serious questions about the immune system of our nuclear power industry.” Although much remains unclear with the investigations under way, experts say they know enough to pinpoint the underlying cause of the scandal: an industry that is even more highly centralized than Japan’s, with poor oversight on the relations among the major players. While Japan has a small number of utilities that provide nuclear power, South Korea has just one: the state-run Korea Electric Power Corporation, or Kepco. One of its subsidiaries, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power, runs all the plants. Another, Kepco Engineering & Construction, designs them and is tasked with inspecting parts from suppliers and vetting the safety certificates they include from testing companies. Over the years, senior retirees from the two subsidiaries have found jobs with parts suppliers and testing companies or invested in them, according to industry data submitted to the National Assembly. In a culture where honoring personal ties is often considered more important than following regulations, the porous borders among the members of the supply chain resulted in what government officials and industry experts call an “entrenched chain of corruption.” Important school and hometown connections among the groups further cemented the collusive links, they said. And then there is the lure of bribery, which has often lubricated relationships between South Korean parts suppliers and their buyers in various industries. “In the past 30 years, our nuclear energy industry has become an increasingly closed community that emphasized its specialty in dealing with nuclear materials and yet allowed little oversight and intervention,” the government’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said in a recent report to lawmakers. “It spawned a litany of corruption, an opaque system and a business practice replete with complacency.” In the current scandal, Korea Hydro officials are accused of ordering Kepco E & C to ignore faked certificates from the testing firm Saehan Total Engineering Provider Company. The testing company’s top officials and investors included current and former employees from Kepco E & C or their family members. (Although the company was called for comment several times in recent days, no one picked up the main line.) But the problems appear to go beyond testing. At the home of one of the Korea Hydro officials, investigators found boxes of cash amounting to several hundred thousand dollars. Investigators tracing the origin of the money recently arrested officials of Hyundai Heavy Industries, a major parts supplier, on bribery charges. Prosecutors said the money was meant to ensure contracts for Hyundai Heavy and appeared not to be part of the scandal over testing certificates. In a statement jointly issued in June, Korea Hydro, Kepco E & C and two other state-financed nuclear industry companies promised “self-purification measures.” To “root out corruption arising from collusive ties,” they said they would make it mandatory for senior officials to make public their personal assets, ban all employees from buying stocks in suppliers or getting jobs there after retirement, and reduce the retirement package benefits for those fired for corruption. Amid a public uproar, the government fired the heads of both the Kepco subsidiaries. It also promised to enact new laws and tighten regulations to ban retirees from the two subsidiaries from getting jobs at suppliers and test agencies. Political opposition parties, which control some seats on the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission — the top nuclear watchdog, which has long been criticized as being too cozy with the industry — recently added two critics of nuclear power to the regulatory group. But many worry the changes, and promised changes, will not be enough. After last year’s scandal, the government had vowed to keep parts suppliers found to have falsified documents from bidding again for 10 years. But in February, Korea Hydro imposed only a six-month penalty for such suppliers. And nuclear opponents say that more fundamental changes are needed in the regulatory system, pointing out that one of the government’s main regulating arms, the Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety, gets 60 percent of its annual budget from Korea Hydro. Some go further, saying ordinary South Koreans will have to change their own expectations before real change can occur. The nuclear industry, they say, was built around the notion that South Korea’s industries needed inexpensive power, leading Kepco to build plants quickly and operate them cheaply. “South Koreans have guzzled cheap electricity while turning a blind eye to the safety concerns of their nuclear power plants,” said Yang Lee Won-young, a leader at the Korean Federation for Environmental Movement. “They may end up paying dearly.”",2013-08-03T22:36:35.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

A government agency warned, however, that without the seven plants Germany could have trouble coping with a failure in some part of the national power grid. The shutdown “brings networks to the limit of capacity,” the Federal Network Agency, which regulates utilities, said in a report published Friday. Meeting in Wernigerode, in eastern Germany, the state environment ministers recommended that the seven plants be closed. The decision rests with Chancellor Angela Merkel and her cabinet, which will consider the issue on June 6. Mrs. Merkel is under heavy political pressure to speed Germany’s exit from nuclear power after public alarm about the nuclear disaster in Japan cost her party votes in recent elections. In late March, a few weeks after the tsunami and earthquake hit Japan and led to the crisis at Fukushima, the Green Party, representing environmentalists, drove Mrs. Merkel’s Christian Democrats from power in Baden-Württemberg, a state the conservatives had dominated for decades. The Green Party is pushing for Germany to close all of its plants by 2020 if not sooner. “An exit during this decade is very doable,” Franz Untersteller, the environment minister in Baden-Württemberg, said in a statement Friday. But businesses have expressed concern that the price of electricity could rise because Germany does not yet have enough other sources of energy to compensate. The Federal Network Agency, in its report Friday, said Germany had transformed from energy exporter to energy importer since the nuclear plants were shut down. When weather is ideal, Germany can generate almost as much power from wind and solar energy as 28 nuclear reactors, the agency said. The renewable energy fluctuates significantly, however, often requiring German utilities to buy power from other countries and creating problems for neighbors that had depended on German power. The Federal Network Agency acknowledged that so far there had been no serious power failures since the seven plants were closed.",2011-05-27T23:36:08.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-global-business

Most spent fuel repositories do not have a hardened containment vessels, like reactors themselves. This makes the repositories vulnerable to terrorist sabotage, which could lead to significant radiation releases. We have seen at Fukushima how serious a lack of cooling can be for spent fuel. An additional problem is that American spent fuel pools were never intended for long-term storage and are holding more spent fuel than they were designed for. Mark Swann Washington • To the Editor: Much of the angst about power generation, especially nuclear power, could be alleviated by adopting a less centralized strategy. Huge generating installations have been built because they appear to be cheaper and more efficient, but this is true only if the widespread risk of failure and fragile public support is downplayed. New technology allows power production more locally, either in towns (as was done historically in local conventional power plants) or in the household (solar or wind generation). Costs per kilowatt-hour might be somewhat higher, but these generators are intrinsically safer. Martin S. Ewing Branford, Conn. • To the Editor: “Idiotic” would be a more accurate than “probabilistic” as a characterization of the risk model used by the nuclear industry. The Indian Point nuclear power plant, 24 miles from New York City, exemplifies the defiance of common sense. The plant has an extensive history of safety problems, including fires, explosions, cooling system malfunctions, backup generator failures, emergency communication system breakdowns, pipe breaks and radiation leaks. A few years back, testing revealed that a fire protection system for critical electrical cables was defective, subject to rapid disintegration and a potential threat to safe reactor shutdown in the event of fire. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission simply recalibrated potential fire duration to 24 minutes and gave Indian Point an exemption to federal fire safety rules. (The nuclear plant fire which had led to the rules, by the way, had lasted nearly seven hours.) Michel Lee Scarsdale, N.Y.",2011-04-05T01:59:59.000+02:00,NYTIMES,science-science

Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts to appear before it later this month to oppose its proposal to ease the licensing of nuclear power plants. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said today that it would permit Governor Cuomo of New York and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts to appear before it later this month to oppose its proposal to ease the licensing of nuclear power plants. The commission also said it would depart from normal procedure by delaying until after the hearing a preliminary decision on formally publishing the rule change in the Federal Register. ''This is an unusual procedure because of the unusual interest in the proposal,'' said Joseph Fouchard, a commission spokesman. ''The commission ordinarily does not hold such hearings before it has formally published a proposal.'' The hearing is scheduled for Feb. 23 at 2:30 P.M. and is expected to attract wide interest because the commission's proposal to ease licensing is opposed by state and local officials. The commission said that if the five members voted later to publish the rule change in an effort to solicit public comment, the final vote to adopt or reject the rule would be delayed for ''at least two months,'' or until the end of April. On Feb. 6 the commission's staff sent the commissioners the draft of a proposed change in rules that would permit the agency to license nuclear plants such as those in Shoreham, L.I., and Seabrook, N.H., for full-power operation even if the state and local authorities have refused to participate in the planning for emergency evacuations. Since the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania in 1979, the commission, as a condition for granting a full-power license, has required the cooperative preparation of a plan to evacuate some or all residents within a 10-mile radius of each reactor in the event of an accident. The commission has also required that the plan be tested in a drill. Under the present rule, the utility operating the reactor and state and local governments are required to take part in the plan. But at the Shoreham plant, and in a growing number of areas within the 10-mile radius of the Seabrook plant that are in Massachussetts, state and local officials have refused to take part in preparation of an evacuation plan. The strategy of the state and local officials reflects both general opposition to nuclear power and, in Suffolk County, the conclusions of locally sponsored evacuation studies that the rapid evacuation of the more than 100,000 people in the area would be difficult or impossible. Although they are ready for operation, neither the Seabrook nor the Shoreham plant has been granted an operating license because of the lack of an evacuation plan. The proposed rule change, reflecting the increasing impatience of the majority of the five commissioners, would allow the owners of nuclear power reactors to draft evacuation plans that ''assume'' state and local agencies would help out in an emergency. Governor Cuomo has called the proposal ''an outrage.'' PROBLEMS AT 3 MILE ISLAND WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 (Reuters) -Unexpected problems in removing the nuclear core of the disabled Three Mile Island nuclear power plant may delay its cleanup, a report by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said today. But the report said that significant progress had been made by General Public Utilities, owner of the plant at Middletown, Pa., where there was partial nuclear meltdown in 1979. The staff report, released at a commission meeting, said about 20 percent of the damaged nuclear core had been removed and there had been good progress in decontamination of the building and equipment. But the report said that workers removing the core had run into problems never before encountered and the cleanup schedule had already slipped several times.

Two distinct tragedies with a common implication: complex technological systems, run by vast organizations, are prone to catastrophic failures that only trial and error can reveal. It is folly to presume that systems of such intricacy will always perform in accordance with design -especially those that cannot undergo real-life tests. A space-based defense against nuclear missiles is precisely that sort of system. Hence, it cannot provide reliable protection against attack. No fundamental technical hurdles block the path to safe nuclear power or manned space flight. Their problems are institutional. The thousands of people, scores of companies and web of Government agencies that plan, build and operate the power plants and manned spacecraft are confronted by competing demands of cost, schedules and safety. Often safety does not receive the attention it must have since it is an obstacle to objectives that were irresponsibly bloated to marshal public support. But nuclear power plants operate for years and yield hands-on experience with their problems. The shuttle is flown again and again, until a fatal flaw is tragically revealed. In this country, furthermore, the nuclear power industry and space program operate in the open. The inevitability of blunder brings their inner workings to light, despite the tendency of all bureaucracies to resist and even hide from their critics. In the Kremlin, astride the most op-pressive and Byzantine of bureaucracies, this syndrome finds its most pathological expression. To err is human. To cover up is also. We ignore all experience when we suppose a large enterprise, even one as outstanding as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, will correct its own mistakes. This was well understood by the Founding Fathers who, in a simpler age, designed the Constitution to aid our ability to penetrate official shields. But the Strategic Defense Initiative will face neither realistic testing nor traditional ''checks and balances.'' The Administration proposes to put a swarm of ''battle stations'' into space. There they would wait for years, always at the ready to counter a nuclear attack. An automated battle station, with its panoply of lasers, mirrors and targeting instruments, is easily as complicated as a nuclear power plant. In terms of complexity, our ''Star Wars'' shield would be analogous to a flotilla of orbiting nuclear plants that must cooperate with the precision of a symphony orchestra. With what confidence could a network of nuclear power stations be simultaneously turned on while itself under nuclear attack - stations that had never operated singly, let alone together, in such an environment? That question gives a rough measure of the task faced by the Initiative. The Pentagon would pursue this mission in secrecy, knowing that its products cannot be put to realistic test short of nuclear war. No human life would be taken by meltdowns or defective O rings. The compulsion to ignore problems and doubts would have a free run. Whistle-blowers would be intimidated, blunders classified. No one would have any idea of how the shield would actually perform under attack. In short, there is a vast gulf between a technology that is to work in benign surroundings and one that must operate under nuclear attack. No hostile power is spending billions on fiendish schemes for disrupting our nuclear power plants, whose problems are solely our responsibility. But billions of rubles would be devoted to fooling and destroying our shield in space. And what those rubles can do cannot be known until the very first time that shield must protect us, without any last-minute request to Moscow for a postponement if we're not quite ready for World War III. All this is clear to our military leaders. They will refuse to rely on an untried strategic defense as the first line of defense. They know that a dream cannot dispel the harsh realities that emanate from thermonuclear detonations. They will insist that our defense continue to rest on deterrence by threat of nuclear retaliation. Future historians will struggle to explain to their incredulous readers how it could be that a President with a whim of iron could have launched this nation on so extravagant a chase after so wispy a mirage.",1986-05-14T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,editorial-desk-opinion

Its radioactivity has already been detected in Sweden, 700 miles away, and may threaten other countries. Poland has banned the sale of milk from grass-fed cows. Danes urgently seek iodine pills. For the Russians to have stayed silent about the disaster for three days does not invite their neighbors' trust. To dispel the cloud of fear that has spread beyond its borders, the Soviet Union needs to share promptly all that it knows. The disaster may be over, or may hold worse in store. The tiny amounts of radiation measured in Sweden imply that much higher doses, maybe lethal quantities, were released around the Chernobyl plant. If so, many residents of the area could die imminently or from increased cancer in the future. The West has no cause to be smug about nuclear mishaps. Several features of the Chernobyl disaster may be special to the Soviet Union, however. One is the apparent lack of a containment dome around the civilian reactor assumed to be the source of the accident. Such domes, standard on American commercial reactors, have only recently been incorporated into Soviet reactor design. Other safety features, demanded by the many critics of nuclear power in the West, may also have been absent at Chernobyl. The accident may reveal more about the Soviet Union than the hazards of nuclear power. But another lesson may be that nuclear power needs firm and independent regulation. Though America's nuclear industry complains about its regulatory burden, a nexus of rules and fines is a small price to pay. Perhaps the disaster in the Ukraine will show that American reactors need still better evacuation plans or safety techniques. Will Chernobyl turn people against nuclear power? Few countries could afford that luxury. The Soviet Union, though rich in oil and coal, has an ambitious nuclear program that supplies 10 percent of its electricity. America depends on nuclear power for 15 percent of its electrical energy, Japan for 25 percent, France for 65 percent. Even if the casualty toll from Chernobyl should be as heavy as some early reports suggest, the answer is not panic-stricken abandonment of nuclear power but still more safety and shrewder regulation. The Soviet request for outside help in fighting reactor fires and in radiation medicine may suggest a thinness of technology, as well as lack of preparedness. With concentration, the Soviet Union can master prestigious technologies, like missile rocketry. But the grip is not always as secure as the facade presented to the outside world. Behind the Chernobyl setback may lie deeper faults of a weak technology and industrial base. Americans, as vulnerable as Russians to technological disasters and human error, hope the nightmare can soon be contained. The Soviet Union, abandoning its usual policy of stiff autarky, has asked for help. In all decency, the West should hasten to give it. With the same decency, the Russians should hasten to lift the information cloud that still hangs over Chernobyl.",1986-04-30T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,editorial-desk-opinion

The bills were introduced in the Legislature last year, but the Republican-controlled State Senate did not consider them. ''Nuclear power, once touted as being too cheap to meter, today threatens a financial burden that would have serious economic impact on residential, business and government ratepayers,'' the Governor said this week. Mr. Cuomo's legislative package would require a gradual phase-in of rate increases granted to pay for nuclear plants, would impose a ceiling on construction costs that ratepayers must absorb and would prevent utilities from recovering costs for plants that are never used. The Democratic Governor cited two nuclear power projects under way in the state - the Nine Mile 2 plant near Oswego and the Shoreham plant on Long Island - as examples of the need for legislation. The Shoreham plant could cause ''rate shock'' if the Long Island Lighting Company charges its customers for the estimated $4.1 billion cost of the plant over a short period, Mr. Cuomo said. Nine Mile 2, which is 83 percent completed, has become one of the country's most expensive nuclear power plants and already has had a $5.4 billion construction cost ceiling imposed by the State Public Service Commission. The plant, being built by a five-utility consortium with the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation as the principal owner, is more than 12 times over budget and nearly a decade behind its initial projected completion date. Under the Governor's plan, a single utility would have to raise its rates over 10 years to pay for a nuclear plant. Two utilities building one plant would have five years to raise their rates. The ceiling on costs eligible to be recovered from ratepayers would be 111 percent of the target construction cost set by the P.S.C., Mr. Cuomo said. For Nine Mile 2, with a target construction cost of $4.6 billion, the Cuomo bill would establish a $5.1 billion ceiling for recoverable costs. The final proposal would clarify state law so that utilities could not bill customers for nuclear power plants that were not in operation or for construction work in progress. Currently, the Governor said, there is confusion over whether ratepayers can be billed in those instances.",1985-03-10T07:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,metropolitan-desk-new-york

The serious problems at the nuclear power plant in Japan have raised new doubts about the safety of nuclear energy. New exploration has yet to resume in the Gulf of Mexico after last year’s blowout of a BP oil well. And coal plants have been under a shadow because of their contribution to global warming. Meanwhile, natural gas has overcome two of its biggest hurdles — volatile prices and questionable supplies. In large part because of new discoveries in the United States and abroad that have significantly increased known reserves, natural gas prices have been relatively low in the last two years. It is far too early to say for sure whether the calamitous events in Japan may roll back the global nuclear revival and lead to a surge in natural gas demand. It is also too early to say whether officials in charge of nuclear policy are just paying lip service to the public’s safety concerns in the wake of the unfolding disaster. Still, with the global demand for energy expected to grow by double digits in coming decades, analysts are anticipating a new boom in gas consumption. Given the growing concerns about nuclear power and the constraints on carbon emissions, one bank, Société Générale, called natural gas the fuel of “no choice.” “At the end of the day, when you look at the risk-reward equation, natural gas comes out as a winner,” said Lawrence J. Goldstein, an economist at the Energy Policy Research Foundation. “It’s a technical knockout.” Financial markets have already started to price in this new interest in gas. Since the disaster in Japan, uranium prices have dropped by 30 percent, while natural gas prices in Europe and the United States have risen by about 10 percent. Officials from several countries, including China, Germany, Finland and South Africa, said they would review their nuclear strategies. Utilities are also reconsidering natural gas as a potential source of stable power, a function historically filled by coal and nuclear energy. Utility chiefs have been wary of price fluctuations of natural gas, particularly in the last two decades. But that may be about to change, according to John Rowe, chairman of Exelon, the biggest nuclear utility in the United States. He argued that building a nuclear power plant would be prohibitively expensive, while new rules limiting carbon emissions by the Environmental Protection Agency would require costly investments to scrub emissions from coal-powered plants. This means that utilities will increasingly switch to natural gas. “Natural gas is queen,” Mr. Rowe told a panel at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington this month. That view was endorsed by a report to be released on Tuesday by the Bipartisan Policy Center and the American Clean Skies Foundation , which predicts that natural gas consumption will increase because of an abundance of new supplies, some of them in the United States, that are likely to keep prices relatively low. Global natural gas production rose by 44 percent in the two decades from 1990 and 2010, while gas reserves grew by 67 percent. After peaking at $13.58 per thousand cubic feet in 2008, gas prices in the United States averaged $4.38 last year. What is more, natural gas emits about half as much carbon dioxide as coal when it is burned to produce one kilowatt hour of electricity. The immediate market for natural gas will likely be Japan, which is looking to raise its fuel imports after a fifth of its nuclear power capacity was shut down, including the troubled Fukushima Daiichi plant. And Tokyo Electric Power says that the rolling blackouts in the country will continue at least into next winter. Japan already imports a third of global liquefied natural gas shipments and its import terminals, mostly in the south, were not damaged by the earthquake. Nuclear power and coal each accounts for a quarter of Japan’s power generation, while natural gas accounts for 30 percent, according to analysts with the Raymond James financial company. “It could be that the Honshu earthquake is the catalyst which fundamentally reshapes our approach to global energy,” Bernstein Research analysts wrote last week. Many oil companies have anticipated this shift. At Royal Dutch Shell, natural gas production overtook its oil output in recent years. Exxon Mobil bought XTO Energy last year to raise its presence in the growing domestic shale gas market. It has also developed significant resources in Qatar, which holds the third-largest reserves of natural gas in the world, after Russia and Iran. Huge new projects dedicated to liquefied natural gas — in which gas is frozen, compressed in liquid form for easier shipment, then returned to a gas state at import terminals — have been mushrooming around the world. In Papua-New Guinea, Exxon is leading a $15 billion project to build and develop an LNG plant to supply Asian customers. Chevron recently began engineering work on the $40 billion Gorgon gas project in Australia, along with Shell and Exxon. Russia, for its part, is planning to develop huge new fields in the Arctic. Natural gas is not without problems. To unlock methane from hard shale rocks in the United States, energy companies use hydraulic fracturing, a method that has been criticized on the grounds of polluting water sources, including rivers and underground aquifers. But energy policy must balance out these hazards with the concerns about nuclear power, as well as the still unresolved problem of what to do with spent nuclear fuel that remains radioactive for hundreds of years. “Nuclear power has suddenly found itself going from being (arguably) part of the solution for future green energy to a now dangerous relic of the cold war era,” Deutsche Bank said in a report last week. In the United States, where no new reactor has been built since the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, the attitude toward nuclear power has been ambivalent. Last year, the president asked the Energy Department to provide some financial backing for nuclear operations, including two reactors planned for Georgia. But in the aftermath of the Japanese disaster, the administration ordered a comprehensive review of safety at nuclear plants. At the same time, the industry has found it nearly impossible to develop and finance new plants. In December, for example, Exelon dropped its application to build a plant in Victoria County, Tex., in the face of opposition. Utilities have also faced a challenge in renewing their existing operating licenses. The Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station, in Plymouth, Mass., has been waiting for a new license for five years because of litigation and court delays. State officials in Vermont have been battling to shut down Entergy’s Vermont Yankee plant, which began operations in 1972. There are 104 nuclear reactors in the United States, which contribute 23 percent of the nation’s electrical power. Twenty reactors have applications pending with federal regulators to extend the plants’ operating lives by as much as two decades, according to Bloomberg News. “We are likely to do to nuclear licensing what we did to offshore permitting,” Mr. Goldstein, of the energy policy foundation, said. “We will delay and stall.”",2011-03-22T01:36:35.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-global-business

But as the vote on Sunday approaches, polls and political analysts say the two aging leaders have not yet been able to persuade enough voters to back their quixotic bid against nuclear power. Analysts say the message of the election results for Tokyo governor is likely to be muddled in any case, with the antinuclear vote split and the pro-nuclear governing party’s candidate trying to blunt his rivals’ message by saying he supports an “eventual phaseout” of nuclear power. Both of the former leaders are major figures from Japan’s political past. Morihiro Hosokawa, 76, who was Japan’s first opposition prime minister 20 years ago, is running for governor. The other, Junichiro Koizumi, 72, has tried to bring his star power to bear by campaigning vigorously for Mr. Hosokawa. Their effort is aimed not at their local opponents, but squarely at Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has vowed to turn nuclear plants back on to secure low-cost electricity as part of his plan to revive economic growth. At a campaign stop, Mr. Hosokawa, who was helped by aides up a ladder to a platform atop a truck, made a forceful appeal about how a vote for him could stymie Mr. Abe’s plans. “This is not only Tokyo’s election!” bellowed Mr. Hosokawa, who had stunned Japan by announcing he would come out of nearly two decades of retirement as a potter to run as an antinuclear candidate. “If Tokyo says no to nuclear power, it can change the future of Japan! The whole world is watching! It wants to know, can Japan change?” The antinuclear campaign is remarkable not only for drawing two of Japan’s best-known reformist leaders out of retirement, but also for highlighting their very public apostasy: Both were former believers in nuclear power who say they turned against it after the Fukushima disaster exposed its dangers. Both were also from rival parties. The two men have run a single-issue campaign in which they promise to declare that Tokyo, the capital, will never again use nuclear-generated electricity, and instead get as much power as possible from renewable sources like solar. Because of public concerns about safety, Japan’s 48 operable commercial reactors were idled in the months after the triple meltdown in March 2011 that was caused by an earthquake and tsunami. But Mr. Abe and other nuclear supporters say Japan cannot recover from its long economic slump without cheap power. When Mr. Koizumi and Mr. Hosokawa began their campaign late last month, they pitched it as what many analysts agreed was the first real chance to put the nuclear question directly to a large number of voters. The governing Liberal Democratic Party’s victories in two national elections after the accident are widely seen as having been votes of dissatisfaction with a previous opposition-party government, not a conclusive show of support for Mr. Abe’s nuclear policies. But analysts say the two former prime ministers appear to be having trouble persuading enough voters to take their attempt seriously. Polls this week showed the governing party candidate, Yoichi Masuzoe, 65, a former labor minister who is backed by the governing party’s powerful vote-gathering machine, ahead with just a few days to go, though many voters still appear undecided. Mr. Hosokawa also appears to have lost voters to another antinuclear candidate, backed by the Communist Party. “Koizumi and Hosokawa just look too old and too removed from local concerns in Tokyo,” said Hiroshi Shiratori, a political scientist at Hosei University in Tokyo. “This has not become the referendum on nuclear power that they had hoped for.” Mr. Abe has largely stayed aloof, intervening only to question whether a local election is an appropriate forum for deciding national energy policy. Mr. Masuzoe has also tried to focus the election on other issues like preparing for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Mr. Hosokawa and Mr. Koizumi counter that the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant is relevant to Tokyo voters because the plant existed to supply their city with electricity. Still, the two former leaders draw huge crowds when they speak. In a recent speech in front of a Tokyo train station, Mr. Koizumi, who battled vested interests as prime minister from 2001 to 2006, said that turning away from nuclear power would give the nation a chance to reinvent itself, just as it did when it rose from defeat after World War II. He laid out a vision in which Japan would become a global pioneer in renewable energy. “It won’t be easy, but we can rise to this new challenge if we try!” boomed Mr. Koizumi, whose trademark wavy hair has whitened with age. “Japanese are good at beating the odds!” Many of those listening said they were moved by Mr. Koizumi’s appeals, but were also worried that eliminating nuclear power would hurt the economy’s chances for recovery. “It is an agonizing choice,” said Hiromi Onuki, 77, a retired manufacturing company manager who strained to see Mr. Koizumi over the heads of the crowd. “We saw what happened in Fukushima, and Japan cannot survive another such accident. But does Japan really have any other realistic choice for affordable energy?”",2014-02-08T04:14:48.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

He was 95. Mr. Starr was still coming to work six days a week until the day before his death, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit utility consortium in Palo Alto, Calif., which he founded in 1972. Both Dr. Starr's advocacy and his design work were important in the early years of nuclear power. ''Chauncey Starr was a visionary pioneer in the field of nuclear energy and helped encourage the development of the domestic nuclear power industry,'' Dale Klein, the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said on Wednesday. ''Likewise, he was a leader in reactor safety, a seminal thinker in the field of risk analysis, and one of the pre-eminent engineer-scientists of our time.'' Mr. Starr was the dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles, from 1966 to 1973; there, he directed early work on risk analysis and social benefits. He was a very early exponent of the idea that society's perception of risk was skewed. At a meeting of the National Academy of Engineering in 1969, commenting on why only 40 percent of car passengers used lap belts and hardly any used shoulder belts (which were then separate pieces of hardware), he said that people would accept risks if they thought the risks were more than balanced by convenience or other benefits. Thus, he said, people would accept ''voluntary'' risks, from smoking or sports, that were 1,000 times as great as the risk they would allow to be imposed on them from the generation of electricity. ''As one would expect, we are loath to let others do unto us what we happily do to ourselves,'' he said. Earning an electrical engineering degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1932 and a Ph.D. in physics three years later, Dr. Starr became a research fellow at Harvard University and then worked on the Manhattan Project, the World War II effort to develop atomic weapons. By 1953, as the president of the atomic research division of North American Aviation, he presented a model of an eight-megawatt nuclear power reactor that he said could be built for $10 million. It used liquid metal to transfer the heat produced in the reactor for production of steam and electricity. It was not the design ultimately chosen by the American industry. Three years later, observing that generating capacity was doubling every 10 years in this country, he predicted that nuclear power might eventually dominate the energy field. ''In about 50 years, it might be conceivably most desirable if the major portions of our electricity and heat for cities was supplied by central station nuclear power plants,'' he said. ''This would preserve our fossil fuel resources for mobile power (automobiles, trains, small ships and airplanes) and raw material for the chemical industry.'' In fact, reactors today provide 20 percent of the nation's electricity, and 10 percent of its energy over all. Dr. Starr was also an advocate of electrification. In the 1980s and 1990s, he would argue at energy conferences that electrification had planetwide potential. Cooking dinner over an open fire, as in the third world, wastes 98 percent of the energy used. If the same wood were burned in a boiler to make electricity, he said, it might cook 15 dinners. Dr. Starr wrote more than 400 technical and scientific articles. He had also served as vice president of the National Academy of Engineering and was a founder and past president of the American Nuclear Society. He is survived by his wife of 69 years, Doris; a daughter, Ariel Wooley of Los Altos, Calif.; a son, Ross, of San Diego; and five grandchildren. A celebration to honor Mr. Starr, who turned 95 on Saturday, was held at the Electric Power Research Institute the day before he died; 200 colleagues attended.

Friedman regarding the need to convert to a more sustainable energy policy (April 15). But I cannot believe that he uncritically accepts the inclusion of increased nuclear power as a part of the solution. Nuclear power is anything but ''clean.'' Sure, the actual nuclear process produces no carbon dioxide, but the mining and transport process is itself CO2 intensive. And we still have no long-term solution to the problem of nuclear waste. Part of the impetus for going green is the fact that we are financing terrorist movements with our energy dollars. But how does it help to build new targets for terrorists to hit? Who needs a dirty bomb when a clean one hitting a nuclear facility can do the same damage? Why play into the hands of terrorists by expanding the amount of nuclear material going around the globe, ready to be stolen and converted to threatening purposes? Increased efficiency and research into true renewable energy sources are the answer -- not the dangerous, polluting (even if slightly more carbon-friendly) nuclear option.

Russian forces seized control of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe’s largest, in March. They have since effectively turned it into a fortress and a launchpad for attacks on Ukrainian positions. In recent weeks, shells have hit the facility and the area around it — with Ukraine and Russia trading blame over who is responsible and the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog expressing alarm over the potential for a major nuclear accident. On Monday, the Ukrainian company that oversees the nation’s nuclear power plants said that Russian forces had in the past week targeted a fire station outside of the plant that is responsible for extinguishing fires at the facility in the event of an emergency.

President Reagan's decision Friday to weigh in to the battles over the Seabrook and Shoreham nuclear power plants was a thunderbolt to nearly everyone but the Department of Energy and advocates of nuclear power, who have been mulling over just such a step for nearly four years. To them, Mr. Reagan's order allowing the Federal Government to override local opposition to nuclear power stations was more than a last-gasp effort to revive the moribund plant at Shoreham on Long Island and Seabrook in New Hampshire. Some, in fact, say there is still hope that the order will enable the two plants to begin producing electricity. Whether or not that proves true, the officials view the order as the opening salvo in a battle to return the nuclear power industry to the robust health that it has not enjoyed since 1979, when the Three Mile Island disaster halted, almost in its tracks, most planning of new nuclear power-generating stations. An Arsenal of Arguments And after a decade spent almost as pariahs, the advocates of nuclear power say they now have an arsenal of powerful arguments on their side - including environmental concerns, financial and legal issues and political power - not only to operate Shoreham and Seabrook but also to build dozens of new plants. Frank M. Cushing, the Republican staff director of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said in an interview today: ''Political times change. Constituencies change. Party control in given areas of the country change. People see this as consistent not just from a states' rights standpoint, but from the standpoint of electric power production and energy policy, too. ''Here we have two huge plants ready to operate, and we're looking at power outages in the Northeast, and everyone agrees on one thing: it's silly not to operate them.'' Of course, not everyone agrees; the Governor of New York, the incoming Governor of New Hampshire and both states' Congressional delegations are more or less solidly opposed to efforts to secure Federal operating licenses for Seabrook and Shoreham. Evacuation Plans at the Core Local opposition in those states and in Massachusetts has delayed efforts by the plants' operators, the Public Service Company of New Hampshire and the Long Island Lighting Company, to develop emergency evacuation plans for communities near the plants. The plans are required before the licenses can be granted. The Presidential order issued Friday sidesteps local roadblocks by allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to devise and carry out emergency plans for nuclear power stations. Most experts say the order is too late to help Seabrook or Shoreham. Both are in dire financial straits and, in any case, are already seeking Federal approval for alternative emergency plans. But Administration officials, while acknowledging that they are playing a long shot, clearly believe both plants can be rescued. ''My impression is that if those plants were granted a license, they could operate,'' Theodore J. Garrish, the Assistant Secretary of Energy for nuclear energy, said in an interview Saturday. ''I don't think we would be in this process if it were impossible for either plant to operate.'' What Led to Reagan's Action The action the President took on Friday has been discussed for more than a year, but it was rattling in the Energy Department bureaucracy long before that. In February 1985, a department official, writing about the Shoreham deadlock, noted that the Civil Defense Act of 1950 allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency to respond to technological disasters. The official suggested that the Energy Department could act for the management agency in nuclear emergencies. That law is the basis of Friday's order. Administration officials offered no clear explanation of why the Energy Department delayed action on the 1985 proposal. When it came under active scrutiny last year, they say, protests by New York and New Hampshire officials slowed its progress, and so did recalcitrant officials of the emergency management agency who were said to be wary of taking on such sweeping duties. The White House Domestic Policy Council finally approved the order this summer, Administration officials said, but it was considered too volatile to be issued before the election, and so it was withheld until last week. Administration and Congressional officials say they regret the delays. ''This should have been done four or five years ago,'' Mr. Garrish said Saturday. Obstacles for Shoreham But they say the battle for Shoreham and Seabrook is far from over. Although Lilco is seeking to sell the Shoreham plant to the State of New York, Congressional officials say the agreement could unravel in the State Legislature, whose approval is needed. Even if the plant is sold, a secondary issue - the $2.5 billion in Federal tax deductions that Lilco would gain as a result of its money-losing sale of the power station - will pose severe political problems in Congress, which could consider barring the tax benefits altogether. If either the sale of the plant or the tax write-offs fell through, they say, Lilco could be forced to operate the Shoreham plant as a commercial venture. Even if Shoreham and Seabrook are dismantled, the President's executive order could reduce licensing delays for a number of plants that are now under construction in Pennsylvania, Georgia and Texas. Energy Department and other officials say it will prove important to new plants that they expect to be built if opposition to nuclear power begins to wane, as they predict.",1988-11-21T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

Andrew M. Cuomo plans to order state regulators to mandate that, by 2030, half of all power consumed by New Yorkers be generated from renewable sources that emit much less carbon dioxide, people briefed on the matter said. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has already declared a goal of having 50 percent of the state’s power come from solar, wind, hydroelectric or other renewable sources in 15 years, but the state has had no means of enforcing that directive. The governor intends to have the Public Service Commission , which regulates utilities in the state, codify the requirement, these people said. Some of them, including a Cuomo administration official, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not have permission to discuss the proposed mandate. The mandate would be another step toward the governor’s goal of a 40 percent reduction in carbon emissions from plants supplying the state’s electricity. In the intervening years, the energy policy would give utilities an incentive to use power generated by nuclear plants, which are considered clean sources, though not renewable. By pushing utilities to obtain more of the power they distribute from less-polluting sources, state officials hope to delay the planned shutdown of two nuclear power plants on the shore of Lake Ontario. Aides to the governor have been trying for several weeks to dissuade Entergy from closing one of them, the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant in Oswego County. Entergy officials say they will close the plant in late 2016 or early 2017 because it has been losing about $60 million a year. Nuclear plants emit less air pollution than power plants fueled by natural gas or coal, so the loss of them would set back the state’s hopes of meeting its clean-energy goals. Even if the mandate comes too late to keep the reactor at the FitzPatrick plant operating, state officials hope it could prolong the life of the Robert E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant near Rochester. The Ginna plant’s owners said in 2014 that they intended to shut it down, but state officials struck a deal to subsidize its operation to keep it running until 2017. Cuomo administration officials want the upstate nuclear power plants to continue operating until 2030, when they hope that there will be enough sources of renewable energy to supply half of the state’s needs, according to people who have been briefed on the matter. But Mr. Cuomo has taken an opposite stance on Entergy’s Indian Point nuclear plant in Westchester County, which has two reactors. The governor has repeatedly called for Indian Point to be shut down, saying it is too dangerous to have a nuclear plant so close to a metropolis. It is perched on the edge of the Hudson River in Buchanan, about 30 miles north of Manhattan. “It’s certainly a quandary,” one of the people briefed on the matter, Gavin J. Donohue, the president of the Independent Power Producers of New York, said of Mr. Cuomo’s positions on the upstate and downstate nuclear plants. “It’s clear that the governor is recognizing the value of upstate nuclear energy . That’s a big change for the State of New York, and it’s welcome news.” Mr. Donohue said he thought owners of power plants in the state would welcome Mr. Cuomo’s mandate if it did not interfere too much with the market for power. “What we’re trying to get to is a market-based approach to solving climate-change issues,” he said. “We need to not have the government pick winners and losers.” Mr. Cuomo, who has positioned himself as a leader in the battle against climate change , announced an energy plan in June that drew praise from former Vice President Al Gore . Mr. Gore, a Democrat who has made drawing attention to global warming his signature cause, called the governor’s proposed mandate “a terrific and bold action,” noting that it comes a week before the United Nations will hold a conference on climate change in Paris. “Governor Cuomo’s commitment to expanding renewable energy and transforming the energy landscape in New York State reflects his longstanding leadership in the effort to solve the climate crisis,” Mr. Gore said in a statement. “And the timing couldn’t be better. As we approach the global climate negotiations in Paris in just over a week, actions by state governments like New York State provide essential momentum toward a strong and effective agreement.” Rory M. Christian, the director of clean energy for the Environmental Defense Fund in New York, said that Mr. Cuomo’s proposed mandate was similar to one that California’s Legislature passed and Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed into law last month. “Yeah, it’s an achievable goal,” Mr. Christian said. “We got a man to the moon; we can get to 50 percent renewable energy.” What effect the mandate will have on consumers’ electric bills is “a concern,” Mr. Christian said. “Rates are always going to be a concern,” he said. But, he added, “the key thing is more renewables will keep those costs from going up or stabilize them.” Renewable sources of energy like solar and wind power operate intermittently and not as reliably as plants fueled by gas, coal or nuclear. And encouraging the development of those sources may involve subsidies from ratepayers, the Cuomo administration official said. On the other hand, the state official said, “This will actually avoid the sticker shock that ratepayers experience every time there is a fuel shortage, a power plant goes offline or there is a spike in energy costs.”",2015-11-23T03:00:15.000+01:00,NYTIMES,metro-new-york
25225de3-791d-508b-8ad6-7724611e8aa2,https://www.tipsproject.eu/tips/,Japan Quake Raises Nuclear Fears,"TOKYO, July 17 — Japanese authorities today suspended the operation of a nuclear power plant after a radiation leak and other damage from a deadly earthquake on the nation’s northwestern coast raised new concerns about the safety of Japan’s accident-plagued nuclear industry. Tokyo Electric Power, an electric company that operates the nuclear plant near the city of Kashiwazaki, said it had found more than 50 problems at the plant caused by Monday’s earthquake. While most of the problems were minor, the largest included 100 drums of radioactive waste that had fallen over, causing the lids on some of the drums to open, the company said. On Monday, the company said that the earthquake also caused a small fire at the plant, the world’s largest by amount of electricity produced, and the leakage of 317 gallons of water containing trace levels of radioactive materials into the nearby Sea of Japan. The company announced today that it had detected tiny amounts of radioactive material in an air filter in one of the plant’s seven reactors, though the company said it was unlikely that the material had entered the atmosphere outside the reactor. The company said it was still examining how the tainted water had leaked out, but it said the level of radioactivity was too low to endanger humans or the environment. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe criticized Tokyo Electric for being “too slow” in reporting the problems to the government and the public. “Nuclear power can only operate with the people’s trust,” Mr. Abe told reporters. Power companies “must accurately and swiftly report what is happening,” he said. Television footage showed rescuers digging through buildings in Kashiwazaki that were toppled by the earthquake, which local police said killed at least nine people and injured another 1,000. Japan’s meteorological agency said the earthquake had a magnitude of 6.8; the United States Geological Survey put the magnitude at 6.6. Japan’s military used warships and trucks to carry rice balls, bread, and water to the remote region in Niigata prefecture, about 160 miles northwest of Tokyo, where the earthquake struck on Monday morning. But relief efforts were slowed by landslides and gaping cracks in the earth that severed rail lines and roads, local media reports said. About 13,000 residents fled their homes, the media reported. Television pictures showed many people sleeping on blankets and futons in school gymnasiums that had been turned into makeshift shelters. In Tokyo, government ministers scrambled to reassure the public about the safety of the nation’s nuclear power plants, which have suffered a string of accidents and cover-ups in recent years. The economic ministry, which regulates the power industry, moved swiftly to reprimand Tokyo Electric for failing to report the leak into the Sea of Japan to authorities for some six hours. The ministry also ordered suspension of the plant’s operations until safety could be ensured, and dispatched a team of inspectors to survey the damage. Nuclear safety can be a particularly sensitive issue in Japan, the only nation to be attacked with atomic weapons when the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed in 1945. Nuclear safety experts said the authorities apparently feared the accidents related to this week’s earthquake could raise fresh public doubts about Japan’s 55 nuclear reactors, which the resource-poor nation relies on for about a third of its electricity and to lessen its dependence on energy from the Middle East. “This will stir new debate about whether nuclear plants are safe enough,” said Haruki Madarame, a professor in nuclear safety engineering at Tokyo University. “Authorities will have to show the public that they are taking all reasonable steps to ensure safety.” Japan is also one of the most earthquake-prone nations in the world, and it has strict regulations that are meant to prevent earthquake damage to its nuclear plants. These regulations include building nuclear plants on solid bedrock to limit shaking from earthquakes, and erecting anti-tsunami walls at plants along the coast, like the Kashiwazaki plant. Tokyo Electric said the damage from the earthquake did not threaten the safety of the reactors at the Kashiwazaki plant. Four reactors were operating at the time, and all shut down safely, the company said. However, it said that the force of the shaking caused by the earthquake had exceeded the design limits of the reactors, suggesting that the plant’s builders had underestimated the strength of possible earthquakes in the region. The chief government spokesman, Yasuhisa Shiozaki, said the designs of other nuclear plants may have to be reexamined after Monday’s earthquake to make sure they are strong enough to resist all potential earthquakes. Nuclear safety experts said Monday’s earthquake struck as power companies were examining reactors to see if they met new safety standards set last September. The experts said the unexpected strength of the earthquake’s tremors may force authorities to set even tougher standards, and carry out fresh seismic studies to determine if they were underestimating the size of potential earthquakes. The suspension of operations at the Kashiwazaki plant, which can produce up to 7,219 megawatts, comes as Tokyo faces the summer months of peak power use. In March, another nuclear plant operator, Hokuriku Electric Power, shut down a reactor after admitting it had covered up a 15-minute uncontrollable nuclear chain reaction in 1999. Three years ago, Japan’s deadliest nuclear accident killed four workers at a nuclear plant when a steam pipe burst.",2007-07-17T06:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

They also agreed to set up a commission to examine building another one, and Russia said that for the next 10 years it would provide fuel for the reactor at Bushire in southern Iran. The agreement was signed by Gholamreza Aghazadeh, head of Iran's atomic organization, and Russia's atomic energy minister, Aleksandr Rumyantsev, who came to Tehran on Sunday for a four-day visit. Washington has urged Russia to refrain from doing business with Iran in the nuclear field because it fears Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons. Last week American officials said they were concerned about newly disclosed plans for two other nuclear plants, at Arak and Natanz in central Iran, which showed up in recent satellite photos. Iran has large oil and gas reserves and Washington believes it has no need to develop nuclear energy. Mr. Rumayanstev brushed off American pressure today and said that the cooperation between Iran and Russia was based on international regulations and the resolutions of the International Atomic Energy Agency, according to the news agency. Mr. Aghazadeh added that Iran had nothing to hide and has asked the the atomic agency to inspect its nuclear activity. He urged the United States to rely on the agency's reports, saying that otherwise Washington's assertions were mere propaganda. The director general of the agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, is expected to visit Iran in February. In a separate news conference today, the cabinet spokesman, Abdullah Ramezanzadeh, said Iran was determined to continue its program to develop nuclear power and benefit from foreign technology. ''We consider it our legal right to make peaceful use of nuclear energy,'' he said. He added that existing power plants were not sufficient to meet the growing domestic need for electricity. Iran has argued that it needs to generate an additional 6,000 megawatts of electricity and that the nuclear plants are intended to produce the power. West Germans began building two reactors in Bushire before the 1979 revolution. The projects were interrupted by the revolution and the eight-year war with Iraq, which ended in 1988. Iran signed an agreement with Russia to complete one of the reactors. Russia was to complete the work on the project by 2005. But Mr. Aghazadeh said today that it would produce 1,000 megawatts of electricity by the end of next year. He also said that the countries ''hope to start a joint study in the next few months'' on the possiblity of building a second reactor. President Mohammad Khatami said on Tuesday during a visit to Pakistan that Iran was committed to its obligations and had no intention to develop nuclear weapons. He added that the nuclear waste from Bushire plant would be taken to Russia for safekeeping. He said that Iran's willingness to send spent fuel back to Russia showed that it did not want to use it for weapons.",2002-12-26T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,washington

Chubb of the Brooking Institution, which advocated the opening of the Seabrook and Shoreham nuclear plants over the objections of officials in New Hampshire and New York, the states where they are situated, omitted some important facts and misrepresented others. In attempting to frame the issue in national energy security terms, Mr. Chubb claimed that nuclear plants are essential to reducing United States dependence on Middle Eastern oil. This is untrue. Only 5 percent of all oil consumed in the United States is burned in power plants. Only a fraction of this comes from the Middle East. The vast majority of Middle Eastern oil is burned in cars. While it's true that New England is the most oil-dependent region in the country, nuclear power will not make the region more secure. Judging by the record of downtime and mismanagement of the region's other nuclear units, nuclear power is not a dependable electricity source. Contrary to Mr. Chubb's assertion, the evacuation issue has been raised from the earliest stages of plant siting. Not only Massachusetts, but also New Hampshire, opposed construction of the Seabrook plant on the precise ground that is still identical today - the impossibility of evacuating the beaches adjacent to the plant. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, at the urging of the owners of the plants, refused to consider this issue until after construction was complete. There is a national interest in energy policy, but Seabrook and Shoreham are not part of it. They will displace little or no Middle Eastern oil while subjecting hundreds of thousands of people to the risk of being trapped during a nuclear accident. Our national energy policy, as expressed by Congress, is that nuclear-power plants shall only be operated if the population around them can be protected in a serious accident. More than $9 billion has been spent on these two plants, but that has not made living near them any safer.

I’m staring over the edge of a cliff into a seam of coal some 80 feet thick running along a chasm cut deep into the earth. A gargantuan claw rips a massive bite from the slab and swings it into the bed of a preposterously large dump truck. Scott Durgin, who manages the mine for Peabody Energy, tries hard to communicate its enormous scale. In a typical day, Mr. Durgin tells me, 21 trains depart the mine, pulling 135 cars each. Each car bears 120 tons of coal. At this pace, he says, there is more than 20 years’ worth of coal ready to mine under my feet. North Antelope Rochelle is among the biggest coal mines in the world. It produced 108 million tons last year — about 10 percent of all the coal burned by the nation’s power plants. Standing at the precipice, staring into the thick black mineral vein, I find it difficult to envisage how an enterprise of this magnitude could be stopped, and what could take its place. North Antelope Rochelle is only 30 years old. It wasn’t around during the first oil shock of 1973 or during the Iranian revolution of 1979, which led to a second oil shock. It hadn’t opened for business when a nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania melted down, when 200,000 people gathered in New York City’s Battery Park to hear Ralph Nader demand the end of atomic power and Carly Simon sing yearningly about the “ comforting glow of a wood fire .” Those events set the nation on a hurried quest for alternative sources of energy. Coal was the big winner. In April 1977, President Jimmy Carter call  ed Americans to arms , urging a vast increase in coal production to “protect ourselves from uncertain supplies” of oil. North Antelope Rochelle and the other vast strip mines cutting through the plains of Wyoming’s Powder River Basin — whose low-sulfur carbon met standards imposed by the Clean Air Act — were the result. Since then, coal production west of the Mississippi has multiplied by four times, to about 640 million tons a year. While nuclear power also ranked high in President Carter’s speech, it proved no match against cheap coal and gas — especially after the force of American public opinion, scarred by visions of Three Mile Island and Ukraine’s Chernobyl disaster, contributed to delays and regulatory hurdles that made building a new nuclear power plant prohibitively more expensive. Today, the world is staring at a similar inflection point in energy policy. Glowing wood fires are now understood to be a problem, spewing heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Most scientists see coal — what James Schlesinger, the nation’s first energy secretary, called America’s “black hope” — as one of the biggest threats to the world’s climate. But even as the consensus among experts builds that coal and other fossil fuels must be sharply reduced and eventually removed from the energy matrix, there is no agreement on what sources of energy could feasibly take their place, and how to get from here to there. As in the 1970s, environmental activists remain enthralled by the sun and the wind. But three decades’ worth of renewable energy dreams have yielded too little to entrust them with the job of replacing fossil fuels. Today renewable energy supplies only about 6 percent of American demand. And most of that comes from water flowing through dams. Solar energy contributes next to nothing. Averting climate change is likely to require much less eco-friendly sources of power. This includes natural gas, of course, which emits about half the carbon dioxide of coal. But over the long term it is likely to require much more investment in a big bugaboo of the environmental movement: nuclear power. The arithmetic is merciless. To make it likely that the world’s temperature will rise no more than 2 degrees Celsius above the average of the preindustrial era — a target agreed to by the world’s governments in 2010 — humanity must spew no more than 900 billion more tons of carbon dioxide into the air from now through 2050 and only 75 billion tons after that, according to an authoritative new study in Britain . The question is how to square that both with the energy that we need and the energy that we have. The United States Energy Information Administration forecasts that global energy consumption will grow 56 percent between now and 2040. Almost 80 percent of that energy demand will be satisfied by fossil fuels. Under this assumption, carbon emissions would rise to 45 billion tons a year in 2040, from 32 billion in 2011, and the world would blow past its carbon ceiling in fewer than 25 years. “We have trillions of tons of coal resources in the world,” Vic Svec, spokesman for Peabody Energy, told me. “You can expect the world to use them all.” The only way around this is to put something in coal’s place, at a reasonably competitive price. Neither the warm glow of the sun nor the restless power of the wind is going to do the trick, at least not soon enough to make a difference in the battle to prevent climate change. An analysis of power generation in 21 countries by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the International Energy Agency projected that even if the world were to impose a tax of $30 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, neither wind nor solar could outcompete gas and coal. A new generation of nuclear power, by contrast, is potentially the cheapest energy source of all. The study projected that the typical nuclear generator in North America could produce power at $50 to $75 per megawatt-hour, depending on assumptions about construction costs and interest rates, against $70 to $80 for coal-fueled power. Wind-powered electricity would cost from $60 to $90, but there are limits to how much it can be scaled up. A megawatt-hour of solar power still costs in the hundreds. The study concluded that nuclear power would prove even more competitive in Asia and Europe. It is easy to despair about the climate’s prospects. Sure, President Obama’s new energy policy calls for tight limits on coal-fired power plants. But nuclear power barely merited a mention in his speech at Georgetown University. The odds that Congress will pass a tax on carbon emissions seem as low as ever. Without one, any alternative energy source will have a hard time competing against fossil fuels. Public opinion around the world has become vehemently against nuclear energy after the tsunami damage to the power reactor in Fukushima, Japan, in 2011. Germany, one of the most committed nations in the combat against climate change, has turned its back on nuclear power and, intentionally or not, increased its dependence on carbon-heavy coal. China, the world’s fastest-growing energy hog, is building reactors at speed, but it is building coal-fired power plants even faster. Robert Stone, a documentary filmmaker who directed “ Pandora’s Promise ,” about the environmental case for nuclear power, argues that atomic energy’s time is coming. Younger environmentalists don’t associate nuclear power with Chernobyl and the cold war. Studies have revealed it to be safer than other fuels . In the movie, Michael Shellenberger, an environmental activist whom Time magazine once named a Hero of the Environment, argues that beliefs that solar and wind power can displace fossil fuels amount to “hallucinatory delusions.” Still, the hurdles are substantial. There are fewer nuclear generators in the United States than in 1987. Just maintaining nuclear energy’s share of 19 percent of the nation’s electricity generation will require adding several dozen new ones. Each will take some 10 years and $5 billion to construct. If nuclear power is to play a leading role combating climate change, it should start now.",2013-08-20T22:31:35.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-economy

All across Eastern and Western Europe, citizens are asking political leaders and scientists hard questions. Is it morally justifiable to continue to use nuclear energy after Chernobyl? Are the risks and dangers that Chernobyl revealed avoidable? Will governments agree to put safety above all other considerations - and can a safety-first policy be enforced? Such questions have been especially acute in the Federal Republic of Germany. Their intensity reflects our close proximity to several major national nuclear power programs in Central Europe. Since Bonn remains convinced that nuclear power will continue to be an important source of energy for social and economic development both at home and abroad, the Government has reaffirmed its longstanding conviction that the greatest possible safety guarantees must be provided. Nuclear power will help bridge the gap beween energy supply and demand until alternative sources of energy are ready. As for practical steps, since Chernobyl, West Germany has taken strong measures to improve the safety of our nuclear power program. Comprehensive safety checks have been ordered at all nuclear plants. A new law has been drafted to make the federal Government responsible for monitoring radioactivity and shielding the public from radiation. Chernobyl's most important -ethical - lesson is that nations cannot ignore the consequences of nuclear problems beyond their borders and that national interest must yield to a broader concern for the safety and well-being of everyone on this planet. Industrial nations carry a special responsibility. Since the world's population is growing dramatically, particularly in the developing nations, the great challenge of our era is to provide a dignified existence for everyone. Thus, when an industrialized nation weighs the need for continuing and increasing its nuclear energy, its overriding concern should not be the growth rate of its own energy needs but rather the fact that worldwide energy needs are markedly growing as developing nations seek to provide for expanding populations. Critics of nuclear energy say that industrialized nations should return exclusively to fossil fuel for energy. But such action would hardly be fair to developing countries. The reason is that by today's best estimates fossil-fuel reserves are available for only several more generations. It would not be ethical for the economically strong to intensify their use of fossil fuels, thus hastening their depletion and depriving third world nations of a readily available energy source crucial to their hopes for development. Nor is it ethical for industrialized nations to intensify the use of fossil fuels when such action carries a risk of world ecological catastrophe. Since nuclear power plays a role in meeting development needs, its safety must be guaranteed. And if the fear generated by Chernobyl is to be replaced by public confidence in nuclear energy, proposals West Germany recently put before the international community must gain acceptance. First, public safety must have absolute priority: it must have precedence over any consideration of profit. Second, all safety recommendations by the International Atomic Energy Agency must involve the latest technology and must be compulsory. Third, all nations must submit their nuclear plants to safety review by the Agency. Finally, the principle that the ''polluter pays'' must be applied when compensation for damages is sought. Financial responsibility for trans-border damages must be borne by the country that causes an accident. Chernobyl has made possible the beginnings of international cooperation in providing nuclear safety. If we all control the risks - they are indeed controllable - and if all countries make it clear that they have nothing to hide when it comes to the safety of their plants, nuclear energy can continue to be a safe, important source of energy.",1986-11-07T06:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,editorial-desk-opinion

That is the message that Chinese officials have been giving to visiting environmental experts and local news media. According to a statement posted Tuesday on the Web site of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the vice minister, Li Ganjie, told a visiting delegation from the United States that China had completed an inspection of the country’s 13 nuclear power plants. The statement implied that the plants had passed the test, which was announced in April after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster in Japan. By October, Mr. Li said, the ministry will have tested 28 plants under construction. Until those inspections are completed, he said, China will not approve the plants for operation. The decision to move forward was not a surprise. With China’s energy demand estimated to be rising by 12 percent a year, the country’s leaders have declared nuclear power to be an important part of China’s energy future. The government wants to have 100 plants operational by 2020. “The fundamental issue for China is their demand for power is exceptional,” said James Maguire, a regional managing director of power construction at Aon Risk Solutions in Hong Kong. “Nuclear is an important part of the mix.” Indeed, even during the Japanese crisis, China and other growing countries, like India, declared that they were moving ahead with their nuclear plans. Although China has shown an impressive ability to develop new nuclear technologies , it still faces many challenges that its review may have ignored, said Thomas B. Cochran , a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington. Some Chinese sites are near densely populated areas or the coast, where they may be susceptible to the sort of tsunami that hit the Japanese plant in March. “In China’s case, they’ve got some serious problems to deal with, and they’re probably not going to deal with them,” Mr. Cochran said. Less problematic, he said, is the issue of what to do with the used nuclear fuel. China stores its fuel at the sites of nuclear plants, as do most countries. But unlike Iran, another country with nuclear plants, China already has nuclear weapons, so few analysts are worried that it may reprocess the fuel and create weapons-grade plutonium, he said.",2011-06-16T23:04:29.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Bolstered by advances in its own technology, India is proceeding with an ambitious nuclear energy program requiring the storage of tons of plutonium of potential use for nuclear weapons in installations without international safeguards, according to Indian officials. India's program to produce plutonium, a key ingredient in nuclear weapons, has been under way since the 1960's. But only in the last three years has India been able to make large quantities from domestically built sites so that the plutonium is not subject to outside inspection. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and other Indian officials continue to insist that India has no nuclear weapons program, despite its proven ability in the field. India exploded what it called a ''peaceful'' nuclear device in 1974 after years of secret research. But India also refuses to bring several domestically constructed nuclear installations under international inspection by signing the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, which outlaws the spread of nuclear weapons. India asserts that the treaty is discriminatory because it does not apply to countries that already possess nuclear bombs. ''The intent of India has been from the very beginning to concentrate on a comprehensive program of nuclear technology exclusively for our energy needs,'' M. R. Srinivasan, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, said in an interview at the commission headquarters in Bombay. ''India's political leadership over the last 40 years has been remarkably responsible in this matter,'' Dr. Srinivasan added. ''It has not launched a weapons program in spite of the fact that the technology basis of the Indian energy program is quite comprehensive.'' Indian officials also dismissed as ''absurd'' and ''inaccurate'' news reports this week that large quantities of Norwegian heavy water, a material used in nuclear reactors, was illegally diverted to India four years ago. Indian spokesmen asserted that all the heavy water used by India is either produced in India or imported from the Soviet Union. Plutonium by the Ton: 5 Kilograms for a Bomb Despite the controversy over the heavy water, nuclear proliferation experts say they are much more concerned about India's large accumulation of plutonium that does not fall under international safeguards or inspections. Experts say it takes only five to eight kilograms of plutonium for one nuclear bomb. Dr. Srinivasan said that India's stockpile of plutonium outside international safeguards is expected to be thousands of kilograms in the next 10 years, but he declined to say how much plutonium is on hand at present. According to a task force report published in the United States this year by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, India ''could have accumulated'' a stockpile of 100 to 200 kilograms of plutonium by mid-1987, which it said was enough for 12 to 40 weapons. Dhirendra Sharma, a leading Indian scholar at Jawaharlal Nehru University, has estimated that enough plutonium for 50 to 100 bombs is being stockpiled. Dr. Sharma is a well-known opponent of Indian development of nuclear bombs. Still another Indian scholar, Bhabani Sen Gupta, a political scientist at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi, said in an interview that he had ''no doubt that India has laid out a considerable infrastructure for becoming a nuclear power.'' He said that although India had shown it could produce the weapons themselves, it probably would not proclaim itself a nuclear power until the mid-1990's - after it had tested and developed its missiles, improved its command-and-control systems and started to formulate a nuclear strategy. ''When we do take the decision, India should be able to emerge as a credible, medium-sized nuclear power, not 30 years behind China,'' said Mr. Sen Gupta. But senior Indian officials reject the idea that their nuclear research and plutonium-production programs are intended for military purposes. ''We've lived for 23 years without exercising the weapons option,'' a senior Indian official said. ''If we had pursued a weapons path, the K.G.B. and the C.I.A. would have been screaming blue murder by now. They aren't, because we aren't doing so.'' Dr. Srinivasan said that estimates about the potential number of bombs possessed by India overlooked India's requirement of plutonium for its energy needs. For example, he said at least 50 kilograms of plutonium was used in 1985 to start up a new ''fast breeder'' test reactor commissioned as a forerunner for a new generation of advanced power plants. ''To make a calculation that a country has got so many reactors, and it has got plutonium-making capability, and then to work up some numbers of bombs, is really a figment of imagination,'' he said. ''Some people keep saying these things, but facts are different.'' Pakistan Versus India: Source of Instability In recent years, much international attention has focused on mounting evidence that India's rival, Pakistan, has developed a clandestine nuclear weapons program in spite of its denials. Prime Minister Gandhi has accused the United States of permitting Pakistan to make bombs even though American aid bars such a program. Mr. Gandhi has also said that if Pakistan were to develop or set off a bomb, India would give serious consideration to a weapons program of its own. Only last month, the Indian Defense Minister, K. C. Pant, declared that India would be seen as ''not at a disadvantage'' if Pakistan developed a bomb, a comment many diplomats viewed as another sign of India's quiet preparations in the area. Western diplomats and others say that the greatest threat to the stability of South Asia is the potential of a nuclear arms race. American diplomats have tried several times to promote a nuclear agreement between India and Pakistan. Indian officials say such an accord should not be confined to only two countries, and that at the very least China must also be a part. India and China fought a war in 1962 and continue to have serious suspicions on their mutual border. Fears about Pakistan's nuclear research program have centered on reports that Pakistan has been secretly making enriched uranium with the use of equipment smuggled from the West. President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq and other Pakistani leaders insist that Pakistan is not making a bomb, but they also dismiss India's denials as untrustworthy. The focus of concern about India's plans focus largely on its plutonium, although some point to India's ambitious space missile program as further evidence that the country is preparing to become a nuclear power, perhaps in the next century. After an initial test run that was a failure, for example, a newly developed Indian-made 80-foot missile is due to be launched this summer in an attempt to send a 330-pound satellite into orbit. Indian officials agreed to an unusual interview on the subject, in part to rebut the contention that the plutonium is for use in anything other than an energy program. Nuclear Energy Policy: Aiming for 10% of Needs The Indian argument is based on the country's long-term nuclear energy strategy, which is aimed at helping the country to meet 10 percent of its energy needs, or 10,000 megawatts, from nuclear power by the end of the century. At present, nuclear power meets only about 3 percent of India's energy needs. Most of India's energy needs are met today by coal-fired power plants and hydroelectric plants. But these sources are becoming less reliable. India's coal is considered poor in quality and difficult to transport. And like many countries, India faces environmental and political problems in building hydroelectric dams. Starting in the 1950's, India signed nuclear energy cooperation agreements with Canada and the United States to construct two atomic power plants each. Both countries withdrew in the 1970's after India detonated its bomb, but the Canadian- and American-assisted plants remain under international safeguards. Indian officials acknowledge that after New Delhi exploded its bomb in 1974, and Western governments refused to provide assistance, its nuclear program was severely set back. But in time, India developed its own nuclear power capabilities to build two more atomic power plants on its own. Many analysts thus say that in the long run, India benefited by being cut off from outside aid because it was forced to develop its own capability. ''India's refusal to accept safeguards really hurt them by shutting off access to the best outside technology,'' a Western diplomat said. ''It has taken them maybe six to eight years to get back up to speed. But I'm sure they feel it has been worth it.'' Dr. Srinivasan said the biggest difficulties have been producing reactor components domestically at reasonable cost, and producing India's own heavy water. He said that in addition to the six nuclear power plants operating at present, eight more are expected to be commissioned in the next several years and another 10 are on the drawing boards. ''This means that we have, in a sense, gone from an early phase of rather slow development to a much faster development,'' he said. ''And of course, this is not the end of the road.'' Self-Sufficiency Gets Soviet Shot in Arm But in what many diplomats regarded as a surprising development, India recently shifted course somewhat in its insistence on self-sufficiency, and agreed in principle to import two Soviet-built nuclear power plants that use technology based on the principle of enriched uranium. Dr. Srinivasan said India set aside many misgivings in agreeing to accept the Soviet offer because of its huge energy needs. Like the American and Canadian reactors of two decades ago, the Soviet-built reactors are to be subjected to outside inspection to make sure they have nothing to do with a weapons program. In addition, he said, the Soviet Union would agree to take back the nuclear waste from the reactors. Dr. Srinivasan said the Soviet agreement had yet to be made final. Under the technology that India uses, plutonium - as opposed to enriched uranium - is produced as part of the waste from its nuclear power reactors. For it to be of any further use, the plutonium must then be extracted at one of two Indian reprocessing plants, soon to be joined by a third plant. In fact, plutonium has no use as a fuel in any of the power plants that India expects to build in the next several years. For this reason, many outside experts say they suspect it is being stored for weapons. India says it hopes eventually to use plutonium as a fuel in the next generation of power plants, which are still in the testing phase. These new plants, known as fast breeder reactors, are not expected to be functioning until well into the next century, Dr. Srinivasan said. In the meantime, he said, the plutonium must be produced and stored to meet their needs when they come on line. ''It takes time to accumulate the material required for a reactor load,'' he said, noting that one of the new generation of reactors would likely use up ''a few thousand'' kilograms of plutonium and that ''it takes time to build that up.'' Home-Built Reactors Not Covered by Limits Under its original agreements with Canada and the United States, any plutonium that came originally from the four reactors built by them must still be ''safeguarded'' for inspection to make sure it is not used to make weapons. But fuel from domestically built reactors, soon to become the majority, do not have to be safeguarded. A breakthrough in India's nuclear program occurred in 1985, when India commissioned its first fast breeder test reactor outside the city of Madras. The eventual advantage of these reactors is supposed to be that they can use raw material available in India, and theoretically will eventually lead to a process that produces more nuclear fuel than is consumed. At that point, which experts say is not likely to come for another 25 years, India would potentially have an unlimited supply of nuclear energy. Dr. Srinivasan asserted that despite of India's refusal to permit inspections by outsiders at its domestically built nuclear installations, its program was basically an ''open regime'' and that it had arranged for visitors to tour every one of its plants. ''We have been receiving people in all our centers all the time,'' he said. ''There are no establishments which are barred to visitors. We have maintained good links with the international nuclear community. And we certainly don't have clandestine programs.''",1988-05-07T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

Officials of the Long Island Power Authority met with officials of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission today to discuss together, for the first time, the fate of the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station. As much as anything, the meeting was a chance for the power authority, which was formed to take control of and dismantle the Long Island plant, to show the nuclear agency that it was up to the task. Next month the agency plans to apply to the commission to take over Shoreham from its owner, the Long Island Lighting Company. But officials from the commission said it was too early to tell whether the authority was capable of carrying out its plan for Shoreham. Of particular concern, they said, is the cost of the decommissioning plan. Financial Question Raised Under the authority's plan, said Richard M. Kessel, the group's chairman, the cost of maintaining and decommissioning the $5.5 billion plant would be borne entirely by Lilco. But Dr. Thomas E. Murley, director of the commission's office of nuclear reactor regulation, said he was concerned about the plant incurring unforeseen costs that could not be paid for. ''We'll have to look at the financial aspects very carefully,'' said Dr. Murley, who led the meeting. ''We can't say today whether they're qualified under our regulations.'' Completed in 1984 after 11 years of work, Shoreham underwent a successful test run but was never used to generate electricity. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Suffolk County officials opposed the plant, arguing that Long Island could not be safely evacuated if a nuclear accident occurred. After a protracted battle, Lilco agreed last year to sell the plant to the state for $1. In return, the utility was guaranteed 10 years of rate increases. Federal Approval Essential The agreement between the state and the utility has been completed, but Shoreham's license cannot be transferred without the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval. Meanwhile the plant stands idle on the North Shore of Long Island. The nuclear fuel has been removed from the reactor, but further decommissioning work will not begin until the transfer has been made. In today's meeting, Mr. Kessel said he did not intend to re-argue the merits of operating or not operating Shoreham. ''We don't view it as a political issue,'' he said. ''We view it as a technical issue.'' With that in mind, he and officials from the New York Power Authority -which would be in charge of the technical aspects of the decommissioning -spent much of the meeting outlining their proposal for taking over and shutting the plant. Immediate plans include hiring consultants to undertake the decommissioning; reviewing a study, which is to be completed this month, on the merits of converting Shoreham to a gas-fired power plant, and filing the license transfer application with the N.R.C. After the meeting, in which officials from the commission returned several times to the question of finances, Dr. Murley said he had confidence in the authority's seriousness, as well as in the technical expertise that the authority had through the New York Power Authority. ''They clearly have done a lot of thinking, and we have high regard for the capability of the New York Power Authority,'' he said.",1990-05-25T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region
3241f701-290b-4e08-ab32-021cf0ec1bb0,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/world/asia/bataan-nuclear-plant-never-opened-now-a-tourism-site.html,"A Nuclear Plant, And a Dream, Fizzles","MORONG, the Philippines — It is the nuclear plant of regrets, of would haves and could haves, to a generation of Filipino scientists who had dreamed of bringing nuclear power to this energy-starved country. The Bataan Nuclear Power Plant here sits about 45 miles west of the nation’s capital across Manila Bay, nearly at the tip of a peninsula rich in historical resonance and volcanic activity. Completed in 1984, it seemed destined to become the first operating nuclear plant in Southeast Asia. Uranium, flown in from the United States on a chartered Boeing 747, was trucked in, and by 1986, the operators were ready for a penultimate step called core loading. Then came the Chernobyl disaster, which led the Philippines to mothball the Bataan plant. Last year, just when years of patient lobbying by Philippine nuclear power advocates appeared to be paying off, the Fukushima disaster occurred. “We could have been the first nuclear country in Southeast Asia, but we were not able to do it,” said Mauro Marcelo, a nuclear engineer at the National Power Corporation, the state-owned utility. “There are several dates when we could have become a nuclear country, but every time a catastrophic event happened. We don’t need to hire nuclear experts but feng shui masters to get rid of the bad luck.” Still reeling from Fukushima, the plant’s owners have decided to turn it into a tourist attraction, featuring a tour of the containment building. The plant, which has never generated a watt of electricity, is now producing revenues from the flow of tourists from the Philippines and abroad, especially Japan. Tours of the plant, whose owners sold off the uranium in 1997, are booked months ahead, said Dennis Gana, a spokesman for the utility. On a recent tour, the Bataan plant’s supporters were clearly cheered by the surprising success of the tourism project. They now made their case for nuclear power to captive audiences, describing it as critical to the Philippines, whose economy is hobbled by one of the highest electricity rates in Asia because of its reliance on fossil fuels. The Philippines, the first country in Southeast Asia to consider nuclear power, they said, was now surrounded by nations, like Vietnam and Malaysia, that are moving to adopt nuclear power. The Philippines, outpaced by its neighbors in economic development, would fall further behind. They ushered tourists into the plant, which had been left largely the way it was when Westinghouse built it a quarter of a century ago. A green rotary phone — a hot line to the office of the country’s president — sat prominently in the main control room. The handful of employees in charge of the plant’s “preservation” expertly led visitors through a labyrinth of thick concrete walls and steel doors inside which the tropical humidity was trapped. With a showmanship befitting their new duties, they organized the tour so that it led to the pièce de résistance — the pressurized water reactor that lay nearly within touching distance from an overhead steel bridge. “It’s only here in the world that you can enter a reactor containment building and see for yourself a real reactor,” said Reynaldo Punzalan, a technician who has been working at the site since 1979 and now leads a preservation team of 20 people. For Mr. Punzalan, guiding tourists redeemed, perhaps a little, a quarter century’s frustration: daily visual inspections of the deserted plant, the routine relieved only by the monthly rotation of steam turbines and gnawing doubts about whether “they would ever start operating the plant.” There were, of course, little pleasures to be found inside the plant’s grounds, like the sweet mangoes that grew here or the wild goats that soldiers guarding the facility kept and occasionally slaughtered and roasted. But they paled next to the newfound stimulation from interacting with tourists, Mr. Punzalan said. For one, old jokes could be recycled for an appreciative audience. Take the one about the air supply pipe that hung dangerously low from the ceiling — at eye level for a six-foot-tall person — in the middle of a narrow corridor. “This is one of the non-conformances. It’s one of the defects listed. Westinghouse used to joke that this was designed for Filipinos,” Mr. Punzalan said, beating Mr. Marcelo to the story. (Mr. Marcelo retold it less than a minute later.) For Mr. Marcelo, 59, studying nuclear engineering in college “seemed the most exciting thing at the time.” But the dream of generating nuclear power in the Philippines went back even further, to the 1950s, with the influence of President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s Atoms for Peace program. In the early 1960s, the Philippines commissioned a nuclear research reactor donated by the United States. The fate of the Bataan plant has also been tied to the vagaries of Philippine politics, or more specifically to the feud between the Marcos and Aquino families that has shaped the Philippines in one form or another over the past four decades. Many of the plant’s original and current critics oppose it because it was a project of Ferdinand Marcos, the longtime American-backed ruler. The cost of the plant, originally estimated at $1.2 billion, eventually ballooned to $2.3 billion, and is believed to have filled the pockets of the Marcos family and friends. It was Corazon C. Aquino, who toppled Mr. Marcos in the “people power” revolution, who decided to mothball the plant after Chernobyl. Mrs. Aquino’s son, Benigno S. Aquino III, the current president, has publicly stated his opposition to resurrecting the plant. The biggest advocate of rehabilitating it has been a cousin of his, Mark Cojuangco, a former congressman whose side of the family broke from the current president’s half a century ago and was one of the staunchest backers of Mr. Marcos. In an interview, Mr. Cojuangco said family politics were “irrelevant” to his push to rehabilitate the plant, which, he said, should remain in government hands. Critics are skeptical. Mr. Cojuangco’s father, Eduardo, controls San Miguel, the beverage giant that has been moving into the energy sector and has expressed interest in acquiring the Bataan plant. So for now family politics do not favor the plant’s rehabilitation. And, of course, there are still strong headwinds from Fukushima. A dozen Japanese tourists recently peppered Mr. Punzalan, the technician, with questions about the safety of nuclear power. One of them, Fumie Shutoh, 59, said she had joined the tour to educate herself about nuclear power. “Because of Fukushima, I felt that I couldn’t trust what the government told us about nuclear power,” Ms. Shutoh said. After the Japanese group’s bus pulled away, Mr. Punzalan, 57, who has yet to give up hope of seeing the plant operate before retiring, said, “It was a tough crowd.”",2012-02-14T04:21:52.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The investigation has led to the most recent of seven planned and unplanned shutdowns of the $4.5 billion plant, which began licensed testing at up to 5 percent of full power on July 6. John Leonard, the Lilco vice president for nuclear testing, called the faulty indicators the most vexing problem discovered during the testing. Emergency Cooling System The testing, which is required by Federal regulations, is designed to uncover technical shortcomings so that they may be corrected before a nuclear plant operates at full power. The indicators are designed to tell plant operators the level of water inside the reactor vessel, where a nuclear reaction heats water into steam that is used to generate electricity. The indicators trigger an emergency cooling system if the water level in the core falls abnormally low. Jack R. Strosnider, an official of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in King of Prussia, Pa., said Lilco could not complete the low-power testing program and seek a license to operate the plant at higher power levels until the indicators were fixed. ''They seem to be having more trouble with this at Shoreham than we have seen at other nuclear plants,'' he said. But he added that few other significant problems had been reported. He said the low-power testing is more than 70 percent complete. The General Electric Company, the designer of Shoreham's boiling-water-design reactor, said its engineers were helping Lilco search for the cause of the inaccurate readings. Federal officials said Lilco reported the readings to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Sept. 8 as an ''unusual event'' - one of several terms used to classify incidents at nuclear power plants - after some of the indicators showed higher water levels in the reactor core than were present. According to Lilco, the plant shut down around 9 A.M. Sept. 12 when a Lilco technician investigating the indicators touched a valve equipped with a shutdown device. Problem 'Not Unique' A Lilco spokesman, Michael J. McConnell, said the investigation would continue while the plant is shut down and after it has resumed producing low levels of power. He said the company did not consider the situation serious. ''This type of problem during low-power testing is not unique to Shoreham,'' he said. A General Electric spokesman, David J. Crowley, agreed with the utility's view. ''What's happening at Shoreham is not unusual for a nuclear plant,'' he said. ''You could liken it to sea trials for a ship. The whole purpose is to shake out the system.'' Mr. Crowley said water-level indicators had not been a concern, so far as he knew, at any of the 55 nuclear plants of General Electric design operating in the United States and abroad. Lilco's current difficulties are being watched closely by members of the Suffolk County Legislature who oppose the commercial operation of the plant. Under Federal regulations, the plant cannot open until the Government has approved a local emergency-response plan to go into operation in the event of a plant accident that requires the evacuation of nearby areas. A majority of legislators oppose a county role in emergency preparedness and have effectively blocked any plan.",1985-09-17T09:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,metropolitan-desk-new-york

Mayo A. Shattuck III could be the first. As the chief executive of Constellation Energy, a utility holding company in Baltimore that already operates five nuclear reactors, Mr. Shattuck is convinced that nuclear power is on the verge of a renaissance, ready to provide reliable electricity at a competitive price. He has already taken the first steps toward achieving that, moving recently to order critical parts for a new reactor. But Constellation's neighboring utility, the PPL Corporation, takes a different view. Even though PPL has successfully operated two reactors since 1983, its chairman, William F. Hecht, said that he had no plans for new nuclear plants. When nuclear reactors were first commercialized almost half a century ago, every self-respecting electric utility wanted one. They were encouraged by a government that saw nuclear energy as a peaceful, redemptive byproduct of the deadly power unleashed at Hiroshima. The federal official for promoting nuclear energy, Lewis L. Strauss, said it would produce electricity ''too cheap to meter.'' It has never given consumers anything like that. But with the industry now consolidated so that most reactors are in the hands of a comparatively few operators, utility executives are sharply divided over whether nuclear power offers an attractive choice as they seek to satisfy a growing demand for electricity. For them, the question comes down not so much to safety and environmental impact but to whether the potential reward is worth the financial risk. And those who already operate several reactors are prone to want more. The debate within the utility industry over reviving nuclear power has taken on added importance, though, because unlike plants that burn coal and other fossil fuels, reactors do not produce gases that contribute to global warming. And once again, Washington is encouraging utilities to push ahead. The summer of 2005's energy bill offered a generous production tax credit, insurance against regulatory delays and loan guarantees. Earlier legislation gave the industry money to help plan new plants. And they continue to benefit from a ceiling on liability damages in case of an accident. Despite nuclear power's promise as a clean energy source that could hold down emissions of global warming gases, most environmentalists are skeptical of the latest claims by its advocates. They say that utilities, at best, will move ahead with a handful of plants that will receive lavish incentives from the government. But the risks of nuclear power are still so high, they argue, that no utility will be willing to put its own money into building a plant unless the federal government heavily subsidizes it. ''What dismays me about the present situation is the extent to which the Congress and the administration, and now an occasional state legislature, have rushed to anoint it as the solution to climate change,'' said Peter A. Bradford, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and former chairman of the public service commissions of both Maine and New York. If nuclear plants cannot compete without subsidies, he said, they should not be built. Today, nuclear power supplies just under 20 percent of the electricity used in the United States. Its share has been slipping lately as new plants running on other fuels have come online. With the price of natural gas increasing, coal has emerged once again as the most popular way to generate electricity, a trend that -- if it continues -- is expected to lead to a significant rise in emissions of carbon dioxide. The utility sector emits about a third of the carbon dioxide produced in this country, nearly all of that from coal. Adding dozens more nuclear reactors to that mix could reverse the rise in carbon dioxide from the electricity-generating system, but its advance would also run up against certain limits. Nuclear plants cannot replace all of the fossil fuel used in power generation because current nuclear designs do not easily alter the power output. Plants running on natural gas and coal, by contrast, can adjust their output over the course of a day to match demand. For a long time, the underlying confidence of utilities in nuclear technology was moot because the economics would not support a new reactor; all those ordered after 1973 were canceled. But now, because of high prices for natural gas and uncertainty about how emissions from coal plants will be regulated in the future, the nuclear industry is moving from near death to the prospect that perhaps a handful of plants will be ordered in the next few years. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission counts 27 potential reactors under consideration; 103 are now operable. For all the momentum behind the push, however, there is still a high degree of skepticism within the utility industry. PPL, for example, has successfully operated two reactors in Berwick, Pa., for 23 years. But with some utilities around the country making preliminary moves or joining consortiums to explore new designs, PPL is absent. There are better places to put the money of shareholders, Mr. Hecht of PPL said. At the moment he sees a much greater advantage in cleaning up his coal-fired plants, investing $1.5 billion to scrub out most of the sulfur dioxide. That would not only benefit the environment but also generate pollution credits PPL can profitably sell. That decision was ''dull and basic,'' Mr. Hecht said, but adheres to a paramount goal: maximizing shareholder returns. He won't rule out nuclear plants forever, Mr. Hecht said in an interview, but the business case would have to be a lot clearer than it is now. ''Technology often has zealots, it seems, behind it,'' he said of companies moving forward on nuclear power. By contrast, Constellation Energy not only wants to build reactors for itself, it also has formed a partnership with a reactor manufacturer to build and operate them for other utilities. ''This organization has a history of feeling that they have done well in nuclear,'' Mr. Shattuck said. Constellation executives think that they ''can continue to do well in nuclear and shouldn't shy away from their responsibility.'' Constellation plans to apply for a reactor-operating license by the end of 2007, probably at either the Calvert Cliffs site in Maryland where it runs two nuclear reactors built in the 1960's and 1970's, or at Nine Mile Point, in Scriba, N.Y., on Lake Ontario, where it operates two reactors it bought in 2001. Its decision has implications beyond the corporate bottom line for the global environment. There are also arguments over nuclear waste and the risk of accidents. Around New York City, especially, there is concern over reactors as terrorist targets. But the risk that really matters to utility executives is financial. Among the companies that would actually build these plants, executives focus more on uncertain factors like the future price of power, the cost of producing competing fuels, and the cost of cleaning up coal plants to meet standards for the pollutants that Washington does regulate -- sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and soot. At this point companies do not face any constraints on carbon emissions. Companies that want to build -- among them Entergy, Dominion and Duke Energy -- talk about new designs intended to further reduce the risk of an accident and their ability to manage nuclear waste until the government eventually opens a national waste repository. Opponents often cite the risk of accidents and the problem of nuclear waste, but the companies that do not want to build say that those are not factors in their decisions. When PPL builds a power plant, it usually sells the power first, and uses the signed contracts to reassure the investors and the bankers from whom it is seeking financing. ''I'm not going to build any large generation unhedged,'' Mr. Hecht said. But this is not easy with a nuclear plant. For one thing, Mr. Hecht said, no one could be sure when it would be finished. And despite the industry's efforts to shorten the time from order to completion, it could still be 10 years, he said. ''If you build 1,000 megawatts,'' he asked, ''how are you going to find someone to buy it 10 years out, for 10 years after it is finished?'' A nuclear plant ordered in 2007 could well turn out to be a more economical power source in 2020 than a coal plant ordered at the same time, he said, but the range of uncertainty is much larger. He is content to let others take the lead. Constellation Energy insists it is driving risk out of the proposition. Constellation, which doubled its nuclear bet in the 1990's by buying more reactors as the utility industry reorganized, contends that it has demonstrated one marketable skill -- running reactors profitably -- and that it could quickly follow a new plant with a copycat, building both on time and on budget. Constellation has an expertise gained in the early, difficult years of nuclear power, Mr. Shattuck said, citing Michael J. Wallace, president of his company's generation division. ''Mike is the only executive in the utility sector today who was an executive responsible for building new nuclear plants last time around,'' he said. Mr. Wallace oversaw the construction and start-up of two nuclear plants built in Illinois: Byron, which fully entered commercial service in 1987, and Braidwood, the following year. Constellation proposes a fleet of plants, identical down to the ''carpeting and wallpaper,'' Mr. Shattuck said, reducing the design costs on subsequent reactors to near zero. Operating processes would be identical, and operators could be shuffled among the plants, something that is often impossible today even with adjacent reactors. The company wants partners that would offer either equity or operating skills. Constellation has a partnership, called UniStar Nuclear, with Areva, the French-German company, which is owned by Framatome and Siemens, to build a model. One model is under construction in Finland. ''A lot of it is establishing a model that mitigates risk as you move forward,'' Mr. Shattuck said. ''A lot of players out there haven't quite figured out how they're going to go to their boards and ask for $4 billion, for which I'll get cash flows in 13 years.'' Last December, Constellation and FPL, parent of Florida Power and Light, announced that they would merge, creating the country's largest competitive marketer of power. That would put the company in an even better position to build new reactors, Mr. Shattuck said. Some experts, however, remain skeptical that new reactors should be built, although they acknowledge this is increasingly likely. In the last 20 years or so, said Mr. Bradford, the former regulator, utility restructuring has often shifted the risks of new construction from ratepayers to investors. ''What the Congress has done now, for the first six or so plants, is to find a third pocket,'' he said. ''Now they've called upon the taxpayer to pony up.'' But even if a few plants are built, industry insiders do not expect nuclear power to assume a significantly greater role. Roger W. Gale, an electricity expert and former Energy Department official, asks several hundred utility executives each year what they foresee in their industry. While they are convinced that a new plant will be ordered soon, the more than 100 senior utility executives who responded also said they do not expect ''a future where nuclear generation represents a larger share of generation'' than today.

Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said firing on a nuclear power plant “violates the fundamental principle” that a nuclear site’s physical integrity must be maintained at all times. LVIV, Ukraine — Russia captured Europe’s largest nuclear power plant before dawn on Friday in Ukraine, prompting questions about why it invaded the sprawling reactor site and the health risks to Ukrainians should combat at such sites lead to a nuclear disaster. For the moment, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex seized on Friday appears safe, with the plant’s array of sensitive detectors finding no releases of radioactivity above the usual background levels. The site, on the Dnieper River, not only has six reactors but acres of ponds where spent fuel rods are cooled. Experts fear that an errant shell or missile might set off an environmental disaster and, if a fire broke out, release clouds of radioactive particles that get carried by the wind around Europe. “The thing you worry about is an ignorant soldier who is scared and fires off a rocket or a mortar that causes a calamity,” said David Albright, a physicist and president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a private group in Washington that tracks nuclear arms and matériel. An accident of that nature could pose enormous dangers to Ukrainians and people in surrounding countries, including Russia. A threat of that kind emerged during Friday’s assault on facilities adjacent to the reactors at Zaporizhzhia. Video The exchange of munitions was followed by a fire that was contained to a training building on the perimeter of the complex. A Russian shell hit the No. 1 reactor, but its thick walls allowed it to survive the blow, said Petro Kotin, the acting president of Energoatom, the state company that runs Ukraine’s nuclear energy facilities. International observers and Ukrainian officials said that as of 6 a.m. on Friday, the complex was able to function safely. Mr. Kotin said that the Russian forces had allowed the nuclear plant’s operations to continue at a normal pace since they took over the complex. Still, should an accident occur in which the reactor fuel overheats and melts the reactor’s core or shielding, it could be a repeat of the meltdowns that happened in 1979 at Three Mile Island near Harrisburg, Penn.; in 1986 at Chernobyl in Ukraine; and in 2011 at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan, experts say. Further combat at Zaporizhzhia could pose an additional danger involving the site’s spent fuel rods, which contain up to roughly 30 tons of the high toxic metal plutonium, according to an estimate by Mr. Albright and two colleagues. “Firing shells in the area of a nuclear power plant,” Rafael M. Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency said, “violates the fundamental principle” that seeks to maintain a nuclear site’s physical integrity at all times. Speaking at an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting on Friday, Russia’s ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, denied his country had purposely targeted the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex and challenged Ukrainian officials’ account that Russian troops attacked the plant and that the fire started as a result of the gun battle. He maintained that Russian forces patrolling outside of the nuclear plant had come under fire from Ukrainian militants inside the training building and had returned fire. He said the Ukrainians had then set the building on fire. Experts said one possible motive for the Russian takeover of the Zaporizhzhia complex was the slow degradation of Ukraine’s power grid, which could throw nuclear power plants offline and result in cascading blackouts. “The Russians understand that energy is a massive tool of power,” said R. Scott Kemp, a professor of nuclear science at M.I.T. “It’s a point of tremendous leverage.” A darker possibility relates to nuclear weapons manufacture. Russia may be motivated to seize Ukraine’s nuclear energy plants in part to gather atomic material for itself or to close off an unlikely and difficult path for Kyiv to acquire a nuclear weapon.

8b40512d-58fa-51a6-9748-0de40522c8a9,https://www.tipsproject.eu/tips/,"For a Russian Builder of Nuclear Plants, Business Is Booming","MOSCOW, June 6 — The Russian nuclear power company Atomstroyexport has been roundly criticized for helping Iran build its nuclear program. But neither that project nor the company’s mouthful of a name has hurt its business prospects. A former branch of the Soviet atomic energy ministry, Atomstroyexport (pronounced atom-stroy-EXPORT) has been the Kremlin’s main instrument to meet rising global demand for nuclear power, now mainly from developing countries. And Russia’s state company may just be the right kind of provider, willing to deal with governments that other nuclear power companies shun. “We’re talking about a nuclear renaissance,” Sergei I. Shmatko, the chief executive of Atomstroyexport, said in a recent interview in the company’s headquarters in Moscow. “We are certain we have a market.” Atomstroyexport is building seven nuclear reactors — in Iran, China, Bulgaria and India — more reactors, it claims, than any competitor, particularly Westinghouse and General Electric of the United States, Siemens of Germany or Areva of France. Westinghouse, for example, has contracts for four new reactors in China, but has not begun work. It is a subcontractor or supplier at other sites, including six in South Korea, but is not the primary builder, a spokesman, Vaughn Gilbert, said in a telephone interview. Reactors designed by Westinghouse, however, remain the most prevalent in the world — 45 percent of currently operating reactors. In raising capital and gearing up for new construction, the Russians are betting on an outlook that not everybody shares. Regardless of what choices are made in America, Japan and Europe, which remain wary of new nuclear power plants, the world is poised for another boom in construction, reminiscent of the 1960s and 1970s, as one nation after another seeks alternatives to the fossil fuels that are a culprit in global warming. Today, 26 power plants are under construction worldwide, in countries from Argentina to Romania, according to the International Energy Agency. Of these, only two are being built in developed economies — one each in Finland and Japan. Still, some industry experts project that future demand will come from the developed economies, including the United States. Steven C. Kerekes, spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, representing owners and operators of nuclear plants in the United States, said he expected that utilities would build 30 reactors in the next 15 to 20 years. The United States now operates 104 nuclear reactors, more than any other country. The Russians, meanwhile, are in talks with Vietnam, Malaysia, Egypt, Namibia, Morocco, South Africa, Algeria, Brazil, Chile and Argentina, according to Mr. Shmatko. In a sign of the Russians’ reach into markets others might avoid, last month the Russian company opened negotiations for a research reactor in Myanmar, formerly Burma, a country ruled by a junta. In Iran, critics say, the Russian company’s work on the Bushehr plant gives the Iranian government a justification to enrich uranium, which the United States says could also be used to make bomb-grade fissile material. The Russians counter that the reactor itself is harmless if looked at separately from the effort to enrich uranium fuel. They say the site on the Persian Gulf complies with international treaties and does not contribute to nuclear proliferation. But Atomstroyexport seems eager to rebrand itself as a modern corporation with global reach and interests — not merely as the supplier of nuclear expertise to Iran. Indeed, analysts of nuclear proliferation have not been easy on the company. Many say its narrow business interests have needlessly exposed the United States, Europe, Israel and possibly even Russia, too, to the risk that Iran may one day be able to build a nuclear bomb. Mr. Shmatko said in the interview in his office that the $1 billion project no longer even appeared profitable to the Russians and his company, because of rising prices for stainless steel and a shortage of skilled labor in the nuclear industry. He suggested that it was a drag rather than a benefit for Russia’s nuclear business. Yet the Iran contract is only a small part of the company’s global work and its expansive plans in the developing world. Atomstroyexport hopes to win $5 billion to $10 billion in new business in the coming two years, Mr. Shmatko said. In doing so, he said the company was shaking off Russia’s dark legacy of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster by convincing foreign governments of engineering advances in Russian designs since then. Mr. Shmatko said his company’s plant in Tianwan, China, is the first in the world to use a “core catcher,” a meltdown-control technology designed to trap the molten slug of uranium in a meltdown and prevent it from burrowing into the earth. The company, he said, is also introducing a new design for emerging markets. It has a line of minireactors more typical of the power plants for nuclear submarines or ice breakers. They are sized to fit the limited capacity of ramshackle electricity grids in developing countries, he said. Industrial reactors typically produce around 1,000 megawatts of electricity, enough to power a million American homes. Atomstroyexport says it will market reactors in the 300- to 600-megawatt range. Indeed, with the potential profits at stake, Western investors, including such heavyweights as Citigroup, are seeking ways to bet on the Russian nuclear power industry. Russia is pushing a business model that bundles nuclear fuel supplies with power plant construction contracts and that seeks to ensure that spent fuel — a potential ingredient for dirty bombs or fission weapons — is returned to Russia for storage. “The world has no alternative but to develop nuclear energy,” Mr. Shmatko, a former accountant, said. For now, investors can buy Atomstroyexport corporate bonds that were issued last month and attracted European and American investment houses. The Russian-registered subsidiary of JPMorgan, for example, bought into the $58 million offering, according to Atomstroyexport. A spokeswoman for JPMorgan said it had held only a “very short-term trading position” in the bond and no longer owned any Atomstroyexport bonds. Subsidiaries of a related company, Tvel, which makes fuel rods, trade on Russian exchanges. Citigroup owns about 5 percent of the Priargunsk uranium mine that is part of the Tvel group, according to the mine’s Web site. On May 31, Sergei V. Kiriyenko, a former prime minister and head of the Russian atomic energy agency, said the government planned to consolidate nuclear assets into a state-controlled holding — a sort of Gazprom of nuclear power — to be called Atomenergoprom. That company would incorporate not only Atomstroyexport and Tvel but also uranium mines and companies that make fuel rod assemblies and specialized equipment like gas centrifuges for enriching uranium. Subsidiaries will most likely be open to foreign investment, analysts say. For Russia, the business of building nuclear power plants complements its business in fossil fuels. In fact, Russia’s business of maintaining Soviet-designed plants in Eastern Europe may get a boost as these countries worry about excess dependency on Russian natural gas from Gazprom and reconsider nuclear energy as an alternative. Atomstroyexport’s exact ownership, meanwhile, is something of a mystery. Organized as a joint stock company, it is 50.2 percent owned, and clearly controlled, by the Russian government. The rest of the shares, the company’s Web site says, are owned by “Gazprombank group companies.” Marina V. Alekseenkova, an industrial analyst with Renaissance Capital in Moscow and an authority on publicly traded companies in the Russian nuclear industry, said that the phrasing shed little light on the private shareholders in the company, believed to be industry and government insiders. And those already concerned about Russia’s role in the spread of nuclear technology should consider this: the Russian Atomic Energy agency is looking into developing floating reactors built on pontoons. The Russians envision a product that could be towed into ports in the developing world and hooked to the local power grid, for a fee. “We are, generally speaking, the absolute monopoly here,” Russia’s first deputy prime minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, said of the floating reactors. “Nobody apart from us is able or knows how to build them.”",2007-06-12T06:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business
a45d775e-3ad8-4734-aaab-e2c4af057ca8,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/business/global/14energy.html,&#8216;,"HANOVER, Germany — Josef Mehrer, a family-owned German company established more than 120 years ago, has survived by adapting with the times. Early on, it made sewing machines, then machines for cleaning beer vats, then it switched to compressors in the 1950s. In the early 1990s, the company placed a bet on the renewable energy sector and started to make compressors for the emerging biogas industry. Jörg-Peter Mehrer, the fifth generation to run the business, says he believes he made the right move — especially after Chancellor Angela Merkel announced last month a safety review of Germany’s nuclear industry in light of the disaster in Japan. “This is a market that keeps expanding,” Mr. Mehrer said. “The government’s decision is very positive.” Mehrer, which was exhibiting its products at the Hanover International Trade Fair last week, was just one of many companies, large and small, that were seeking an opportunity in what may turn out to be a significant reordering of energy sources in Germany, Europe’s largest economy. The show highlighted the different paths European countries are taking toward energy security. While some of Germany’s neighbors, like nuclear-dependent France, home to the giant contractor Areva, criticize Mrs. Merkel for what they call an exaggerated, knee-jerk reaction, Germans seem determined to move toward a postnuclear economy — even though they acknowledge the switch will be expensive. Many companies at the exhibition said that they had begun to position themselves in the market more than a decade ago, even before the former left-leaning government passed a law in 2002 to close all of Germany’s nuclear plants by 2022. The conservative Mrs. Merkel, pushed by her pro-business coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party, reversed that decision last year by agreeing to keep the nuclear plants operating well into the 2030s. She argued that nuclear power would be a “bridge technology” until the renewable sector was sufficiently developed. Nuclear energy now supplies 22.3 percent of Germany’s electricity while coal provides 42 percent, natural gas 13.6 percent and renewable energies 16.5 percent, according to the Environment Ministry. The change, however, caused confusion among companies and gave the opposition Green Party, long opposed to nuclear power, a new sense of purpose. The disaster last month in Japan reignited the debate, which reached a pitch not seen in any other European country. In response, Mrs. Merkel ordered seven of the 17 nuclear plants closed for three months while the rest underwent stringent security checks. Some of the oldest plants are expected to be closed permanently, whatever the outcome of the inspections. But it was not enough to prevent her party, the Christian Democratic Union, from losing power last month in Baden-Württemberg, a wealthy southwestern state it had led for 58 years. Instead, the once-negligible Greens emerged triumphant and will lead a state government for the first time in Germany. In part, this reflected the deeply ingrained respect for the environment that transcends political divides in Germany. Yet such a revolution is even more telling in a state where many of Germany’s famed Mittelstand companies are based. These small and midsize family businesses, like Mehrer, are the backbone of the country’s export-dependent economy. Mr. Mehrer, 40, says he is not sure what policies the Greens will pursue now in Stuttgart, the state capital. But for him, one thing is certain: “Growth is in renewables.” The view was echoed around the vast trade fair, where the latest in industrial technology was displayed. Sebastian Sax, a project manager at Schneider Electric, the global electrical systems company, said Mrs. Merkel’s decision was good for his business, too. “We focus so much on energy efficiency,” he said. “It’s something we have been doing for many years.” ABB, a Swedish engineering company with a large presence in Germany, was also enthusiastic. “Closing nuclear power plants is good news for ABB,” said Ake Andersson, technical manager of one of the company’s motors divisions. “This is about developing ways to use energy more efficiently.” Of course, support is not universal. Big nuclear energy companies like RWE and Siemens, which built all of Germany’s nuclear power plants, have balked at Mrs. Merkel’s turnaround. RWE this month appealed the decision to temporarily close Biblis A, one of two units at its Biblis Nuclear Power Plant. Its chief executive, Jürgen Grossmann, warned of “more frequent outages, say two, three days a year,” and told German radio that he feared that “the industrial foundation of our country will be lost.” Hildegard Müller, chairwoman of the German Association of Energy and Water Industries, which represents 1,800 companies, suggested that Germany could become a net importer of energy, which would increase costs. Imports of electricity from France and the Czech Republic — big users of nuclear energy — had already doubled in recent weeks because of the temporary closure of the seven nuclear plants, she said. Even the most enthusiastic supporters of renewable energy acknowledge that the move away from nuclear power will be costly, at least initially. “Of course we are pleased with the government’s decision over nuclear power,” said Christian Albrink, regional division chief of Soleg, a German company that plans and sells solar energy systems and plants. “But we have to keep a very clear head. We need clear thinking about how Germany will phase out nuclear power.” Mr. Albrink said that an energy mix of wind, biomass and solar power could be developed. “But what are needed are more storage facilities for this kind of energy,” he said. “This is a big challenge.” Specialists say substantial investments in “smart grids,” to establish an integrated technological energy network, are also needed, and a much greater push toward conservation. Joachim Schneider, vice president of the Association of Electrical, Electronic and Information Technologies, said that building roughly 3,600 kilometers, or 2,235 miles, of grids would cost from 13 billion to 21 billion euros, or $18.8 billion to $30.3 billion. Renovation of the housing stock would be costly, too. Friedhelm Loh, president of the German Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers’ Association, said that installing “smart” systems in private households to give them access to locally generated power from renewable sources, rather than being fed from big centralized plants, would be more efficient and use less energy over the long term. But it could cost 50,000 euros a home, he said. In a report published to coincide with the trade fair, Fraunhofer, one of Germany’s top research institutes, estimated that for Germany to have all of its electricity supplied by renewable sources by 2050, it would have to spend 15 billion euros a year over 15 years. That would be a lot of money, but a small fraction of Germany’s gross domestic product. Jürgen Schmidt, director of the Fraunhofer in Kassel, said he thought the investment would pay off over the long term because of substantial savings in energy efficiency and consumption. Even companies like RWE and Siemens that are heavily invested in nuclear energy are hedging their bets. “Of course, nuclear energy is very important for us,” said Manfred Lang, an RWE spokesman. “But we are increasingly active in the renewable energy sector, particularly looking at ways to store sun and wind energy.” Siemens, which is seeking a cooperation agreement with Rosatom, the Russian state nuclear power plant manufacturer, was in Hanover showing off its electric cars and all things green. Its staff even wore green ties.",2011-04-14T13:59:48.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-global-business

Just two weeks ago, the Swedish Parliament narrowly voted to allow the reactors at 10 nuclear power plants to be replaced when the old ones are shut down  a reversal from a 1980 referendum that called for them to be phased out entirely. Nuclear power fell out of favor in much of Europe after the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl, Ukraine. But in an era of concern about dependence on foreign supplies of fossil fuels and increases in atmospheric carbon, there is renewed interest in electricity generated by nuclear fission. “Over all, opinions are firming and more positive,” Ian Hore-Lacy, a spokesman for the World Nuclear Association, said of the European mood. “People are less concerned about waste because they’ve seen it’s not a drama, and it’s been well managed.” With protesters in Helsinki gathered outside, the Finnish Parliament voted 120 to 72 to back a nuclear power plant application from a consortium called Teollisuuden Voima, and 121 to 71 to approve a new plant built by Fennovoima. The companies, which have five years to submit construction license applications, hope to begin operating the plants by 2020. The vote will allow the Finns to build their sixth and seventh nuclear plants. The country’s four existing nuclear plants provide about 28 percent of Finland’s total electricity needs, according to the World Nuclear Association. Finland imports electricity, coal and gas from Russia for much of its remaining needs, and officials have expressed unease about dependence on a sometimes-difficult neighbor. The two light-water reactors, which will generate a combined 3,200 megawatts, are estimated to cost as much as 10 billion euros ($12.5 billion). Neither group has decided on a reactor design yet. Fennovoima, a Finnish consortium in which the German utility E.On holds a 34 percent stake, must first decide where to build its plant. Two possible sites, at Simo and Pyhajoki, have been identified. Teollisuuden Voima, known as TVO, is building a new-generation EPR-model plant with Areva, the French engineering company, at Olkiluoto, in the southwest. That project is running well over budget and behind schedule. Areva said on June 23 that it would book a charge of 400 million euros in the first half of the year against cost overruns, bringing its total write-downs on the plant to 2.7 billion euros. In 2005, it estimated the cost of the job at 3 billion euros. The plant had been scheduled to go online in 2009, but officials are now aiming for a 2013 start. Construction of a similar reactor in Flamanville, France, is also experiencing delays and cost overruns, leading skeptics to question whether the industry can operate without significant government aid. Nuclear power proponents argue that the technology is more environmentally sound than burning fossil fuels because no greenhouse gases are emitted to split atoms. Opponents cite concerns about the danger of accidents and long-term waste disposal. Tomas Kaberger, director general of the Swedish Energy Agency, said there was no certainty that any of the plants would be built, despite talk of a nuclear renaissance. “Historically, the industry has not been able to reduce costs with increased experience,” Mr. Kaberger said. “New reactors have not been cheaper than previous models.” Mauri Pekkarinen, the Finnish minister of economic affairs, said he was confident the plants would be built without public financing. “The companies don’t need any subsidies,” he said in an interview. “The government has nothing to do with the financing.” Most of the nuclear plants under construction today are in China. In Europe, France has long been the main nuclear proponent, generating most of its electricity from its fleet of nuclear plants, and championing its technology on the world stage. Britain is eager to build new nuclear capacity, but at a time of austerity budgets, the government has suggested that it might have to resort to a tax on carbon pollution to finance construction.",2010-07-02T04:26:56.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-global-business

They stop at seaside restaurants with cheerful red signs advertising the local delicacy, known as bamboo crab, and watch trawlers sail back to picturesque fishing villages. Yet for many of the people who actually make Yeongdeok (pronounced Young-duck) their home, life has become increasingly gloomy — and solitary. Young people leave to pursue careers in distant cities, and years of overfishing has led to skimpier catches. On weekdays, when the tourists and sightseers have left, loneliness descends. So in 2010, the 399 mostly older people who made up the population of three villages agreed to give up their land and their centuries-old way of life to make room for something few other places wanted: a nuclear power plant. That act plunged the surrounding Yeongdeok County into a bitter debate over whether the plant would be a savior or a death knell. The clash also revealed the depth of despair in South Korea ’s increasingly empty rural communities, as well as growing misgivings about the country’s heavy dependence on nuclear power. “We have no hope, no alternative other than a nuclear power plant,” said Lee Wan-seop, 54. Mr. Lee, a Yeongdeok native, believed that a power plant would bring “a great luck,” creating jobs and revenues, and arrest the county’s long decline. On the other side of the debate were villagers like Shin Wang-ki, 56, who grows pears, apples and peaches and believed that a power plant would mean the end to a longstanding and cherished way of life. “No way! Who’s going to buy fruits or crabs from an area near a nuclear power plant?” he said. “I inherited a clean land from my ancestors and want to leave it untainted for my children.” Yeongdeok, 155 miles southeast of Seoul, has some of the more beautiful vistas along the country’s east coast. Rolling waves burst into snow-white fields of foam at the foot of cliffs. For centuries, fishermen have carved their homes into the bluffs, like bird’s nests, plucking abalones and sailing out for bamboo crabs. Yet the county’s unusual pitch for a nuclear plant was driven by the same fight for survival seizing rural communities in South Korea and many other parts of the world. (Cheongsong, a county west of Yeongdeok, is campaigning for a new state prison.) Yeongdeok’s population, numbering 113,000 in 1974, has plunged to just 38,000 — nearly one-third of the people are 65 or older — and with deaths outnumbering births four to one, it is expected to shrink further. The county can supply only 8.8 percent of its budget on its own; the central government makes up the rest. So in 2005, when South Korea sought a storage site for low-level radioactive waste from its reactors but faced often violent protests from many communities, Yeongdeok volunteered. But Yeongdeok lost out to a rival bidder, Gyeongju to the south, after a greater percentage of residents, 89.5 percent, agreed to put the radioactive dump there. Five years later, when Yeongdeok learned of the government’s search for sites for new nuclear power plants, it did not want to lose out again. This time, it won the approval of all residents of the three villages offered as a site, as well as from all seven members of the County Council, before applying to the government. Kim Il-kwang, a fisherman, said he had few qualms about vacating Seokri, the village where his family has lived for nine generations, chiefly because it was dying a natural death anyway. Five hundred people lived there when he was young. Most of the 100 or so who remain are so old, Mr. Kim said, that he was considered “on the younger side.” Mr. Kim is 72. “If someone had to give up their village for Yeongdeok, we thought we might as well sacrifice ours,” he added. “Compensation we hoped to get for moving out would also be the best price we could ever expect for our land.” With no oil or gas reserves, South Korea must import almost all of its energy resources and finds nuclear power the cheapest way to keep its industries supplied with electricity. Its 24 nuclear reactors generate one-third of the country’s electricity. Four reactors are under construction, and another six are set to be built by 2027, including the two here. In 2012, South Korea selected Yeongdeok and Samcheok, a coastal city to the north, as sites for new reactors. Yet by then, skepticism — and anxiety — was spreading. First came the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan . Then came another shock: Reports that emerged after a series of scandals revealed that nuclear power plants across South Korea had been using parts whose safety test results were faked. Last year, a new mayor in Samcheok called a referendum in which residents voted against the decision made under the previous mayor. When the mayor of Yeongdeok refused to do likewise, residents opposed to the plant began organizing and outside activists poured in. They called a referendum on their own in November. The government and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Company, the country’s operator of nuclear power plants, urged residents not to take part in the referendum, which they called illegal because a state project was not subject to a county-level plebiscite. They also accused the outsiders of bringing antinuclear activism here to impede an important national project. Antinuclear villagers went on hunger strikes, accusing Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power executives of bribing older villagers with watermelons and other gifts. “People yelled at each other,” said Kwon Tae-hwan, who runs a local Internet news site. “They waged a war of banners, every single back alley strung with rival placards.” About 11,000 county residents participated in the referendum. Of them, nearly 92 percent voted against a nuclear power plant. Antinuclear activists claimed victory, while the government dismissed the result and reconfirmed its plan to build a plant here. The civil disobedience in Yeongdeok was only one of the many challenges South Korea’s nuclear power industry faced, problems it never had to confront when the first reactor went into operation in 1978 under an authoritarian government. In June, a government committee warned that beginning in 2019, old plants would run out of storage space for high-level radioactive wastes. The country urgently needed to build a new, central repository for such wastes, it said. But the government could not even start looking. Residents of Miryang, a village in the southeast, have recently staged prolonged protests, including a self-immolation, to oppose a far smaller potential hazard: high-voltage transmission towers to carry electricity from a distant nuclear plant. With the referendum over, Yeongdeok was back to its old, quiet self during a recent visit. Land prices have climbed, with new houses popping up on coastal hills. But the houses largely remain empty as speculators hope to get the power company to buy them under a law that calls for property owners near a nuclear plant to be compensated. Amid hilltop apple orchards, giant windmills spun, facing seaward. Trawlers rested behind breakwaters. A few hikers on the coastal trail ducked splotches of foam the ocean snorted up. Harvested rice paddies were strewn with what looked like giant marshmallows: bundles of straw rolled up in white plastic. Yet beneath the calm, tensions simmered. Residents on both sides of the nuclear question are waiting for parliamentary elections in April, when candidates from Yeongdeok will be asked to take sides. “Among people here, what the government said used to be the law and truth,” said Kim Eok-nam, 47, who believed his dream of marketing organic farm produce would evaporate with the arrival of a nuclear plant. “But over this nuclear power project, we will show we are no rural pushover.”",2016-01-05T16:30:18.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The announcement of financial support — which was made by George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, on a visit to China — appeared to be a confidence-building measure aimed at wrapping up a deal, years in gestation, to build Britain’s first nuclear plant since the mid-1990s. “They are edging toward trying to sign a deal, but it is taking a long time,” said Antony Froggatt, a nuclear analyst at Chatham House, a London research organization. The British government said that it expected EDF, the French state-controlled utility leading the project, to make a final decision later this year to go ahead with the plant. If EDF moves forward, it will be supported by two Chinese companies, China General Nuclear Corporation and China National Nuclear Corporation, the government said. Mr. Osborne has been courting Chinese companies to help finance the new Hinkley Point station, which will cost at least £16 billion. “I am delighted to announce this guarantee for Hinkley Point today and to be in China to discuss their investments in Britain’s nuclear industry,” Mr. Osborne said in a statement. In trying to build nuclear plants, Britain is bucking the trend in the West. In the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan, Germany and other Western nations decided to gradually phase out nuclear power. Few plants are under construction in America and Western Europe, and two of those, in Finland and France, have encountered long delays and huge cost overruns. Despite such problems, Britain strongly backs construction of new nuclear plants. It views nuclear energy as a low-carbon source of power generation useful for meeting its targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It also worries about keeping the lights on, as its nuclear power plants — which produced about 19 percent of Britain’s electricity last year — age and regulations force utilities to close coal-fired plants. With British utilities lacking the expertise and financial strength to build a nuclear plant, the government has turned to EDF, which is backed by the French state. The British government has also signaled that it is open to other international financing, including from China and from state-controlled entities like sovereign wealth funds . Hinkley Point would provide an opening for Chinese companies to begin taking an international role in the industry. China leads the world in plants under construction at home, but its nuclear industry has only limited experience outside of China. The British effort is being closely watched by policy makers around the world and has attracted widespread interest. Along with EDF, other nuclear suppliers like Toshiba and Hitachi are pursuing British projects. The British government is not only offering financing to help with the construction but has guaranteed EDF a much higher price for the electricity it generates than current market rates. The government also says that it may increase financial support for the plant as the project progresses. Last year, the European Union approved Britain’s use of state aid to finance the plant. The government says the plant, which will be built near an existing nuclear station on the Severn Estuary, will create 25,000 jobs. It is expected to generate 7 percent of Britain’s power. Still, Britain’s effort to build nuclear plants has proceeded at what seems a glacial pace. The Hinkley Point project is already several years behind its original schedule. Centrica, a British utility, walked away from an option to take a 20 percent stake in Hinkley Point and another nuclear plant, citing frustration over delay and costs.",2015-09-21T04:04:58.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

The decision, by the United States Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia circuit, grants Shoreham's owner a new license that allows it to begin taking apart the fully operational, 809-megawatt plant. The owner, the Long Island Lighting Company, said that it would quickly move forward to decommission the plant, making the chance that it will ever operate as a nuclear plant decidedly remote. The decision is a major blow to the Department of Energy, which has portrayed Shoreham's operation as an important symbol of its commitment to nuclear energy. Earlier this month, the Justice Department, acting for the Energy Department, argued that the environmental consequences of other power sources, like fossil fuels, should be studied before the plant was abandoned. No Environmental Study Needed Yesterday's ruling rejected that argument and let stand a decision by the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission saying that no environmental study was needed before the new license, known as a ""possession only"" license, could be granted. The new license took effect at 12:01 this morning. The plant's supporters said they would continue fighting the nuclear commission's decision and appealed yesterday evening to the United States Supreme Court for an emergency stay. But with the new license in effect, Shoreham is be on an almost irrevocable path to destruction, officials say. Trying to run it now would take two to three years and cost $300 million, they say, and the time and cost will multiply once the process of dismantling begins. Richard M. Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, the state agency formed to take over and take apart the plant, said decommissioning could begin as early as October and would take about two years and cost about $186 million. Joanne Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department, said she would have no comment on yesterday's ruling. In January, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins called the decision not to operate the plant ""tragic"" and warned that it would have ""adverse consequences on energy security and reliability, the environment, the ratepayers of Long Island and the New York State economy."" But New York State, which is waiting for approval from the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission to take over and dismantle Shoreham, applauded the ruling and said it was a warning to the Federal Government not to meddle in local decisions about nuclear energy. ""I would hope that the Bush Administration would now cease its efforts to try and delay the decommissioning of Shoreham,"" said Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in a prepared statement. In 1989, after intense pressure from Mr. Cuomo and officials in Suffolk County, who argued that Long Island could not be safely evacuated in the event of a nuclear disaster, the lighting company agreed to turn the plant over to the state for $1 in return for 10 years of rate increases. Conceived in 1966, completed in 1984, and granted a full-power operating license in 1989, the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station was originally billed as an answer to Long Island's energy problems. The plant, able to provide 809 megawatts of power, or enough electricity for about one-third of the Island's 903,000 homes, was seen by proponents of nuclear power as a clean and safe alternative to the messy, aging fossil fuel plants on the Island. Never Allowed to Operate Though the plant, on a rural road in a remote village on the north shore of Suffolk County, performed successfully in low-power tests in 1985 and 1987, it was never allowed to operate. Originally budgeted at $269 million, it ended up costing $5.5 billion. In June 1989, after years of bitter debates and court battles on both sides, Lilco signed its agreement with New York State, which vowed to take over and then take apart the plant. But transferring and dismantling a power plant is hardly simple. Every modification, from the most trivial to the most-far reaching, has to be reviewed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. As a result, though the nuclear fuel has been removed from the reactor and is being stored in a spent-fuel pool inside the plant, Shoreham has been sitting in a more-or-less pristine condition for the last two years. 2 Groups Fight for Plant Meanwhile, a case for Shoreham was made in the courts and before the nuclear commission by the plant's supporters, most particularly the Shoreham-Wading River Central School District, which depends on the taxes the plant generates, and a group called Scientists and Engineers for Secure Energy, Inc. Last month, when the nuclear commission said that it planned to grant a possession-only license to Lilco, the two groups asked the United States Court of Appeals to stay that decision. The Department of Defense, represented by the Department of Justice, joined in that request, and it was that motion that was rejected yesterday. The school district and the scientists' group made the final appeal to the Supreme Court last night. Under its full-power license, Lilco was required to maintain Shoreham almost as if it were an operating plant. Many employees had to spend as much as one in six working shifts in training sessions and many of the operating systems had to be kept up. Joseph W. McDonnell, a Lilco spokesman, said Shoreham's cost under the full-power license was $400,000 a day, with about half going to taxes and half to maintain the plant. Under the new license, he said, Lilco will immediately begin saving $48,000 a day. Lilco Can Shift 100 Workers The new license relieves Lilco of many of its previous requirements. Mr. McDonnell said it would enable the lighting company to shift 100 Shoreham workers to new jobs, either in helping to decommission the plant or in other parts of the company. It will also allow Lilco to vacate many parts of the plant it had been required to maintain, though it will still follow strict safety requirements for the spent fuel and the contaminated areas. Those will be dismantled and disposed of when decommissioning begins. Now that it has agreed to the possession-only license, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is free to consider the next two issues before it: Lilco's request to transfer Shoreham to the Long Island Power Authority, a state agency, for $1, and the power authority's request to decommission it. It is unclear what will happen to Shoreham then. A business group on Long Island has proposed using the property as a terminal for a new ferry across Long Island Sound. The Long Island Power Authority has said it would be feasible to convert the plant to a 413-megawatt natural gas-fired plant, but that would require a developer with $215 million.",1991-07-20T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Mr. Williams will replace Richard P. Crouse, 46, who had been vice president, nuclear. Mr. Crouse was promoted to senior vice president, operations, duties that are in nonnuclear operations. Toledo Edison denied that the executive changes had anything to do with the recent mishap at its Davis-Besse nuclear power plant in Oak Harbor, Ohio. The plant was closed indefinitely last week after equipment failed in the system that supplies water to cool the reactor's core. Yesterday, Mr. Williams was traveling to Washington for discussions with nuclear regulatory officials about the situtation at Davis-Besse and was unavailable for comment. But John P. Williamson, chairman and chief executive of the Toledo, Ohio, utility, has characterized him as ''a doer.'' Mr. Williams, who was a senior vice president for nuclear operations for the Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company from 1983 to 1984, will join Toledo Edison July 1. A retired vice admiral, he served 37 years in the Navy, beginning as an enlisted man in 1940. He received a commission in 1944 and served on submarines from 1950 to 1956. Mr. Williams graduated from the Naval War College in 1956 and the Navy nuclear power school in 1959. He commanded a diesel-powered submarine from 1957 to 1959 and commanded two nuclear-powered Polaris submarines from 1960 to 1966 after supervising their construction. As a vice admiral, he was commander of the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, commander of the United States Atlantic submarine fleet and commander of NATO submarines. He is a graduate of the University of Maryland with a bachelor of science degree in business administration. He was director of nuclear and waterfront operations for the Electric Boat division of the General Dynamics Corporation from 1977 to 1981. He then formed a consulting firm, Williams Research and Development Associates.",1985-06-21T09:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,financial-desk-business-day

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is investigating the improper closing of safety valves at the Oyster Creek Nuclear Power Plant in Forked River, N.J. The investigation is focusing on five control-room operators involved in a decision on Sept. 11 to close the valves during routine maintenance, a violation of Federal safety standards, and an attempt to destroy documents afterward, said Karl Abraham, a spokesman for the commission. The operators have been suspended from control-room duties pending the outcome of the investigation, said Carol Clausen, a vice president of the plant's operator, the GPU Nuclear Corporation. The reactor was shut down at the time of the violation, and there was ''no consequence in terms of radiation for workers' health or the public,'' Mr. Abraham said. All Valves Were Shut The 26-inch diameter valves that were closed are critical to plant safety because they allow cooling water to flow around the reactor and allow operators to monitor water levels. There are five such valves, and two must remain open at all times. On Sept. 11, three were already closed when the remaining two were also shut. The two valves were shut as employees conducted repair work at the plant. They were closed for about two minutes and set off an alarm in the control room. Control-room operators then notified other plant officials, who informed the nuclear agency by telephone the same morning. The nuclear agency and GPU Nuclear have agreed to keep the plant shut down for an unspecified time. The plant, with an electrical generating capacity of approximately 650 megawatts an hour,, feeds power to the Jersey Central Power and Light Company of Morristown, N.J. The nuclear agency and GPU Nuclear said someone tried to tamper with printed materials that were recording the events in the control room during the incident. ''What apparently happened in the room was action to destroy some of the documents recording the events,'' Ms. Clausen said. ''Some portions of the tape were missing and later found to have been removed and crumpled.'' Last month the plant was fined $205,000 for safety violations that occurred in April. In that incident, employees used ropes to tie open certain valves in violation of the nuclear agency's guidelines. The agency's report is expected to be released in about two weeks.",1987-09-20T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Mr. Blix, a Swedish diplomat, has been director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency since 1981. He says there is a growing gap between public opinion, which on the whole remains fearful of nuclear power plants, and governments and many energy specialists who believe that atomic energy has to be used more if developing nations are to meet their soaring power demands and the world is to have any hope of significantly reducing gases that contribute to global warming. The International Atomic Energy Agency, based in Vienna, is responsible for conducting inspections in search of illegal weapons programs and for promoting nuclear safety at civilian power plants. Since the accident at Chernobyl in 1986, Mr. Blix said in an interview, nuclear power safety has been strengthened. He hears less about safety concerns from governments and more about the political problems of expanding atomic power in the face of adverse public opinion. Mr. Blix, who spoke to the environment conference last week, said that most environmental groups and some international agencies opposed to nuclear power ''are leading us into dreamland'' by calling for reliance on renewable sources like solar power, wind energy and biomass -- or living materials like trees. ''To achieve the same output of electricity of a 1,000-megawatt power plant,'' he said, ''you would need something like 50 square kilometers of solar cells or 50 square kilometers of windmills or up to 5,000 square kilometers of biomass material. We don't say that's technically impossible. But economically viable? No.'' But a recent report from the United Nations Development Program looked at a range of energy sources that could supplant coal and oil, studied ways to make present energy sources more efficient. The report concluded that nuclear power was not necessary. However, Mr. Blix said that solar power, wind energy and biomass account for only 2.5 percent of the commercial energy used around the world, and that continuing to ''pat renewables on the back and call it conservation'' is akin to being for motherhood. ''Quantify that,'' he said. ''What does that mean? Are renewables adequate to meet needs?'' He said that if the world has so far managed to create only 2 percent of its energy from sources that have always been available, that raises the question of how economical or efficient these sources are. ''Relying on 2 percent of world energy to meet our needs,'' he said, ''is a totally inadequate answer.''",1997-07-04T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

Kennedy. The National Institutes of Health have quietly initiated a study of cancer deaths among populations near nuclear power plants, according to a letter released today by Senator Edward M. Kennedy. The letter, which was sent to the Massachusetts Democrat from Dr. James B. Wyngaarden, director of the institutes, said the studies were started as a result of ''leukemia clusters around the Pilgrim power plant in Massachusetts and several plants in the United Kingdom.'' The findings ''have led us to initiate a large-scale evaluation of cancer deaths occurring among persons living near the over 100 reactors operating in the United States,'' said Dr. Wyngaarden. Most experts in radiation have said that the level of radioactivity near nuclear power plants is too low to be a health hazard. Collaboration With Swedes Don Ralbovsky, a spokesman for the institutes, said the letter was sent on Jan. 28. He added that Dr. Wyngaarden was out of town and others who could comment on it were not reachable. In the letter, Dr. Wyngaarden also said the institutes were collaborating in a Swedish study of 40,000 patients who have received low doses of iodine-131 for medical diagnostic reasons. Iodine-131 is described as ''one of the major radioactive isotopes emitted during nuclear power plant operations and from nuclear weapons testing.'' ''We have also evaluated descriptive mortality data regarding possible cancer risks in the general population living downwind of the Nevada nuclear test site,'' the letter said. ''While many reported associations are unsupported by these data, a small increase in leukemia in southwest Utah cannot be ruled out at this time.'' A site in Nevada has been used for years for underground testing of nuclear weapons. The letter said the institutes have ''confirmed that leukemia was increased above expectation'' among military personnel who participated in at least one nuclear weapon test series. Dr. Wyngaarden said results of the studies are expected within a year. Three Mile Island Effects Dr. Wyngaarden also said the most serious health effect of the nuclear power plant accident at Three Mile Island, Pa., ''is mental stress to those living near the plant.'' He said the March 28, 1979, accident exposed the 36,000 people living within five miles of the plant to an average dose of two to eight millirems, ''or approximately what might be received from natural background radiation within one or two weeks.'' The Three Mile Island facility, in Middletown, Pa., is owned by General Public Utilities Corporation. In a reply to Dr. Wyngaarden's letter, Senator Kennedy said he believes the Nuclear Regulatory Commission should delay reopening the Pilgrim plant ''until this study is available.'' Pilgrim, owned by Boston Edison, has been closed since April 1986 because of problems with equipment and management.

O'Leary culminated her six-day visit to China today by presiding over the signing of several important contracts and accords for the American power-generation industry. Among them was an agreement allowing the Westinghouse Electric Corporation to sell steam turbine and generating equipment to the Qinshan Nuclear Power Station in central China. The Westinghouse agreement marks the first time since 1989 that an American company has been allowed to sell high-technology components for a Chinese nuclear-power plant. The military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square in June 1989 prompted the United States to impose sanctions that froze transfers of high technology to China. An earlier American law in 1985 prohibited sales of nuclear-power- plant technology to China unless the President certified that China was not helping other countries develop nuclear weapons. The law was passed because China was believed to be helping Pakistan with a nuclear-weapons program. Today's Westinghouse agreement required a special waiver from the Clinton Administration, said Robert R. Norhaus, the Energy Department's general counsel. The waiver essentially ""grandfathered"" the Westinghouse contract as predating the Tiananmen sanctions. It also limits Westinghouse to supplying generators, turbines and other equipment that serve the nonnuclear functions of the Chinese plant. Referring to Westinghouse and other American companies that would like to supply such components to China's fast-growing nuclear-power industry, Ms. O'Leary said: ""I would prefer to see our equipment sell. Given the likelihood that the United States may require this technology in 20 to 30 years, we would like that industry to stay healthy. One of the obvious markets for that industry is China."" Nathaniel D. Woodson, a Westinghouse executive who has been seeking markets for the company's nuclear-generating systems since 1983, said, ""I believe it is the first contract of any consequence with one of the nuclear plants in China."" Texaco Inc., which is seeking to expand its coal-gasification plant sales to China, also signed a contract to retrofit nine existing fertilizer plants in China with its environmentally clean gasification technology. China is studying whether it can afford to apply Texaco's ""clean coal"" process to electrical power production. Ms. O'Leary said her visit had helped to secure or identify $4.6 billion in potential business for American companies while increasing cooperation in energy development and pollution control with Beijing. China is facing increasing energy shortages as its demand for electrical energy is outrunning supply by more than 20 percent. COMPANY NEWS",1995-02-25T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business

In an action likely to prove largely symbolic, the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission today recommended granting a full-power operating license for the Shoreham nuclear power plant on Long Island. In a hearing at N.R.C. headquarters, the staff formally reported that the plant had satisfied all Federal safety requirements and was ''operationally ready.'' Long Island's geography, highway system and other features do not ''render emergency planning at Shoreham fundamentally more difficult than at other sites,'' the staff said. The commission's chairman, Lando W. Zech Jr., said the commissioners would announce their final decision on the license within a few days. Important Precedent Seen In a rare appearance before the commission, Dr. William J. Catacosinos, chairman of the Long Island Lighting Company, also asked that the $5.5 billion plant receive a license, even though there is little chance that Shoreham will ever use it. He argued that the license would set an important precedent, affirming the principle that nuclear energy policy is the prerogative of the Federal Government and that state and local governments do not have veto power over the establishment of nuclear plants. Under a plan formulated by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, Lilco's board of directors has agreed to sell the plant to the state for $1 in exchange for annual customer rate increases of 5 percent and other measures meant to insure financial stability. After the sale, New York would decommission Shoreham and Lilco would write off the loss on its Federal taxes. Lilco's stockholders are to vote on the plan in June. If the plant has a license and if for any reason the agreement is derailed, Dr. Catacosinos said, ''We will operate Shoreham.'' Two Decades of Work Lilco began building Shoreham more than 20 years ago. After many delays and over-budget expenses, the plant was finally completed in 1985. Opponents of nuclear power pursued multiple strategies aimed at preventing the plant from opening. The most potent was based on a Nuclear Regulatory Commision rule revision, made after the 1979 nuclear power accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. The revision calls for state and local authorities to participate in emergency evacuation planning. Suffolk County and New York State officials refused to participate in emergency planning for Shoreham and contended that the reactor, under the revised rules, had failed Federal licensing requirements. In response, Lilco developed its own emergency plan, one that could be used with or without state and county participation. ''It was never contemplated,'' Dr. Catacosinos said today, ''that the rule would be used to prevent a plant from operating.'' Unless that interpretation is decisively rejected through the granting of a license to Shoreham, he added, nuclear plants around the country could begin closing as state and local governments, under pressure from opponents, withdraw their cooperation. Evacuation Objections Rejected New York and Suffolk officials have explained their refusal to work with Lilco by arguing that Long Island's geography, highway system and population concentration combine to render infeasible any emergency plan in the event of an accident at Shoreham. Speaking on behalf of the N.R.C. staff, Thomas Murley, director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, today rejected that view. Shoreham's location, he said, ''compares favorably'' with those of other nuclear plants around the country. Long Island, he said, is a ''flat coastal plain without complex terrain'' and has major roads heading east-west and north-south, and the population density near the plant is ''less than for several other nuclear power plants.'' 'No Need to Evacuate' Even in the most serious emergency, Mr. Murley said, there would be ''no need to evacuate the island, and we should not.'' Instead Federal regulations call for moving people to beyond a 10-mile radius from the plant. Long Island is 118 miles long and 15 miles wide at Shoreham. Victor Stello Jr., the nuclear commission's executive director for operations, called Shoreham ''one of the most thoroughly reviewed and evalued plants'' in the country. Dr. Catacosinos said that while Lilco's board would recommend that the utility's 130,000 shareholders approve the Cuomo plan, he could not guarantee that they would do so. ''The saga is not over,'' he said.",1989-04-18T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

The Government turned down requests today to increase power at nuclear power plants on Long Island and in New Hampshire. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission rejected applications by the operators of the Shoreham nuclear power plant on Long Island and the Seabrook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire to operate the plants at partial power. Lando W. Zech Jr., the commission's chairman, said the Long Island Lighting Company's petition to operate Shoreham at 25 percent of its capacity over the summer was denied only because Lilco applied too late for the commission to undertake the inspections and other procedures necessary to insure safe operation. Mr. Zech said the commission did not consider opponents' arguments that the area around the plant could not be safely evacuated in an emergency. Political Motivation Charged Seabrook's application for a license to test the reactor at 5 percent of capacity was rejected, Mr. Zech said, because the emergency evacuation plan submitted to the commission by the plant's owners ''was simply deficient.'' In rejecting the two applications on technical grounds, the commission did not address the key issue of whether nuclear power plants can open despite state and local opposition. Opponents of the plants applauded the decisions but suggested that the commission might have been motivated more by concern for its image than for public safety. The commission's independence and neutrality have come under attack by Congressional critics who say it has favored the nuclear industry. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, a Shoreham opponent, said he thought the commission's decisions today were politically motivated. ''With all the heat and attention on them they ran for cover and made the right decision for the wrong reasons,'' he said. Representative George J. Hochbrueckner, the Suffolk County Democrat whose district includes Shoreham, agreed and said that the decisions show ''there were a lot of people putting a lot of pressure on the N.R.C. not to open the plants and I like to think they've started listening.'' Lilco Is Disappointed Mr. Zech denied that public pressure played any part in the agency's decisions. He said Seabrook's owners could submit a better evacuation plan for consideration and that Shoreham's owners could petition for increased capacity at an early date next year. Shoreham has held a license to test its reactor at up to 5 percent of capacity since July 1985. Jim Lois, a spokesman for Lilco, called today's decisions ''a disappointment'' and said one result was likely to be power shortages on Long Island this summer. ''We're adding 1,400 new customers every month and have been for 10 years,'' Mr. Lois said, ''yet in all that time we haven't added one watt of additional capacity.'' The petition to boost power to 25 percent of Shoreham's capacity would have permitted the plant to produce commercial levels of electricity for the first time since the $4.6 billion plant was completed three years ago. Mr. Lois said Lilco would probably renew the request early next year if Shoreham is not operating at full power by that time. Evacuation Plan at Issue New York State and Suffolk County officials have refused to participate in emergency planning for Shoreham, arguing that in the event of an accident at the plant it would be impossible to evacuate the surrounding area. Officials in Massachusetts have similarly refused to take part in emergency planning for Seabrook, which is near the Massachusetts-New Hampshire border. The nuclear commission is considering a proposal to give the Federal Government full authority to approve emergency evacuation plans over local opposition. Shoreham opponents have also argued that the cost of electricity on Long Island would increase dramatically if the commission gives Lilco permission to put Shoreham into commercial operation, even at a fraction of full capacity. Opponents of Seabrook, which has so far cost nearly $5 billion, argue that if that plant receives a testing license it will become contaminated by radiation and any possibility of converting it to a non-nuclear power plant will be lost. In a related development, the General Accounting Office, the invesitgative arm of Congress, concluded in a report released this week that the Government does not know how people living near operating nuclear power plants would react in the event of an emergency. The report noted that while the Federal Emergency Management Agency periodically conducts surveys to insure that people living near plants have received basic emergency planning information, the agency has never conducted a study that would reveal how many of them had read or understood that information.",1987-06-12T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.
27e06185-ba21-4aa8-8f94-fe25e9c8d6c4,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/science/29threat.html,When All Isn’t Enough to Stop a Catastrophe,"WASHINGTON — American nuclear safety regulators, using a complex mathematical technique, determined that the simultaneous failure of both emergency shutdown systems that are designed to prevent a core meltdown was so unlikely that it would happen once every 17,000 years. But 20 years ago, it happened twice in four days at a pair of nuclear reactors in southern New Jersey. The American people, and the regulators whose job it is to protect them from a catastrophic nuclear accident, are watching the unfolding events at a complex of crippled reactors in Japan with foreboding and an overriding question: Can it happen here? The answer — probably not — from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is meant to reassure. But as the New Jersey accidents in 1983, which did not result in any core damage or release of radiation, show, no one can predict what might upend all the computer models, emergency planning and backup systems designed to eliminate those narrow theoretical probabilities or mitigate their effects. “We can never say that that could never happen here,” said Anthony R. Pietrangelo, senior vice president and chief nuclear officer at the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry’s main trade association. “It doesn’t matter how you get there, whether it’s a hurricane, whether it’s a tsunami, whether it’s a seismic event, whether it’s a terrorist attack, whether it’s a cyberattack, whether it’s operator error, or some other failure in the plant — it doesn’t matter. We have to be prepared to deal with those events.” The threats considered most serious by nuclear engineers are problems that lead to a loss of power. Lack of power to run cooling systems for the reactor core and for spent-fuel ponds led to the explosions and release of radiation at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex in Japan. American nuclear facilities have backup power systems, and backups to those. All plants are required to have batteries to provide power in the event of a loss of power and failure of backup generators. In the United States, 93 of the 104 operating reactors have batteries capable of providing power for four hours; the other 11 have eight-hour batteries. Fukushima had eight-hour batteries. It wasn’t enough. No single analysis can discern which nuclear power plants in the United States are most at risk for a disaster, But the probabilities of an accident leading to damage to a reactor core have been roughly penciled out. A 2003 Nuclear Regulatory Commission report , based on data submitted by plant owners, looked at the risk of equipment breakdowns, power failures and other factors that could lead to core damage. It found that reactor No. 1 at Three Mile Island, near Harrisburg, Pa., would appear to be at greatest risk. (Three Mile Island is, of course, the plant that suffered a partial core meltdown in reactor No. 2 in 1979, the worst accident so far in the commercial nuclear power industry in the United States) By the commission’s calculations, such an episode would occur there roughly once every 2,227 years. By contrast, the expected frequency of a core damage accident at the Quad Cities facility in Illinois is once every 833,000 years. “These sorts of big numbers can tell you which plants need to take steps first to fix general problems, or which plants might have wider margins if a problem were to occur,” said David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer and the director of the Nuclear Safety Project of the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental and nuclear watchdog group. “They’re not going to tell you when that bad day is going to arrive.” Regulators and federal courts have discounted the likelihood of multiple crises hitting a nuclear facility at the same time. One federal judge, ruling against opponents of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant near San Luis Obispo, Calif., said that the odds of an earthquake setting off a nuclear accident at the plant were negligible. “The commission has determined that the chance of such a bizarre concatenation of events occurring is extremely small,” the court said. But the crisis at Fukushima shows that such natural catastrophes can occur. The fact that the odds of a nuclear accident are unknowable and the risks hard to measure make it in some ways more frightening than the known — and greater — risks of driving without a seat belt or breathing the fumes from a coal-burning power plant. “People are scared of certain things. It’s part of our makeup,” said Robert H. Socolow, a physicist at Princeton University. “The public is more afraid of radiation than the experts who work with it every day. But this is about irreducible irrationality, if you like. We are irrational, every last one of us.” Fresh Eye on American Plants In the wake of the disaster in Japan, concerns were quickly raised at the Turkey Point nuclear power plant in Florida, on Biscayne Bay 24 miles south of Miami. Critics pointed to the potential for a hurricane to create a storm surge that could simultaneously sever grid power and inundate backup generators — precisely the recipe that crippled Fukushima. In 1992, Turkey Point took a direct hit from Hurricane Andrew, causing a loss of off-site power for more than five days. Backup systems, however, allowed operators to keep the reactors cool until power could be restored. Paul Gunter, the director of the Reactor Oversight Project for the group Beyond Nuclear, which opposes nuclear energy, joined other critics in pointing to the Dresden nuclear facility in Morris, Ill., and the nearby Quad Cities plant in Cordova, both of which are north of the New Madrid seismic zone. The area registered quakes estimated to have exceeded 7.0 in magnitude in 1811 and 1812, and is known for somewhat more regular temblors of lesser intensity. Exelon, the operator of both facilities, said that all of its plants are designed to withstand substantial earthquakes, but argued that none — including Dresden and Quad Cities, which are hundreds of miles from the New Madrid fault line — are actually considered to be in significant earthquake zones. Still, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced last week that it would be conducting new seismic risk assessments next year at 17 plants — including Dresden. The Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant is not on the commission’s list. The plant, on an 85-foot bluff above the Pacific Ocean, is owned by Pacific Gas & Electric, about halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Opponents of that plant redoubled their efforts when PG&E began seeking early renewal on its two 40-year licenses — chiefly on the ground that the seismic studies that underwrote the original licensing in the 1970s were inadequate, and are now sorely out of date. A fault line discovered in 2008, called the Shoreline Fault, runs about half a mile from the front door of Diablo Canyon. Opponents want new seismic studies before the plant’s license is renewed, but PG&E, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other experts argue that the fault poses no threat that the nuclear facility couldn’t handle. As at Diablo Canyon, fears of an earthquake near the Indian Point nuclear power facility, about 30 miles north of New York City, were stoked in 2008 when researchers at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University discovered a pattern of small but active faults in the area, suggesting that earthquakes near the plant were more common than once thought. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York has called a special meeting with federal regulators to discuss earthquake risks and preparedness at the facility. Among the concerns: how to execute an orderly evacuation of one of the most densely populated regions of the country — particularly given that the government mandates that officials plan only for a 10-mile escape radius. How Risk Is Calculated As part of its mission to ensure the safety of nuclear power, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sets two goals: that the public’s risk of death from acute radiation sickness from nuclear reactors should not exceed one-thousandth of the risk of accidental death from all sources, and that the risk of fatal cancer likewise should not exceed that amount. The commission, looking at how much radiation it would take to kill people in accidents, and how much it would take to raise cancer rates, decided that reactors would meet that standard if there were meltdowns with off-site consequences only once per 100,000 years of operation. With 104 American reactors now running, that would mean such an event once every 1,000 years or so. The commission asserts that all plants currently meet that safety standard, according to an analysis that looks at the chance that any piece of equipment will fail, and what other failures that might lead to, under a mathematical method called probabilistic risk assessment, Martin A. Stutzke, the commission’s senior technical adviser for probabilistic risk assessment technologies, said in an interview. To meet the government’s goal, about 80 percent of the plants have made changes since the early 1990s, industry experts say. Many of the changes were to cope with new calculations of earthquake frequency and intensity. But while the safety goal of once in 100,000 years expresses a real number, the component failure numbers are yardsticks that may be wrong. “The numbers have tremendous uncertainty with them,” he said. They could be off by a factor of 10, he said. Earthquakes are a challenge, Mr. Stutzke said, because the historical record is so short. The Richter scale is 75 years old. For earlier records, he said, experts study old newspaper accounts — “church bells ringing, chimneys knocked over, this sort of thing,” he said. Geologists also use carbon dating and other techniques to estimate the time and scale of older earthquakes. The inherent problem, risk experts say, is that it is hard to determine the size of the worst natural hazard, said Douglas E. True, of ERIN Engineering and Research in Walnut Creek, Calif. American reactors may be better protected than those at the Japanese plant were, because of precautions taken after Sept. 11 for a terrorist or military attack, according to industry and government officials and academic experts. American nuclear plant operators are required to have diesel fuel and pumps on site or readily available nearby to provide backup power and cooling capacity. Right after the Fukushima crisis they were ordered to check that they had the required equipment on hand and in working order. The details are classified, but the industry has emergency supplies of pumps, hoses and generators, and the plan assumes Air Force help in moving equipment when needed. “We have military capability that’s pretty impressive, a transport system that can move big pieces of equipment very quickly,” said Dale Klein, a commission chairman in the second Bush administration. If the diesel generators fail, he said, it makes no difference whether the cause was attack, tsunami or earthquake; the remedy is the same. Another former chairman, Richard Meserve, who was in that position at the time of the 2001 attacks, said, “The challenge that we confront is that external events obviously can occur that may be larger than you expected.” The commission will not discuss the precautions it has in place to contend with such events, citing security considerations. Alternatives Carry Risks Too There is no simple or single way to properly weigh the risks of nuclear power against other energy sources, or other risks of modern life, said David Ropeik, an instructor at Harvard University, consultant to industry and author of “ How Risky Is It, Really? Why Our Fears Don’t Always Match the Facts .” “What we’re afraid of determines how we behave, and sometimes those behaviors become risks in themselves,” he said. He cited a study by two researchers at the University of Michigan who found that fear of flying after the Sept. 11 hijackings had caused an additional 1,018 highway deaths in just the first three months after the attacks. Radiation is a real threat, nuclear physicists say, but not as great as many people believe it is, and not as great as other threats. Indeed, every energy source comes with dangers, from the mine or wellhead to the smokestack or tailpipe. “One million people a year die prematurely in China from air pollution from energy and industrial sectors,” said Stefan Hirschberg, head of safety analysis at the Paul Scherrer Institute, an engineering research center in Switzerland. More than 10,000 Americans a year die prematurely from the health effects of breathing emissions from coal-burning power plants, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Coal mining accidents in China kill an estimated 6,000 people a year, according to China’s Mining Ministry. In just the past year in the United States, the Deepwater Horizon blowout killed 11 people, the Upper Big Branch coal mine blast killed 29 and a natural gas pipeline explosion in California killed 8. But such statistics don’t alter the public’s view of nuclear accidents. Michael A. Levi, senior fellow for energy and the environment at the Council on Foreign Relations, said there is no right way to gauge risk. It is an intensely personal matter affected by a lot of factors. “When you hear these arguments that pollution from coal plants costs so many thousands of lives compared to minimal or no deaths from nuclear accidents, that may be technically true, but it leaves a lot of people cold. It’s like saying, ‘Don’t pay attention to the twin towers falling; more people die crossing the street,’ ” he said. “Experts should not say, ‘Here’s how you should feel about risk.’ They should be saying, ‘Here are the facts. You decide what matters to you.’ ” A 2006 study of survivors of the 1986 Chernobyl accident, compiled by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the World Bank and a number of United Nations bodies, found that the biggest health impact was psychological. “The mental health impact of Chernobyl is the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident to date,” according to the report, “Chernobyl’s Legacy: Health, Environmental and Socio-Economic Impacts.” “Psychological distress arising from the accident and its aftermath has had a profound impact on individual and community behavior,” including a sense of fatalism and dependency that has been transferred to the next generation in the affected zone. “There is no question we should be appropriately concerned about nuclear power,” Mr. Ropeik said. “But ‘appropriately’ is the important distinction. On a continuum, there is no question in my mind that the dangers from fossil fuel burning should worry us more.”",2011-03-28T20:27:51.000+02:00,NYTIMES,science-science

The nuclear power plants that reliably supply 20 percent of the nation’s electricity are the most secure and best protected industrial facilities in the country, and I disagree with suggestions to the contrary. This includes the ridiculous claim that a laborer with information on “perimeter security” could easily cause a reactor meltdown. A nuclear power plant’s strong physical construction, redundant safety systems and multilayered protective strategies provide both a strong deterrent and a strong defense against potential threats. An array of independent experts, including former military, Federal Bureau of Investigation and security officials, has attested to the formidable security at nuclear energy facilities. They recognize that since 2001 nuclear power plant owners have spent in excess of $2 billion on security enhancements that include a 60 percent increase, to 8,000 total officers, in the size of the industry’s armed, paramilitary security forces, and substantial physical improvements to provide additional protection against vehicle bombs and other potential terrorist assaults.

Faced with an exhausted national treasury and rejections by foreign banks, Argentina is on the verge of halting construction of its third nuclear power plant. Dr. Emma Perez Ferreira, president of the National Atomic Energy Commission, said that $750 million in financing was needed by the end of June if work was to continue on the half-finished power plant, called Atucha 2. She said there was almost no likelihood of finding the money in the foreseeable future and that plans were being made for an orderly shutdown. Argentina's nuclear program, the most advanced in Latin America and one of those not under international safeguards, is aimed at developing a complete nuclear cycle. In addition to peaceful uses of nuclear power, that would give the country the ability to construct an atomic bomb. It already has the technology to enrich uranium in a plant at Pilcaniyeu, but is not believed to be enriching it at present to the 90 percent level needed to make fuel for nuclear explosives. U.S. Pressure Resisted President Raul Alfonsin says Argentina has no intention of building nuclear weapons, but his Government, like the military regime that preceded it, has resisted pressure from the United States and others to sign a nuclear nonproliferation treaty and submit to international inspections. The crisis over continued financing for Atucha 2 is only one, although the most serious, of a series of problems that have hampered the nuclear program for more than a year. Both of the existing power plants, Atucha 1 and Embalse, were taken out of service in mid-1987 and are expected to be started up again only this month. Authorities said they were originally halted for normal maintenance, but that when the first attempt was made to re-start Atucha 1 in October, some pipes broke, causing the spillage of a large quantity of heavy water, the relatively rare form of water containing heavy hydrogen that is used in some nuclear reactors. There has been no known danger from the incident, but it caused an additional operating delay. This week, the Government, citing power shortages caused in part by the shutdown of the nuclear plants, ordered rotating electricity cutoffs in Buenos Aires and other areas. The two plants provide about 15 percent of Argentina's electricity. Most of the nuclear program's other problems are linked to the shortage of financing. Argentina is burdened by a $54 billion foreign debt on which it cannot pay all the interest, a sharp decline in export income over recent years, an opposition-controlled labor movement restive over falling real wages, and public resistance to higher taxes. 'Postpone Everything' ''It's not that there has been a conscious decision to postpone nuclear development,'' Dr. Perez Ferreira said, ''but that the Government has to postpone everything - teachers' raises, social welfare, pensions and more.'' Dr. Perez Ferreira, a nuclear physicist who retired from the energy commission in 1980 and was brought back as its president last year when the budget crisis erupted, said the commission is now in a position to continue operating all its existing installations and probably complete work on a reprocessing plant for spent nuclear fuel, another part of the bomb cycle. But she said that the two big projects, Atucha 2 and a heavy-water plant at Arroyito in the province of Neuquen, had very uncertain futures. The heavy-water plant, nearly 90 percent finished, would require about $150 million to put it into operation. She said the budget might allow completion of that over the next few years but that it was questionable whether there was a market for the heavy water if Atucha 2 were not finished as well. This crisis comes at a time when one of the major concerns about the Argentine nuclear program - that rivalry with neighboring Brazil might lead one or both to build a bomb - has become less significant. Although Brazil recently developed the technology for uranium enrichment as well, the return of civilian governments in the two countries has led them to put aside some of their traditional mistrust.",1988-04-23T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

Yet the article did not note that, while pro- and anti-nuclear forces alike are highly critical of the commission today, their reasons are diametrically opposed. Nuclear advocates accuse the commission of ''regulating nuclear power to death'' and urge it to reduce the regulatory burden on the industry. Nuclear opponents argue that the commission's problem is too little regulation. The current N.R.C. routinely fails to enforce its own regulations and is also in the process of rewriting many requirements to accommodate the industry's demands. Advocates and opponents disagree on another key point as well. The nuclear industry and its captive utilities believe the commission can and should ''improve'' its performance by stabilizing the regulatory climate in order to usher in a ''second nuclear age.'' The anti-nuclear community finds the inability of the N.R.C. to regulate nuclear power plants adequately as simply one more reason that the nuclear endeavor should be phased out as quickly as possible.

While Germany intends to phase out nuclear power, and France’s new president, François Hollande, says he hopes to reduce his country’s reliance on it, the British government appears to be moving in the opposite direction with its proposals, which are intended to attract $175 billion in investment to build new reactors and renewable energy plants. The 27-member European Union sets climate change targets and coordinates efforts to reduce energy dependency, but decisions on energy sources remain with national governments. Britain’s proposals, announced in draft legislation by the Department of Energy and Climate Change, appear to be calculated to sidestep European Union restrictions on government aid that might prevent direct subsidies for the construction of nuclear power plants. Instead, they would guarantee prices for low-carbon electricity and pay producers for backup supplies when renewable sources like wind power fail to meet demand. Britain hopes that this guaranteed price, to be paid by businesses and consumers, will secure the financial commitment from energy utilities to construct nuclear reactors and clean-power projects needed to meet European targets and reduce Britain’s reliance on natural gas plants. Recent developments suggest that it could be a tough battle. In March, Britain’s nuclear program suffered a serious setback when two German companies, RWE and E.On, announced they would not proceed with a £15 billion, or roughly $24 billion, joint venture in Gloucester, blaming the economic crisis and arguing that the German government’s plan to phase out nuclear power had put additional pressure on their balance sheets. To add to the difficulties, the main architect of Britain’s energy policy, Chris Huhne, quit the government in February to fight charges stemming from a speeding offense in 2003. His successor, Edward Davey, said Tuesday that the new plans were in the national interest and would support as many as 250,000 jobs. “By reforming the market, we can ensure security of supply for the long term, reduce the volatility of energy bills by reducing our reliance on imported gas and oil, and meet our climate change goals by largely decarbonizing the power sector during the 2030s,” Mr. Davey said in a statement. The proposals have intensified debate over the cost and safety of nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster in Japan and the decisions by Germany and by Switzerland, which is not in the European Union, to phase out nuclear reactors. During the recent presidential election campaign, Mr. Hollande suggested reducing France’s dependence on nuclear power to around 50 percent from 75 percent and shutting 24 of the country’s 58 reactors by 2025. Critics attacked Britain’s determination to renew its nuclear capacity. “This proposal has distorted policy in order to try to disguise the massive subsidies nuclear will need, but they remain so huge that the policy will fail anyway,” said Tom Burke, a former environmental campaigner and visiting professor at Imperial and University Colleges, London. Industry reaction was far from euphoric. In a statement, Volker Beckers, chief executive of Npower, RWE’s British operation, said the required investment would amount to around £8,000, about $12,600, for every household in Britain. “I remain concerned by the amount of change being implemented in the energy sector and the time it is taking,” Mr. Beckers said. “I applaud government’s appetite for reform, but pulling so many levers at once in such a complex area risks losing sight of your original objectives. What the energy sector needs now is simplicity and clarity.”",2012-05-23T06:17:09.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-europe

cdf4be64-caf7-5e92-8f97-109f03711a26,https://www.tipsproject.eu/tips/,Loan Program May Stir Nuclear Industry,"WASHINGTON  When experts on power grid reliability asked themselves recently how a cleaner energy future would look, seven of eight regional councils imagined how their systems would work with 10 percent wind power. Only one, representing the southeastern United States, chose a radically different option: doubling nuclear power capacity. Thirty years after the American nuclear industry abandoned scores of half-built plants because of soaring costs and operating problems like the Three Mile Island accident , skepticism persists over whether the technology is worth investing in. Yet the pendulum may be swinging back. The 104 plants now running have sharply raised their output, emboldening utilities across the country to make a case for building new ones. And the industry is about to get a big boost. In the next few days, the Energy Department plans to announce the first of $18.5 billion in loan guarantees for building new reactors. The guarantees were authorized in a bill passed by Congress in 2005. It has taken four years for the department to set up a system to evaluate applications and determine how much the borrowers will be charged for the guarantees to compensate the government for taking the risk. Industry experts think the first guarantee will go to the Southern Company to build two units at its Vogtle nuclear plant near Augusta, Ga. The money will flow amid a national credit squeeze and intense jockeying among the nation’s wind, solar, geothermal and nuclear sectors. Each is trying to cast itself as an ideal “clean” energy option as the nation moves toward reining in the carbon dioxide emissions linked to global warming. All of these sources could potentially benefit under a cap-and-trade system that is being considered in Congress as part of climate change legislation. Such a system would set a ceiling on carbon dioxide emissions and allow trading of pollution permits, handicapping the carbon-intensive coal and natural gas sectors. Historically Republicans have been more enthusiastic than Democrats about nuclear power. So as the climate bill winds its way through the Senate, some Democratic members are seeking to add to the $18.5 billion in loan guarantees for the nuclear industry to attract Republicans and some industrial-state Democrats. (The House version passed in June, 219 to 212.) Some of the foremost Congressional climate change campaigners are unenthusiastic. Representative Edward Markey , a Massachusetts Democrat who has hounded the nuclear industry for decades over safety questions and who is a sponsor of the House bill, does not favor direct aid to the nuclear industry. He argues that a cap-and-trade system would give the nuclear sector the only boost it deserves. If that system goes into effect, he said, nuclear power “will be able to compete more effectively in a new marketplace. How effectively they can compete is going to be the question.” Others see combining a cap-and-trade system with a nuclear aid package as a sensible tactic to get Congress to address environmental problems. “One can argue it certainly is bringing about an unusual marriage of interests here,” said Philip R. Sharp, an Indiana Democrat who served in the House of Representatives from 1975 to 1995 and led a House committee with jurisdiction over the electric system. “It is one of the potential paths for actually getting real action and real legislation,” said Mr. Sharp, who now heads the nonpartisan group Resources for the Future. Economic issues have helped scramble alliances on the state and local level, too. Because new reactors create so many jobs and big tax revenue, the Democratic governors of Maryland and Ohio are working hard to get them built in their states. State legislatures from Louisiana to South Dakota and local governments from Port Gibson, Miss., to Oswego, N.Y., are also on record favoring new reactors. Peter A. Bradford, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission who is now vice chairman of the Union of Concerned Scientists, questions the wisdom of direct aid to the industry. Unlike cap and trade, in which industries buy and sell the right to release carbon dioxide in a market-oriented system, he said, the loan guarantees finance projects that the private sector deems too risky. The government would be “picking some winners and bestowing a lot of taxpayer support on them,” he said. By Mr. Bradford’s count, of 28 reactors that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission now lists as planned , half have had major delays, large increases in estimated cost or have been canceled. If new plants built with government guarantees prove to be a commercial success, the program costs taxpayers nothing; if they prove too expensive to finish or are completed but cannot earn enough to repay the loans, the taxpayer is on the hook. Complicating the challenge, the forthcoming loan guarantees amount to only $18.5 billion, and the nuclear industry says it needs tens of billions more. President Obama’s energy secretary, Steven Chu, acknowledged that the sum was small. He said it could finance at most perhaps one plant for each new reactor design, making it hard to determine which design was most practical. “If I were a power company, maybe one of each would not be helpful,” he said. He suggested that the nuclear industry would need to build two or three of each. But Dr. Chu insists that nuclear power will be an important piece of any climate solution. “We have a dormant nuclear industry,” he said. “We have to start it up in a way that gives the people who are going to make investments the confidence that this is economically viable.” Mindful of the challenges posed by global warming, some environmentalists are cautiously evaluating their positions on nuclear power. “There is an increasing number of people who have spent their lives as environmental advocates who believe that carbon is such an urgent problem that they have to rethink their skepticism about nuclear power,” said Jonathan Lash, the president of the World Resources Institute , who puts himself in that category. “But there are many people who are passionate environmentalists who are also passionate opponents of nuclear power, and remain so,” he said. Among the foes is Karen Hadden, executive director of the Sustainable Energy and Economic Development Coalition in Austin, Tex., which is fighting a nuclear project there that is in line for a loan guarantee. While she strongly favors carbon limits, she said, she opposes construction of reactors. She warned that money for solar, wind and geothermal projects could get siphoned off “in these multibillion-dollar projects that may or may not ever get built.” Daniel L. Roderick, senior vice president for nuclear plant projects at GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy, a partnership between General Electric and Hitachi of Japan, said that a year and a half ago, there were expectations that more than 20 units would be under construction by now in the United States. “That number is currently zero,” he said. Nonetheless, G.E. and other companies have invested tens of millions of dollars in plans for reactors they hope to build around the world, including dozens in the United States.",2009-12-23T23:55:17.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business

Agency Says","Image Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in Kyiv on Thursday. Credit... Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The Ukrainian employees who operate a Russian-occupied nuclear power plant on the war’s front lines are facing “unacceptable pressure” to sign employment contracts with a Russian state-owned company, the head of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog said on Friday. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been under the control of the Russian nuclear operator, Rosatom, since March. But Ukrainian staff have continued working there — many of them by force, Ukraine says — even as a battle for control of the area has raged. Russian shelling has occasionally cut the facility off from the power grid that is used to cool its reactors, raising fears of a nuclear accident. Russia said last week that it planned to nationalize the plant, the largest in Europe. But Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in response that the agency still viewed the plant as a Ukrainian facility because the U.N. charter does not recognize illegal annexations. Zaporizhzhia is one of the four regions that President Vladimir V. Putin illegally declared part of Russia in recent weeks. The agency said in a statement on Friday that the Russian nuclear power operator, Rosatom, had been pressuring Ukrainian employees at the plant to sign an employment contract as a condition for keeping their jobs, and that Ukraine’s nuclear operator has urged them not to. Mr. Grossi traveled to Russia and Ukraine this week for talks about establishing a safety zone around the plant. The statement said that he had discussed the “increasingly difficult and challenging work conditions” at the plant during his meetings with Russian and Ukrainian officials. “I made clear that the staff must be allowed to carry out their vital tasks without undue interference or pressure,” Mr. Grossi said, according to the statement. Neither Rosatom nor the Ukrainian operator, Energoatom, could be reached for comment early Saturday. In a Facebook post on Friday, Energoatom praised the plant’s employees for maintaining the plant’s security despite Russian pressure. On a few occasions this year, Russian shelling has forced the Zaporizhzhia plant to rely on diesel generators to power safety equipment. The availability of fuel to power those generators has long been a concern. When external power was restored to the plant last weekend, nearly two days after Russian shelling had forced it offline, Mr. Grossi called the development “temporary relief in a still untenable situation.”",2022-10-15T10:23:25.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Credit... Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Power has again been restored at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility, reducing worries about an accident at one of the war’s most sensitive sites. But the head of the United Nations’ atomic watchdog warned that Ukrainian workers were under yet more intense pressure as Moscow tries to assert further control of the plant. While Ukrainian engineers have continued to operate the plant under the watch of Russian soldiers, Moscow recently said it was nationalizing the facility. The effort is part of a broader bid to claim, in a parade of formalities designed to give the moves a sheen of legitimacy, that parts of Ukraine are now Russian. The nuclear plant sits in one of four Ukrainian provinces that President Vladimir V. Putin declared this month had been annexed to Russia — a move that has been widely rejected and condemned as illegal. Late Friday, Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in a statement that employees at the nuclear plant were now facing “unacceptable pressure” to sign employment contracts with the Russian nuclear energy company, Rosatom, in defiance of Kyiv. That pressure only adds to the stresses on the workers that Ukrainian officials have been warning about for months, saying that Russian soldiers had subjected already fatigued staff to harsh interrogations and torture. Holding the plant gives Moscow a military advantage but also significant leverage over Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, and Russian authorities could also, in theory, connect the facility to its own grid, funneling power south to Ukrainian territory that it has seized. Amid the continuing management struggle between Moscow and Kyiv, Ukraine’s nuclear power company said this week that Russia had kidnapped another senior official from the plant, expressing fears he could be forced to disclose information about Ukrainian personnel working there. The head of the plant had previously been detained and released. Ukraine’s state energy company, Energoatom, said on the Telegram messaging app on Saturday that it had set up a hotline for workers at the plant that could be used by “everyone who has information about cases of kidnapping and torture” by Russian authorities. Despite Russia’s claims to have nationalized the plant, the International Atomic Energy Agency says that it views the plant as Ukrainian, since the U.N. charter does not recognize illegal annexations. In a “much needed development,” the Ukrainian engineers who have been working at the Zaporizhzhia site under intense Russian pressure had managed to restore backup power, ending the plant’s reliance on diesel generators. Most nuclear power plants consider diesel generators a last line of defense to be used only in extreme circumstances. It was the second time in recent days that shelling had cut power lines that feed the cooling systems for the plant’s six reactors, all of which are shut down. The war marks the first time that a nuclear facility has become an active battle zone. Russia has stationed troops and artillery at the plant since seizing it in March. Ukrainian authorities say the Russians have shelled nearby cities from the plant’s grounds, aware of the risk of returning fire. A waste storage site has been hit several times, and power lines have been a frequent target. Each side has blamed the other for the attacks. “Working in very challenging conditions, operating staff at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant are doing everything they can to bolster its fragile off-site power situation,” Mr. Grossi said. “Restoring the backup power connection is a positive step in this regard, even though the overall nuclear safety and security situation remains precarious.” The Zaporizhzhia plant is not providing electricity to Ukraine’s grid, given that its reactors are shut down, but it needs its own power source for safety reasons. Workers have been wrestling for weeks with how to provide that. Mr. Grossi said that efforts to restart one of the reactors for that purpose would begin on Saturday in a process that would take several days. In addition, more diesel fuel has arrived, from both the Ukrainian and Russian side of the front line, to power Zaporizhzhia’s generators for at least 10 days should the plant again be cut off, he said.",2022-10-15T15:30:26.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Don’t Blame the Greens.,"But the economy snapped back — thanks to government stimulus programs — far faster than anticipated. And so, too, did demand for energy. But this industry does not ramp up quickly. So, there was not enough natural gas, let alone renewables, to fill in the gap. America has enough oil and natural gas to meet its own needs for now, but its ability to export liquefied natural gas to help others is limited, especially when every utility in Europe and Asia is trying to meet newly minted environmental, social and governance standards for clean energy and therefore is desperate to import natural gas. When every country jumps in at once, the price goes crazy. Or the lights go out. Don’t get me wrong. I am as green as ever. But I’m not a nice green. I am a mean green. Achieving the scale of clean energy that we need requires not only wind, solar and hydro, but also a carbon tax in every major industrial economy, nuclear power and natural gas as a bridge. If you oppose all those, you’re not serious about what scientists tell us needs to be done right now — put in place enough non-carbon-emitting fuels to manage the destructive aspects of climate change that have become unavoidable, so we can avoid those that would be unmanageable. Sadly, in an overreaction to the Fukushima nuclear accident, Germany decided in 2011 to phase out all of its nuclear power by 2022 — nuclear power stations that in the year 2000 generated 29.5 percent of Germany’s power generation mix. All of that has to be replaced by wind, solar, hydro and natural gas, and there is just not enough now. As Bill Gates points out in his smart book “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,” the only way to reach our climate targets is to shift production of all the big heavy industries, like steel, cement and automobiles, as well as how we heat our homes and power our cars, to electricity generated from clean energy. Safe and affordable nuclear power has to be part of our mix because, Gates argues, “it is the only carbon-free, scalable energy source that’s available 24 hours a day.” Meanwhile, though, this energy crisis is coinciding with the stalemate in the talks between the U.S. and Iran about restoring the nuclear deal that Donald Trump recklessly tore up in 2018 — without any alternative plan to curb Iran’s nuclear program. To pressure us, Iran has resumed enriching uranium to levels such that U.S. officials now believe it could be only a few months, or less, away from having enough fissile material for a single bomb. It would take much longer for Iran to build a warhead and delivery system, but some U.S. officials believe that Iran just wants to make itself a threshold nuclear power, like Japan, where it would stay just a few turns of the screw away from actually having a bomb. This would give it all the deterrence it needs. Both Israel and America have vowed not to let Iran get that close to the doorstep of a nuclear weapon. Alas, we are entering crunchtime.",2021-10-06T17:45:47.000+02:00,NYTIMES,globalhome

Muammar el-Qaddafi has opened Libya's previously secret nuclear facilities, the world is learning just how much of the machinery for making bomb fuel he had been able to assemble without international detection. Over a period of many years, Libya tapped into an international underground market for specialized steel tubes and uranium enrichment centrifuges that has been scandalously easy to gain entry to and shockingly difficult to close down. Even the newly strengthened provisions of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty cannot guarantee that other countries will not attempt similar end runs. And they may not follow Libya's lead and abruptly come clean before they begin producing nuclear bombs. A far more stringent and enforceable set of controls on nuclear equipment exports is urgently needed. The treaty loophole that several countries have exploited to begin a nuclear weapons program under the guise of civilian power generation must be closed. That route must be blocked by prohibiting uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing outside countries with well-established and carefully monitored nuclear technology industries. Libya began its nuclear activities with a civilian power program in the 1970's, then secretly added a weapons element in the 1980's. Over the next two decades, it seems to have clandestinely acquired the equipment needed for enriching uranium into bomb fuel component by component, whenever willing sellers could be located. Iraq also started its pre-Persian Gulf war nuclear weapons program under the guise of nuclear power development. Iran now claims, unconvincingly, that its newly uncovered uranium enrichment facilities are meant to provide power reactor fuel. North Korea has not bothered pretending. When its uranium enrichment and plutonium separation plants were found, it simply quit the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and declared it was building nuclear weapons. That still leaves most of the world adhering to the treaty, except India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea. But the essentially voluntary inspections required under its original provisions are clearly inadequate. A tougher, more intrusive inspection system was added in the 1990's, but so far, less than half of the treaty's participants have signed up for it and less than a fifth have ratified it. Iran and Libya have now agreed to submit to intrusive inspections. But these work only when regulators are tipped off to problems. In Iran, the tip came from an opposition group; in Libya, it came from Colonel Qaddafi. To supplement this imperfect system, strong new measures are needed to crack down on exporters of the kind of equipment Libya secretly purchased. That will require imposing stiff penalties on governments found to allow such exports, even if the exporters are private companies operating outside the law. Governments are more likely to police rogue exporters if they know they themselves will be penalized. The nuclear power loophole must also be closed. If a country is legally allowed to develop the means to produce bomb-grade uranium through a variant of the enrichment process used to make reactor fuel and can extract bomb-grade plutonium from reactor byproducts, it can build nuclear weapons whenever it likes. There is no legitimate reason for countries to develop such capacities if they can be sure of reliable outside fuel supplies. Reactor fuel production should be limited to the few advanced countries that already have fully transparent nuclear technology industries. Other countries should have a guaranteed right to purchase all the reactor fuel they need, provided they accept intrusive inspections and return nuclear byproducts. These steps will greatly decrease the risk of nasty nuclear surprises like those delivered by Iran and Libya. They should be taken without delay.

Can we build safe nuclear plants? The answer to both is yes! The world’s energy needs are growing. By midcentury the world’s population is expected to be nine billion, nearly 30 percent more than today’s. More important, the push by developing countries to increase their standard of living is inexorably tied to a corresponding increase in energy consumption. World electricity consumption by midcentury will probably be between two and four times what it is today. And our aging power plants will have to be replaced before then. This enormous demand for new generating capacity must be met while also containing global warming and minimizing pollution and other environmental damage. But how? Solar and wind energy are nowhere near ready to take on this kind of load. Coal, oil and gas are polluters and major carbon dioxide generators — hence major contributors to global warming. Oil and gas also have geopolitical issues. Nuclear power is the only major electricity source that is both ready and does not contribute to global warming. There is no question that nuclear plants must be built with the highest regard to safety. Modern nuclear plant designs therefore incorporate greatly enhanced safety features that, for example, allow a reactor to shut down and cool itself by natural forces like gravity and natural circulation, without external electrical power. Fukushima could not happen in these plants. We need all the electricity sources we can get. Let’s not exclude clean and safe nuclear energy. ZVI J.

The official, Gennadi A. Veretennikov, was one of six who lost their party cards or received reprimands. They were accused of negligence in running the Chernobyl plant. A fire and release of radioactivity in the station's No. 4 reactor during the night from April 25 to 26 has resulted in about 30 dead and led to the evacuation of more than 100,000 people from an area of about 300 square miles. The latest penalties, announced in Pravda, the party daily, brought to 12 the number of top officials who have been dismissed from their jobs or otherwise penalized. Party reprimands and, all the more, the loss of party membership are serious impediments to Soviet career advancement. Mr. Veretennikov, a former economic planner, was a Deputy Minister of the Electric Power Ministry, where he headed the nuclear division, known by the acronym Soyuzatomenergo. Last month the ruling Politburo announced that nuclear power management had been removed from the Power Ministry and had been set up as a separate Ministry of Nuclear Energy. Its head is Nikolai F. Lukonin, former manager of nuclear plants near Leningrad and in Lithuania. Another official listed by Pravda as having lost his party card is Y. V. Kulikov, head of an unidentified department in an agency known as the Ministry of Medium-Machine Building. That is a cover name for the production of fissionable materials and the manufacture of nuclear weapons. It was the second time that this agency has been named in the Chernobyl context. Last month its First Deputy Minister, Aleksandr G. Meshkov, was dismissed. The relationship between the military-oriented agency and the commercial Chernobyl plant has not been explained. Among four officials who were reprimanded was Aleksei N. Makukhin, a First Deputy Minister of Electric Power. He was accused of having failed to insure the reliability of the Chernobyl station. Mr. Makukhin was the Power Minister of the Ukraine for 11 years before his promotion to Moscow in 1982, and the Chernobyl station was built during his tenure. Another official to be reprimanded was Viktor A. Sidorenko, first deputy chairman of the nuclear safety agency, known by the Russian acronym Gosatomenergonadzor. The chairman, Yevgeny G. Kulov, was one of the officials dismissed last month. Party reprimands were also meted out to M. P. Alekseyev, a deputy chairman of the State Committee for Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, and Leren P. Mikhailov, director of the Power Ministry's turbine design institute. Pravda said Mr. Mikhailov was reprimanded for ''failing to insure proper supervision over the testing of a turbine generator'' that is said to have led to the Chernobyl accident.",1986-08-15T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world

The operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, said the contract worker, who was in his 60s, died after carrying heavy equipment in a waste disposal building of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. The company said that he was wearing radiation-protection clothing and a mask when he collapsed, and that his body did not show high levels of radioactive contamination. Japanese news media reports later quoted a doctor at the plant as saying the man had apparently suffered a heart attack. The death is the first by one of the workers struggling to bring the Fukushima Daiichi plant under control since it lost power and cooling functions after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. Contractors who work at nuclear power plants in Japan have traditionally labored in some of the most hazardous conditions, battling intense heat and braving radiation exposure to do such jobs as cleaning radioactive materials from surfaces in the plants. The waste disposal building the contract worker had been in has been used to store radiation-contaminated runoff taken from the plant’s damaged reactor buildings, where the water is obstructing workers’ efforts to bring the reactors under better control. On Saturday, nuclear officials said they had found more than 12 feet of water in the basement of Reactor No. 1. Another power company announced on Saturday that it had completed the shutdown of a nuclear plant elsewhere in Japan, honoring a request by the prime minister to suspend operations at the plant for safety reasons.

In an unrelated incident, the state-owned operator of the nuclear fuel retreatment plant at La Hague in northwestern France reported that five workers were irradiated in an accident at the plant Tuesday. Francois Cogne, head of the Institute for Nuclear Safety and Protection, said the workers received about two or three times the safe annual dose when pipework being closed down was found to have a much higher radiation content than expected. Mr. Cogne and Pierre Tanguy, nuclear safety inspector for the state-owned Electricite de France power monopoly, clarified details of the Bugey incident, which was reported today by the political-satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine. In the incident, systems failures led to an automatic reactor shutdown and loss of all normal electrical power to the reactor cooling pumps, while only one back-up diesel generator worked. Mr. Tanguy said the incident was caused by ''a minor fault and an operator error'' but also stemmed from basic design faults in the electrical system. But since then, all French nuclear plants of the Bugey type have been equipped with further gas turbine back-up power plants, and control room procedures have been changed, he said. Both officials said the Bugey incident was reported in 1984 in industry documents, but not noticed at the time by the general press. ---2 Contaminated in England SEASCALE, England, May 21 (AP) - Two workers sustained minor radioactive contamination while carrying out maintenance work at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant, officials said today.

The United States has urged Russia to drop the multibillion-dollar sale, asserting that it violates a 1992 agreement among nuclear suppliers and will hurt international efforts to stem the spread of nuclear weapons. The brewing dispute underscores East-West tension on nuclear issues, as Russia's nuclear energy establishment has turned to exports to try to plug a yawning budget gap. Western experts worry that Russian exports may undermine the bold promises of cooperation on nuclear issues made at a meeting last year between President Boris N. Yeltsin and Western leaders. Russia and the United States are already at odds over Moscow's decision to sell a nuclear reactor to Iran, which the United States insists has begun a determined effort to develop a nuclear weapon. Russia's desire to help Cuba complete construction on a nuclear power plant has also caused worries in Florida, which fears that the plant will be unsafe. Nor are nuclear exports the only worry. Moscow recently touched off a crisis by agreeing to sell an advanced S-300 anti-aircraft system to the Greek Cypriot Government. After Turkey threatened military action, the Clinton Administration began a furious round of diplomacy to soothe tensions in the area. But Russian nuclear officials are unrepentant about their drive for foreign sales and say the sale of power plants to India will not enhance its military potential. ''We must expand our exports,'' Viktor N. Mikhailov, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister, told reporters last month. ''We will use the export earnings to repay our debts.'' The roots of the Indian dispute go back to 1974, when New Delhi startled the world by conducting a nuclear test. The Indians used plutonium from a research rector sold by Canada for peaceful purposes. In an effort to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, nuclear suppliers agreed to a system of export controls, which were broadened in 1992. The 1992 ''suppliers' agreement'' forbids nuclear suppliers from exporting nuclear technology to aspiring nuclear powers. Specifically, it says that nuclear suppliers cannot sell nuclear technology to nations that are not formally recognized as nuclear weapons states and which do not allow international inspections of all of their key nuclear institutes, laboratories and plants and of the nuclear material there. Under the treaty against the spread of nuclear arms, only the United States, Russia, Britain, France and China are recognized as nuclear weapon states. ''The basic idea is that countries should not get the benefits of nuclear energy without making a comprehensive commitment to its peaceful use,'' an American official said. As a practical matter, the 1992 agreement imposed an embargo on sales of nuclear technology to India, Pakistan and Israel, which are believed to have developed nuclear weapons and have refused to sign the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons and accept international monitoring. South Asia has long been an area of special concern. India and Pakistan, both emerging nuclear powers, are bitter antagonists and have fought three wars since 1947. American diplomats have also been frustrated by India's opposition to a nuclear test ban. India says that it is not willing to accept a ban until the major nuclear powers agreed to a timetable for disarmament. But American officials say they believe that India's position is simply a rationale for keeping its nuclear option open. American officials became alarmed in 1995 when American spy satellites detected possible preparations for a nuclear test. As a nuclear exporter, Russia went along with the toughened controls over nuclear supplies. But after it signed the suppliers' agreement, economic pressures began to build. Racked by budget cuts and driven by a fervent commitment to nuclear energy, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister makes no qualms about the importance of the Indian deal and other foreign sales. The ministry received only 72 percent of its budget allotment last year and many of its nuclear power customers failed to pay up, forcing it to delay payment of wages to nuclear engineers and workers. In December, more than a dozen employees at a St. Petersburg nuclear power plant briefly seized the control room and threatened to shut down the plant until they were paid. The budget crunch was so severe that the ministry it turned to commercial banks for credit at interest rates as high as 70 percent a year. Mr. Mikhailov said his ministry is now saddled with a debt of about $285 million, and is looking toward exports to help repay its loans. Russia's nuclear exports exceeded $2 billion last year. Yevgeny A. Reshetnikov, a Deputy Minister of Russia's Atomic Energy Agency, declined to specify the exact value of the Indian deal. But he said in an interview that the value of the sale was $1.5 billion to $2 billion for each of the light-water reactors. The reactors are to be used as nuclear power plants in southern India and can produce one million kilowatts each. Light-water reactors use ordinary water to slow down the neutrons emitted by nuclear fission to the speed required to sustain the chain reaction. Russian and Indian officials hope to complete their talks this month, Mr. Reshetnikov said. The talks have been snagged by disputes over credits to be provided by the Russian Finance Ministry, and some American officials have expressed doubt that the deal will be consummated. But as Russian and Indian officials have moved to complete the agreement, the United States has made repeated, if quiet, protests. ''We have made demarches to the Russians objecting to this sale,'' a senior American official said. Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia arrived today for several days of talks with Vice President Al Gore. American officials have used such meetings in the past to press their concern over the Russian sale of a nuclear reactor to Iran and other security issues, but officials declined to say if the Indian sale would be discussed in the confidential, informal discussions among the leader or their top aides. Even as they acknowledge their economic motivation, Russian officials defend the sale. They argue that the reactors they sell will be subject to monitoring, unlike some key Indian nuclear research centers and plants, and thus will not directly contribute to India's military potential. Russian officials also insist that the sale should be exempt from the 1992 suppliers' agreement because it was included in an earlier understanding between Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the last Soviet President, and Indian leaders. The initial agreement to build the reactor was worked out in 1987, Mr. Reshetnikov said, though he conceded that much of the technology would be newer. Indian officials, for their part, say they greatly need nuclear plants because of their shortage of electric power and say Washington's arms- control policies reflect a colonialist double standard. But Washington insists that the sale is forbidden by the agreement and would be a setback for international efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. ''There are two basic problems,'' an American official said. ''One is the Indians. We worry about what the Indians will do with the reactors. We worry about the safety culture. Even a light-water reactor produces a fair amount of plutonium.'' The other problem, he asserted, is Russia's decision to breach the 1992 agreement by selling to an emerging nuclear power like India. ''The Russian Federation, as signatories to the 1992 suppliers' agreement, should not be selling these controlled nuclear technologies,'' he added. Other specialists say the Russian move is ill timed and appears to reward India at a time when it is being difficult on nuclear issues. ''It is an unfortunate time for Russia to be giving India a nuclear pat on the back,'' said Leonard S. Spector, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",1997-02-06T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,world

The Energy Department will pay the consortium $130 million to design a plant to make the fuel, but will not ask Congress for money to build the plant until progress is made in negotiations with Russia to dispose of their own weapons plutonium, department officials said today. President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin have agreed in principle that each side should dispose of 50 tons of plutonium, enough for thousands of bombs, either by using it as reactor fuel or mixing it with highly radioactive waste. The Energy Department is trying to do both. The plan, which faces opposition from some safety advocates, is to run the reactors on a mix of 33 percent to 40 percent plutonium and enriched uranium, which the plants were designed to use. The plants are: Catawba 1 and 2, near York, S.C., which are owned by several municipal electric companies and Duke; McGuire 1 and 2, near Huntersville, N.C., which are owned by Duke alone, and North Anna 1 and 2, owned by Virginia Electric and Power Company, near Mineral, Va. ''This is a swords-to-plowshares type program,'' Mike Tuckman, executive vice president of nuclear generation at Duke Power, said in a conference call with reporters. ''Quite frankly, I have difficulty understanding why anybody would be opposed to it.'' He said that Duke, owned by the Duke Energy Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., and Virginia Power, owned by Dominion Resources Inc., would save money on fuel by using the plutonium. But several nuclear experts are critical of the plans. The Nuclear Control Institute, an antiproliferation group based in Washington, argues that a plutonium core makes a nuclear accident slightly more likely. In addition, according to the group, moving plutonium into civilian reactors would create security problems, because the fuel would have to be guarded until it was loaded into the reactor, because it could be stolen and turned back into weapons fuel. The Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, a nonprofit group that studies the safety of manufacturing nuclear weapons, says the environmental record of some of the European partners is poor.",1999-03-23T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.
462bb69b-f7c6-5e5b-9591-810fca8bf44e,https://www.tipsproject.eu/tips/,"With Eye on Iran, Rivals Also Want Nuclear Power","Two years ago, the leaders of Saudi Arabia told international atomic regulators that they could foresee no need for the kingdom to develop nuclear power. Today, they are scrambling to hire atomic contractors, buy nuclear hardware and build support for a regional system of reactors. So, too, Turkey is preparing for its first atomic plant. And Egypt has announced plans to build one on its Mediterranean coast. In all, roughly a dozen states in the region have recently turned to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna for help in starting their own nuclear programs. While interest in nuclear energy is rising globally, it is unusually strong in the Middle East. “The rules have changed,” King Abdullah II of Jordan recently told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. “Everybody’s going for nuclear programs.” The Middle East states say they only want atomic power. Some probably do. But United States government and private analysts say they believe that the rush of activity is also intended to counter the threat of a nuclear Iran. By nature, the underlying technologies of nuclear power can make electricity or, with more effort, warheads, as nations have demonstrated over the decades by turning ostensibly civilian programs into sources of bomb fuel. Iran’s uneasy neighbors, analysts say, may be positioning themselves to do the same. “One danger of Iran going nuclear has always been that it might provoke others,” said Mark Fitzpatrick, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, an arms analysis group in London. “So when you see the development of nuclear power elsewhere in the region, it’s a cause for some concern.” Some analysts ask why Arab states in the Persian Gulf, which hold nearly half the world’s oil reserves, would want to shoulder the high costs and obligations of a temperamental form of energy. They reply that they must invest in the future, for the day when the flow of oil dries up. But with Shiite Iran increasingly ascendant in the region, Sunni countries have alluded to other motives. Officials from 21 governments in and around the Middle East warned at an Arab summit meeting in March that Iran’s drive for atomic technology could result in the beginning of “a grave and destructive nuclear arms race in the region.” In Washington, officials are seizing on such developments to build their case for stepping up pressure on Iran. President Bush has talked privately to experts on the Middle East about his fears of a “Sunni bomb,” and his concerns that countries in the Middle East may turn to the only nuclear-armed Sunni state, Pakistan, for help. “It’s a constant source of discussion,” a senior administration official said recently. “But it’s not something the president thinks he can discuss publicly” after the imbroglio over faulty weapons intelligence on Iraq. The Middle East has seen hints of a regional nuclear-arms race before. After Israel obtained its first weapon four decades ago, several countries took steps down the nuclear road. But many analysts say it is Iran’s atomic intransigence that has now prodded the Sunni powers into getting serious about hedging their bets and, like Iran, financing them with $65-a-barrel oil. “Now’s the time to worry,” said Geoffrey Kemp, a Middle East expert at the Nixon Center, a Washington policy institute. “The Iranians have to worry, too. The idea that they’ll emerge as the regional hegemon is silly. There will be a very serious counterreaction, certainly in conventional military buildups but also in examining the nuclear option.” No Arab country now has a power reactor, whose spent fuel can be mined for plutonium, one of the two favored materials  along with uranium  for making the cores of atom bombs. Some Arab states do, however, engage in civilian atomic research. Analysts caution that a chain reaction of nuclear emulation is not foreordained. States in the Middle East appear to be waiting to see which way Tehran’s nuclear standoff with the United Nations Security Council goes before committing themselves wholeheartedly to costly programs of atomic development. And even if Middle Eastern nations do obtain nuclear power, political alliances and arms-control agreements could still make individual states hesitate before crossing the line to obtain warheads. Many may eventually decide that the costs and risks outweigh the benefits  as South Korea, Taiwan, South Africa and Libya did after investing heavily in arms programs. But many diplomats and analysts say that the Sunni Arab governments are so anxious about Iran’s nuclear progress that they would even, grudgingly, support a United States military strike against Iran. “If push comes to shove, if the choice is between an Iranian nuclear bomb and a U.S. military strike, then the Arab gulf states have no choice but to quietly support the U.S.,” said Christian Koch, director of international studies at the Gulf Research Center, a private group in Dubai. Decades ago, it was Israel’s drive for nuclear arms that brought about the region’s first atomic jitters. Even some Israeli leaders found themselves “preaching caution because of the reaction,” said Avner Cohen, a senior fellow at the University of Maryland and the author of “Israel and the Bomb.” Egypt responded first. In 1960, after the disclosure of Israel’s work on a nuclear reactor, Cairo threatened to acquire atomic arms and sought its own reactor. Years of technical and political hurdles ultimately ended that plan. Iraq came next. But in June 1981, Israeli fighter jets bombed its reactor just days before engineers planned to install the radioactive core. The bombing ignited a global debate over how close Iraq had come to nuclear arms. It also prompted Iran, then fighting a war with Iraq, to embark on a covert response. Alireza Assar, a nuclear adviser to Iran’s Ministry of Defense who later defected, said he attended a secret meeting in 1987 at which the commander in chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said Iran had to do whatever was necessary to achieve victory. “We need to have all the technical requirements in our possession,” Dr. Assar recalled the commander as saying, even the means to “build a nuclear bomb.” In all, Iran toiled in secret for 18 years before its nuclear efforts were disclosed in 2003. Intelligence agencies and nuclear experts now estimate that Tehran is 2 to 10 years away from having the means to make a uranium-based bomb. It says its uranium enrichment work is entirely peaceful and meant only to fuel reactors. The International Atomic Energy Agency’s concerns peaked when inspectors found evidence of still-unexplained ties between Iran’s ostensibly peaceful program and its military, including work on high explosives, missiles and warheads. That combination, the inspectors said in early 2006, suggested a “military nuclear dimension.” Before such disclosures, few if any states in the Middle East attended the atomic agency’s meetings on nuclear power development. Now, roughly a dozen are doing so and drawing up atomic plans. The newly interested states include Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, Yemen and the seven sheikdoms of the United Arab Emirates  Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Al Fujayrah, Ras al Khaymah, Sharjah, and Umm al Qaywayn. “They generally ask what they need to do for the introduction of power,” said R. Ian Facer, a nuclear power engineer who works for the I.A.E.A. at its Vienna headquarters. The agency teaches the basics of nuclear energy. In exchange, states must undergo periodic inspections to make sure their civilian programs have no military spinoffs. Saudi Arabia, since reversing itself on reactors, has become a whirlwind of atomic interest. It recently invited President Vladimir V. Putin to become the first Russian head of state to visit the desert kingdom. He did so in February, offering a range of nuclear aid. Diplomats and analysts say Saudi Arabia leads the drive for nuclear power within the Gulf Cooperation Council, based in Riyadh. In addition to the Saudis, the council includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates  Washington’s closest Arab allies. Its member states hug the western shores of the Persian Gulf and control about 45 percent of the world’s oil reserves. Late last year, the council announced that it would embark on a nuclear energy program. Its officials have said they want to get it under way by 2009. “We will develop it openly,” Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, said of the council’s effort. “We want no bombs. All we want is a whole Middle East that is free from weapons of mass destruction,” an Arab reference to both Israel’s and Iran’s nuclear programs. In February, the council and the I.A.E.A. struck a deal to work together on a nuclear power plan for the Arab gulf states. Abdul Rahman ibn Hamad al-Attiya, the council’s secretary general, told reporters in March that the agency would provide technical expertise and that the council would hire a consulting firm to speed its nuclear deliberations. Already, Saudi officials are traveling regularly to Vienna, and I.A.E.A. officials to Riyadh, the Saudi capital. “It’s a natural right,” Mohamed ElBaradei, the atomic agency’s director general, said recently of the council’s energy plan, estimating that carrying it out might take up to 15 years. In all, 85 percent of the gulf states  all but Iraq  have declared their interest in nuclear power. By comparison, 15 percent of South American nations and 20 percent of African ones have done so. One factor in that exceptional level of interest is that the Persian Gulf states have the means. Typically, a large commercial reactor costs up to $4 billion. The six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council are estimated to be investing in nonnuclear projects valued at more than $1 trillion. Another factor is Iran. Its shores at some points are visible across the waters of the gulf  the Arabian Gulf to Arabs, the Persian Gulf to Iranians. The council wants “its own regional initiative to counter the possible threat from an aggressive neighbor armed with nuclear weapons,” said Nicole Stracke, an analyst at the Gulf Research Center. Its members, she added, “felt they could no longer lag behind Iran.” A similar technology push is under way in Turkey, where long-simmering plans for nuclear power have caught fire. Last year, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for three plants. “We want to benefit from nuclear energy as soon as possible,” he said. Turkey plans to put its first reactor near the Black Sea port of Sinop, and to start construction this year. Egypt, too, is moving forward. Last year, it announced plans for a reactor at El-Dabaa, about 60 miles west of Alexandria. “We do not start from a vacuum,” President Hosni Mubarak told the governing National Democracy Party’s annual conference. His remark was understated given Cairo’s decades of atomic research. Robert Joseph, a former under secretary of state for arms control and international security who is now Mr. Bush’s envoy on nuclear nonproliferation, visited Egypt earlier this year. According to officials briefed on the conversations, officials from the Ministry of Electricity indicated that if Egypt was confident that it could have a reliable supply of reactor fuel, it would have little desire to invest in the costly process of manufacturing its own nuclear fuel  the enterprise that experts fear could let Iran build a bomb. Other officials, especially those responsible for Egypt’s security, focused more on the possibility of further proliferation in the region if Iran succeeded in its effort to achieve a nuclear weapons capability. “I don’t know how much of it is real,” Mr. Joseph said of a potential arms race. “But it is becoming urgent for us to shape the future expansion of nuclear energy in a way that reduces the risks of proliferation, while meeting our energy and environmental goals.”",2007-04-15T06:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

In a speech to business executives in Nagoya on Tuesday, Mr. Koizumi surprised many in the solidly pro-nuclear audience by saying that Japan should rid itself of its atomic plants and switch to renewable energy sources like solar power. His remarks were reported in the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper on Wednesday. As a pro-growth prime minister from 2001 to 2006, Mr. Koizumi had backed the business lobby by calling for Japan to become “a nation built on nuclear power,” calling it cheap and clean, and sided with the Tokyo Electric Power Company in deciding to end tax-supported subsidies for solar panels. But he said in Tuesday’s speech that he had reversed his stance after the nuclear accident at Tepco’s Fukushima complex two and a half years ago, which left at least 83,000 people homeless and forced a multibillion-dollar cleanup that has been riddled with mistakes and accidents. “There is nothing more costly than nuclear power,” Mr. Koizumi, 71, was quoted as saying. “Japan should achieve zero nuclear plants and aim for a more sustainable society.” Mr. Koizumi spoke on the same day that his son and political successor, Shinjiro Koizumi, 32, was named to a top cabinet post overseeing the recovery of northeastern Japan from the triple disaster that struck in March 2011, when a devastating earthquake and tsunami set off meltdowns at three Fukushima reactors. Tuesday’s appeal was a rare return to public view by the retired prime minister, who rose to power with his uncanny ability to read the public zeitgeist and inspire voters with calls for radical change. Since retiring from politics four years ago, Mr. Koizumi has remained largely out of sight, refusing interviews or most requests to appear on television. In the last month, local media reported that Mr. Koizumi had begun saying in private that he now opposed nuclear power, but Tuesday’s speech, before a crowd of 2,500, was one of his first public statements. It is unclear how big a lift, if any, the proclamation will give Japan’s antinuclear movement, which appeared to crest last year when tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered weekly outside the prime minister’s residence. While public opinion polls still show that more than half of Japanese oppose restarting the nation’s idled nuclear plants, the protests have dwindled to a few dozen die-hards. Opposition to nuclear power also failed to become an election issue last December, when voters handed a landslide victory to the pro-nuclear Liberal Democratic Party. On Tuesday, Mr. Koizumi said that antinuclear sentiment remained a potentially potent political force beneath Japan’s deceptively placid surface. He called on the Liberal Democrats and the current prime minister, Shinzo Abe, Mr. Koizumi’s former political protégé, to tap that power in motivating the nation to overcome the Fukushima disaster. “If the Liberal Democratic Party were to adopt a policy of no nukes, the public mood would rise in an instant,” Mr. Koizumi was quoted as saying. “The Japanese are masters at turning a pinch into a new chance.”",2013-10-02T09:12:14.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific
c9969c59-85f2-48fc-b302-b22be0b55c72,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/us/seeking-nuclear-power-workers-of-tomorrow.html,Seeking Nuclear-Power Workers of Tomorrow,"PALACIOS — At first glance, the large, framed photo hanging on a wall at the state’s largest nuclear power plant seems to tell a simple story. About 200 smiling men and women stand in block formation behind a long-stretching banner — shades of a high school class portrait, though one posed in front of the domes of two nuclear reactors. “UNIT 1 COMMERCIAL OPERATION 25 YEARS — AUGUST 25, 1988,” the banner reads. The photo, snapped last summer, is a source of pride at the South Texas Project nuclear plant, about 90 miles southwest of Houston on 12,200 acres along the Colorado River. But for the plant’s officials, the photo encapsulates anxiety about who will work at the plant in the years ahead. Each worker in the photo helped build the plant and has kept it running, and the workers make up just a portion of those who will soon retire, taking along years of expertise. The owners must find a younger generation of specialists to keep the plant producing the power that lights two million homes. “It’s the thing that keeps me up at night,” said Dennis Koehl, chief executive and chief nuclear officer at the S.T.P. Nuclear Operating Company. The company’s 1,200 employees average more than 22 years of experience, and in the next few years, about 40 percent will be eligible for retirement. A shift in economics and public sentiment has stalled the state’s nuclear power sector, which not long ago was considered poised for growth. But as graying baby boomers prepare to hang up their Hazmat suits, officials are racing to find new talent, pouring millions of dollars into education programs in hopes of training new workers in an industry that produces about 12 percent of the state’s power. The plant is not alone. The situation is not much different at the state’s other nuclear power plant, Comanche Peak in North Texas, or at the 100 other reactors across the country. But industry representatives say a national educational network — largely an outgrowth of a model developed in Texas — has helped ease longstanding concerns about a labor shortage. Before 2011, energy specialists spoke of a nationwide “nuclear renaissance.” State lawmakers around the country considered measures to spur plant construction. And in 2010, President Obama promised $8.3 billion in loans for two planned Georgia reactors, further energizing nuclear advocates. In the mid-2000s, Texas considered adding as many as eight reactors. With big plans for expansion, the Texas A&M University System Board of Regents in 2007 approved the Nuclear Power Institute at College Station — a hub of statewide collaboration between high schools, community colleges and universities — to train the next generation of workers. “The next years will be an exciting time for nuclear power in Texas,” Kenneth L. Peddicord, the institute’s director, said at its unveiling. “We’re glad to be part of it.” (The Texas A&M University System is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.) But that boom never hit. S.T.P. is the only Texas company asking federal regulators to license a new reactor. But federal regulators have frozen review of all applications — S.T.P.’s included — as they address the waste storage issue that has plagued the industry. Mr. Koehl said that even if officials quickly resolved the issue, investors would be unlikely to finance a new reactor anytime soon. In a country awash in cheap natural gas, investors have largely frowned on building nuclear plants, which are far costlier. In addition, the industry is still reeling from the public relations nightmare caused by the meltdown of Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in 2011. Still, nuclear power officials in Texas and elsewhere say they need plenty of new labor as older workers step aside. Beginning in the early 2000s, the industry realized it faced a looming threat. Its work force was made up largely of those who built reactors in the 1970s and 1980s and transitioned into jobs running the plants. That population, infused with years of experience and knowledge, would not be around forever. “When we stopped building in the U.S., we stopped seeing massive numbers of new workers flock to the industry,” said Elizabeth McAndrew-Benavides, manager of strategic work force initiatives at the Nuclear Energy Institute in Washington. “It was a very large issue for us.” Not everyone is equipped to operate and maintain a reactor, or to monitor radiation levels inside a plant and on its own employees. Nuclear energy officials feared they would soon lack the manpower to operate the country’s current reactors as their licenses were renewed, let alone the new ones. “It’s at all levels, from the managers on down,” Mr. Koehl said of his company’s needs, adding that specialty engineers and people with other industry-tailored skills are particularly hard to find. That includes Jesse Wells, who has coordinated 18 of S.T.P.’s planned outages, the monthlong powering down of a reactor to refuel it and perform thousands of maintenance operations — a process that happens once every year and a half. Mr. Wells, who came to S.T.P. after spending years working with the Navy’s nuclear program and has stayed for three decades, is set to leave in May in what he calls the plant’s first wave of retirements. Mr. Wells, 57, said he was anxious about the move but only on a personal level. He had no doubts, he said, that someone capable would fill his job. Still, he put off postponing his initial retirement plans to work one last outage alongside his successor. Company officials have unleashed an aggressive plan to transfer knowledge within the company, and to educate students to fill voids left by retirement. The company, Matagorda County’s biggest employer, is mostly looking in its backyard. In the last six years, it has spent millions of dollars designing the curriculum at local high schools and community colleges and awarding scholarships to students in the area. Graduates of the two-year nuclear power technology degree program at Wharton County Junior College, for instance, can expect to earn starting salaries of $65,000 to $70,000 if plant officials, who closely monitor enrollment, offer them jobs. “We’re trying to homegrow as much as we can,” Mr. Koehl said. If S.T.P. grows more nuclear experts than the company needs, Mr. Koehl said, graduates are likely to find work elsewhere in the United States or in countries with much bigger ambitions for nuclear power. That is because the Matagorda County programs are plugged into the state’s Nuclear Power Institute, which has been a crucial stop for recruiters worldwide and helps track industry needs. Mr. Peddicord said the energy market shift has spurred the institute to look outside Texas, a change from its original focus on cultivating in-state talent. As the first state to develop such a consortium, Texas has served as a model for others, such as Georgia and South Carolina, where the country’s new large-scale reactors are under construction. That, Ms. McAndrew-Benavides said, has helped plants feel more confident about meeting their future needs. “Texas beat everybody to the punch,” she said. “You guys are absolutely ahead of the game.”",2014-01-12T01:55:28.000+01:00,NYTIMES,national-u.s.

He claims that they are not “growing anywhere near fast enough to replace fossil fuels.” Is he aware that wind power accounted for 28 percent of all new United States electric generating capacity from 2010 to 2014? Does he know that 40 percent of all new installed power capacity during the first half of 2015 came from utility-scale solar plants?

He said Russia and Ukraine “were engaging with us” over talks to end fighting at the nuclear plant. KYIV, Ukraine — The head of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog agency said on Monday that there were active negotiations with both Ukraine and Russia to end military actions in and around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. The nuclear complex in southern Ukraine — Europe’s largest — has been imperiled by frequent shelling, raising global fears of a nuclear catastrophe. “I have seen signs that they are interested in this agreement,” Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said at a news conference. While Mr. Grossi declined to go into details given the delicate diplomacy involved, he said he had witnessed “two sides that are engaging with us and are asking questions, lots of questions.” Mr. Grossi visited the plant last week with a team of inspectors from the agency, two of whom remained behind and will stay in place for the foreseeable future. The nuclear facility is occupied by Russian forces but is still being operated by Ukrainian engineers taking orders from Ukrainian energy officials. The International Atomic Energy Agency has called for the establishment of a “safety and security protection zone” around the facility, but it does not have the authority to order a cease-fire or to demand that Russian forces leave the plant. Mr. Grossi’s comments on Monday suggested that what is under discussion is something less than a demilitarized zone and perhaps more like an agreement to silence arms in and around the plant. Since the war began — and especially since shells started landing in and around the facility early last month — nuclear engineers working under great stress have been racing to address one crisis after another to prevent a nuclear accident. Ukraine and Russia have each blamed the other for the shelling. Mr. Grossi has refrained from specifying who is responsible. He said Monday that shelling had continued despite the presence of international inspectors, insisting that hostilities must end as they continue to pose a danger even after all six reactors at the plant have been shut down. Ukraine made the decision to take the Zaporizhzhia plant offline on Sunday — a step that the Biden administration has been urging Ukrainian authorities to take for weeks. But American officials have said the Ukrainians are reluctant to lose the vital source of energy. The plant, at full operation, provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity supply. And there is a fear that, once shut down, Russia might seek to find ways to connect it to Russia’s grid, instead of Ukraine’s. Mr. Grossi said that Ukrainian officials had made it clear that they considered the plant to be a vital part of their power grid and that engineers were currently working to repair the high-voltage cables that would ultimately allow it to be brought back online. While the decision to take the plant offline lowered the risks of a nuclear catastrophe, Mr. Grossi said that he remained gravely concerned about the plant’s tenuous connection to outside power, which it has lost at least twice in the past five weeks. Even with all the reactors now in a state known as “cold shut down,” essential equipment dedicated to cooling spent fuel rods needs a constant source of power. All four high-voltage lines connecting the plant to the Ukrainian power grid remain severed. A reserve line connected to a nearby thermal power plant is the only connection to outside power. “Even in cold shut down,” Mr. Grossi said, the plant still needs power “or there could be a nuclear accident.”",2022-09-12T21:25:04.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Under a 1974 treaty with the United States, the South agreed to refrain from using those technologies, which can be used to create fuel for nuclear power plants, but also to make nuclear weapons. They began talks a year ago to rewrite the treaty. South Korea wants the ban lifted, arguing that it desperately needs to reprocess its accumulating spent fuel from nuclear reactors to reduce its stored waste. It also wants to use reprocessing and enrichment to secure fuel supplies for its expanding nuclear power industry. The country aspires to meet 60 percent of its electricity needs with nuclear power by 2030 and become a global exporter of nuclear reactors. The United States supports a revised agreement that “will reflect the increased importance that the Republic of Korea is playing in the global nuclear energy arena,” the chief United States negotiator, Robert J. Einhorn, said Monday in Seoul, using South Korea’s formal name. His South Korean counterpart, Park Ro-byug, said the current agreement was drafted in the days when South Korea was what he called a “unilateral recipient” of American help in civil nuclear engineering. He said it was time for the two allies to create a “mutually beneficiary” treaty that acknowledges South Korea as a global player in peaceful uses of nuclear power. Behind such diplomatic talk lurk the two nation’s different views on uranium enrichment and reprocessing spent fuel. “The United States opposes the spread of enrichment and reprocessing even to South Korea, because it wants to set an absolute standard to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation,” said William Tobey, a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University. “While Seoul does not pose such a threat, a hard-and-fast standard will be the strongest bulwark against weapons proliferation by other states.” Song Min-soon, a former South Korean foreign minister who is now an opposition lawmaker, said the negotiations would “serve as an important test” of how the United States wants to be regarded by South Koreans. “If they pressure South Korea too much, it might spawn anti-American sentiment,” he said, along with what he characterized as “calls for a nuclear sovereignty.” North Korea has built its nuclear bombs with plutonium obtained by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel. Last week, it said it had also made rapid progress in uranium enrichment. “Any hope of curbing the North’s nuclear weapons program must entail like restrictions on the South,” Mr. Tobey said.",2011-12-07T03:06:09.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Under a preliminary agreement, power authority officials said the Entergy Corporation, which has won the nuclear industry's praise for its management of five plants in the South, would take over the Indian Point 3 plant in Buchanan and the James A. Fitzpatrick plant in Scriba under a five-year contract. Officials said details of the management contract, including how much Entergy would be paid and how many of the power authority's workers would be cut, remained to be determined, pending an analysis by Entergy of the operations at the two plants. The plan requires the approval of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. At a news conference, senior executives of the power authority said the private management proposal, untested anywhere else, was necessary because of both the poor performance at Fitzpatrick and Indian Point 3, and the heightened demands expected with deregulation of the electrical utility industry. ''This alliance will help to create and save jobs in New York State by lowering the cost of electricity,'' said C. D. Rappleyea, the power authority's chairman. But analysts responded to the plan yesterday with mixed reviews, saying it was a step toward resuscitating two nuclear plants that rank among the country's worst, as measured by safety and efficiency, but a step that may not be go far enough. The most troubled of the plants is Indian Point 3, which was included in June by Federal regulators on a ''watch list'' of the nation's worst nuclear plants. That came less than three months after the plant reopened after a 29-month overhaul, and prompted calls by citizen groups that it be closed. Although Fitzpatrick has performed better during the last two years, it too was included on the Federal Government's list of problem plants and taken out of service in 1992 and 1993. On Wall Street, Michael Worms, a utility industry analyst for CS First Boston, said the management agreement with Entergy ''looks like a good fit all around.'' Citing the company's strong track record at nuclear plants in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, he said, ''There is no reason to assume that they are not up to the job'' of turning around the New York State plants. But others said the New York power agency may simply be postponing the inevitable closing of plants that cannot compete with less costly, non-nuclear electrical power production. ''Even if major improvements are made at these two plants, they probably can't compete,'' said Ashok Gupta, an economist with the National Resources Defense Council. The plan provoked protests from some who have been advocating for years that the Indian Point 3 plant, 35 miles north of New York City, be closed. ''How many times do you have to see that a plant is a failure before you stop pumping in public subsidies?'' asked Richard Brodsky, a Democratic State Assemblyman from Westchester County and chairman of the Assembly's Committee on Environmental Conservation. Although New York State legislators hold no direct oversight over the power authority, he said he would call for a legislative hearing to try to find ways of blocking the contract with Entergy. Senior executives of the power authority acknowledged yesterday that Entergy will face challenges in making improvements at the two plants, particularly because of moves toward deregulation within the electrical utility industry that have already begun to realign customers and their power suppliers. In New York State, which has been a leader in utility industry deregulation, the state's public service commission ruled in May that electrical customers must be given complete choice over whom they buy their power from by early 1998. That means customers can select from utilities across the state or elsewhere in the country. Although the state power authority's two nuclear plants have contracts to sell all their power to New York City, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and other government entities, as well as businesses receiving state power subsidies, they could soon be underbid by other utilities and lose business as industry deregulation takes hold. ''Being average won't be good enough in the new world of competition,'' said Robert G. Shoenberger, president of the New York Power Authority.",1996-08-01T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

A Federal appeals court ruled today that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission must set up training requirements for workers at nuclear power plants instead of relying on utilties to conform voluntarily with the commission's training guidelines. The three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that the commmission circumvented a 1983 amendment in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act when it issued a policy statement in 1985 that encouraged, but did not compel, nuclear plant operators to create training programs. The commission had concluded that the best way to get nuclear power plants to improve training was to create a model training code and urge the utilities to comply voluntarily. The commission ended up endorsing industry-written training procedures. Public Citizen, a group founded by the consumer advocate Ralph Nader, filed lawsuits in 1986 and 1988 challenging the commission's approach. But the commission, looking at the issue again in 1988, decided not to impose requirements, relying on language in the 1983 amendment that allows the agency to issue ''appropriate regulatory guidance.'' Ruling against that position today, the court held that the term ''regulatory guidance'' was ambiguous but that other language mandating the instructional requirements was clear.",1990-04-18T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

France, with 56 reactors, produces more than half the total. A fleet of up to 13 new-generation nuclear reactors planned in France, using a different design from the one in Flamanville, wouldn’t be ready until at least 2035 — too late to make a difference in the current energy crunch. Across the channel, Britain recently announced ambitions for as many as eight new nuclear plants, but the reality is more sobering. Five of the six existing British reactors are expected to be retired within a decade because of age, while only one new nuclear station, a long-delayed, French-led giant costing 20 billion pounds at Hinkley Point in southwest England, is under construction. Its first part is expected to come online in 2026. Others being considered in Eastern Europe aren’t expected to come online before 2030. “Nuclear is going to take so long” because the projects require at least 10 years for completion, said Jonathan Stern, a senior research fellow at the independent Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. “The big problem is getting off Russian gas, and that problem is now — not in a decade, when maybe we’ve built another generation of nuclear reactors,” he added. Advocates say nuclear power can be a solution if the political will is there. Belgium’s government, in agreement with the country’s Green party, reversed a decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2025 and extended the life of two reactors for another decade as Russia intensified its assault on Ukraine last month.

He spoke as the United Nations Security Council considered imposing new sanctions on Iran because of its refusal to halt uranium enrichment activities. “We have been promised that we will have nuclear power this time next year in our power grid,” the ISNA news agency quoted him as saying in a speech in Bushehr, the southern city where Iran is building its first nuclear power plant. A senior official speaking in Tehran gave reporters more precise information and said the Bushehr plant was expected to be operational in October. The official, Ahmad Fayazbakhsh, managing director of the Production and Development of Nuclear Energy Company, said the date for the plant’s electricity to join the national power grid would be announced after the commissioning, the official IRNA news agency reported. Russia is helping Iran to build the plant and made the eighth and final delivery of its nuclear fuel this week. However, the leader of the Russian company building the plant, the state-run Atomstroyexport, has said the plant will not be operational until the end of 2008, Reuters reported. Mr. Fayazbakhsh also said Iran was building a 360-megawatt nuclear power plant in Darkhovein, in the southern Khuzestan Province, without help from any foreign contractors. IRNA quoted him as saying that the plant was expected to become operational in 2017, adding that it was still in the stage of “basic planning,” which would continue until October 2010. Some Western countries and Israel have accused Iran of having a clandestine nuclear weapons program under the guise of a civilian nuclear program. Iran contends that its program is for peaceful purposes and will produce fuel for its nuclear plants. In his speech, Mr. Ahmadinejad renewed his attack on Israel and warned Western nations to stop supporting it. “I warn you to abandon the filthy Zionist entity, which has reached the end of the line,” he said. “It has lost its reason to be and will sooner or later fall,” he said. “The ones who still support the criminal Zionists should know that the occupiers’ days are numbered,” he said, adding that the countries that support Israel share responsibility in crimes against Palestinians.",2008-01-31T07:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-middle-east

The deal is a lifeline for the Japanese nuclear power industry, which has been foundering since meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in northeastern Japan in 2011. Plans to build a dozen new reactors in Japan were canceled after that, a gut punch for some of the country’s biggest industrial conglomerates, including Toshiba and Hitachi. With the domestic market moribund, Japanese companies had been pursuing deals abroad, but success was elusive. The economic case for nuclear energy has weakened as a result of low oil and gas prices, prompting utilities and governments around the world to rethink construction. The Fukushima disaster increased safety concerns. And Japanese vendors have had to fight lower-cost rivals from places like Russia and South Korea for a shrinking number of customers. India looks like a rare opportunity. It is planning 20 new reactors over the next decade or so, and as many as 55 more have been proposed. Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, and Narendra Modi, his Indian counterpart, are hoping that trade can underpin a broader strategic relationship, aimed in part at fending off China. The nuclear deal has nonetheless drawn criticism in Japan. India possesses atomic weapons and has kept itself outside the international legal framework against proliferation. Because of that, many in Japan, which was hit by two nuclear bombs in World War II, would prefer not to establish ties with nuclear power. Left-leaning Japanese newspapers have published editorials against the Indian deal, and the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the bombed cities, have issued pleas to stop it. Formal negotiations by the two governments lasted six years. Other countries have already begun allowing nuclear-related exports to India, including the United States, which signed a similar accord a decade ago. “There was a huge outcry when the government first said it would pursue this” in 2010, said Masaaki Fukunaga, a professor at the Center for South Asian Studies at Gifu Women’s University in Gifu, Japan, who has followed the issue closely. “The industry and the government were determined.” Mr. Abe said Japan had reserved the right to stop nuclear exports if India conducted another nuclear weapons test. “There is a legal framework to ensure India’s responsible and peaceful use of technology,” he said. Japanese leaders say they are looking to support more than just the nuclear industry. National economic growth may be at stake. As Japan has become less competitive in sectors like consumer electronics, big industrial projects are being counted on to fill the gap. In addition to the nuclear accord signed on Friday, Mr. Abe and Mr. Modi agreed to explore plans to build additional high-speed rail lines in India based on Japan’s Shinkansen bullet-train technology. Construction on a previously agreed line from Mumbai to Ahmedabad will begin in 2023, the leaders said. Japan will help finance the project with low-interest loans. Japan’s push to become a global infrastructure powerhouse has had setbacks. Vietnam’s legislature scrapped plans in 2010 for a Shinkansen train line, citing costs, and is reportedly close to canceling plans for a proposed Japanese-built nuclear power station. Indonesia chose a Chinese group’s bid last year to build a high-speed rail line over a Japanese bid that had been considered the favorite. South Korea underbid Japan to win a contract to build the first nuclear reactors in the United Arab Emirates. And Tokyo Electric Power, owner of the ruined power station in Fukushima, pulled out of a bid to build and run a nuclear power station in Turkey. A Japanese-French consortium ultimately won the Turkish contract in 2013, after a strong diplomatic push from Mr. Abe, but it remains the only successful Japanese nuclear-plant sale since the Fukushima accident. The bet on India is no sure thing. Nuclear plants can take decades to plan and build, and proposals to develop them are vulnerable to political and economic shifts. The Indian government must find new locations for some proposed plants because of local protests. And even for countries that have already signed nuclear trade agreements with India, little actual business has materialized so far, in part because of an Indian law that opens hardware vendors to potentially unlimited liability claims in the case of accidents. India has been working with the United States and other countries to create a framework for minimizing vendors’ liability risk, including the creation of a domestic accident compensation fund. Officials hope to complete it next year. If that hurdle can be overcome, the first Japanese company to benefit from the agreement with India will most likely be Toshiba, whose American subsidiary Westinghouse has won conditional approval to build six reactors in India. Westinghouse uses components from Japan, including reactor-containment vessels built in Japanese steelworks, so the deal signed on Friday is essential to moving forward. Toshiba needs the boost. It acquired Westinghouse in 2006 for $5.4 billion, a princely investment upon which it was struggling to earn a return, even before Fukushima. Investigators examining a $1.2 billion accounting scandal at Toshiba last year concluded that managers had inflated revenue figures at the company in large part to cover up the poor financial state of its nuclear power business.",2016-11-11T16:13:27.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-international-business

The Greens, who joined Mr. Jospin's Government in 1997, have always insisted that the nuclear energy issue is at the center of their policy concerns. But even though the Green leader, Dominique Voynet, serves as Environment Minister, the party says it is being ignored on vital questions inside the coalition. The issue at hand is the coming debate on energy policy. Its central question is whether France will reduce its dependence on nuclear energy and turn to other sources. France's 57 nuclear reactors provide 78 percent of the country's energy, one of the highest rates in the world. But as those plants become obsolete in the coming years, France will face the choice of phasing them out or replacing them with a new type, the so-called European Pressurized Reactors. Those reactors, developed in a French-German project, are expected to be ready to go into operation around 2010. The anti-nuclear campaign planned in France may cause some turbulence, but even if the Greens walk out, their departure is not likely to threaten the fate of the Government coalition, which thanks to its Communist allies would still retain a majority in Parliament. As Greens have elsewhere in Europe, those in France have strongly opposed nuclear energy, and they say a straight replacement plan is not acceptable. They insist that they cannot compromise on the point, which they see as a cornerstone of the agreement they reached with Mr. Jospin's Socialists before joining the coalition Government. ''It's a very fundamental question for us,'' said Denis Baupin, the Green Party spokesman. ''Do we replace the decommissioned plants with new ones, or do we start to opt out of nuclear energy, like Belgium and Germany? If the decision is for new plants, we will pull out of the Government.'' The Greens have also renewed their demand that a national referendum be held on the country's energy strategy and the future of nuclear power. To make sure they will be heard, the Greens say they are planning a series of protests against nuclear power, matching the campaign of Germany's Greens, who have been pressing the Government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder to phase out nuclear energy use more quickly. The French environmentalists see the experience of their German counterparts as a warning sign. German Greens have become angry and frustrated as Mr. Schroder's promised effort to shut down nuclear power plants has stalled after pressure from business leaders. Officials say an informal consensus is forming that France will reduce, though not eliminate, its nuclear power plants. They say that if anti-nuclear pressure heats up, the Government can afford to postpone any key decisions until after the presidential election of 2002 -- for which the Socialists want to keep the Greens as allies. But the tension over the issue underscores the rising influence of the Green movement. After long seeming indifferent to environmental questions, France is now among the European countries where Greens have gained support and moved from the political fringes closer to the center of power. As their neighbors fared better, France's Greens long remained marginal in political life because of infighting and splits over ideology. Their position improved after Mrs. Voynet took charge in 1993. Among other changes, she allied the Greens with the Socialists. But unexpected success came in the European parliamentary elections in June, when the vote for the Greens surged to close to 10 percent from less than 3 percent in the last European election, in 1994. In the Paris area alone, the Greens scored almost 20 percent. The increases have prompted them to fight for greater influence in future local elections. In the meantime, to their annoyance, their new popularity has not translated automatically into more political power. Mrs. Voynet and other party members have openly said that their 10 percent vote should have earned them more seats in the Cabinet than the one they now have. Party leaders also sound clearly frustrated that they have not gained greater say over policy decisions.",1999-08-30T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has yet to require the utility industry to install the same security against terrorist bombings that is provided members of Congress at the Capitol, a House subcommittee was told today. Members of the five-member Nuclear Regulatory Commission told the Investigations Subcommittee of the House Interior Committee that the condition existed despite occasional threats broadcast by international terrorist groups against American nuclear power plants. They said that one reason for the ageny's decision not to order the installation was the cost to utility companies. The security in question involves vehicle barriers that could be quickly raised hydraulically. They would be installed at the gates of nuclear power plants. Their cost to utility companies was estimated at about $200,000 by Representative Sam Gejdenson, the subcommittee chairman. Vote Was 3-2 Against Them ''That is one ten-thousandth of the value of such a plant,'' the Connecticut Democrat declared. Since the attack on the United States Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983 by a terrorist driving a truck with a huge bomb, the retractable vehicle barriers, which can be raised by guards from below-ground vaults, have been installed outside the Capitol and at the driveways of many other Government buildings here. Federal security regulations require them at nuclear reactors making weapons-grade radioactive materials, but the Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted 3 to 2 in 1986 to exempt commercial electric power reactors from installing the vehicle barriers. That decision is under reconsideration now, commission witnesses told the subcommittee today. But Robert F. Burnett, the commission director of safeguards, said the agency ''does not assume'' that a vehicle entering a nuclear power plant contains a terrorist bomb. Because of what the witnesses called ''the robust construction'' of massive concrete reactor structures, they said the assumption was that the plants could withstand almost any attack. Move to Close Hearing Defeated Mr. Burnett described the current security perimeters of nuclear power plants, consisting of chain-link fencing with remote television monitors and electronic intrusion alarms, as ''detection rather than protection barriers.'' Lando W. Zech Jr., the commission chairman, tried to have the hearing on the agency's security rules closed to the public, citing ''security reasons.'' The move was supported by witnesses for the nuclear power industry and by Representative Denny Smith of Oregon, the subcommittee's senior Republican. Mr. Smith's motion to close the hearing lost by a vote of 3 to 2. In his responses to Mr. Gejdenson and another committee member, Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon, Mr. Zech veiled some of his remarks ''for security reasons.'' But at one point, after assuring the Congressmen that the commission ''is in daily contact with and has a close professional relationship with national security organizations,'' Mr. Zech observed that the threat of terrorist action against the country's 111 commercial nuclear reactiors ''may not be all that high, in any case.'' Mr. Zech said that through his agency's ''daily conversations with national security organizations, I feel that if they do know of some threat we would be informed'' in time to take defensive measures.",1988-03-10T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

But NASA and planetary scientists see it as opening a new era of research in space by providing a plentiful power source for deep space probes, which has been lacking so far. ''This is an unprecedented opportunity for exploration,'' said Dr. Ronald Greeley, a professor of geological sciences at the Arizona State University. Dr. Greeley is co-leader of a team of 38 scientists who have been working with NASA since February to define what kind of science could be pursued by a nuclear-powered spacecraft at Jupiter. The proposed spacecraft, the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter, would be able to carry new and more powerful instruments and would be able to move in and out of orbit of different Jovian moons. The team of scientists presented its recommendations at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union here last week. Still in the preliminary planning stages, Jimo would cost several billion dollars, which includes developing a space-worthy nuclear reactor. The earliest launch date would be 2011, and, Dr. Greeley said, ''None of us will be surprised if it launches later than 2011.'' Jimo would also have to overcome concerns about what could happen in case of an accident. As many as 1 in 10 rocket launches still fail, opening the possibility of a nuclear reactor exploding high in the atmosphere and dispersing radioactive material. ''As you introduce more nuclear power into space missions, you're looking for trouble,'' said Bruce K. Gagnon, coordinator of the Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space. A space probe like Jimo would also be ''an icebreaker to institutionalize nuclear power in space,'' Mr. Gagnon said. ''Later it would be used for military purposes'' like powering space-based lasers, he said. NASA officials said the nuclear reactor would not be turned on until after the spacecraft reaches orbit and that safety would be a primary design concern. The nuclear fuel will be designed not to break up even if the rocket explodes. The appeal of a small nuclear power generator for propulsion in space is that power becomes more precious with distance from the Sun. In the outer solar system, sunlight is too dim for solar panels and technologies like fuel cells are not reliable enough for the years-long voyage to distant plants. Until now, NASA has used hunks of radioactive plutonium that generate heat as they decay, and the heat is converted into modest amounts of electricity. NASA's Galileo spacecraft, which in September concluded a hugely successful 14-year mission with a deliberate plunge into Jupiter, subsisted on an electrical diet of a few hundred watts -- which would light up a handful of light bulbs. That was still enough for Galileo to produce a wealth of discoveries, especially about Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. Cameras captured up-close images of Europa's exquisitely cracked crust of ice, and magnetic field measurements indicated that beneath that ice is a layer of electrically conductive material -- what planetary scientists believe is a liquid ocean and possibly the most likely place in the solar system to find life. Because Galileo had only small maneuvering thrusters, it could not enter orbit around any of the moons. Galileo's brief flights past Europa produced high-resolution images of less than 0.1 percent of the surface. With nuclear propulsion, mission controllers would be able to drop into orbit around one moon for several months, then restart the engine to propel the probe to the next destination. ''You are in the driver's seat,'' said Raynor L. Taylor, program executive for icy moons orbiter project. ''You can control where you can go.'' With a reactor on board, the spacecraft would also have perhaps a thousand times more power available. That would make possible power-hungry instruments like ground-penetrating radar to look at what lies beneath the surface. Scientists would like to investigate the geological history of the moons' surfaces and identify the types of molecules there, especially ones that might indicate life. Nuclear propulsion is an old idea. In the 1950's, the United States attempted to develop a rocket propelled by small atomic bombs tossed out the back. NASA now envisions something less dramatic. A uranium fission reactor, which would not be turned on until the probe reaches space, would generate heat that would be converted into electricity to power an ion engine. Ion engines use electric fields to accelerate ions to very high speeds, producing thrust. NASA successfully tested a nonnuclear ion engine on an experimental spacecraft called Deep Space 1 in 1998. The ion engines in Jimo would have to be at least 10 times more powerful. NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland announced last month a successful test of one possible design. Sean O'Keefe, NASA's administrator, originally pushed for sending a nuclear-powered spacecraft to Pluto, the only planet not yet visited close-up. However, planetary scientists rallied to the defense of a lower-cost, conventional space probe already in planning. There is a rush to reach Pluto, which is cooling as it moves away from the Sun, before its atmosphere freezes and disappears. The scientists working on Jimo are much more enthusiastic about the promises of nuclear propulsion. ''This would be taking steps in leaps and bounds potentially,'' Dr. Greeley said. Conceptual designs envision a spacecraft about 100 feet long with the nuclear reactor at one end and the scientific instruments at the other. Three studies for more detailed designs are under way. ''We have been surveying industry for their technology and capabilities,'' said Mr. Taylor of NASA. ''We see no roadblocks.''",2003-12-16T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,science

Nobody Seems Interested,"Revive the Shoreham Nuclear Plant? Nobody Seems Interested THE control room of the Shoreham nuclear power plant looks as if everybody left in a hurry a long time ago. Papers are strewn about, desks and chairs are askew, and here and there keys are still inserted in switches on dusty panels. It has been 14 years since the Long Island Lighting Company signed over the $5.5 billion, 800-megawatt Shoreham plant to the Long Island Power Authority for a ceremonial $1, sealing its fate as the only fully licensed nuclear power reactor never to go into commercial operation. Now, with the cost of oil and natural gas used to generate electricity driving utility bills higher and evidence mounting that fossil fuel emissions are linked to global warming, is Shoreham worth a second look? The answer is emphatically no, the power authority, the plant's opponents and even some of its supporters said. Even the most determined and well-financed effort to revive Shoreham would face insurmountable difficulties, the authority and others said. Bert Cunningham, a LIPA vice president for communications, said the authority had no plans to do anything with the plant other than to let it remain as it is. A two-year decommissioning project that the authority completed in October 1994 partly dismantled the interior and removed 560 irradiated fuel assemblies. Other equipment has been auctioned off or left to rust and rot in the plant's darkened interior. The shell of the plant remains standing, Mr. Cunningham said, only because of the cost of knocking it down. Even the most ardent Shoreham supporters are not asking for more. ''It's too far gone,'' said Matthew C. Cordaro, a senior vice president at Lilco during the plant's construction and licensing and now the director of the Center for Management Analysis at the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University. ''You'd have to start from scratch, and nobody is going to make that kind of investment. Right now it is a $5 billion hunk of junk.'' LIPA customers are paying for the Shoreham plant through electric rates without getting any power from it, Mr. Cordaro said. The authority assumed and refinanced about $4.5 billion in Shoreham debt as part of the takeover. Others involved in the 25-year fight to keep the plant from opening said nothing had changed about the impossibility of evacuating the public in the event of a serious accident there. ''If you had to evacuate, you couldn't,'' said Lee E. Koppelman, the former executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, who did evacuation planning for Suffolk County. Suffolk's refusal to participate in federal drills for evacuation within 10 miles of the Shoreham plant, the area for which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission required a plan, became a major impediment for Lilco. Currently, advocates of increased use of nuclear power include the Bush administration and two emerging boosters -- Christie Whitman, a former Environmental Protection Agency administrator, and Patrick Moore, a founder of Greenpeace. Supporters say nuclear power is a way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and dependence on imported oil and gas. But the power industry is showing little interest. Diane Screnci, a spokeswoman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in King of Prussia, Pa., said there were no current proposals for new nuclear plants anywhere in the Northeast. She said the commission had not issued an operating license to a nuclear plant anywhere since 1996, when the 1,121-megawatt Watts Bar generator started up in Tennessee. On Long Island, advocates of power generation that does not rely on oil or gas have lined up behind LIPA's plans for wind turbines off the South Shore and want greater investment in solar technology. But they are not clamoring for nuclear power or a Shoreham revival. ''I don't think offering nuclear power as a solution to global warming is going to go very far on Long Island,'' said Gordian Raacke, the executive director of Renewable Energy Long Island in Bridgehampton. ''Given the history here and the inherent risks of nuclear power, it's a nonstarter. Shoreham is dead and it's not ever coming back to life.'' He added: ''There are always people who say we never should have shut it down, but I've never heard anyone talk about reviving it.'' Leading opponents of the plant were not second-guessing themselves. ''The major problems, including storage of radiological waste, have still not been solved,'' said Nora Bredes, the leader of the Shoreham Opponents Coalition and later a Suffolk County legislator from 1992 to 1998. ''If the federal government would invest in solar energy and renewables the way they do in nuclear power, we would not be in the position we are in now, trying to fight global warming by embracing a technology that still has considerable risks.'' Irving Like, a lawyer in Babylon and a former LIPA trustee whose opposition to the plant dates to the 1960's, when Lilco first proposed a smaller version in Lloyd Harbor, said that nothing about the unsuitability of the plant site had changed. ''The reason is just as valid today as when we first opposed the plant: You can't evacuate an island in the event of a serious accident,'' he said. But Mr. Cordaro, the former Lilco vice president, said it was a tragedy that the plant never opened. ''Our real serious energy problems started with the abandonment of Shoreham,'' he said. ''The main reason behind the plant was to provide an alternative source of energy that didn't depend on expensive foreign oil. If Shoreham were in place today, the fuel surcharges that we are paying LIPA would be a small fraction of what they are now.'' Huge pieces of equipment remain at Shoreham. A gigantic generator shaft lies on the floor of the turbine building. The equally huge steam turbines, which turned only briefly when Lilco tested the plant at low power in 1985, gather rust. Edmund J. Petrocelli, a LIPA project manager, said that even if anyone wanted to buy some of the equipment in the plant, there were practical difficulties. ''The problem is getting it out of here,'' he said. ''With the amount of labor you'd need, it wouldn't be worth it.''",2006-05-28T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Their comments, at a Congressional hearing on nuclear safety, follow concern both in Congress and the agency about hundreds of continuing problems at American nuclear plants involving safety system failures spurred by errors in operation, maintenance and management. The problems have taken on added significance since the Chernobyl reactor disaster in the Soviet Union, many nuclear experts say. The five members of the commission said it was too early to make detailed comparisons between American plants and the Chernobyl reactor. In response to questions by Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who ran the hearing, the commissioners listed 32 reactors at 19 plants. ''Management is the fundamental aspect of safety,'' said James K. Asselstine, a member of the commission. ''There is a wide diversity in management performance among the plants and we don't regulate management very well.'' 'Bit of Arrogance' In the course of the hearing, the commission's chairman, Nunzio J. Palladino, cited a ''recalcitrant'' attitude and a ''bit of arrogance'' by some utility executives toward safety improvements. The best plants included all six units operated by the Duke Power Company in North and South Carolina. The worst included the five units operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority, all of which are now shut down. There are 101 operable American commercial nuclear power reactors. The commissioners promised to provide a written and detailed accounting of their preliminary oral assessment today. The agency's staff in 1980 also ranked American nuclear plants in three categories: below average, average and above average. About 70 units were operable at that time, of which 15 were above average and 21 below average. In many cases, the best and worst plants mentioned today were in the same category as 1980. No similar ranking had been done since. Mr. Markey, whose Subcommittee on Energy Conservation and Power has oversight over nuclear matters, also expressed concern that the agency was cutting back on regulation of the nuclear industry amid continuing safety problems. ''I have been troubled by what appears to be a return to the pre-Three Mile Island business-as-usual mentality,'' Mr. Markey said. That concern was shared by Mr. Asselstine but disputed by the other four commissioners. Lando W. Zech, a commissioner who is to become chairman after Mr. Palladino retires on June 30, said, ''We are not conducting business as usual.'' Some Safety Problems The regulators agreed, however, that their agency's staff had been unable to prevent some significant safety problems in American reactors. They added that they were especially concerned about safety problems at the eight operable Babcock & Wilcox plants similar in design to unit 2 at Three Mile Island, in which the worst American commercial accident occurred in March 1979. Those very sensitive plants are believed more difficult to operate and some, such as Davis-Besse and Rancho Seco, are shut down following serious safety failures last year. The agency is overseeing a full-scale study of those plants by their owners. Multiple human and equipment failures last June caused a loss of vital cooling water and threatened the nuclear fuel core at Davis-Besse. And last December at the Rancho Seco plant there was a loss of power to various control systems, overpressurizing the reactor and spilling some radioactive water. Representative Carlos J. Moorhead of California, the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, a unit of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said, ''These incidents raise important questions whether the N.R.C. is as effective as it could be.''

But they said, ‘No, you must ready them by summer to prepare for an energy shortage.’ ” Now, at summer’s peak, Yokosuka’s two fuel-oil and two gas turbines are cranking out a total of 900,000 kilowatts of electricity — and an abundance of fumes. The generators are helping to replace the 400 million kilowatt-hours of daily electricity production lost this summer because of the shutdown of all but 15 of Japan’s 54 nuclear reactors in the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. Across the country, dozens of other fossil-fuel plants have been fired up, and Japan is importing billions of dollars worth of liquefied natural gas, coal and oil to keep them running. Japan, the world’s third-largest user of electricity behind China and the United States, had counted on an expansion of nuclear power to contain energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, its nuclear program is in retreat, as the public and government officials urge a sharp reduction in the nation’s reliance on nuclear power and perhaps an end to it altogether. As its nuclear program implodes, Japan is grappling with a jump in fuel costs, making an economic recovery from the March earthquake and tsunami all the more difficult. Annual fuel expenses could rise by more than 3 trillion yen, or about $39 billion, the government says. The country, until recently a vocal proponent of measures to curb climate change, is also leaving a bigger carbon footprint. According to government calculations, Japan’s greenhouse gas emissions could rise by as much as 210 million metric tons, or 16 percent, by 2013 from 1990 levels if its nuclear reactors were shut permanently. Under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a global agreement on greenhouse gas emissions, Japan promised to reduce its emissions by 6 percent over that period. “Can nuclear be eliminated?” asked Adam Schatzker, an energy analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “It’s possible, but very costly.” If necessary, Japan could replace the energy capacity lost in the shutdown of its nuclear fleet by increasing the use of natural gas and coal, Mr. Schatzker said. “But even if fossil fuel facilities can make up for the loss of nuclear, it would likely take time, cost a great deal more money and pollute significantly,” he said. For resource-poor Japan, it is an energy shift of an unprecedented scale and speed. A generation ago, the oil shock of 1973, which exposed the country’s overdependence on Middle Eastern oil, forced Japanese companies to focus on energy efficiency and prompted the government to invest heavily in nuclear power. But as it doubled down on nuclear power plants, Japan was slow to develop alternative forms of energy, like solar or wind power, which account for just 1 percent of its electricity supply. Prime Minister Naoto Kan has called for a gradual move away from nuclear energy, and proposed a goal of generating 20 percent of Japan’s electricity from renewable sources, including hydroelectric plants, by the early 2020s. The Parliament is debating legislation to spur that change. A nuclear-free future could come much sooner, however. Nervous local governments have blocked the restart of reactors idled for routine inspections, which occur every 13 months. If no reactors can restart, Japan’s entire nuclear fleet, which provided 30 percent of its electricity in 2009, could be closed by spring. The shutdowns are already causing an energy squeeze. At least three utilities have come close to full capacity during peak demand hours this summer. The government has warned that eastern Japan, including Tokyo, could face an electricity shortage of about 10 percent next summer if no nuclear plants are running. A 10 percent shortage may not be disastrous. This summer, for example, a major energy-saving drive by households and companies drove down peak electricity demand in July by about 20 percent, to 46.3 million kilowatts, averting blackouts despite the energy shortfall, according to Tokyo Electric, the operator of the stricken Fukushima plant. Still, “we take this situation very seriously,” Toshio Nishizawa, chief executive of Tokyo Electric, said this month. Only three of the company’s 17 nuclear reactors are running. A protracted increase in fossil fuel costs is possible to make up for the shortfall, traders say. Japan’s liquefied natural gas imports have jumped for three consecutive months, squeezing global supplies amid strong demand from China and other emerging economies. Imports of coal, which still accounts for 25 percent of Japan’s energy, are also rising. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets predict that in Japan, the world’s largest importer of coal, coal-fired generation could climb as much as 20 percent, equivalent to 3 percent of global supply. Last month, Japan’s power utilities said they would raise electricity prices in September to make up for higher fuel costs. Some businesses worry about the impact of a long-term energy deficit. “We could see Japanese companies start to move overseas,” Hiromasa Yonekura, chairman of Sumitomo Chemical and head of Japan’s largest business lobby, the Keidanren, told reporters last month. “A prolonged energy shortage could harm business and investment.” Meanwhile, the sharply higher energy costs are helping to undermine Japan’s formerly rock-solid balance of trade, which swung into the red for three straight months after the earthquake as exporters struggled to restart production. The country’s trade surplus for July was down 90 percent from a year earlier, on a combination of weak exports and rising energy imports. Elon Musk, the American entrepreneur and founder of the electric car company, Tesla Motors, was in tsunami-stricken Soma late last month to donate $250,000 to build a solar farm there. He said that he saw potential for renewable energy in Japan, but that cumbersome regulations and government foot-dragging were holding the industry back. “The cost of solar power has dropped in recent years, but government policy hasn’t caught up to that,” Mr. Musk said in a telephone interview. One roadblock for renewable power in Japan has been the inability of producers to get an adequate price for their electricity on the market, where they must compete with cheaper power from coal, natural gas and nuclear power. Lawmakers are debating a law that would require utilities to buy electricity from solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric and other renewable power sources, even if it means paying a premium. According to Japan’s Trade Ministry, the move would raise average home electricity bills by about 200 yen (more than $2) a month. “If we, as a society, are willing to pay more, this technology will most certainly spread,” said Norihiro Okumura, an economist with the Tokyo-based Institute of Energy Economics. “And though some in industry say this hurts competitiveness, renewable energy will create new businesses, too.” Until then, the huge generators at the Yokosuka power plant will continue to pick up the slack, fumes notwithstanding. “People once called this the No. 1 power plant in the Orient,” Mr. Koseki said. “We are back, doing what we can.”",2011-08-19T17:31:05.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

Smilan's reply [ Letters to the Long Island Editor, Jan. 26 ] to my Opinion Page piece, ''Blocking Shoreham Blocks L.I. Growth'': My head is bloody but unbowed. A point-by-point exposure would be too lengthy, and I will only touch on some of Mr. Smilan's more obvious misleading statements: Canada is a sovereign nation, and the New York State Legislature has neither the authority nor the funds to double Canadian hydroelectric power. Canadian power, in the quantities needed by Long Island, is a false promise. Canada is already under contract for all the power it can guarantee to deliver and augments its hydroelectric capacity with 16 nuclear power plants and is building seven more for future needs. While there has been some talk of New England and New York State funding the expansion of nuclear plants in Canada, nothing has been done to date. No responsible politician has promised electric power for Long Island from the St. Lawrence River or Niagara Falls. The law that funneled Niagara Falls and St. Lawrence power to New York's municipally owned electric utilities expired last year. The power will be redistributed throughout the Northeast in a manner not yet decided. Lilco will get some too - about enough for each customer to run an electric toaster. Mr. Smilan has made an analogy between Long Island and California that, to be meaningful, would require that Long Island be moved to California. Long Island does not have California's deserts for solar collectors, no windy mountain passes for windmills, no fast-flowing streams for hydropower, no heavy industries for co-generation. And Long Island does not have California's thin crust over the earth's natural nuclear reactor that supplies the heat for geothermal electric generators - a technology that has been developed and exploited over the last 50 years. Geothermal is the source of practically all of California's nonmanmade, nonhydroelectric power. Most of all, I call attention to Mr. Smilan's accusatory tone. Is it not possible that there is a difference of opinion that can be resolved through friendly discussion? No intelligent investor would knowingly put money into obsolete or dangerous technologies - a premise that is implicit in Mr. Smilan's letter. And surely, an investor who risks his capital has made investigations, more thorough than those who are now dabbling in fear politics. If any of those highly touted power-from-the-sky nostrums were remotely practical, there would be enormous funds for their development. No investment group, no nation, socialist or free-enterprise, has shown any interest in the nostrums that are being peddled by opponents of nuclear power plants. This nation must have electricity, and investors will buy shares in companies that, in their judgement, meet the needs of the community. That is what this nation, the envy of the world, is all about. Investors have been funding California's hydroelectric dams and thermal power for a half century. They never needed jeremiads from the antinuke Johnny-come-latelys. The Shoreham nuclear plant was approved by all branches of government, including Suffolk County. Suffolk County issued the building permit for its construction, and to this very day the county is collecting Shoreham taxes from Lilco that will be paid by Lilco's customers. If Mr. Smilan has complaints about the American way and due process, he should take them to Suffolk County, which has been growing fat on Shoreham's taxes while prohibiting Lilco from allowing it to perform the function for which Suffolk County issued the building permit. There are 345 nuclear power plants in the world today; 180 more are under construction. The world nuclear power industry replaces more than two billion barrels of oil a year, twice the production of Saudi Arabia. Nuclear power plants, more than any other factor, have broken the back of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The Suffolk County nuclear fear campaign will not stop nuclear power. It will only inflate Long Island's electric bill. HERBERT JAFFE Freeport Herbert Jaffe is a director of the Association of Investors in New York Utilities Inc.

Prematurely retiring a facility like Vermont Yankee is regrettable for a number of reasons. Since 2002, Vermont Yankee’s power generation has saved New England customers about $330 million in electricity rates, compared with the price of buying power from the spot market. Over the years, Vermont Yankee has prevented the emission of more than 50 million tons of carbon dioxide and other pollutants. But it’s now very likely that the power generated by the Vermont Yankee facility will be replaced by carbon-emitting power sources, making the state’s carbon emission goals difficult to meet. The effect of the closing of Vermont Yankee on New England should be a forewarning; to ensure affordable and carbon-free power across the country, we must do everything we can to ensure that nuclear energy remains part of our energy mix. It is simply unsustainable for the United States to continue to allow well-functioning nuclear energy plants to close.

But reminders, while infrequent, were jarring. The governor’s office mailed residents potassium iodide pills, to take in case of a radioactive leak. Emergency sirens occasionally sounded in the middle of the night (false alarms, residents were told). And anyone who drove south out of town was confronted with the plant’s looming twin domes. But after nearly half a century living with a radioactive neighbor, San Clemente is now adjusting to a future without the San Onofre nuclear power plant, whose proximity has long shaped life here in ways big and small. Last month, Southern California Edison announced that the nuclear plant, which was closed in January 2012 when a problem with its new steam generators led to a small leak of radioactive steam, would shut down for good. Many residents rejoiced at this news, but San Onofre’s closing raises some uncomfortable questions for nearby towns that had relied on it as a source of cheap energy and jobs. Worries about radiation poisoning, which increased here after the 2011 meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan, have suddenly been supplanted by more mundane concerns, like how much the cost of electricity will go up. “For most residents, I think San Onofre was out of sight, out of mind,” Tim Brown, a San Clemente city councilman, said. “They took the power it generated for granted. Now that it’s gone, well, we’ll see how much it really does affect our lives. “I anticipate it’s going to be tough for some folks,” he continued. “The plant was a large employer in town. It brought a lot of money and activity to our city. And the new normal is going to be ever-increasing power rates.” As more of the aging nuclear reactors around the country are closed — four reactors, including the two at San Onofre, have been retired this year — more communities around the country may soon find themselves in circumstances similar to San Clemente’s. The dismantling of San Onofre’s reactors will be among the largest decommissioning of nuclear power plants in the country. Experts say it will likely take at least a decade. But the effects of the plant’s closing are already reverberating. By September, Southern California Edison will reduce its staff at the plant to 600 employees from 1,500. Electricity prices have increased since the plant, which is about halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego and powered 1.4 million homes, went offline last year. Last week, when the power went out at Lily Tally’s home in San Clemente, she worried that erratic electricity service — especially in the summer, when demand for power is highest — would become more common. She said she and her husband were now planning to put solar panels on their house. Still, she said she was relieved that San Onofre was closing. Interstate 5, the only road out of town, runs beside the plant’s trademark twin domes. So Ms. Tally and her husband kept their S.U.V. ready in case they needed a different escape route. They planned to drive with their two young sons through the nature preserve east of town. “It was always in the back of my mind, especially with the earthquakes here,” Ms. Tally, 35, said. “Safety-wise, I do feel better now. But then there’s the ambivalence about having other sources of power that will cost more.” The rising cost of power is not the only concern for local businesses. In the non-summer months, seasonal plant workers often made up about 30 percent of the guests at some San Clemente hotels, although that number has dwindled since last year. Nancy Hunt, a local real estate broker, said consultants, who would work at the nuclear plant for months at a time, also accounted for a large portion of the renters in town. “The workers rent in our community. They go to the beauty shops here. They go to the restaurants,” Ms. Hunt said. “We will miss them.” San Onofre’s first reactor began operating in 1968, and Units 2 and 3 followed in the early 1980s. Unit 1 was shuttered in 1992. Back then, Southern California Edison was recruiting local engineering students like John Mourer to work at the nuclear plant. The company paid for him to finish college, and he began working at the plant in 1985. But today, attitudes toward nuclear energy in California are different. State law bans the permitting of new nuclear facilities until the federal government built a permanent disposal site for nuclear waste, which effectively amounts to a moratorium on new plants. The only other nuclear plant in the state, Diablo Canyon on the Central Coast, has also been operating since the 1980s. Now 50, after working at San Onofre more than half his life, Mr. Mourer is looking for work as far afield as Abu Dhabi, and debating whether to bring his four children with him. “I’ve lived here my whole life, a lot of us have,” Mr. Mourer said. “But there are not a lot of other nuclear plants in California.” This week, the last of the nuclear fuel was removed from San Onofre’s reactors. Activists hope the state will soon be free of nuclear power. But the nuclear waste, which still remains at San Onofre, continues to concern local officials. And the federal government is no closer to establishing a national storage facility for nuclear waste than it was when San Onofre’s reactors were built. “We still have the nuclear waste issue to address,” said Lori Donchak, a San Clemente city councilwoman. “This is not an issue unique to San Clemente. This is a national issue. The waste needs to go somewhere where it will be permanently taken care of.” While the nuclear waste remains on-site and the plant is being decommissioned, the emergency sirens will stay in San Clemente. But for many residents, just the knowledge that the plant is no longer splitting atoms has already offered some peace of mind. Over the years, many had turned to gallows humor to quell their fears, guessing the number of limbs they would come out of the water with if they surfed near San Onofre, or joking that the plant’s twin domes looked like a monument to Dolly Parton. Chryssa Atkinson, 51, the mother of two teenagers, said her son liked to surf near San Onofre. Like many other surfers, he insisted the water — which the nuclear plant used to cool the reactors — was warmer than at nearby beaches. “I was not a fan,” Ms. Atkinson said. “I’d tell him, ‘Yes, the water is warmer, but you didn’t have that tail before you went in.’ ” But now, for the first time, she doesn’t mind her children surfing near the power plant. “Now that it’s closed, I tell them, ‘Sure, go for it.’ ”",2013-07-26T02:55:18.000+02:00,NYTIMES,national-u.s.

The result has been a financial quagmire — one that is about to deepen. Toshiba warned on Tuesday that it might need to write off “several billion U.S. dollars” because of its purchase of an American construction firm that specializes in nuclear power projects. In a statement , Toshiba said it was still figuring out the size of the write-off, which was related to its acquisition a year ago of the business, CB&I Stone & Webster. The scale of the potential write-off was notable given that Toshiba’s nuclear subsidiary in the United States, Westinghouse, bought the business for $229 million. Toshiba’s share price dropped 12 percent on Tuesday. Toshiba and CB&I Stone & Webster’s former parent, the engineering group Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, have been arguing over the business’s true value ever since the deal closed. Projects that CB&I Stone & Webster is working on have been hit by delays and cost overruns. In dueling legal claims, Westinghouse and Chicago Bridge & Iron have been disputing how expensive the delays will be and which company should take the financial hit. The purchase was a gamble from the start: The Toshiba subsidiary was paying relatively little to buy the business, but its ultimate costs could end up being many times higher if things went badly. That outcome now looks likely. “Westinghouse has found that the cost to complete the U.S. projects will far surpass the original estimates, mainly due to increases in key project parameters, resulting in far lower asset value than originally determined,” Toshiba said on Tuesday. Toshiba’s nuclear ambitions have hammered its bottom line. Prospects for companies central to its expanding empire have soured, their revenue failing to cover what Toshiba paid to buy them. Toshiba bought Westinghouse in 2006 for $5.4 billion, in a deal that proved to be expensive and ill-timed. Toshiba took a $2.3 billion write-down on the acquisition last year. That followed embarrassing revelations about its accounting practices, in which it acknowledged overstating revenue at a number of its divisions, including nuclear power. Even at the time of the Westinghouse purchase, many analysts said Toshiba was paying too much for the company. Then came the global financial crisis and an accelerating revolution in shale oil and gas extraction, which reduced the cost of more traditional alternatives to nuclear power. The nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima, Japan, in 2011 compounded Toshiba’s problems by crippling the atomic power industry in Japan , contributing to delays and downsizing elsewhere. Despite such problems, Toshiba sees nuclear power as a better bet than other businesses like consumer electronics, in which Japanese companies have lost competitiveness to rivals in China. Toshiba’s chief executive, Satoshi Tsunakawa, reaffirmed the company’s commitment to nuclear power this year after he was appointed in a management shake-up following the accounting scandal. “It’s achievable,” Mr. Tsunakawa told reporters in June, referring to the company’s official goal of building 45 nuclear reactors around the world by fiscal 2030. Industry analysts have said that the target is a stretch. In the United States, Westinghouse has been working with CB&I Stone & Webster on two projects to expand existing nuclear power stations by building new reactors . The projects, at the V.C. Summer station in South Carolina and the Alvin W. Vogtle plant in Georgia, are several years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget. The write-off that Toshiba warned about on Tuesday hinges on the portion of CB&I Stone & Webster’s value that accountants call good will — essentially, the premium that an acquirer pays over the value of a company’s tangible assets, like factories and equipment. Toshiba said it initially estimated that premium at $87 million. But after a review, it said, it now believed the premium was far larger — so large, in fact, that CB&I Stone & Webster was in effect worth less than nothing when Toshiba bought it. It was possible, Toshiba said, that “all or part” of the difference would have to be deducted from its own financial accounts.",2016-12-27T12:38:07.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-dealbook
af54b78d-f1d0-4ea1-b44f-fd0f0b5fa908,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/us/politics/18cnd-mccain.html,McCain Urges Building 45 New Nuclear Plants,"SPRINGFIELD, Mo.  Senator John McCain said Wednesday that he wanted 45 new nuclear reactors to be built in the United States by 2030, a goal that he called “as difficult as it is necessary.” In his third straight day of campaign speechmaking about energy and $4-a-gallon gasoline, the presumptive Republican nominee told the crowd at a town hall-style meeting at Missouri State University that he saw nuclear power as a clean, safe alternative to conventional sources of energy that emit greenhouse gases. He said his ultimate goal was 100 new nuclear plants. Mr. McCain has long promoted nuclear reactors, but Wednesday was the first time that he specified the number of plants he envisioned. Currently, there are 104 reactors in the country supplying some 20 percent of the electricity consumed. No new nuclear power plant has been built in the United States since the 1970s. “China, Russia and India are all planning to build more than a hundred new power plants among them in the coming decades,” Mr. McCain said in this pocket of Missouri that is reliably Republican. “Across Europe, there are 197 reactors in operation, and nations including France and Belgium derive more than half their electricity from nuclear power. And if all of these nations can find a way to carry out great goals in energy policy, then I assure you that the United States is more than equal to the challenge.” Although there has been a shift in opinion in the industry and among some environmentalists toward more nuclear power  it is clean and far safer than at the time of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979  most environmentalists are skeptical of the latest claims by its advocates. They also contend that no utility will put its own money into building a plant unless the federal government lavishly subsidizes it. “Wall Street won’t invest in these plants because they are too expensive and unreliable, so Senator McCain wants to shower the nuclear industry with billions of dollars of taxpayer handouts,” said Daniel J. Weiss, who heads the global warming program at the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a liberal research group. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Mr. McCain’s chief domestic policy adviser, said Mr. McCain arrived at the number 45 as a goal consistent with his desire to expand nuclear power, “but not so large as to be infeasible given permitting and construction times.” Mr. McCain appeared at the event with several energy executives as well as Gen. James L. Jones, a retired former commandant of the Marines and supreme commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, who has been mentioned as an out-of-the-box choice of running mate for Mr. McCain’s Democratic rival for president, Senator Barack Obama. Mr. Jones, a member of the Chevron board of directors, is now a Middle East envoy for President Bush. At the question-and-answer session after Mr. McCain made formal remarks, an audience member said she would “love to see someone like General Jones” as Mr. McCain’s running mate. Mr. McCain responded that “General Jones has served this country with honor and courage for many years and I am confident that he will continue to do so.” The senator added, “He certainly would if I were president of the United States.”",2008-06-18T08:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,continuousnews-u.s.-politics

Nixon championed a long-term solution: to have 1,000 nuclear reactors in place in America by the year 2000 as part of a national energy independence plan. That never came to pass: 104 nuclear reactors operate today, compared with 40 then. The last permit for construction of what became a fully operational nuclear plant was issued in 1978. The main obstacles to the industry’s growth were huge cost overruns linked to regulatory changes, and shifts in demand for electricity, although the Three Mile Island accident of 1979, litigation and the 1970s and ’80s antinuclear movement also played a big role. Today, activists who figured prominently in the movement’s teach-ins and protest rallies are hoping that Japan’s nuclear crisis will rekindle a protest movement in the United States. Their aim, they say, is not just to block the Obama administration’s push for new nuclear construction, but to convince Americans that existing plants pose dangers. “I look at Japan and think this could very possibly be us,” said the musician Graham Nash, who with the group Crosby, Stills and Nash took part in the 1979 No Nukes concerts and a rally that drew nearly a quarter of a million people to the tip of Manhattan. James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, John Hall, Jackson Browne and Bruce Springsteen were also on the bill for the events, which came months after a partial core meltdown at Three Mile Island. It was the peak of the antinuclear movement, and campaigners felt that policymakers were finally awakening to their message. “The circumstances all came together — it was like energetic waves converging, and it was pretty powerful,” Mr. Nash said. “There has not been a nuclear plant built since.” Since a tsunami knocked out power at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station last week, leading to explosions and a desperate battle to cool reactors and spent fuel rods, more Americans seem to be rethinking their position on nuclear power, said John Hall, a former member of the band Orleans who helped organize the concert and was, until recently, a congressman representing a district in upstate New York. “I see it in e-mails, Web postings and conversations with friend and neighbors,” he said. Paul Gunter, the director of the reactor oversight project at the advocacy group Beyond Nuclear , said a protest vigil planned for Sunday at the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant could prove a test case. The reactor, whose troubles in recent years have included the collapse of a cooling tower and leaks of radioactive tritium from underground pipes, is a near twin of Unit No. 1 at the troubled Daiichi nuclear station. The State of Vermont argues that the plant is unreliable. “Sunday will be the first indicator of the depth of the public mood,” Mr. Gunter said of the protest. Just before the earthquake and tsunami in Japan hit, the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted to reject all challenges to extending the operating license of the Vermont Yankee plantder. The movement against nuclear power in this country goes back almost as far as the industry itself. The United Auto Workers opposed construction of the Fermi 1 plant outside Detroit as early as 1957. While it was eventually built, proposed plants in Queens, N.Y., and outside San Francisco were blocked by local protests in the next decade. The movement grew in the 1970s as proposals for new plants multiplied and local opposition groups emerged. Sometimes the protests succeeded only in part. The Clamshell Alliance, for example, campaigned to block the construction of Seabrook Station in New Hampshire, part of which was eventually built and began operating. Half of the proposed plan was shelved. Harvey Wasserman, the editor of NukeFree.org, helped organized some of the protests and at one point was arrested outside the Seabrook plant. He attributes the movement’s broad appeal to its peaceful tactics. “This is a terrible time for those of us who’ve been fighting nukes all these years,” he said of the crisis in Japan. “We’re way too familiar with the tangible toll these releases in Japan will take on the people of the area and the workers at the plant.” Although protests continued in the United States and Europe throughout the 1980s, particularly after the Chernobyl accident in Russia in 1986, the movement may have become a victim of nuclear plant construction’s decline. As part of his plan to rein in the greenhouse gas emissions however, President Obama has billed nuclear power as a clean energy alternative and enabled loan guarantees  http://lpo.energy.gov/ to begin flowing for new plants. Such construction also has support among many Republicans in the newly elected House, although some have moved to strip subsidies for renewable fuels like solar and wind power from the 2012 budget. After Mr. Obama took office, some environmental groups seemed to be tipping toward cautious support for nuclear power. But that was stilled last week. Meanwhile, some of the musicians who were central to the movement in its early days are thinking of enlisting younger performers in the campaign. “I was in contact with Bonnie about getting some new bands involved,” Mr. Nash said. “We had a lot of energy back then, but it gets wearing to see the same old groups after a while.”",2011-03-19T04:47:49.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-science-environment

Don’t Blame the Greens.,"But the economy snapped back — thanks to government stimulus programs — far faster than anticipated. And so, too, did demand for energy. But this industry does not ramp up quickly. So, there was not enough natural gas, let alone renewables, to fill in the gap. America has enough oil and natural gas to meet its own needs for now, but its ability to export liquefied natural gas to help others is limited, especially when every utility in Europe and Asia is trying to meet newly minted environmental, social and governance standards for clean energy and therefore is desperate to import natural gas. When every country jumps in at once, the price goes crazy. Or the lights go out. Don’t get me wrong. I am as green as ever. But I’m not a nice green. I am a mean green. Achieving the scale of clean energy that we need requires not only wind, solar and hydro, but also a carbon tax in every major industrial economy, nuclear power and natural gas as a bridge. If you oppose all those, you’re not serious about what scientists tell us needs to be done right now — put in place enough noncarbon-emitting fuels to manage the destructive aspects of climate change that have become unavoidable, so we can avoid those that would be unmanageable. Sadly, in an overreaction to the Fukushima nuclear accident, Germany decided in 2011 to phase out all of its nuclear power by 2022 — nuclear power stations that in the year 2000 generated 29.5 percent of Germany’s power generation mix. All of that has to be replaced by wind, solar, hydro and natural gas, and there is just not enough now. As Bill Gates points out in his smart book “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,” the only way to reach our climate targets is to shift production of all the big heavy industries, like steel, cement and automobiles, as well as how we heat our homes and power our cars, to electricity generated from clean energy. Safe and affordable nuclear power has to be part of our mix because, Gates argues, “it is the only carbon-free, scalable energy source that’s available 24 hours a day.” Meanwhile, though, this energy crisis is coinciding with the stalemate in the talks between the U.S. and Iran about restoring the nuclear deal that Donald Trump recklessly tore up in 2018 — without any alternative plan to curb Iran’s nuclear program. To pressure us, Iran has resumed enriching uranium to levels such that U.S. officials now believe it could be only a few months, or less, away from having enough fissile material for a single bomb. It would take much longer for Iran to build a warhead and delivery system, but some U.S. officials believe that Iran just wants to make itself a threshold nuclear power, like Japan, where it would stay just a few turns of the screw away from actually having a bomb. This would give it all the deterrence it needs. Both Israel and America have vowed not to let Iran get that close to the doorstep of a nuclear weapon. Alas, we are entering crunchtime.",2021-10-06T01:00:07.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

The European Commission said it had begun consultations with European Union countries on the proposal, which is intended to provide a common set of definitions of what constitutes a “sustainable investment” in Europe. Any final plan would be subject to approval by a majority of member states, or by the European Parliament. “The Commission considers there is a role for natural gas and nuclear as a means to facilitate the transition towards a predominantly renewable-based future,” the statement, released on Saturday, said. The proposal caps one of the most heated political battles in Europe at a time when its leaders have pledged to pull the planet back from the brink of climate catastrophe. It follows months of intense lobbying pitting a pronuclear bloc led by President Emmanuel Macron of France, Europe’s biggest atomic power producer, over objections from Germany and other countries that are wary of a proliferation of nuclear power on European soil.",2022-01-02T22:11:20.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

In a unanimous vote in Washington, the agency's five commissioners authorized the issuance of a full-power operating license as soon as the commission's staff determined that the plant was ready. A commission spokesman, Karl Abraham, said the license was expected to be issued by the commission's Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation ''within the next several days.'' He said commission inspectors were at the plant in Waterford, Conn., monitoring the preparations. A $3.8 Billion Plant Millstone 3, Connecticut's fourth and largest nuclear power plant, is now expected to cost more than $3.8 billion, according to the utility, compared with its original estimate of $400 million in 1971. Construction began in 1974. Northeast Utilities, the principal owner, has said the plant, at Millstone Point on Long Island Sound, will save 12 million barrels of oil a year, but consumer groups have contended that it is not needed at this time. The utility has said it will seek a electricity rate increase of about 9 percent in each of the next three years to phase in the cost of Millstone 3. The company's initial request for a $155.5 million rate increase is before the State Department of Public Utility Control. The proposal is opposed by consumer advocates and some state officials. Increasing Power in Stages Northeast Utilities said issuance of the license would allow power at the plant to be increased in stages of testing over the next few months, with the goal of reaching full commercial production by May 1. Last Nov. 25 the commission authorized the beginning of low-power testing, with output limited to 5 percent of the plant's capacity of 1,150 megawatts. The plant's pressurized water reactor produced its first nuclear reaction last Thursday night, the utility said. ''This is the culmination of years of hard work by thousands of dedicated people here in Connecticut,'' E. James Ferland, the president of Northeast Utilities, said of the commission's action today. Northeast Utilities, which provides electricity to parts of Connecticut and Massachusetts, already operates two other nuclear plants - Millstone 1 and 2 - at Waterford, and the Connecticut Yankee nuclear plant at Haddam Neck near the Connecticut River.",1986-01-30T06:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,metropolitan-desk-new-york

A miniature version of that ''battery,'' really a small nuclear generator, has been used as the power source of cardiac pacemakers in thousands of patients throughout the world since 1970. The battery contains less than .25 grams of plutonium 238, which acts as the heat source. It is highly effective and has proved to be safe (there has been no increased cancer rate in the wearers of these devices). Battery failure is very rare, infinitely less common than with any other pacemaker power source. Ninety percent of the units continue to function after 19 years, longer than any other pacemaker models. Interest in these devices has diminished over the last 10 years because other long-lived, smaller batteries were developed and also because of the troublesome paperwork and licensing required of physicians who implant the nuclear models. Recently the nuclear battery was rediscovered and incorporated in state-of-the-art pacemakers at a cost comparable to non-nuclear models, but with a life expectancy of 20 years or more. Perhaps the sterling performance of Voyager 2 will help to rekindle enthusiasm for the nuclear pacemaker that is made of the same stuff.

Credit... David Guttenfelder for The New York Times KYIV, Ukraine — With Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant still disconnected from the national power grid on Friday morning, there was growing concern not only over the safe operation of the plant but the consequences for millions of Ukrainians — many living in Russian-controlled regions of the south. Ukrainian engineers were able to restore damaged external power lines after repeated shelling on Thursday, ensuring the facility is able to meet its own power needs and continue to operate safely, according to Ukrainian and international officials. But with fires raging around the plant, new shelling in and around the facility on a near daily basis and an exhausted and stressed team of Ukrainian engineers tasked with keeping the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant running safely, calls for international intervention grew louder. “Nowhere in the history of this world has a nuclear power plant become a part of a combat zone, so this really has to stop immediately,” Bonnie Denise Jenkins, the State Department’s under secretary for arms control and international security, told reporters in Brussels on Thursday. Russian actions, she said, “have created a serious risk of a nuclear incident — a dangerous radiation release — that could threaten not only the people and environment of Ukraine, but also affect neighboring countries and the entire international community.” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine used his nightly address to underscore the risks, saying emergency systems had worked on Thursday, but that, had they failed, the country, and the world, would be contending with a nuclear accident. And though the immediate threat appears to have been averted, the disconnection of the plant from the national grid caused widespread power outages across southern Ukraine, adding to a humanitarian disaster wrought by the war. When fully operational, the plant provides electricity for some 20 percent of the country, including roughly four million homes. As of 9 a.m. on Friday, the two nuclear reactors that were operational at the time of the outage remained disconnected but work was being carried out to get them back online, according to Ukraine’s nuclear energy agency, Energoatom. It wasn’t immediately clear how long that might take or how many people were still without power. The Zhaporizhzhia regional government said that as of Friday morning, energy supplies were “partially restored” from other sources. Residents across the region reported widespread power outages overnight and into the morning. Ukrainians in occupied areas are already living under difficult conditions. In eastern Ukraine, Russian bombardments and fierce fighting have destroyed nearly all of the infrastructure needed to provide heat, power and clean water, leading the Ukrainian government to order a mandatory evacuation of the less than 200,000 people still living in the eastern Ukrainian region known as Donbas. The situation in the occupied south is more complicated. Many of the towns and cities there fell in the first days of the war and were spared the widespread destruction witnessed in the east. But if the nuclear plant were to remain offline, the power for hundreds of thousands living in occupied territories could be compromised. “The south of Ukraine — the occupied areas — is already in a state of humanitarian disaster,” Mr. Zelensky said. “In addition to all the evil that the occupiers brought there, electricity, water and sewage were cut off.” Though the plant’s disconnection from the national grid appeared to be the related to nearby fighting, Ukrainian officials have been warning for weeks that Moscow wants to divert the power from the plant for its own needs by disconnecting it from the Ukrainian grid and then reconnecting it to the Russian grid, a potentially complicated process in a war zone that leaves room for an accident. Ms. Jenkins, the State Department official, said the U.S. is working through the United Nations Security Council to persuade Moscow not to attempt such a potentially risky move. “We don’t want that to happen,” she said. “We are continuing to talk with Russia and through these Security Council discussions and to impress upon Russia not to do that.”",2022-08-26T11:58:56.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire
3dc1eb06-0baa-5305-aa76-bc5c1e024236,https://www.tipsproject.eu/tips/,Russians Plan Floating Nuclear Plants,"The United Industrial Corporation , a Russian manufacturer, said this week that the world’s first floating nuclear power plant will go into operation on Russia’s eastern coast by the end of 2012. The manufacturer, known also as O.P.K., told Green Inc. that the first model would be used to help power Viluchinsk, a city on the Kamchatka peninsula that serves as an atomic submarine base. O.P.K. said similar models could power other cities in northern Russia in the future. But according to nuclear experts, mining companies are likely to use Russian-built floating reactors to power operations to extract oil and gas and valuable minerals from the Arctic and other remote regions. O.P.K. is building the plant in the shape of a ship 144 meters (472 feet) in length and 30 meters (98 feet) wide to accommodate two 35-megawatt reactors. Construction of the plant, called KLT-40C, began in February this year. Concern Energoatom , a nuclear power plant operator, signed a contract this month to buy the first model, worth 226.8 million euros, O.P.K. said. The cost of the reactors per kilowatt hour would be equal to building a hydropower station and “exploitation of such a particular plant will be much in demand both in industrial and developing regions,” O.P.K. said. The advantages of floating nuclear plants include maneuverability of the machines so that they can be serviced, as well as the ability to be towed near remote settlements or sites of energy-intensive industries — like water desalination — where need is greatest for electricity. Other potential benefits include the offshore locale, away from population areas where residents might otherwise object to the presence of nuclear power. But putting reactors at sea is likely to raise concerns about the safety in extreme weather conditions, vulnerability to terrorism, and disposal of the radioactive waste they produce.",2009-07-09T17:07:15.000+02:00,NYTIMES,science

The Federal regulatory commission on June 22 cited a problem with declining performance at Indian Point 3 and its August 1992 report card on the 17-year-old plant, which showed inadequate management controls. ""What this means is that we're going to spend extra resources and send extra inspectors to keep an eye on the place,"" said Diane Screnci, a spokeswoman for the commission's Region 1 office, which covers the Northeast. Indian Point 3 is owned and operated by the New York Power Authority, the largest non-Federal public power agency, which supplies electricity to government customers in Westchester and New York City. 109 Nuclear Plants Operating Indian Point 3 is considered an average-size installation, producing 980 megawatts of power, compared with newer plants, like Palo Verde near Phoenix, which produce about 1,300 megawatts, Ms. Screnci said. One of the country's oldest plants, Yankee Rowe, in Rowe, Mass., produced 175 watts but was shut down last year after operating for 30 years after questions arose about the stability of its reactor vessel. In all, there are 109 operating plants in the United States licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In a June 22 letter to Richard M. Flynn, chairman of the board of trustees of the New York Power Authority, the Federal commission said that both plants operated by the authority -- Indian Point 3 and the James A. FitzPatrick, in Oswego -- required close monitoring. The Oswego plant has been on the commission's watch list since February, 1992, although the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has acknowledged improvements made there since that time. The commissions letter said that a licensee performance assessment in August showed ""declining performance in operations, maintenance and surveillance, emergency preparations, safety assessment and quality verification, and most notable, engineering and technical support,"" at Indian Point 3. The major contributors to the declining performance, the letter said, were ineffective review and correction of problems by management and an increasing number of plant deficiencies. The Federal commission fined the power authority $462,500 last year for a series of violations, the largest amount paid that year by any of the 31 nuclear plants in Region 1, Ms. Screnci said. At least for now, however, there is no question about Indian Point 3's being closed by the commission, she said. ""If we didn't believe they could operate safely, we'd order them to shut down. Our decision was to put them on the watch list."" The plant was shut down voluntarily on Feb. 27 by the power authority. ""We placed the plant on our own watch list so we could bring about fundamental changes,"" Mr. Flynn said. He said conditions at the plant deteriorated because officials had relied on assurances from plant managers and what he called ""paper evidence that everything was O.K."" Advisory Group Established Since last year, the two resident managers at the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick plants have been replaced, and John C. Brons, the public authority's president and chief operating office, resigned in a decision ""prompted by problems at the two plants,"" Mr. Flynn said. An outside firm, Prism Consulting of Emeryville, Calif., was brought in to evaluate operations, and last week the authority agreed to establish a Nuclear Advisory Committee, made up of independent nuclear experts, to report to the board of trustees on conditions at the power plants. ""We're not denying the problems,"" said Mr. Flynn. ""We're hard at work remedying them."" No date has been set for reopening Indian Point 3, although Mr. Flynn said he is hoping for a late fall or early winter restart. The shutdown of Indian Point 3 means that the power authority must rely more on its Charles Poletti Power Project in Queens, which operates on oil and natural gas and on electricity generated by its larger hydroelectric projects. Costs Are Passed On The FitzPatrick nuclear plant, along with smaller hydroelectric projects -- including the Kensico Project in Valhalla -- will continue to provide electricity. Since the shutdown of Indian Point 3, the power authority has also purchased electricity from the New York Power Pool, an organization of state- and investor-owned utilities, and from domestic and Canadian utilities. The increased costs have been passed on to the customers in terms of energy adjustment charges on their bills, said Stephen Shoenholz, a power authority spokesman. The power authority, which is state owned, supplies one-fourth of the state's electricity, Mr. Shoenholz said. Among its customers are municipal governments in Westchester and New York City, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which operates New York City's subways and Metro-North Commuter Railroad, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Indian Point 3 is one of two nuclear power plants next to each other on the Hudson River. Indian Point 1 was built by Con Edison 30 years ago, one of the first licenses granted by the Atomic Energy Commission for commercial production of nuclear power. It was decommissioned 11 years later and replaced by Indian Point 2.",1993-07-04T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

To the Editor: While you acknowledge in a Jan. 21 editorial that it is impossible for our country's 103 nuclear power plants to ever be completely safe from terrorist attacks, you do not point out other troubling aspects of this failed industry. Nuclear-generated electricity is a very expensive form of power when all taxpayer subsidies and operating costs are considered. Nuclear power produces radioactive wastes that remain hazardous to the environment and public health for thousands of years. The nuclear industry has yet to determine how to safely dispose of the 50 years' worth of waste that has accumulated, and is faced with increased nuclear weapons proliferation should these materials fall into the wrong hands. Increased conservation and energy efficiency, reduced consumption and the expedited development of alternative energy sources are the only safe and sustainable energy options for the future.

UPINGTON, South Africa — In one of the most sun-drenched corners of the planet, a 670-foot tower rises above a desert dotted with 4,160 mirrors. Tracking the sun throughout the day, the mirrors, called heliostats, redirect the sun’s rays into the tower, where water is heated to generate steam — and electricity. Since the plant, Khi Solar One, began operating early this year near Upington, it has produced enough power for 65,000 homes during the day, but also, thanks to the latest technology, for a few hours after the sun sets. South Africa is experiencing a boom in renewable energy, nonexistent here just a few years ago. Now, dozens of solar plants clustered in the country’s northern reaches and wind farms operating along the southern coast are generating 2.2 gigawatts — more than what most African nations can produce. As the facilities have increased production, they have helped stop the blackouts that plagued South Africa until a year ago. In a country still dependent on coal, the renewable energy industry has been lauded by many energy experts and environmentalists as a model for developing nations. But South Africa’s utility, Eskom, and some government officials do not see it that way. Criticizing wind and solar energy as costly and unreliable, they are pressing instead for a huge investment in nuclear energy: three power stations with a total of up to nine reactors to generate 9.6 gigawatts. The battle over South Africa’s energy future has become increasingly fierce, often fought over kilowatts and other technical details, sometimes waged with bitter personal attacks between functionaries and electrical engineers. It is also being fought on South Africa’s larger political landscape, with forces seemingly close to the scandal-ridden administration of President Jacob Zuma pushing hardest for the nuclear deal while others support an expansion of renewables. “A line of attack is that anyone who wants nuclear is linked to President Zuma and therefore is corrupt,” said Matshela Koko, the head of generation at Eskom. “People aren’t dispassionate about nuclear. People have taken a political view. If you’re dispassionate, and look at the science and engineering of it, you will conclude that you need nuclear.” Developing nations are closely watching the standoff between nuclear and renewables, two forms of low-carbon energy that they hope will power their growing economies. Countries as diverse as Bangladesh, Belarus, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam are adopting nuclear power. In Africa, many countries are looking at solar and wind as a quick way to bolster generation capacity by leapfrogging older and dirtier sources of energy. Renewable energy could also bring diversification to nations dangerously dependent on a single source of electricity, like Malawi and Zambia , which have experienced crippling blackouts because of a severe drought that lowered water levels at hydroelectric dams. As sub-Saharan Africa’s most advanced economy, South Africa has about half of the continent’s power-generating capacity. It has operated a nuclear power station, the only one on the continent, since 1984, though coal-fired power plants generate about 80 percent of its electricity. Because of poor planning, the blackouts began in 2008. In 2011, desperate for more juice, the country started a program to attract private solar and wind producers that bid against one another on a number of projects. By this June, the renewable program had attracted 102 projects worth $14.4 billion. Forty-four facilities, built on average in less than two years, are producing 2.2 gigawatts. By contrast, the construction of two huge government coal plants is facing years of delay and severe cost overruns. “The program has been very successful, clear of any corruption and very well run,” said Wikus van Niekerk, the director of the Center for Renewable and Sustainable Energy Studies at Stellenbosch University. “It’s been seen by many people in the rest of the world as one of the most successful procurement programs for renewable energy. It’s something that the South African government and public should be proud about.” Abengoa, a Spanish company, was the first to win contracts to build two concentrated solar plants near Upington. Unlike traditional solar plants, a concentrated solar plant harnesses the sun’s energy to produce steam, which can be stored for a few hours and then used to run turbines after the sun sets. The region surrounding Upington experiences temperatures up to 113 degrees Fahrenheit (45 degrees Celsius), and intense sunshine year-round. “South Africa is one of the best places in the world for solar power,” said José David Cayuela Olivencia, the general manager of Khi Solar One. Concentrated solar power can generate electricity at peak times of the day after the sun sets — but at a cost. The electricity produced by Khi Solar One, which Eskom must buy as part of a 20-year contract, is significantly costlier than regular solar power. Eskom officials say the supply from traditional solar and wind power plants fluctuates or comes during the day, when it is not needed. At 7 p.m., when demand peaks, “the wind may not be moving, and the sun has set,” said Brian Molefe, Eskom’s chief executive. He added that further expansion of renewable energy should “go slow” until cheap and efficient storage technology for renewables is developed. As South Africa weans itself off coal over the coming decades, in part to comply with the Paris agreement to mitigate climate change , Eskom officials argue that only an expansion of nuclear power will meet the country’s energy needs. “We need baseload capacity,” said Mr. Koko, Eskom’s head of generation, referring to plants that can run around the clock. “We don’t want it to be coal, so it has to be nuclear.” But others say that building nuclear reactors, with a life span of 60 to 80 years, would commit South Africa to an energy source just as renewables are getting cheaper. In the past five years, production costs for solar and wind have dropped so much that the most recently approved plants, now under construction, will generate electricity at the cheapest rate in South Africa. Over the coming decades, critics of the nuclear project argue, advances in storage and other technologies will emerge even as South Africa is saddled with nuclear power. Massive nuclear plants will become outdated as national electrical grids are decentralized, critics say. Businesses in South African cities are increasingly installing solar panels, effectively going off the grid. Elsewhere in Africa, it is becoming more and more common to see villagers connecting cellphones to single solar panels outside mud-brick homes. “The concept of baseload is actually an outdated concept,” said Harald Winkler, the director of the Energy Research Center at the University of Cape Town. “Eskom was built around big coal and to a lesser extent big nuclear — big chunks of baseload power. It’s really myopic in terms of where the future of the grid is going to go. We’re going to see in South Africa and the rest of the world much more decentralized grids.” Opposition to South Africa’s nuclear plans is also coming from the government’s main research agency, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. An expansion of solar and wind energy, in addition to natural gas, could meet South Africa’s future energy needs for a cheaper price, according to a projection by the council. “No new coal, no new nuclear,” said Tobias Bischof-Niemz, who leads the council’s research on energy. “South Africa is in a very fortunate situation where we can decarbonize our energy system at negative cost.”",2016-11-14T01:27:16.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-africa

A combined company would produce enough electricity to serve nearly half the households in the United States, Exelon said. Exelon, one of the nation’s largest electric companies that covers a broad swath of the Midwest and Middle Atlantic states, combines the assets of Commonwealth Edison and Philadelphia Electric. Its unsolicited, all-stock offer for NRG is a 37 percent premium over the closing price last Friday, Exelon said. Joelle Frank, a spokeswoman for NRG, said the company had advised its shareholders to “take no action, pending review by NRG’s board of directors.” NRG has hired Citigroup and Credit Suisse to advise it, she said. The Exelon announcement notes that a change of control at NRG would require refinancing much of its debt, now at $8 billion. Exelon said one reason for the combination would be an enormous combined entity with investment-grade credit ratings and the financial strength to build new power plants. A year ago, NRG asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for permission to build two nuclear reactors at a site 90 miles southwest of Houston, the first time since the mid-1970s that anyone has sought permission for a new nuclear power plant in the country. Exelon is one of the nation’s largest and most successful nuclear operators. But the promised resurgence of nuclear power has been thrown into some doubt because of the credit crisis. In a statement, Exelon said that the merged company would have “unparalleled” diversity in geography, in four major regions. NRG has major operations in Texas, Southern California and elsewhere. The merged company would also have diversity in fuel sources, including uranium, natural gas, coal and oil, Exelon said.",2008-10-20T08:37:46.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day

The severity of the accident, which spread discernable radioactive material over Scandinavia, was not immediately clear. But the terse statement, distributed by the Tass press agency and read on the evening television news, suggested a major accident. The phrasing also suggested that the problem had not been brought under full control at the nuclear plant, which the Soviet announcement identified as the Chernobyl station. It is situated at the new town of Pripyat, near Chernobyl and 60 miles north of Kiev. Heightened Radioactivity Levels The announcement, the first official disclosure of a nuclear accident ever by the Soviet Union, came hours after Sweden, Finland and Denmark reported abnormally high radioactivity levels in their skies. The readings initially led those countries to think radioactive material had been leaking from one of their own reactors. The Soviet announcement, made on behalf of the Council of Ministers, after Sweden had demanded information, said in its entirety: ''An accident has occurred at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant as one of the reactors was damaged. Measures are being taken to eliminate the consequences of the accident. Aid is being given to those affected. A Government commission has been set up.'' Concern Is Reinforced The mention of a commission of inquiry reinforced indications that the accident was a serious one. [ United States experts said the accident probably posed no danger outside the Soviet Union. But in the absence of detailed information, they said it would be difficult to determine the gravity, and they said environmental damage might conceivably be disastrous. Page A10. [ The Chernobyl plant, with four 1,000-megawatt reactors in operation, is one of the largest and oldest of the 15 or so Soviet civilian nuclear stations. Nuclear power has been a matter of high priority in the Soviet Union, and capacity has been going into service as fast as reactors can be built. Page A10. ] Pripyat, where the Chernobyl plant is situated, is a settlement of 25,000 to 30,000 people that was built in the 1970's along with the station. It is home to construction workers, service personnel and their families. A British reporter returning from Kiev reported seeing no activity in the Ukrainian capital that would suggest any alarm. No other information was immediately available from the area. But reports from across Scandinavia, areas more than 800 miles to the north, spoke of increases in radioactivity over the last 24 hours. Scandinavian authorities said the radioactivity levels did not pose any danger, and it appeared that only tiny amounts of radioactive material had drifted over Scandinavia. All of it was believed to be in the form of two relatively innocuous gases, xenon and krypton. Scandinavian officials said the evidence pointed to an accident in the Ukraine. In Sweden, an official at the Institute for Protection Against Radiation said gamma radiation levels were 30 to 40 percent higher than normal. He said that the levels had been abnormally high for 24 hours and that the release seemed to be continuing. In Finland, officials were reported to have said readings in the central and northern areas showed levels six times higher than normal. The Norwegian radio quoted pollution control officials as having said that radioactivity in the Oslo area was 50 percent higher. Since morning, Swedish officials had focused on the Soviet Union as the probable source of the radioactive material, but Swedish Embassy officials here said the Soviet authorities had denied knowledge of any problem until the Government announcement was read on television at 9 P.M. The first alarm was raised in Sweden when workers arriving at the Forsmark nuclear power station, 60 miles north of Stockholm, set off warnings during a routine radioactivity check. The plant was evacuated, Swedish officials said. When other nuclear power plants reported similar happenings, the authorities turned their attention to the Soviet Union, from which the winds were coming. A Swedish diplomat here said he had telephoned three Soviet Government agencies - the State Committee for Utilization of Atomic Energy, the Ministry of Electric Power and the three-year-old State Committee for Safety in the Atomic Power Industry -asking them to explain the high readings over Scandinavia. All said they had no explanation, the diplomat said. Before the Soviet acknowledgment, the Swedish Minister of Energy, Birgitta Dahl, said that whoever was responsible for the spread of radioactive material was not observing international agreements requiring warnings and exchanges of information about accidents. Tass, the Soviet Government press agency, said the Chernobyl accident was the first ever in a Soviet nuclear power plant. It was the first ever acknowledged by the Russians, but Western experts have reported at least two previous mishaps. In 1957, a nuclear waste dump believed related to weapons production was reported to have resulted in a chemical reaction in the Kasli areas of the Urals, causing damage to the environment and possibly fatalities. In 1974, a steam line exploded in the Shevchenko nuclear breeder plant in Kazakhstan, but no radioactive material is believed to have been released in that accident. Soviet authorities, in giving the development of nuclear electricity generation a high priority, have said that nuclear power is safe. In the absence of citizens' opposition to nuclear power, there has been virtually no questioning of the program. The terse Soviet announcement of the Chernobyl accident was followed by a Tass dispatch noting that there had been many mishaps in the United States, ranging from Three Mile Island outside Harrisburg, Pa., to the Ginna plant near Rochester. Tass said an American antinuclear group registered 2,300 accidents, breakdowns and other faults in 1979. The practice of focusing on disasters elsewhere when one occurs in the Soviet Union is so common that after watching a report on Soviet television about a catastrophe abroad, Russians often call Western friends to find out whether something has happened in the Soviet Union. Construction of the Chernobyl plant began in the early 1970's and the first reactor was commissioned in 1977. Work has been lagging behind plans. In April 1983, the Ukrainian Central Committee chastised the Chernobyl plant, along with the Rovno nuclear power station at Kuznetsovsk, for ''inferior quality of construction and installation work and low operating levels.'' ---- U.S. Offers to Help AGANA, Guam, Tuesday, April 29 -Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff, said today that the United States was willing to provide medical and scientific assistance to the Soviet Union in connection with the nuclear accident but so far there had been no such request.

Credit... Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York Times Workers have repaired two vital external power lines at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant that are needed to power cooling systems. The repairs took two days, highlighting the precarious safety situation at the plant, the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog agency said on Saturday. The plant, with six reactors, lies on the Dnipro River, where Russian and Ukrainian forces are fighting over the Kherson Province. Russian forces control the surrounding area and the plant, but Ukrainian engineers still operate it and two U.N. inspectors are on site. Moscow and Kyiv have blamed each other for the interruptions in power. Shelling and other explosions from mines around the sprawling plant have severed the external power lines several times in recent months, forcing its engineers to rely on diesel generators and shut down reactors to avoid an accident. The lines were cut again by Russian shelling on Wednesday night, and the plant again switched to diesel power, according to Energoatom, the Ukrainian power company that operates the plant. The generators have a 15-day supply of fuel. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said his inspectors at the plant had confirmed the staff had repaired the two damaged external power lines by Friday afternoon, and by 10 p.m., power was restored to the six reactors and the generators were turned off. Still, Mr. Grossi said the repeated power outages “all too clearly demonstrate the extremely serious nuclear safety and security situation” at the plant. He repeated his call for the warring sides to establish a demilitarized zone around the reactors. “So far, the brave staff of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant have always managed to maintain the safe operation of the six units,” he said. “But it can’t go on like this.”",2022-11-06T06:03:03.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Credit... Leonhard Foeger/Reuters ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine — The gravest risk to the embattled Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is physical damage to equipment from shelling that could lead to a release of radiation, the director of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog agency said Friday after a visit to the site. Other risks abound, Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters in Vienna, a day after inspecting the nuclear station in southern Ukraine. The plant has been repeatedly hit by artillery. Loss of external power to cool reactor cores and stress on the operating staff also pose dangers, he said. “It is obvious there is a lot of fighting in general in this part of Ukraine,” Mr. Grossi said. “The military activity and operations are increasing in that part of the country, and this worries me a lot.” Mr. Grossi said two United Nations experts would remain at the plant to provide independent assessments of its safety going forward. Most of the damage from the war at the sprawling station, which is the largest nuclear plant in Europe, occurred during shelling in August, Mr. Grossi said, unless one considers the destruction from the battle in March when the Russian army captured the site. The Zaporizhzhia plant, nestled in a gentle valley of farm fields in a once sleepy and provincial corner of Ukraine that is now a site of raging battles along a front line, became this year the first active nuclear plant to be caught in a combat zone in the history of civilian nuclear power. Over all, not one of what the nuclear monitoring agency calls the seven pillars of nuclear safety, which include physical integrity, reliable external power and availability of spare parts, remains intact, Mr. Grossi said. The plant has six reactors and before the war provided 30 percent of Ukraine’s electricity. But on some points the agency’s initial assessment was more optimistic than the picture painted by Ukrainian officials, who had said that engineers and other employees had been subjected to harsh interrogation and even torture, raising stress levels when they returned to work in reactor control rooms and in other critical jobs. Mr. Grossi said he had spoken with the Ukrainian employees and that they had found a way to cooperate — what he called “cohabitation” — with the Russian soldiers and nuclear experts also at the site. “The plant continues to operate, and there is a professional modus vivendi, if I can put it that way,” he said. Before the visit, Ukrainian officials had said the agency should discount anything employees at the plant said, arguing they are essentially hostages. Mr. Grossi said the Ukrainian and Russian nuclear engineers had managed to “cope” in operating the site and that he was less worried about disruptions in regulatory oversight and supplies of spare parts, those these problems also loomed as risks. He spoke after he and a team of inspectors crossed a front line in Russia’s war in Ukraine to conduct an inspection. Their mission was delayed by artillery strikes on their planned route, part of a swirl of chaotic violence in and around the station. Mr. Grossi said his assessment was bound to disappoint both sides for declining to place blame on one or another army for the shells hitting the plant. “I don’t want to pretend what we are doing will end this terrible war or give back this plant to Ukraine,” he said. The mission was limited to gauging nuclear safety, something he said the two-man team remaining at the site would do. “Now, when there is an allegation that something has happened at the plant, you can turn to us,” he said, rather than weighing the conflicting claims of Russia and Ukraine. “That’s the difference.” He said Russian soldiers had not blocked access to areas of the site he asked to visit. Asked to compare the potential fallout from a radiation release at Zaporizhzhia with the fire and meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in 1986, which spread radiation around Europe in the world’s worst civilian nuclear accident, Mr. Grossi said designs of the two power stations are not comparable. Zaporizhzhia’s reactors have containment vessels to limit radiation release. But he said disruptions in external power to cool reactor cores could lead to a meltdown. “It could be a big thing or a small thing, depending on the damage” from the fighting, he said.",2022-09-03T00:07:46.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

The auction of the Pilgrim reactor reflected the growing attraction of nuclear plants among utilities after a prolonged period of diminished interest because of their construction costs and concerns over safety.. Just four months ago, the Unit I reactor on Three Mile Island was sold for $100 million in the first-ever sale of a nuclear plant in the United States. But unlike the auction for Pilgrim, there was only one bidder, the Amergen Energy Company, a joint venture of the Peco Energy Company and British Energy P.L.C. Ten potential buyers expressed interest in buying Pilgrim, owned by BEC Energy, the parent of the Boston Edison Company, a utility serving the Boston area. It has been disposing of its generating plants under a Massachusetts plan to open utilities to competition. Two utilities ended up submitting bids for the reactor, which produces 670 megawatts of power. That is considered small among the 104 nuclear plants operating in this country. The auction demonstrated that a group of utilities that operate large numbers of nuclear plants are now potential serious bidders to buy up other nuclear plants as some states force their utilities to spin off generation as they deregulate. Some utilities have encountered problems operating their nuclear plants efficiently, forcing them to shut the plants down for long periods and passing the high cost of buying power to customers. A few utilities have faced such severe problems with nuclear plants that they have decided to shut the plants permanently. But the vast majority of the nation's nuclear plants operate efficiently and produce some of the cheapest electricity in the nation. This is one reason why they have become a major attraction to some large utilities like Entergy, which already operates four nuclear plants. Although its headquarters are in New Orleans, it wants to become a low-cost supplier of electricity in other regions, like New England. Mr. Reed said other utilities that own only one nuclear plant are likely to sell them. He also predicted that a small number of huge utilities, like Entergy and Peco, would acquire most of nation's nuclear plantsand end up as major nationwide suppliers of nuclear power. Don Hintz, the group president of Entergy Nuclear, a subsidiary that runs Entergy's nuclear plants, said the acquisition of Pilgrim was the first of a series. ''As other nuclear plants become available, we plan to acquire some of them,'' he said. ''There is going to be a consolidation in the nuclear industry, where a few companies will own and operate all the nuclear plants in the country.'' Of the $80 million purchase price, $67 million will pay for the plant's nuclear fuel. This means the amount paid for the generating capacity works out to about $20 a kilowatt, compared with about $500 a kilowatt that has recently been paid for coal-fired plants.",1998-11-20T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business

The General Electric Company said it had been selected by the Tokyo Electric Power Company to supply the nuclear boiler systems, initial nuclear fuel and turbine-generators for two new nuclear power stations. Tokyo Electric estimated the cost of the stations, which would be built on the Sea of Japan northwest of Tokyo, at 692 billion yen, or nearly $5 billion at current exchange rates. General Electric estimated its share of the project will be more than $1 billion. The Tokyo Electric contract culminates a six-year cooperative effort by the utility, G.E., Hitachi Ltd. and the Toshiba Corporation. The agreement reflects the Japanese company's ''continuing confidence in G.E. as a key participant in their ongoing nuclear power program,'' said Bertram Wolfe, a General Electric vice president. Mr. Wolfe is chief scientist at G.E.'s nuclear systems technologies operation based in San Jose, Calif. tium saved from bankruptcy last year, will cut 1,155 jobs at its Yeovil factory in the west of England, a company spokesman said. ''We had to make capacity reductions in view of the market situation of helicopter manufacturing capacity,'' he said. Last month, the British Government said it would place an order worth $500 million with Westland. But the company has announced that it will have to cut its operations by up to a third, in spite of the order. Diablo Canyon Cost Report SAN FRANCISCO, May 14 -The California Public Utilities Commission's Public Staff division, a consumer-advocacy unit, recommended today that the Pacific Gas and Electric Company be allowed to recover from ratepayers only $1.15 billion of the $5.52 billion cost of the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. The commission can accept all, part or none of the division's recommendation in its final determination, which is not expected for at least one year. P.G.&E. dismissed the recommendation as ''misleading, ill founded and irresponsible,'' and said it would press for a public hearing so that ''the fallacies of the report can be exposed and an objective evaluation reached.'' On March 31, P.G.&E. said its continuing dispute with the commission regarding Diablo Canyon had led to an accounting change that would reduce 1987 earnings by about $470 million. Diablo Canyon, which generates 2.152 million kilowatts, has been criticized for cost overuns and construction errors. Stated in terms of cost per kilowatt, the Public Staff division recommended that the company be allowed to recover $534 per kilowatt, while the cost of construction is $2,433 per kilowatt. In comparison, the Palo Verde nuclear plant near Phoenix, cost $2,579 per kilowatt, and the commission allowed the recovery of $2,566. COMPANY NEWS",1987-05-15T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business

The United States and the Soviet Union today marked the second anniversary of the Soviet nuclear-reactor disaster at Chernobyl by signing an agreement to exchange technical and safety data on civilian nuclear-power reactors. The ''memorandum of cooperation,'' a document described as ''a subsection'' of a largely ineffective 1973 accord, was signed in a brief ceremony at the State Department by Lando W. Zech Jr., chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and Aleksandr N. Protsenko, chairman of the Soviet State Committee for the Utilization of Atomic Energy. Mr. Zech called the protocol ''a historic agreement, based on extensive discussions and preparations by our two Governments.'' But he seemed to confirm reports by other American nuclear-power officials that ''extensive discussions and preparations'' involving the Russians had been almost entirely a post-Chernobyl phenomenon. The accident took 31 lives by official count, and many experts believe that it will lead to thousands of more deaths from exposure to high levels of radiation. Two previous U.S.-Soviet agreements called for cooperation on nuclear matters. The first was a two-year accord signed in 1959. In 1973, President Nixon and Leonid I.

This fact, together with the enormous expense of constructing and decommissioning reactors, the dangers of nuclear power in an age of terrorism and the problems associated with the disposal of radioactive waste, militate against the concept of nuclear-generated electricity.

But the blaze at Vattenfall's Krümmel reactor has since become a political wildfire. Now, Germany's pro-nuclear energy politicians have gone into hiding. The event featured finger sandwiches with liverwurst and salami, a Dixieland band and Chancellor Angela Merkel telling marginally funny jokes, like the one about her not being too concerned about the southern state of Baden-Württemberg's future because its residents are capable of doing just about anything, except, of course, speak German properly. When the state's environment ministry celebrated its 20th anniversary last Wednesday in Ludwigsburg, the mood was so relaxed that the governor of Baden-Württemberg, Günther Oettinger, decided to take advantage of his guests' high spirits to deliver an important message. According to Oettinger, who belongs to Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats, nuclear energy should be part of Germany's energy mix in the future as a climate-friendly energy source. The reactors, he said, should be kept in operation longer than current plans call for -- and he is certain that the policy of shutting down Germany's nuclear power plants by 2021, passed under former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder during his coalition government with the Greens, will eventually be reversed. It was an important issue for Oettinger, whose state derives more than half of its electricity from nuclear power plants -- a rate almost twice as high as in Germany as a whole. But his audience was not convinced. Indeed, Oettinger's comments received no applause, nor even a few nods of approval. The Baden-Württemberg governor, it seemed, was giving his speech in the wrong place and at the wrong time. 'Occasional Explosion or Fire' Nuclear power has received a tremendous boost since climate change has made Germans suddenly fearful about the future. Regional politicians like Oettinger, Roland Koch of Hesse and Edmund Stoiber of Bavaria, as well as CDU General Secretary Ronald Pofalla, have become increasingly vocal proponents of extending the shelf life of nuclear power plants. But during the last two weeks or so, amid thick clouds of smoke enveloping a nuclear power plant in Krümmel and reports of technical failures, human error and corporate incompetence, opponents of nuclear power see their arguments gaining credence once again. Suddenly the Social Democrats, especially Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel, see themselves justified in taking the position that nuclear energy is a ""risky technology."" ""German nuclear power plants are the safest worldwide,"" Gabriel said acerbically last week, ""aside from the occasional explosion or fire."" Not only has Gabriel recognized an opportunity to shift public opinion away from nuclear power, he is also clearly aware of the issue's symbolic importance. By defending the movement to phase out the technology in Germany, Gabriel has assumed the role of the protector of the Schröder government's legacy. Of course, the issue also revolves around emotions, history and the right to interpret history. Was the battle against nuclear power wrong? Was the decision to phase out the technology a historical mistake, as the conservatives claim? Was it in fact an environmental mistake? Or was the decision to abandon the dangerous technology the right one, because it is in fact so difficult to control, as the Greens and Social Democrats argue? Since the two most recent incidents-- at the reactors in Krümmel and Brunsbüttel -- became public at the beginning of the month, Gabriel has positioned himself as a leading critic of Vattenfall, the company that operates the two stricken reactors. And he has been demanding answers. Gabriel's posturing is the type that even a few short weeks ago would have triggered automatic retorts from conservatives. But last week there was hardly a whimper from even the staunchest proponents of nuclear power. Economics Minister Michael Glos (CDU) told a small group: ""One hardly even dares take a position anymore."" Dietrich Austermann (CDU), the minister of economics for the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, an advocate of extending plant operating licenses, admitted that the incident at Krümmel has weighed heavily on the debate. Proved to Be a Lie The reason for the change in thinking is clear. Whereas most of the some 130 reactor incidents reported annually in Germany are minor and go unnoticed, smoke pouring out of a transformer as happened in Krümmel tends to attract attention. It took the fire department hours to extinguish the blaze. Even worse, the plant operator's claim that a fire in the transformer had no effect on the reactor itself proved to be a lie. In short, the incident has made it clear that nuclear energy is by no means the modern, well-organized high-tech sector portrayed until recently by politicians and industry advocates. Indeed, the frequency of problems occurring at Germany's aging reactors is on the rise. Just as old cars will eventually succumb to rust, the country's nuclear power plants, built in the 1970s and 80s, are undergoing a natural aging process. The problems are complicated by maintenance and supervision issues among aging and unmotivated employees. A dangerously lackadaisical attitude has taken hold that is making Germany's nuclear power plants increasingly unsafe. Most incidents to date have proven to be relatively minor, and yet each new incident becomes yet another link in a chain of problems with the potential to end in a serious accident. As if the nuclear industry weren't facing enough problems with the recent incidents, representatives of the district attorney's office in the northern city of Lübeck took matters into their own hands last Friday when they appeared at Krümmel plant to get a clear answer on who exactly is responsible for operations at the plant. Vattenfall, the plant's owner, had refused to promptly provide the district attorney with the relevant information. Uwe Döring, the justice minister in the state of Schleswig-Holstein, said that he was ""speechless"" over Vattenfall's response, ""especially coming from a company fighting to preserve its credibility."" Ignited Several Tons of Transformer Oil With Vattenfall coming under growing pressure, company executives last week were even considering a plan to transfer the operating licenses for its two nuclear reactors to E.on, which is both a partner and a competitor. The executives reason that because the Düsseldorf-based energy giant, which owns 50 percent of the Krümmel reactor and 33 percent of the Brunsbüttel plant, has a better reputation when it comes to operating nuclear reactors, an E.on takeover would help prevent the plants from being shut down. The two companies have already entered into serious talks over the plan, but E.on plans to wait until the incidents at Krümmel have been fully investigated before reaching a decision. According to the initial report issued by Vattenfall Europe, Germany's third-largest energy utility, a phenomenon known as arcing caused a fire at 3:02 p.m. on June 29. The fire ignited several tons of transformer oil, which normally circles around the voltage transformer in sealed metal pipes, cooling the transformer. According to a statement issued the same day by the head of the nuclear division of Vattenfall's German subsidiary, Bruno Thomauske, the problem was under control and the safety of the local population was not endangered ""at any time."" But the public learned more and more about further deficiencies at the plant in the ensuing days. ""One has the feeling,"" Minister of the Environment Gabriel said derisively, ""that someone from Greenpeace is doing their PR."" Vattenfall has now come under increased scrutiny. ""We are taking a careful look at what's happening in Germany,"" says Peter Rickwood, a spokesman of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). After an incident at the Forsmark nuclear power plant in Sweden last year, in which two backup generators broke down and the reactor had to be operated ""flying blind"" for 20 minutes, Vattenfall submitted a report to the IAEA that clearly glossed over the seriousness of the situation. The same pattern seems to have emerged in the Krümmel incident, as well as at the Brunsbüttel plant, where the reactor was temporarily shut down because of a ""network problem."" In both cases Vattenfall's report assigns the lowest problem classification -- ""N"" for normal -- to the incidents. This blatant effort to downplay problems at the reactors has even led to ill will against Vattenfall management among employees. ""Our people working in the nuclear power plant are not permitted to say anything, but they are furious,"" says Uwe Martens, the managing director of the Hamburg branch of the services union Ver.di. Indeed, Thomauske chose to blame others at the lower end of the hierarchy for the Krümmel incident. According to Thomauske, a ""misunderstanding"" between the reactor manager and the shift manager led to the inadvertent opening of valves. Another unanswered question is why up to 25 people were congregated in the reactor's operating room at the time of the accident. Over the weekend, Vattenfall management finally began taking responsibility for the management meltdown. And on Monday, Thomauske was fired along with company spokesman Johannes Altmeppen. The decision was made at the headquarters of Vattenfall's German subsidiary in Berlin in conjunction with the mothership back in Stockholm. Acting Irresponsibly But the move might have come too late. Gitta Trauernicht, the Schleswig-Holstein minister for social affairs, has clearly distanced herself from Vattenfall. ""What happened here is a first in the history of the nuclear industry,"" said Trauernicht, whose agency is investigating Vattenfall and the reliability of its operations. Trauernicht has said she would not hesitate to withdraw Vattenfall's license to operate nuclear power plants if it became clear that the company was acting at all irresponsibly. Even Vattenfall's competitors say that they are concerned about the way the Krümmel incident was handled. Officially the utilities have complained to government officials in Berlin that the mishaps could discredit the entire nuclear industry. But unofficially they have reproached Vattenfall for serious deficiencies in its ability to manage a crisis like the one that happened at Krümmel. Public relations officials in the nuclear industry traditionally meet once a year to discuss strategy. In the mid-1990s, this group agreed on a plan to deal with crisis situations. It called for being upfront with the public and responding clearly and quickly, mainly to prevent rumors from developing, but also to demonstrate the industry's proactive approach to such problems. Apparently only a few German companies -- and Vattenfall -- have failed to implement the plan. When the Krümmel incident occurred, Vattenfall reacted as it would have in the 1980s: provide as little information as possible, admit only what can no longer be denied and downplay the facts. Just why the company chose cover-up over clearing up is unclear. Vattenfall cannot exactly claim that its PR policies are based on a lack of experience. Safety issues have become an all-too-common occurrence in plants run by the company. An internal report by Forsmark, a Swedish power plant operator and subsidiary of Vattenfall, reveals why this is the case. According to the report, which is unsparing in its criticism of Vattenfall, there has been a ""decline in the safety culture"" at the company. Vattenfall's ""focus on increasing production"" and its ""too rapid renovation of plants"" have led to many ""unacceptable quality defects."" In addition, when Forsmark alcohol-tested 25 people who were involved in its audit at the plant, which is located about 200 kilometers north of Stockholm, three had to be sent home. Problems the Rule Rather than the Exception Some of these problems are attributable to constant repairs at the plants, repairs that are also long overdue at German nuclear power plants. In a 55-page report, Germany's Reactor Safety Commission (RSC), which advises Gabriel's environment ministry, writes about ""containing the aging processes"" and that some age-related problems are only being discovered by chance. According to the RSC, these problems are difficult to correct, partly because ""suppliers and manufacturers are no longer in business."" The 31-year-old Neckarwestheim I reactor -- along with the Biblis A reactor, Germany's oldest reactor still in operation -- is one of a group of nuclear dinosaurs where problems have become the rule rather than the exception. When a fire broke out in a major incident in October 2005, the reactor had to be shut down manually. The state environment ministry in Stuttgart had imposed a €25,000 fine on the plant's operator shortly before the incident. It had taken the operator, EnBW, about 20 days to discover a leak of radioactively contaminated water into the Neckar River, and another nine days to report the problem. For years the Philippsburg 2 nuclear power plant, which went online in 1984, was repeatedly started up again after maintenance work and shutdowns without the emergency cooling system being correctly filled. Nevertheless, a court in the state of Baden-Württemberg, where Philippsburg is located, turned down a request by the state government for tightened safety regulations as being ""too vague."" Problems at the Biblis A power plant reveal how inadequate work has been on aging reactors. The plant's operator, utility giant RWE, insists that it has invested about €1.2 billion in refurbishing the plant's A and B units in the past eight years. Nevertheless, Biblis A retains the dubious reputation of being a ""junkyard reactor."" For decades inspectors have failed to notice serious maintenance deficiencies. It wasn't until 2003 that an inspection engineer hit upon the idea of measuring the opening size of one of the reactor's backup cooling systems. As a result of the test, the reactor was shut down for eight months and authorities demanded a complete overhaul of the approval process. But even when it came to the many improvements to the reactor, both the operator and supervisory authorities revealed a lack of the necessary attention to detail. During a walk-through last September, inspectors discovered small concrete fragments on the floor of the reactor building. A subsequent inspection revealed that more than half of about 15,000 heavy dowels installed in 2001 to safeguard central plant components in both Biblis reactors against earthquakes had in fact been installed incorrectly and were not as strong as required. In addition, the Biblis reactors are virtually unprotected against terrorist attacks from the air, even though they are located only a few flight minutes from Germany's busiest airport in Frankfurt. The concrete containment shell of reactor A is less than 60 centimeters thick, a problem also encountered at two other aging plants, Brunsbüttel and Philippsburg 1. Experts believe that the risks posed by plant personnel even outweigh those of an airborne terrorist attack. Employees who have spent years staring at the plants' security monitors without experiencing a major incident are bound to acquire a false sense of security, which ultimately leads to a more lax approach to safety precautions. In 1987 this phenomenon resulted, at the Biblis A nuclear power plant, in what until then was the most serious incident in the history of German nuclear power. For hours the team in the control booth ignored a warning light indicating an open valve in the cooling cycle. ""Working in a nuclear power plant is incredibly boring, but you still have to be completely on the ball,"" says Michael Sailer of the Darmstadt-based RSC. ""Sloppiness is dangerous."" Another factor complicating the problem is the aging of workers at nuclear power plants. Operators are having trouble recruiting new employees. Nuclear power plants are ""simply no longer sexy,"" says Jef Vanwildemeersch, a former Belgian government official and now a nuclear industry lobbyist. In the mid-1980s there were about 300 students learning the nuclear power business in Germany. By 2006 that number had plunged to only about 20, half of them coming from abroad. Insiders also report a lack of motivation among employees. The work ethic has suffered as a result of cost-cutting measures, job cuts and outsourcing. According to Uwe Möller, a lecturer at the Essen Power Plant School, ""the mood is somber at a few power plants because many are focused on the time they have left until retirement."" Because of personnel shortfalls, some companies are bringing early retirees and pensioners back to work to ensure continued operation. Utilities E.on and RWE say they are already spending ""millions"" to train new employees internally. Nevertheless, internal criticism of the industry and its current state remains a taboo. Eberhard Grauf, the former director of the Neckarwestheim II nuclear power plant, was abruptly dismissed in July 2004. Grauf, a professional with an international reputation, had previously complained about ""unacceptable work loads"" at the plant operated by energy giant EnBW. Overloading the Transformer Industry insiders complain that for some time power plant operators have been attempting to squeeze as much profit as possible out of their old, and for the most part depreciated, reactors. In recent years, for example, the owners of the Krümmel nuclear power plant have invested about €50 million in technical improvements to increase the efficiency of the plant's turbines, a move that has brought a 7 percent improvement in net output. But these alleged improvements have also increased stress on secondary systems such as the plant's transformer, systems that were apparently not retrofitted. In fact, this may have been the cause of the Krümmel fire. According to Günther Pikos, a nuclear expert from the western German city of Düren, ""the transformer was apparently already damaged by a string of earlier incidents."" Pikos believes that this, combined with the increase in turbine output, was what ended up overloading the transformer. E.on has also asked the Bavarian state government for its approval of a similar efficiency upgrade at its Gundremmingen nuclear power plant. Raimund Kamm of the Forum for a Responsible Energy Policy is concerned about the upgrade: ""It's the same situation as when you're upping a car's performance. The engine becomes more powerful, while the brakes stay the same."" Minister of the Environment Gabriel is familiar with these risks. But he is equally alarmed over scenarios that extend into the political arena. He and fellow members of his party are becoming increasingly concerned that the operators of aging nuclear power plants will take advantage of the current mood to attempt to push through a program that could only be to their benefit. By agreeing to shut down trouble-prone reactors prematurely and transfer their operating licenses to newer reactors, companies could extend the operating life of the newer reactors by five to 10 years. This sort of maneuver would put pressure on politicians, especially Social Democrats. One of them, Gabriel, will soon have a chance to demonstrate how strong his support is for unconditionally abandoning nuclear power. This week he is scheduled to meet with Klaus Rauscher, the head of Vattenfall Europe.",2007-07-17T14:41:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

Credit... David Guttenfelder for The New York Times International nuclear inspectors reported significant damage from weekend shelling at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant but found key equipment intact and “no immediate nuclear safety or security concerns,” the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog said on Monday. Even so, the scope of the damage “is a major cause of concern as it clearly demonstrates the sheer intensity of the attacks on one of the world’s largest nuclear power plants,” Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director of the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency, said in a statement. Russian forces have for months occupied the Zaporizhzhia complex — the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe — while Ukrainian engineers continue to run it. Intense shelling has repeatedly caused damage at the site, raising fears of a possible meltdown. The most disruptive strikes have damaged external power lines supplying the reactor cooling systems, forcing the plant’s operators to sometimes rely on diesel generators as a last resort. Russia and Ukraine have each blamed the other for the attacks. They did the same on Monday, after a dozen shells exploded near the Zaporizhzhia complex over the weekend. A team of four inspectors that visited the plant on Monday reported no new damage to the outside power lines, but observed fresh damage including to storage tanks and the main road running along the plant’s reactors, the I.A.E.A. said. As in past episodes of shelling on the plant, the agency made no mention of which country had been responsible. Mr. Grossi has warned of the urgent need to safeguard complex. “Until we have this plant protected, the possibility of the nuclear catastrophe is there,” he said in an interview with CBS News on “60 Minutes” that aired on Sunday. In particular, Mr. Grossi cited the reliance on diesel generators as an unsustainable practice. “Because when your generators are out of whatever you put in it to make them work, then what happens? Then you have a meltdown.” In October, Mr. Grossi spoke with both President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, hoping to get both sides to agree to establishing a demilitarized zone around Zaporizhzhia. He has been calling for similar measures since leading a team of inspectors to the facility in August. No agreement has been reached. In his nightly address, Mr. Zelensky said he was working toward implementing an I.A.E.A request to “stop any hostile activity” against Ukrainian nuclear plants, but said the “demilitarization” of the plant was paramount in that effort. “Russia must withdraw all its militants from there and stop shelling the station,” he said. A spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, blamed Kyiv for the strikes, saying Ukraine continued to “play with fire,” according to the Russian state news outlet RIA. Image Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, after visiting the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in September. Credit... Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times In recent weeks, Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukrainian infrastructure, including an assault involving roughly 100 missiles last week that was one of the biggest and broadest attacks since the start of the war in February. Ukrainian forces shot down most of the missiles, but some still struck key energy infrastructure, plunging nearly a quarter of the country into darkness. Before the war, nuclear plants supplied a large share of Ukraine’s power. In the past month Russia expanded its attacks on Ukrainian nuclear facilities, targeting the Khmelnytskyi plant in western Ukraine and forcing it to switch to diesel generators for several hours. A second nuclear power plant in the nearby province of Rivne was forced to reduce the energy it produced after power lines were damaged. The reactors at the Zaporizhzhia power plant have been shut down since September as a safety measure. While a direct military strike on one of the reactor cores could still trigger an accident, the risk is greatly reduced if the plant is not in full operation. Four of the complex’s six reactors are in cold shutdown, the I.A.E.A. said senior managers there had confirmed on Monday, and the other two are in “hot shutdown” — meaning they produce thermal energy but not electricity. The thermal energy allows steam and hot water to be provided to the complex itself and to the nearby city of Enerhodar, where many of the plant’s workers live.",2022-11-22T17:42:37.000+01:00,NYTIMES,world

But judging by the warnings of the electricity company here in the world's largest city, this will be a summer unlike all others, with severe power shortages and even blackouts predicted. Industry officials hedge these alarming forecasts with one big ''if.'' The Tokyo Electric Power Company, or Tepco, says it will be able to keep its 43 million customers' tempers from boiling over only if it is allowed to press 16 nuclear power plants back into operation. The plants were temporarily taken out of service last year after a scandal over falsified inspections and poor maintenance. The latest crisis in a long-running series of public relations and safety disasters for Japan's nuclear power industry began last fall, when cracks were discovered in the containment vessels of several nuclear reactors. Under the glaring eye of an angry public, numerous other embarrassing facts were soon being unearthed. It was found that engineers had been routinely falsifying repair records, including those for one of the several Tepco plants in Fukushima, where a serious leak of radioactive liquids was hushed up. To regain the confidence of residents of areas near nuclear reactors, and perhaps to ward off tighter government regulation, the company closed 16 of its 17 atomic plants until thorough inspections and repairs could be performed. ''We clearly mishandled the situation,'' said Hiro Hasegawa, the company's deputy manager for corporate communications. ''We falsified things and mishandled the leakage. It was really terrible.'' For all of the recent contrition, however, citizen groups and antinuclear activists say the electricity industry is trying to pull another fast one. They say the company is playing on the fears of residents of a city that is one of the world's most densely inhabited and has a summer climate to match Atlanta's for mugginess. ''This is just an excuse for Tepco to resume operation of its atomic plants,'' said Kazuyoshi Sato, the leader of an antinuclear group in Fukushima, a city nearly 200 miles north of Tokyo. ''Even without the nuclear plants, Tepco will have 58 million kilowatts of capacity. They say the demand will be 64 million kilowatts, but in most years the peak has been about 59 million kilowatts.'' Recently, Mr. Sato, and other opponents of nuclear power have begun to use distinctly American-sounding ''not in my backyard'' arguments, noting that almost all of the company's reactors are located in distant towns, far outside the company's Tokyo service area. ''They may be able to manipulate consumers in the Tokyo area, but this is still a big scandal here in Fukushima,'' Mr. Sato said. ''We don't get our electricity from Tepco, so we think it's time for people in Tokyo to begin making some sacrifices.'' The power company, of course, paints a very different picture with its supply-and-demand data, and says that unless at least 10 of its suspended reactors come back online before the hottest days of summer, there will be a crisis. ''It will be very difficult -- no, I should say impossible -- to meet demand,'' said the company spokesman, Mr. Hasegawa. For now, the company is urging consumers to think creatively about conservation. The advice has run from the obvious -- run air conditioners as little as possible -- to the arcane. In a country where many people have electrical toilets with heated seats, fancy jets for rinsing and fans for drying, the power company is urging people to keep the lids down when not in use. Analysts say that the most important effect of the current crisis will be to deliver another stout -- and perhaps even decisive -- blow to a nuclear power industry riddled with profound safety and cost problems. Just as Japan's economy has been ever so gradually inching toward reform, the country has been slowly edging toward reconsidering its use of nuclear power. This is likely to result in less emphasis on nuclear energy as source of electricity in the future, and certainly less of what critics say have been exorbitant, pie-in-the-sky schemes to develop exotic new generators. ''There is almost an emerging realization that increasing the number of nuclear plants is almost impossible,'' said Tatsuo Hatta, a professor of urban economics at Tokyo University. ''People felt until a year or so ago that maintaining the current nuclear capacity was necessary in order to maintain the price of power at reasonable levels,'' Professor Hatta said. ''But given all the recent incidents, even this is now in question.''",2003-04-13T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

Russian forces have for months occupied the Zaporizhzhia complex — the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe — while Ukrainian engineers continue to run it. Intense shelling has repeatedly caused damage at the site, raising fears of a possible meltdown. The most disruptive strikes have damaged external power lines supplying the reactor cooling systems, forcing the plant’s operators to sometimes rely on diesel generators as a last resort. Russia and Ukraine have each blamed the other for the attacks.

The move is intended to air out the building that houses Reactor No. 1 to ensure that radiation levels are low enough to allow workers to enter. The plant’s operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, said the procedure would release little radiation into the atmosphere because an air filtering system installed last week had already removed most of the dangerous particles. Eight hours after the doors were opened, workers entered the building to test radiation levels. The next step is to begin replacing the reactor’s cooling system, which was destroyed by the tsunami on March 11. The company has said it will take at least six months to stabilize the plant, in which three of the six reactors were damaged by a magnitude-9.0 earthquake and tsunami. Hydrogen explosions spewed radiation into the atmosphere, causing the worst nuclear disaster since the 1986 Chernobyl accident in Ukraine. Despite the crisis in Japan, Mr. Kan indicated Sunday that his government was not rethinking the nation’s energy policy. There had been speculation that the government might seek to shut down more nuclear plants after Mr. Kan requested last week that the Hamaoka nuclear plant in central Japan be temporarily closed because of safety concerns. Mr. Kan told reporters on Sunday that he would not seek to close any more of Japan’s 54 nuclear reactors. He said the Hamaoka plant, 125 miles west of Tokyo, was “a special case” because it sat atop a major fault line. Government seismologists say there is an almost 90 percent chance of a major earthquake on the fault line within the next 30 years. Critics have long warned of a possible accident at the Hamaoka plant, which is upwind of Tokyo. Mr. Kan asked that the plant be closed until a tsunami-resistant wall could be built and backup systems could be installed to strengthen the plant against earthquakes. The Hamaoka plant’s operator, the Chubu Electric Power Company, is expected to accept the prime minister’s request. The company’s board is scheduled to meet Monday to consider the request. It did not reach a decision at a meeting on Saturday, when some board members expressed concern about summer power shortages if the plant were shut down. The utility company supplies power to central Japan, including Aichi Prefecture, the home of Toyota. In Tokyo, residents face the prospect of electricity shortages because of the loss of the power supplied by Fukushima Daiichi and other plants in earthquake-damaged northern Japan. Despite the setbacks, Yoshito Sengoku, the deputy chief cabinet secretary, said Japan was not reconsidering its dependence on nuclear power, which supplies about a quarter of the nation’s electricity.",2011-05-08T19:21:46.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The reversal was the latest indication of how public distrust could hold back China’s ambitious plans for expanding its nuclear power industry. The government of Lianyungang, a city near the coast of Jiangsu Province, announced the retreat in a terse message online . “The people’s government of Lianyungang has decided to suspend preliminary work for selecting a site for the nuclear cycle project,” it read, referring to a proposed plant for reprocessing used fuel from nuclear plants. No reason was given, but it appeared clear enough. In recent days, residents have taken to the streets to oppose any decision to build the plant nearby. The main urban area of Lianyungang is just 20 miles southwest of a large and growing nuclear power plant on the coast, but the idea of a nuclear fuel reprocessing facility also being built in the area seemed to push public unease to a new height. A 21-year-old Lianyungang resident with the surname Tang said Wednesday that demonstrators had been chanting “Oppose nuclear waste, defend our home.” Like other people contacted there, she did not want her full name used, citing fear of reprisal for talking to reporters. “Nobody wants this kind of thing built in their own home,” Ms. Tang said. China’s authoritarian leaders are wary of local protests escalating into broader challenges to their power. But local governments have often given ground in the face of growing public opposition to chemical plants, waste incinerators and other potential sources of pollution. Now proposed nuclear projects are also becoming increasingly troublesome. “While the Chinese government does not hesitate to arrest the few political dissidents, it spends more time and energy to appease public demands,” Wenfang Tang, a professor of political science at the University of Iowa, who studies public opinion and politics in China, said in emailed comments. “The high level of government sensitivity and responsiveness to public opinion further encourages political activism in Chinese society,” Professor Tang said. “The louder you are, the more quickly the government will respond.” In Lianyungang and across China, the nuclear calamity in Fukushima, Japan, in 2011 has hardened public wariness of nuclear power, although the government argues that expanding the industry is essential for weaning the economy off coal, with all of its dangerous pollutants. The biggest protest in Lianyungang took place on Saturday, when many thousands of people, including families with children, marched through the downtown area. Despite warnings from the government, protests continued on a smaller scale this week, as residents defied ranks of riot officers with shields, according to news reports and video that people shared through social media. “I told my daughter that she must go to this protest,” one resident said, according to Sixth Tone , an English-language news website based in Shanghai. “With every extra person, the momentum will get bigger.” The announcement does not mean the nuclear fuel-reprocessing proposal is dead. The project is a collaboration between the China National Nuclear Corporation and a French company, Areva, and it has high-level government support , although no final agreement to build it has been signed. Five other Chinese provinces are under consideration for the initiative, and Lianyungang could lift its suspension. The two companies have said that they want to start building in 2020 and finish by 2030. But in China, suspensions of contentious projects have a way of quietly turning into permanent cancellations, and Lianyungang appears likely to follow that pattern. The big question now will be whether public opposition coalesces in the five other areas under consideration. All but one — Gansu Province in the northwest — is a heavily populated coastal province. Gansu is already home to China’s first civilian nuclear reprocessing plant, a small facility that has been held back by technical problems . In 2013, officials jettisoned plans for a nuclear fuel fabrication plant in the southern province of Guangdong after protests. Preliminary proposals to build nuclear power plants inland have also ignited intense opposition. The Chinese government has said that as it expands its fleet of nuclear power plants, it needs a plant for reprocessing spent fuel, a practice that separates unused plutonium and some uranium from waste. That unused material could be used to generate power, but critics have warned that the plutonium could be deployed for weapons. Japan has also built a full-scale reprocessing plant, but it has not started up yet. On Chinese social media, and even on news websites, commentators said that the contention in Lianyungang showed that the public should have a bigger say in nuclear energy planning. “In just a few days, the official stand of Lianyungang has undergone a sea change,” read a comment on Sohu.com, a Chinese news website. “Don’t underestimate just how determined the public is in opposition to nuclear waste, which is far more dangerous than wastewater from any paper pulp mill.”",2016-08-10T15:01:25.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

But far less visibly, the Obama administration has been mounting a country-by-country campaign to go beyond the treaty and ensure that Iran’s push toward atomic mastery does not ignite a regional nuclear arms race. In recent months, diplomats have been holding meetings in Washington and shuttling to the Middle East in pursuit of agreements that will let countries develop nuclear power while relinquishing the right to make atomic fuel that could be turned into bombs. Since the 189 signatories of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty last gathered in New York five years ago, many of the world’s oil-rich nations have begun thinking about or ordering nuclear power plants, arguing that the reserves that made them rich will not last forever. But the United States worries that their fear of an Iranian bomb could lead them to use the same nuclear-fuel technology to develop weapons of their own. The American strategy, begun during the Bush administration, is to pre-empt that possibility. “We think that’s the right formula for the Middle East,” Ellen Tauscher, undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, said in an interview on Friday. Late last year, the Obama administration closed the first deal, with the United Arab Emirates, which is preparing to build a $20 billion reactor complex on its Persian Gulf coast. Diplomats are negotiating similar agreements with Jordan and Bahrain and have the outlines of a deal with Saudi Arabia. Most everyone, including President Obama’s aides, agrees that the United Nations conference will not fix the glaring weaknesses in the nonproliferation treaty, which have let Iran move to the edge of a nuclear-weapons capability. Rewriting the treaty is “harder than changing the U.S. Constitution,” Gary Samore, Mr. Obama’s top adviser on nuclear arms, said last week. Instead, the administration is trying to entice Middle Eastern states out of enriching uranium for reactor fuel and later scavenging spent fuel for plutonium, a step known as reprocessing. Both are allowed by the treaty, and both can become clandestine means of making atom-bomb fuel. Instead, the countries would buy the fuel from international suppliers, reducing the chance of conversion to bomb-grade material. “The less enrichment and reprocessing the better,” Ms. Tauscher said. David A. Kay, a nuclear specialist who led the fruitless search for unconventional arms in Iraq, applauded the strategy. “It’s an attempt to close up the holes in the N.P.T.,” he said in an interview. “Equally, if not more so, it’s an attempt to isolate the Iranians.” Iran and some other nations at the United Nations conference, including Egypt, have a different agenda: to force the region’s one nuclear-weapons state, Israel, to acknowledge its atomic arsenal and sign on to the nonproliferation treaty. Egypt has championed a proposal to make the Middle East a zone free of nuclear arms, a goal that the Obama administration says it supports, but only in the context of a broader regional peace. Egypt, which has announced plans for several nuclear power reactors, is pressing for a conference on the nuclear-free zone next year. Its president, Hosni Mubarak, has spoken out bluntly about the alternatives, implying that his country might feel the need to develop nuclear weapons. “We don’t want nuclear arms in the area, but we are obligated to defense ourselves,” he said in 2007 after discussing the Iranian nuclear program with Israel’s prime minister then, Ehud Olmert. “We will have to have the appropriate weapons.” Today, of the world’s 430 operating nuclear power reactors, none are in the Middle East. One reason is that the area’s oil reserves led many countries to consider nuclear power superfluous. But there is another reason: when countries began to build reactors, suspicions ran so high that they usually got bombed. In 1981, Israeli jets bombed an Iraqi reactor at Osirak. Twenty-six years later, in September 2007, they destroyed a reactor secretly under construction in Syria. In both cases, Israel feared the purpose of the reactors was to produce plutonium that could fuel bombs. But Israel was not alone. During the Iran-Iraq war in the mid-1980s, Saddam Hussein repeatedly ordered the bombing of an Iranian reactor project at Bushehr. Later, Iraq also fired missiles at a reactor that Israel built in the 1950s at Dimona to make plutonium for warheads. The Iraqi missiles missed. Only now is Iran preparing to switch on a reactor at Bushehr. Under an agreement worked out during the Bush administration, Russia is providing the fuel, and all the spent fuel is to be shipped back to Russia. Few believe Bushehr will provide Iran a path to a bomb, as long as the deal with Russia remains in force. But beyond Bushehr, the history of Iran’s nuclear program underscores the weaknesses of the nonproliferation treaty. It also explains the rationale behind the American effort to persuade countries to renounce the making of atomic fuel. While the treaty puts no limits on the making of atomic fuel, it requires countries to forswear all military goals and submit to a range of international inspections. Cheating, though, has proved difficult to detect and almost impossible to punish. What has provoked demands for Iran to halt enrichment — along with three rounds of United Nations sanctions and the threat of another — is its history of deception and continuing refusal to answer central questions about its nuclear program. Iran is enriching uranium at two plants at Natanz, is building a third near the city of Qum and has announced its intention to build 10 more. Iran says it needs them to fuel 20 future reactors. It would be far cheaper, though, for Iran to buy the fuel on open markets. Iran has also admitted to experiments in reprocessing and scavenging plutonium. Its intent, it says, is not to make weapons but to acquire radioisotopes for nuclear medicine. For these and other reasons, many of Iran’s Arab neighbors, along with Israel and the West, believe that its true goal is having a weapons ability. And so to many analysts, the growing interest among Persian Gulf nations for nuclear programs reflects a desire for a military edge. Still, there is another motivating factor: the economics of oil. When prices are high, gulf countries would prefer to sell their oil at great profit rather than burn it for power. A study done by the International Atomic Energy Agency and a group of gulf states concluded that nuclear power made sense for the region when the price of oil exceeded $50 a barrel. Today it is above $80, and with the world economy gradually recovering, many expect it to go higher. Every country in the region except Lebanon is planning to build nuclear reactors or has declared an interest in doing so. This year, Turkey signed deals with Russia and South Korea for preliminary studies of a complex on the Black Sea and another on the Mediterranean, with total power of up to 10,000 megawatts — equal to 10 large reactors. Last month Jordan announced a competition between three bidders for a 1,100-megawatt reactor. And Saudi Arabia announced the establishment of an atomic city, named after the king, to promote nuclear power. The gulf nation furthest down the atomic road — and the one that the United States calls the “gold standard” for nonproliferation — is the United Arab Emirates. In April 2008, the Emirates signed a tentative agreement with the Bush administration to give up enrichment and reprocessing in exchange for access to the global market in nuclear technologies. A year later, the Emirates signed an accord that gave the International Atomic Energy Agency the right to search nuclear-related facilities throughout the country. Iran has withdrawn its agreement to the same accord. The Obama White House endorsed the Bush administration accord and sent it to Congress, which approved it last summer. On Dec. 17, the Emirates and the United States signed an agreement that made it legal to sell advanced nuclear technology to the country. Ten days later, the Emirates awarded a South Korean company the contract to build four 1,400-megawatt reactors — quite large by industry standards. They are to begin making power between 2017 and 2020. The reactors are to be hardened against military and terrorist strikes. The Emirates has said nothing publicly, though, about whether it plans to set up antiaircraft or antimissile batteries, as Israel has done around its Dimona reactor and Iran around Bushehr. The Obama administration has been taking its case to academics and other Middle East specialists. In January, Ms. Tauscher spoke at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. And in March, the deputy energy secretary, Daniel B. Poneman, told the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, “As countries in the Middle East look at developing civil nuclear programs, the United States can promote the highest standards for safety, security and nonproliferation.”",2010-05-03T03:25:27.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world

In the age of micro everything, of getting the most out of the smallest, solar energy is the smallest amount of power from the largest amount of space -- and that only in a few Western states, in the daylight hours, when the sun is shining. Actually, nuclear power is the most powerful, abundant, cleanest, safest and non-polluting form of energy available today. Power designs are now far safer and more economical. These new nuclear designs also minimize the nuclear waste issue.

It shouldn’t have been. If the proposal is approved by the state’s Public Utilities Commission, California’s carbon dioxide emissions will either increase or decline far less than if Diablo Canyon’s two reactors, which generated about 9 percent of the state’s electricity last year, remained in operation. If this deal goes through, California will become a model of how not to deal with climate change. While Pacific Gas & Electric asserts Diablo Canyon would be replaced with other forms of clean, low-carbon power, nothing in the proposal would require the company to go that far. Instead, the plan, according to my organization’s calculations, would require the company only to invest in energy efficiency and renewables programs equivalent to about one-fifth of Diablo Canyon’s electricity output. Anything beyond that would be voluntary. Nearly every time a nuclear plant has been closed, its energy production has been replaced almost entirely with fossil fuels, including in California. In 2012, when the San Onofre nuclear plant closed, natural gas became the main replacement power source , creating emissions of carbon dioxide equivalent to putting two million cars on the road. Indeed, the energy market research organization PIRA found that natural gas use could rise by 34 percent in northern California from 2023 to 2026, the year after Diablo Canyon would be completely closed, even when taking into account the company’s renewable-energy goals . Diablo Canyon is essentially being forced to close by state renewable energy policies that discriminate against nuclear power. The state wants Pacific Gas & Electric to generate 50 percent of its power from renewables, a category specifically defined to exclude nuclear power, even though nuclear energy produces electricity with no more carbon emissions than solar, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. But California already has more solar power than it can use. This is one of the justifications given for closing Diablo Canyon. On sunny days, California solar farms have had to shut down, lest their added generation overwhelm the grid. If Diablo Canyon closes, the company will still need to provide electricity, but from other fuel sources — most likely, natural gas — when the sun goes down and demand for electricity rises. California policy makers and environmentalists have insisted that both problems — too much electricity when it isn’t needed and too little when it is — would be solved by linking California’s grid to other states’, or through breakthroughs in battery storage, but neither has come to pass. California was instead forced to store large amounts of natural gas as a backup. The risks of this approach became obvious last October when a huge natural gas storage plant near Los Angeles sprang a leak , forcing thousands to flee their homes. The escaped gas produced the emissions equivalent of adding hundreds of thousands of cars to the road for a year, and the loss of this backup power source led state officials to warn that there could be power failures this summer. If Diablo Canyon is closed, California’s dependence on natural gas is likely to become dangerously high. The share of power that California generated in-state from natural gas rose to 60 percent, from 45 percent, between 2011 and 2015, partly because of the closing of the San Onofre nuclear plant, and could easily rise further without Diablo Canyon. Environmental groups insist more energy-efficiency measures will reduce consumption, but achieving such reductions is by no means guaranteed. For California to meet its 2030 emissions target, for instance, one scenario calls for three million to eight million electric vehicles, which would significantly increase electricity demand. Even if by some miracle California did manage to replace 100 percent of Diablo Canyon’s output with renewables, why would a state ostensibly concerned with climate change turn away from its largest single source of clean energy? The answer, as is perhaps obvious, is the ideological insistence on renewables and an irrational fear of nuclear power. The only countries that have successfully moved from fossil fuels to low-carbon power have done so with the help of nuclear energy. And the backlash against antinuclear policies is growing. Increasingly, scientists and conservationists in the United States are speaking out in defense of nuclear power. If California indeed closes Diablo Canyon, emissions will either rise or fail to fall as quickly as they could, and the antinuclear agenda will be exposed as anathema to climate protection.",2016-06-30T11:21:23.000+02:00,NYTIMES,oped-opinion

''Nuclear power is one of the greatest threats to our environment,'' Mr. Carlsson told a labor rally in Stockholm, adding that the Chernobyl accident had strengthened Sweden's conviction that nuclear power must be eliminated. ''The Chernobyl accident has spread radioactive iodine and cesium over our fields, forests, moors and lakes,'' Mr. Carlsson said. ''We have been forced to take drastic measures that seem strange and frightening. ''Cows have had to be kept indoors. Reindeer meat from various districts is not fit for human consumption. We are having to measure the radioactivity of our berries, mushrooms and fish - all this in order to prevent human beings from eating dangerous substances. Nuclear power must be got rid of.'' Vote to Close Reactors In 1980 Swedes voted to close down the country's 12 nuclear reactors by the year 2010. Immediately after the Chernobyl accident April 26, the Government appointed a commission to inquire into whether the process should be speeded. The commission's report is expected in the autumn. Sweden was the first country to alert the world to the accident at the Soviet reactor in the Ukraine, after Swedish technicians had detected a wave of radiation sweeping over the Baltic. Influential groups within Mr. Carlsson's ruling Social Democratic Party want an immediate abolition of nuclear power, which provides more than 40 percent of Sweden's energy. Sweden says its nuclear program is the safest in the world. Mr. Carlsson's position up to now has been that the reactors will be closed down ahead of schedule only if experts appointed by the Government say nuclear power is dangerous. Mr. Carlsson has in the past stressed that Sweden's economic future is at stake in the debate. ''My country is not a toy shop,'' he told angry Danish questioners in June. ''It needs energy.'' Worrying Reports on Food His speech today, however, showed a much tougher antinuclear position. The apparent change came after a series of increasingly troubling reports about the effects of the Chernobyl fallout on Swedish food. Up to 100,000 reindeer carcasses are likely to be buried over the next five years because of high radioactivity levels. This is a major threat to the future of many of Sweden's 15,000 Lapps, whose livelihood depends on reindeer-herding, despite the fact that the Government has promised to pay compensation. For the same reason, a question mark is also hanging over the autumn elk-hunting season, during which 130,000 animals are usually shot. Both are an important source of meat. Picking mushrooms and berries in the forests is a popular Swedish pastime, but warnings by the National Food Administration have cast a shadow over this year's season. Fish and Lambs The same agency has also warned Swedes not to eat freshwater fish too often in the areas worst affected by the fallout. Concerns were also expressed last week that up to 30,000 lambs might not be fit for human consumption when they are slaughtered next month. Immediately after the Chernobyl accident, the Radiological Protection Board said traces of the fallout would be found in Swedish food well into the next century, but not in dangerous quantities. Samples taken since then, however, have shown higher-than-expected traces, particularly of radioactive cesium 137. The Government, which estimates that the Chernobyl disaster has cost Sweden $160 million so far, has said it is not asking for compensation from the Soviet Union because international conventions do not cover such claims.",1986-08-18T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world

This is a mixed blessing. The subject had been off limits to environmentally correct politicians since the spring of 1979, when the Three Mile Island accident inspired the Woodstock of the antinuke movement. More than 65,000 protesters marched on the Capitol to hear energy experts like Jackson Browne and Benjamin Spock -- and, of course, Jane Fonda, an authority because of her role in the ''The China Syndrome.'' Celebrities and politicians, warning of meltdowns and cancer epidemics, demanded the shutdown of all nuclear plants. Protesters dressed as mushrooms chanted, ''Two, four, six, eight, we don't want to radiate.'' I went to the rally sympathetic to the movement but left unsure of which was scarier, nuclear power or its enemies. Now some prominent environmentalists are having second thoughts, as Felicity Barringer reported in Sunday's Times. Given the threat of global warming, they say, encouraging new nuclear power plants may be necessary. And Congress is about to take up proposals to reinvigorate the industry. On the one hand, this risk-benefit analysis is a refreshing improvement over the doomsday speeches and the chanting mushrooms. But by looking to Congress to chart a grand new energy policy, environmentalists are making the same mistake they made when they helped create the nuclear industry. Environmentalists originally supported nuclear power because of its obvious benefits: no dirty air from smokestacks, no need to strip the ground for coal or dig for oil. Economic benefits, however, were not so obvious to investors, who were leery of the plants' costs and new problems, like accidents and waste disposal. But Washington decided that nuclear power was so good for the environment and national security -- how would America cope with the crisis when fossil fuels ran out? -- that it should be subsidized. The federal government exempted the industry from full liability for accidents and took responsibility for waste disposal. If Washington hadn't acted, nuclear power plants wouldn't have been built so fast, maybe not at all. But if the industry had been forced to deal with the costs and the risks on its own, it might have developed cheaper, simpler, more reliable plants. Instead, it built unwieldy plants that were prone to problems, making them costly to operate and also inciting public fears. Even though the fears about the American industry were overblown, they led to tighter regulations and more expense. Some proponents of nuclear power argue that the U.S. industry was killed by too much regulation; others say it simply lost out to the fossil fuels we were supposed to be running out of. Whatever the reason, investors looking for a profit lost interest long ago in building nuclear plants in America. But now, just as in the 1950's, some environmentalists and politicians are seeing something that investors don't. They think that uranium could once again be the fuel of the future -- with their guidance. Senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman are working on a plan in which conservatives would support limits on fossil fuel emissions if liberals agreed to subsidies for corporations working on new nuclear technologies. The rationale is the new environmental crisis, global warming, which may turn out to be more real than the 1950's crisis of vanishing fossil fuels. But even if environmentalists and politicians are right this time about the problem, there's little reason to trust them to figure out which form of energy will be the solution. Starting with nuclear power, they've backed one loser after another for the past half-century. They promised that their subsidies would move us beyond fossil fuels and produce electricity from vast solar arrays, solar towers, geothermal heat, ocean waves, sugar beets, corn, manure and something called biogas (you don't want to know). But when the subsidies ran out, the electricity stopped. If politicians are determined to combat global warming, their best bet is to try something they understand: imposing taxes. A tax on carbon emissions would make investors take into account the risks of global warming. I don't know if it would make them want to build new nuclear power plants, but I trust them to figure it out better than anyone in Washington who claims to see the energy future. And at least they don't dress up as mushrooms. Op-Ed Columnist E-mail: tierney@nytimes.com",2005-05-17T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,opinion

Clears the Way for Shoreham to Be Dismantled,"In what may be the death blow to the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission agreed yesterday to grant a license that clears the way for the eventual dismantling of the plant's nuclear systems. Once these systems are taken down at the plant that was once the centerpiece of energy plans for Long Island, it will be virtually impossible to restore them and make Shoreham a nuclear plant. Joseph W. McDonnell, a spokesman for the Long Island Lighting Company, which owns the plant. called the decision ""symbolically important,"" saying that it was the first formal recognition by the Federal nuclear agency that Shoreham would not be used as a nuclear plant. State officials said they hoped to begin taking Shoreham apart as early as this fall. 'Possession Only' License The N.R.C.'s action today would change Lilco's current operating license, making it what is known as a ""possession only"" license. The licensing change, which means the company can own -- but not run -- a nuclear plant, makes it possible for the N.R.C. to approve the next steps: transfer to the state and removal of the nuclear equipment. The state is studying the possibility of converting Shoreham to a gas-fired plant. If it is dismantled, at a projected cost of $186 million to Lilco ratepayers, it will be the first major nuclear plant ever to be completed and then closed before opening. The $5.5 billion, 809-megawatt plant, on a rural road in Suffolk County, was completed in 1984 and successfully generated power in low-level testing. But political pressures overtook it and it was never allowed to operate. In 1989, under intense pressure from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who argued that it would be impossible to safely evacuate the far reaches of Long Island where Shoreham lies, the lighting company agreed to sell the plant to the state for $1 in exchange for guarantees of 10 years of rate increases. Under the plan, the state was then to take the plant apart. But for the last two years, the transfer agreement has been bogged down in Washington, as supporters of nuclear energy, including the Federal Department of Energy, have been arguing before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that Shoreham should be allowed to remain open. The ruling was a blow to the Bush Administration, which at one time seemed intent on keeping Shoreham alive. In April 1989, as the settlement to close Shoreham seemed imminent, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, citing Long Island's need for power, said his agency would do ""everything possible"" to keep the plant from being dismantled. And it is a victory to Governor Cuomo, who fought for years to prevent Shoreham from ever opening. Yesterday, Mr. Cuomo called the nuclear agency's decision, issued from its headquarters in Rockville, Md., ""a significant step in implementing my settlement to close and decommission Shoreham."" Immediately after hearing of the ruling, Shoreham's supporters vowed to fight it in court. James P. McGranery Jr., the lawyer who represents two groups who support the plant's eventual operation, Scientists and Engineers for Secure Energy and the Shoreham-Wading River Central School District, said the next step would be to seek review in the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, which has jurisdiction over the nuclear commission's decision. Failing that, he said, he would go to the United States Supreme Court. ""The issuance of a possession-only license is irreversible and irretrievable,"" Mr. McGranery said. ""It would mean that the licensee would be free to begin significant dismantling of the plant. And there is no precedent for the reconversion of a possession-only license to a full-power operating license."" 10 Days to Appeal Richard M. Kessel, chairman of the state Long Island Power Authority, which would take Shoreham over from Lilco under the plan, said that even now, resurrecting the plant would take two or three years and cost between $500 million and $750 million. In yesterday's ruling, the commission gave the two groups 10 days to appeal the decision in court. Even though this decision is a crucial step in the decommissioning process, before any dismantling can begin the N.R.C. still has to specifically approve the transfer to the state and the state's dismantling plan. Shoreham's saga began more than 25 years ago, when the Long Island Lighting Company decided to build a nuclear power plant that would eventually power a third of the Island's 900,000 households. In 1967, the plant's cost was estimated at $271 million. To date, it has cost more than $5.5 billion. Shoreham was finished in 1984, but controversy had emerged over how Long Island it would be evacuated if there was an emergency there. During the next three years, while the lighting company successfully conducted low-power tests, and several Federal agencies conducted evacuation exercises, Governor Cuomo worked to make sure that it would never open. In 1989, a settlement to close Shoreham was approved. Got Full-Power License Under it, Lilco would sell the plant to the state, and the state, through the newly-formed Long Island Power Authority, would take it apart. Soon afterward, the nuclear commission granted Lilco a full-power license. But by that time, the issue was moot, because both the Governor and, reluctantly, the lighting company, had pledged that it would never operate. Today, Shoreham sits quietly, its fuel removed from its nuclear core but most other systems in place. Engineers with specialized licenses to operate it still spend their days in the control room, as required under the current license. As Shoreham's supporters on Long Island excoriated what they said was a wasteful and nonsensical agreement, the Bush Administration tried for a time to make Shoreham a showcase for the importance of nuclear energy. The Department of Energy this winter filed an amicus brief supporting Shoreham's proponents, but it failed to formally intervene before the N.R.C.",1991-06-13T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Eager to beat back a growing anti-nuclear movement, the Japanese Government constantly reminds people that this country's reactors suffer far fewer glitches and emergency shutdowns than plants in the United States or Europe. Workers are trained more intensively. Facilities are inspected more rigorously. Much like making computer chips and defect-free cars, the argument goes, nuclear safety is a matter of discipline and controlling the process. Those reassurances lost a bit of their persuasive power in 60 panicked minutes last weekend in Mihama, a small town on the Japan Sea. Just after lunch, meters in the control room of a 19-year-old plant showed a sudden jump in radioactivity, often a warning sign of a leak in one of the small tubes carrying superheated radioactive water into the plant's steam generator. While workers spent 50 minutes trying to determine if the meter was providing false readings -- a common occurrence -- the plant was heading toward potential disaster. When the workers finally realized that a burst tube was pouring tons of mildly radioactive water into the steam generator, where the water supply is supposed to be pure, they activated a critical emergency pressure valve. It failed. Moments later alarms rang and an emergency system flooded the reactor to prevent a meltdown. No one was hurt in what Japanese officials said was the country's worst nuclear ""incident"" -- they refused to call it an accident -- but a small amount of radiation was released into the atmosphere. Just how narrowly Japan skirted nuclear disaster is still an unanswered question. But if there is never a good time for a nuclear accident, this was a particularly bad one. Seizing on the clear message of the gulf crisis, the Government's legions of industrial planners have been pushing hard in recent months to convince the country that it must double the number of nuclear reactors in the next two decades. Japan's 40 nuclear power plants already generate more than a quarter of the country's electricity, making the Japanese more dependent on nuclear technology than anyone except the French. But as one senior government official put it not long ago, ""When you've got no oil, you've got no choice."" What is slowing these plans is a phenomenon the Japanese usually only read about: a growing, grass-roots movement to reverse national policy. A population that silently endures outrageous prices and shrugs its shoulders at revelations of political corruption seems increasingly nervous about nuclear power. Losing Faith A 1984 government poll showed that 70 percent of the public thought that nuclear power was reliable. In 1987 the figure fell to 52 percent. After two major nuclear ""incidents"" in the last two years -- a plant in Fukushima was shut down in 1989 when chunks of metal broke free and clogged a critical pump -- no one in power is likely to ask the question again anytime soon. For four decades Japan has taught its schoolchildren about the horrors of radiation sickness from the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But now those teachings are redounding on the nuclear power industry, especially as it becomes clear that in a country this small it is impossible to put plants far from major population centers. ""People are beginning to realize that nuclear technology is not as mature as they were led to believe,"" said Atsushi Tsuchida, a researcher at Japan's Institute of Physical and Chemical Research and a leading critic of the industry. It does not help, he said, that the Government institution responsible for acting as a watchdog over nuclear safety is also the one in charge of convincing the public that it needs a rapidfire build-up of new nuclear projects. That institution is Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry. A major part of the ministry's job is securing energy supplies, from coordinating the purchase of oil around the world to spending millions on experimental projects like the fast breeder reactor, which generates nuclear fuel faster than it consumes it. Other projects are under way to design reactors that extend the life of nuclear fuel and to build Japan's first spent-fuel reprocessing center, at a site in northern Honshu that has become a lightning rod for the antinuclear movement. In a local election two weeks ago, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party beat back challengers to the plant, but only after enormous expenditures by both party leaders and utility companies. To Japan's credit, its record so far is impressive. In 1988 the average number of unplanned shutdowns per reactor -- that is, problems so severe that the plug must be pulled -- was only 0.4, compared with 4.0 in the United States and 5.3 in France. But Japanese often become prisoners of their own statistics. There is strong if unspoken pressure not to shut a plant down and ruin the numbers. That pressure seemed to be at play in the Fukushima accident, when a pump was allowed to rattle and shake for 14 hours before it was shut down. Just as in the Fukushima case, the Japanese public only learned the more chilling details of last week's Mihama accident days later, after government and utility officials were finished with their no-problem, everything-under-control patter. ""On the whole, we are very happy with the way the system worked,"" Ryuko Fujii, an official of MITI's Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, told reporters. But for Japan, he conceded, ""this is not a scientific issue. It depends on how the public changes its mind.""",1991-02-17T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,week-in-review

You argue that to require the participation of state and local governments in emergency planning around nuclear plants is to violate this exclusive authority. You also suggest that if Congress disagrees, it should pass a law making clear its will in the matter. The fact is that Congress has passed such a law, and it was the root of the current Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirement that state and local governments participate in emergency planning. In authorizing the N.R.C. for the fiscal year 1979-80, Congress adopted an amendment that not only allowed state and local participation, but also made any new license contingent on such participation. As adopted by the Senate in July 1979, this amendment (offered by myself and Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming) applied to existing nuclear plants as well as new license applications. Investigations into the Three Mile Island accident of that March had then just begun. But Senator Simpson and I, as ranking minority member and chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Subcommittee, had been stunned to learn there were no plans for protecting or evacuating the people who lived near that plant. In adopting our requirement, the Senate first debated the issues that you raise - the primacy of the Federal responsibility, the rights of states and localities, and the practical consequences of giving states and localities de facto veto power over nuclear plant licenses. The Senate then adopted the amendment (Congressional Record, July 16, 1979, S. 9466-9484, pages 18,658-676). After an extended conference, the House and Senate adopted the modified amendment as part of the conference report in June 1980. Two months later, the N.R.C. adopted the regulation you refer to, specifying a 10-mile emergency planning zone. In a nuclear accident, evacuation will rely on the emergency personnel, equipment and facilities of the state and local governments. Utility personnel are not an acceptable substitute, either legally or practically. This view was upheld by a New York State Appeals Court the very day your editorial appeared. We should and must include these governments in preparation for such an event. Otherwise, the Federal Government presumes to give orders on its own to mobilize state and local emergency resources effectively. Such a presumption would extend the power of the Federal Government well beyond current limits and well beyond the issue of nuclear-power licenses. But far more than the relative authority of governments is at stake. The central concern must be public health and safety. As a practical matter, we cannot contemplate emergency evacuation unless we are sure state and local resources will be available and prepared. The only way to be so assured is to include the state and local authorities from the outset. And the only way we can know they are ready is to make their participation a precondition for licensing a plant. It would be enormously difficult to evacuate Long Island or the vicinity of the Seabrook plant in New Hampshire even under the best circumstances. And we can scarcely find ''reasonable assurance'' (to use the phrase we used in 1979 and 1980) in the utilities' contention that local and state authorities will fall in line sooner or later. The N.R.C. was once content to believe nuclear plants so safe that nearby populations needed no special protection. Three Mile Island and Chernobyl have exploded this myth. Governor Cuomo is right to resist Shoreham's licensing, and Governor Dukakis is right to resist Seabrook's. Their responsibility to protect the citizens of their states demands that they do no less.

The decision came from an atomic safety and licensing board established by the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission to review the plant's emergency power system. Barring some unforeseen development, of which there have been many in the tortuous history of Shoreham, the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will issue a license early next week for the low-power testing, said a spokesman for the agency, Clare Miles. The licensing board authorized the low-power license after finding ''reasonable assurance'' that Shoreham's three emergency diesel generators, which earlier had developed mechanical problems, could be operated safely during the first year or so. That finding essentially made moot a ruling last Tuesday by the commission itself denying a low-power license to Shoreham. In denying the license, the commission said Lilco had not provided adequate security against vandalism or terrorism for diesel generators that had been brought in to replace the three that had developed mechanical problems. The diesel generators are within the security area of the plant. Critics of the plant can still appeal the licensing board's decision to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and in court and can request a stay of the license pending the appeal. Governor Cuomo's special counsel, Fabian Palomino, and Wayne Prospect, a leader of the Shoreham opposition in the Suffolk County Legislature, both said they would appeal the decision. Lilco officials expressed pleasure at the board's ruling. ''The Shoreham plant is ready to operate,'' said a Lilco spokesman, Carol Clawson. The plant has so far been tested at 0.001 of its full power of 809 megawatts. At that low level, the nuclear chain reaction is so restrained that it generates very little heat. Mrs. Clawson said the company would proceed to increase the power to 5 percent as soon as possible after the license is issued. Lilco has been pressing to begin testing Shoreham, which is on the North Shore of Long Island in the town of Brookhaven, about 55 miles east of Manhattan. Such a test would include the first substantial production of heat by a nuclear chain reaction and would mean that the plant's inner workings would become contaminated with radioactivity, making it more expensive to decommission if the plant eventually does not go into operation. Mr. Palomino said it would be ''fiscal folly'' for Lilco to begin low-power testing of the plant, becuase it lacks an emergency evacuation plan, which is required for issuance of a license to operate the plant at full power. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has already ruled that such an emergency plan is not necessary for low-power testing. The utility is still seeking approval from the Federal agency of an emergency plan so it can proceed with full-power testing. The Suffolk County Executive, Peter F. Cohalan, who two weeks ago dropped his opposition to a test of an evacuation plan, said in a statement yesterday: ''Today's decision by the licensing board increases the probability that the Shoreham nuclear power station will become radioactive. ''In that event, the county has a duty and responsibility to provide for the health and safety of the residents near the plant. That is the reason why I've called for a test of an emergency response plan.'' Mr. Palomino, in a statement issued at about the same time as Mr. Cohalan's, said: ''Since there is a lack of legal ability to implement Lilco's off-site emergency evacuation plan, Lilco will not be able to get a full power license. ''Given this circumstance, it would be fiscal folly for Lilco to contaminate the plant under the low power license.'' He said the low-power testing would result in an additional cost of $150 million to shut the plant. Emergency diesel generators are required at a nuclear power plant to supply electrical power to safely shut down the plant if power from the outside is cut off. Trouble With Generators Lilco purchased three diesel generators, the size of railroad locomotives, manafucatured by Transamerica DeLaval Inc. The Shoreham plant had been ready for low-power testing in 1983, but on Aug. 12, 1983, the crankshaft of one of the three diesels snapped during testing of the emergency generators. Inspections revealed cracks in the crankshafts of the two other diesels, as well as other defects. Lilco, barred from proceeding with low-power testing, sought in two ways to resolve the problems. First, it began repairs to make the original diesels useable. Also, it brought in four new diesel generators and a gas turbine. If yesterday's ruling is upheld, this additional equipment will not be necessary.",1985-06-15T09:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,metropolitan-desk-new-york
b8d83af4-6983-423e-a059-6f5cb014e6ab,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/business/global/26nuclear.html,"In Reassessment, Swiss Drop Plans to Build 3 Reactors","BRUSSELS — The Swiss government decided Wednesday to abandon plans to build new nuclear reactors, while European Union regulators agreed on a framework for stress-testing theirs, as repercussions from the disaster in Japan continue to ripple across Europe. The Swiss Energy Minister Doris Leuthard had suspended the approvals process for three new reactors, pending a safety review, after the accident that struck the reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan after the earthquake and tsunami of March 11. On Wednesday — days after an anti-nuclear rally in Switzerland drew a large crowd of 20,000 people — the Cabinet said it had decided to make the ban permanent. The country’s five existing reactors — which supply about 40 percent of the country’s power — would be allowed to continue operating, but would not be replaced at the end of their life span, it said. The last would go offline in 2034. In a statement, the Cabinet said it was responding to the desires of the Swiss people to reduce risks “in the face of the severe damage that the earthquake and tsunami in Fukushima caused.” However, it said that there was no need to shut down plants ahead of schedule, insisting that their safe operation was assured. The lengthy phase-out will also allow time for Switzerland to develop new energy sources and improve energy efficiency, it said, adding that long-term, nuclear energy was expected to lose its competitive advantage over renewable sources of energy because the costs associated with nuclear power, such as for new safety standards and equipment, are expected to climb. The nuclear fuel meltdowns in Japan have prompted different reactions in other parts of Europe. France, which relies on nuclear power for about 80 percent of its electricity and is a major exporter of nuclear technology, has reaffirmed its commitment to the technology. Just across the border, however, the German government reversed a previous decision to extend the life of its nuclear plants and is working on a plan to accelerate the phase out there. Meanwhile, national regulators from across the 27-nation European Union are planning new safety tests for the 143 operating nuclear reactors in their territories. On Wednesday, they agreed that the tests would include some man-made disasters as well as natural ones. But the European Commission said that there would be a separate process to check whether nuclear operators could adequately thwart acts of terrorism, because of sharp differences among governments about encroaching on sensitive areas of defense and security. The E.U. energy commissioner, Günther Oettinger, said at a news conference in Brussels that the tests would be robust. “The quality and the depth of this stress test is such as to fulfill the requirements of the European citizen to live in a safe environment,” Mr. Oettinger said. “All of this will be done in as transparent way as possible.” Greenpeace, an environmental group that opposes nuclear power, strongly disagreed. The tests “won’t be independent, won’t cover plans for emergencies and won’t always tell us whether some of Europe’s most obvious terrorist targets are protected or not,” said Jan Haverkamp, a nuclear policy adviser at Greenpeace. Britain, France and the Czech Republic were among countries that had fought hardest to water down the tests, Mr. Haverkamp said. Britain generates only around 18 percent of its electricity from nuclear power but faces the prospect of a worsening energy shortfall if it is required to shut its reactors. The Czech Republic still mines uranium for sale to nuclear power generators. Still, atomic power remains a hugely sensitive matter after the Ukrainian nuclear disaster in Chernobyl in 1986 spread fallout across the Continent. Although the tests remain voluntary, the European Commission recommended that the 14 member states with reactors producing electricity begin testing for so-called man-made events by June 1. Those tests would in some cases be more rigorous than routine safety checks. For example, power plants built to withstand earthquakes of a magnitude of 6.0 would be tested for earthquakes of a higher magnitude, although it would be up to the authorities in each country to define how much tougher to make the criteria. The tests also would include peer-review teams composed of seven people, drawing from regulators from all 27 E.U. countries and the European Commission. Those teams would have leeway to conduct inspections inside nuclear plants. According to the commission, the key goal of the tests is to prevent the kind of accident in Europe that struck the reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The commission said nuclear operators would need to describe what would happen if their reactors lost power for “several days” and what measures were in place if primary backup systems powered by batteries also failed. The tests would include a review of containment systems to ensure they could withstand an air crash or the explosion of a nearby oil tanker, whether as a result of an accident or a terror attack. The tests would also seek to ascertain whether there were adequate systems to put out any resulting fire from explosions occurring near nuclear power plants. The E.U. authorities still need to set a schedule for checking whether reactors could withstand a wider range of terror attacks, possibly including cyber attacks. Those tests are far more sensitive because governments want to avoid revealing any vulnerabilities of their reactors. The commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said that reactors failing the tests should be shut down and decommissioned if safety upgrades were too difficult or too expensive. But it acknowledged that it had no authority to order such shutdowns. The European Commission said national operators and regulators had agreed to make their findings public, despite initial concerns in Paris and London that publishing certain information might encourage attacks. Governments would present a final report on the tests at the end of year. Paul Geitner contributed reporting from Paris.",2011-05-25T16:22:49.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-global-business

Nuclear power provides about 70 percent of France’s electricity, a bigger share than any other country in the world. But around half of France’s atomic fleet, the largest in Europe, has been taken offline as a storm of unexpected problems swirls around the nation’s state-backed nuclear power operator, Électricité de France, or EDF. The outages at EDF, Europe’s biggest electricity exporter, have sent France’s nuclear power output tumbling to its lowest level in nearly 30 years, pushing French electric bills to record highs just as the war in Ukraine is stoking broader inflation. Instead of pumping vast amounts of electricity to Britain, Italy and other European countries pivoting from Russian oil, France faces the unsettling prospect of initiating rolling blackouts this winter and having to import power.",2022-06-19T07:03:18.000+02:00,NYTIMES,globalbusiness

But New Jersey's nuclear operators plan to embellish those symbolic structures in the next few years: squat concrete blockhouses filled with radioactive nuclear waste. As policymakers in Washington squabble over the eventual resting place for the toxic byproduct of decades of nuclear power, radioactive waste has been piling up at nuclear plants around the country. And as the plants run out of room in the pools of deep water now used for temporary storage, operators have had to look elsewhere to store the material. The solution -- highly reinforced steel and concrete containers at the nuclear plants. New Jersey's oldest commercial reactor, the Oyster Creek generating station in Toms River, is quickly running out of room. As a result, said a spokesman for AmerGen, the consortium that owns the plant, the company plans to begin loading radioactive waste into storage containers at the plant next spring. PSE&G Nuclear, which operates three plants in Salem County, says it plans to store nuclear waste the same way, beginning by 2007. ''It is going to be necessary for continued safe operation,'' said Skip Sindoni, a spokesman for PSE&G Nuclear. Anti-nuclear activists have condemned the plans, saying they will lead to the buildup of nuclear waste at scattered sites around the country. But barring a shutdown of nuclear power plants, companies say they have little choice. New Jersey's four nuclear plants produce more than 3,800 megawatts of power -- nearly one-quarter of the state's peak power need. For nearly 20 years, the federal government has promised to construct a long-term storage dump to contain radioactive waste from the country's nuclear plants. Federal regulators have recommended a site at Yucca Mountain, Nev., as a repository, but the selection has been met with protests from environmentalists and Congressional opponents alike. In the meantime, power plant operators have been storing nuclear waste in pools with limited capacity originally designed to cool radioactive material before it was shipped to a disposal site. At Oyster Creek, plant operators say they are close to running out of room. ''We do not have enough space to take all the fuel in the reactor and put it in the pool,' said Ralph DeSantis, a spokesman for one of AmerGen's parent companies, Exelon Corporation. Although it is not a requirement, plant operators prefer having room in the cooling pool in case an emergency forces them to remove active fuel rods from the reactor core. As for Oyster Creek, Mr. DeSantis said the pools had already passed that point. Instituting the plans is not something that can be done overnight. The storage bunkers and specialized containers for the waste take several years to build. The former owner of the Oyster Creek plant started the process in 1993, Mr. DeSantis said. The construction ran into some problems when a barge carrying some concrete slabs ran aground in Barnegatt Bay, but the bunkers were finished by 1995. The nuclear waste, metallic remnants of the uranium fuel, will be loaded into stainless steel canisters insider the cooling pool. Each canister, 14 feet long and 3 feet wide, weighs 25,000 pounds and can contain 49,000 pounds of the dense nuclear waste. Once filled and welded shut, the canisters will be sealed in a reinforced concrete bunker. Both security at the site and the durability of the waste storage are subject to approval by federal regulations. E. William Brach, director of the spent fuel project office for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said 20 nuclear operators used the storage system. Of them, Mr. Brach said there had been no reported cases of radioactive material leaking from the canisters, although there was a case in which a buildup of hydrogen gas blew the lid off one. Mr. Brach said the problem that caused the gas buildup had been fixed. In addition, Mr. Brach said federal regulators had also reviewed concerns that the storage sites could become potential targets for terrorist attacks. ''We feel the robustness and the design of the cask provide for adequate protection,'' he said. Nuclear watchdog groups have mixed opinions on the storage plan. ''It is a conundrum,'' said Paul Gunter of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service. ''What do you do with the waste?'' Mr. Gunter said the nuclear operators had little option but to store the waste at the plants, though his group has criticized some of the storage plans in the past, saying concerns over costs play too large a role in determining the storage plan. David Lochbaum, an engineer with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the storage programs have generally operated smoothly despite scattered problems, asserting that once the waste was properly stored in the cement casks, the method was safer than using the cooling pools. ''There are more things that can go wrong in the spent fuel pool,'' he said. ''The casks are designed to be dropped, hit by a locomotive, things like that.'' ENVIRONMENT Correction: June 17, 2001, Sunday Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about storing nuclear waste at plants in New Jersey misstated the location of the Oyster Creek nuclear generating station. It is in the Forked River section of Lacey Township, not Toms River. The article also misspelled the name of the bay where a barge carrying equipment for the plant ran aground. It is Barnegat, not Barnegatt.",2001-06-10T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Video Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said two United Nations experts would remain at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to provide independent assessments of its safety. Credit Credit... Leonhard Foeger/Reuters ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine — The gravest risk to the embattled Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is physical damage to equipment from shelling that could lead to a release of radiation, the director of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog agency said Friday after a visit to the site. Other risks abound, Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters in Vienna, a day after inspecting the nuclear station in southern Ukraine. The plant has been repeatedly hit by artillery. Loss of external power to cool reactor cores and stress on the operating staff also pose dangers, he said. “It is obvious there is a lot of fighting in general in this part of Ukraine,” Mr. Grossi said. “The military activity and operations are increasing in that part of the country, and this worries me a lot.” Mr. Grossi said two United Nations experts would remain at the plant to provide independent assessments of its safety going forward. Most of the damage from the war at the sprawling station, which is the largest nuclear plant in Europe, occurred during shelling in August, Mr. Grossi said, unless one considers the destruction from the battle in March when the Russian army captured the site. The Zaporizhzhia plant, nestled in a gentle valley of farm fields in a once sleepy and provincial corner of Ukraine that is now a site of raging battles along a front line, became this year the first active nuclear plant to be caught in a combat zone in the history of civilian nuclear power. Over all, not one of what the nuclear monitoring agency calls the seven pillars of nuclear safety, which include physical integrity, reliable external power and availability of spare parts, remains intact, Mr. Grossi said. The plant has six reactors and before the war provided 30 percent of Ukraine’s electricity. But on some points the agency’s initial assessment was more optimistic than the picture painted by Ukrainian officials, who had said that engineers and other employees had been subjected to harsh interrogation and even torture, raising stress levels when they returned to work in reactor control rooms and in other critical jobs. Mr. Grossi said he had spoken with the Ukrainian employees and that they had found a way to cooperate — what he called “cohabitation” — with the Russian soldiers and nuclear experts also at the site. “The plant continues to operate, and there is a professional modus vivendi, if I can put it that way,” he said. Before the visit, Ukrainian officials had said the agency should discount anything employees at the plant said, arguing they are essentially hostages. Mr. Grossi said the Ukrainian and Russian nuclear engineers had managed to “cope” in operating the site and that he was less worried about disruptions in regulatory oversight and supplies of spare parts, those these problems also loomed as risks. He spoke after he and a team of inspectors crossed a front line in Russia’s war in Ukraine to conduct an inspection. Their mission was delayed by artillery strikes on their planned route, part of a swirl of chaotic violence in and around the station. Mr. Grossi said his assessment was bound to disappoint both sides for declining to place blame on one or another army for the shells hitting the plant. “I don’t want to pretend what we are doing will end this terrible war or give back this plant to Ukraine,” he said. The mission was limited to gauging nuclear safety, something he said the two-man team remaining at the site would do. “Now, when there is an allegation that something has happened at the plant, you can turn to us,” he said, rather than weighing the conflicting claims of Russia and Ukraine. “That’s the difference.” He said Russian soldiers had not blocked access to areas of the site he asked to visit. Asked to compare the potential fallout from a radiation release at Zaporizhzhia with the fire and meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in 1986, which spread radiation around Europe in the world’s worst civilian nuclear accident, Mr. Grossi said designs of the two power stations are not comparable. Zaporizhzhia’s reactors have containment vessels to limit radiation release. But he said disruptions in external power to cool reactor cores could lead to a meltdown. “It could be a big thing or a small thing, depending on the damage” from the fighting, he said.",2022-09-03T01:54:14.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Public Power Supply has one nuclear plant producing electricity. The only other nuclear plant in the Northwest that ever generated power, the Trojan plant in Rainier, Ore., owned by Portland General Electric, was closed in January 1993. Public Power Supply's unfinished plants, which had huge cost overruns, were opposed by environmental groups and had financial troubles. In 1983 Public Power Supply defaulted on $2.25 billion worth of municipal bonds used to finance the plants. After the default, the nation's largest municipal bond default at the time, construction stopped and the utility became embroiled in litigation. Today's vote came after more than a decade of political, financial and legal battles and after the utility spent $100 million to maintain the unfinished plants, Units 1 and 3. The vote means that legal work will now proceed to disentangle more than 100 municipal or county-owned utilities that have shares in the plants and whose customers have been paying to support them. A Drain on Finances The 13 members of the full board acted at the request of Randall Hardy, chief executive officer of the Bonneville Power Administration, a Federal agency that buys power and resells it to local utilities. The municipal and county-owned utilities had agreed to buy the output of the nuclear plants and have been paying the $10 million needed each year to keep the plants ready for construction to resume. Mr. Hardy said this had been a drain on finances. The board left the door open to consider two proposals now before it to modify the plants to use plutonium to produce power in ventures with the Federal Department of Energy. It said they should be left intact until Jan. 13, 1995, to give the Clinton Administration time to develop a policy on disposing of the nation's stockpile of plutonium from military weapons. Vera Claussen, the secretary of the board and a commissioner of the Grant County Public Utility District, said today's action ""was not an easy decision."" ""It is in the best interest of the region to move forward and to look to the future, putting efforts and time into projects that are really a possibility,"" she said. Steven Klien, superintendent of Tacoma City Light, said the vote was not for or against nuclear power. ""It is just that there are other, more cost-effective, power resources available,"" he said.

Irradiated fuel accumulates at reactors with no rational storage solution, increasing the potential for theft by those seeking to produce nuclear weapons. Further, Indian Point was mentioned as a target in the documents of Al Qaeda. Most important, financing nuclear power would divert scarce resources from investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency.

He was 86. Born in the United States, Dr. Radkowsky was the chief American scientist for the design of nuclear reactors for naval ships and submarines from 1950 through 1972. He also headed the design team that built the United States' first full-scale commercial nuclear power plant in Shippingport, Pa. In the 1980's, Dr. Radkowsky developed a technology, now being tested, that replaces much of the uranium at the core of a nuclear reactor with thorium, a cheap and relatively plentiful element occurring in minerals. When thorium is used, the nuclear reactions are altered so that the reactor produces much less plutonium, and the radioactive waste it does create is more difficult to refine for use in bombs. ''Alvin specifically had the goal of stopping reactors from producing weapons-grade material,'' said Seth Grae, president of Thorium Power Inc., a company Dr. Radkowsky helped found in 1992 to bring his design to market. Dr. Radkowsky hoped the thorium fuel design could be offered to countries like North Korea and Cuba, allowing them to use reactors to generate electricity but largely eliminating worries that they would scavenge the spent fuel rods for nuclear weapons. ''He was an outstanding nuclear engineer working successfully on an important and timely topic,'' said Dr. Edward Teller, who was Dr. Radkowsky's master's thesis adviser at George Washington University before World War II. ''I believe his argument for thorium, that it cannot be easily used for military purposes, is valid.'' In a letter to The New York Times in 1984, Dr. Radowsky said that ''a thorium reactor's plutonium production rate would be less than 2 percent of that of a standard reactor, and the plutonium's isotopic content would make it unsuitable for a nuclear detonation.'' A variation of the thorium idea may allow the Department of Energy to use excess plutonium in commercial nuclear power plants, also without creating byproducts suitable for weapons. Thorium Power is running tests at the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow. Mr. Grae said he hoped the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would approve the thorium fuel assembly for use in American nuclear reactors in three to four years. Alvin Radkowsky was born in Elizabeth, N.J., and graduated from City College of New York in 1935 with a degree in electrical engineering. He received his master's degree in physics from George Washington University in 1942, studying under Dr. Teller, the inventor of the hydrogen bomb. He completed his doctorate in 1947 at the Catholic University of America in Washington. In 1972, Dr. Radkowsky moved to Israel and became a professor of nuclear engineering at Tel Aviv University. ''It was Alvin's efforts at Teller's request which led to him to develop this type of nuclear fuel and eventually led to the formation of the company,'' Mr. Grae said. Dr. Radkowsky was a fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Nuclear Society. He was also elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1991. Survivors include his wife, Annette Eisenberg Radkowsky; a daughter, Gilah Chukat of Israel; a brother, Lawrence Radkowsky of Silver Spring, Md.; and six grandchildren.",2002-03-05T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,obituaries

Credit... David Guttenfelder for The New York Times ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine — Shelling near a nuclear power complex in southern Ukraine killed a foreman from the facility at his home in a neighboring town, Ukrainian officials said on Sunday. The Ukrainian company that oversees the nation’s nuclear power plants, Energoatom, said that Russia had directed at least six shells at the town of Enerhodar, where most of the workers at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant live. The town is under Russian occupation, and the Russians have blamed the Ukrainians for the shelling of the giant nuclear complex — Europe’s largest — and nearby residential areas. However, the Ukrainians have said that it is the Russians who are firing on civilians, suggesting the intent is to discredit the Ukrainian Army. A statement Energoatom posted on Telegram identified the employee of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant who was killed as Marko Maksym Petrovych and said that two other workers were injured and were receiving medical care. The shelling in and around the plant in recent days has set off a flight of civilians from the area. The Zaporizhzhia plant is the first active nuclear power complex to be caught up in a combat zone. The United States and European Union have called for the establishment of a demilitarized zone, as the fighting in and around the plant and its active reactors and stored nuclear waste has sparked grave concern that an errant strike and resulting fire could cause a meltdown or release radiation. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in his nightly address on Saturday that Russia had resorted to “nuclear blackmail” at the complex, reiterating a Ukrainian analysis that Moscow was using it to slow a Ukrainian counteroffensive toward the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, where Russian conventional military defenses appear increasingly wobbly. Contrary to the fears of some analysts when Moscow launched its invasion in February, the more urgent nuclear threat in the Ukraine war now appears to be Russia damaging the civilian plant, rather than deploying its own nuclear weapons. Engineers say that yard-thick reinforced concrete containment structures protect the reactors from even direct hits. International concern, however, has grown that shelling could spark a fire or cause other damage that would lead to a nuclear accident. The six pressurized water reactors at the complex retain most sources of radiation, reducing risks. After pressurized water reactors failed at the Fukushima nuclear complex in Japan in 2011, Ukraine upgraded the Zaporizhzhia site to enable a shutdown even after the loss of cooling water from outside the containment structures, Dmytro Gortenko, a former plant engineer, said in an interview. Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said that on Saturday, Russian artillery fire hit a pump, damaged a fire station and sparked fires near the plant that could not be immediately extinguished because of the damage to the fire station. Image Natalia Lytvenenko, left, with her three daughters and their grandmother, in a convoy of civilian cars as they tried to flee the area surrounding the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, on Sunday. Credit... David Guttenfelder for The New York Times In fields near Enerhodar, long lines of cars carrying fleeing civilians formed on Saturday, according to social media posts and another former engineer at the plant who has remained in touch with local residents. “Locals are abandoning the town,” said the former engineer, who asked to be identified by only his first name, Oleksiy, because of security concerns. Residents had been leaving for weeks, but the pace picked up after Saturday’s barrages and fires, he said. Since Russia captured the plant in March, its army has controlled the facility, while Ukrainian engineers have continued to operate it. Ukrainian employees are not fleeing but sending their families away, said Oleksiy, who left in June. Enerhodar was built for plant employees in the Soviet period and had a prewar population of about 50,000. Ukraine has accused Russia of staging artillery attacks targeting Ukrainian towns across the Dnipro River from the plant starting in July, as Ukraine’s counteroffensive in the south ramped up. Overnight into Sunday morning, Russian howitzers fired on the Ukrainian town of Nikopol, which lies across a reservoir from the power plant, Yevheny Yetushenko, the Ukrainian military governor of the town, said in a post on Telegram. The Ukrainian military has said it has few options for firing back. In July, it used a self-destructing drone to strike a Russian rocket artillery launcher that sat about 150 yards from one of the plant’s reactors.",2022-08-14T19:29:20.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

While each company claims that its offer is superior, this much seems clear: the winning bid will amount to at least $806 million and also represent the largest sale of a public asset to a private buyer in New York State. Entergy has long had the inside track; for months it was the only company negotiating with the authority for the plants, until Dominion made a bigger, unsolicited bid in February. Still, Michael A. Petralia, a spokesman for the authority, said yesterday that the board of trustees would weigh both proposals equally and choose one at a meeting today in Manhattan. ''We expect that the trustees will take action, absolutely,'' Mr. Petralia said. Either way, the decision is likely to be subject to much scrutiny and second-guessing. Last week, the authority released a brief analysis by J. P. Morgan stating that both proposals were excellent and that they ''by far exceed any previous nuclear asset sale in the United States in terms of dollars per kilowatt of capacity.'' But for months now, numerous state legislators and watchdogs of nuclear power have criticized the authority for failing to make the privatization process as competitive as possible. They say that after the recent radiation leak at Indian Point 2 -- Indian Point 3's privately owned next-door neighbor -- and given the swift deregulation of utilities, such a major decision affecting taxpayers and the environment should be made as prudently and openly as possible. ''This is so important because it is by far, by orders of great magnitude, the largest sale of a publicly held asset in New York State,'' Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, said yesterday. Mr. Brodsky, who is chairman of the Assembly Committee on Environmental Conservation, said, ''There is no reason on God's earth that this deal should close tomorrow.'' The New York Power Authority was never really supposed to be in the business of nuclear power; its original mandate was to foster economic development and improve energy efficiency. In the 1970's, though, it became involved in nuclear power after a struggling Consolidated Edison built Indian Point 3, in Buchanan, but sold it to the authority before it opened. As a result, the authority and Con Edison, which runs Indian Point 2, have described themselves as ''mom and pop operators.'' But in recent years, with utility deregulation taking hold, both Con Ed and the authority have sought to sell their plants to companies that are interested in accumulating nuclear plant sites -- like Entergy, which has five, and Dominion, which has two. About two years ago, Entergy approached the Power Authority, a quasi-independent agency, about buying Indian Point 3 and the FitzPatrick reactor, said Jerry W. Yelverton, the chief executive of Entergy Nuclear. The two later began negotiations. On Feb. 14, the power authority announced that it had tentatively agreed to a deal: $638 million for the plants, and $168 for nuclear fuel stockpiles, spread over seven years. In addition, the power authority agreed to pay for most of the costs of decommissioning the plants when Entergy officials conclude that they have reached the end of their useful, or profitable, life. Yet controversy shadowed the deal. Mr. Brodsky, with fellow Democratic Assemblymen Paul D. Tonko of Montgomery County and Albert Vann of Brooklyn, criticized the Power Authority for not opening the process to competitive bidding. They said that the state, and by extension, all electricity customers, might not be getting the best price. In addition, the legislators, coupled with some nuclear power watchdog groups, complained about the power authority's failure to make public a detailed financial analysis of the bid. Then came Dominion. On Feb. 24, the company, which is the parent company of Virginia Power, made an offer for the two plants with an unsolicited bid of $686 million, and $171 million for nuclear fuel stockpiles, for a total of $857 million, or $51 million more than Entergy's offer. As a result, the New York Power Authority gave the two companies until March 10 to submit new bids. So when March 10 rolled around, each company, naturally, proclaimed its offer to be the better one. Dominion sweetened the pot by saying that it would pay a total of $946 million for the plants, an increase of $89 million. Dominion also offered its full corporate resources as collateral against any unforeseen decommissioning costs, unlike its competitor, which is relying on its Entergy Nuclear subsidiary, a limited liability corporation, and not the parent company in New Orleans, as collateral. But above all, Dominion said that it was simply offering more money. ''What you ought to focus on is the dollars that the citizens of New York State receive,'' said Thos. E. Capps, Dominion's chairman. Entergy did not change the cash component of its original proposal: $806 million. Instead, it announced a new bid of $1.12 billion through an increase of $314 million in projected benefits like paying more money to decommission the plants and selling more electricity at below-market prices to the authority. In addition, Entergy said it should be rewarded for the substantial investments in money and time spent on putting together its offer. ''You have to look at the overall, broader package for the state of New York,'' Mr. Yelverton said. In the last few days, the two companies have offered competing economic models and projections. The latest have Dominion saying it can provide $1.52 billion in cash and speculative benefits and Entergy up to $1.42 billion. The power authority, meanwhile, has tried to stay out of the fray, releasing only the analysis by its consultant, J. P. Morgan. But one thing that should be noted, Mr. Petralia said, is that either offer would pay off the remaining $316 million in debt on Indian Point 3. (The FitzPatrick plant is paid for.) ''Whatever is decided is going to be a tremendous benefit to the state,'' Mr. Petralia said. To date, few nuclear plants have actually changed hands, and when they do, it is usually from one private company to another. Moreover, out of the 100 or so plants still operating in the country, the power authority sale may well be the first one involving the privatization of a publicly run nuclear plant, said Edward Smeloff, executive director of the Pace Law School Energy Project. So the fate of the power authority's plants may well provide a road map on what may eventually happen with the two Millstone plants in Connecticut, as well as to the beleaguered Indian Point 2 plant. ''I think it's important because it gets New York State out of the business of owning a nuclear plant, and I think that, from a large policy perspective, is the right thing to do,'' Mr. Smeloff said.",2000-03-20T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

The deal culminates more than 10 years of sales efforts by Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. It will be the second Canadian reactor built in South Korea. Officials said on Friday that the 700,000-kilowatt power plant, estimated to cost about $1 billion, would be built in Wolsong, 160 miles southeast of Seoul. It will be built next to the first Canadian reactor, which has been operating since 1983. South Korea and Canada are each other's fifth-largest trading partners. Trade between the companies is expected to reach $4 billion in 1990. The Korean power company, known as Kepco, has nine nuclear power plants in operation and two more under construction. The Government expects to have 50 nuclear plants in operation in the next 40 years. A turbine generator for the new plant will be supplied by the General Electric Company, along with the Korea Heavy Industries and Construction Company, under a contract to be signed soon, officials said.

Every plant of the more than 100 ordered since 1973 has been canceled, and many others are approaching retirement. But reactor manufacturers say that fears of global warming - the greenhouse effect - are giving them a second chance. Right now, the American nuclear power industry appears headed for extinction. Every plant of the more than 100 ordered since 1973 has been canceled, and many others are approaching retirement. But reactor manufacturers say that fears of global warming - the greenhouse effect - are giving them a second chance. Nuclear power advocates have, of course, been predicting the industry's rebirth for years. But the plans are becoming more specific, and political calculations are coming into play. Reactor builders are readying designs for a new generation of plants that, they say, will be far safer, less expensive and simpler to operate. The General Electric Company and the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, the two biggest reactor manufacturers, and General Atomic, a small company with an innovative reactor design, each received $50 million from the Department of Energy in September to work on their models. They are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to bring nuclear power back. And they are presenting the opposition with a tantalizing series of ''what-if's.'' * What if fundamental design changes made plants a hundred times safer? So safe that many elaborate safety features in today's plants - equipment that must be radiation-proof, fire-proof, tornado-proof and generally failure-proof - were not needed? * What if all the power and all the pumps and valves could fail, all the operators could be seized with indecision - and the plant would come through without further damage? Designers say such a plant is in their blueprints. * What if, as designers promise, the parts that are most likely to fail were redesigned or even eliminated? If many of the parts that are trickiest to install - like earthquake-proof piping with flawless welds - were drastically reduced? What if cost overruns were the worry of the manufacturer, not the utility and its customers? Would such a reactor sell? * What if plants that were licensed for construction were accepted by the gvernment once built, not subject to costly new requirements before completion, or after? New rules approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and now before Congress would accomplish as much, the industry's boosters say. Even those in the industry agreed that utility companies are unlikely to buy new plants soon. ''Anyone suggests a nuclear reactor to a utility board of directors, they will send for the guy with the net, and with good reason,'' said Shelby T. Brewer, head of the nuclear division at Combustion Engineering Inc. - a reactor manufacturer that has agreed to be bought out by ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd. But the manufacturers, who have been subsisting on paltry foreign sales, say they must prepare for a second nuclear age. With new equipment, new construction procedures and reformed regulation, they say, the orders will come. At Westinghouse, promotional material speaks of a new design ''restoring the domestic market.'' The reactor vendors are counting on growing environmental consciousness and growing demand for electricity. The world's choices of other power sources will be constrained by fears of air pollution and global warming brought on by the burning of coal, oil and gas. As Hans Blix, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, a United Nations agency based in Vienna, asked, ''Are you more scared of nuclear than of adding more carbon dioxide?'' The next few years, reactor manufacturers believe, will bring electricity shortages in this country and higher power needs abroad. Environmentalists are skeptical, suggesting that if there is a high-tech remedy for the greenhouse effect, it probably lies in more efficient light bulbs and motors, or photovoltaic cells and other new generating technologies. It is unclear what the leading technologies will be at the turn of the century, the very earliest that the first of a new generation of nuclear plants might be completed. Environmentalists also point out that even if all the nation's electricity came from reactors, global emissions of carbon dioxide would be cut by only about 3.5 percent. But utility executives say they would like a nuclear option; although mindful of public opposition and the huge cost overruns of the 1970's and 1980's, they are not lining up to buy. At a recent conference on nuclear power and the greenhouse effect, organized by the Institute for Resource Management, an environmental group, many experts said the revival of the industry was a realistic possibility, but that it depended heavily on public opinion. As Alan Crane, senior associate project director at the Office of Technology Assessment put it at the conference: ''You can't just keep the utilities happy. There's a jury of 240 million people out there.'' Though polls show the public believes nuclear power will be important in the future, he said, ''Nobody would countenance one in their own backyard.'' Though some new reactor features have been tested, others exist only on paper. But the industry's basic selling point is that eight pounds of uranium can make as much energy as 6,000 tons of oil or 8,600 tons of coal. A single large reactor could supply 1.5 million households. If that energy had to come from coal, each household would aggravate the greenhouse effect by burning half a ton of coal each month. Among currently economical technologies, only hydroelectric power and perhaps wood replaced by replanting can provide electricity without worsening the greenhouse effect. But both sources are limited. By themselves, these arguments sway few outside the nuclear community. Safety and cost, which killed off the market for the current generation of reactors, still must carry the day. The United States invented the civilian nuclear reactor as a spin-off from the bomb. For decades, in the ''Atoms for Peace'' era, the nuclear industry had a near-messianic tone. The nation's resulting disillusionment was all the more severe. Now American manufacturers say this country can use standardization and other reforms to make nuclear power work again - at least as well as the French, Japanese and Koreans, who all prosper with American designs. ''As we see the world,'' said Bert Wolfe, vice president for nuclear services at General Electric, ''it's hard to see how you can meet the energy needs in the next century without nuclear power.'' General Electric's Simplified Boiling Water Reactor and Westinghouse's Advanced Passive 600 are dramatic departures from the reactors these companies have built before. They are smaller, simpler and more forgiving and reliable. ''Even the current reactors tolerate a lot of stupidities,'' said Mr. Blix, in an interview at the United Nations. ''The ones that will come in the 90's will tolerate even more.'' The designs for the 1990's differ in many ways, but all are only about half as large as the biggest now in service. General Atomic's plan is for even smaller reactors, which would be built in groups of up to four, with all four together only the size of a smallish plant today. A Revolution in Design Down-sizing represents a revolution for reactor manufacturers, who, like auto makers, had long equated size with progress. For years the reactor designs grew larger because manufacturers thought the utilities could achieve economies of scale, generating more power with the same plant staff. But bigger plants took longer to build, raising costs and leaving utilities too dependent on single projects. Utilities also found that they had overestimated power demand for the early 1980's; smaller plants, more quickly built, do not require such accurate long-range projections. Smaller reactors also make it easier to design cooling systems without mechanical pumps or the need for quick action by operators. The other revolution in reactor concepts has been for vendors to complete their designs before they build. In the 1960's, utilities blithely broke ground on plants when only a quarter of the design was in hand, even when the plants were to be three or four times larger than any reactors already operating. ''Fast-tracking'' was the motto, with construction crews pouring foundations while engineers decided, in effect, where to put the kitchen and how many bedrooms to put upstairs. In a period of rapid inflation in building costs and high interest payments on an unfinished project, fast-tracking was meant to save money. Instead, it created confusion and raised costs, as piping ordered by one set of engineers often failed to fit equipment designed by another. Fast-tracking was especially difficult because the first generation of reactors included scores of one-of-a-kind designs. ''We had 50 separate learning curves,'' said Victor Gilinsky, a physicist and former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Virtually every plant was a prototype, and the experience of building one was of little help in building another. And there was no standardization in operations, either. ''It's as if the Navy had allowed every commander to design his own ship, hire his own contractor, designate his own ranks,'' said Mr. Gilinsky. Standardization is essential to swift construction, the experts say. As Howard J. Bruschi, the director of nuclear plant programs at Westinghouse, complained, ''The French are using Westinghouse reactors, and they build them in five years. We've managed to stretch that to 14 in the United States.'' Westinghouse and General Electric are both seeking generic approval for their designs from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by 1995. They also want one-step licensing, to replace the current process of applying for a construction permit and then, after construction is nearly done, applying again, for an operating license. Under the proposed changes, utilities could order a reactor the way a not-too-fussy homebuyer could order a house from stock plans, with only minor adjustments to conform to the particulars of a site. The commission has already approved simplified licensing for standardized plants. Watchdog groups have complained about the potential loss of public say, so the industry wants to head off legal challenges by having Congress write the simplified procedures into law. The new designs confront several other chronic problems of earlier nuclear reactors. Some examples: * In case of accident, existing reactors automatically pump in water to cool the fuel. But a cooling system failure could be catastrophic. New designs by Westinghouse and General Electric depend on gravity and convection to inject cold water and remove heat. * Existing reactors overheat quickly if cooling water flow is interrupted because they squeeze a large amount of fissionable uranium into a small space. Solution: Change the concentration of fissionable uranium in the fuel to lower the concentration of heat produced, by about 40 percent in General Electric plants and 30 percent in Westinghouse plants. * The current plants were plagued with questions about the adequacy of welds. As a result, one $2 billion plant, Zimmer, a General Electric design in Moscow, Ohio, is being converted to coal. Westinghouse has designed a new plant with long, gently curving pipes that have half the welds of a conventional design. * Reactors that boil water directly in the core now use pumps to circulate the water, but the stainless steel piping connected to the pumps has sometimes cracked. General Electric has designed a reactor that relies on natural convection instead of pumps to circulate water. This design also eliminates the need for large pipes to penetrate the reactor vessel below the level of the uranium core, so that if a pipe breaks, the water will not leak out. * Reactors today have emergency diesel generators, which provide power for crucial instruments, pumps and valves in case of a blackout. But the diesels require expensive maintenance and sometimes fail in tests, requiring a plant to close while they are fixed. Westinghouse has designed a plant that it says shuts down safely, dissipating heat with water delivered by gravity, convection and other passive means - without the use of valves, pumps or instruments, and thus without emergency diesel generators. The Cost Contest Even an industry that meets all the safety criteria still faces huge challenges - most of all, cost. With more and more states requiring their utilities to solicit bids for new power supplies, rather than simply building another generating station and charging customers, nuclear will have to compete with new, highly fuel-efficient gas- and oil-fired generators. In extreme cases like New Hampshire's Seabrook nuclear plant, which recently took a major step toward operation, costs reached $5,400 per kilowatt of capacity. About $3,600 was for direct costs, the rest for interest payments. The Electric Power Research Institute, a utility research consortium in Palo Alto, Calif., believes that to be competitive, nuclear plants must be built for $1,500 a kilowatt in direct costs, a target that manufacturers believe they can meet. Westinghouse is convinced that its AP 600 can be built for $1,270 a kilowatt, not counting interest but including a 20 percent contingency fee. To limit costs, the builders of nuclear plants must limit construction time. ''If we're going to be effective with nuclear power,'' said Mr. Bruschi in an interview, ''we have to demonstrate as an industry, unequivocally, that these things can be built in a reasonable amount of time.'' Westinghouse, he said, can fulfill this goal with a strategy not used since the mid-1960's: the ''turnkey'' plant. It is sold at a fixed price, so the builder bears the risk of cost overruns. ''I have been highly encouraged by conversations we've had with utilities,'' said Mr. Bruschi, ''But no single utility is going to stick its neck out. So we're willing to go forward with a turnkey plant.'' The risk might be shared, he said, among Westinghouse, an architecture and engineering firm, and other contractors. Nuclear power opponents raise several other challenges. They question special subsidies and protections for the industry, like the Price-Anderson Act, which limits the liability of reactor operators for accidents. ''What distinguishes nuclear power in benefit to the United States, that it is deserving of such treatment?'' asked Charles Imbrecht, the chairman of the California Energy Commission. The big reactor manufacturers, all of them divisions of larger companies, say Price-Anderson is a necessity for them to continue in the business. But Linden Blue, the vice chairman of General Atomic, said he is so convinced that his reactor could not cause damage beyond the plant boundaries that he would forswear the Price-Anderson benefits. Suspect Subsidies Many energy experts question why the Department of Energy spends so much more to develop nuclear power than solar power or other technologies. Amory B. Lovins, a physicist and expert in electric efficiency, argues that skepticism over vendors' cost claims will persist ''until the promoters pay for that commercialization, and stop importuning the Treasury to put our money where their mouths are.'' If the nuclear companies paid all their development costs, he said, they would build no new reactors. The same funds invested in energy conservation and efficiency would save far more power, he added. Another problem is nuclear waste. California has barred the construction of more reactors until the Federal Government demonstrates a way to dispose of waste. The Department of Energy is making little progress toward its goal of opening a repository early in the next century. Then there are decommissioning costs, unmeasured even for plants now in operation. Also uncertain is how much of a hazard a decommissioned plant would be. As I.C. Bupp, a reactor expert at the Cambridge Energy Research Associates consulting firm, put it: ''The public expects the option to tear it down and make a baseball field. If that option isn't there, I think you're going to have one heck of a political problem.'' The industry is convinced it can meet these objections. The first new reactor, the thinking goes, will be built where others already exist, in a region with scarce coal but growing electric demand. The Southeast, including Florida, might provide a site. Until now, the industry's greatest obstacle has been its own sorry record. But business will revive, industry executives say, when it becomes obvious that a standardized plant can be built quickly, under a licensing system that prevents challenges and changing requirements along the way. With nuclear power in such disrepute, it may take more than just blueprints to persuade a utility to order that first new plant.As Mr. Wolfe of General Electric said, ''Someone is going to have to have faith that the system will work.''",1989-11-26T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business

But the hot idea now is to think small — small enough to fit a reactor on a railroad car or even a heavy-haul truck. Such a reactor could be built in a factory, sidestepping the problems of assuring high-quality fabrication in the field and allowing fast installation. And such reactors would have a built-in safety feature: in an emergency, natural convection could help a small core cool faster than a big one, just the way a cup of coffee cools faster than a pot of coffee. Proponents say that makes meltdowns far less likely. “They offer the potential for a new paradigm in how we think about construction of nuclear power plants,” Peter B. Lyons, the Energy Department’s assistant secretary for nuclear energy, said of the so-called small modular reactors, also known as S.M.R.’s. He is supervising a program under which the government will pay up to half of the development cost of two different models. One manufacturer already has a contract to develop a plan for two small reactors in Tennessee. Because the plants could be safer as well as faster and easier to install, they do not have to surpass big reactors in cost per kilowatt-hour, Mr. Lyons said in an interview. “If it is even equal, it is a winner,” he said. “If it’s better, it’s more than a winner.” Rebecca Smith-Kevern, the Energy Department’s director for light water reactor deployment, estimated their cost at $800 million to $2 billion a unit, compared with $10 billion to $12 billion for a large reactor. “Basically they’re not a bet-the-farm proposition for a utility,” she said. Small modular reactors could serve as “starter reactors” for countries that have no nuclear power now, no budget for a standard behemoth-size model and grids too weak to tolerate one anyway, proponents say. (Put a standard, 1,200-megawatt reactor on a small grid, and it could trigger a nationwide blackout every time it shut down unexpectedly.) In addition to being small enough to ship, the reactors are small enough to be installed underground, offering the advantage of earthquake protection; buried structures are less vulnerable than those above the surface. They may also be easier to defend from attack. And the ability to air-cool the reactors further distinguishes them from big nuclear plants, which, like coal and most natural gas plants that make steam to drive a turbine, require copious amounts of water to condense the steam back to water. S.M.R.’s make steam, like other reactors, but can condense it back to water using something a bit like a car radiator. The Obama administration, with nuclear power aims that have received less attention than its alternative energy initiatives, began a five-year program to develop reactors in 2012, planning to spend $452 million. The budget outlook for the final three years is uncertain, but the incoming energy secretary, Ernest J. Moniz, speaking at his confirmation hearing on April 9, said of small modular reactors: “I think that it’s a very promising direction that we need to pursue. It’s where the most innovation is going on in nuclear energy.” But new approaches to nuclear power have been forecast far more often than they have been realized, and some worry that small modular reactors could fall into that category. Joyce L. Connery, an Energy Department nuclear expert assigned to the National Security Council, remarked at a nuclear power conference in March, “I hope that soon we populate the world with S.M.R.’s as much as we populate the world with conferences about S.M.R.’s.” The economics may still be challenging even if the price tag is smaller, she said. “Clearly there is a need for nuclear energy for the environment, but the environment for nuclear energy is not so great right now,” she told a gathering of several hundred experts organized by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Cheap natural gas in North America and global political fallout from the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan are not helping, experts say. And the regulatory structure is not so great for small reactors. Regulatory commission rules for control-room staff levels, emergency planning zones and security are all predicated on large, aboveground reactors. A small one built mostly underground might logically have smaller requirements, but a potential buyer would be reluctant to build one under the current regulatory regime, experts say. Also, small reactors still face serious scrutiny for safety. David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that the nice thing about reactors that existed only on paper was that the worst damage risk is paper cuts; their weaknesses do not become evident until the design or construction is further along. But many potential manufacturers are advancing their designs. Leading at the moment is the power plant company Babcock & Wilcox, which has a promise of aid from the Energy Department. The Tennessee Valley Authority wants two of the company’s mPower reactors for a site near the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and has agreed to pay for more detailed design work . Babcock’s reactor , 13 feet in diameter and 83 feet high, can produce 180 megawatts of power, about 15 percent of the power of a large new reactor, but can run far longer before refueling is required: four years, the manufacturer says, versus one to two years for a standard reactor. When a utility company needs more power, it can order another. Babcock refers to the basic design as a “two-pack,” as if the reactors were twin boxes of laundry soap. The reactor’s emergency cooling system consists of the natural circulation of air. Conventional reactors require operators to start up pumps and align valves, something that was impossible in the Fukushima accident, when a tsunami wiped out electric power. Company executives hope to sell the mPower reactor to American military bases that would like to become more self-sufficient. At 180 megawatts, it could also be installed at the sites of 1950s-era coal plants that are being retired. Some of the infrastructure in those places, like the transmission lines and transformers, are about the right size for that kind of plant, officials say. But another major market would be exports. According to the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry’s trade association, 5,000 to 10,000 jobs are created for every $1 billion spent in this country for nuclear technology that is exported. Another major player is likely to be NuScale Power , which plans a module with an output of just 45 megawatts. Most reactors use pumps in their ordinary operation, to move the water they’ve heated into heat exchangers, which make clean steam for a turbine. NuScale makes water run to its steam generator with natural circulation, eliminating the pump that is used in conventional plants for that function. Such pumps are expensive and failure-prone. The reactor is small enough to provide the steam needed to run an oil refinery, or even heat for keeping buildings warm. It would sit inside something like a Thermos bottle, submerged in a pool of cold water that could accommodate up to 12 reactors. In case of accident, that cooling water would last for months, the company says. “It needs no A.C. power, no D.C. power, no additional water, indefinitely,” said Michael McGough, a spokesman.",2013-04-25T00:54:55.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

An accident that occurred at a Georgia nuclear power plant on March 21 is focusing renewed attention on one of the most worrisome potential problems at nuclear plants: the loss of electrical power to run the plant and cool its reactor fuel. Officials of the Georgia Power Company say there was no risk to the public in the incident at its Plant Vogtle nuclear power plant. A truck ran into a power pole, cutting off electricity to the plant for 36 minutes. But the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission has organized a 10-member team to investigate the incident just as the commission is reviewing plans submitted by the nation's 113 nuclear generating plants. It is the end of a decadelong effort to establish standards to prevent and respond to such blackouts. Industry officials and the N.R.C. say the complexity of the issue and the enormous differences among plants explain the difficulty in formulating nationwide regulations for dealing with power failures. But some critics, like Robert D. Pollard, a former N.R.C. engineer who is with the Union of Concerned Scientists, say the Vogtle incident offers a glimpse of a larger issue. ''The significance of the event is that it illustrates the danger of the N.R.C. leaving high-priority safety issues unresolved for more than 10 years,'' he said. The union, a nonprofit research organization based in Cambridge, Mass., is often critical of the commission and the industry. The incident began when a construction truck backed into a transformer pole in a switching yard that supplies power to the plant. That cut off power to one of its two units, which was being refueled. 'Never Any Danger' Two backup diesel engines were supposed to kick in if power was lost. One failed to do so and the other was undergoing maintenance. The incident also shut down the other reactor; the regulatory commission is still investigating to determine why. The lack of a functioning backup power system led the plant's officials to declare a ''site area emergency,'' the second highest of four categories developed by the N.R.C. It was only the second such emergency since the categories were developed in 1979. But officials said that despite the potential for serious problems, the emergency ended soon afterward. Seventeen minutes after the truck struck the pole, the emergency was downgraded to an ''alert,'' the third highest category. Shortly afterward the backup generator was started manually. The alert was canceled in about four hours. ''There was never any danger to the public, never any release of radiation and never any danger to employees,'' said Tal Wright, a spokesman for Georgia Power. But there was enough potential for serious problems that the regulatory commission assigned a team to investigate. It was only the agency's fifth such investigation, and it has the potential for effects on nuclear plants nationwide. ''The N.R.C. management felt that this was a good opportunity to take an in-depth look at the station blackout question,'' said Ken Clark, a spokesman for the commission. ''There was for a period of time the potential for the situation to deteriorate, but it did not.'' A 1975 N.R.C. report on reactor safety first focused attention on the problem. In its annual reports for the past decade, the agency has listed blackouts at nuclear power stations as an ''unresolved safety issue.'' In 1988, it developed station blackout guidelines for the industry. 'A Lack of Completeness' But an audit last fall found that initial responses from utilities were often inadequate or inaccurate. A draft letter prepared by the N.R.C. staff said its audit of 10 blackout plans showed ''a lack of completeness and a tendency to interpret or extend the guidance in a manner to justify minimum design changes rather than improved protection against station blackout.'' One proposal, for example, recommended that the control room be evacuated to save power to deal with an emergency. Another cited an analysis that the nuclear panel determined had never been done. The nuclear panel's letter then called for the unusual step of requiring utilities to submit a sworn statement that their response was accurate and adequately documented. An industry group, the Nuclear Management and Resources Council, protested the staff's proposed letter and persuaded the commission to allow it to help utilities comply with the guidelines without having to make sworn statements to the regulatory commission. Russell Bell, a program manager in the technical division of the industry group, said the group had long been involved in the blackout issue and felt the utilities and the N.R.C. would best be served if it provided guidance and assistance to insure a proper response. And he said progress had been made on the issue even though it had taken a long time to develop regulations and for utilities to comply with them. ''It's important to note that in the period we're talking about, the reliability of diesel generators at the nuclear plants, which are the primary defense against blackout, has consistently improved,'' he said. ''What we're dealing with is trying to reduce the risk of an already low-likelihood event.'' But Mr. Pollard said aging plants and generators made the risks greater, not smaller, over time. He noted that the N.R.C.'s own studies showed that at some plants a station blackout was the most likely cause of a serious accident that could damage a plant's core. Mr. Pollard said that by backing off from its tough letter to utilities, the N.R.C. was avoiding its regulatory responsibility. The safe resolution of incidents like the one at Vogtle does not minimize their risks, he said. ''If a drunken driver gets home without having an accident,'' he went on, ''you can't conclude from that there's no safety significance to drunken driving.''",1990-04-01T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

For America, the purpose and test of power is the ability to get things done that protect its security and interests or ward off dangers to them. In the use of power -- economic, political or military -- America can act alone or with allies. What is an ally? Who are America's? And when? Full time? Or as temps, now and then? At a time when Americans are increasingly edgy about using military power, will America use its economic might to protect its security? Will America's allies help? If not, are we willing to use that economic power to force our allies, plus Russia or China, to respect our security and interests -- or at least not interfere with them? If not, is the U.S. still a superpower, or is it playing expensive games of self-delusion? The questions rise out of Iran's plans to produce nuclear power that could be used for nuclear weaponry. The U.S. believes making Iran an economic outcast would stop Teheran. But Russia and China keep selling Iran the technology, materials and specialists of nuclear potential. Western Europe acts as if economic pressure against a terrorist state is an idea indelicate beyond the point of obscenity. Iran now says it is not building one nuclear plant. It plans to build ten over the next two decades. Ten -- that is not simply a number. It is a strategy, defensive and offensive. In 1981 Israel knocked out Iraq's nuclear weapon drive by a surprise strike on one plant. Iran's strategy scatters plants around the country, making a pre-emptive strike virtually impossible. U.S. experts say Iran will be capable of producing material for nuclear weapons in three to five years. And Kenneth Timmerman, the enormously knowledgeable arms expert, reports in The Washington Times that for six years Iran has built stockpiles of uranium and other weapons-grade material, unguarded and uninspected. A nuclear Iran would be a threat to the Persian Gulf states, Israel and Turkey and every other object on its hate list, headed of course by the U.S. Would Iran supply nuclear weapons to its protege terrorist groups? The mere possibility would hugely increase their power. President Clinton did what his predecessors did not: he ordered an embargo on American trade with Iran. That removed Iran from the American market, and a burden of hypocrisy from the U.S. But Germany, Japan, Italy, France and other U.S. allies that have been selling high-technology tools, pesticides or other products so useful in modern war told Mr. Clinton to take his embargo and run along. Communist China and North Korea have not been that courteous. They just send more material, missiles and specialists to Iran. In Moscow, President Yeltsin was appreciative of President Clinton's visit -- but not enough to cancel Russia's deal to build a nuclear plant in Iran, the centerpiece of the new Iranian network. Having cut off its own trade, the U.S. can and should now let our allies, plus Russia and China, know what it will do to persuade them to help prevent a nuclear Iran. Next month at a meeting in Halifax of major industrial nations, including Russia, the U.S. will try again to convince them to join in economic measures against Iran. But they should also be told that if President Clinton fails, either he or Congress will bar imports into the U.S. of companies that do business with Iran -- as formally proposed by Senator Alfonse D'Amato, Representative Peter King and other legislators. Europe would be shocked -- they don't believe Mr. Clinton has it in him. Even Beijing might be less haughty. The companies peddling equipment and specialists to Iran are part of the economic empire of the Chinese Army, which provides a superb cash flow to the Politburo. If Mr. Yeltsin turns the U.S. down again, Washington will have to choose between the likelihood of making more Russian nationalists mad at him and the certainty of making Iran nuclear. Closing U.S. ports to imports of Russian companies and agencies that build Iran's nuclear capability might work. If not -- then suspend American aid. Anything else would turn the U.S. from Mr. Yeltsin's friend to his hostage. The goal is to block Iranian nuclear power. But there's a bonus -- getting some clear answers to the questions in the opening paragraphs of this column.",1995-05-16T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,opinion
ed3673a8-110e-4c67-9527-5194437e445b,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/world/asia/11japan.html,Japan to Cancel Plan to Build More Nuclear Plants,"TOKYO — Prime Minister Naoto Kan said Tuesday that Japan would abandon plans to build more nuclear reactors, saying his country needed to “start from scratch” in creating a new energy policy. Mr. Kan’s announcement came as Japan allowed residents of evacuated areas around the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant to briefly revisit their homes for the first time since the devastating earthquake and tsunami in March caused the nuclear accident at the plant. Tuesday’s decision will mean the abandonment of a plan that the Kan government released last year to build 14 nuclear reactors by 2030 and increase the share of nuclear power in Japan’s electricity supply to 50 percent. Japan currently has 54 reactors that before the earthquake produced 30 percent of its electricity. The cancellation of the planned nuclear plants is the second time that Mr. Kan has suddenly announced big changes in Japanese nuclear policy without the usual endless committee meetings and media leaks that characterize the country’s consensus-driven decision-making process. Mr. Kan appears to be seeking a stronger leadership role after criticism of his government’s sometimes slow and indecisive handling of the Fukushima accident. Last week, Mr. Kan asked a utility company to suspend operations at the Hamaoka nuclear plant, which sits atop an active earthquake fault line, about 120 miles southwest of Tokyo. After three days of delays, the utility, the Chubu Electric Power Company, finally agreed Monday to shut down the plant until a wave wall could be built and other measures taken to strengthen its defenses against earthquakes and tsunamis. The announcement Tuesday came just days after Mr. Kan said Japan remained committed to nuclear power. His apparent pull- back may be driven partly by public opinion, which has significantly soured on nuclear power since the Fukushima accident. Even before the announcement, the disaster had damped the nuclear industry’s hopes for a worldwide revival of reactor building. With demand for electricity and concerns about global warming both growing, the industry had projected rapid expansion, but Japan’s nuclear crisis had already caused several countries to become skittish about nuclear power. Germany, for instance, declared a temporary moratorium on building new plants. Still, several experts and nuclear industry representatives said Tuesday that they expected demand in two important markets — China and India — to remain strong even though those counties had said they would proceed more cautiously. Both nations have rapidly growing demand for electricity, and neither has nearly enough domestic fuel to meet its needs. Nils J. Diaz, a former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and a consultant for companies that want to build reactors, said he did not think the prime minister’s announcement would cause “a domino effect.” And Jonathan Hinze, vice president for international operations at the Ux Consulting Company in Roswell, Ga., which tracks the market for reactors, added that Japan’s suspension of new reactor building was less damaging than it seemed because many in the industry had doubted that Japan would have the demand to justify that much construction. A downturn in reactor construction would hurt Japanese companies that export nuclear plant designs and components, including Toshiba, which owns Westinghouse, and Hitachi, which is in a worldwide partnership with General Electric. Companies in France and South Korea also have a big stake in reactor building. On Tuesday, Mr. Kan said Japan would retain nuclear and fossil fuels as energy sources, but vowed to add two new pillars to Japan’s energy policy: renewable energy and conservation. While Japan has been a global leader in energy conservation, it lags behind the United States and Europe in adopting solar and wind power, and other new energy sources. “We need to start from scratch,” Mr. Kan told reporters. “We need to make nuclear energy safer and do more to promote renewable energy.” The wording seemed to at least leave open the possibility that some new nuclear plants could be built in the future. On Tuesday, Japan was reminded of the human costs of the Fukushima disaster, when the first group of 92 people paid two-hour visits to their homes in Kawauchi, within the 12-mile zone around the plant that was evacuated after the nuclear crisis. The residents wore white antiradiation clothing and traveled in buses under tight supervision by nuclear officials. They retrieved belongings like photo albums and the tablets traditionally used in Japan to honor dead relatives in household Buddhist shrines, according to local media reports. The government appeared to agonize for weeks over whether to allow even brief trips. Officials were concerned about whether civilians could be kept safe from exposure to potentially high radiation doses near the plant. Complicating their decision was the lack of scientific knowledge on the health effects of the radiation doses now found in many of the evacuated areas. Some scientists say radiation levels even in many evacuated areas are too low to cause immediate illness, while others worry that the incidence of cancer could rise over the long term. Last week, the government staged a trial run; officials played the role of returning residents to see if the trips could be made safely. Screened for radiation on their return, those participating were found to have been exposed to a dose of up to 25 microsieverts during the two-hour visit.",2011-05-10T16:45:25.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The move is intended to air out the building that houses Reactor No. 1 to ensure that radiation levels are low enough to allow workers to enter. The plant’s operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, said the procedure would release little radiation into the atmosphere because an air filtering system installed last week had already removed most of the dangerous particles. Eight hours after the doors were opened, workers entered the building to test radiation levels. The next step is to begin replacing the reactor’s cooling system, which was destroyed by the tsunami on March 11. The company has said it will take at least six months to stabilize the plant, in which three of the six reactors were damaged by a magnitude-9.0 earthquake and tsunami. Hydrogen explosions spewed radiation into the atmosphere, causing the worst nuclear disaster since the 1986 Chernobyl accident in Ukraine. Despite the crisis in Japan, Mr. Kan indicated Sunday that his government was not rethinking the nation’s energy policy. There had been speculation that the government might seek to shut down more nuclear plants after Mr. Kan requested last week that the Hamaoka nuclear plant in central Japan be temporarily closed because of safety concerns. Mr. Kan told reporters on Sunday that he would not seek to close any more of Japan’s 54 nuclear reactors. He said the Hamaoka plant, 125 miles west of Tokyo, was “a special case” because it sat atop a major fault line. Government seismologists say there is an almost 90 percent chance of a major earthquake on the fault line within the next 30 years. Critics have long warned of a possible accident at the Hamaoka plant, which is upwind of Tokyo. Mr. Kan asked that the plant be closed until a tsunami-resistant wall could be built and backup systems could be installed to strengthen the plant against earthquakes. The Hamaoka plant’s operator, the Chubu Electric Power Company, accepted the prime minister’s request on Monday. The company’s board did not reach a decision at a meeting on Saturday, when some board members expressed concern about summer power shortages if the plant were shut down. The utility company supplies power to central Japan, including Aichi Prefecture, the home of Toyota. In Tokyo, residents face the prospect of electricity shortages because of the loss of the power supplied by Fukushima Daiichi and other plants in earthquake-damaged northern Japan. Despite the setbacks, Yoshito Sengoku, the deputy chief cabinet secretary, said Japan was not reconsidering its dependence on nuclear power, which supplies about a quarter of the nation’s electricity.",2011-05-09T13:31:25.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

A Presidential order that overrides local safety objections to nuclear power plants was debated at length but withheld until after the Nov. 8 election to avoid possible political consequences, an Administration official familiar with the discussions said today. One reason for the delay, the official said, was concern that Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts might use the order as an issue in his Presidential campaign against Vice President Bush. The executive order, issued Friday by President Reagan, was apparently aimed at eliminating procedural roadblocks to the operation of a long-idle nuclear power station in Seabrook, N.H., only a few miles from the Massachusetts border. Mr. Dukakis has refused to approve emergency evacuation plans for Massachusetts towns near the plant, and his refusal has helped to prevent the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from issuing a full-power operating license to the power station. ''It's an issue he has taken public positions on as Governor of Massachusetts,'' said the Reagan Administration official. ''He had written the White House on this months ago, before he had the nomination in hand.'' 'Why Stir Up an Issue?' He added, ''Why stir up an issue before the election?'' The order gives the Federal Emergency Management Agency the power to draft and carry out emergency plans when state or local officials refuse to assume responsibility for safety measures in nuclear accidents. The Federal agency, which coordinates civil defense and major disaster relief efforts, would be allowed to take over Federal hospitals, troops and communications lines in a nuclear plant accident. Officials of Seabrook, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Shoreham plant on Long Island said today that the order probably comes too late to aid the long-delayed plants. Many of nuclear industry officials say the plants are unlikely ever to generate commercial electric power. Help for Half-Dozen Plants But both Federal officials and their nuclear critics said that the Presidential directive could clear the way for the speedy licensing of some half-dozen plants now under construction or on the drawing boards, even where strong local opposition exists to their operation. The Presidential order was approved in principle earlier this fall, according to several officials who asked not to be identified. It was not approved in final form by President Reagan until after the election. Even when the order was released, the timing suggested that the White House wanted to play down the announcement, a conclusion rejected by one Administration official. The White House released the text of the order without explanation late Friday afternoon. Officials at both the Federal Emergency Mangement Agency and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said they had not been provided with copies of the order. They said could respond to questions about the order only on the basis of earlier drafts of the document. Months of Lobbying Officials said the executive order was the object of many months of lobbying by governors and members of Congress, including Senator Gordon J. Humphrey, Republican of New Hampshire, who personally appealed to Mr. Reagan not to sign it. The order was approved with the strong backing of Energy Secretary John S. Herrington and other lawmakers. Senator J. Bennett Johnston, an Alabama Democrat who heads the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and is a strong advocate of nuclear power, had earlier supported such an order. ''It all went through the regular White House circulation,'' one senior official, who sought anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic, said today. ''We all knew it was coming through, but this is something that's been in the pipeline for a long, long time.'' Several Government officials, including Mr. Herrington, have said the Government wanted to make it easier for the Shoreham and Seabrook plants to start producing power. But it was not entirely clear why the executive branch waited to issue the order until it would have little impact on either plant. In interviews today, some Administration officials disputed the view that the order comes too late to help the Shoreham and Seabrook plants. Step in 'Right Direction' Paul Turner, a vice president of the United States Council for Energy Awareness, a trade association of the nuclear industry, said the order could function as ''a backup'' at Seabrook. But he said it was important for other reasons. ''This is a step in the right direction,'' Mr. Turner said. ''It's very clear Congress never intended that somebody could use the emergency planning process as a mechanism for obstructing the plant.'' The director of the Safe Energy Communication Council, a coalition of 13 environmental groups led by the Sierra Club and the Environmental Policy Institute, said the order will help ''a new generation of nuclear power plants that can come on line with no public oversight.'' The director, Scott G. Denman, accused the Reagan Administration of deserting its conservative heritage by usurping the states' powers for the sake of promoting the nuclear industry. But Administration officials rejected that criticism, saying the executive order makes sensible and long-needed changes in the basic rules governing commercial nuclear power stations. One law that is a basis of the executive order, the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, specifies the Federal role in state safety issues. ''The statute indicates that the states should be allowed, whenever possible, to carry out their traditional health and safety roles, with the Federal Government stepping in only as a last resort,'' Douglas Kmiec, the Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's office of legal counsel, said in an interview.",1988-11-20T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

Ukrainian government officials said Wednesday that damage by Russian forces had left the former Chernobyl nuclear power plant “disconnected” from outside electricity, leaving the site of the worst nuclear accident in history dependent on power from diesel generators. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations agency on nuclear power, said Wednesday that it saw “no critical impact on safety” at the complex. The American Nuclear Society, a professional group, agreed. “The loss of power is a serious matter but it does not pose a threat to the public,” it said in a statement. But officials warned that the situation around the plant, where there was an explosion and fire at one of the reactors in 1986, was still of grave concern. The plant has not produced electricity since the last of its four reactors was shut down in 2000, but if its generators stopped working, that could affect the operations to store the large quantities of radioactive nuclear waste there. Since the plant was captured by Russian forces not long after the invasion began last month, the I.A.E.A. has said that there have been interruptions in the feed of data it receives automatically from radiation monitors and other sensors at the plant. A full loss of power would cut that feed completely, leaving the agency’s experts with little knowledge of what is going on there, except what could be gathered using portable devices. On Tuesday, the I.A.E.A. said it had lost communications with its sensors at the plant. The most hazardous waste at Chernobyl is found in two locations. As is common practice in the nuclear power industry, used fuel from all four reactors is stored in pools of water that dissipates the heat produced as the fuel decays radioactively. When fuel is newly removed from a reactor, there is a lot of decay and thus a lot of heat, so plants need power to run pumps that circulate the storage water to remove excess heat. The I.A.E.A. has said that the used fuel assemblies at Chernobyl — there are more than 20,000 of them — are old enough and decayed enough that circulating pumps are not needed to keep them safe. “The heat load of the spent fuel storage pool and the volume of cooling water contained in the pool is sufficient to maintain effective heat removal without the need for electrical supply,” the agency said. The other main source of nuclear waste are the ruins of the destroyed reactor itself. An estimated 200 tons of fuel remain there, in a lava-like mix with molten concrete, sand and chemicals that were dumped on the reactor during the disaster. This mixture is found throughout the remains of the reactor. Some parts of it are completely inaccessible and have only been studied by boring into them. A functioning reactor requires pumps that circulate water around the core, keeping it cool and moderating the nuclear reaction to avoid a meltdown. There is no cooling water in the chaotic, jumbled remains of the reactor, so the loss of power would not affect them. But in recent years there have been incidents in which nuclear reactions have started spontaneously in pockets of these fuel-containing materials, leading to spikes in radiation levels. Without monitoring — of humidity in addition to radiation levels — workers would not know if any new incident was occurring. Since 2017, the destroyed reactor has been covered by a large arched structure, intended to confine the waste and safeguard against any release of radiation. The structure is also meant to allow the work of removing waste to long-term storage. The facility was only granted an operating license by Ukraine’s authorities last year, so that work had only just begun, and will take decades to complete. There are several large cranes and other specialized equipment to allow crews to work safely. Without power, most if not all of that work could not proceed. On Wednesday, Russia’s Energy Ministry said that Belarus, whose border is not far from the Chernobyl zone, was working on restoring the power supply of the complex from its own grid. William J.

The megawattage was higher than normal, but the politics sounded familiar when Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, with Democratic politicians and antinuclear activists in tow, dropped a rhetorical bomb on the Indian Point nuclear power plant on Monday. Not only should the Nuclear Regulatory Commission deny an application to renew its license, Mr. Cuomo said, but “Indian Point should be closed, and it should be closed now.” For those who missed the urgency, he added, “Indian Point is, in my opinion, a catastrophe waiting to happen.” Well, an ambitious Democratic politician in these parts can never go wrong railing against Indian Point  the more apocalyptic the language, the better. But even in the kingdom where the word “no” forever reigns supreme, closing Indian Point raises its share of vexing questions. For starters: Is New York prepared to increase carbon emissions and perhaps flunk its goals under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to close Indian Point? In whose neighborhoods in Westchester or Rockland Counties is it prepared to build the power plants that would replace it? Is the possibility of more expensive and less reliable electricity an acceptable trade-off for not having to worry about Indian Point? If Indian Point poses an unacceptable risk, shouldn’t the dozens of nuclear plants in metropolitan areas around the country and the world close as well? And we’re comfortable with those carbon trade-offs too? In the end, they come down to this: Do the forever-green, antinuke politics of the 1970s hold up in the global warming era of 2007? Think before you answer. NUCLEAR power isn’t the most lovable of alternatives, and if you live in Westchester County, as I do, the specter of Indian Point is one of the constants of local discourse, like college admissions hysteria, real estate anxiety and Bill and Hillary sightings. Indian Point’s critics say its safety record over the years has been too flawed, the population around it too large, the evacuation plans too inadequate to keep it open. You think, if they can’t get the sirens to operate, maybe there are bigger worries. (Of course, it was New York State that sold this alleged catastrophe in the making to its current owners just six years ago, but we’ll let that pass.) There’s plenty of hyperbole on both sides, and Entergy Nuclear, the plant’s owner, seems able to spend money like a drunken sailor to get its message out. Nuclear power’s most effective spokesman may be Patrick Moore, a founder and former member of the environmental group Greenpeace, who has been hired by the nuclear industry to promote the technology. He says the resurgence of nuclear energy around the world  even in ultragreen countries like Finland  reflects the simple fact that nuclear power has more potential to replace and reduce carbon emissions than anything else, and that, leaving out the Model T technology of Chernobyl, its worldwide safety record remains almost impeccable. “What drives me nuts,” he said, “ is that the environmental movement itself has become the primary obstacle to reducing fossil fuel emissions. Energy and climate are two sides of the same coin, and they’ve got it completely backward. Either you quit worrying about climate change and go on burning fossil fuels or you accept nuclear energy and get off fossil fuels. They’re stuck between a rock and a hard place of their own making.” Of course, if you factor in conservation and alternative energy, there should be other options. And maybe the biggest obstacle to nuclear power has been cost, not pesky enviros. But for now, all the painless green alternatives like massive conservation, smart building, solar power, wind power, ocean waves and the rest that are supposed to allow us to do without nuclear power are still minor parts of the equation. Unless Mr. Cuomo succeeds in closing Indian Point tomorrow, we might hope for two things as its relicensing process plods on. One, says Alex Matthiessen, president of Riverkeeper in Westchester, is a far more thorough hearing than the Nuclear Regulatory Commission seems to have in mind  one that looks at issues like evacuation plans, vulnerability to terrorist attacks, potential leaks from spent fuel pools and other issues. A 20-year renewal for a nuclear plant in the most populous part of the country shouldn’t be a rubber stamp. The second is some kind of urgency about all the painless alternatives that are supposed to let us do without Indian Point and plants like it. As it is, we don’t want windmills off Long Island, and we don’t want the proposed Broadwater floating natural gas plant in Long Island Sound. We almost certainly don’t want a tunnel under the Sound. We don’t want Indian Point, and we sure as heck wouldn’t want a substantial plant to replace it. We want our bloated S.U.V.s and Hummers and the energy-hogging McMansions that the banks haven’t taken back. yet. Maybe Santa is out there 365 days a year, and maybe we can turn all of Wyoming into a windmill farm that will solve everyone’s problems. Or maybe getting to a sane energy future is a lot more complicated than scaring people to death about Indian Point.",2007-12-09T06:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,new

The plant, Takahama Nuclear Power Plant, had been back online for only two months after an extended freeze on atomic power in Japan in the aftermath of the March 2011 Fukushima disaster. Japan’s government and its power companies have struggled to get the nuclear industry back on its feet. Despite new safety standards introduced in 2013, much of the public remains wary. Only a handful of the more than 40 operable reactors in the country have met the new rules, and lawsuits have made it difficult to restart them. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government sees a revival of nuclear power as critical to supporting economic growth and slowing an exodus of Japanese manufacturing to lower-cost countries. Electricity prices have risen by 20 percent or more since the Fukushima disaster because of increased imports of fossil fuels, though the recent drop in oil prices has taken some of the pressure off. The court ruling on Wednesday added a new twist to the legal battles over nuclear power. Judges have enjoined idled plants from being put back into service, but the judgment against Takahama was the first in which a facility that had successfully been restarted was ordered to shut down. Takahama’s owner, Kansai Electric Power Company, brought one reactor at the facility back online in January and another last month. The court, which is in Otsu, Shiga Prefecture, said neither restart should have happened. It was responding to a request for an injunction filed by residents, who said the plant’s owner had underestimated the size of earthquakes that could strike the plant and had not made adequately detailed plans to evacuate people living nearby in case of an accident. Government safety regulators say Takahama meets Japan’s new safety guidelines, which address such issues. But the court ruled for the plaintiffs, saying there were “points of concern in accident prevention, emergency response plans and the formulation of earthquake models.” Kansai Electric said it would appeal. It has won previous appeals against injunctions issued against its plants, including Takahama. The company overcame a separate lawsuit to bring the plant online in January. Takahama is in Fukui Prefecture, a stronghold for the atomic power industry that is home to 13 commercial reactors and that has earned the nickname Genpatsu Ginza, or Nuclear Alley. But the latest lawsuit was filed by residents of the neighboring Shiga Prefecture, who said they would be affected by radiation from a serious accident at Takahama.

Credit... Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Power has again been restored at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility, reducing worries about an accident at one of the war’s most sensitive sites, but the head of the United Nations’ atomic watchdog said late on Friday that the situation was dangerous and warned that workers were under intense pressure to report to Moscow. Moscow has said it was nationalizing the plant, part of a broader effort to claim, in a parade of formalities designed to give the moves a sheen of legitimacy, that parts of Ukraine are now Russian. President Vladimir V. Putin declared this month that four Ukrainian provinces, including Zaporizhzhia, had been annexed to Russia — a move that has been widely rejected and condemned as illegal. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in a statement that employees at the nuclear plant were facing “unacceptable pressure” to sign contracts with the Russian nuclear energy company, Rosatom, in defiance of Kyiv. Mr. Grossi, who met with Mr. Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine this week, said that he “made clear that the staff must be allowed to carry out their vital tasks without undue interference or pressure.” Ukrainian officials have noted the fatigue and stress of the plant’s control room employees, saying that Russian soldiers had subjected them to harsh interrogations, including torture. Ukraine’s state energy company, Energoatom, said on the Telegram messaging app on Saturday that it had set up a hotline for workers at the plant that could be used by “everyone who has information about cases of kidnapping and torture” by Russian authorities. In a “much needed development,” the Ukrainian engineers who have been working at the Zaporizhzhia site under intense Russian pressure had managed to restore backup power, ending the plant’s reliance on diesel generators. Most nuclear power plants consider diesel generators a last line of defense to be used only in extreme circumstances. It was the second time in recent days that shelling had cut power lines that feed the cooling systems for the plant’s six reactors, all of which are shut down. The war marks the first time that a nuclear facility has become an active battle zone. Russia has stationed troops and artillery at the plant since seizing it in March. Ukrainian authorities say the Russians have shelled nearby cities from the plant’s grounds, aware of the risk of returning fire. A waste storage site has been hit several times, and power lines have been a frequent target. Each side has blamed the other for the attacks. “Working in very challenging conditions, operating staff at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant are doing everything they can to bolster its fragile off-site power situation,” Mr. Grossi said. “Restoring the backup power connection is a positive step in this regard, even though the overall nuclear safety and security situation remains precarious.” The Zaporizhzhia plant is not providing electricity to Ukraine’s grid, given that its reactors are shut down, but it needs its own power source for safety reasons. Workers have been wrestling for weeks with how to provide that. Mr. Grossi said that work to restart one of the reactors would begin on Saturday in a process that would take several days. In addition, more diesel fuel has arrived, from both the Ukrainian and Russian side of the front line, to power Zaporizhzhia’s generators for at least 10 days should the plant again be cut off, he said. Mr. Grossi has pushed for the creation of a safety and security zone around the plant. The plan faces obstacles, not least because it would mean Russia would have to cede military control of a critical piece of Ukraine’s infrastructure.",2022-10-15T14:00:24.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

If it carries them out fully and promptly, they could go a long way toward easing international concerns. Yet Iran has been less than candid about its nuclear activities in the past and appears to have used the cover of a civilian nuclear power program to develop weapons-building capacity. Therefore, it bears the burden of convincing the world that it has no intention of producing nuclear weapons, now or in the future. In yesterday's joint statement with the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany, Iran declared it would voluntarily refrain from uranium enrichment -- a process that, depending on how it is done, can produce fuel for civilian power reactors or nuclear weapons. Iran also pledged to sign and ratify an international agreement allowing surprise inspections of its nuclear plants. And it declared itself willing to resolve all unanswered questions about its past nuclear activities to the satisfaction of the International Atomic Energy Agency. With this statement, Tehran has responded to the main requirements of an Oct. 31 deadline imposed by the international community. That is welcome. Yet Iran needs to go further. Uranium imports should be suspended along with uranium enrichment. Centrifuges that can be used for enriching uranium should be dismantled, and no new ones imported or built. It should also be kept in mind that Iran's elected government does not always speak for all of the country's power centers. Its religious leadership must also see to it that the latest pledges are fully honored in letter and spirit. It is troubling that a cleric involved in the negotiations yesterday emphasized that the suspension of uranium enrichment might not be permanent and that none of Iran's latest promises were final until ratified by Parliament. Russia also needs to put constructive pressure on Tehran by delaying the completion of the nuclear power reactor that Moscow is building for Iran at Bushehr. The reactor should not become operational until Tehran agrees that all enrichment of its uranium fuel will be done outside Iranian territory in plants under full international safeguards. Iran must also agree that the plutonium produced by the reactor's operation will be sent abroad. Such agreements protecting the enriched uranium and plutonium associated with nuclear power generation from diversion to weapons should be an essential condition of all future reactor sales to non-nuclear weapons states, not just to Iran. The problem posed by Iran is particularly urgent because it is now widely assumed that Iranian scientists have already learned how to convert natural uranium into bomb fuel. That leaves only one sure way for Iran to persuade others to trust its repeated promises not to build nuclear weapons. It must not only suspend uranium enrichment, but also dismantle, with international verification, all of its enrichment plants.",2003-10-22T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,opinion
c0b8aada-bddb-47c8-a758-7796c2f02318,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/31/world/asia/a-maverick-former-japanese-prime-minister-goes-antinuclear.html,Ex-Leader of Japan Turns Nuclear Foe,"TOKYO — William Zeller, a petty officer second class in the United States Navy, was one of hundreds of sailors who rushed to provide assistance to Japan after a giant earthquake and tsunami set off a triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in 2011. Not long after returning home, he began to feel sick. Today, he has nerve damage and abnormal bone growths, and blames exposure to radiation during the humanitarian operation conducted by crew members of the aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan. Neither his doctors nor the United States government has endorsed his claim or those of about 400 other sailors who attribute ailments including leukemia and thyroid disease to Fukushima and are suing Tokyo Electric, the operator of the plant. But one prominent figure is supporting the American sailors: Junichiro Koizumi, the former prime minister of Japan. Mr. Koizumi, 74, visited a group of the sailors, including Petty Officer Zeller, in San Diego in May, breaking down in tears at a news conference. Over the past several months, he has barnstormed Japan to raise money to help defray some of their medical costs. The unusual campaign is just the latest example of Mr. Koizumi’s transformation in retirement into Japan’s most outspoken opponent of nuclear power. Though he supported nuclear power when he served as prime minister from 2001 to 2006, he is now dead set against it and calling for the permanent shutdown of all 54 of Japan’s nuclear reactors, which were taken offline after the Fukushima disaster. “I want to work hard toward my goal that there will be zero nuclear power generation,” Mr. Koizumi said in an interview in a Tokyo conference room. The reversal means going up against his old colleagues in the governing Liberal Democratic Party as well as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who are pushing to get Japan, once dependent for about a third of its energy on nuclear plants, back into the nuclear power business. That Mr. Koizumi would take a contrarian view is perhaps not surprising. He was once known as “the Destroyer” because he tangled with his own party to push through difficult policy proposals like privatization of the national postal service. Mr. Koizumi first declared his about-face on nuclear power three years ago , calling for Japan to switch to renewable sources of energy like solar power and arguing that “there is nothing more costly than nuclear power.” After spending the first few years of his retirement out of the public eye, in recent months Mr. Koizumi has become much more vocal about his shift, saying he was moved to do more by the emotional appeal of the sailors he met in San Diego. Scientists are divided about whether radiation exposure contributed to the sailors’ illnesses. The Defense Department, in a report commissioned by Congress, concluded that it was “ implausible ” that the service members’ ailments were related to radiation exposure from Fukushima. To many political observers, Mr. Koizumi’s cause in retirement is in keeping with his unorthodox approach in office, when he captivated Japanese and international audiences with his blunt talk, opposition to the entrenched bureaucracy and passion for Elvis Presley . Some wonder how much traction he can get with his antinuclear campaign, given the Abe administration’s determination to restart the atomic plants and the Liberal Democratic Party’s commanding majority in Parliament. Two reactors are already back online; to meet Mr. Abe’s goal of producing one-fifth of the country’s electricity from nuclear power within the next 15 years, about 30 of the existing 43 reactors would need to restart. (Eleven reactors have been permanently decommissioned.) A year after the Fukushima disaster, antinuclear fervor led tens of thousands of demonstrators to take to the streets of Tokyo near the prime minister’s residence to register their anger at the government’s decision to restart the Ohi power station in western Japan. Public activism has dissipated since then, though polls consistently show that about 60 percent of Japanese voters oppose restarting the plants. “The average Japanese is not that interested in issues of energy,” said Daniel P. Aldrich, professor of political science at Northeastern University. “They are antinuclear, but they are not willing to vote the L.D.P. out of office because of its pronuclear stance.” Sustained political protest is rare in Japan, but some analysts say that does not mean the antinuclear movement is doomed to wither. “People have to carry on with their lives, so only so much direct action can take place,” said Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University in Tokyo. Antinuclear activism “may look dormant from appearances, but it’s there, like magma,” he said. “It’s still brewing, and the next trigger might be another big protest or political change.” Some recent signs suggest the movement has gone local. In October, Ryuichi Yoneyama was elected governor in Niigata, the prefecture in central Japan that is home to the world’s largest nuclear plant, after campaigning on a promise to fight efforts by Tokyo Electric to restart reactors there. Like Mr. Koizumi, he is an example of how the antinuclear movement has blurred political allegiances in Japan. Before running for governor, Mr. Yoneyama had run as a Liberal Democratic candidate for Parliament. Mr. Koizumi, a conservative and former leader of the Liberal Democrats, may have led the way. “Originally, the nuclear issue was a point of dispute between conservatives and liberals,” said Yuichi Kaido, a lawyer and leading antinuclear activist. “But after Mr. Koizumi showed up and said he opposed nuclear power, other conservatives realized they could be against nuclear power.” Since he visited the sailors in San Diego, Mr. Koizumi has traveled around Japan in hopes of raising about $1 million for a foundation he established with another former prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, an independent who has previously been backed by the opposition Democratic Party, to help pay some of the sailors’ medical costs. Mr. Koizumi is not involved in the sailors’ lawsuit, now before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. Tokyo Electric is working to have the case moved to Japan. Aimee L. Tsujimoto, a Japanese-American freelance journalist, and her husband, Brian Victoria, an American Buddhist priest now living in Kyoto, introduced Mr. Koizumi to the plaintiffs. Petty Officer Zeller, who said he took painkillers and had tried acupuncture and lymph node massages to treat his conditions, said the meeting with Mr. Koizumi was the first time that someone in power had listened to him. “This is a man where I saw emotion in his face that I have not seen from my own doctors or staff that I work with, or from my own personal government,” said Petty Officer Zeller, who works at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego. “Nobody has put the amount of attention that I saw in his eyes listening to each word, not just from me, but from the other sailors who have gone through such severe things healthwise.” Mr. Koizumi, whose signature leonine hairstyle has gone white since his retirement, said that after meeting the sailors in San Diego, he had become convinced of a connection between their health problems and the radiation exposure. “These sailors are supposed to be very healthy,” he said. “It’s not a normal situation. It is unbelievable that just in four or five years that these healthy sailors would become so sick.” “I think that both the U.S. and Japanese government have something to hide,” he added. Many engineers, who argue that Japan needs to reboot its nuclear power network to lower carbon emissions and reduce the country’s dependence on foreign fossil fuels, say Mr. Koizumi’s position is not based on science. “He is a very dramatic person,” said Takao Kashiwagi, a professor at the International Research Center for Advanced Energy Systems for Sustainability at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. “He does not have so much basic knowledge about nuclear power, only feelings.” That emotion is evident when Mr. Koizumi speaks about the sailors. Wearing a pale blue gabardine jacket despite Japan’s black-and-gray suit culture, he choked up as he recounted how they had told him that they loved Japan despite what they had gone through since leaving. “They gave their utmost efforts to help the Japanese people,” he said, pausing to take a deep breath as tears filled his eyes. “I am no longer in government, but I couldn’t just let nothing be done.”",2016-12-31T18:29:28.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Ukrainian government officials said Wednesday that damage by Russian forces had left the former Chernobyl nuclear power plant “disconnected” from outside electricity, leaving the site of the worst nuclear accident in history dependent on power from diesel generators. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations agency on nuclear power, said Wednesday that it saw “no critical impact on safety” at the complex. The American Nuclear Society, a professional group, agreed. “The loss of power is a serious matter but it does not pose a threat to the public,” it said in a statement. But officials warned that the situation around the plant, where there was an explosion and fire at one of the reactors in 1986, was still of grave concern. The plant has not produced electricity since the last of its four reactors was shut down in 2000, but if its generators stopped working, that could affect the operations to store the large quantities of radioactive nuclear waste there. Since the plant was captured by Russian forces not long after the invasion began last month, the I.A.E.A. has said that there have been interruptions in the feed of data it receives automatically from radiation monitors and other sensors at the plant. A full loss of power would cut that feed completely, leaving the agency’s experts with little knowledge of what is going on there, except what could be gathered using portable devices. On Tuesday, the I.A.E.A. said it had lost communications with its sensors at the plant. The most hazardous waste at Chernobyl is found in two locations. As is common practice in the nuclear power industry, used fuel from all four reactors is stored in pools of water that dissipate the heat produced as the fuel decays radioactively. When fuel is newly removed from a reactor, there is a lot of decay and thus a lot of heat, so plants need power to run pumps that circulate the storage water to remove excess heat. The I.A.E.A. has said that the used fuel assemblies at Chernobyl — there are more than 20,000 of them — are old enough and decayed enough that circulating pumps are not needed to keep them safe. “The heat load of the spent fuel storage pool and the volume of cooling water contained in the pool is sufficient to maintain effective heat removal without the need for electrical supply,” the agency said. The other main source of nuclear waste are the ruins of the destroyed reactor itself. An estimated 200 tons of fuel remain there, in a lava-like mix with molten concrete, sand and chemicals that were dumped on the reactor during the disaster. This mixture is found throughout the remains of the reactor. Some parts of it are completely inaccessible and have only been studied by boring into them. A functioning reactor requires pumps that circulate water around the core, keeping it cool and moderating the nuclear reaction to avoid a meltdown. There is no cooling water in the chaotic, jumbled remains of the reactor, so the loss of power would not affect them. But in recent years there have been incidents in which nuclear reactions have started spontaneously in pockets of these fuel-containing materials, leading to spikes in radiation levels. Without monitoring — of humidity in addition to radiation levels — workers would not know if any new incident was occurring. Since 2017, the destroyed reactor has been covered by a large arched structure, intended to confine the waste and safeguard against any release of radiation. The structure is also meant to allow the work of removing waste to long-term storage. The facility was only granted an operating license by Ukraine’s authorities last year, so that work had only just begun, and will take decades to complete. There are several large cranes and other specialized equipment to allow crews to work safely. Without power, most if not all of that work could not proceed. On Wednesday, Russia’s Energy Ministry said that Belarus, whose border is not far from the Chernobyl zone, was working on restoring the power supply of the complex from its own grid. William J.

Rasmussen, a former professor of nuclear engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who pioneered a technique for measuring risk at nuclear power plants, died on July 18 at a nursing home in Concord, Mass. He was 75. The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, his son, Neil E. Rasmussen, said. In 1975 Dr. Rasmussen oversaw the production of a landmark report, the 21-volume Reactor Safety Study, sponsored by the Atomic Energy Commission, a precursor of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The report predicted that in power reactors in this country, a core damage accident would occur only once in every 20,000 years of operation, with one reactor running for one year counting as a year of operating experience. But after the partial meltdown of the Three Mile Island 2 reactor in Pennsylvania in 1979, when the nuclear industry in this country had fewer than 500 years of operating experience, a new study ordered by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reassessed the risk and estimated it at one meltdown per 1,000 years of reactor operation. The commission disavowed some of the findings of the Rasmussen study. But it continued to embrace his technique, now known as probabilistic risk assessment, which involved drawing up a ''fault tree'' to trace how problems can spread through a plant when a piece of equipment fails. Among the problems with the Rasmussen study were that it overlooked some risks, like fires, and that it was based on reactor designs that did not include the Three Mile Island type. Dr. Rasmussen was a professor of nuclear engineering at M.I.T. from 1958 until 1994, and was in charge of the institute's nuclear engineering department from 1975 to 1981. In 1985, the government presented him with the Enrico Fermi Award for his ''pioneering contributions to nuclear energy in the development of probabilistic risk assessment techniques that have provided new insights and led to new developments in nuclear power plant safety.'' Born in Harrisburg, Pa., Dr. Rasmussen served in the Navy from June 1945 to August 1946 and graduated from Gettysburg College in 1950. He received a Ph.D. in physics from M.I.T. in 1956.

In acrimonious debate before a Senate panel today, opponents and backers of the nuclear power plant at Shoreham, L.I., demonstrated that the gulf between them has grown wider than ever. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, was at times rough in his questioning of spokesmen for Shoreham and the nuclear industry before the Senate subcommittee on nuclear regulation. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, appearing as a witness, said, ''I oppose nuclear energy'' because ''man has not sufficiently mastered the technology of the atom to justify the siting of nuclear power plants anywhere on earth, let alone in highly populated communities.'' Other witnesses argued that the outcome of the controversy over Shoreham and similar plants would prove critical, not only for New York, but also for the energy needs of the United States, the balance between state and Federal rights and the safety of millions of Americans. The topic of today's hearing was a rule change being considered by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The change is considered pivotal to the future of both Shoreham and the nuclear plant at Seabrook, N.H. After the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island, the commission required that emergency evacuation plans be prepared, with the participation of local and state officials, at all commercial nuclear plants. But New York and Suffolk County officials have refused to take part in planning for the $4.6 billion plant on the North Shore of Long Island, arguing that no safe evacuation is possible. The opening of the $4.5 billion Seabrook nuclear power plant has been similarly blocked. Although New Hampshire is cooperating with the utilities that own that plant, officials of neighboring Massachusetts have withdrawn from the planning process. The proposed rule change would clear the way for the commission to license these and other nuclear plants where the only obstacle to opening is local opposition. 'I Withdraw the Remark' At one point during the all-day hearing, George W. Edwards Jr., chairman of the United Illuminating Company, a Connecticut utility and one of Seabrook's owners, suggested that many elected officials have taken anti-nuclear positions as a matter of political expedience. ''This is a nation of heroes,'' he said, ''but unfortunately we have our share of cowards.'' Mr. Moynihan removed his glasses, tapped them sharply on the desk and glared. ''Cowards?'' he shouted. ''What kind of talk is this before members of the Senate? Name a coward. Name one or withdraw the remark.'' Sheepishly, Mr. Edwards said, ''I withdraw the remark.'' On the other side of the issue, Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming and a panel member, said that those states refusing to try to work out an emergency plan were using the rule promulgated after Three Mile Island to take control of the nation's nuclear policy. The rule requiring local participation, he said, ''was not intended to give states and localities veto power.'' He said it was ''critical to the nuclear industry'' that the rule be changed and that a local veto not be established. Mr. Moynihan objected to ''the notion that there is some attempt to close down the nuclear industry because there is one or two sites where we say, no, you can't get out of there.'' He added: ''That's not a veto, that's judgment. You can't get out of eastern Long Island.'' W. Taylor Reveley 3d, a lawyer representing the Long Island Lighting Company, Shoreham's owner, responded that current regulations require an evacuation of only those people living within 10 miles of the plant. ''If you need to evacuate all of easten Long Island then you would also need to evacuate all of New York City in case of an accident at Indian Point,'' he said, referring to the nuclear power plant north of the city. ''And that's certainly not possible.'' Two top officials of the Federal Emergency Management Agency also appeared before the hearing. Under tough questioning, they stopped short of taking sides in the debate.",1987-05-08T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

Along with “Chernobyl,” it lurks in the backs of our minds as a symbol of the unthinkable. Maybe if we just forget, we tell ourselves, everything will somehow turn out all right. Yet, from most evidence, the crisis appears to be far from over. The dread factor is one reason few will want to watch Atsushi Funahashi’s new documentary , “Nuclear Nation,” about the effects of the catastrophe on everyday people. This modest film observes evacuees from Futaba, a small town near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant , making do in their temporary shelter. Partly because this version of the movie was drastically edited to 96 minutes from 145, it feels sketchy and disjointed. “Nuclear Nation” doesn’t take the long view. It doesn’t pretend to be knowledgeable about nuclear power or the politics of the disaster, although the Japanese government and the Tokyo Electric Power Company come off as untrustworthy and indifferent. If nothing else, the film will force you to reassess all the arguments for and against nuclear power. Those whose lives were uprooted seem remarkably stoic, although anger simmers below their resignation at being buffeted by forces beyond their control. And, in one scene of a rally, they vent their frustration. Most of the evacuees, also known as nuclear refugees, are middle-aged or older people who have been relocated from Futaba to an abandoned four-story high school in Saitama, a suburb of Tokyo. Crowded in dormitory-like conditions, subsisting on bento box meals, they await word that never comes of when they might return to their homes in what is now a ghost town. Their numbers dwindle over the months, from more than 1,400 to fewer than half that, as they build new lives in new places. Some of the saddest scenes show residents who are allowed to return briefly to pick up belongings. Donning protective gear and making the bus trip home, they are given two hours to collect sentimental treasures like wedding pictures and favorite pieces of clothing. Katsutaka Idogawa, who was Futaba’s quietly heartbroken mayor, recalls the economic benefits the Fukushima plant once brought to Futaba and the pride that residents felt in being a nuclear power center. But the official response to the evacuees, many of whom haven’t been tested for radiation exposure, was so tepid that any trust has been broken. Some assume that they were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation long before the disaster. It should go without saying that Mr. Idogawa is no longer an advocate of nuclear energy.",2013-12-10T23:20:18.000+01:00,NYTIMES,culture-movies

Brons, a nuclear engineer, would become president and chief operating officer. Mr. Brons had been executive vice president in charge of the authority's two nuclear plants since 1987; for six years before that, he was the resident manager of the Indian Point 3 plant, in Buchanan. Richard M. Flynn, the authority chairman, said Mr. Brons was ""eminently qualified to head our staff in the challenging period ahead."" Mr. Brons, who is 53 years old, replaces Phillip Bayne, who left to become president and chief operating officer of the nuclear industry's public relations arm, the United States Council for Energy Awareness, in Washington. The Power Authority supplies governments and government agencies, from the Transit Authority to libraries and city halls, and buys bulk supplies from Hydro-Quebec for resale to utilities. It operates 11 power plants, mostly hydroelectric, and 1,400 circuit miles of transmission lines. More recently, it has been hired to supervise the decommissioning of the Shoreham nuclear plant, on Long Island. Mr. Brons, the former captain of the nuclear attack submarine Richard B. Russell, takes over at a time that the Power Authority is unlikely to build nuclear plants. It may not build any generating stations in the next few years, although it is now completing another big construction project, a new cable to Long Island. Its main controversy is likely to be whether to buy additional power from Hydro-Quebec, which is planning to enlarge its James Bay project and build massive new dams to meet demand in New York and elsewhere in the United States. Mr. Brons said in an interview yesterday that the base of the Power Authority's system was dams built many years ago on the Niagara River, and that with the current environmental climate, ""I wonder if that could be built today."" Speaking of the Canadian project, he said, ""I'm not advocating willy-nilly go ahead, but the benefits to mankind that flow from that have to be kept in proper perspective."" But the view is likely to lead to conflict for the authority. Charles Komanoff, an energy expert in New York City, said the Authority's challenge ""ought to be to fulfill its contracts in New York State without having to participate in James Bay 2."" The authority should be promoting increased energy efficiency among its customers and around the state, he said, to maximize the benefit from ""the relatively cheap, relatively benign power"" that it produces from existing hydro sources.

With the last operating reactor scheduled to be idled as soon as next month, Japan — once one of the world’s leaders in atomic energy — will have at least temporarily shut down an industry that once generated a third of its electricity. With few alternatives, the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, has called for restarting the plants as soon as possible, saying he supports a gradual phase-out of nuclear power over several decades. Yet, fearing public opposition, he has said he will not restart the reactors without the approval of local community leaders. Japan has so far succeeded in avoiding shortages, thanks in part to a drastic conservation program that has involved turning off air-conditioning in the summer and office lights during the day. It has also increased generation from conventional plants that use more expensive natural gas and other fossil fuels in a nation already uneasy about its reliance on foreign sources of energy. The loss of nuclear power has hurt in another way: economists blame the higher energy prices for causing Japan’s first annual trade deficit in more than three decades, which has weakened the yen and raised concerns about the future of the country’s export-driven economy. And as the weather warms, Japan faces a possible energy crisis, considering that last summer it still had 19 nuclear plants in operation. On a more fundamental level, the standoff over nuclear power underscores just how much the trauma of the Fukushima accident has changed attitudes in Japan, long one of the world’s most committed promoters of civilian atomic energy. Political and energy experts describe nothing short of a nationwide loss of faith, not only in Japan’s once-vaunted nuclear technology but also in the government, which many blame for allowing the accident to happen. “March 11 has shaken Japan to the root of its postwar identity,” said Takeo Kikkawa, an economist who specializes in energy issues at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo. “We were the country that suffered Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but then we showed we had the superior technology and technocratic expertise to safely tame this awesome power for peaceful economic progress. Nuclear accidents were things that happened in other countries.” Hoping to allay the safety concerns of local communities, the government has asked plant operators to conduct so-called stress tests: computer simulations designed to show how the reactors would hold up during a large natural disaster like the magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami that disabled the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, where three reactors melted down after the cooling systems shut down. But many local leaders say the stress tests are not enough, and want additional proof that the government has learned the lessons of the Fukushima accident. The contest over the future of atomic energy in Japan is unfolding in this fishing town of 8,800 residents, 550 miles southwest of the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi plant and areas contaminated by its fallout. Two of the reactors at the Ohi Nuclear Power Plant were the first to finish the stress tests, making it a crucial test case of whether Japan’s nuclear plants can be restarted. The sprawling plant here was not damaged by the earthquake or tsunami but sits idled anyway because of a standoff caused by a legal quirk: Japanese law requires reactors to be shut down every 13 months for routine checkups, which typically take three or four months. But over the last year the plant’s operator, Kansai Electric Power, has been forced to shut down all four of the plant’s reactors, unable to restart them because of opposition from local residents. “After seeing what happened in Okuma, Futaba and Iitate, we cannot just turn these things back on,” said Shinobu Tokioka, the mayor of Ohi, naming evacuated communities near the Fukushima plant. He said he thought the reactors would eventually be turned back on because his and other host communities need the plant-related jobs and other revenues. In many respects, Japan is already on the road to recovery from the huge earthquake and tsunami, which killed as many as 19,000 people, and to a lesser degree from the nuclear accident. The northeastern coastal towns that were flattened by the waves have cleaned up millions of tons of debris and are beginning to rebuild. But it is the nuclear accident at Fukushima Daiichi that looks likely to have a more lasting impact, even though it has yet to claim a single life. Japan is just beginning what promises to be a radiation cleanup that will last decades of the evacuated areas around the plant, where nearly 90,000 residents lost their homes. The nation is also groping to find effective ways to monitor health and protect its food supply from contamination by the accident, which government scientists now say released about a fifth as much radioactive cesium as the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. Then there are the new feelings of distrust in technology and in the government, which many Japanese now blame for hiding the true dangers of the nuclear accident. At the same time, this resource-poor nation also knows that it has few realistic alternatives to nuclear power, at least in the short term. This has left many Japanese torn about whether to continue using nuclear power. These conflicting feelings are apparent in host communities like Ohi, a once-impoverished town that has prospered from the jobs and the $450 million brought by the nuclear plant since the 1970s. After first installing indoor plumbing for most residents and improving roads, the town moved on to flashy public works projects, and now boasts a hot springs resort, a sports complex with an indoor pool and lighted baseball diamond, and an indoor children’s playground featuring a full-size mock sailing ship on a sea of rubber balls. It is a similar story at other communities along this stretch of coast in western Japan’s Fukui Prefecture, which is known as Nuclear Alley because it has three other plants in addition to the Ohi plant. “We had allowed ourselves to become addicted to nuclear money, until Fukushima broke the spell,” said Tetsuen Nakajima, 70, the abbot of Myotsuji, a 1,200-year-old Buddhist temple in Obama, a city next to Ohi. He said he now feared for the ancient temple’s safety from the nearby plants. So far, the stress tests appear to have done little to ease public concerns, in part because they were begun before investigators had even reached conclusions about what actually caused the meltdowns at Fukushima. Last month, nuclear regulators responded with a list of 30 “lessons” from last year’s accident. In an interview, Ohi’s mayor, Mr. Tokioka, said the list was not enough, and repeated his demand for new guidelines even though writing them might take months. “The national government has to show us that it has learned from the mistakes at Fukushima Daiichi,” said Mr. Tokioka, 74. At the same time, Mr. Tokioka said he thought the reactors would eventually have to be turned back on, especially if the shutdown begins to hurt the local economy or disrupts electrical supplies. Other residents expressed similarly conflicted feelings. “No one wants to go back to living the same way we did 50 years ago, without cellphones or TVs,” said Mitsuyoshi Kunai, a 54-year-old fisherman who tended his nets just a few miles from the Ohi plant. “Fukushima showed us that nuclear power is dangerous, but we still need it.”",2012-03-08T19:09:19.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The decision to restart the Ohi nuclear plant ends the temporary freeze of Japan’s nuclear power industry, when all 50 of the country’s functional reactors were idled after the triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Despite the prime minister’s vows to strengthen the Ohi plant against the same sort of huge earthquake and tsunami that knocked out the Fukushima plant in March 2011, the Japanese people have remained deeply divided on the safety of nuclear power. Even after the prime minister made a rare appeal on June 8 on national television, opinion polls showed that more Japanese opposed restarting the Ohi plant than supported it. Mr. Noda urged the nation to return to nuclear power to avoid electricity shortages that could cause blackouts and cripple industry at a time of rising competition with China and the rest of Asia. Instead, he has supported a slow phasing out of nuclear plants over several decades, as energy alternatives are found. Saturday’s decision was seen here as a victory for the still-powerful nuclear industry and its backers in the business world, whose political support has been crucial to the otherwise unpopular Mr. Noda. It remains to be seen how the broader public will react to the restart order. Many Japanese already believe that Mr. Noda has rushed to proclaim the Ohi plant safe despite the fact that a new earthquake-resistant control center and other safety measures at the plant are years from completion. According to polls, two-thirds of Japanese express deep concern about the safety of nuclear plants after last year’s accident, which contaminated food with radiation and shattered the myth of Japan’s infallible nuclear technology. The day before Mr. Noda gave the order, his government was visited by an antinuclear group led by the Nobel laureate Kenzaburo Oe , which presented what it said were the signatures of 7.5 million people calling for the abolition of nuclear power . On Saturday, thousands of protesters turned out in the rain in Tokyo and elsewhere with placards criticizing the prime minister’s assertion that the Ohi plant was safe. Despite that, Mr. Noda ordered the restart of two of the four reactors at the plant, which provides electricity to Kansai, which includes the cities of Osaka and Kyoto and is Japan’s second-largest urban area. The plant’s operator, Kansai Electric Power, had forecast that without the plant, demand for electricity would exceed supply by about 15 percent during the summer. The operator said it would take time to restart the two reactors, which will not reach full operation until late July. The prime minister has said he wants the Ohi plant to be a first step toward resuming operations elsewhere. But he has been vague about when the next plant might be turned back on, apparently to gauge whether the public accepts the Ohi restart. To allay some of its safety concerns, the Noda government has been pushing a bill, expected to pass within days, to create a more independent nuclear regulatory agency. Independent investigations into the causes of the Fukushima accident have blamed lax oversight by the current regulatory body, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. Investigators said it had a conflict of interest because it was part of the Trade Ministry, which is charged with promoting nuclear power. In the weeks leading up to the restart decision, Mr. Noda had worked to gain the support of the mayor of Ohi, the plant’s host community, and the governor of Fukui Prefecture, where Ohi is located. Mr. Noda gave the restart order about 15 minutes after a meeting at his residence in which the governor, Issei Nishikawa, announced his acceptance of the restart. Ohi’s mayor, Shinobu Tokioka, had given his consent earlier in the week. However, many Japanese have criticized the prime minister as focusing on just two leaders who benefited for years from generous subsidies and tax benefits from the plant. Other local leaders have been highly skeptical of the Ohi plant’s safety, including the popular mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto, who said the reactors should be turned off again after the peak summer months.",2012-06-16T14:02:44.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

But as the plan takes shape at the state’s Public Service Commission, talk of still-young technologies has been overshadowed by something of a throwback: the state’s aging nuclear power plants. The commission is considering a proposal that makes the state’s three upstate nuclear plants important parts of its efforts to wean itself off fossil fuels, offering nearly $1 billion in ratepayer-financed subsidies over the next two years to save plants battered by rising costs and competition from cheap natural gas. The subsidy is likely to grow into the multibillion-dollar range over the 12-year period proposed by the state, a sum that has caused watchdogs to question whether the state is about to approve a major industry bailout with minimal public scrutiny — even though it is the public’s utility bills that will grow. Approval of the subsidies would make New York one of the first states to reward nuclear plants for what advocates of curtailing greenhouse gas emissions consider their chief advantage : They produce zero emissions. Though the commission outlined the plan in January, saying that the subsidy could cost anywhere from $59 million to $658 million by 2023, not until 10 days before the deadline for public comments did it disclose that the actual amount would be closer to $1 billion over the first two years. (The commission pushed the deadline back another week, to Friday, after a minor outcry, while maintaining that it had offered plenty of time and information.) From the state’s perspective, the subsidies are not simply handouts, but a way of putting a dollar value on the benefits of a reliable carbon-free power source. Propping them up for now, supporters say, will give the state time to foster a stable mix of renewable energy sources. The plants accounted for about a third of the power New York generated last year, as well as more than half of its emissions-free energy. Besides, supporters argue, the alternative is likely to be worse. Nuclear plants that have closed in other states and countries have been replaced with gas-powered generators, increasing greenhouse gas emissions. “We are moved by a growing scientific and environmental consensus that nuclear power must play a central role in fighting climate change,” wrote Environmental Progress, a pro-nuclear group of scientists and environmentalists, in a letter to the commission. “The closure of New York’s nuclear plants would undo all the progress the state has made towards its greenhouse targets.” For Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who directed the commission to draft the proposal, the plan adds to his environmental credentials through the state’s ambitious carbon-reduction goal. The nuclear subsidy will also help preserve what the state says are 2,600 well-paying jobs in upstate areas whose limp economies Mr. Cuomo is constantly at pains to revive. But it also excludes Indian Point , the nuclear plant north of New York City that the governor has repeatedly argued is too dangerous to continue operating. “Nuclear has a role,” Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said on Wednesday at an unrelated news conference, framing it as a matter of using the tools available. “Unless we’re willing to go back to candles, which would be uncomfortable and inconvenient, we need energy generation.” Exelon Corporation would stand to benefit the most from the plan; It owns two of the three upstate plants, and is in talks to buy the third, the FitzPatrick nuclear power plant in Oswego. Exelon has spent at least $426,000 on lobbying over the past two years, according to state records. “With very little process, and very little time for the public to even know this is happening, what they’re proposing here is a multibillion-dollar uncompetitive subsidy to one company,” said Jessica Azulay, a spokeswoman for the Alliance for a Green Economy, an environmentalist group. The alliance has calculated the total cost over 12 years as more than $7.6 billion. James Denn, a spokesman for the Public Service Commission, dismissed that estimate, saying that if wholesale energy prices rise, as they are forecast to do, customers will ultimately pay less in subsidies. If the nuclear plants closed, he added, energy prices would increase, forcing customers to pay more than three times what they would pay for subsidies. He also said the subsidies would return about $5 billion in benefits.",2016-07-21T05:01:06.000+02:00,NYTIMES,metro-new-york

Europe moved with startling speed to wean itself off Russian oil and natural gas in the wake of war in Ukraine. But breaking the longstanding dependency on Russia’s vast nuclear industry is a much more complicated undertaking. Russia, through its mammoth state-owned nuclear power company, Rosatom, dominates the global nuclear supply chain. It was Europe’s third-largest supplier of uranium in 2021, accounting for 20 percent of the total. With few ready alternatives, there has been scant support for sanctions against Rosatom — despite urging from the Ukrainian government in Kyiv. For countries with Russian-made reactors, reliance runs deep. In five European Union countries, every reactor — 18 in total — was built by Russia. In addition, two more are scheduled to start operating soon in Slovakia, and two are under construction in Hungary, cementing partnerships with Rosatom far into the future.",2023-03-10T17:42:35.000+01:00,NYTIMES,globalhome

Agency Says","Image Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in Kyiv on Thursday. Credit... Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Power has again been restored at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility, reducing worries about an accident at one of the war’s most sensitive sites. But the head of the United Nations’ atomic watchdog warned that Ukrainian workers were under yet more intense pressure as Moscow tries to assert further control of the plant. While Ukrainian engineers have continued to operate the plant under the watch of Russian soldiers, Moscow recently said it was nationalizing the facility. The effort is part of a broader bid to claim, in a parade of formalities designed to give the moves a sheen of legitimacy, that parts of Ukraine are now Russian. The nuclear plant sits in one of four Ukrainian provinces that President Vladimir V. Putin declared this month had been annexed to Russia — a move that has been widely rejected and condemned as illegal. Late Friday, Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in a statement that employees at the nuclear plant were now facing “unacceptable pressure” to sign employment contracts with the Russian nuclear energy company, Rosatom, in defiance of Kyiv. That pressure only adds to the stresses on the workers that Ukrainian officials have been warning about for months, saying that Russian soldiers had subjected already fatigued staff to harsh interrogations and torture. Holding the plant gives Moscow a military advantage but also significant leverage over Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Russian authorities could also, in theory, connect the facility to their grid, funneling power south to Ukrainian territory that Moscow has seized. Amid the continuing management struggle between Moscow and Kyiv, Ukraine’s nuclear power company said this week that Russia had kidnapped another senior official from the plant, expressing fears he could be forced to disclose information about Ukrainian personnel working there. The head of the plant had previously been detained and released. Ukraine’s state energy company, Energoatom, said on the Telegram messaging app on Saturday that it had set up a hotline for workers at the plant that could be used by “everyone who has information about cases of kidnapping and torture” by Russian authorities. Despite Russia’s claims to have nationalized the plant, the International Atomic Energy Agency says that it views the plant as Ukrainian, since the U.N. charter does not recognize illegal annexations. In a “much-needed development,” the Ukrainian engineers who have been working at the Zaporizhzhia site under intense Russian pressure have managed to restore backup power, ending the plant’s reliance on diesel generators. Most nuclear power plants consider diesel generators a last line of defense to be used only in extreme circumstances. It was the second time in recent days that shelling had cut power lines that feed the cooling systems for the plant’s six reactors, all of which are shut down. The war marks the first time that a nuclear facility has become an active battle zone. Russia has stationed troops and artillery at the plant since seizing it in March. Ukrainian authorities say the Russians have shelled nearby cities from the plant’s grounds, aware of the risk of returning fire. A waste storage site has been hit several times, and power lines have been a frequent target. Each side has blamed the other for the attacks. “Working in very challenging conditions, operating staff at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant are doing everything they can to bolster its fragile off-site power situation,” Mr. Grossi said. “Restoring the backup power connection is a positive step in this regard, even though the overall nuclear safety and security situation remains precarious.” The Zaporizhzhia plant is not providing electricity to Ukraine’s grid, given that its reactors are shut down. But it needs its own power source for safety reasons. Workers have been wrestling for weeks with how to provide that. Mr. Grossi said that efforts to restart one of the reactors for that purpose would begin on Saturday in a process that would take several days. In addition, more diesel fuel has arrived, from both the Ukrainian and Russian side of the front line, to power Zaporizhzhia’s generators for at least 10 days should the plant again be cut off, he said.",2022-10-15T20:13:32.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Credit... David Guttenfelder for The New York Times KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian energy agency responsible for the oversight and safe operation of the nation’s nuclear power plants said on Tuesday night that Russian hackers had launched their most ambitious effort yet on the company’s official website. The attack appeared to fail and there was no indication that it threatened to disrupt the Ukrainian power grid or the company’s oversight of the nation’s 15 working nuclear reactors. The company, Energoatom, said it had managed to keep the attack from being visible to users of the website. Even so, it was a reminder of the digital threat posed to the power infrastructure in Ukraine, where the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has stirred global alarm. Ukraine’s power grid has been knocked offline twice before, in 2015 and 2016, causing widespread blackouts, and Russian efforts to attack the Energoatom site were being closely watched in case they presaged a larger event. The large-scale cyberattacks — like knocking out Ukraine’s power grid or frying cellular service — that Western intelligence officials worried would accompany the Russian invasion in February have failed to materialize. But Russia has used hacking campaigns to support its ground campaign, pairing malware with missiles in several attacks, including on TV stations and government agencies, according to a report released in April by Microsoft. Ukrainian officials said this spring that they had thwarted a cyberattack on Ukraine’s power grid that could have knocked out power to two million people, raising fears that Moscow was continuing to persist in its digital efforts to advance its military campaign. Daily shelling at the Zaporizhzhia complex — Europe’s largest nuclear power plant — has sparked international concerns about the possibility of a meltdown. The United Nations has offered to help send nuclear inspectors to the site, which is occupied by Russian forces but being operated by Ukrainian workers, if both sides agree. It remains unclear who is to blame for the shelling. The Ukrainians have accused the Russians of directing strikes there to cut off energy supplies to other cities, while the Russians say Ukraine is responsible for the attacks. On Tuesday, President Emmanuel Macron of France and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine spoke by telephone about safety threats at the Zaporizhzhia plant. According to a statement from Mr. Macron’s office, the French president stressed his concern about the “ongoing clashes on the safety and security of Ukrainian nuclear facilities” and called for the withdrawal of Russian forces.

President Bush's Thanksgiving Day invocation of an imminent Iraqi nuclear threat to justify war in the Persian Gulf misreads history. Expert estimates put Iraqi acquisition of a limited nuclear arsenal at least 10 years away. But even if Iraq were to soon to assemble the one crude atomic bomb that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney described last weekend, the experience of one nation after another across 45 years of postwar history has demonstrated that acquiring such weapons in a nuclear-armed world is inescapably self-deterring. Nations have sought to acquire nuclear weapons because an enemy has acquired them or because they feared that it would do so, and because they wished to command increased international respect. Both motives drove the U.S. effort during World War II and the Soviets' effort during the postwar years; both motives probably drive the Iraqi effort today. When a national leadership contemplates its shining new nuclear arsenal, however, it soon learns that it has made itself more vulnerable rather than less. The only nuclear weapons ever exploded in war were exploded against a non-nuclear opponent. Attacking a nuclear power or a nuclear power's client invites nuclear retaliation. However ambitious a nation's leadership, it must retreat before the prospect of destroying its own base of power; even a crude, low-yield, first-generation nuclear weapon can destroy a city, as the U.S. demonstrated at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945; a few such weapons can devastate a country. McGeorge Bundy, professor emeritus of history at New York University, emphasized the stark minimalism of nuclear deterrence as long ago as 1969. ""In the real world of real political leaders,"" he wrote in Foreign Affairs, ""a decision that would bring even one hydrogen bomb on one city of one's own country would be recognized in advance as a catastrophic blunder."" In Mr. Bundy's experience of government, as special assistant for national security affairs to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, one nuclear weapon, guaranteed deliverable, is sufficient deterrence. Such has been the common experience of the world throughout the nuclear age. A corollary unwelcome lesson that arriviste nuclear powers learn is that nuclear weapons are useless militarily, precisely because using them would trigger nuclear retaliation. Significantly, nations have pursued nuclear deterrence in defense against historic enemies. The U.S. and the Soviet Union armed against each other; China against all; India to deter China as well as Pakistan; Pakistan to deter India. The Iraqi effort follows that norm, paired in this case with Israel. Indeed, the one nation an Iraqi bomb might seriously discomfit is Israel, which is why Israel pre-emptively destroyed Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981. Not that Saddam Hussein or his successors would be likely to attack Israel with nuclear weapons if they had them. Such an attack would be self-evidently suicidal, given Israel's formidable nuclear arsenal, estimated to contain between 100 and 200 boosted fission weapons. Rather, an Iraqi nuclear capability would threaten Israel by deterring it from nuclear reprisal against conventional attack, the mainstay of its present strategy for survival in the volatile Middle East. At the same time, Iraq would continue to be deterred from attacking Israel. No doubt Israel would prefer to remain the only local nuclear power in the Middle East. More than four decades of hard experience taught the U.S. and the Soviet Union that conventional war under the shadow of nuclear deterrence leads inevitably to stalemate because neither side dares to push the other side far enough to provoke nuclear attack. In the short run, that stalemate encouraged the status quo -- the division of Europe, two Koreas, the balance of power in the Middle East. But arms races are expensive, times change, populations become restive, and eventually such pressures must drive the stalemated nations to the bargaining table, forcing them to resolve their disputes by negotiation rather than militarily. Decades ago, when the superpowers were first rushing to accumulate their dangerous nuclear arsenals, the Danish physicist and statesman Niels Bohr captured the fundamental paradox of the arms race in a memorable phrase. ""We are in a completely new situation,"" Dr. Bohr concluded, ""that cannot be resolved by war."" If Iraq acquired a nuclear arsenal, such would be the situation between Iraq and Israel. Is an Iraqi bomb, paradoxically, desirable? To the contrary: Given the continuing danger of nuclear destruction triggered by accident or subversion, the last thing the world needs is another nuclear power. There are less destabilizing alternatives, but they require an effort of statesmanship more creative than going to war against Iraq. Saddam Hussein pursues a nuclear capability in emulation of the nuclear powers already on the board, the U.S. and the Soviet Union pre-eminent among them, which have only recently begun in good faith to reduce their arsenals and redeem their pledges under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. So long as Iraq remains isolated from the world community and belligerent, delivery of nuclear weapons technology and materiel to that nation ought to be strictly embargoed by international authority just as delivery of conventional arms has been. Such an embargo would slow Iraq down, but only a true Middle East peace settlement is likely to provide Saddam Hussein and his successors with security guarantees sufficiently robust to convince them not to go nuclear as soon as they can manage to do so. Either way, the introduction of nuclear weapons into the Middle East, already an accomplished fact, means that the status quo there must inevitably give way to negotiated change.",1990-11-27T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,opinion

Regardless of their age, all nuclear energy facilities are required to be maintained in top condition. Since 1990, the nuclear energy industry has invested more than $90 billion in capital expenditures to improve and upgrade facilities. Those improvements have helped yield a 33 percent increase in nuclear-generated electricity production over that period. The Energy Information Administration forecasts that electricity demand will increase 28 percent by 2040, the equivalent of 339 new large power plants. Meeting that demand with low-carbon electricity sources requires recognition of nuclear energy’s many attributes.

THE DEMISE OF NUCLEAR ENERGY? Lessons for Democratic Control of Technology. By Joseph G. Morone and Edward J. Woodhouse. (Yale University, Cloth, $22.50; Paper, $6.95.) This sensible little book offers a penetrating and balanced assessment of a hefty subject: how a useful form of energy turned out to be unacceptable to the American public. The answer proposed by the authors of ''The Demise of Nuclear Energy?'' is that the commercial nuclear power program in the United States was flawed from the outset. Virtually every important decision about the design and regulation of nuclear reactors was made in private by small groups of engineers, businessmen and Government officials. Instead of developing safe reactors designed to be as economical as possible, the industry's early leaders developed economical reactors and then tried to build in safety. Lastly, the Government and the industry misled the public about the cost and the danger of nuclear power. Thus, support eroded swiftly after serious nuclear accidents near Detroit, in Alabama and at Three Mile Island convinced the public that the technology behaved in unexpected ways. Joseph G. Morone and Edward J. Woodhouse, who both teach at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, write that the short, expensive and mostly unhappy story of the United States commercial nuclear power industry could have been different if the industry's leaders had grasped the central requirement in a democracy for developing a technology as powerful and potentially hazardous as theirs was: share everything, the good and the bad, with the public. Had vital issues become public in the 1950's, the authors argue, important mistakes might not have been made. Mr. Morone and Mr. Woodhouse assert that lessons learned from the disappointing experience with nuclear power should not be lost on leaders of other technical industries of the late 20th century, among them biotechnology, chemical engineering and transportation.

The stunning pictures of Neptune being transmitted to Earth from the Voyager 2 spacecraft are coming courtesy of an unusual form of nuclear power that runs the craft's cameras, computers and radio transmitters that beam the pictures over. The Voyager's designers knew the craft would fly so far from the Sun that solar-electric cells would be virtually useless. To create electricity in the void, they instead relied on a small type of nuclear generator that turns the heat of decaying plutonium-238 into electric power. This energy source is not that of a nuclear reactor, in which atoms are actively broken apart, but rather a kind of nuclear battery that uses natural radioactive decay to produce power. Voyager 2 uses three of these radioisotope thermionic generators. In them, the heat from decaying plutonium, applied to metal strips, generates a flow of electrons. The device has with no moving parts, no flow of fluids and no turbines. The three units are now producing about 375 watts of electricity to power all the spacecraft's systems. This amount of current is far less than a kitchen toaster or a hair dryer require. Perfectly Working Units Weighing 83 pounds each, the individual units were developed by the Department of Energy, and the radioactive cores were built by the General Electric Company. The units have worked perfectly since Voyager was launched in 1977 and are expected to do so for many years to come as the craft moves beyond the solar system. Such nuclear devices have powered 22 American space missions, and are scheduled to do so in the future. In October, a space shuttle is to carry aloft the Galileo spacecraft on a mission to explore Jupiter. The Galileo will be powered by the devices. This type of energy source is controversial because of the slight risk of an accident, especially during the launching of a plutonium-powered spacecraft. Critics fear an explosion could spread plutonium, which can cause cancer. To limit health risks, the plutonium is surrounded by multiple layers of shielding, including thick graphite shells, ''designed to withstand the extreme of impact and temperatures associated with a mission abort,'' the National Aeronautics and Space Administration says. Steven Aftergood, director of the Committee to Bridge the Gap, a Los Angeles group that monitors nuclear space technologies, said he believes the plutonium power source should be used ''only when there are no alternatives.'' But ''on the plus side,'' he said, ''the mission and its discoveries could not have been done'' without the power pack.",1989-08-26T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

When the entirety of the life cycle of a nuclear plant -- inclusive of uranium mining and production, plant construction and the like -- are viewed, when the environmental impact of daily radioactive releases from plants and the environmental effects of thousands of radioactive spent fuel rods are viewed, the green claim evaporates. In fact, renewable energy sources coupled with energy efficiencies -- attainable goals, just witness California and Europe -- are much more cost-effective and attainable in combating global warming than nuclear plants and much less dangerous. Even modest investments in efficiencies and renewables would reduce global warming pollutants by 47 percent by 2025. And each dollar invested in energy efficiency displaces seven times as much carbon dioxide as a dollar invested in nuclear power. Glenn Rickles Croton-on-Hudson The writer is on the steering committee of the Indian Point Safe Energy Coalition. To the Editor: In ''Play It Safe at Indian Point,'' you asked why Entergy wouldn't welcome an independent assessment of the Indian Point nuclear power plant if such a review would satisfy the scrutiny of nuclear critics. But these critics can't be satisfied. For example, in June 2006 an assessment on the feasibility of replacing the power produced by Indian Point, the result of a two-year study by the National Academy of Sciences commissioned by Representative Nita M. Lowey, found that closing the plant would not be easily accomplished, nor was it advisable. Yet these critics continue to claim that Indian Point can be closed with no adverse consequences to the energy production or economy of the region. Laurent L.

Nuclear plants have long generated nearly a quarter of Germany’s electricity. But after the tsunami and earthquake that sent radiation spewing from Fukushima, half a world away, the government disconnected the 8 oldest of Germany’s 17 reactors — including the two in this drab factory town — within days. Three months later, with a new plan to power the country without nuclear energy and a growing reliance on renewable energy, Parliament voted to close them permanently. There are plans to retire the remaining nine reactors by 2022. As a result, electricity producers are scrambling to ensure an adequate supply. Customers and companies are nervous about whether their lights and assembly lines will stay up and running this winter. Economists and politicians argue over how much prices will rise. “It’s easy to say, ‘Let’s just go for renewables,’ and I’m quite sure we can someday do without nuclear, but this is too abrupt,” said Joachim Knebel, chief scientist at Germany’s prestigious Karlsruhe Institute of Technology . He characterized the government’s shutdown decision as “emotional” and pointed out that on most days, Germany has survived this experiment only by importing electricity from neighboring France and the Czech Republic, which generate much of their power with nuclear reactors. Then there are real concerns that the plan will jettison efforts to rein in manmade global warming, since whatever nuclear energy’s shortcomings, it is low in emissions. If Germany, the world’s fourth-largest economy, falls back on dirty coal-burning plants or uncertain supplies of natural gas from Russia, isn’t it trading a potential risk for a real one? The world is watching Germany’s extreme energy makeover, as politicians from New York to Rome have floated their own plans to shut or shelve reactors. The International Energy Agency, generally a fan of Germany’s green-leaning energy policy, has been critical. Laszlo Varro, head of the agency’s gas, coal and power markets division, called the plan “very, very ambitious, though it is not impossible, since Germany is rich and technically sophisticated.” Even if Germany succeeds in producing the electricity it needs, “the nuclear moratorium is very bad news in terms of climate policy,” Mr. Varro said. “We are not far from losing that battle, and losing nuclear makes that unnecessarily difficult.” The government counters that it is prepared to make huge investments in improving energy efficiency in homes and factories as well as in new clean power sources and transmission lines. So far, there have been no blackouts. But Jürgen Grossmann, chief executive of the German energy giant RWE, which owns two closed reactors here in Biblis, about 40 miles south of Frankfurt, expressed skepticism. “Germany, in a very rash decision, decided to experiment on ourselves,” he said. “The politics are overruling the technical arguments.” The Nuclear Equation Germany’s planners believed they could forgo nuclear energy in large part because of the country’s remarkable progress in renewable energy, which now accounts for 17 percent of its electricity output, a number the government estimates will double in 10 years. On days when the offshore wind turbines spin full tilt, Germany produces more electricity from renewable sources than it uses, according to European energy monitors. Germany has “exceeded everyone’s expectations on renewable power,” said Mr. Varro, showing that it could be cost effective and reliable. Until it closed the reactors, Germany was Europe’s leading energy exporter. With a total of 133 gigawatts of installed generating capacity in place at the start of this year, “there was really a huge amount of space to shut off nuclear plants,” Harry Lehmann, a director general of the German Federal Environment Agency and one of Germany’s leading policy makers on energy and environment, said of the road map he helped develop. The country needs about 90.5 gigawatts of generating capacity on hand to fill a typical national demand of about 80 gigawatts. So the 25 gigawatts that nuclear power contributed would not be missed — at least within its borders. To be prudent, the plan calls for the creation of 23 gigawatts of gas- and coal-powered plants by 2020. Why? Because renewable plants don’t produce nearly to capacity if the air is calm or the sky is cloudy, and there is currently limited capacity to store or transport electricity, energy experts say. New coal and gas plants will use the cleanest technology available and should not aggravate climate change, government officials said, because they will operate within the European carbon-trading system in which plants that exceed the allowed emissions cap have to buy carbon credits from companies whose activities are environmentally beneficial, thus evening out the environmental ledger. Electricity prices are expected to rise by 35 to 40 euros ($50 to $60) per household each year, or less than 5 percent, the government estimates. Though nuclear energy generally costs less than newer options, German law has long stipulated that renewable energy must be purchased first even if it is costlier. But skeptics consider government assumptions overly optimistic. Stefan Martus, the mayor of Philippsburg, says he believes energy costs could rise more dramatically than government estimates; the price of permits to offset dirty power plants is highly unpredictable and variable, like the value of stocks. And the International Energy Agency does not think Germany — or any other country — will be able to reduce its emissions at a reasonable cost without nuclear power. Energy agency officials also question predictions that electricity use will decline an additional 10 percent over the next decade given the projected expansion of electric growth of the German economy. The average German family already uses only about half the electricity of its American equivalent. “Yes, there is German angst about nuclear power,” said Hildegard Cornelius-Gaus, the mayor of Biblis. ”But if you phrased the question, ‘Would you want to phase out nuclear energy if it cost massively more and you risk blackouts?’ the answer would be very different.” An Ambivalent History Even before Fukushima, nuclear energy’s days in Germany were numbered. Biblis had been the site of giant national antinuclear demonstrations, and Germany was already enacting a plan for slowly phasing out nuclear energy by 2023. The country had become the world leader in wind power and a master at squeezing more energy efficiency out of appliances and homes, having built tens of thousands of self-heating “passive houses.” Still, Chancellor Angela Merkel, herself a physicist, decided last fall to extend the operating licenses of Germany’s nuclear plants over concerns that innovation alone would not satisfy the country’s energy appetite. Fukushima changed everything. That Japan is a technologically advanced country made the nuclear accident more alarming to the German people than the Chernobyl disaster, at an old Soviet reactor. Despite that, industry experts and residents of reactor towns like Biblis and nearby Philippsburg were stunned by the suddenness of the about-face. Both towns will lose hundreds of jobs and millions in tax revenue. German energy companies say they have been handed a national energy template that looks good on paper but is technically challenging. Although the country’s production of energy is bounteous, they say it is not always available where and when it is needed. Northern Germany has offshore wind and coal deposits, but southern Germany — a manufacturing epicenter that is home to Mercedes, BMW and Audi — has no plentiful local fuel source other than nuclear. Germany’s current grid is highly decentralized, lacking high-voltage transmission lines to move electricity over long distances. “Now, with the nuclear shut down, we have a very difficult task,” said Joachim Vanzetta, head of transmission system operations at Amprion, the largest of the country’s four grid operators. Amprion had already started working toward a renewable future with no nuclear power, planning for 500 miles of new transmission lines to bring electricity from north to south that would cost $4.3 billion and take 10 to 15 years to build. At most, 40 miles of lines have been completed. The country has also been pouring money into biomass plants and solar installations — millions of panels now sit on German roofs and fields. Despite recent technological improvements, solar electricity is still far more expensive to generate than wind, gas or nuclear power. And output can be highly seasonal. Germany’s hope that gas and coal plants will temporarily replace some of the lost nuclear generation may be hard to fulfill — power companies remain lukewarm about building them especially given the German policy of buying “clean” energy first. “Few operators will be willing to build a power plant in a form that may ultimately only run a couple of hundred hours a year,” Mr. Grossman of RWE said. This winter, Amprion predicts its grid will have 84,000 megawatts of electricity at its disposal, to provide 81,000 megawatts needed for consumption — an uncomfortably slim margin of safety, Mr. Vanzetta said. In prior years, electricity was readily available for purchase on the European grid if the price was right. But exported German power is what helped keep France glowing in winter. “At the moment, we have a stressed system, but it’s under control,” Mr. Vanzetta said. “If we have days with no wind and no solar and can’t buy energy from abroad, then there is the risk of blackouts.”",2011-08-30T07:54:55.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-science-environment

The Israeli infrastructure minister, Uzi Landau, said at a Paris conference that Israel wanted a cleaner, more reliable source of energy than the large amounts of coal now imported. He said that regional cooperation on civilian nuclear power could help bind the Middle East. Jordan, however, said any such cooperation was premature before a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Jordan, like Egypt, has been talking about building a civilian nuclear power plant for some time. Iran, already subject to sanctions by the United Nations Security Council, insists that its nuclear program is purely for civilian purposes, but Western governments believe its intentions are military. Still, Israel’s announcement here may further complicate efforts to get the Security Council to impose new sanctions on Iran. Syria, at the same Paris conference, sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , said that it was also considering building a nuclear power plant; Israel bombed what is believed to have been a secret Syrian nuclear reactor in September 2007. The reactor, built with North Korean help, was said to be designed for the production of plutonium. Syria insists that Israel bombed an unused military facility . Syria is a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has expressed disappointment with Syria’s refusal to answer outstanding questions about the supposed nuclear reactor. Syria’s deputy foreign minister, Faysal Mekdad, said at the conference that Syria also wanted alternative energy sources. “The peaceful application of nuclear energy should not be monopolized by the few that own this technology, but should be available equally for all,” he said. Israel has never admitted that it has nuclear weapons, and it has refused to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Israel is a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and Mr. Landau said that any nuclear power plant would be subject to international safeguards. Israel has chosen a location in the northern Negev desert. “In a region like the Middle East, we can only depend on ourselves,” Mr. Landau said. “Building a nuclear reactor to produce electricity will allow Israel to develop energy independence.” Israel’s nuclear reactor at Dimona was built with French help in the 1950s and was said to be used for weapons production. When a former worker there, Mordechai Vanunu , leaked the story to the Sunday Times of London in 1986, he was hunted down and arrested, spending 18 years in jail. Israel has another, smaller, research reactor at Nahal Soreq, near Tel Aviv. France is a major vendor of civilian nuclear technology. Under President Nicolas Sarkozy, France has maintained close ties to Israel while it has reached out to Damascus, as well, trying to bring Syria in from diplomatic isolation and restart peace talks with Israel.",2010-03-09T20:48:37.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-middle-east

He said that emergency systems had worked during the time that the power plant was severed from the electricity grid, but that, had they failed, the country, and the world, would be contending with a nuclear accident. “Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster,” Mr. Zelensky said.",2022-08-26T01:25:19.000+02:00,NYTIMES,europe

IN April 1946, in a proposal to the newly formed United Nations, the United States took the first formal steps to establish a doctrine of clear division between civilian and military uses of nuclear technology. That was the cornerstone of Washington's political effort to control the spread of nuclear weapons while promulgating the development of nuclear power. IN April 1946, in a proposal to the newly formed United Nations, the United States took the first formal steps to establish a doctrine of clear division between civilian and military uses of nuclear technology. That was the cornerstone of Washington's political effort to control the spread of nuclear weapons while promulgating the development of nuclear power. Now critics of the Reagan Administration are arguing that the United States has taken a provocative step toward breaching that doctrine. Under an executive order issued by President Reagan Nov. 18, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission must draw up detailed plans for dealing with a national security emergency, including a plan to seize civilian nuclear power plants to obtain material for weapons. Plutonium, for instance, is present in the reactors' spent fuel rods. If reactors were seized for military use, ''it would weaken our hand with the rest of the world in dealing with the proliferation of nuclear weapons,'' said Dr. George W. Rathjens, a chemist and political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Spokesmen for the White House and the Department of Energy denied that the executive order was a change in doctrine, or that it was related in any way to the grave problems in the nuclear weapons industry. Pervasive mismanagement, accidents, pollution and sloppy procedures have led to the closing of factories and a halt in the production of materials for nuclear weapons, particularly tritium, a radioactive gas used in warheads. Even if the Energy Department is able to solve the immediate problems and restart three tritium production reactors at the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, public opposition and the Federal budget deficit threaten a multibillion-dollar plan to build new reactors and modernize old plants. The Government spokesmen said that formulation of the order began in 1982, before the scope of the troubles at the nuclear weapons plants was recognized. They insisted that the directive only updated a 1969 executive order detailing the responsibilities of Federal agencies in the event of a nuclear attack. Arms control experts and critics of the Administration's nuclear policies said the directive made them suspicious. They said the inability to produce tritium could be considered a national security emergency, since a steady supply of it is needed to maintain the arsenal in operational readiness. The order defines such an emergency as ''any occurrence, including natural disaster, military attack, technological emergency, or other emergency, that threatens the national security.'' Earlier Plans Faulted These experts said the Reagan Administration had previously attempted to blur the distinction between civilian and military uses for nuclear technology. In 1981, they noted, Dr. James B. Edwards, Mr. Reagan's first Energy Secretary, proposed saving money by using spent fuel from civilian reactors as a source of plutonium for weapons. Congress prohibited that in a 1982 law. In 1986, the Energy Department proposed taking over an unfinished civilian nuclear power plant in Washington State to produce material for atomic weapons. That proposal is still being studied. And last week the Energy Department said it was spending $4 million a year to study conversion of light-water reactors, the type used in all civilian nuclear power plants but one, to produce tritium. Experts with two companies that build reactors, Babcock & Wilcox Company and Westinghouse Electric Corporation, said in interviews that civilian reactors could be turned into tritium producers ''in a matter of months'' by changing fuel rods and altering reactor cores. Energy Department officials privately acknowledge that the concept is attractive. The agency has proposed spending at least $9 billion to build new tritium-producing reactors, plants that would not be completed until after the turn of the century. A Quicker Solution Converting civilian reactors, including dormant reactors owned by the Tennessee Valley Authority, a Federal agency, could be done more quickly and at much lower cost. The prospect alarms Government critics who fear it would send the wrong signal to other nations with civilian reactor complexes but with no nuclear weapons. Since the United States made its international appeal for nuclear arms control in 1946, its leaders have consistently affirmed the doctrine of a clear delineation between civilian and military uses of nuclear technology. In 1953, in a speech to the United Nations, President Eisenhower proposed the Atoms for Peace Program, promoting nonmilitary uses of atomic technology. In 1968 under President Johnson, the United States signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which included strongly worded provisions against the use of civilian nuclear industries for military purposes. The order issued Friday calls for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop a plan to suspend the licenses of civilian reactors and enable Federal agents to operate them to gain ''special nuclear materials'' for use in nuclear weapons in the event of a national security emergency. Previous orders basically said that if United States survival was at stake, as in a nuclear attack, emergency measures would have to be taken. ''What you have here is a wholly new concept,'' said Paul Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, an arms control policy group in Washington. ''For economy reasons the Government may be saying it would be more convenient to use nuclear power plants for weapon materials instead of building new ones or fixing up the old ones.''",1988-11-27T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,week-in-review

There are more than 30 reactors of similar design around the country, and the officials, at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said last week that they had warned these plants of the problem. It is the first time such a crack has been discovered in this kind of reactor, the officials said. Separately, the Office of Technology Assessment, a Congressional agency, issued a report last week on aging nuclear power plants saying that ""long-term prospects for the nation's 107 operating nuclear power plants are increasingly unclear."" Early Plant Retirements Although plants are licensed for 40 years, no one really knows what a reactor's life expectancy is. Six plants have been retired since 1989, all well before their operating licenses had expired, the study said, and the owners of several others are considering early closings. But the study said the recent history ""may give a misleadingly dim view of the remaining lives of other nuclear power plants because of the great diversity among plants and changing electricity market conditions."" In the case of the North Carolina reactor, Brunswick 1, which is 17 years old, Federal officials have ordered the utility, the Carolina Power and Light Company, to keep the plant shut until it can repair the cylinder or prove that it cannot cause a major accident. The plant, in Southport, has been shut since April 1992 for refueling and improvements. The crack runs more than halfway through the 3-inch-thick wall of the cylinder, or core shroud, which surrounds the nuclear core and is inside the reactor vessel, the giant steel pot in which water is boiled into steam for power. The crack is apparently a result of years of radiation, repeated heating and cooling, unfavorable water chemistry in the reactor and stresses in the metal, said Stewart D. Ebneter, the regional administrator of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Atlanta. ""It's a very complex mechanism,"" he said. The utility found the crack after General Electric, which designed the plant, warned owners of similar plants that a crack had been found in a core shroud in Switzerland. But the crack in the Swiss plant was in a different part of the shroud, Mr. Ebneter said. Inspection Finds More Cracks Mr. Ebneter said that technicians examining the Brunswick shroud with ultrasonic gear found other cracks, ""but they are not as big or as deep, so far as we can tell."" The inspection is complicated by the fact that the shroud is kept under water to hold down radiation levels. In the worst case, Mr. Ebneter said, the shroud could shift, bending parts inside the core, which might prevent operators from inserting control rods between the fuel rods. Control rods choke off the flow of neutrons and thus end the chain reaction, shutting down the reactor. If the reaction cannot be stopped, the plant could experience a runaway reaction. If engineers decide that the shroud must be repaired, divers could bolt braces into place, he said, although the job would be difficult. At the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nuclear watchdog group, Robert Pollard, an engineer who was once an inspector for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said such cracks were ""one of the longstanding concerns about embrittlement of reactor internals.""",1993-10-07T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

But in many ways, it is a move that reaches even further back — beyond the deregulatory and privatization policies of Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, to an earlier time when Britain and many other Western countries did not assume that their national energy needs would be served by market forces. In reaching its nuclear deal with EDF Group, the big French state-controlled utility, and opening the door to financing from China, the British government signaled that whether in terms of environmental concerns, consumer prices or Britain’s long-term energy independence, the free market alone no longer served the national interest. “This government is facing a looming energy crisis in this decade thanks to years of neglect and underinvestment,” Edward Davey, the British secretary of energy and climate change, said at a news conference in London. Britain has been gripped by growing worries about its future power supplies, with supply falling and prices rising. Electric utilities have been reluctant to invest in new gas-fired plants to replace dirtier coal-burning ones because of many uncertainties — including a new energy bill winding its way through Parliament and the growth of subsidized wind and solar energy projects. Mr. Davey said that Britain would need to replace about 60 percent of its generating capacity “in a relatively short time,” as Britain closes coal-fired plants to meet its climate-change objectives of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2025. The country will also gradually close its mostly aging collection of nuclear plants, which now produce 19 percent of Britain’s power. Only one of the plants, Sizewell B, which was finished in 1995, has modern technology. The twin reactors envisioned in Monday’s announcement are to be built at Hinkley Point, in southwest England, which is currently the locale of two 1970s-era reactors . They would advance the government’s goal of adding more low-carbon sources of energy, but the project will come with a huge price tag. It is the kind of long-term project, with an even longer horizon for paying for itself, that private investors alone would be unlikely to undertake. The overall costs of building the plants is estimated at £16 billion, or $26 billion, in 2012 terms. To reduce the investment risk, Britain and EDF are bringing in two state-backed Chinese companies, the China General Nuclear Corporation and the China National Nuclear Corporation. EDF also says it is talking to other investors that may take as much as a 15 percent stake. The Chinese companies will take a stake of 30 to 40 percent in Hinkley Point. According to EDF, which is working with the two Chinese companies on nuclear power stations in China, the companies will be “strategic and industrial partners” in the project and will be given the “opportunity to gain experience in the U.K. and will support their long-term objective of becoming leading developers in the U.K.” But at the news conference, Henri Proglio, EDF’s chief executive, played down the Chinese role, saying that EDF was in charge along with the French reactor designer Areva, and that British companies would be assigned more important roles. That EDF alone cannot finance the plant “highlights the complexities of modern nuclear power projects,” said Antony Froggatt, an industry analyst at Chatham House, a research institute in London. He said that it would be “better to invest in other” alternative sources of energy like wind and solar power. Consumers will also wait a long time to receive electricity from the new nuclear plants, which EDF says will provide power equivalent to 7 percent of British consumption and enough to power almost six million homes. If EDF makes its final investment decision in summer 2014, the first of the two Hinkley Point reactors will not begin producing power until 2023. British consumers and taxpayers will pay much of the bill. EDF will be guaranteed a price per megawatt hour of £89.50 to £92.50 — about $144.50 to $149.40 — for 35 years. Those prices, to be fully indexed to inflation, would be almost double current wholesale power prices. Analysts say the terms may wind up being generous for EDF, which says it will make a return of about 10 percent from the project. Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy, the company’s British arm, said that any cost savings would be shared between investors and consumers. The British government may have had little choice if it wanted to sign a deal at this time. Other potential suppliers like Hitachi of Japan are considered years behind EDF in their technology. Nuclear power has attractions. Unlike renewables like solar and wind it produces steady, reliable power for decades. But the upfront costs are huge and there is no payoff for a decade or more. It is difficult to persuade a provider to build a nuclear plant without some guarantee, particularly now, when the emergence of shale gas in the United States and the growth of renewable energy in Europe are creating uncertainty about power prices. And while Hinkley Point will not begin providing power for 10 years, the high costs of the plant will inevitably stoke the debate about rising energy bills in Britain. Even as the deal was being struck, millions of Britons were learning of increases in energy charges, including more than three million customers of NPower, a utility that announced on Monday that it would increase electricity prices by 9.3 percent and gas prices by 11 percent. “This is a terrible deal for billpayers,” said Caroline Lucas, a member of Parliament for the Greens, who called for an investigation by the National Audit Office, a spending watchdog. “At a time when the costs of renewable energy are falling, it’s reckless for the government to subsidize the nuclear industry in this way.”",2013-10-21T10:28:31.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-international-business

Credit... Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times KYIV, Ukraine — Shelling once again threatened the safe operation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, even as United Nations officials expressed cautious optimism that a permanent presence of its inspectors at the plant was helping to lower the risk of a nuclear disaster. The plant lost the connection with its last remaining main external power line after shelling on Friday evening, forcing engineers to rely on a lower-voltage reserve line to power the cooling equipment needed to prevent meltdowns, the International Atomic Energy Agency said in statement. Nuclear power plants must sometimes rely on external power drawn from the grid to cool the reactor cores and spent fuel. If the external power lines are cut, the Zaporizhzhia plant must turn to backup diesel generators, and if those malfunction or run out of fuel, a meltdown becomes possible. After visiting the plant, Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director of the agency told a news conference on Friday that his biggest concern regarding the physical safety of the facility itself was related to a reliable connection to external power. That connection has been severed at least twice in recent weeks. When the main power lines and the reserve line were damaged by shelling and fires on Aug. 25, there was a blackout at the plant, and diesel generators had to be relied on to prevent a disaster. The I.A.E.A. said it was informed by Ukraine that it had happened again on Friday night after renewed shelling in the area. Fighting has raged across southern and eastern Ukraine, and the plant lies precariously close to the front lines of some of the most intense fighting. Mr. Grossi, who has avoided placing blame for the shelling on either the Russians or the Ukrainians, said Friday that it appeared the power supply to the plant was being deliberately targeted. “It is clear that those who have these military aims, know very well that the way to cripple or to do more damage is not to look into the reactors which are enormously sturdy and robust,” he said. Instead, it is being hit where it hurts — the critical power lines essential for running the plant. Without external power, the cooling system of the plant can cease functioning, nuclear experts say. Power is needed to pump water past the nuclear core and carry heat away. While the chain reaction in the core can be shut off quickly, the radioactive material there will continue to give off heat for a long time and can eventually damage the radioactive fuel or the reactor. On Saturday, Mr. Grossi said that the presence of the agency’s inspectors, who were able to confirm the damage to the external power line, was already proving valuable. He called it a “game changer.” “Our team on the ground received direct, fast and reliable information about the latest significant development affecting the plant’s external power situation, as well as the operational status of the reactors,” he said.

According to Nuclear Regulatory Commission studies, even the most severe accident associated with decommissioning would lead to exceptionally small releases of radioactivity. The radiation exposure would be no greater than that resulting from an individual moving from Dallas to Denver, because the altitude makes the natural level of radiation in Denver higher. (At higher altitudes the atmosphere is thinner, shielding less of the natural radiation from space.) While the cost of decommissioning is large in dollars, it is actually a very small fraction, less than 1 percent, of the value of the power produced. Putting the issue into perspective, the cost of dismantling all existing plants would be only 2 percent of the total accumulated saving to consumers from nuclear-generated electricity. Finally, the claim that nuclear-power plants are wearing out quicker than expected is incorrect. Utilities are planning to relicense and run many plants well beyond the largely arbitrary 30 to 40 years of their initial license. This will bring enormous savings to the consumer since virtually almost all the cost of nuclear power is the cost of building the plant, which will have been paid for during the first few decades of operation.

The deadline to apply for the funds was originally this week, but federal officials just postponed it until July. A PG&E spokeswoman, Suzanne Hosn, said on Thursday that the agency was open to exploring different options “if the state determines Diablo Canyon is needed” to keep its energy grid reliable. PG&E would likely need approval from state and federal regulators to prolong the life of its nuclear reactors. “The extension is giving us more time to review and evaluate the application criteria and the process,” Hosn told me. “We’re seeing whether and how Diablo fits into the funding opportunity should the state want to move forward.” Built near Avila Beach in San Luis Obispo County, Diablo Canyon first went online in 1985 during an era of heavy opposition to nuclear power. A young Jerry Brown, serving his first stint as governor, protested the facility years before it opened. There had been a partial meltdown of a nuclear reactor in Pennsylvania in 1979, and then, in 1986, the infamous Chernobyl disaster. But Californians’ views toward nuclear energy have shifted over the past few decades.

Safety, storage and security are significant obstacles, the last two of which may be insurmountable. Ten seismic faults lie within a 20-mile radius of Yucca Mountain, located 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas. And scaling up nuclear power would require the capacity of one “Yucca Mountain” every 5 to 10 years until the midcentury. Nuclear plants take a decade to build, and estimates for the cost of a nuclear plant have just doubled from $6 billion to $12 billion. Replacing carbon waste with radioactive waste is not healthy and probably not insurable. A better proposal, offered by Al Gore, is to build a cleanly powered smart grid. With a 10-year timetable and a cost of $1.5 trillion to $3 trillion, such a grid would maximize the benefits and minimize the potential consequences for our health and the global environment. Paul R.

Vogtle nuclear-power generating station sometimes describe it as being in the middle of nowhere, and in many respects they're right: situated on a bend in the Savannah River, in the thick pine forests of central Georgia, the plant is an hour south of Augusta and a two-hour drive, if you disobey the speed limit, from the outskirts of Atlanta. On the final approach to Vogtle, a narrow country road cuts through vast stretches of undeveloped land punctuated with small ranch-style homes; in some places, you can still discern remnants of convenience stores and cheap motels set back from the pavement, all now shuttered, some barely standing. When Vogtle (pronounced VOH-gull) was being built in the 1970's and 80's, it was more aptly described as the middle of everything, a bustling, improvised city of engineers and tradesmen, some 14,000 workers in all, many of whom lived nearby in tents and trailers. It was one of the largest construction projects in the history of Georgia. An entire concrete factory, now defunct, was built here during that time; so was a factory to manufacture ice, a necessary ingredient in making the superdense nuclear-grade concrete required for the reactor-containment buildings. To Ellie Daniel, a local man who has worked as an administrator at Vogtle for more than two decades, only two significant things have happened in the history of Georgia's Burke County. ''One is the Civil War,'' he told me. ''The other is Plant Vogtle.'' The boom that swept through the region as Vogtle rose from the forest floor -- its immense cooling towers are each 548 feet tall -- ended somewhat badly, however, at least in a financial sense. The plant took almost 15 years to move from blueprints to being operational. And by the time it began producing electricity in the late 1980's, its total cost, $8.87 billion, was so far overbudget that Vogtle became yet another notorious example of the evils of nuclear energy. In the public mind, the issue was safety. For the industry, the larger concern was economics. Indeed, as originally designed in the early 1970's, Vogtle was intended to generate a total of around 4,500 megawatts of electricity, enough power to serve the needs of several million homes. The grand plan was to have four reactors. Instead, it was scaled back to two, Vogtle Unit 1 (finished in 1987) and Vogtle Unit 2 (1989). Today these reactors together produce about 2,400 megawatts, satisfying about 15 percent of the state's power needs. One day this May, on a brisk morning so clear that I could see its cooling towers from 20 miles away, I visited Vogtle on one leg of a tour to assess what many in the energy industry are calling a nuclear renaissance. Thanks partly to large government incentives and to market forces that have pushed the price of other electric plant fuels (especially natural gas) to historic heights, the prospect of starting a new nuclear reactor in this country for the first time in 30 years has become increasingly likely. By early summer a dozen utilities around the country had informed the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees all civilian nuclear activity in this country, that they were interested in building 18 new facilities, nearly all of which would be sited next to existing nuclear reactors. Vogtle was in this group of 18. In fact, the Southern Company, the large utility that runs Vogtle, also announced that it would formally apply to the N.R.C. next month for an early site permit, the first step in readying the community for a nuclear project that would complement the existing reactors. Whether Vogtle will turn out to be the 1st, 5th or 10th next-generation plant to break new ground is difficult to say; trying to predict which utility will be able to overcome formidable obstacles -- public approval, regulatory scrutiny, billions in financing and complex engineering challenges -- is akin to predicting the winner of a presidential election years in advance. Still, if things move smoothly (a rarity when it comes to nuclear power in this country), the Southern Company will receive a license to build and operate a new plant in 2010. Construction will take five years. Electricity will begin to flow to the residents of Georgia in 2015. Over the past year, the debate over nuclear power has increasingly been framed as an environmental one, as several commentators -- most notably Patrick Moore, a founder of Greenpeace (and now estranged from the organization); the British conservationist James Lovelock; and the Whole Earth Catalog founder Stewart Brand -- have stepped forward to assert that global warming requires an embrace of new nuclear plants, because unlike gas- or coal-powered plants, nuclear reactors produce electricity without emitting greenhouse gasses. The nuclear industry, in turn, has capitalized on the chance to adopt a green tinge, or at least greenish one; among its recent slogans is the exhortation to ''Go nuclear: because you care about the air.'' Most environmental groups have not softened their opposition, however. ''This is more a propaganda exercise than a serious discussion of the viability of the industry,'' Jim Riccio, the nuclear policy analyst at Greenpeace, told me. By using global warming, he added, ''the nuclear industry is trying to find some fear greater than the nuclear fear to be their selling point.'' Nonetheless, whether any new nuclear plants are built in the United States depends less on the sentiments of the American public than on the country's individual utilities. And for conglomerates like the Southern Company, which runs Vogtle as well as two other nuclear plants in Georgia and Alabama, the determining factor is not air quality. It's money. Over the next 12 to 24 months, as utilities like Southern determine what to do, their fundamental concern is the bottom-line cost. And the feeling among many in the industry is that the financial prospects are almost certainly looking up. One afternoon at Vogtle, Ellie Daniel took me just west of the plant. The reactors here sit amid 3,150 acres of wilderness; the snap of pine in the air and the low hills that roll toward the riverbank lend it the serenity of a fine vacation spot. We drove past the old concrete factory, past the crumbling foundation of the ice works and halted by a clearing at the side of the road. At the edge of the clearing, small pine trees had been planted in neat lines, stretching like vineyard rows up the hill to Vogtle Units 1 and 2. The ground beneath our feet was covered in a carpet of fallen needles. It's all part of the effort to preserve the area as a pristine environment, Daniel explained to me: ''We're trying to return the area to how it looked before we built here.'' Much of this will be swept away, though, if plans progress the way the Southern Company hopes. In the clearing, some engineers at Vogtle had painted a green circle, about 60 feet in diameter, to mark the location and size of the planned reactor building. And in the center of the circle was a pole, also painted green, to mark the hot reactor core. This would be Vogtle Unit 3, Daniel said. Not far off, perhaps a few hundred yards, was another pole and another green circle. If you can imagine it, he added, this would be Vogtle Unit 4. Hard Times After T.M.I. On the evening before my visit to Vogtle, the prospect of new reactors at the site was the subject of a public meeting, convened by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, at a technical college in Waynesboro, Ga., a small town about 30 minutes from the plant. Anyone intrigued or appalled by the idea of new construction could come to ask questions. These kinds of community gatherings have become a frequent occurrence around the country over the past year as utilities have shown a renewed interest in building reactors. ''We're in what's called the preapplication space for Plant Vogtle,'' David Matthews, the head of new-reactor licensing at the N.R.C., told me as people milled about before the evening meeting. Matthews brought a dozen colleagues with him -- engineers and science advisers, mainly -- to address any technical points that might arise after he made a few brief remarks explaining the N.R.C. licensing process. But some attendees had come not so much to ask questions as to encourage the Southern Company to build Units 3 and 4. ''Can you do it any quicker?'' asked one representative from the local chamber of commerce. Meanwhile, a number of antinuclear advocates wanted to quiz the commission officials about the possible hazards of a new plant design and the plant's radioactive (and highly toxic) spent fuel; some had even set up tables to distribute brochures alongside the agency's own informational pamphlets. The rancorous debates that defined these sorts of public meetings two decades ago were largely absent: the exchanges followed a protocol that kept tempers in check while lending the meeting a formality that N.R.C. representatives, all dressed in formal business attire, tried to promote. Vogtle Units 3 and 4 were serious business. The received wisdom about the United States nuclear industry is that it began a long and inexorable decline immediately after the near meltdown, in 1979, at Three Mile Island in central Pennsylvania, an accident that -- in one of those rare alignments of Hollywood fantasy and real-world events -- was preceded by the release of the film ''The China Syndrome'' two weeks earlier. To be sure, the events at T.M.I., as those in the industry invariably refer to it, as well as the radioactive steam explosion at Chernobyl seven years later, galvanized public opinion against nuclear power as never before. In the case of Long Island's Shoreham plant, steadfast community opposition eventually stopped a newly finished plant from ever operating. But the fortunes of the nuclear business have been defined by many factors that aren't so conspicuous. Several years before T.M.I., the growing expense of new nuclear projects, coupled with the realization that many predictions for future electricity demand were overblown, had already hobbled the business. New orders for plants had fallen off drastically by 1978. ''The industry was in a depressed state,'' says J. Samuel Walker, the historian at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ''And what T.M.I. did was finish things off.'' In fact, T.M.I. didn't kill the industry. It killed the growth of the industry -- ensuring, in a way, that nuclear power would not assume more than a fraction of the U.S. electric business. The last year a plant was approved for construction by the N.R.C. was 1978. But interminable construction schedules meant that many facilities approved before T.M.I., like Plant Vogtle in Georgia, were finished long after the accident. Some didn't even start generating power until a few years ago; the last was the Watts Bar plant in eastern Tennessee, which began operations in 1996. Since then the contribution of nuclear energy to our electrical grid has remained fairly steady. All told, the 103 active nuclear reactors in the United States supply about 20 percent of our electricity. And in some places the contribution is much larger. New York gets 29 percent of its power from nuclear energy, New Jersey 52 percent. Abroad, nuclear energy has its hot spots too -- in France, for instance, 78 percent of the electricity comes from nuclear energy. There are currently 337 working reactors in 30 countries outside the United States, and there may soon be many more, as India and China embark upon ambitious plans to build dozens over the next decade to satisfy their thirst for electricity. In the U.S., each of the commercial nuclear plants has been granted a 40-year operating license by the N.R.C. This life span was originally based upon the hypotheses of engineers and physicists in the early 1960's who weren't sure how long a large nuclear plant could safely operate, because none had ever been built before. While there have been numerous incidents of mechanical defects over the past few decades, the 40-year projection has by and large proved a conservative estimate, and in the past few years, the N.R.C. has been granting 20-year extensions so that some older plants that pass workplace inspections can run for a total of 60 years. Even with such licensing renewals, though, it's doubtful the current fleet of plants will run for, say, 80 years. When I visited Nils Diaz, the longtime chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, who retired at the end of June, he pointed out that even if one passed muster for safety, a plant that old might require so much upkeep as to make it uneconomical. That means the industry, in a way, is in a race against time. Recently, Paul Joskow, a professor of economics at M.I.T., sent me a chart that looks ahead to the output of America's reactors over the next half-century. As the current 103 nuclear reactors continue to generate electricity for the next few decades, the line on the chart remains mostly flat. But then the plants' electricity production falls off a cliff. ''I think this is the first time in many years, perhaps 20 years, that the combination of government policy, economic conditions and environmental constraints are reasonably favorable for nuclear,'' Joskow told me. ''If they can't move forward now, it would be very difficult in the longer run.'' It may even be more urgent than that. One conclusion to be derived from the chart is that nuclear power in this country is dying. Unless someone starts building soon, it will begin to disappear in 15 or 20 years, as one plant after another exhausts its operating permit and goes dark. And it will effectively be extinguished as an energy source by around 2050. For those with deep misgivings about the safety and expense of nuclear plants, life without them may indeed be a cause for celebration. Yet their absence would probably pose tremendous challenges for the United States. The first is where 20 percent of our power would come from; the second is whether a substitute fuel for that power would emit carbon dioxide. It is, in many ways, a long-term dilemma, one closely related to global warming, and one that is poorly suited to a society that focuses on short-term results. For Wall Street, which concerns itself with our publicly traded utilities' quarterly earnings, the primary worry is whether companies (and investors) that choose nuclear power will quickly be saddled with burdensome debts. For elected officials, the main concern is whether support for nuclear energy will hurt or help their standing in the next election cycle. Yet to spend a few months listening to those who study the earth's energy resources is to get the feeling that we are in for a very difficult century -- and one that depends on an immediate future of difficult and unpleasant choices. ''If you want a different energy system in 2050, you really have to start changing it now,'' says John Holdren, a Harvard professor and one of the country's most esteemed thinkers on energy and the environment. ''You can't get there and say, 'Oh, I want a different energy system.' '' Pick Your Poison When it comes to America's future energy needs, one of the larger points of confusion is the somewhat tangled relationship between fossil fuels and electricity. Current prices at the gas pump, for instance, or the possibility that we are approaching a moment of ''peak oil'' -- the point at which the global supply of crude peaks and then diminishes forever, with cataclysmic consequences for transportation, trucking and the economy in general -- actually have little to do with the future supply of power. Making electricity is generally about creating a source of heat and steam, and using that steam to turn giant turbines and generate power. Less than 3 percent of our electric power is generated from oil. Besides the 20 percent contribution from nuclear power, 50 percent of our electricity comes from burning coal, 18 percent from burning natural gas and (in a heat-free method that is often the cheapest) 6.5 percent by harnessing the energy of water moving through dams. Wind and solar power make up less than one-half of 1 percent of what we use on a typical day. In part because the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine (and in part because wind turbines and solar cells are expensive to build) neither technology is yet good enough to generate large, reliable quantities of inexpensive electricity, or what utility companies call ''base load'' power. At at some point in the future, oil and electricity may fight for supremacy: Toyota recently announced it is developing a plug-in car in addition to its hybrids, for instance, and electricity has the potential to help manufacture clean-burning fuels like hydrogen for the future. Over the past few years, the executives at Georgia Power, a division of the Southern Company as well as the utility that owns the majority share of the Vogtle plant, have tracked the population growth of the region and tried to look ahead, as all utilities do, at what the demand for electricity might be several decades from now. At the moment, the company's 20-year projections suggest that power needs in the region will grow by 30 percent. So that's one consideration. Another is that some outmoded plants in their system will need to be replaced. Building Vogtle Units 3 and 4 would, essentially, be a bet that a nuclear power plant will be superior to a new coal or gas plant in the long run. ''I think based on what we know today, it would be the best option, but there's still a lot of work to be done,'' Oscar Harper, a vice president at Georgia Power, told me. Yet even if Georgia Power makes a decision in favor of nuclear, it still needs the state's public utility board to agree that it's in the best interest of Georgia residents. None of this is assured. Moreover, what makes the choice of fuels such a knotty problem is that something that is cheap now, like coal, may not be so cheap in 10 years. This isn't because we're running out; we probably have at least a century's worth of coal reserves in the United States alone. But if the government were to impose a tax or a cap on carbon emissions, something that almost everyone I spoke with in the energy industry believes is inevitable, or if new laws mandate that coal plants must adopt more expensive technologies to burn the coal cleaner -- or to ''sequester'' the carbon-dioxide byproducts underground -- the financial equation will change: a kilowatt-hour generated by coal suddenly becomes more expensive. There are other contingencies at play, too: fuels, like natural gas, could experience a supply interruption that leads to enormous price spikes. As for the hope that wind and solar power will generate large amounts of clean, affordable electricity in the near future? I encountered great skepticism inside and outside the utility companies. ''Maybe in 40 years,'' Paul Joskow, of M.I.T., told me. Meanwhile, nuclear power has several appealing factors: the cost of uranium is fairly low, the supply is abundant (and mostly found in countries friendly to the United States) and big plants like Vogtle can generate large amounts of inexpensive electricity. The fuel, which takes the shape of thousands of pellets that are loaded inside long metal tubes and then placed into the reactor core, is strikingly potent; just a few pellets stacked together to resemble the size, shape and color of a black crayon can generate enough electricity for an entire family for a year. On the other hand, the list of negatives is long. Uranium mining is a messy business, and some Western states are still cleaning up the detritus of mines and mills from a half-century ago. A catastrophic reactor accident here or abroad -- one that could be the equivalent of a so-called dirty bomb, killing thousands and rendering hundreds of square miles of surrounding land uninhabitable -- would immediately destroy any revival of the industry. Then there are byproducts and proliferation. Until the Yucca Mountain underground repository in Nevada is completed (and the site probably will not be approved for construction before 2011), spent fuel has to stay on the site of nuclear facilities. And the possibility of irradiated fuel in the hands of a terrorist or rogue government has become increasingly worrisome in recent years. The most immediate challenges, at least for the utilities, are the capital costs of building new plants, which when factored into the cost of the electricity, as they need to be, have a history of striking terror into the hearts of public-utility board members. A coal plant costs significantly less than a nuclear plant -- as much as 50 percent less -- and a gas plant is much cheaper than a coal plant. When I asked David Ratcliffe, the C.E.O. of the Southern Company, about the choice he's facing at Vogtle, he explained: ''When you line up the three fundamental technologies -- gas, coal and nuclear -- you're lining them up from lowest capital cost and lowest construction time to greatest capital cost and greatest construction time. You're also lining them up from greatest fuel-price volatility to least fuel-price volatility.'' Probably the best comparison of gas, coal and nuclear energy was done with Joskow's help in 2003, when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published an exhaustive analysis of the future of nuclear power. The M.I.T. study concluded that nuclear energy is competitive, but only under certain circumstances. One instance is if the costs of building a plant are significantly reduced (by shortening the length of construction, for example). Another is if coal and natural-gas plants are taxed on carbon emissions. Because nuclear plants don't produce carbon dioxide and wouldn't be taxed, their electricity could conceivably cost no more to generate than that from coal and gas, or even less. There is a counterargument to building large new power plants. One view -- voiced most forcefully, perhaps, by Amory Lovins, a physicist who runs Rocky Mountain Institute, which advises corporations and utilities on energy efficiency -- is that we don't need to increase our electrical supply. We need to decrease demand by rewarding utilities for getting customers to reduce electricity use by, say, updating their appliances, furnaces and lighting. Lovins, a longtime critic of nuclear power, contends that it remains financially uncompetitive and that the 30-year absence of new plants is proof that the market has rejected nuclear power as a viable technology. When we spoke about whether utilities need to build more big generating plants in this country, he told me no -- not now, not in 15 years, not even after that. ''I think if you do,'' he remarked, ''your shareholders and ratepayers will be asking awkward questions that you would really rather not want to answer.'' Yet the concern, even among Lovins's admirers, is that if he is mistaken -- that is, if either his estimates on efficiencies can't accommodate population and industrial growth, or because what is possible in principle for energy efficiency is not possible in the real world -- then the utilities will require an alternative plan. And that would entail more supply, likely meaning more big base-load plants (whether they rely on uranium, gas or coal) as well as large investments in renewable sources like wind and solar power. When I asked John Holdren at Harvard whether the potential for efficiencies is as large as Lovins says, he replied, ''The savings could be huge.'' Yet Holdren also maintains that creating a clean and reliable energy supply for the future is going to be so daunting that nothing should be taken off the table. Clean coal, renewables, nuclear -- we'll need them all. To those in the electricity business, this is known as creating an energy portfolio: build everything, use everything and rely on nothing exclusively. ''I'll be very happy if Amory's right,'' Holdren added, ''but I'd like to hedge my bets.'' For 30 years the debate has been defined by a perfect and almost maddening symmetry, not only in terms of opinion but also of facts. The answer to whether nuclear power is risky can be framed many ways, for instance: you can tally the number of injuries and deaths to citizens from U.S. nuclear plants (zero) or consider the potential number of injuries and deaths in a serious accident (many). Is nuclear power clean because it doesn't produce carbon? Or is it dirty because it produces radioactive waste? Is it very expensive? Or are the economics competitive over the long run, especially if fossil fuels are taxed for warming the planet? The AP1000, the Latest Thing in Plant Designs For a utility that wants to go shopping for a nuclear plant, there are no blueprints floating around to help you do it yourself. If you have access to $2 billion or $3 billion, you pretty much have only three options. You can begin negotiations with General Electric or a French company called Areva for their newest designs, known as the E.S.B.W.R. and the E.P.R., respectively. Or you can start talking with Westinghouse, as the Southern Company has done, and check out its new reactor, the AP1000. If the Southern Company's Georgia Power division decides to build Vogtle Units 3 and 4, this is the model. Unlike G.E.'s and Areva's models, the Westinghouse design was approved and certified this year, after a complex multiyear process, by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Still, as I was reminded during my tour of Vogtle, an AP1000 has never been built anywhere in the world. Westinghouse's offices are about 30 minutes outside Pittsburgh, in a complex of squat, black, glassy modernist boxes that seem to have been dropped gently from the heavens onto a campus of several hundred verdant acres. The company continues to license its all-American name for home appliances, and its switchboard still gets calls every December from homeowners having trouble with their old Westinghouse Christmas lights. But this is now a nuclear company, and a nuclear company only, from top to bottom: Westinghouse services existing plants, sells fuel and sells new plant designs. All its other divisions have been shed, most of them during a corporate fire sale in the 1990's. ''At that point in time, we didn't anticipate nuclear coming back here in the U.S.,'' Steve Tritch, the company's C.E.O., told me when I met with him in his office. So Westinghouse looked to Europe and Asia for new plants and concentrated on selling fuel and consulting services. ''Barring some tremendous technological discovery that was going to produce energy, my own personal belief was that if you looked at the basic situation with fossil fuels, then nuclear was going to be used again here,'' Tritch said. Still, in those days he assumed that Westinghouse wouldn't see much new business in the U.S. until perhaps 2015. About two-thirds of the plants in the United States are based on Westinghouse designs, including Vogtle Units 1 and 2 and the first commercial reactor ever built in this country, in Shippingport, Pa., which began producing power in 1957. In the mid-1950's, the Atomic Energy Commission, the forerunner of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, allowed the development of nuclear power for civilian uses. The fuel was to be far less volatile than that used in a weapon, which is why a nuclear plant can't be detonated like an atomic bomb. Yet it took at least another decade before the industry gained any traction, and much of the early momentum came from government financing and the willingness of companies like G.E. and Westinghouse to sell plants for tremendous discounts. Many utilities couldn't resist. In the early years, most of the engineers who designed plants came out of the U.S. Navy program for nuclear submarines, which explains the industry preference for nautical terminology (the ''fleet'') and to some extent its nautical design motifs. Walking through the industrial interiors of Plant Vogtle and of Grand Gulf, a nuclear plant I visited in Mississippi, I had the odd sensation of being in the hold of an immense freighter, bound for somewhere. In retrospect, the nuclear dream of the 1950's and 60's was at least partly delusional. Those infamous predictions from the early days -- that nuclear power would be ''too cheap to meter,'' as Lewis Strauss, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, told a conference of science writers in 1954, or that the country was destined to have the nuclear power of 1,000 plants by the year 2000, as the commission predicted in the early 1970's -- seem farcical in light of what transpired in building the plants: the billions in overruns, the endless years of construction. Steve Tritch told me that inside the Westinghouse offices in the 1980's, executives kept a list of domestic plants they expected would be decommissioned even before their 40-year licenses expired. The trend for utilities was to get out of nuclear power as fast as possible, not in. The so-called renaissance may turn out to be just a brief flurry of enthusiasm, entailing the construction of a few new plants over the next decade. But if nuclear power does catch on again -- and there are a number of reasons to think it might, the most obvious being strong government encouragement driven by the attitude that a portfolio of energy options creates a more stable economy -- then the seeds of its revival would almost certainly date back to the late 1980's and early 1990's. At that point, it was clear that the industry had massive, intractable problems. Most of the plants in the country were of customized designs, making repairs difficult and efficiencies of scale challenging. Many utilities had no expertise in operating a nuclear plant even after purchasing one. Meanwhile, the process for getting a facility approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was done in two steps: first a construction permit and then, years later, an operating permit. The process all but ensured long delays and wasted resources as N.R.C. regulators identified construction errors and design shortcomings at very late stages and as legal opponents challenged the licensing process over the course of many years. At around that time, a number of nuclear-friendly groups focused on hammering out a strategic long-term recovery plan for the industry. One of these, the Nuclear Power Oversight Committee, made up of several utility executives, created a blueprint for an industry revival that bears an uncanny resemblance to the way things are turning out today. ''They said you have to have a new licensing regime at the N.R.C., because we can never have a Shoreham again,'' Ed Cummins, Westinghouse's chief engineer, told me. Shoreham, estimated to cost about $260 million in the 1960's, before construction started, was completed in 1984 for $5.5 billion, sold to New York State for $1 in 1992 and immediately decommissioned. Cummins also recalled that the oversight-committee plan listed about 15 other industry and regulatory changes before anyone would again consider building new nuclear plants. Many of the resolutions involved safety features and maintenance. If nuclear power were to ever get another chance, a new fleet of plants had to be standardized in design, easier to build and simpler to maintain. Above all, of course, they had to be far, far less expensive. The Business of Nuclear Power No two factors have been quite so important to the revived prospects for nuclear power as the high price of natural gas and large incentives offered by the Department of Energy, amounting to several hundred million dollars, to help finance the first few reactors. But there have been a great number of helpful factors inside the industry too. By the late 1990's, for instance, several utilities, notably Exelon (based in Illinois) and Entergy Nuclear (Mississippi), had developed specialties in buying and operating nuclear plants. With Westinghouse's help, the companies proved that refueling the plants, a complex choreography that occurs every 18 months or so and results in the temporary shutdown of the plant, could be done in about 35 days rather than the customary 60 or 70. The profits in decreasing that refueling period (many nuclear plants take in revenue of about $1 million a day) have been tremendous. Indeed, the companies became so adept at refueling and day-to-day operations that they began acquiring old nuclear plants whose owners either didn't want them or couldn't manage them. And they have proved that building a nuclear plant and buying a nuclear plant are entirely different business propositions. A company like Entergy, for instance, has purchased",2006-07-16T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,technology

I live eight miles from an earthquake-prone coastline, the home of Diablo Canyon’s two nuclear reactors and highly radioactive nuclear waste. This waste is growing daily. There’s no plan for its removal because there’s nowhere to put it. It is irresponsible and fatuous to support new nukes when all of our energy needs can be met by conservation and renewables. Leaving the “poison fire” for our great-grandchildren to deal with is neither sustainable nor sensible. Linda Seeley San Luis Obispo, Calif., Feb. 19, 2010  To the Editor: It is true that right now is the time to encourage investment in new nuclear plants, and that the loan guarantees are a necessity. Nuclear plants bring the jobs we want, demanding skilled labor and large-scale, high-technology construction. They have demonstrated over the last 20 years that they can be run safely and efficiently. The history of the 1970s and 1980s is that it was the government and the legal system that bogged down nuclear construction and ran up the costs. They created the skittish financial market for nuclear, and they need to help provide the assurance that it will not happen again. Neil B. Morley Los Angeles, Feb. 18, 2010 The writer is senior research scientist, Fusion Science and Technology Center, University of California, Los Angeles.  To the Editor: Uranium 235 is exhaustible; in fact, we have more coal than uranium. If breeder reactors are used, their plutonium 239 requires no further concentration to build “dirty” nuclear bombs. Nuclear power is also dangerous because the temporary casks used for storing fuel rods can be penetrated by regular weapons, and there are no other options, as there are no permanent storage facilities anywhere in the world. An additional risk is cyber-terrorism through the Internet, which has already been attempted in Ohio. On top of all this, renewable energy costs less than nuclear. Further investments in a nuclear future take economic resources away from the conversion to a clean and inexhaustible energy future. President Obama’s support of nuclear energy will also support his being a one-term president. Béla Lipták Stamford, Conn., Feb. 18, 2010 The writer is the editor of the Environmental Engineers’ Handbook.  To the Editor:  Your support for President Obama’s nuclear energy plans is one of the most disappointing editorials I have ever read in your paper. I suspect that you were able to support them only by closing your mind to at least one key question: What will be done with the nuclear waste? No one has come up with an answer for that in decades. Perhaps with your enthusiasm for the president’s plan you could volunteer your backyard as a burying ground, but somehow I don’t think you’d see that as reasonable.

3c580d71-953e-5f59-aa30-0cc013b9ce75,https://www.tipsproject.eu/tips/,China Deal Gives Lift to Revival of Fission,"PARIS, Nov. 26 — Areva, the French nuclear power giant, signed the largest deal in the industry’s history Monday, with China’s leading nuclear power company. The agreement will bring both technology and much-needed energy to China, which has the world’s fastest-growing appetite for energy. But the deal could prove an even greater boon to Anne Lauvergeon, Areva’s chief executive, whose strategies — and optimism — have been questioned by critics. The reasons for skepticism are clear. In recent years, nuclear-powered countries — like the United States, Germany and Japan — have refrained from building more plants, and countries like Italy and Poland, who had none, have refused to plunge into the nuclear age. But as today’s deal illustrates, the business of nuclear energy has come alive again, and it is people like Ms. Lauvergeon, her steely temper softened by a lively manner and a captivating laugh, that are bringing it back to life. “A nuclear renaissance is now gearing up everywhere in the world,” said John B. Ritch III, a former American diplomat and director general of the World Nuclear Association, an industry group. “It is occurring parallel to an enormous expansion in energy consumption.” The daughter of a professor and the niece of an archaeologist, Ms. Lauvergeon felt drawn to antiquity as a girl — until her uncle took her on her first dig one summer. “I discovered it was a lot of dirt, dirty hands, and crawling around on all fours,” Ms. Lauvergeon, 48, said, explaining how her interest shifted from the past to the future. Ms. Lauvergeon’s long path from dirty hands to clean energy took some unexpected turns, including ones through the halls of power at the Élysées Palace, where she served as a top adviser to François Mitterrand, and into the bastions of the very male business world, leaving her, in the end, one of the most powerful women in corporate Europe. Ms. Lauvergeon grew up in Orleans, the heartland of France, where her father was a professor of geography. Her interest in the past gradually made way for college studies in chemistry and physics, leading to a degree from the École des Mines in Paris, an elite engineering school. After graduation she worked for several French companies, including the former Usinor steel company, now part of the Arcelor-Mittal steel group. In the first half of the 1990’s, she was Mr. Mitterrand’s lead aide on international trade issues. In 1995, she became a partner in Paris at Lazard Frères, spending several months in the investment bank’s New York office. Today, Ms. Lauvergeon spends much of her time on the road, selling Areva’s nuclear products and services. When she is in Paris, she makes time to drop off her two children, ages 8 and 4, at their private school. “I started late,” she confesses. Her husband, Olivier, is also in business. Even as the nuclear industry opens new projects around the globe, the industry has been consolidating. After Toshiba ’s $5.4 billion takeover of Westinghouse, General Electric and Hitachi joined forces in a $2 billion deal. Russia has carved Atomstroyexport, the Russian nuclear power company, out of the old Soviet atomic energy ministry. In France, Ms. Lauvergeon assembled Areva in 2001 from the bickering factions of France’s state-owned nuclear establishment, the fuel company Cogema and the reactor builder Framatome, creating arguably the world’s only one-stop nuclear shop, selling uranium, reactors, fuel reprocessing and waste storage. It was around this time that she first visited a nuclear reactor. “It was clean, very modern, and I was impressed by the idea that a tiny amount of uranium produced a huge amount of energy,” she said. And this, she added, despite her being at the time, “very ecolo,” French slang for environmentalist. “At the time, many said we had no future,” she recalled. “I said, ‘We have a future, and we should invest.’ In this new situation, we’re very attractive.” Of course, much of the increasing appeal of nuclear power has to do with the rising cost of oil and the need to reduce the level of greenhouse emissions. Companies like Westinghouse, General Electric and Areva, which design and build nuclear power plants, are taking advantage, landing contracts in Asia and even turning their sights on Western countries, like the United States. “It’s not expensive, and the costs are totally predictable,” Ms. Lauvergeon said recently in her office in a meticulously restored Art Deco building in the center of Paris. “The cost of uranium is only 5 percent of your costs.” Moreover, she said, nuclear energy is not dependent on foreign sources of fuel and produces no greenhouse gases. Not everyone shares her enthusiasm. “Currently there is no safe way to deal with radioactive waste,” said Nathan Argent, who follows the industry for Greenpeace, one of many antinuclear groups. They argue, moreover, that the spread of nuclear technology leads to the proliferation of atomic weapons. Ms. Lauvergeon insists Areva is not in the business of proliferation. “Without ambiguity, we don’t accept to do business with countries that don’t accept, without doubt, international controls,” she said. Some governments heed their antinuclear constituencies. Germany, once a leader in nuclear energy, is committed to exiting nuclear energy by 2020; Sweden is similarly committed to phase out its nuclear plants by 2010. But Ms. Lauvergeon highlights Areva’s experience in converting spent fuel into mixed oxide, or MOX, pellets that can be burned in nuclear reactors. She can speak with conviction because France, unlike most of the world, never backed away from atomic power. Roughly 80 percent of the country’s electricity is generated by nuclear plants. The new government of President Nicolas Sarkozy is giving Ms. Lauvergeon a helping hand. Addressing the United Nations, and on trips to Mediterranean countries, notably Libya and Morocco, Mr. Sarkozy has promoted French nuclear technology. And he was present at the signing of the Areva-CGNPG agreement, according to Xinhua. Areva will supply the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group with two cutting-edge nuclear reactors in the city of Taishan in the southern province of Quangdong. Areva will also help run and maintain the plants, whose design will include a European pressurized water reactor, or EPR. Under the 8 billion euro ($11.86 billion) deal, Areva will also cooperate with the Chinese on future civilian nuclear energy, including the reprocessing of spent fuel. In the first nine months of 2007 Areva generated revenue of $11.6 billion, up 6.8 percent from the year before, building power plants, but also mining and processing uranium, and disposing of spent fuel. Its order book in the first half-year was up 30 percent, at $45 billion, before the Chinese deal. Areva is currently building two new EPR plants in France and in Finland. But Ms. Lauvergeon faces strong competition from companies like Westinghouse, General Electric and Atomstroyexport. She says she is not fazed, noting that Areva is taking the battle to Westinghouse’s home turf: it reached a joint venture with Constellation Energy, a Baltimore utility, to sell its power plants in the United States, and it is cooperating with Électricité de France, the French utility, to penetrate the American market. Now Areva needs cash to grow, and the French government is considering all options, including selling shares in Areva. Less than 5 percent of Areva trades on the Paris exchange, in nonvoting investment certificates; a possible merger with the French turbinemaker Alstom would create an even more muscular competitor. This likelihood has driven Areva’s shares up more than 50 percent over the last year. Ms. Lauvergeon says she favors joining with “one or two industrial partners.” But the centerpiece of Ms. Lauvergeon’s sales pitch is of course the EPR, which she has sold to China. Areva is building the first of its kind in a dark pine forest in Finland. But the Finnish project is years behind schedule and news reports have set cost overruns as high as $1 billion. Ms. Lauvergeon, who says Areva does not publish the provisions it makes for such losses, acknowledges that the company is unlikely to make money on the project. But she even puts an optimistic spin on the loss. “It’s an investment, an incredible show window,” she says. Apparently, the Chinese agreed.",2007-11-27T06:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business

The unit that had the accident, which led to a partial meltdown of the reactor's fuel core on March 28, 1979, was permanently shut down. The adjacent unit -- the one to be sold -- has been operating steadily and received good performance ratings by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission last September. It produces electricity at about 4.1 cents a kilowatt-hour, making it attractive to some large utilities and other companies seeking to buy power plants and become sellers of low-cost power. The unit is a well-run, low-cost plant that should attract bids, analysts said. ''Other than its name, it's an attractive plant,'' said Steven M. Fetter, a utility analyst with Fitch Research. GPU's announcement comes after it said it would consider selling its Oyster Creek nuclear plant in New Jersey, which has higher operating costs, and replace its output by buying power on the wholesale market. The electric utility industry is being deregulated, with some states, including New Jersey, planning to begin opening utilities to competition in 1998. The goal is to reduce rates by 5 to 10 percent. As the drive to deregulate has picked up, the industry has begun to split: companies that will become mostly suppliers of low-cost power, marketing it throughout the nation, and those that will shrink and become transmission and service companies that buy power from the lowest-cost sources. John T. Fidler, the corporate affairs director for GPU, said yesterday that GPU had been heading in the direction of becoming mostly a transmission and service company. ''There is so much surplus power out there that it's now no longer a high concern for us of where we get that power,'' he said. GPU Inc. is a holding company that owns three utilities: Jersey Central Power and Light, Metropolitan Edison and Pennsylvania Electric, which serve 1.9 million customers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. GPU already buys a large part of its power from others. Mr. Fetter, the Fitch Research analyst, said that large utilities like the Duke Power Company and the Southern Company, which have had long experience in building and operating nuclear plants, had expressed an interest in acquiring nuclear plants. Mr. Fidler said that several companies had said they were interested in buying Oyster Creek and then had asked whether Three Mile Island was for sale. The company has said that it has about $600 million invested in Three Mile Island and $700 million in Oyster Creek. What could complicate a sale is that GPU estimates that it has $1.3 billion left in investment that it has not recovered in the two plants. If the purchase price does not cover that investment, then regulators would have to determine how much, if any, of what is left would be passed on to customers as rate rises. GPU said a sale of the nuclear plants would have to be approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Shares of GPU rose 50 cents yesterday, to $32.875.",1997-05-03T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business

The eight plants would produce electricity only during the summer and other peak periods to complement the two nuclear generators already at the site in Buchanan, 35 miles north of New York City. The $250 million project would probably be completed in the spring of 2004, said Jim Steets, an Entergy spokesman. But the prospect of housing sizable gas and nuclear facilities less than a quarter-mile apart is already worrying some elected officials, environmental groups and local residents. And the proposal offers a vivid reminder of how so many critical and interlocking issues revolve around energy and environment in New York's northern suburbs. Indian Point's reactors are in the most densely populated area around any nuclear plant in the country. Some officials and environmental groups are concerned that the rare combination of combustible gas and radioactive waste could create a major safety risk in the event of an accident. According to Neil Sheehan, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the only other plant that has ever accommodated gas and nuclear power simultaneously is Oyster Creek, in rural Lacey Township, in southern New Jersey. The plans for the gas plants, while not unexpected, also come at an awkward time for Indian Point. Some local officials have called for the temporary closing of the plants, fearful that they could become terrorist targets. Last week, the Westchester County Legislature ordered a feasibility study on converting the nuclear operation to gas. And last night, some legislators began to circulate petitions demanding that the gas plants be blocked unless Indian Point abandons or converts its nuclear operations. But the nuclear-to-gas conversion is fraught with complications, too. Indian Point would require a bigger supply of gas than is now possible through an existing pipeline running through the site. And that supply, presumably, would have to come from another source: in all likelihood, the highly controversial Millennium Pipeline, a proposed 422-mile high-pressure natural gas line from Lake Erie to Mount Vernon. ''What we do not want to end up with is natural gas-fired plants, plus nuclear plants, plus a gas pipeline,'' said Dani Glaser of Croton-on-Hudson, a member of a civic group called Not Under My Backyard. ''And that, right now, is entirely possible. And we'll fight that with everything.'' Entergy has not filed a formal application for the gas plants with the New York State Public Service Commission, Mr. Steets said. Instead, what it did on Tuesday was announce its intention to file, setting off the start of the public hearing process. A formal filing is expected by May. Entergy wants to build eight 45-megawatt gas plants to provide a total of 360 megawatts whenever its two nuclear generators, which produce 1,000 megawatts each, are pushed to capacity. The gas plants would be housed in a single structure on a site, now a gravel parking lot, about 1,500 feet from the generators, and at a higher elevation. ''What's important is making sure that we have enough energy to power up the energy needs for now and the future,'' said Representative Sue W. Kelly, a Republican who represents the Buchanan area. She called the gas-fired plant a promising idea that needed to be studied thoroughly. Fred Zalcman, executive director of the Pace Law School Energy Project, which studies energy issues, said that the fears of a possible gas explosion at Indian Point could be dealt with during the required feasibility study, and should not be a cause for alarm. ''In general,'' he said, echoing Ms. Kelly, ''I think it's prudent to start looking at alternatives in Indian Point.'' Since the advent of electricity deregulation, Entergy, which is based in Jackson, Miss., has focused much of its efforts on acquiring nuclear power plants in the northeastern United States, including Indian Point 3 in March 2000 and the troubled Indian Point 2 reactor in September. But because of the prospect of surging energy demand in New York City and its suburbs, Entergy first floated the idea of building gas plants at Indian Point this spring. ''It's important for people to understand that safety is our primary consideration before we would go forward with this,'' Mr. Steets said. But in many people's minds, the issue of nuclear power was changed irrevocably after Sept. 11. Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, is among several elected officials and environmentalists who have urged Entergy to close Indian Point 2 because of safety concerns in an era of terrorism. To other officials, the idea of converting Indian Point 2 from nuclear to gas is more appealing. One plant that has done this is Fort St. Vrain, in Colorado, which switched to a natural-gas plant earlier this year after being decommissioned five years ago, said Michael B. Kaplowitz, a Westchester legislator involved with the issue. And there is no reason, Mr. Kaplowitz said, that public pressure could not help bring about the same result locally. ''The public clamor, I believe, will leave them no choice: to either close and go away, or convert, and I believe they will convert,'' he said.",2001-11-15T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Credit... David Guttenfelder for The New York Times The United Nations secretary general spoke with Russia’s defense minister on Monday about the threat of a meltdown after several days of shelling at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, according to the U.N. It also said it could help send in nuclear inspectors, if both sides agreed. Daily shelling at the Russian-occupied, Ukrainian-operated Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant near Enerhodar, Ukraine, has made it the first active nuclear power plant known to be at the center of fighting, and a meltdown would be devastating for both sides. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has accused Russia of “nuclear blackmail” at the site. And he reiterated that claim in his nightly address on Monday. “If now the world lacks the strength and determination to protect one nuclear plant, it means that the world loses,” he said in the address, adding, “Loses to terrorists. Gives in to nuclear blackmail.” It remains unclear who is to blame for the attacks at the plant. The Ukrainians have accused the Russians of directing strikes there to cut off energy supplies to other cities and to try to discredit the Ukrainian military in the world’s eyes. The Russians say Ukraine is doing the shelling. On Monday, António Guterres, the U.N. secretary general, spoke with Sergei K. Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, by phone about Zaporizhzhia, according to the U.N.’s website. They discussed “conditions for the safe operation” of the site, as well as a deadly explosion at the Olenivka prisoner camp in July, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a post on Telegram. The phone call came on the day that the Ukrainian company that oversees the nation’s nuclear power plants said that Russian forces had in the past week targeted a fire station outside of the plant that is responsible for extinguishing fires at the facility in the event of an emergency. That poses “a serious risk to the safe operation of the plant,” the company, Energoatom, said in a statement. “There are still risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering radioactive substances, and the risk of fire is high,” the statement added, saying that three of the radiation monitoring sensors around the plant have also been damaged by recent shelling. It was impossible to independently evaluate the assessment. Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for the U.N. secretary general’s office, said in a statement that the organization had the “logistics and security capacity” to support a visit from the International Atomic Energy Agency to the Zaporizhzhia plant, “should both Russia and Ukraine agree.” Russia has expressed support for such a visit, but Ukraine’s government has not officially endorsed it, possibly out of concern that it could somehow legitimize Russia’s occupation of the nuclear plant. In his nightly address on Monday, Mr. Zelensky acknowledged that the U.N. was involved, but did not mention a visit from I.A.E.A. inspectors. Last week, Mr. Guterres urged Ukraine and Russia to allow the international inspectors to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex and called for an immediate stop of all military activity near the plant. Though a sense of urgency has ramped up this month, concerns about safety at Zaporizhzhia have been raised since the start of the war. In March, the I.A.E.A. urged Russia and Ukraine to reach an agreement on nuclear safety and security. Russian representatives rejected an initial offer from the agency to meet at the Chernobyl nuclear site at the time, though the agency said that Moscow was in talks with Ukrainian representatives.

The pattern of settlement and types of farming that can be pieced together from Soviet maps, atlases and geographical descriptions suggests that planners picked a site for the Chernobyl nuclear station in relatively undeveloped territory near the marshy border between the Soviet Union's Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics, and yet within easy access of major urban centers. An area of sandy soils of limited productivity, the Chernobyl district is not part of the wheat belt of black soils farther south that have made the Ukraine the legendary breadbasket of the Soviet Union. Local agriculture focuses on the cultivation of rye, a hardy grain that prospers in the sandy soils, and fiber flax as well as dairy farming. Villages, typically made up of Ukrainian log cabins with thatched roofs, tend to be small, with an average population of 500 to 700 people. #3d Largest Soviet City The density of rural population gradually increases toward the south, in the direction of Kiev, which with 2.5 million people is the third largest Soviet city, after Moscow and Leningrad. The most prominent geographical feature between the Chernobyl area and the city of Kiev is the 50-mile-long Kiev Reservoir on the Dnieper River. It was formed in the late 1960's by the construction of a dam and 350-megawatt hydroelectric station on the northern outskirts of Kiev, at the town of Vyshgorod. The hydroelectric station is associated with a pumped storage installation that uses surplus electricity during the night hours to pump water into an upper reservoir, for use in generating electricity during daylight hours of peak demand. The population center most affected by the problem at the nuclear plant -and reported to have been at least partly evacuated - would be the new town of Pripyat. It was built in the 1970's on a greenfield site near the Pripyat River, 13 miles northwest of the older town of Chernobyl, within sight of the power station to house its construction and operating workers and their families. At Yanov Whistle Stop Pripyat arose on the site of the rail station of Yanov, a whistle stop on a railroad runing west from Chernigov, the largest city near the site of the nuclear accident. Chernigov, 55 miles away, has a population of 280,000. Although the Soviet press tends to be fairly open about nuclear power development, as opposed to the highly secret nuclear weapons program, available information on Pripyat still reflects official inhibitions. Some recent Soviet encyclopedias and gazetteers contain brief entries on the town, but do not mention the presence of the Chernobyl nuclear power station, which is situated just southeast of Pripyat, on the high right bank of the Pripyat River. In 1972, according to Soviet reference books, Pripyat was officially made a so-called workers settlement, the lowest rank of urban center in the Soviet Union. Two years later it was reported to have 10,000 residents, with a designed population level of 25,000 or more. Further growth was indicated in 1979, when the settlement was raised to the higher status of city directly under the jurisdiction of Kiev Province, in which it is situated. In the February 1986 issue of Soviet Life, the English-language magazine distributed by the Russians in the United States, Pripyat was portrayed as a typical planned Soviet town, with apartment blocks set among pine groves and flower beds lining its streets. Villages Presumably Cleared Three other communities reported by the Soviet Union to have been evacuated after the accident have not been identified, but are presumed to be small agricultural villages near the nuclear station. The Chernobyl station at Pripyat had four reactors of 1,000 megawatts each in operation before the accident, with a fifth scheduled to go into service this year. The first reactor generated its first electricity in 1977, followed by the three others in 1978, 1981 and 1983. With 4,000 megawatts of electrical capacity installed, the Chernobyl station accounted for one-seventh of the Soviet Union's total nuclear capacity of 28,000 megawatts at the end of last year. Nuclear power development has been receiving high priority in the Soviet Union, and the 12th five-year plan starting this year calls for the addition of 41,000 megawatts of capacity by the end of 1990. The Ukraine, as one of the leading industrial and agricultural regions of the Soviet Union with diminishing sources of fossil fuels, has been singled out by Soviet planners for nuclear power development, with five operating plants out of a Soviet total of 15. Sixth Station Being Built In addition to the Chernobyl plant, the Ukraine has three operating nuclear stations known as Rovno, South Ukraine and Zaporozhye. A fifth, known as Khmelnitsky, is scheduled to start up this year, and a sixth, the Crimean station, is under construction. The Soviet nuclear power program, aside from meeting part of the domestic demand for electricity, is also intended to supply electric power to Eastern Europe. Several Soviet nuclear plants, including Chernobyl and others in the Ukraine, are near the western frontier and send electricity to Eastern Europe over an integrated power grid. The Soviet Union's electricity exports to its allies now run about 20 billion kilowatt-hours a year. The Chernobyl station was connected to the integrated grid in 1980, and supplies power to Hungary.",1986-04-30T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world

Thousands dead or missing from the devastating earthquake and tsunami surge. Hundreds of thousands homeless. Whole villages wiped out. And now there is the threat of further harm from badly damaged nuclear reactors. The worst-case accident would be enormous releases of radioactivity. The unfolding Japanese tragedy also should prompt Americans to closely study our own plans for coping with natural disasters and with potential nuclear plant accidents to make sure they are, indeed, strong enough. We’ve already seen how poor defenses left New Orleans vulnerable to Hurricane Katrina and how industrial folly and hubris led to a devastating blowout and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. It is sobering that such calamities could so badly hurt Japan, a technologically advanced nation that puts great emphasis on disaster mitigation. Japan’s protective seawalls proved no match for the high waves that swept over them and knocked out the safety systems that were supposed to protect nearby nuclear reactors from overheating and melting down. It is much too early to understand the magnitude of what has happened. But, as of now, this four-day crisis in Japan already amounts to the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986. From early reports, it appears that the troubled reactors survived the earthquake. Control rods shut down the nuclear fission reactions that generate power. But even after shutdown, there is residual heat that needs to be drawn off by cooling water pumped through the reactor core, and that’s where the trouble came. The nuclear plant lost its main source of electric power to drive the pumps, and the tsunami knocked out the backup diesel generators that were supposed to drive the pumps in an emergency. That left only short-term battery power that is able to provide cooling water on a small scale but can’t drive the large pumps required for full-scale cooling. Early Tuesday morning, the frightening news came that Japan was facing the full meltdown of crippled reactors at a nuclear power station — with unknown and potentially catastrophic consequences. In a televised address to the nation at 11 a.m. local time, Prime Minister Naoto Kan pleaded for calm as he announced that radiation had spread from the reactors. He added that there was “a very high risk” of further leakages. With the United States poised to expand nuclear power after decades of stagnation, it will be important to reassess safety standards. Some 30 American reactors have designs similar to the crippled reactors in Japan. Various reactors in this country are situated near geologic faults, in coastal areas reachable by tsunamis or in areas potentially vulnerable to flooding. Regulators will need to evaluate how well operators would cope if they lost both primary power and backup diesel generators for an extended period. This page has endorsed nuclear power as one tool to head off global warming. We suspect that, when all the evidence is in from Japan, it will remain a valuable tool. But the public needs to know that it is a safe one.",2011-03-15T04:14:01.000+01:00,NYTIMES,editorial-opinion

Eugene P. Wilkinson, who commanded the Nautilus, the United States Navy’s first nuclear-powered submarine and the first machine to harness atomic fission for propulsion rather than weaponry, died on Thursday in Del Mar, Calif. He was 94. His family confirmed the death. As commander of the 324-foot, dirigible-shaped submarine, Admiral Wilkinson made headlines worldwide when he steered the Nautilus, propelled by its onboard reactor, out of a shipyard in Groton, Conn., into Long Island Sound on Jan. 17, 1955, and uttered his first radio message: “Under way on nuclear power.” The vessel represented a historic technological achievement; a personal triumph for Admiral Wilkinson’s mentor, Adm. Hyman G. Rickover, the founding father of the nuclear Navy; and a resounding if double-edged statement about war and peace and the future uses of nuclear power. President Dwight D. Eisenhower saw in the Nautilus the commercial potential of nuclear power, a theme of his “Atoms for Peace” initiative in the years before the first commercial nuclear power plant was built in the United States, based on technology pioneered by the Nautilus. Military analysts greeted the submarine as the vanguard of a new age in warfare, a machine previously unimagined except in the fiction of Jules Verne (whose novels “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea” and “The Mysterious Island” featured a submarine called the Nautilus). Faster and more agile than any submarine before, it was able to cruise almost indefinitely without refueling. (The half-joking rumor among the crew was that they would surface every four years to re-enlist.) It became the prototype for the Navy’s perpetually prowling fleet of strategic nuclear missile subs. Admiral Wilkinson’s career straddled the commercial and military realms of nuclear power. He went on to command the Navy’s first nuclear-powered surface ship, the cruiser Long Beach, from 1959 to 1963. At his retirement from the Navy in 1974, he was the vice admiral in command of all submarine warfare operations. From 1980 to 1985 he ran the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations , a nonprofit organization established by the nuclear power industry to improve safety standards in the aftermath of the Three Mile Island accident near Harrisburg, Pa. Admiral Wilkinson recalled the Nautilus launching as the apex of a period of unqualified optimism about atomic energy. “If you were involved in nuclear,” he told The San Diego Tribune in a 1989 interview, “you were a white shining knight.” Eugene Parks Wilkinson was born on Aug. 10, 1918, in Long Beach, Calif., and was orphaned shortly afterward, when his father, Dennis, died in a car accident and his mother, Daisy, succumbed to a sudden illness. He was raised by his grandparents Dennis and Lillian Wilkinson, who ran a small creamery. Admiral Wilkinson, who was known as Dennis to family and friends, graduated from San Diego State College with a degree in physics and chemistry and was teaching chemistry there as a graduate student when World War II broke out. After he enlisted, the Navy sent him to an officer training program and assigned him to diesel-driven submarines. He received the Silver Star for valor in the Pacific. Teaching at the Navy’s submarine school after the war, he was wavering between pursuing a Navy career and returning to his postgraduate studies when Admiral Rickover, the newly appointed head of the Navy’s nuclear power development agency, offered him a chance to do both. With a corps of other handpicked officers, he was sent to study atomic physics and nuclear reactors at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee and the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. He later served as the representative of the Bureau of Ships at Atomic Energy Commission offices in the Pittsburgh area. He is survived by three sons, Dennis, Stephen and Rod; a daughter, Marian Casazza; and four grandchildren. His wife, Janice, died in 2000. In a 2001 biography of Admiral Rickover, Francis Duncan wrote that he chose Admiral Wilkinson, a commander at the time, to skipper the Nautilus because he was “intelligent, imaginative, and free from the deadly embrace of tradition” — a reference to his not having graduated from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. The two remained friends until Admiral Rickover’s death in 1986. Crusty and temperamental, Admiral Rickover also had a mischievous sense of fun, which Admiral Wilkinson recalled in an article for The Saturday Evening Post in 1955. The Nautilus was on its maiden voyage, he wrote, when Admiral Rickover took a turn at the controls. After completing a scheduled test maneuver, he then ad-libbed orders for a nonsensical, if not dangerous, move: “Take her down and put her on the bottom,” he said. “All ahead full.” “This left me in a rather embarrassing situation,” Admiral Wilkinson wrote, “since I had to countermand all the admiral’s orders immediately.”",2013-07-16T03:52:13.000+02:00,NYTIMES,national-u.s.
a20a7925-2a14-417e-a630-782c6619e8fe,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/03/world/asia/japanese-utility-to-seek-to-restart-two-nuclear-reactors.html,Fukushima Plant Operator Intends to Restart Reactors Elsewhere,"TOKYO — The operator of the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant said Tuesday that it would ask regulators to allow it to restart two reactors at a separate site in eastern Japan, even as problems with the company’s cleanup in Fukushima continue to multiply . The request by the operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company , is expected to be among a flurry of such appeals from utilities seeking to restart reactors now that the government has approved tougher safety guidelines . The government hopes the regulations will help it overcome deep public concerns about nuclear power and government oversight, allowing it to get additional plants back online more than two years after the Fukushima crisis . The requests are expected to revive a debate in Japan about the future of nuclear power that has been relatively quiet for months as regulators have worked on the new rules. Since the disaster at the Fukushima plant in 2011, only two reactors have been allowed to resume operations in an effort to head off electricity shortages, but the government and supporters of nuclear power say it is critical to the economy that Japan return to relatively cheap nuclear power rather than relying on costly natural gas and coal imports . The Tokyo Electric Power Company, known as Tepco, said it would soon apply to restart two of the seven reactors at its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant , the world’s biggest nuclear power station by capacity. That plant, about 140 miles northeast of Tokyo, was not affected by the earthquake and tsunami that wreaked havoc at Fukushima Daiichi, but Kashiwazaki-Kariwa does sit atop fault lines and was damaged in a 2007 quake caused by another fault. The company says it needs to get the reactors back online to stem the losses it has suffered since the reactor meltdowns at Fukushima. It is unclear if Tepco will face more scrutiny than other utilities; some experts have warned that Tepco is overwhelmed by the difficult cleanup at Fukushima. Recent leaks of contaminated water revealed major flaws in the company’s storage of the tons of radioactive water that is generated daily as groundwater flows into damaged reactor buildings, adding to a string of mishaps. Fresh trouble on Tuesday underscored the precarious cleanup efforts. A small fire broke out in a waste pile near plant incinerators, the company said. Firefighters extinguished the flames an hour later, and Tepco said there were no injuries and no increase in radiation levels, but the cause of the fire, which damaged an area of about 45 square feet, was under investigation. Tepco’s president, Naomi Hirose, said restarting the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa reactors would not divert attention from its cleanup at Fukushima. “At Kashiwazaki-Kariwa,” he said, “we have incorporated all the safety measures we can.” Japan’s utilities have been encouraged by the pro-nuclear stance of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , who has largely reversed government policy conceived under a more liberal government that had hoped to phase out the nuclear power program. Mr. Abe appears to be counting on his ability to convince the Japanese that they will now be safe because the government has replaced its previous nuclear regulatory agency — which had been heavily criticized for its close links to the power industry — with a more independent one. The new regulators devised the latest safety standards. But local communities will also have a say in signing off on restarts, and the governor of Niigata Prefecture, where Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is located, remains opposed , especially until Tepco reaches a fuller understanding of the safety lapses that led to the Fukushima disaster. “Trying to push through the restarts now shows they’ve learned nothing from what happened in Fukushima,” Hirohiko Izumida, the governor, told the Nikkei business daily on Monday. “There must be a full accounting of why there was so much damage.” The seismic faults running underneath the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa site could be a hurdle in winning local approval. Tepco has not said when it might apply to restart the plant’s other five reactors.Tepco says the faults have not been active for at least 120,000 years, and that it has made the necessary fortifications at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant to withstand quakes. Tepco also says its finances have been crippled by the compensation it is paying to the victims of the Fukushima disaster, which at one point had displaced more than 100,000 people. The power company was effectively nationalized last year to help pay for the mounting claims. Tepco’s bottom line has also been damaged by the costs of the cleanup, as well as by expensive imports of fuel for the conventional power stations that now provide most of the power to the Tokyo region. The company runs another nuclear power station near the Fukushima Daiichi plant that was also damaged in the 2011 quake and tsunami. The company is not applying to restart those reactors, at least for now.",2013-07-03T00:20:13.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Consider: The potential power shortage Connecticut faced last summer will be shared this year by all of New England. Last year three out of four Connecticut plants were shut down, but at least the Connecticut Yankee nuclear power plant at Haddam Neck operated through July. Then last fall, its operator, Northeast Utilities, closed the Connecticut Yankee permanently after officials determined it made no economic sense to continue running the unit. Now, with all four of the state's nuclear plans shut down, the region as well as the state faces possible power shortages. The three Millstone nuclear units have been shut down since March of 1996, two months after they were placed on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's watch list of unsafe nuclear plants. Northeast Utilities is working hard to reopen one of its Millstone units, but does not expect to do so until the end of the year at the earliest. Elsewhere in New England, the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant, which was placed on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's watch list six months ago, is shut down. ''Five of the New England states' eight nuclear power plants are now out of operation,'' said William P. Sheperdson, spokesman for the New England Power Pool, which regulates the region's distribution of power. The five closed nuclear plants were capable of providing about 4,000 megawatts of electricity, said Myra Humphries, spokeswoman for Northeast Utilities, about enough to supply 1.2 million homes. The nuclear-powered wattage now on hold is just shy of one-fifth of the expected peak demand of 21,400 megawatts that the power pool expects the New England states to need this summer, and more than two-thirds of Connecticut's expected peak demand of 5,800 megawatts, according to Ms. Humphries. The power pool has become so concerned about potential power shortages that it requested that Northeast Utilities schedule maintenance weeks early for its nuclear plant at Seabrook, N.H. -- in May instead of July, Mr. Sheperdson said. The plant, shut down yesterday, will be closed for five weeks. If all goes as scheduled, it will be producing power again in mid-June, Ms. Humphries said. ''The first time people get really hot weather in May or June, it's a relief, especially after the kind of cool spring we've had,'' Mr. Sheperdson said. ''They go out to buy air conditioners, or put them in,'' but tend not to turn them on, he said. It's the second and third occasions when temperatures soar -- especially if they do so for long periods -- that people begin running the cooling apparatus at high. That is why the power pool sought an earlier maintenance plan for Seabrook, to get things in place before summer heat really sets in. If Connecticut gets through this summer without power shortages, one major reason could be equipment that Northeast Utilities personnel spent much of the winter scrambling to install on major transmission lines that cross the state lines from New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Capacitors, electrical equipment attached to major utility poles, will significantly increase the voltage of electricity the state will be able to import, increasing voltage capacity from 2,100 megawatts of power last summer to 2,520 megawatts this year, according to Ms. Humphries. Northeast Utilities is also keeping nonnuclear plants in reserve, plants that it reactivated last year. These include Middletown 1, Norwalk Harbor 10 and four gas turbine jet engines in Milford that themselves are capable of producing 160 megawatts of power. The United Illuminating Company, which provides electricity to 17 cities and towns including Bridgeport and New Haven, last year also reactivated its Bridgeport Harbor Unit 1, said Fran Mayko, a spokeswoman. ''We're running the plant at minimum power in case it is needed,'' she explained. Even the Navy submarine base in Groton was ready last year in case its help was necessary and the base intends to stand by again this year, said Chief Petty Officer William Polson, a base spokesman. Last year, the Navy Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme, Calif., flew in 21 generators capable of producing 24 megawatts of electricity. ''Not only would it have made us self-sufficient in case of a problem, it would have helped the community, too,'' Chief Polson said. The generators were never needed, but this year, the base has retained eight generators capable of producing 13.5 megawatts of power. Ms. Mayko said that United Illuminating gave 350 commercial and industrial customers pagers last year in order to notify them in the event that a voltage reduction was about to occur. The company never had to call. Utilities have also identified customers whose power is not to be interrupted -- hospitals, sewage treatment plants and downtown urban areas among them. Both United and Northeast have granted rate reductions to customers who are willing to have their power interrupted in case a heat wave forces cutbacks, the companies said. In a worst-case scenario, the utilities would resort to rolling blackouts, cutting electricity to neighborhoods during the day on a rotating basis for one or two hours at a time. But the utilities hope such steps will not be necessary. ''We're cautiously optimistic that, if everything works well, we'll be in reasonably good shape during a heat wave,'' Ms. Humphries said. Because potential power problems face the entire region, the New England Power Pool has put in place a series of warnings to alert the public that conservation is needed, especially if the weather is warm. It also has arranged with other regional power pools, in New York State and Canada, to purchase more electricity if it is needed. Potential power shortages aren't unheard-of in New England, said Mr. Sheperdson. He pointed to the experience in 1984, when the New England economy was beginning to boom and several of the region's power plants -- including Seabrook and Millstone 3 -- were not yet completed. ''New England managed then, and it might well make it through the summer without much of a problem,'' Mr. Sheperdson said. Still, the best ally the region could have is another cool summer, like last year's. ''My gut feeling? It isn't likely that we'll get two such cool summers in a row,'' said Ms. Mayko, a sentiment that was echoed by other utility employees.",1997-05-11T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

The staff reductions were expected to be made first through early retirements and are not necessarily the end of the changes, Westinghouse said in a statement. ''We will continue to take those steps necessary to keep costs competitive with global competition,'' it said, without elaborating. The nuclear power business has suffered because of the high cost of constructing plants; long, safety-related delays in construction, and sluggish growth in electricity use. Westinghouse, the industry leader, also was dealt a crippling blow by the Soviet Union's Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster earlier this year.

He was 95. Mr. Starr was still coming to work six days a week until the day before his death, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit utility consortium in Palo Alto, Calif., which he founded in 1972. Both Dr. Starr’s advocacy and his design work were important in the early years of nuclear power. “Chauncey Starr was a visionary pioneer in the field of nuclear energy and helped encourage the development of the domestic nuclear power industry,” Dale Klein, the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said on Wednesday. “Likewise, he was a leader in reactor safety, a seminal thinker in the field of risk analysis, and one of the pre-eminent engineer-scientists of our time.” Mr. Starr was the dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles, from 1966 to 1973; there, he directed early work on risk analysis and social benefits. He was a very early exponent of the idea that society’s perception of risk was skewed. At a meeting of the National Academy of Engineering in 1969, commenting on why only 40 percent of car passengers used lap belts and hardly any used shoulder belts (which were then separate pieces of hardware), he said that people would accept risks if they thought the risks were more than balanced by convenience or other benefits. Thus, he said, people would accept “voluntary” risks, from smoking or sports, that were 1,000 times as great as the risk they would allow to be imposed on them from the generation of electricity. “As one would expect, we are loath to let others do unto us what we happily do to ourselves,” he said. Earning an electrical engineering degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1932 and a Ph.D. in physics three years later, Dr. Starr became a research fellow at Harvard University and then worked on the Manhattan Project, the World War II effort to develop atomic weapons. By 1953, as the president of the atomic research division of North American Aviation, he presented a model of an eight-megawatt nuclear power reactor that he said could be built for $10 million. It used liquid metal to transfer the heat produced in the reactor for production of steam and electricity. It was not the design ultimately chosen by the American industry. Three years later, observing that generating capacity was doubling every 10 years in this country, he predicted that nuclear power might eventually dominate the energy field. “In about 50 years, it might be conceivably most desirable if the major portions of our electricity and heat for cities was supplied by central station nuclear power plants,” he said. “This would preserve our fossil fuel resources for mobile power (automobiles, trains, small ships and airplanes) and raw material for the chemical industry.” In fact, reactors today provide 20 percent of the nation’s electricity, and 10 percent of its energy over all. Dr. Starr was also an advocate of electrification. In the 1980s and 1990s, he would argue at energy conferences that electrification had planetwide potential. Cooking dinner over an open fire, as in the third world, wastes 98 percent of the energy used. If the same wood were burned in a boiler to make electricity, he said, it might cook 15 dinners. Dr. Starr wrote more than 400 technical and scientific articles. He had also served as vice president of the National Academy of Engineering and was a founder and past president of the American Nuclear Society. He is survived by his wife of 69 years, Doris; a daughter, Ariel Wooley of Los Altos, Calif.; a son, Ross, of San Diego; and five grandchildren. A celebration to honor Mr. Starr, who turned 95 on Saturday, was held at the Electric Power Research Institute the day before he died; 200 colleagues attended.",2007-04-19T06:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,obituaries

The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, is set to visit the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southern Ukraine on Wednesday.

Mr. Grossi said one purpose was to talk to management and consolidate the permanent presence of I.A.E.A. inspectors who first arrived there last September. Russia’s state-owned nuclear company, Rosatom, has taken over the management of the plant. Rosatom is trying to force plant operatives and engineers to sign contracts with it rather than with Ukraine’s state nuclear company. Mr. Grossi said he did not know whether Rosatom intended to connect the plant to Russia’s grid. He also said it was imperative that the nuclear power plant had enough water for its cooling systems. The Ukrainian authorities have said in recent weeks that Russian forces, who control a dam downstream from the plant on the Dnipro River, were allowing the water level to fall in the reservoir that feeds the nuclear facility. What is the situation at the plant? Recent reports, including from some Ukrainian officials, suggest that Ukraine could launch a counteroffensive in the south of the country in the coming weeks. That could mean an escalation of fighting in the region of the nuclear plant. Mr. Grossi did not comment on the reports but said that inspectors at the plant had reported “increased military activity” in the area. “There is a quite obvious increase in the number of troops on both sides and military equipment,” he said. “Our teams are also observing and hearing and seeing more military activity, including detonations, regular, almost permanent.” He said that the increased activity “most definitely” increased the risk at the plant. Is the I.A.E.A. still seeking to establish a safety zone around the plant? Ukrainian officials have said that Russia effectively blocked the plan to establish a safety and security zone around the plant because it would almost certainly involve their withdrawal. Mr. Grossi said that he would “never give up” on the plan and that he was consulting with all sides. “We are refocusing the effort in the sense that we are talking less about a zone and more about establishing protection, which means that we are trying to agree on a certain number of principles and commitments that both sides will have to agree with,” he said. Does he have enough international backing? Mr. Grossi warned the I.A.E.A.’s board of governors recently against complacency, urging the members to be mindful of the perils facing the plant. Its luck, he said, could run out. He said on Tuesday that he was getting “closer and closer” to achieving the right level of international backing and an agreement on protecting the plant. “There have been moments where some have had questions, but I see now a growing, very sustained trend in favor of protecting the plant,” he said. He singled out the European Union and China as being clear about this. “Weaponizing a nuclear power plant, targeting a nuclear power plant, sabotaging a nuclear power plant is a terrible idea,” he said.

The plan also includes about 20 billion Canadian dollars for renewable energy projects and 6 billion Canadian dollars ($5.3 billion) for power conservation. ''We have had a very bad financial history with nuclear power,'' the province's energy minister, Dwight Duncan, said in an interview after announcing the plan, which will take about 20 years to complete. ''The challenge now is that we must manage these projects properly and share the risk with potential suppliers.'' Some reactor makers saw the plan as a major step toward revitalizing their industry in North America. A decade has passed since the last new reactor was switched on. ''This is extremely important for the nuclear industry,'' said Patrick Lamarre, the chief executive of SNC-Lavalin Nuclear. ''This is something we've been waiting for for many years.'' Vaughan Gilbert, a spokesman for Westinghouse Nuclear, which is based in Monroeville, Pa., and owned by BNFL of Britain, said, ''We've been gearing up for this even though the market for new plants in North America had dried up.'' If completed as envisioned, the plan will maintain the current level of nuclear-generated power, which provides about half of Ontario's electricity. The other half is provided mainly by hydro-electric dams and coal. Ontario already encounters electrical shortages, particularly during hot summer days. Cost overruns and time delays that occurred during previous attempts to refurbish reactors have made the government shy about pursuing that route again. As a result, 3 of Ontario's 19 reactors are not in use. A Conservative government that preceded Mr. Duncan and the Liberals restructured the province's government-owned electrical system as a prelude to privatization. But a variety of problems, including a political scandal tied to utility executives' salaries, meant that the province never saw a major influx of privately owned power-generating companies. Those issues recently forced Mr. Duncan to back away from a campaign pledge to close by 2009 the coal-fired generating stations. Exactly how many reactors the province will build is unclear. The project will initially involve at least two units at a cost of about 2 billion Canadian dollars each. But that number is expected to rise after an analysis by the government-owned Ontario Power Generation on the feasibility and cost effectiveness of renewing current stations. In the past, Ontario always bought reactors from Atomic Energy of Canada, or A.E.C.L., which is owned by the Canadian government and based in Mississauga, Ontario. That may not be the case this time. ''Our preference is to use Canadian technology,'' Mr. Duncan said. ''But the important thing is to get the right deal.'' Westinghouse has already expressed interest in bidding, and Susan Hess, the manager of strategic marketing for Areva NP -- which is owned by Areva of France and Siemens of Germany -- said her company was interested in both building and refitting plants. In anticipation of making a bid, A.E.C.L. has created a joint venture with SNC-Lavalin Nuclear and the Canadian branches of General Electric, Babcock and Wilcox and Hitachi. Mr. Lamarre said the group would propose to build the reactors at a fixed price and with penalties for late delivery. Mark Winfield, the director of environmental governance at the Pembina Institute for Appropriate Development, predicted that the province would only experience further financial grief by recommitting to nuclear generation. ''It's a very strange approach and a very high-risk one as well,'' he said. Mr. Winfield said he was skeptical that nuclear power generation would succeed financially this time around, and said the government was underestimating the full potential of energy conservation.",2006-06-14T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-financial-desk

Inspectors Seek Access","Image The Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex, across the Dnipro River from Nikopol, in July. Credit... David Guttenfelder for The New York Times KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s largest nuclear plant was reconnected to the national power grid on Friday afternoon, but its time offline renewed concerns about the safe operation of the plant, as negotiations to allow U.N. inspectors to visit the site gathered momentum. Ukrainian engineers were able to restore damaged external power lines after repeated shelling on Thursday, ensuring the facility was able to meet its own power needs and continue to operate safely, according to Ukrainian and international officials, but efforts to reconnect it to the grid took longer. With fires raging around the plant, new shelling in and around the facility on a near daily basis and an exhausted and stressed team of Ukrainian engineers tasked with keeping the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant running safely, however, calls for international intervention grew louder. Negotiations with Ukraine and Russia to allow safety experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit and inspect the plant appeared to be making progress, as U.N. officials indicated they expected an agreement soon. “We are in active consultations for an imminent I.A.E.A. mission,” a spokesman for the agency said. The stakes are high. “Nowhere in the history of this world has a nuclear power plant become a part of a combat zone, so this really has to stop immediately,” Bonnie Denise Jenkins, the State Department’s under secretary for arms control and international security, told reporters in Brussels on Thursday. Russian actions, she said, “have created a serious risk of a nuclear incident — a dangerous radiation release — that could threaten not only the people and environment of Ukraine, but also affect neighboring countries and the entire international community.” One of the main sticking points in the efforts to bring in nuclear inspectors has been the route they would take to the plant, which is on the Dnipro River in southern Ukraine. The Ukrainians have insisted that the I.A.E.A. mission originate from territory they control. That would likely mean that the inspectors would have to pass through front line positions where shelling is frequent, via a crossing point now mainly used by civilians fleeing the fighting and nuclear danger in the Russian-occupied territory. Any deal would likely require that a cease-fire along the route. The head of the I.A.E.A., Rafael M. Grossi, has expressed extreme urgency in seeking access for his team of inspectors, which he intends to lead himself. On Thursday, he predicted the inspectors would gain access “in the next few days.” Though the immediate threat at the plant appeared to have been averted, its disconnection from the national grid on Thursday and part of Friday caused widespread power outages across southern Ukraine, adding to the misery wrought by the war. The Zaporizhzhia regional government said that as of Friday morning, energy supplies were “partially restored” from other sources. The plant was reconnected to the Ukrainian grid at 2:04 p.m. on Friday, according to Ukraine’s nuclear energy agency, Energoatom. Many of the towns and cities in southern Ukraine fell in the first days of the war and were spared the widespread destruction witnessed in the east. But if the nuclear plant were to go offline again, the power for hundreds of thousands living in occupied territories could be compromised. “The south of Ukraine — the occupied areas — is already in a state of humanitarian disaster,” Mr. Zelensky said. “In addition to all the evil that the occupiers brought there, electricity, water and sewage were cut off.” Andrew Higgins and Farnaz Fassihi contributed reporting.",2022-08-26T23:26:42.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

South Korea’s nuclear power industry has been plagued by a series of forced shutdowns, corruption scandals and mechanical failures in recent years, undermining public confidence in atomic energy even as the country’s dependence on it for electricity is expected to grow. An anonymous whistle-blower led government investigators to uncover the latest problem, in which control cables that had failed to pass a safety test were given fake certificates and supplied to four reactors, the country’s Nuclear Safety and Security Commission said Tuesday. The control cable is used to send electronic signals to a reactor’s control system in the event of an accident. The commission halted operations at two reactors on Tuesday so the problematic cables could be replaced. The planned start-up of two other reactors — one under a routine maintenance shutdown and the other a newly built reactor waiting for operational approval — will be delayed for the same reason. South Korea has 23 reactors, and Tuesday’s decision means that 10 reactors are temporarily off line for safety concerns, maintenance and other reasons, raising the risk of power shortages in the summer, when electricity consumption peaks. The two reactors shut down on Tuesday are on the southeastern coast of South Korea, and each has a capacity of 1,000 megawatts. The recurring scandals have damaged the reputation of South Korea’s nuclear power industry, which supplies one-third of the country’s electricity needs and aspires to become a global exporter of reactors. Despite increasing public concern, however, the government remained determined to push ahead with its aggressive nuclear power program; the country plans to add 16 more reactors by 2030. Last year, South Korea was forced to shut down two reactors when it was revealed that thousands of substandard parts had been supplied with fake warranties for over 10 years. The country resorted to various power-saving measures to avoid blackouts. Several nuclear power engineers and parts suppliers were later jailed for involvement in the scandal.",2013-05-28T09:00:34.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Video Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said two United Nations experts would remain at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to provide independent assessments of its safety. Credit Credit... Leonhard Foeger/Reuters ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine — The gravest risk to the embattled Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is physical damage to equipment from shelling that could lead to a release of radiation, the director of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog agency said Friday after a visit to the site. Other risks abound, Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters in Vienna, a day after inspecting the nuclear station in southern Ukraine. The plant has been repeatedly hit by artillery. Loss of external power to cool reactor cores and stress on the operating staff also pose dangers, he said. “It is obvious there is a lot of fighting in general in this part of Ukraine,” Mr. Grossi said. “The military activity and operations are increasing in that part of the country, and this worries me a lot.” Mr. Grossi said two United Nations experts would remain at the plant to independently assess its safety going forward. Most of the damage from the war at the sprawling station, which is the largest nuclear plant in Europe, occurred during shelling in August, Mr. Grossi said, unless one considers the destruction from the battle in March when the Russian Army captured the site. This year the Zaporizhzhia plant, nestled in a gentle valley of farm fields in a once sleepy and provincial corner of Ukraine that is now a site of raging battles along a front line, became the first active nuclear plant to be caught in a combat zone in the history of civilian nuclear power. Over all, not one of what the nuclear monitoring agency calls the seven pillars of nuclear safety, which include physical integrity, reliable external power and availability of spare parts, remains intact, Mr. Grossi said. The plant has six reactors and before the war provided 30 percent of Ukraine’s electricity. But on some points the agency’s initial assessment was more optimistic than the picture painted by Ukrainian officials, who had said that engineers and other employees had been subjected to harsh interrogation and even torture, raising stress levels when they returned to work in reactor control rooms and in other critical jobs. Mr. Grossi said that he had spoken with the Ukrainian employees and that they had found a way to cooperate — what he called “cohabitation” — with the Russian soldiers and nuclear experts also at the site. “The plant continues to operate, and there is a professional modus vivendi, if I can put it that way,” he said. Before the visit, Ukrainian officials had said the agency should discount anything employees at the plant said, arguing they are essentially hostages. Mr. Grossi said the Ukrainian and Russian nuclear engineers had managed to “cope” in operating the site and that he was less worried about disruptions in regulatory oversight and supplies of spare parts, while these problems also loomed as risks. He spoke after he and a team of inspectors crossed a front line in Russia’s war in Ukraine to conduct an inspection. Their mission was delayed by artillery strikes on their planned route, part of a swirl of chaotic violence in and around the station. Mr. Grossi said his assessment was bound to disappoint both sides for declining to place blame on one or another army for the shells hitting the plant. “I don’t want to pretend what we are doing will end this terrible war or give back this plant to Ukraine,” he said. The mission was limited to gauging nuclear safety, something he said the two-man team remaining at the site would do. “Now, when there is an allegation that something has happened at the plant, you can turn to us,” he said, rather than weighing the conflicting claims of Russia and Ukraine. “That’s the difference.” He said Russian soldiers had not blocked access to areas of the site he asked to visit. Asked to compare the potential fallout from a radiation release at Zaporizhzhia with the fire and meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in 1986, which spread radiation around Europe in the world’s worst civilian nuclear accident, Mr. Grossi said designs of the two power stations were not comparable. Zaporizhzhia’s reactors have containment vessels to limit radiation release. But he said disruptions in external power to cool reactor cores could lead to a meltdown. “It could be a big thing or a small thing, depending on the damage” from the fighting, he said.",2022-09-03T03:08:07.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Nuclear power may be making a comeback, but long-standing problems with the technology still could lead to canceled orders and renewed public opposition. One problem is what to do with the highly dangerous waste produced by reactors. Currently waste is stored above ground in pools of water or in vast dry casks, but neither of those methods is regarded as adequate over the long term. Finland may be the first country to use a different method: burying the waste deep underground in clay and stable rock. You can see some images from the proposed Finnish site, Onkalo, in a slide show that I have narrated as part of a broader look at the challenges facing the industry in Friday’s New York Times. Another recurring problem is the high up-front price tag of nuclear technology compared with other sources of energy. Utilities were already canceling nuclear power plants before the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. The reason? Huge cost overruns. Governments are now putting low-carbon technologies like nuclear power back on the agenda. But nuclear’s difficult history with financing could be repeating itself, as the first two reactors that were meant to lead a comeback have been delayed and are running over-budget . And even if stars do align for nuclear, it still could take some time for it to play a significant role in lowering greenhouse gas levels, according to Paul L. Joskow, a professor or economics and management at M.I.T. and the president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation , a philanthropic organization supporting science and technology. In 2003, Mr. Joskow co-wrote an influential report on the future of nuclear power. “If nuclear is going to be a large wedge in the overall portfolio of technologies cutting greenhouse gases, then it’s going to be a post-2025 wedge,” Mr. Joskow said in a telephone interview last week. “In the near term, we are going to be using more energy efficiency measures, renewable sources and even cleaner burning natural gas to meet our climate goals,” he said.",2009-05-29T14:08:24.000+02:00,NYTIMES,science

Watkins, pledged today to do ''everything in my power'' to prevent the dismantling of the Shoreham nuclear power plant. The Secretary of Energy, James D. Watkins, pledged today to do ''everything in my power'' to prevent the dismantling of the Shoreham nuclear power plant. ''If activists can prevent things from being built,'' he said, ''I can prevent things from being shut down when it's stupid.'' He added that ''there is no way I will give up on that battle'' at a time when energy needs are growing and the nuclear power industry is stagnant. Mr. Watkins said he was not yet prepared to detail how he would fight for the $5.5 billion plant, which the Long Island Lighting Company, its financially strapped owner, plans to sell to New York State for $1 in exchange for a decade of rate increases. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, under pressure from Long Islanders fearful about how safe Shoreham is, has promised to close the plant permanently after the state takeover. May Have Plant Preserved Brad Johnson, Mr. Cuomo's representative here, said that ''the issue is moot.'' ''Ironic that with so many mismanaged, hazardous D.O.E. defense facilities he feels he has standing to give us instructions on nuclear plants,'' Mr. Johnson said of Mr. Watkins. Mr. Watkins said that one strategy to head off the closing of Shoreham would involve challenges to the Lilco-New York accord and to the planned transfer to the state of the plant's license to operate at full power, granted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission last week. ''There's a lot of steps in the agreement that I don't think meet the criteria for a responsible shift in licensing for an operating plant and shutdown and transfer of radioactive material,'' Mr. Watkins said. The 'Tragedy' of Dismantlement Another avenue, he suggested, would be to appeal to Lilco stockholders before their final vote on the agreement in June. Mr. Watkins said he thought it was still possible that ''the shareholders would find that somehow it's not going to be in their best interest to go through the tragedy of a dismantlement process where I'm going to be in there fighting every inch of the way.'' Should he fail to get Shoreham into operation, the Secretary said that ''as a minimum fallback position'' he would try to have the plant preserved for future use. Mr. Watkins, a retired Navy admiral who was sworn in as head of the Energy Department last month, made his comments at his office today. During his tenure, he said, he planned to make nuclear power ''a key element of our future national energy strategy.'' To accomplish that, he added, will require a sweeping reorganization of the department and of its relationships with its contractors, establishing ''new standards of accountability so that the American people know we know how to manage things.'' Citing growing public awareness of the problems of global warming, acid rain and air pollution resulting from burning fossil fuels, he said, ''I believe we're at the threshold of a turnaround in national attitudes toward nuclear power.'' Opposition to nuclear energy, he asserted, has come about largely because of ''years of educational neglect in our country on things scientific, engineering, mathematics.''",1989-04-28T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Ms. Merkel made the decision nearly a year ago after a devastating earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011, caused a meltdown at a nuclear plant in Fukushima, Japan. The accident heightened anxieties about nuclear safety around the world, and set off new soul-searching about the wisdom of relying on nuclear power. Weeks after the tsunami, Ms. Merkel’s government had already taken the nation’s oldest eight reactors off line; it decided in June that the remaining nine would follow over the next 11 years. But members of the opposition and environmental organizations say the government has not moved quickly enough to meet Germany’s target of drawing 35 percent of its energy from renewable sources. Last year, the total was 20 percent. The critics directed much of their fire at the nation’s distribution grid, which they said was incapable of transporting enough renewable energy from wind farms in the north to the industrial heartland in the south. They doubted the problems with the grid could be addressed by 2022. “After deciding to exit nuclear energy, it seems as if Ms. Merkel’s coalition stopped its work,” said Sigmar Gabriel, a former environment minister and the leader of the opposition Social Democrats. “There is great danger that this project will fail, with devastating economic and social consequences.” Ms. Merkel conceded in her weekly podcast that, “of course, we need a lot of new investment” for the plan to be carried out. But she insisted that her decision was the right choice. Legislation to expand the energy grid will be given “absolute priority” and passed in June, she said. But even German business groups, normally allies of the chancellor, say more needs to be done. “For the energy transformation to succeed, a lot more needs to happen,” said Markus Kerber, the head of the Association of German Industry. He stressed that a critical factor would be integrating the new power sources, whether wind or solar, into the existing network. Germany also has support from its southern neighbor Austria, which voted against pursuing atomic energy in 1974 and has been a vocal opponent ever since. Werner Faymann, the Austrian chancellor, said in an interview published on Monday that he expected to see a push beginning this year in at least six European Union countries to phase out nuclear energy. “The goal is a Europe-wide exit from nuclear energy,” Mr. Faymann told the newspaper Österreich. “I expect the petition drive will start in at least six EU countries in autumn.” But not all European Union countries are as eager to end their reliance on nuclear power as Germany is. Britain and France, as well as new members like Poland and the Czech Republic, remain committed to nuclear power as energy prices rise. So far, the switch from nuclear to renewable energy has widespread support among the German public. In a recent survey by the Wahlen research group for the public broadcaster ZDF, 76 percent of Germans said they supported the move, with the majority saying the tempo was either “just right” or “too slow.” The survey questioned about 1,250 Germans and has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.",2012-03-12T22:24:50.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-europe

In North Korea's first public reaction to reports last week of the clandestine experiment four years ago, Han Song Ryol, deputy chief of North Korea's mission to the United Nations, lambasted the United States. But he did not specifically rule out attending a new round of regional talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program. [South Korea acknowledged Thursday that it had conducted plutonium-based nuclear research in the early 1980's, Agence France-Presse reported. A government official cited a recent visit by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to a South Korean government-run nuclear research center as a reason for revealing the previously undisclosed research.] ''We view South Korea's uranium enrichment program in the context of an arms race in northeast Asia,'' Mr. Han told the Yonhap news agency of South Korea. ''It has become difficult to prevent expansion of a nuclear arms race because of South Korea's test.'' Last week, South Korea admitted publicly that in 2000 government scientists had enriched tiny amounts of uranium in what it called an ''academic'' exercise. On Wednesday, South Korea said it should have reported the uranium enrichment experiment to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency. ''We should have reported that uranium was used during this experiment,'' a senior South Korean Foreign Ministry official told reporters at a briefing in Seoul. South Korea has said that the uranium was enriched to only 10 percent. Last weekend, I.A.E.A. inspectors took a .10 gram sample to Vienna for testing to determine if the enrichment approached bomb-grade levels, or over 85 percent. South Korea has one of the world's largest nuclear power industries. Nineteen nuclear power plants supply 40 percent of the nation's electricity. It is also seeking to build nuclear power plants in China. Under a 1994 nuclear disarmament accord, South Korea was helping to build North Korea's first two commercially viable nuclear power plants when work was suspended last year as a result of North Korea's violation of the accord. Two years ago, American officials say, North Korea admitted that it was secretly enriching uranium. In January 2003, it expelled I.A.E.A. inspectors and said it started to process stored fuel rods for nuclear weapons material. Since then, it has claimed to have produced ''a nuclear deterrent,'' North Korea's ambiguous phrase for a nuclear weapons arsenal. After the American-led invasion of Iraq last year, Kim Jong Il, North Korea's leader, said the United States would not have attacked Iraq if it had had nuclear weapons. Since then, China and the United States have lead a regional effort to try to persuade North Korea to give up its weapons, most likely in return for economic aid and security guarantees. Although China has set a Sept. 22 date for the start of the fourth round of talks, North Korea has not committed to attending. In New York, Ambassador Han called Washington ''worthless'' as a negotiations partner and said that American policy toward North Korea made it ''no longer worth meeting.'' But these are phrases that have been used in the periods before talks.",2004-09-09T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,washington

Kim Kye Gwan, the North's chief negotiator in the six-nation disarmament talks, which began a recess on Sunday, made no mention of the other four nations in the negotiations and suggested no further flexibility on his part. North Korea's ''stand on the nuclear issue is very clear,'' the New China News Agency quoted him as saying Tuesday in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. ''Now it's up to the U.S. to change its policy.'' His remarks suggested that three days of reflection and consultation had only hardened North Korea's stance. A standoff over North Korea's demand that it be allowed to use nuclear power for peaceful means prevented negotiators from reaching agreement on a statement of principles, which was the goal of the talks. After 13 days of discussions, negotiators from the United States, North Korea, Russia, Japan, South Korea and China adjourned on Sunday and agreed to meet again the week of Aug. 29. In Washington, Christopher R. Hill, the chief American negotiator in the talks, insisted that the American position had not changed, either. The United States, he said, cannot accept the idea that North Korea could have a peaceful nuclear program. He said North Korea took a research reactor allowed under an agreement with the Clinton administration in 1994, and then ejected international inspectors and ''proudly proclaimed it was making bombs from this research reactor. So there's a bit of a problem here.'' Still, he tried to play down the disagreement, saying, ''I would not assume that every difference that emerged at the very end of the talks represents a serious difference or a deal-breaker type difference.'' Mr. Hill, speaking to reporters on Tuesday, added that the United States might have more direct discussions with North Korea before the talks formally resume. During Mr. Bush's first term, the United States refused to hold direct discussions with North Korea outside the context of the six-nation talks. But even with the new flexibility, Mr. Hill acknowledged that he was not sure whether the talks would eventually succeed. The United States finds itself facing the same predicament with North Korea and Iran. Both countries have indicated a possible willingness to abandon any plans for a nuclear weapons program -- but also insist they must have civilian nuclear power plants. Iran began reprocessing uranium on Monday, saying it was intended for civilian use. Last week, the United States endorsed a European proposal that acknowledged Iran's right to pursue a peaceful nuclear power program, under supervision. But it continues to oppose North Korea's nuclear-power ambitions. President Bush explained the difference on Tuesday, offering unusual implicit praise of Iran, which he once labeled as a member of ''the axis of evil.'' ''The Iranians have been, we hope, straightforward in their willingness to accept this kind of international cooperation,'' Mr. Bush said speaking to reporters at his ranch in Crawford, Tex. ''North Korea is a different story. North Korea didn't tell the truth when it came to their enrichment program.'' In fact, Iran has admitted deceiving inspectors about its nuclear activities for 17 years. But administration officials say the two negotiations simply require different approaches.",2005-08-10T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,washington

A crowd of protesters shouted at him as he arrived on Monday at the government press center to make the announcement. “It’s a debate that traditionally makes strong political waves in Germany, that a lot of emotion is attached to,” Mr. Habeck said. “It has occupied the republic for a long time and is now about to occupy the republic again. My task in this situation is to get clear of it. We have to make the right decision as a government and I have to make the right decision as the minister responsible for supply security in Germany.” For weeks, Mr. Habeck and Chancellor Olaf Scholz resisted the push to keep nuclear plants on line, but finally agreed they would make their final decision based on the stress tests. If the results showed scenarios where nuclear power would help ease the crisis, they agreed to keep the plants on past the shutdown date. On Monday, the tests results said that while crisis situations in the power grid were “unlikely in winter 22/23, they cannot be completely ruled out.” The energy ministry said that starting in January 2023, the reactors should be relied on only in emergency conditions. Drought across Europe and nuclear power shortages in France this summer were a stark reminder of how unpredictable the risks can be. France’s nuclear power plants were at half capacity because of maintenance issues. Severe Europe-wide drought brought water levels of the Rhine River in Germany so low that the country was unable to ship as much coal on barges to fire the coal plants that have been restarted as an alternative to gas.",2022-09-05T21:01:51.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

But there is another issue at stake, and that is the incredible inconsistency in the furor surrounding the establishment of evacuation plans for nuclear plants, but not for any other facilities of comparable risk. Accidents involving major chemical facilities, gas and oil storage sites, and dams, to mention only a few, pose risks similar to, and often greater than, nuclear power plants. In another example, the much heralded high-tech activities for semiconductor production (often billed, ironically, as a clean technology) involve storage of large quantities of extremely toxic chemicals, which, in the event of accident or earthquake, could lead to disaster, according to a report from California (news story, Feb. 8). Nuclear power plants do not pose unique risks either in probability or potential impact. Bhopal - far more serious in its impact than Chernobyl - amply illustrates that. But there are domestic examples as well. In 1976, the Grand Teton Dam failure was, fortunately, limited in impact to fewer than a dozen fatalities (although more than $500 million in damages was claimed). A dam failure in Italy killed more than 2,000, and there are several dams in the United States that put at risk hundreds of thousands of people. Even the prosaic railroad industry poses significant risks in the transport of hazardous materials, with accidents commonly leading to sudden evacuations. For example, more than 250,000 people were evacuated from a Toronto suburb a few years ago because of a chlorine rail-car derailment. There are very good reasons for a state government to facilitate the establishment of sensible and effective emergency plans for all types of facilities and accidents. In seeking to eliminate nuclear plants by setting impossible standards for emergency preparedness, what states ignore is that such plans can serve as models for other facilities. A number of utility nuclear emergency plans have already been implemented to respond to situations entirely unrelated to the power plant.

Although the long-awaited energy policy was named the “Revolutionary Energy and Environment Strategy” by its authors, it extended the expected transition away from nuclear power by at least a decade and includes caveats that appear to allow some plants to operate for decades past even the new deadline. The government had been considering several options: whether to close all the plants over time or to maintain enough reactors to provide a smaller but still substantial percentage of the country’s electricity needs. Before the nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, Japan depended on its reactors for about 30 percent of its electricity and had planned to raise that share to more than 50 percent by 2030. The announcement comes after months of increasing anxiety and intense political pressure from those on both sides of the debate who believe Japan’s future is at stake. Many political and business leaders argue that shutting nuclear plants would doom the resource-poor country to high energy costs and a deeper economic malaise. But many Japanese, while acknowledging the economic upheaval it could cause, have expressed hope that the country will phase out nuclear energy within two decades and a nascent, but increasingly vocal antinuclear movement has pressed for even faster action. While important for setting a tone, the announced strategy is subject to vast change, not only because of the long lead time, but also because the unpopular prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, and his governing Democratic Party are likely to lose the next national election, which could be called within the next several months. Analysts have suggested the Democrats timed the announcement to give them a political lift, but it is unlikely to appease either the antinuclear movement or powerful business interests. Those who favor a phaseout blasted the strategy announced Friday as too vague and drawn out. “It’s trickery with words and numbers,” said Tetsunari Iida, director of the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies, a research group based in Tokyo. “The zero number might be symbolic politically, but in reality, it holds little meaning.” And an influential business federation, Keidanren, this week made clear that eliminating nuclear power was “unrealistic and unreachable,” according to its chairman, Hiromasa Yonekura. With the long-term energy plan set, the political battle is set to refocus on the struggle by the government to build consensus for reopening the vast majority of the country’s reactors, which were idled after the nuclear catastrophe, amid public opposition to restarts until better safety regulations were in place. The government has sought repeatedly to regain the public’s trust, most recently by scrapping its former nuclear regulatory agency and creating a new one. But that plan has already come under fire, with criticism focusing on Shunichi Tanaka, the head of a committee that would set nuclear policy and retain oversight over the new agency and its leadership. Mr. Tanaka is considered suspect by those who favor tighter regulation because he helped lead a former government commission tasked with building a strong nuclear industry — raising fears that the new regulator will be as lax as the old. In announcing the energy plan, Motohisa Furukawa, the minister of state for national policy, said there was no change to the government’s quest to restart those reactors. And although the long-term plan stipulates that no new reactors will be built, it leaves open the possibility that seven reactors at varying stages of construction could be activated. That decision would be left up to the new nuclear committee headed by Mr. Tanaka. And although the government said reactors would be closed after life spans of 40 years, it also said that exemptions could be granted, suggesting that the 2040 deadline was flexible. (By comparison, Germany, which in 2010 relied on reactors for 26 percent of its electricity, was rattled enough by the Fukushima disaster to announce a move away from nuclear power by 2022.) At an unusually lively news conference, seemingly exasperated reporters pressed for whether any firm decisions had been made. One reporter for a Japanese newspaper suggested that if reactors under construction are allowed to come on line and get exemptions for operating more than 40 years, “then we could still have reactors running in the 2070s.” Mr. Furukawa did not dispute that possibility. The energy plan underscores the challenges Japan faces in extricating itself from nuclear power. If idled reactors were permanently closed this year, power companies would be hit with losses totaling $55.9 billion, making at least four of the utilities insolvent, according to the government’s Agency for Natural Resources and Energy. Because the industry is tightly regulated, allowing almost no competition, the country relies on those power companies and can ill afford to have them go bankrupt. The 2040 time frame would allow most of the existing reactors to live out their 40-year life span, heading off costly losses for their operators. Japanese utilities have already been saddled with the huge costs of buying oil and natural gas to meet the nuclear shortfall since the reactors were taken offline, a burden that would be alleviated once their reactors are restarted. With only two reactors operating, Japan struggled through a sweltering summer after parts of the country were asked to conserve electricity use by as much as 15 percent, the second year such requests were made. Power companies fired up old gas- and oil-powered stations and scrambled to secure imported fossil fuels. Despite fears of widespread blackouts, however, none materialized, strengthening nuclear critics’ argument that Japan could do without nuclear energy. But the Keidanren business federation and others have insisted that the higher energy costs are crippling the country’s economy. Tokyo Electric, Japan’s largest utility and the operator of the Fukushima Daiichi plant, has increased rates for both homes (an average of more than 8 percent) and businesses (an average of about 15 percent). Businesss leaders warn that such costs will prompt more companies to move their operations overseas. And costly fuel imports already contributed last year to Japan’s first annual trade deficit in more than 30 years and made the nation more dependent on oil and natural gas from the volatile Middle East and Russia. Whatever its choices, Japan is set to significantly increase its investment in clean energy sources, in part to avoid enlarging its carbon footprint. The balancing act that the government is attempting with its new energy policy made little impression on the antinuclear protesters who now gather every Friday night in Tokyo. Many had expected the government to at least phase out the reactors by 2030, a date that had initially been discussed, and some were angry that the time frame was at least a decade longer. “They’re ignoring the terror that many of us feel toward nuclear power,” said Kumi Tomiyasu, an employee at a Tokyo-based printing company who attended a rally in front of the prime minister’s office on Friday. “By sticking with nuclear for so long, the government has put the interests of power companies and big business above those of the Japanese people.”",2012-09-14T16:40:53.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The head of the United Nations’ atomic watchdog expressed astonishment on Thursday about international complacency over safety at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, where several hours earlier Russian shelling had again cut power to the plant and left workers resorting to using backup generators to maintain safety. It was the sixth time the Zaporizhzhia facility, Europe’s largest nuclear plant, needed to move to its emergency power supply since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine a year ago, according to Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. watchdog. He described the use of generators there as the “last line of defense” against a possible nuclear accident. In a fiery statement to the agency’s board of governors on Thursday, Mr. Grossi urged immediate action to restore security at the plant, which was Russian forces occupied shortly after invading the country a year ago. “What are we doing?” he said, according to the agency. “How can we sit here in this room this morning and allow this to happen? This cannot go on.” He added, “I am astonished by the complacency.” “Each time, we are rolling a dice,” Mr. Grossi said, “and if we allow this to continue time after time, then one day our luck will run out.” The board, which decides policy for the organization, is made up of 35 member states including Russia, according to the agency’s website. Russian shelling early Thursday cut the external power lines that supply electricity to the plant’s six reactors, according to Ukraines’s state nuclear company, Energoatom. The company said the plant had a supply of diesel to power the generators for 10 days, although the I.A.E.A., which has stationed inspectors at the plant, said there was enough fuel for 15 days. Bringing additional diesel supplies across the front line in the southern Zaporizhzhia region is extremely difficult, and Energoatom warned of the danger of not having enough power for the facility, whose equipment to prevent a radiation leak requires a constant source of fuel, even with all of the reactors offline. “If it is impossible to renew the external power supply of the station during this time, an accident with radiation consequences for the whole world may occur,” the company said on Telegram. External power to the plant was last cut off in November, Mr. Grossi said. Each time the power source to the plant has been severed, engineers have raced to make repairs before the plant’s 18 diesel generators run out of fuel. International nuclear inspectors have repeatedly called the situation unsustainable and precarious. The U.N. atomic agency has spent months trying to forge an agreement between Moscow and Kyiv to establish a safety and security zone around the plant. But Ukraine’s energy minister said this week that talks were at a dead end because Russia had refused his government’s demand to withdraw from the plant and hand control of it back to Energoatom. Moscow has placed the plant under the control of its own state nuclear company, Rosatom. The predawn shelling on Thursday came as Russia launched missile and drone attacks across Ukraine as part of a monthslong campaign to damage the country’s power infrastructure. Since Moscow’s troops began occupying the Zaporizhzhia facility, it has been hit by rocket fire, which at one point damaged an area where spent nuclear fuel is stored.

The European Commission said it had begun consultations with European Union countries on the proposal, which is intended to provide a common set of definitions of what constitutes a “sustainable investment” in Europe. Any final plan can be blocked by a majority of member states or by the European Parliament. “The Commission considers there is a role for natural gas and nuclear as a means to facilitate the transition towards a predominantly renewable-based future,” the statement, released on Saturday, said. The proposal caps one of the most heated political battles in Europe at a time when its leaders have pledged to pull the planet back from the brink of climate catastrophe. It follows months of intense lobbying pitting a pronuclear bloc led by President Emmanuel Macron of France, Europe’s biggest atomic power producer, over objections from Germany and other countries that are wary of a proliferation of nuclear power on European soil.",2022-01-04T12:07:36.000+01:00,NYTIMES,europe

Large color photographs in the window showed the progress of the company's 800-megawatt Shoreham nuclear plant, already under construction at another Island site 10 miles west in the Town of Brookhaven. Nuclear power seemed to have a bright future on Long Island. Its few opponents, led by a pesky group from Lloyd Harbor and their lawyer, Irving Like, were seemingly engaged in a futile campaign. Twenty years later, the Shoreham plant was defunct and abandoned, the Jamesport proposal was a memory, and Lilco, the would-be nuclear utility, was negotiating with a state agency that wants to disband it. In a defining Island epic, the $5.5 billion Shoreham plant, which in 1973 Lilco estimated would cost $500 million and open in 1977, became a battleground pitting Lilco, the nuclear power industry and Federal regulators against a growing number of Long Island opponents, local officials and a powerful Governor, Mario M. Cuomo. In the end, opponents outweighed supporters in numbers and influence. Most people had come to believe that densely populated Long Island was no place for nuclear power plants, because evacuation in the event of a serious accident would be virtually impossible. Nothing that Lilco or other nuclear power supporters said could convince opponents that the technology was safe, although the plant was tested at 5 percent of capacity, proving that it could work. The industry argued that a major nuclear plant accident was less likely than a meteor's hitting Times Square. But odds of an accident seemed much higher when the core overheated at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Middletown, Pa., on March 28, 1979, releasing radiation. In a step that had consequences for Long Island, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reacted by ordering expanded emergency evacuation plans for commercial nuclear power facilities. Barely two months later, on June 3, 1979, more than 15,000 people rallied against the Shoreham plant. The police arrested more than 600 people for climbing over the plants' fences. The rally, coming close on the heels of the Pennsylvania accident, seemed to mark the beginning of a shift in public opinion against the plant, which Lilco said was needed to meet future electric demand. The nuclear power future Lilco had planned for Long Island had begun to come unglued as early as 1976, when farmers in Riverhead objected to plans for routing overhead transmission lines from the proposed Jamesport plant across farms. A Riverhead lawyer hired by the Long Island Farm Bureau, Thomas A. Twomey Jr., broadened the opposition to focus on the proposed plant. As objections to the plant mounted on the Island's East End, the opponents found a powerful ally in Governor Hugh L. Carey, who had a home on Shelter Island. Mr. Carey eventually announced that ""Jamesport is dead."" The official demise was in January 1980, when a state board charged with choosing sites for power plants rejected the Lilco application. As an alternative, the board said, Lilco could build two coal-burning plants on the 500-acre Jamesport property. Lilco declined. By then new Federal regulations and construction delays had greatly increased Lilco's estimates of the Shoreham plant's cost, leading to a series of rate increases granted by the State Public Service Commission. Yet few imagined as the 1980's began that the Shoreham plant would never operate. The endgame for Shoreham began in February 1983, when Suffolk County abruptly withdrew from emergency evacuation planning after concluding that no plan would work. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, then in his first term, said the state should not approve Lilco's evacuation plan if the county opposed it. Because Federal regulations required state approval of emergency evacuation plans before a nuclear plant could be licensed, the county and state opposition became an enormous obstacle for Lilco. In accordance with Federal regulations, the Lilco plan covered a 10-mile radius around the plant. But polls showed that most Island residents thought they would be at risk if a major accident occurred. Residents living far outside the evacuation zone said they would try to flee. In May 1985, Suffolk County's government was thrown into crisis when County Executive Peter F. Cohalan, reversing his previous stand, ordered county agencies to take part in a test of Lilco's evacuation plan. Lilco responded by paying $131 million in property taxes it had withheld because of the county's refusal to cooperate in the test. The Suffolk County Legislature sued to overturn the order, and in July 1995 won a narrow victory in the New York State Court of Appeals. Only days earlier, the Public Service Commission penalized Lilco $1.35 billion for mismanaging construction of the plant, whose cost by then exceeded $4 billion. The impasse over emergency planning was eventually resolved when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ruled that local authorities would aid in the Lilco plan if an accident occurred. By the mid-1980's, Mr. Cuomo had emerged as Lilco's most powerful and implacable opponent. In 1986, he spearheaded creation of the Long Island Power Authority, a state agency empowered to buy out or condemn Lilco. Mr. Like, Mr. Twomey and other Shoreham opponents, including Richard M. Kessel and Nora Bredes, were appointed trustees. But subsequent buyout attempts, including a $7.45 billion offer in March 1988, were unsuccessful. Lilco's chairman, William J. Catacosinos, had said upon taking office in 1984 that building the Shoreham plant was a mistake. But in what Lilco described as a two-track policy, during the second half of the 1980's the company continued to seek a Federal license to operate the plant even as it negotiated with Mr. Cuomo for an agreement that would close it forever. In April 1989, less than a week before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted Lilco a license to operate the completed Shoreham plant commercially, Lilco's board approved an agreement with Mr. Cuomo that insured that it would never open. The agreement, which outraged some Lilco opponents who thought it was too generous to the company, allowed Lilco to recover costs for the plant as if it had gone into operation. Lilco shareholders approved the settlement in June 1989. The Shoreham plant thus became the only licensed commercial nuclear reactor in the country that never lighted a lamp. In February 1992, the Long Island Power Authority bought the plant from Lilco for $1. A $180 million decommissioning project was completed in 1994. Last week, the authority, now controlled by appointees of Gov. George E. Pataki, continued negotiations with Lilco to carry out a plan backed by Mr. Pataki for disbanding the company to cut electric rates by 12 percent. Under the plan, Lilco's generators and gas business would be sold to separate companies. The authority would buy and operate Lilco's transmission and distribution systems. Lilco, a company that gambled everything on nuclear power, would be paid for its assets and compensated for at least some of the remaining Shoreham debt. But it would never again sell electricity on Long Island.",1996-05-05T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

The Hong Kong electric utility, CLP , said in a statement that the leak was small and fell below international standards requiring reporting as a safety issue. CLP’s disclosure on Tuesday followed a report about the leak on Radio Free Asia. Chinese state media were silent on the topic. China plans to build three-quarters of the world’s new nuclear power plants in the coming decade as part of a broad effort to diversify its sources of electricity and limit pollution from the burning of fossil fuels. China has not announced accidents in its civilian nuclear power program, and no major cases are known to have occurred. The plant, located on Daya Bay in Shenzhen, adjacent to Hong Kong, continued producing electricity without disruption, CLP said. The Security Bureau of the Hong Kong government said that 10 radiation sensors in Hong Kong had not detected any increases since the leak, which occurred on May 23. The Daya Bay plant uses two loops of fluid in making power. The fluid in one heats as it circulates around the fuel rods, then transfers the heat to water in a second loop of intertwined pipes. The steam produced expands through a turbine, spinning it to generate electricity. The leak occurred when radioactive iodine escaped from at least one of the French-made fuel rods, CLP said, adding that an investigation was under way to identify how that happened. The radioactive iodine, a byproduct of splitting uranium atoms, leaked into the fluid surrounding the fuel rods but did not contaminate the water whose steam powers the turbine, CLP said. CLP said that the plant  which is 75 percent owned by the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group , one of the country’s two rival state-owned nuclear power giants  had reported the incident to mainland Chinese regulators. But it was not serious enough to be rated on the International Atomic Energy Agency’s scale for assessing the seriousness of nuclear safety incidents, the company said. Radioactive iodine is a serious health concern because it is easily ingested by the body, particularly by children. The United States keeps large numbers of iodine tablets ready in case of a leak because people taking small, daily quantities of iodine by tablet are likely to absorb less radioactive iodine.",2010-06-15T19:57:05.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

While a direct military strike on one of the reactor cores could still trigger an accident, the risk is greatly reduced if the plant is not operating. Russian soldiers are still occupying the plant, and there have been reports of workers running the facility at gunpoint. But there have also been constant disputes over who is shelling the facility, and whether to cut off the external power that keeps critical cooling systems operating. The move is meant to put the last of six working reactors into a relatively safe state as fighting swirls around the facility in southern Ukraine.

Dozens of emergency workers were killed at the scene, while vast tracts of land were evacuated and still lie fallow. Rates of thyroid cancer soared among children in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, and sustained exposure to low levels of radiation in the area has killed or will yet kill thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of adults. The exact number of casualties will never be known. For decades before Chernobyl, the public had been assured that nuclear reactors could not explode like bombs and that the association of reactors with nuclear weapons was essentially false. By calling those claims into question, the accident, together with the disappointing performance of atomic power plants during the 1970's and 1980's, pretty much guaranteed that no reactor projects would be initiated for the remainder of the century. And yet, though it went unnoticed at the time and has been inadequately appreciated since, Chernobyl also cast into relief the positive features of the reactors used in the United States and most other advanced industrial countries. The reactor at Chernobyl belonged to a class that was especially vulnerable to runaway reactions. When operating at low power, if such reactors lost water, their reactivity could suddenly take off and very rapidly reach a threshold beyond which they could only explode. Making matters worse, surprisingly little more pressure than normal in the machine's water channels would lift its lid, snapping the vital control rods and fuel channels that entered the reactor's core. On the night of April 25, 1986, poorly trained and supervised plant operators conducted an ill-conceived experiment, putting the machine into the very state in which reactivity was most likely to spike. Within a fraction of a second, the reactor went from being barely on to power levels many times higher than the maximum intended. This kind of accident cannot happen in the so-called light water reactors used in the United States and most of Western Europe and Asia. In these reactors, the water functions not only as a coolant but as a ''moderator'': self-sustaining nuclear chain reactions cannot take place in its absence. This is a very useful passive safety feature. If coolant runs low, there is still a danger of a core meltdown, because the fuel retains heat; but the reactor will have automatically and immediately turned itself off. Still, critics and opponents of nuclear energy have wondered whether utility companies are competent enough to manage anything so complex as a reactor. The question is a reasonable one. In the 1980's, some anti-nuclear groups joined with free-marketeers to promote electricity deregulation. They reasoned that if utilities were no longer guaranteed cost-plus returns on investments -- the cushy sort of regulation that had prevailed for a century in the utility industry -- they would stop investing in expensive nuclear power plants that were difficult to run. The utility industry has responded to deregulation by reorganizing itself. And as it happens, companies have emerged that specialize in managing nuclear power plants. Although their record is somewhat mixed (Exelon, for example, stands accused of having carelessly let tritium, a radioactive isotope, leak from three Illinois reactors), on the whole the performance of nuclear power plants has improved substantially. In 1986, the average American nuclear plant produced electricity barely 57 percent of the time. In 2004, the average plant was running productively more than 90 percent of the time. This improvement has come just in time. The effects of global warming are disturbingly obvious, and yet the United States has fallen dangerously far behind its response. If we're to get into step with the world effort to reduce greenhouse gases, we are going to need to rely more, not less, on carbon-free nuclear energy.

Russia still refuses to restrain its transfers of nuclear and weapons technology to Iran. Russian technology could help Tehran's radical mullahs acquire nuclear weapons and delivery systems that could threaten the United States and Europe, including Russia itself. President Vladimir Putin should reconsider this relationship, and President Bush needs to make clear that Russia's ties with Iran are a serious impediment to Moscow's international aspirations. The technology transfers flow from Russia's lucrative contracts to supply Iran with a nuclear power reactor and advanced conventional weapons. The sales are an important revenue source for Russia's beleaguered arms and energy industries. Yet Russia stands to benefit far more from the improved trade relations now on offer from the West than from these risky deals with Iran. More than 1,000 Russian engineers and technicians are helping Iran build a civilian power reactor at Bushehr on the Persian Gulf. When completed in several years, the reactor will produce plutonium as a byproduct of power generation. That plutonium could potentially be reprocessed into nuclear bomb fuel using technology learned from the Russians. Last year Russia resumed sales of conventional arms to Iran, including an advanced air defense system. American intelligence agencies also report that Moscow is secretly transferring ballistic missile technology to Tehran, including suspected transfers through front companies in the former Soviet republics of Moldova and Armenia. When Mr. Bush raised the nuclear and missile technology issues with Mr. Putin last month, he got only unconvincing verbal reassurances that Russian scientists would not transfer dangerous technologies. Russia misleadingly argues that the United States is helping North Korea build similar nuclear power reactors. Washington's deal with North Korea is specifically linked to Pyongyang's commitment not to reprocess the reactor's plutonium. Although Iran has signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and has agreed to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect the Bushehr facility, Washington has good reason to believe that Tehran is intent on secretly developing nuclear weapons and will use Russian technology to do so. Energy-starved North Korea has a legitimate need for nuclear-generated power, while Iran is one of the world's leading oil producers. Moscow's dealings with Iran belong to a bygone era and run directly counter to Mr. Putin's goal of realigning Russia with the West. Instead of helping the weapons programs of rogue states, Moscow should be working with Washington to meet the threat the two countries face from the alarming spread of unconventional weapons.",2002-06-10T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,opinion

Yet a highlight of President Bush’s recent trip there was the signing of an agreement to cooperate on developing civilian nuclear energy. Saudi Arabia is only one of many nations in the Middle East suddenly eager for nuclear power. There’s no prohibition against such deals and we’re not suggesting there should be  as long as governments abide by international rules for inspections and transparency. Nuclear energy is one way to address the problem of climate change, and developing countries must have the same access to the technology as the developed world. But there are alarming signs that this sudden enthusiasm is driven less by concerns about the climate, or declining oil supplies, than by Iran’s growing nuclear proficiency. In addition to building power plants, Tehran is determined to produce its own nuclear fuel  a process that with a little more work could also churn out fuel for a nuclear bomb. Meanwhile, the major nuclear powers  especially the United States, France, Russia and China  are eagerly competing for the world’s nuclear business. France’s president, Nicolas Sarkozy, has been particularly aggressive, engaging at least seven countries. Washington recently also signed deals with Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. Amid all their salesmanship, none of these leaders have come up with a strategy to halt the spread of nuclear fuel technology. Countries that agree to full monitoring also have the right to such technology, but it is far too easy to divert to a military program. Back in 2004, Mr. Bush suggested that countries that make fuel technology should sell it only to countries that are already in the nuclear fuel business. Others were less enthusiastic, and the president  who was mainly thinking about Iran  didn’t push very hard. He also didn’t come up with a credible strategy for guaranteeing buyers an uninterrupted supply of fuel. When Iran insists that it only wants a fuel program because it can’t trust the United States and its allies not to cut off its deliveries, a lot of countries that should know better end up sympathizing. We are relieved that Riyadh has promised to buy fuel for its future reactors on the international market. But that is not enough. Before signing more deals, Washington and the other nuclear sellers must find ways to lessen the chances that expanding nuclear energy today will result in more weapons tomorrow. An international fuel bank would be a good first step.",2008-05-26T08:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,editorial-opinion

The combined company intends to sell electricity in major markets around the country as states open up their utilities to competition, betting that its nuclear plants will produce energy more cheaply than competing sources of power. ''These companies are going to be a nuclear powerhouse,'' said Robert Rubin, a utility analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company who has followed the trend closely. He said that if the plants were managed well, the combined company would have ''a substantial edge in terms of being able to market power and make money.'' A company with access to huge amounts of nuclear power could squeeze out a profit while undercutting the prices of other marketers, Mr. Rubin said. That could eventually push down rates for customers. The merger, which is subject to approvals by an array of regulatory agencies, would bring together Unicom's four nuclear plants, with a capacity of 13,470 megawatts, and two nuclear plants operated by Peco, with 4,070 megawatts of capacity. The two companies have more than five million customers in Pennsylvania and Illinois. In addition, Peco has formed a joint venture with British Energy P.L.C. called Amergen, which has bought four nuclear plants and is negotiating to buy a fifth. Amergen already owns plants with total capacity of 3,625 megawatts. The new Peco-Unicom combination, which has not yet been named, would assume Peco's role in Amergen, executives said. Altogether, the nuclear plants associated with the combined company would represent about 17 percent of the nation's nuclear capacity. Corbin A. McNeill Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Peco, announced the merger at a news conference in Philadelphia along with John W. Rowe, the chairman and chief executive of Unicom. Mr. McNeill, a former nuclear submarine commander, said that Amergen was interested in acquiring more nuclear plants. ''We intend to be the premier nuclear operator in the nation,'' he said. Under the merger terms, Peco stockholders will receive one share in the new holding company for each share of Peco stock, or $45 in cash. Unicom shareholders would get 0.95 share in the new holding company for each share of Unicom stock, or $42.75 in cash. The cash price is a premium of about 11 percent to average stock prices of Peco and Unicom over a 10-day period through Wednesday. Shares of Peco closed yesterday at $36.4375, down $1.6875, and Unicom closed at $36.25, down 81.25 cents, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The transaction is not expected to add debt, Mr. Rubin said, and therefore will save in interest expense. The executives said that about 5 percent of the combined work force of 22,500 would be phased out. Mr. Rowe and Mr. McNeill intend to share responsibility in the new holding company, which will be based in Chicago, until the end of 2003, when Mr. Rowe will become chairman and the sole chief executive. Both executives took pains to reassure customers in Philadelphia and Chicago that the utilities would also maintain staff members in both cities and support local institutions to which they have been important contributors. Mr. Rowe, who was brought into Unicom in March of 1998 because of his experience as a troubleshooter, said his company would continue to focus on repairing the transmission system of its subsidiary, Commonwealth Edison. ''It's going to be hard work but we don't flinch from that,'' he said. In August, a series of blackouts shut down the Chicago Board of Trade and the Field Museum for short periods and Chicago's Loop lost power one afternoon. Martin Cohen, the executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, the official watchdog group for consumers in Chicago, said that Unicom had had problems operating its nuclear plants in the past, but it brought in Oliver D. Kingsley Jr., an expert, as executive vice president in charge of nuclear operations.

The company warned last winter that it could no longer produce a steady nuclear power supply, as it struggled to catch up with a two-year backlog in required maintenance for dozens of aging reactors that was put off during coronavirus lockdowns. Inspections unearthed alarming safety issues — especially corrosion and faulty welding seals on crucial systems used to cool a reactor’s radioactive core. That was the situation at the Chinon atomic plant, one of France’s oldest, which produces 6 percent of EDF’s nuclear power. EDF is now scouring all its nuclear facilities for such problems. A dozen reactors will stay disconnected for corrosion inspections or repairs that could take months or years. Another 16 remain offline for reviews and upgrades. Others are having to cut power production because of climate change concerns: Rivers in the south of France, including the Rhône and the Gironde, are warming earlier each year, often reaching temperatures in the spring and summer too warm to cool reactors. Today, French nuclear production is at its lowest level since 1993, generating less than half the 61.4 gigawatts that the fleet is capable of producing. (EDF also generates electricity with renewable technologies, gas and coal.) Even if some reactors resume in the summer, French nuclear output will be 25 percent lower than usual this winter — with alarming consequences. “If you have power plants that are operating well below capacity, we will either have to go to blackouts or revert to carbon-emitting energy, which is coal or natural gas,” said Thierry Bros, an energy expert and professor at the Paris Institute of Political Studies.",2022-06-18T11:00:14.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

The reports are prepared by the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, a utility organization based in Atlanta that sends delegations of nuclear experts to plants across the country to assess personnel and procedures. The reports are almost always kept secret. But one that was released on the Philadelphia Electric Company and its Peach Bottom reactors after operators were caught napping in the control room eventually resulted in the departure of several executives and a reorganizaton of the utility's nuclear program. The ruling to release the documents, made by William F. Barnes, the deputy secretary of the commission, came in response to a request by the Critical Mass Energy Project, a Ralph Nader organization, in a letter dated July 15. The ruling, which was opposed by the three investor-owned utilities in New York that operate reactors, is likely to be appealed. The utilities -- Consolidated Edison, Rochester Gas and Electric and the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation -- had argued that if the reports were public, their employees would be less candid in describing problems to the industry inspectors and the inspectors would also be more circumspect. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has access to the reports, but to avoid making them subject to the Freedom of Information Act, has generally avoided putting them in its files. But Mr. Barnes ruled that ""management should encourage the creation of an environment that enables individuals to forthrightly and candidly discuss problems and improvements that should be made, because nuclear power plant operations present the possibility of dire catastrophic consequences.""",1991-07-19T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

''We had a bright business year with happily generous revenues and reasonable profits,'' Klaus Barthelt, chairman of Kraftwerk Union, a builder of nuclear power plants, said recently of the company's 1985 results. But, he added, ''the shadows are growing longer.'' Though Kraftwerk Union, a subsidiary of the giant Siemens electrical group, nearly tripled its pretax earnings last year to $160 million, Mr. Barthelt reported that the volume of orders on hand, which includes contracts for 11 nuclear power plants, had dropped by the end of the year to the equivalent of $10.7 billion, from $13.1 billion the year earlier. Such feelings of unease seem alien to an industry that, despite rigid resistance to nuclear power in many European countries, has managed to capture a large share of the world market. It has done so by concentrating on high technology in standardized packages and favorable financing terms. Few Players Are Left The industry, nevertheless, has dwindled to a small elite club, whose major players are Kraftwerk Union, or KWU, in West Germany; Framatome, a unit of France's state-controlled Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, and Asea-Atom, the nuclear power division of Sweden's Asea electrical group. They compete head-on, and sometimes cooperate with such large American companies as Westinghouse and General Electric, or the Candu Operations division of Atomic Energy of Canada. But after the incident at the Soviet power plant, the shadows are indeed widening. The Dutch Government said it was delaying plans to expand from one to five nuclear power plants by the 1990's. Similarly, Finland said it would re-evaluate increasing its plants from four to six. Yugoslav officials have said they will press ahead with plans to add four more nuclear generating stations to the one now in operation at a cost of roughly $10 billion. But industry executives say they expect delays. Several European companies, including KWU, are bidding for those projects. Financial Cutbacks, Too These delays and possible cancellations are unsettling, since they come in the wake of cutbacks elsewhere for financial reasons. Egypt and Turkey have delayed decisions on new projects. A revised version of China's current five-year plan was issued in March without plans for two new atomic power plants to have been built in Sunan province, and for which some European companies had hoped to bid. Elsewhere, although governments have reiterated their commitment to nuclear power, domestic resistance has reached a fever pitch. In Rome, more than 100,000 people demonstrated recently to protest continuation of the modest Italian program. In West Germany, police have fought fierce battles with armed demonstrators opposing construction of West Germany's first nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Wackersdorf, in Bavaria. That plant is designed to eliminate dependence on Britain and France for reprocessing spent fuel elements when it begins processing 350 tons of used fuel a year in the 1990's. The stakes are high for companies such as KWU, which has a $715 million chunk of the contracts at Wackersdorf. Though projects are few, the immense contracts are crucial for European economies. KWU's Mr. Barthelt estimated recently that about 25 percent of the value of an order goes to KWU, with the rest spread among up to 700 subcontractors and suppliers. ''Their know-how and ability is in danger of rupture if the major orders dry up.'' Mr. Barthelt said. Some Positive Aspects Nevertheless, some analysts believe the long-term effect of Chernobyl will not be entirely negative. ''There's a widespread recognition in sectors of the public that make decisions that generally the United States and Europe are doing better on safety,'' said David Barker, an energy analyst at Arthur D. Little in London. Other factors, Mr. Barker said, would outweigh the accident in determining choice. ''A whole series of issues is related to choice,'' he said. ''The size of grid means a limited number of countries can build a 600-megawatt plant, and another problem is up-front finance. The capital costs are 90 percent of the cost of power.'' Industry officials agreed that although some of the lag in Europe and North America may be made up by industrializing countries, such as China, Yugoslavia or Egypt, the effects may be limited because of financing problems and a preference for wide participation by domestic industries in the projects. KWU withdrew a bid for a Turkish plant, when Ankara insisted it run the finished plant itself and pay for it with revenues from the power generated over 20 years. Asea-Atom did not bid in Yugoslavia, Arto Hamberg, an executive, said. ''We concluded it was difficult to realize the bid in Yugoslav currency and with 100 percent countertrade for some of the contract,'' he said.",1986-06-16T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,financial-desk-business-day

A recurring fear haunts the West's increasingly tense confrontation with Iran: Is its work on civilian nuclear power actually a ruse for making a deadly atomic arsenal, as has been the case with other countries? Next month, the United Nations plans to take up that question at a board meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in Vienna. The diplomatic backdrop includes possible sanctions and even the threat of war. ''If Iran goes nuclear, you worry that Hezbollah goes nuclear,'' said Paul Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, a private group in Washington, referring to the Iran-backed terrorist group. The Iranian crisis, and related ones simmering in North Korea and also around Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani expert who recently confessed to running nuclear black markets, are giving new urgency to limiting proliferation, a central danger of the atomic era. Recently, international inspectors discovered that North Korea may have clandestinely supplied uranium to Libya, demonstrating how an aspiring state can secretly reach for nuclear arms. The development of such arsenals is often hard to hide, because it takes place in large industrial complexes where nuclear power and nuclear weapons are joined at the hip -- using technologies that are often identical, or nearly so. Today, with what seems like relative ease, scientists can divert an ostensibly peaceful program to make not only electricity but also highly pure uranium or plutonium, both excellent bomb fuels. Experts now talk frankly about a subject that was once taboo: ''virtual'' weapon states -- Japan, Germany, Belgium, Canada, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Taiwan and a dozen other countries that have mastered the basics of nuclear power and could, if they wanted, quickly cross the line to make nuclear arms, probably in a matter or months. Experts call it breakout. The question now, driven largely by the perception that the world is entering a dangerous new phase of nuclear proliferation, is whether the two endeavors can be separated. And as difficult as that may seem, new initiatives are rising to meet the challenge. Last year, North Korea stunned the world by withdrawing from the Nonproliferation Treaty. It was the first time a nation had dropped out of the 1968 pact, setting a grim precedent and prompting warnings of the accord's demise. If another virtual power crosses the line, experts fear, it could start a chain reaction in which others feel they have no alternative but to do likewise. Yet a country like Iran can retain its virtual-weapons status -- and the threat of breakout -- even if the International Atomic Energy Agency gives it a clean bill of health. That kind of quandary is driving the wider debate on ways to safeguard nuclear power, especially given that the world may rely on it increasingly as worries grow about global warming and oil shortages. ''We can't give absolute guarantees,'' said Graham Andrew, a senior scientist at the agency. ''But there will be technological developments to make the fuel cycle more proliferation-resistant.'' Other experts agree. ''The future looks better than the past in terms of this whole problem,'' said Rose Gottemoeller, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''At the moment, it's a very, very fast-moving arena that a lot of people are into and thinking about.'' The central compact of the nuclear age -- what critics call a deal with the devil -- is that countries can get help from other nations in developing nuclear power if they pledge to renounce nuclear arms. That principle was codified in the 1968 treaty and has produced a vast apparatus of the International Atomic Energy Agency that not only helps nations go peacefully nuclear but also monitors them for cheating. But surveillance has proved far from perfect, and states have proved far from trustworthy. ''If you look at every nation that's recently gone nuclear,'' said Mr. Leventhal of the Nuclear Control Institute, ''they've done it through the civilian nuclear fuel cycle: Iraq, North Korea, India, Pakistan, South Africa. And now we're worried about Iran.'' The moral, he added, is that atoms for peace can be ''a shortcut to atoms for war.'' Moreover, the raw material is growing. The world now has 440 commercial nuclear reactors and 31 more under construction. Experts say Iran provides a good example of the breakout danger. With the right tweaks, its sprawling complex now under construction could make arms of devastating force. Recently, mistrust over that prospect soared when inspectors found that Iran had hidden some of its most sensitive nuclear work as long as 18 years. In the central desert near Yazd, the country now mines uranium in shafts up to a fifth of a mile deep. At Isfahan, an ancient city that boasts a top research center, it is building a factory for converting the ore into uranium hexafluoride. When heated, the crystals turn into a gas ideal for processing to recover uranium's rare U-235 isotope, which, in bombs and reactors, easily splits in two to produce bursts of atomic energy. Nearby at Natanz, Iran aims to feed the gas into 50,000 centrifuges -- tall, thin machines that spin extraordinarily fast to separate the relatively light U-235 isotope from its heavier cousin, U-238. It recently came to light that Iran had gained much help in making its centrifuges from Dr. Khan and his secretive network. Iran says it wants to enrich the uranium to about 5 percent U-235, the level needed for nuclear reactors. But enrichment is one place that good power programs can easily go bad, nonproliferation experts say. By simply lengthening the spin cycle, a nation can enrich the uranium up to 90 percent U-235, the high purity usually preferred for bombs. Moreover, a dirty little secret of the atomic world is that the hardest step is enriching uranium for reactors, not bombs. David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, an arms control group in Washington, said the step from reactor to weapon fuel took roughly 25 percent more effort. The whirling centrifuges at Natanz could make fuel for up to 20 nuclear weapons every year, according to the Carnegie Endowment. Others put the figure at 25 bombs a year. The Iranians are building a large power reactor at Bushehr on the Persian Gulf meant to be fueled with low-enriched uranium from Natanz. Here too, experts say, a good program can go bad. Normally, uranium fuel stays in a reactor for three or four years and, as an inadvertent byproduct of atomic fission, becomes slowly riddled with plutonium 239, the other good material for making atom bombs. But the spent fuel also accumulates plutonium 240, which is so radioactive that it can be very difficult to turn into weapons. But if the reactor's fuel is changed frequently -- every few months -- that cuts the P-240 to preferable levels for building an arsenal. (And since less plutonium than uranium is needed for a blast of equal size, it is the preferred material for making compact warheads that are relatively easy to fit on missiles.) John R. Bolton, the State Department's under secretary for arms control, recently told Congress that after several years of operation, Bushehr could make enough plutonium for more than 80 nuclear weapons. Iran strongly denies such ambitions. ''That we are on the verge of a nuclear breakthrough is true,'' Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's former president, said recently, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency. ''But we are not seeking nuclear weapons.'' If Iran wanted to recover plutonium from Bushehr, or a different reactor under construction at Arak, it would have to extract the metal from spent fuel, a hard job because of the waste's high radioactivity. Such reprocessing plants have legitimate commercial uses for turning nuclear detritus into new fuel, as France, Britain, Japan and Russia do. Iran, too, has announced that it wants to master the complete nuclear fuel cycle, apparently including reprocessing. Last year, President Mohammad Khatami said the country wanted to recycle power-plant fuel. ''We are determined,'' he said in a televised speech, ''to use nuclear technology for civilian purposes.'' Around the globe, experts are struggling to find ways to guarantee such good intentions: not just in Iran, but everywhere. Mohamed ElBaradei, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, is calling for ''multinational controls'' on the production of any material that can be used for nuclear arms. If accepted, that would mean no single country could enrich uranium or reprocess plutonium on its own, but only in groups where members would verify each other's honesty. Early this month, Iran signaled that it might be interested in teaming with Russia and Europe to enrich uranium, giving arms controllers some hope of a peaceful resolution to the current crisis. Matthew Bunn, a nuclear expert at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, has called for sweetening the deal by guaranteeing members of a consortium lifetime fuel supplies and spent-fuel removal if they forgo enrichment and reprocessing plants. ''What you need is an incentive,'' he said. One challenge, he added, would be convincing states that consortiums ''won't change their minds,'' given that nuclear policy makers have often done so in the past. President Bush has taken a harder line, proposing in a February speech to limit drastically the number of nations allowed to produce nuclear fuel. Only states that already have enrichment and reprocessing plants, he said, should do such work, and they in turn would service countries that aspire to nuclear power. While many experts praise Mr. Bush's attention to the nonproliferation issue, some have faulted his specifics. ''It's all sticks and no carrots,'' said Mr. Bunn, adding that the Bush plan would only feed global resentment toward the nuclear club. ''I think you can couch this to be more carrotlike.'' Down the road, a different approach involves developing new classes of reactors that would better resist nuclear proliferation, especially by making the recovery of plutonium 239 much harder. Many studies, including one last year at M.I.T., have championed better fuel cycles and security. ''There is potentially a pathway -- diplomatic, technical -- to see a significant global deployment'' of safer technologies and strategies, said Ernest J. Moniz, a former Energy Department official who helped lead the M.I.T. study. ''But it can't happen without U.S. leadership and the U.S. partnering with other countries, and that will require a re-examination of our policies.'' Mr. Leventhal of the Nuclear Control Institute said too many of the proposals were too timid. Most fundamentally, he said, nations have to turn away from the commercial use of plutonium, which grows more abundant every day. ''Only denial and greed'' can explain the world's continuing to want plutonium for peaceful uses, he said, and added, ''It may take the unthinkable happening before the political process can screw up the courage to put an end to this ridiculously dangerous industry.''",2004-05-25T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,science
57c6f42d-46ac-4402-af2d-1069c02b9cc4,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/24/business/international/areva-nuclear-results.html,France Likely to Revamp Nuclear Energy Industry,"PARIS — France's energy minister said on Monday that an overhaul of the country’s state-controlled nuclear energy industry was imminent, after one of the country’s main builders of nuclear power plants warned of a loss that could hamper its ability to continue operating independently. The minister, Ségolène Royal, told reporters that France’s main nuclear power companies “should organize themselves to refocus on their core business, to forge alliances between major French enterprises and to win bids at the international level.” Ms. Royal spoke after Areva, one of the world’s leading nuclear technology companies, said in a preliminary statement that it expected a 2014 net loss of about 4.9 billion euros, or $5.6 billion, compared with a loss of €500 million a year earlier. The French government — which has continued to be a proponent of nuclear power when many other big industrial nations have been more equivocal or have come to oppose it outright — owns 87 percent of Areva, and nearly 85 percent of the other big French nuclear power company, EDF, once known as Électricité de France. EDF has been facing its own problems, including lengthy delays and steep cost overruns on a flagship plant that it is building at Flamanville, in the northwest of the country. There are also uncertainties about whether a showcase project in Britain will proceed — one in which both EDF and Areva would participate. The French nuclear industry’s travails underline the gloomy state of the nuclear industry since the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011. Moreover, the French industry, though long a world leader, has in recent years been threatened by its own mistakes. It has also had trouble coping with the emergence of new challengers like China to sell nuclear plants in countries in emerging markets and the West that value the clean-energy possibilities of nuclear power more than they fear the technology’s potential dangers. The loss that Areva warned of on Monday would be substantially larger than its stock-market value of about €3.7 billion, suggesting that the troubled company, plagued by cost overruns and write-downs, may need new funds to continue operating. Areva’s capabilities are vital to France’s ambitions to remain a world provider of nuclear plants and services like supplying fuel. With few new nuclear plants being planned to replace the older ones that are being phased out in the West, “Europe will see a gradual decline in nuclear’s share of electricity supply,” said Antony Froggatt, an analyst at Chatham House, a London-based research organization. Instead, the momentum is shifting eastward, with industry growth over the next few decades most likely to center on companies in China, India, Russia and South Korea. Although the United States is building few new plants, it still leads the world in power generated by nuclear plants, followed by France and Russia, according to the World Nuclear Association, a trade group. But the rising force in the industry is China, the site of about half of the nuclear stations being built or planned. India also has big nuclear plans and like China tends to favor its domestic companies. France, though, currently gets a larger share of its electricity from atomic power than any other country. Asked by a reporter if the government was prepared to inject new capital into Areva, Ms. Royal responded​ that it was “too early” to discuss the question but that “all solutions are being looked at.” Areva, which had said on Feb. 2 that its sales fell 8 percent last year to €8.3 billion, cited on Monday a variety of reasons for the gap in its finances, including asset write-downs and provisions against losses at its nuclear plant project on the Finnish island of Olkiluoto, which is far behind schedule and way over budget. The company said it was “working on developing a competitiveness plan and a strategic and financial road map’’ that it said it would present on March 4, when it is scheduled to report its financial results for 2014. Katherine ​Berezowskyj, an Areva spokeswoman, said on Monday that she could not comment beyond the statement, but that the details would be made clear next week. EDF did not respond to requests for comment. EDF’s much-heralded plan to showcase French technology in Britain with a £16 billion, or $24.6 billion, power station at Hinkley Point, England, is also looking uncertain. A decision on whether to proceed with construction, in which would be the first such plant to be built in Britain since the 1990s, might not be made any time soon, EDF said this month. Areva is listed as a partner and contractor in the Hinkley Point project, but the company’s recent losses raise questions about how much capital it can contribute. The companies had hoped to have the Hinkley Point plant operating by 2018, but now even 2023 looks optimistic. All of the European projects by Areva or EDF feature the EPR reactor, a 1990s design that was supposed to lock up a big share of global orders for France but is proving exceedingly complex and expensive to build. Areva noted that its announcement on Monday was made a week early “in view of the financial information recently appearing in the media.” Unsourced reports in the French media, including in the newspaper Le Figaro, had said in recent days that a big loss was expected. The company emphasized that the data was based on “unaudited preliminary financial information” that could change over the next week. ​Areva shares closed down 2.1 percent in Paris trading on Monday. The company, which is based in Paris, had previously warned that it was facing trouble; it said in November that it was suspending its financial guidance for 2015 and 2016. Standard & Poor’s cut the company’s debt rating to junk soon after that, citing the company’s “limited headroom.”",2015-02-23T13:48:14.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-international-business
95539240-33d7-41c2-bcee-e27cffb0e780,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/world/asia/03japan.html,A Governor’s Power To Shape the Future Of a Nuclear Japan,"SAGA, Japan — In a nation plagued by weak political leadership, it has fallen to the local governor of an obscure southern prefecture to make a crucial decision that could help determine the future of nuclear power in Japan after the Fukushima Daiichi accident . The governor, Yasushi Furukawa of Saga Prefecture, must decide in coming days whether to support a request by Prime Minister Naoto Kan to restart two reactors at a local nuclear plant that have been shut down since last winter for regular maintenance. There are growing warnings here that if he decides no, and other governors follow his lead, every nuclear reactor in Japan could end up idled in less than a year. That is because Japan’s reactors are legally required to shut down every 13 months for routine maintenance. Thirty-five of the nation’s 54 reactors are now offline, some because of damage from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, but most because of the maintenance requirement. Unless some of them are turned back on, the last reactor in Japan will be shut down by next April, depriving the nation of the source of almost a third of its electricity. Turning the idled reactors back on requires the central government’s approval, which has not been granted since the Fukushima accident. In the public backlash against nuclear power that has followed the disaster, the Kan government is asking local political leaders to sign off on the restarts as well. Mr. Furukawa is the first governor who is being called upon to make a decision. This has turned him into a bellwether of sorts on Japan’s nuclear future, as his decision will be closely watched by other local leaders who must weigh the same issues of public anxieties about safety versus the threat of electricity shortages. “I feel a great responsibility has been suddenly placed upon me,” Mr. Furukawa, 52, said in an interview. “Deciding not to restart the reactors could turn us into a non-nuclear country faster than Germany,” referring to that country’s decision to scrap nuclear power by 2022. All eyes are on Mr. Furukawa because most governors appear to be on the fence about restarting reactors. The newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported last month that governors of 10 prefectures that are home to nuclear plants had said in interviews that they did not support restarting their reactors, with most saying they needed more information about safety measures. (The governors of two other such prefectures were not interviewed.) On Monday, the governor of Fukushima went a step further, calling for an end to his prefecture’s economic and energy dependence on nuclear plants. Mr. Furukawa has publicly agonized over the decision, which he said he wanted to make by mid-July. On Wednesday, he said that he was satisfied by the central government’s safety explanations, signaling that he might be leaning toward restarting the reactors in his prefecture. The situation in Saga offers a telling glimpse at some of the forces shaping the debate over the nation’s nuclear future. While Japan has seen few of the large street demonstrations that the Fukushima accident has inspired abroad, there has been a clear public backlash against nuclear power. Recent opinion polls show an overwhelming majority — 82 percent in a survey conducted last month for Tokyo Shimbun — support getting rid of the nation’s reactors. However, the same polls show that most respondents do not favor an immediate halt, but a gradual phasing out of nuclear power as alternatives are found. Conversations here on the streets of Saga as well as with decision-makers in Tokyo reveal a nation torn between the dangers exposed by the Fukushima accident and the need of a resource-poor nation to keep its only serious energy alternative to imported coal and oil. “There is deep unease about the safety of nuclear power, but there is also deep unease about getting rid of it,” said Izuru Makihara, a political scientist at Tohoku University in Sendai. The prospect of all the reactors going offline has alarmed the business community and the nation’s powerful nuclear lobby, which have issued warnings of the dire economic consequences if nuclear power is lost. They warn of higher electricity prices or even blackouts that could damage Japan’s earthquake-shocked economy. In a sign of looming energy shortages here even without further reactor shutdowns, the government on Friday ordered factories and other large electricity users in Tokyo to cut usage this summer by 15 percent from last year. “If all the nuclear reactors are stopped, the effect on the economy would be enormous,” Mr. Kan warned late last month. Japan’s still-tiny antinuclear movement has won credibility since the Fukushima accident, though it is still popularly regarded as part of the leftist fringe. Activists complain that a deep apathy as well as a fear of being ostracized prevents many Japanese from taking action. “Many people support us from the shadows, but they are afraid of being disliked as radicals,” said Hatsumi Ishimaru, 59, a homemaker who leads an antinuclear group in Saga. Many people here say they are perplexed why this weighty decision has fallen on Saga, a rural prefecture of about 850,000 residents on the southernmost main island of Kyushu and a place whose main claims to fame are its glazed pottery and gourmet beef. Partly, it is a question of timing: two of the four reactors at its plant, the Genkai Nuclear Power Station, have been waiting to restart since finishing their routine maintenance two months ago. The other two reactors remain in operation. Governor Furukawa complained that the decision had fallen to him because Prime Minister Kan had failed to chart a clear direction on Japan’s post-Fukushima energy future. This is a criticism heard across Japan, and Mr. Kan has agreed to step down once crucial recovery bills are passed. “Prime Minister Kan is running away from a decision that the national government should be making,” Mr. Furukawa said. On Friday, the governor requested a meeting with Mr. Kan “to hear his energy vision.” The governor fumes that he is being pressed to come to a quick decision by the national government and by local business groups. Instead, he has repeatedly asked nuclear regulators and the plant’s operator, Kyushu Electric Power, for more detailed explanations on how they would prevent a Fukushima-style meltdown from happening here. “It is easy to see the business groups who favor restarting the reactors,” Mr. Furukawa said, “but the public unease that opposes it is shapeless.” On Wednesday, Mr. Kan sent his minister of trade and industry, Banri Kaieda, to Saga to explain safety measures directly to Mr. Furukawa. Last weekend, nuclear regulators held a hearing here in Saga on the plant’s safety that was broadcast live on cable television and online. While there is no legal requirement to get local approval, officials at Kyushu Electric say the current backlash against nuclear power makes it politically difficult to turn the reactors on without hometown approval. The manager of the Genkai plant, Masayasu Murashima, said he has visited the prefectural and nearby municipal assemblies to explain Kyushu Electric’s main safety arguments. Unlike the Fukushima Daiichi plant, the Genkai station does not sit near a fault line and is in a part of Japan that has not seen a large tsunami in more than 1,000 years of recorded history. Mayor Hideo Kishimoto of Genkai, where the plant is located, has already signaled his acceptance of a restart. He admitted that a big factor was Genkai’s economic dependence on the plant, whose taxes and subsidies provide two-thirds of the annual budget of some $100 million in the town of 6,400 people. “I think the economic worries are bigger in people’s minds here,” Mr. Kishimoto said. Town residents said they were afraid that an accident here could force the sort of evacuations that were ordered near the Fukushima Daiichi plant. However, they said they had no choice but to follow the mayor’s lead. “We know our lives are closely bound to the plant,” said Hiroyoshi Hidaka, 56, who owns a health products store in Genkai. “This has turned us into a town of silence.”",2011-07-03T01:48:07.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The state-owned French utility, the biggest nuclear energy producer in the world, will get control of eight British nuclear plant sites with potential for building reactors at a time when high energy prices and concerns about global warming are making nuclear power more attractive. France already generates most of its electricity from nuclear power, and Éléctricité de France is looking to expand operations abroad, notably in Britain, China, the United States and South Africa. Last week, the company confirmed a bid, in a joint venture with two private equity groups, for Constellation Energy of the United States. That proposal faces a rival offer from the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett. The British government, which owns nearly 36 percent of British Energy, is seeking more investment in atomic energy, hoping to rejuvenate its aging fleet of reactors to meet electricity needs while reducing carbon emissions. This would also allow it to move closer to fulfilling the demands of the Kyoto agreement on climate change. The deal is subject to approval by shareholders and regulators in Britain and Brussels, but analysts said approval seemed likely. The fund manager Invesco, a major shareholder that had played an instrumental part in delaying the deal during the summer, has agreed to accept the sweetened offer. It was not immediately clear whether another large shareholder, the fund manager M&G, had backed the deal. In the statement, Éléctricité de France said it was also holding discussions for Centrica, the owner of British Gas, to take a 25 percent stake in the new combined entity and to include Centrica in projects to build power stations. The move solidifies the trend of British power suppliers’ being controlled by foreign companies. RWE, the German utility, owns Npower, a major supplier, while Scottish Power is owned by the Spanish group Iberdrola. Analysts welcomed the deal, although some expressed concerns about the implications of the deal for Éléctricité de France’s credit ratings, particularly in light of the bid for Constellation. Speaking before the deal, Matthias Heck, a utility analyst at Sal. Oppenheim Jr. in Frankfurt, said the combination would have a “strong strategic rationale.” But the deal is not likely to be welcomed by all. Customers in Britain have been hit much harder by energy price increases than those in France and most other European countries, bringing complaints that British households are subsidizing their counterparts on the Continent. Based in Paris, Éléctricité de France operates 58 nuclear plants in France. Even before the deal, it generated about 6 percent of Britain’s energy. Through the deal, the company will benefit by acquiring access to land in Britain where it could expand. The government’s British Energy stake, worth around £4 billion, is earmarked for the government’s Nuclear Liability Fund, which was created to pay for the decommissioning and cleaning up of British Energy’s eight existing nuclear plants, when shutdowns of the sites begin in 2014. The government acquired its ownership in British Energy as part of its participation in a reorganization of the company five years ago. It originally took a stake of about 65 percent, but sold a little less than half of its holding a year ago, raising £2.3 billion for the Nuclear Liability Fund. Adrian Montague, chairman of British Energy, said the deal would allow the combined group to develop fully British Energy’s role in new nuclear construction and “improve British Energy’s financial strength and in so doing help create a secure, long-term future for our business and our staff.”",2008-09-24T12:50:19.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-world-business

Gregory Jaczko, the chairman of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, says the fallout threat is far greater than Japan is telling its citizens. This is not an issue that should be politicized. People’s health and welfare, perhaps their lives, are on the line, and what we need is truth, not politics! We need to know what is really happening and how great the threat is, if there is one. Louise Sheehy Fern Park, Fla., March 17, 2011  To the Editor: Nuclear engineers will likely be blamed for the cascading problems at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, but the fatal flaws of nuclear power in both Japan and the United States are due to factors beyond the reach of engineers: ¶The undue influence the nuclear industry exerts on regulators and elected officials. ¶Looming challenges worse than whatever worst-case scenarios are used as design thresholds. ¶Multiple units at one nuclear power facility (common practice in the United States), creating the potential for mind-boggling negative synergies — a serious problem at one unit vastly complicates management, salvage or use of the others. Better design, construction and management will not solve the problems with nuclear power because we cannot engineer away hubris, greed, unintended consequences, fraud, human error, disasters that exceed the design parameters and the long-term challenges of radioactive waste. Jono Miller Sarasota, Fla., March 17, 2011  To the Editor: Re “ U.S Nuclear Push May Be in Peril ” (front page, March 14): In light of recent events in Japan, the United States needs to start taking precautions with nuclear energy. While some, like Senator Mitch McConnell, believe that “we ought not to make American and domestic policy based upon an event that happened in Japan,” what happened there could happen anywhere. As a teenager, I would like to see the earth be here for future generations. I don’t dispute that we should be using nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels, but we need to be stricter about safety regulations. A nuclear meltdown would set back the environmental progress that we have made by decades. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman had the right idea when he suggested that we should “put the brakes on right now until we understand the ramifications of what’s happened in Japan.” Until the United States improves safety regulations for nuclear power plants, we should halt construction of new plants and relicensing of existing ones. Sophie Apple Brooklyn, March 17, 2011  To the Editor: Re “ Amid Shortages, a Surplus of Hope ,” by Ryu Murakami (Op-Ed, March 17): While I respect Mr. Murakami as a novelist of considerable talent, I was frankly disturbed by his essay. His attitude was nothing short of passivity and meek acceptance of the authorities in Japan. The devastation there is incomprehensible, and I can well understand his and the Japanese people’s shock, despair and feelings of helplessness. My heart goes out to everyone there. But the Japanese authorities so far have acted in an irresponsible, incompetent and destructive manner with regard to the nuclear crisis. Mr. Murakami’s resorting to hope as a way of dealing with the crisis shows an unwillingness to criticize the government or Tokyo Electric Power. This is the typical Japanese way. Japanese culture encourages and produces followers, not leaders. More than ever before Japan needs strong leadership, and it seems there is a vacuum.

Hundreds of demonstrators converged on the Seabrook Station nuclear power plant today to protest the plant's first atomic reaction, and the police said 627 were arrested for trespassing. The protesters, including children and handicapped people, were ushered into waiting buses and taken to police headquarters after climbing over a chain-link fence. They came to protest the first low-power nuclear reaction, which is scheduled for later this week. Swarms of protesters remained outside the gates in support of those who went in. They chanted, ''Shame on Bush'' and carried signs like ''In Mourning for the Late, Great State of New Hampshire,'' and ''Remember Chernobyl.'' ''It's going to keep the issue of nuclear power in the forefront,'' said Barbara C. French, a protester from Henniker, N.H. ''We have to send a message to New England, the rest of the country and the world,'' said Mrs. French, who was carrying a ''No Nukes'' poster. 'Very Vocal' Minority Ron Sher, a Seabrook spokesman, termed the demonstrators ''very vocal but a small minority.'' ''They don't represent the millions of people in New England that recognize that nuclear energy is a viable energy option,'' Mr. Sher said. Today's demonstration and a rally Saturday at nearby Hampton Beach State park were prompted by the recent granting by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of a license to Seabrook's owners to conduct tests. That will allow plant operators to start nuclear fission for the first time. Although the plant would still require a full-power license before it could operate commercially, the low-power test is a milestone for an installation that has been plagued by complications and delays for two decades. Since the late 1970's, there have been dozens of protests at the plant. The largest came in May 1977, when 1,414 protesters were arrested. After processing those arrested in today's demonstration, the police tonight gave their number as 627. Earlier, the number had been estimated at more than 650 by Capt. Sheldon P. Sullivan of the New Hampshire State Police and at at least 800 by Dianne Dunfy, a spokeswoman for the Clamshell Alliance, which has been a major organizer of protests against Seabrook over the years. Ms. Dunfy was among those arrested. Beginning about 2 P.M., demonstrators at four gates placed ladders over the fence surrounding the plant. For the next hour and a half, one by one they climbed over, young and old, organized into groups. Once inside, they walked toward the plant's interior, but several hundred yards into the plant grounds, they were met by state and local police and arrested. Captain Sullivan said there was no violence. The demonstrators were taken by school bus and other vehicles to the Seabrook police station, where they were issued summonses. In recent protests here, those arrested have been fined $100. Seabrook has been snarled in countless political tangles, regulatory snags, legal fights and cost overruns. There have been many days of protests and hundreds of arrests since August 1976, when what has been described as the nation's first group civil disobedience against a nuclear plant occurred here. Despite the opposition, the project has moved ahead with the support of influential people like John H. Sununu, former Governor of New Hampshire and now the White House chief of staff. ''Seabrook is obviously a very important resource,'' said William P. Sheperdson, a spokesman for the New England Power Pool, a regional consortium of 95 utilities based in West Springfield, Mass. The 1,150-megawatt plant could supply the power needs of one million New England homes, said Mr. Sher, a spokesman for New Hampshire Yankee, which operates the plant. Not only environmentalists have raised objections about the plant, however. Some New Hampshire businesses are worried that, should Seabrook begin operating, electric rates could go up substantially to help pay for it. And that could drive businesses from the state or deter others from coming, said John D. Crosier, president of the Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire, based in Concord. Construction of the Seabrook plant was completed in July 1986, 14 years after it was proposed by its majority owner, the Public Service Company of New Hampshire. The first proposal for a nuclear plant in the area was in 1968. In 1972, a new plan was announced for two reactors on marshland in Seabrook at a cost of $1 billion. But delays arising from environmental concerns stymied the project and after years of financial reverses and cost overruns, Public Service scrapped Seabrook Two. By the time Seabook One was finished, it had cost about $4.3 billion and threatened the solvency of Public Service. The company filed for bankruptcy in January 1988, the first electric utility to do so since the Depression. Similar to a Test Drive Seabrook received a license on May 26 permitting the nuclear reactor to operate at up to 5 percent of its power. That allows operators to test the reactor, as one might test-drive a new car at slow speeds. No electric power is generated in the process. Seabrook officials were elated over the low-power license and said a full-power license might follow later this year. Opponents said that was unlikely. For Seabrook to win a commercial license, they point out, evacuation plans for communities within 10 miles of the plant must receive Federal approval. The opponents plan to argue that no evacuation plan is safe, particularly in summer when nearby beaches are overflowing. The low-power testing began last weekend, with steam generators and coolant pipes being heated and pressurized. Inspectors from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are present during the testing, which will take about three weeks. Later this week, operators will start the nuclear chain reaction and for about a week will test the reactor's response to control devices. A five-day cooling period will follow.",1989-06-05T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

Saving the world from global warming may require sharp reductions in burning fuel, but there was no consensus at a two-day meeting here of 40 nuclear industry executives, government officials, energy experts and environmentalists on whether new nuclear reactors are needed. The highly unusual gathering was an attempt to determine the circumstances that would make a ''second age'' of reactors feasible, or whether the need for new nuclear plants would be precluded by conservation measures and the development of other energy sources. A picture emerged, however, of a future that is likely to have both conservation and more nuclear power, with the combination still not sufficient to prevent global warming. Spying an Opportunity The American nuclear industry has seized on scientists' belief that emissions from burning oil and coal are leading to catastrophic global warming, a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. Only a handful of reactors are still under construction, and more than 100 have been abandoned. But with refined designs and new procedures, the industry says, the time is ripe to build more. ''Nuclear energy people perceive the greenhouse effect as a fresh wind blowing at their back,'' said Stewart Udall, who was the Interior Secretary in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations and the organizer of the conference, which was sponsored by Robert Redford, the actor and environmentalist, who spoke briefly. But others who attended, like Peter Bradford, chairman of the New York State Public Service Commission, and Amory Lovins, a utility consultant and nationally recognized energy efficiency expert, said reactors were unlikely to be cost competitive. ''When we ask if nuclear power is in the national interest,'' said Charles Komanoff, an energy consultant in New York, ''we need to say, 'Compared to what?' '' Better Than Blackouts ''Compared to blackouts, I'd be willing to build reactors,'' Mr. Komanoff added. But conservation, he said, is far cheaper and more potent. Utility executives took a middle position. Although unenthusiastic about new reactors, they also seemed unwilling to foreclose such a choice at a time when environmental concerns might prevent construction of coal-powered plants. ''I see my principal option today as gas and oil, but I spent the 70's running from two embargoes,'' said John W. Ellis, chairman and chief executive of Puget Sound Power and Light, arguing that reactors should not be eliminated as an option. Howard P. Allen, chairman and chief executive of the Southern California Edison Company, noted that his company already has geothermal, solar and co-generation plants and a conservation program. ''I don't see how we're going to do anything to help global warming without doing something with nuclear in the next 20 years,'' he said. A new nuclear alternative emerged, in outline form, from representatives of Westinghouse Electric, General Electric and Combustion Engineering, which among them built almost all the reactors now in use in this country, and General Atomics, which is trying to sell a plant that has a new design. All four are talking about reactors that would be much smaller, simpler, cheaper, faster to build and more tolerant of operator error than the current generation. Full Design Comes First In addition, they would be designed in full before they were sold, in contrast to the 112 plants now licensed. These were ordered by the utilities and given construction permits when they were only about 25 percent designed. That, combined with changing regulations, made price estimates little better than guesses. Under the current system, which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, reactor manufacturers and Congress are working to change, reactor orders have dried up. ''Today, if anyone suggested a new reactor to a utility board, they would send for the guy with the net,'' said Shelby T. Brewer, president of the nuclear division of Combustion Engineering Inc. and a former Assistant Energy Secretary. But the reactor makers have high hopes for their new plants. ''If our environmental friends and our previously anti-nuclear friends look at it with us, I think they're going to like it,'' said Dr. Bertram Wolfe, vice president and general manager of General Electric Nuclear Energy. Richard J. Slember, Dr. Wolfe's counterpart at Westinghouse, suggested a program to build two or three new reactors, ''starting over, with a clean sheet of paper,'' to demonstrate what was possible. The investment would be modest compared with the knowledge to be gained, he said. ''It's like a couple of Stealth bombers.'' Blue Jeans and Plaid Shirts In an intense debate that was conducted in formal sessions and over dining tables, all parties sought allies. The participants, wearing blue jeans and plaid shirts, pulled out graphs and slides to make their points. ''The major trend throughout the world is for greater and greater concern over the environment,'' said Russel W. Peterson, president emeritus of the National Audubon Society and former Governor of Delaware. ''With that kind of climate, to envision that we're going to change public opinion by changing the design and regulation of reactors is naive.'' Building reactors, he said, would distract the world from the essential task, conservation. Alvin M. Weinberg, a member of the Manhattan Project team that built the first reactor ever, said, ''I'm deeply disappointed in this outcome of the conference.'' Nuclear power will not return, he said, unless a ''skeptical elite'' of environmentalists and regulators persuaded the public. ''It's up to the skeptical elite to tell us in the nuclear community what it is we have to do,'' he added. Kenneth M. Carr, chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and a retired admiral, noted, ''You haven't got a lot of open minds left.'' He added, ''It's obvious that the environmental community is never going to come around until they are convinced there is no alternative.'' Emissions Hard to Pinpoint It was also clear, however, that many participants did not think enough was known now to say if the greenhouse effect justifies a return to nuclear power. One issue, raised by Dr. Weinberg, is that scientists cannot pinpoint the level of carbon dioxide emissions that alters the climate. Another issue is what the competing technologies will be in the second or third decade of the next century. Some said nuclear power's main competition might be solar power. In the next few weeks, several reactor manufacturers will seek to have designs approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but the number of operating reactors will decline steadily, with retirements outpacing completions. Another participant, Representative Phil Sharp, Democrat of Indiana, predicted little action from Washington. ''You're not going to see the Congress or the President say, 'Just say yes to nuclear power,' '' he said. But he too was looking for a blueprint from the conference. ''If you could come to an intellectual consensus, we'd implement it like that,'' he said, with a snap of his fingers.",1989-10-23T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business
da2e6f94-d581-4fda-ab02-7f9ccb964782,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/world/asia/22nuclear.html,"Japan Extended Reactor’s Life, Despite Warning","TOKYO — Just a month before a powerful earthquake and tsunami crippled the Fukushima Daiichi plant at the center of Japan’s nuclear crisis, government regulators approved a 10-year extension for the oldest of the six reactors at the power station despite warnings about its safety. The regulatory committee reviewing extensions pointed to stress cracks in the backup diesel-powered generators at Reactor No. 1 at the Daiichi plant, according to a summary of its deliberations that was posted on the Web site of Japan’s nuclear regulatory agency after each meeting. The cracks made the engines vulnerable to corrosion from seawater and rainwater. The generators are thought to have been knocked out by the tsunami, shutting down the reactor’s vital cooling system. The Tokyo Electric Power Company, which runs the plant, has since struggled to keep the reactor and spent fuel pool from overheating and emitting radioactive materials. Several weeks after the extension was granted, the company admitted that it had failed to inspect 33 pieces of equipment related to the cooling systems, including water pumps and diesel generators, at the power station’s six reactors, according to findings published on the agency’s Web site shortly before the earthquake. Regulators said that “maintenance management was inadequate” and that the “quality of inspection was insufficient.” Less than two weeks later, the earthquake and tsunami set off the crisis at the power station. The decision to extend the reactor’s life, and the inspection failures at all six reactors, highlight what critics describe as unhealthy ties between power plant operators and the Japanese regulators that oversee them. Expert panels like the one that recommended the extension are drawn mostly from academia to backstop bureaucratic decision-making and rarely challenge the agencies that hire them. Because public opposition to nuclear power makes it hard to build new power plants, nuclear operators are lobbying to extend their reactors’ use beyond the 40-year statutory limit, despite uneven safety records and a history of cover-ups. The government, eager to expand the use of nuclear energy and reduce the reliance on imported fossil fuels, has been largely sympathetic. Such extensions are also part of a global trend in which aging plants have been granted longer lives. Over the next decade in Japan, 13 more reactors — and the other 5 at the Fukushima Daiichi plant — will also turn 40, raising the prospect of gargantuan replacement costs. That is one reason critics contend that the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency’s committee in charge of inspecting aging nuclear power plants may play down its own findings. In approving the extension in early February, regulators told Tokyo Electric to monitor potential damage from radiation to the reactor’s pressure vessel, which holds fuel rods; corrosion of the spray heads used to douse the suppression chamber; corrosion of key bolts at the reactor; and conduction problems in a gauge that measures the flow of water into the reactor, according to a report published in early February. The committee, which convened six times to review findings gathered during inspections of the No. 1 unit at the power station, found that Tokyo Electric had met all required protections from earthquakes. Inspectors, however, had spent just three days inspecting the No. 1 unit, a period that industry experts say was far too brief because assessing the earthquake risk to a nuclear plant is one of the most complex engineering problems in the world. Despite these doubts, the committee recommended that Tokyo Electric be given permission to run the No. 1 unit, which was built by General Electric and began operating in 1971, for an additional decade. During the approval process, the company claimed that the reactor was capable of running for 60 years. Mitsuhiko Tanaka, an engineer who worked on the design of the reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, said the reactors there were outdated, particularly their small suppression chambers, which increased the risk that pressure would build up within the reactor, a fault eliminated in newer reactors. Since the tsunami, officials at Fukushima Daiichi have tried to relieve rising pressure inside the reactors, several times resorting to releasing radioactive steam into the atmosphere, a measure that in turn has contributed to the contamination of food and water in the area. “It was about time the reactor was replaced,” Mr. Tanaka said. “The tsunami would have caused great damage, regardless. But the pipes, the machinery, the computers, the entire reactors — they are just old, and that did not help.” Somewhat younger reactors, Nos. 2, 3, and 4, also suffered extensive damage. Regulators approved the 10-year extension even though aging reactors at Tokyo Electric, as well as those at other power companies, had suffered a series of problems as far back as a decade ago. Attempts to cover them up and manipulate data, particularly by Tokyo Electric, the country’s biggest utility, underscored not only the problems of the nuclear industry but also Japan’s weakness in regulating it. The company has admitted wrongdoing. A Tokyo Electric spokesman, Naoki Tsunoda, said: “We are committed to carrying out proper inspections in the future. We will study why this has happened and endeavor to inform the public.” In 2000, a whistle-blower at a separate company that was contracted to inspect the reactors told regulators about cracks in the stainless steel shrouds that cover reactor cores at Fukushima’s Daiichi plant. But regulators simply told the company to look into the issue, allowing the reactors to keep operating. Nuclear regulators effectively sat on the information about the cracks in the shrouds, said Eisaku Sato, the governor of Fukushima Prefecture at the time and an opponent of nuclear power. He said the prefecture itself and the communities hosting the nuclear plants did not learn about the cracks until regulators publicized them in 2002, more than two years after the whistle-blower reported the cracks. In 2003, regulators forced Tokyo Electric to suspend operations at its 10 reactors at two plants in Fukushima and 7 reactors in Niigata Prefecture after whistle-blowers gave information to Fukushima Prefecture showing that the company had falsified inspection records and hid flaws over 16 years to save on repair costs. In the most serious incident, Tokyo Electric hid the large cracks in the shrouds. “An organization that is inherently untrustworthy is charged with ensuring the safety of Japan’s nuclear plants,” said Mr. Sato, governor from 1988 to 2006. “So the problem is not limited to Tokyo Electric, which has a long history of cover-ups, but it’s the whole system that is flawed. That’s frightening.” Like many critics of Japan’s nuclear industry, Mr. Sato attributed weak oversight to a conflict of interest that he said essentially stripped the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency of its effectiveness. The agency, which is supposed to act as a watchdog, is under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which has a general policy of encouraging the development of Japan’s nuclear industry. The ministry and the agency, in turn, share cozy ties with Tokyo Electric and other operators — some of which offer lucrative jobs to former ministry officials in a practice known as “amakudari,” or descent from heaven. “They’re all birds of a feather,” Mr. Sato, 71, said in an interview at his home in Koriyama, in Fukushima Prefecture. The Japan Nuclear Energy Safety Organization , which is supposed to provide a second layer of scrutiny, is understaffed and largely an advisory group. Masatoshi Toyoda, a former vice president at Tokyo Electric who, among other jobs, ran the company’s nuclear safety division, said the organization should be strengthened. The United States had a similar setup until the 1970s, when Congress broke up the old Atomic Energy Commission into the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. “Like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the United States, they should have full-time engineers who should check the safety of power plants,” Mr. Toyoda said. “I’ve been telling the government that the system should be changed, but any changes to Japan’s nuclear policy take a long time.” Hidehiko Nishiyama, deputy director general of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, said that “there are no problems with the current safety setup.” He added that the extension of the life of Reactor No. 1 “was approved on the understanding that any problems found would be fixed by Tokyo Electric.” But critics say the approval process for extending the lifespan of reactors is fraught with problems. Limited amounts of information are disclosed before approval is granted. The government reviews only reports submitted by utilities, and does not conduct its own tests to determine whether those reports are true, according to Chihiro Kamisawa, a nuclear safety researcher at the Citizens’ Nuclear Information Center, Japan’s most vocal nuclear watchdog. “They are stretching the limit,” Mr. Kamisawa said.",2011-03-22T03:22:15.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The industry is doing better now, but ironically extinction is in sight. Today, reactors are quietly producing about one-quarter more electricity each, and the level of radiation exposure to workers is down along with the number of automatic shut-downs. Uranium fuel is cheap and plentiful, and, with low interest rates, so is nuclear power's biggest ingredient, capital. The industry has also happily achieved a lowered public profile. ''And everything seems to be falling apart,'' Michael L. Corradini, a professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Wisconsin, said sadly. The nuclear industry will be around for years to come, but seems to have peaked in terms of the number of working reactors and their share of power generated nationally. No reactors are being built; the last ordered were Palo Verde 1, 2 and 3 in Arizona in October, 1973, the month the Arab oil embargo began. Since then there has been an energy revolution, but it wasn't nuclear. A barrel of oil, which has roughly enough energy to run a small house for a month, sold for $12 then; by 1979 it was $40. Today it is back down around $12. These gyrations upward lured utility companies into nuclear decisions that now look ridiculous. For example, Millstone 3 reactor in Waterford, Conn., was far over budget during construction in the late 1970's. Even after the incident at Three Mile Island, consultants said it was still worthwhile to finish Millstone if oil averaged $96 a barrel over the reactor's lifetime. The Energy Information Administration, part of the Energy Department, predicted that the price would be $100 by the turn of the century. But oil is now about a 10th of that. Reactors are a bit like the Concordes, the supersonic transport planes that first flew a few days before the Three Mile Island accident, or the Apollo moon rockets, which made the last of their flights to the moon a few years before. They are technological artifacts of an era slipping into history. Cloning the best practices from one utility to another, policing each other, getting more output from the reactors, the industry essentially adopted the Greenpeace motto: a nuclear accident anywhere is a nuclear accident everywhere. It vowed to have no more meltdowns. Not counting the 1986 catastrophe at Chernobyl, where the nuclear reactors are of a different design, the industry has so far succeeded. BUT not everyone agrees that the industry's performance is greatly improved. James P. Riccio, a nuclear expert at Critical Mass, a Washington-based nonprofit organization affiliated with Ralph Nader, said that the plants operated more now because the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had shortened the list of equipment that had to be in perfect working order for them to run, and the number of automatic shut-downs has declined because the number of manual shut-downs is up. ''They've gotten more intelligent about what they're doing,'' he said, ''but then again, they've had to.'' There have been other changes in the last 20 years. If two decades ago nuclear power seemed forbidding and secret, today anyone can log on to Nuclear Regulatory Commission Web site, which offers detailed specifications for each reactor (http:// www.nrc.gov/AEOD/pib/pib.html). For Three Mile Island unit 1, the undamaged twin of the reactor that had the meltdown, the data includes the identification numbers stamped on the water pumps. Another table for Three Mile Island shows the temperatures and pressures at which the emergency systems will automatically start, with different numbers depending on how many coolant pumps are running. But elsewhere technology is accelerating, too. Natural gas has become cheaper to find and recover, and the system for turning it into electricity has improved steadily. The newest plants produce twice as many kilowatt-hours from a thousand cubic feet as the ones that nuclear power was competing with in 1979. The real reactor killer, according to Professor Corradini and others, is something that was not thought of in 1979 -- deregulation in the the utility industry. Nationwide, power companies are fissioning into companies that will distribute electricity and sell it to consumers (like local phone companies) and other companies that will generate power and compete to sell it (like long distance carriers). THE companies that built the 104 reactors still operating ordered them in the 1960's and early 1970's. Asked then which source of power would be the cheapest in the next few decades, they had guessed nuclear, knowing that if they were off by a few tenths of a cent per kilowatt-hour, the consumer would pay or reap the difference. Now, if they are asked the question at all, they say natural gas. Today they are building nothing and buying power from independent producers, none of whom seems inclined to place a multi-billion-dollar bet on a reactor where the output might be uncompetitive in 2010, or 2020 or 2030, for that matter. ''The investment risk changed,'' said James K. Joosten, a nuclear engineer and consultant and former official of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of industrialized nations. ''In old days, people used to talk about nuclear power in religious terms, and say, 'It's good and we need to do it and if the public doesn't buy into it, we'll make them buy into it.' Realistically, today it's a business decision.'' By Mr. Joosten's estimate, if electricity is completely deregulated, the market price will be about 2 cents per kilowatt-hour at the wholesale level, a price that about 28 nuclear plants cannot achieve. And if some states offer a one-time payment to their utilities because they have to close such plants in the transition to deregulation, then some reactor owners with marginal plants will jump at that offer while they can get it.

Agency Says","Image Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in Kyiv on Thursday. Credit... Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The Ukrainian employees who operate a Russian-occupied nuclear power plant on the war’s front lines are facing “unacceptable pressure” to sign employment contracts with a Russian state-owned company, the head of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog said on Friday. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been under Russian control since March. But Ukrainian staff have continued working there — many of them by force, Ukraine says — even as a battle for control of the area has raged. Russian shelling has occasionally cut the facility off from the power grid that is used to cool its reactors, raising fears of a nuclear accident. Russia said last week that it planned to nationalize the plant, the largest in Europe. But Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in response that the agency still viewed the plant as a Ukrainian facility because the U.N. charter does not recognize illegal annexations. Zaporizhzhia is one of the four regions that President Vladimir V. Putin illegally declared part of Russia in recent weeks. The agency said in a statement on Friday that the Russian nuclear power operator, Rosatom, had been pressuring Ukrainian employees at the plant to sign an employment contract as a condition for keeping their jobs, and that Ukraine’s nuclear operator has urged them not to. Mr. Grossi traveled to Russia and Ukraine this week for talks about establishing a safety zone around the plant. The statement said that he had discussed the “increasingly difficult and challenging work conditions” at the plant during his meetings with Russian and Ukrainian officials. “I made clear that the staff must be allowed to carry out their vital tasks without undue interference or pressure,” Mr. Grossi said, according to the statement. Neither Rosatom nor the Ukrainian operator, Energoatom, could be reached for comment early Saturday. In a Facebook post on Friday, Energoatom praised the plant’s employees for maintaining the plant’s security despite Russian pressure. On a few occasions this year, Russian shelling has forced the Zaporizhzhia plant to rely on diesel generators to power safety equipment. The availability of fuel to power those generators has long been a concern. When external power was restored to the plant last weekend, nearly two days after Russian shelling had forced it offline, Mr. Grossi called the development “temporary relief in a still untenable situation.”",2022-10-15T11:47:07.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Cape Cod Bay vu. 26 years old. Original owner. Good condition. The property that was put on the market last summer was a nuclear plant -- the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station here -- and that alone might have made it a tough sell. For one, nuclear energy has been very unpopular since the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island. And the opening of electricity markets in states like Massachusetts adds to the financial risks of running a nuclear plant: the costs of plant shutdowns, for instance, can no longer be passed along, with the blessing of regulators, to customers. And the operator no longer has a monopoly. For these reasons, Pilgrim's owner, the Boston Edison Company, said that if a buyer could not be found, the plant would be shut and decommissioned sooner rather than later. For Plymouth, a town of nearly 50,000 and the home of Plymouth Rock, the loss of its biggest employer would have been a huge blow. So the 670 managers and employees of the Pilgrim plant were understandably nervous when teams of executives from other utility companies toured the plant to see if they wanted to make a bid. The floors and walls of the plant glistened; the telephones were even polished by hand. Some of the maintenance and operating workers wore ties and dress shirts for a time. ''Until a buyer was found, you did not know what the future held,'' recalled Frank Clifford, a service reactor operator at Pilgrim. While the offers did not exactly pour in, two bids were eventually made for the plant. The Entergy Corporation, a huge utility based in New Orleans, was the winner with an $80 million bid. It was just the second sale of a nuclear plant in the United States. It's a buyers' market, but the fact that there is a market at all in nuclear plants is a sign of how deregulation is reshaping the power industry. Entergy and companies like the Peco Energy Company and Dominion Resources are in the forefront of a group of bargain basement shoppers who see remaining value in nuclear energy. Instead of spending hundreds of millions of dollars or more to build a new power plant capable of generating the same amount of electricity, they are able to buy older nuclear plants for tens of millions -- a mere fraction of their book value. (The last reactor to be built in the United States was ordered in 1973.) These companies, which own more than one nuclear plant, say they have developed the skill and size to run nuclear plants more efficiently. The possibility of costly operating shutdowns does not frighten them, they say, because they will have the expertise, manpower and equipment available should a problem arise. And the price is so cheap that it pays to deal with the generally higher costs of operating nuclear power plants compared with that of running other electricity sources. Nuclear plants in newly open markets like Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Jersey are particularly attractive. Under deregulation, a number of the utilities in those states are shrinking to become transmission companies. They will concentrate on the delivery of electricity and on servicing business and residential customers. Utilities like the Consolidated Edison Company of New York, for example, will buy power at the lowest price from pools where companies like Entergy, Dominion and Peco will sell power. The buyers of nuclear plants contend they can thrive in such open markets. When the plants are run well, they can compete on price with low-cost plants that run on hydropower, coal and natural gas. And local nuclear plants are particularly attractive compared with power plants outside the region, which face more expensive transmission costs. ''People who are buying the nuclear plants are very smart,'' said Robert Rubin, a utility analyst with Bear, Stearns. Despite the image of nuclear power as an industry with no future, he said, it still has many years of life yet. Entergy, which will have five nuclear plants once the Pilgrim acquisition closes, has identified nuclear generation as having tremendous potential. Many utilities, however, especially those with only one nuclear plant, see only potential liabilities. At the same time, regulators in Massachusetts and elsewhere have been pushing utilities to dispose of their generation plants to help open the market to competition. For those utilities that are transforming themselves into transmission companies, state regulators often make allowances for their nuclear plants because of the uncertainty over whether there would be buyers. But most utilities have not needed much prodding to sell. Mr. Rubin estimates that 25 to 30 plants will soon be put on the market and will either change hands or be shut. In a decade, he predicted, most of the nation's 103 operating reactors will be owned by just a handful of companies. In what may be the next such deal, the two units of the Nine Mile Point nuclear plant, which employs 1,350 workers, are up for sale. The Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation of Syracuse owns one unit. A consortium of utilities, which includes Niagara Mohawk, owns the other. They are in negotiations with Amergen, a joint venture formed by Peco Energy, a utility based in Philadelphia, and British Energy of Edinburgh, one of Britain's largest generators of electricity. The fate of the plant, on the shores of Lake Ontario, is causing apprehension in Scriba, N.Y., a town of about 8,000. ''Is the new owner going to be a good citizen in our community?'' asked Norman Seiter, a lawyer for the town board of Scriba. The two units pay about 85 percent of the property taxes of the town and 39 percent of Oswego County's taxes. If the units are sold, as expected, for less than their book values, the town would be under pressure to reduce the plant's valuation sharply, causing property tax revenues from the operations to fall. In July, Amergen was the buyer in the first nuclear plant sale in the United States, agreeing to acquire the functioning unit of Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, the site of the nation's worst nuclear accident. The seller was GPU Inc., a utility that serves parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Amergen has also received the exclusive right to negotiate an agreement to buy the Vermont Yankee Nuclear plant in Vernon, Vt., owned by a group of 13 New England utilities. But not every nuclear plant put on the market will end up with a buyer. Some plants have been so ridden with problems or have such complex ownership and regulatory hurdles that they are likely to be decommissioned early because they cannot be counted on to offer reliable power at competitive prices. Last year, GPU, for example, tried to sell its Oyster Creek plant, situated about 35 miles north of Atlantic City, but talks broke down, and it was going to be shut. Now, the sales of the Three Mile Island unit and the Pilgrim plant have encouraged GPU to make another effort to find a buyer for Oyster Creek. Peco had looked at the Maine Yankee plant in Wiscasset, Me., but backed off. The plant will be shut for good. The prospect of a permanent shutdown worries people in Scriba the most. ''We want these plants to stay here and keep operating,'' Mr. Seiter said. If buyers are not found, he noted, ''we will still have a nuclear site in our backyard with the waste being stored for some time.'' As more nuclear plants come on the market or are decommissioned, similar concerns are likely to be felt by dozens of communities. For Boston Edison, a subsidiary of BEC Energy, the decision that its one nuclear plant would not be a part of its future was made after a review two years ago. The utility decided that Pilgrim should be run by a company that had a number of such plants and could take advantage of economies of scale, said Carl Gustin, the senior vice president for corporate communications at Boston Edison. ''It was the best way for Pilgrim to keep operating in the future to have an owner committed to nuclear power,'' he said. Entergy got a bargain, industry analysts say. Of its total bid of $80 million, $67 million was for nuclear fuel. This meant that in effect Entergy paid only $13 million for a plant whose book value is about $700 million. A trust fund of $466 million to offset the cost of decommissioning, whenever that should be needed, is also being passed along to Entergy. The company bought the Pilgrim plant at a time it was running at 97 percent of its capacity and producing 670 megawatts of power -- enough to serve a small city. But the plant has been troubled in the past. For a time, it had one of the worst operating records in the nation. In 1986, the plant was already under criticism from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission when it suffered two shutdowns because of equipment problems. Pilgrim remained shut for two years while it underwent an extensive overhaul. Adm. Ralph G. Bird, an outside expert with a background in nuclear submarines, took charge and put in new management and tightened operations and safety procedures. Entergy has succeeded in turning around other troubled plants. Two of its plants, Arkansas Nuclear One and River Bend in Louisiana had particularly poor operating records in the late 1980's. The plants, which had been operating at as low as 60 percent of capacity, have been operating at an 88 percent level recently. ''You are taking a risk when you assume these assets,'' Mike Bellamy, the vice president for operations at Pilgrim for Entergy Nuclear said. ''If they are run well and you buy them at a good price, the opportunity is there to make a nice profit.'' In Plymonth, the sale of Pilgrim Nuclear ''has brought real mixed feelings,'' said Robert Bradley, the office manager at the Pilgrim Sands Motel, whose house overlooks the plant. ''There have been times when people were real nervous and wanted it shut down. It has also been a real financial boon to the town.'' Indeed, the plant was warmly greeted when it opened in 1972. Thousands of the town's residents, many of them Italian and Portuguese immigrants, had once worked for the Plymouth Cordage Company, the world's largest rope maker. There were also several textile mills. But nylon and other materials replaced the Plymouth-made ropes, which were made from hemp, and the last mill closed in the mid-1950's. Entergy is not expected to make major changes at the plant, Mr. Bellamy of Pilgrim said, adding that earlier job cuts had left the plant with a lean and efficient work force. Still, workers and managers may have to change their way of thinking in a newly competitive industry. Employees had the attitude that ''Mother Boston Edison will take care of me,'' said Cristine Maimaron, a manager and an important member of the marketing team that sold the plant. ''It was hard to make the break.''",1999-03-06T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business

Windmills look promising but still produce only a tiny amount of power; solar power is even less significant. Nuclear reactors are now so desirable that when old ones go on sale, bidding wars have broken out. And the Bush administration's energy plan, scheduled for release soon, is expected to include strong support for new reactor construction. Does that mean it is time to order new ones? Not quite, according to a number of experts gathered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology here to talk about the role of technology in a time of growing electric demand and increased concern about pollution. But after a 30-year hiatus, the time may be drawing closer. ''There's some change in the wind,'' said Charles M. Vest, president of M.I.T., helping to open a two-day International Symposium on the Role of Nuclear Energy in a Sustainable Environment, sponsored by the university's Center for Advanced Nuclear Systems. Experts from France, Japan, Russia and the United States discussed designs that might be feasible in 30 years, or in 3 years. The group acknowledged obvious problems, like the fact that this country has still not decided what to do with reactor waste, but presumed that either a burial spot would be found or plants would be built to break down the waste or reuse it. The industry's trade association, the Nuclear Energy Institute, has assembled a task force on new nuclear deployment, which has met four times to draw up a business plan for new reactors. Participants include five companies that either operate or have recently bought plants -- Dominion Resources of Virginia, Entergy of New Orleans, Exelon of Chicago, Constellation Energy of Maryland and the Southern Company of Georgia. Industry executives say that the first new order for a reactor, if it comes, is likely to be at a site where other plants are already operating and the neighbors are used to a nuclear installation. As for what a new plant might look like, a great deal has changed since 1973, when the last plant that was not later canceled was ordered, and even since 1996, when the last one was finished. Experts say the designs or construction techniques of the 1970's are no more likely to return than other wonders of that era, like the Boeing 727 or the Saturn V rocket. One possibility is the ''pebble bed'' design, which circulates uranium fuel pellets shaped like billiard balls through the reactor and generates only about one-tenth as much heat per square foot as a conventional reactor. As a result, supporters assert that it cannot have a meltdown. The fuel balls in the pebble bed design are replaced as needed, but the reactor never has to shut down for refueling. The Exelon Corporation, which owns 17 reactors in this country, joined a partnership with a South African utility, Eskom, another South African company and BNFL, formerly known as British Nuclear Fuels, to build one in South Africa. Exelon has asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to look at this design, but has not announced plans to build one in the United States. Other possible new designs range from simplified, refined versions of the Westinghouse and General Electric models in service today to the pebble bed. The regulatory commission approved new Westinghouse and General Electric designs in the late 1990's, and that, in itself, is a change; designs for the current generation of plants were not approved until the plants were built, sometimes leading to licensing delays. The nuclear division of Westinghouse, now owned by BNFL, says that its design has 60 percent fewer moving parts -- with fewer pumps, wires and pipes -- and that there is less to build and less to go wrong. It also has stairs in places where older designs had ladders, to accommodate an aging nuclear power plant work force. A new General Electric design is also meant to be simpler and safer. In 1996 a utility in Japan completed a reactor that resembled the design approved by American regulators. But other changes since the 1970's do not bode well for new reactor construction. In those days, the utilities that built generating stations were regulated monopolies that could take on large projects with the assurance that their customers would pay the price almost no matter what it was. ''Somebody else was paying for your mistakes,'' said David Lochbaum, a nuclear reactor expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit safety group, who did not attend the meeting here. Now, most power plants are built by unregulated suppliers that could be bankrupted by the cost overruns that were common when the last of the 103 reactors still running were completed. The unregulated companies prefer plants that can be put up quickly, with less financial risk. Nuclear waste is a more pressing problem than when the first plants were built. California, for example, has made it illegal to begin new reactors until the waste problem is solved. In every state, that will be an argument. The Energy Department was supposed to begin accepting spent fuel from reactors in 1998, but work on its proposed permanent repository, Yucca Mountain, near Las Vegas, has been slow. So far scientists have not ruled on its suitability. In addition, there are promising competitors, including windmills and fuel cells. Even though President Bush's budget proposes cuts in money available to research alternative forms of energy, many researchers are pursuing new technologies. And energy planners have been wrong for decades in prematurely predicting the end of oil, gas and coal. ''When everybody in this room dies, fossil fuels are going to be abundant and inexpensive,'' said Michael W. Golay, a nuclear engineering professor here, to a gathering of about 40 nuclear experts. Supporters say that with improved reliability and design, the new generation of reactors will be less expensive to operate than the competing sources of electricity, coal and natural gas. But the numbers remain somewhat speculative. Still, the industry is getting a second look, for some of the same reasons nuclear power seemed attractive in the 1960's and 70's. Supporters argue that fossil fuel supplies are limited, that the United States should be developing technology to help the world electrify, and that pollution, especially emissions linked to global climate change, is a concern. Still, the industry was not helped by Mr. Bush's decision to drop the Kyoto accord on limiting carbon dioxide emissions. But another recent development has helped: the rise in the price of natural gas. About 90 percent of the plants built in the last 10 years use natural gas, but in California last winter, the price of that fuel reached $60 per million British thermal units, equivalent to oil at about $350 a barrel, or about seven times the current price, and some analysts expect it to stay in the range of $4 to $6 per million B.T.U., up from $2 to $3 a year ago. In response, some companies have announced plans to build coal-burning plants, but these require costly pollution controls, and even then, they will emit sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which cause acid rain and smog. The plants also produce carbon dioxide, which may eventually be regulated as a contributor to global climate change. Environmental advocates call for investments in efficiency, and in ''renewable'' sources like wind and solar, but so far those sources are tiny compared with demand. The Chernobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine was 15 years ago, and Three Mile Island was 22 years ago; meanwhile, American reactors are operating with a record low level of minor incidents, and producing more power than ever. Plants are having their 40-year licenses extended for 20 years. The result, said Paul Jaskow, a former chairman of the economics department at M.I.T. and an expert on regulated industries, is that ''there has not been a better time for nuclear power in the last 25 years.'' But Mr. Jaskow, analyzing the recent power plant sales and separating the components, like long-term power purchase agreements, trust funds for reactor decommissioning, and sale of nuclear fuel, concluded, that ''none of these deals even comes close to covering the book costs.'' ''You couldn't justify paying $2,000 or $3,000 per kilowatt for those plants,'' he said, referring to the price per unit capacity. Supporters say they could build plants for about $1,000 per kilowatt of capacity, but similar claims in the 1960's and 70's were way off, and nearly bankrupted some utilities. The regulatory commission has simplified the licensing procedure, to reduce the possibility of lengthy delays, but industry experts are skeptical because the new procedure has not been used. Investors would have to expect a huge competitive benefit from nuclear plants to risk putting money in a new one, Mr. Jaskow said, ''because of the significant possibility of coming up with a dry hole.'' Correction: April 28, 2001, Saturday An article in Business Day on Tuesday about a resurgence of interest in nuclear power included a company erroneously among members of a task force on new nuclear deployment set up by the industry's trade association, the Nuclear Energy Institute. Constellation Energy of Maryland is not a member. The article also misspelled the surname of a former economics chairman at M.I.T. who said this was a good time for nuclear power. He is Paul L.

Tass said that several countries and organizations had expressed sympathy after the accident at the Chernobyl atomic power station in the Ukraine and had offered aid, and that the Soviet Government was grateful. ''However,'' Tass continued, ''it turns out that the first nuclear power station accident in the entire history of the Soviet nuclear power industry can be used for fouling up the international atmosphere with political radioactivity, for attempts at blackmailing the Soviet Union, for blackening the image of socialism, its science and policy.'' ''This is the way some high-ranking officials in Washington and some Western European capitals acted. With their sanction a truly unprecedented propaganda hysteria started these days,'' Tass added. ''It is using allegations about 'thousands of dead,' the 'inability of Soviet specialists to localize the source of radioactive radiation,' about an 'exodus of foreign nationals from the U.S.S.R.,' etc.'' 'Anti-Soviet Hysteria' The commentary was part of a sharp escalation of Soviet assertions that the West has exploited the Chernobyl accident to ''whip up anti-Soviet hysteria.'' Tass has published dozens of dispatches either assailing Western reports on the accident or detailing nuclear accidents in the West. Tass asserted that while the meeting in Tokyo was the 12th gathering of the leaders of the seven major capitalist nations, it was the first to discuss the safety of nuclear power stations, even though there had been many accidents in the West.

But she is having difficulty finding consensus even within her own government on a new energy policy, especially on the most contentious issue: the future of Germany’s nuclear plants. Governments around the globe are seeking cleaner ways to generate power and trying to reduce their dependence on foreign oil and natural gas at the same time. And most countries are deciding they cannot do without nuclear energy, at least in the immediate future. But in Germany, citizens are less sure about whether nuclear power should be part of the solution to combat climate change. With electricity demand expected to grow only slowly, opponents argue that keeping the country’s 17 nuclear power plants going in the years ahead would detract from the effort to develop other renewable sources of energy. Indeed, the cabinet agreed this month to an action plan to have energy from solar, wind and other renewable sources represent 20 percent of energy consumption by 2020, up from 10 percent now. Supporters argue that nuclear power, which provides 11 percent of Germany’s total energy mix and an average of 26 percent of its electricity, is a reliable and relatively inexpensive part of the energy mix that should not be abandoned if the country is going to meet its needs. The German public is split evenly. A survey by Forsa, an independent polling institute, published last month in Stern magazine found that 46 percent of Germans favored extending the life of reactors and 46 percent wanted them shut down. The changed economic landscape is also influencing the difficult balancing act as the government struggles to draft its new energy policy, which is to be presented next month. Mrs. Merkel, a physicist and former environment minister, was lauded by the German news media in 2007 for getting George W. Bush to agree to a compromise on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. But when the United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen convened two years later in the midst of a global recession, she failed to persuade President Obama — and China and India — to accept the European Union’s ambitious position on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Now some German leaders want Mrs. Merkel to reclaim the initiative for Europe by setting even more ambitious goals at home. But others caution against making demands that could endanger the economic recovery that has just taken hold in Germany — led by export-driven, energy-intensive heavy industries. “Merkel wants to demonstrate that she still is committed to reducing greenhouse gases,” said Claudia Kemfert, an energy specialist at the economic research institute DIW in Berlin. “But no matter which energy sector she looks at, she is confronted by powerful lobbies.” In 2002, the previous government, led by a coalition of Social Democrats and Greens, passed a law requiring that all German nuclear power stations be closed by 2022 and not be replaced. Mrs. Merkel did not dare question that law during her first term, when she shared power with the Social Democrats. The more business-friendly Free Democrats, her coalition partners since last October, have a different approach. The party leader, Guido Westerwelle, who is also the foreign minister, said this month that he wanted the life of the nuclear power plants to be prolonged. He even supported the coal industry provided that production was “cleaner, modern and more efficient.” Mrs. Merkel and her Christian Democrats have yet to take a firm position but are generally considered sympathetic to extending the life of the nuclear plants. The Christian Democrats’ small sister party in Bavaria, the Christian Social Union, is adamant that they remain open. Yet at the Environment Ministry, Norbert Röttgen, a Christian Democrat, has upset many of his fellow conservatives by questioning the need for extending the life of the nuclear power plants. At the same time, Mr. Röttgen is pushing the European Union to unilaterally commit to reducing carbon dioxide emissions 30 percent by 2020 from levels in 1990, up from the current pledge of 20 percent. But Mrs. Merkel is no longer convinced that Europe can go it alone after that proposal was defeated in Copenhagen. As she reconsiders what role Europe can convincingly play, the prospect of reopening of the nuclear issue has drawn the interest of energy companies. Jürgen Grossmann, chief executive of RWE, one of the biggest energy companies in Germany, insists that the country could not survive without nuclear power, which he argues is safe, clean and inexpensive. Electric companies in Germany, as in most European Union countries, are obliged to buy electricity generated from renewable sources produced by individuals and companies. In some cases, that energy is heavily subsidized, and Mrs. Merkel wants to reduce those subsidies. Once she returns from her hiking vacation in Italy, Mrs. Merkel will have to find a compromise. That might mean closing some nuclear power plants but prolonging the life of the most modern ones. Meanwhile, the Social Democrats and Greens are seeking to gain capital from the energy debate, hoping to further weaken the governing parties before regional elections next spring. “It is a big mess,” said Ms. Kemfert of DIW. “There is no real energy policy. Merkel should have stepped in months ago with one.”",2010-08-10T19:13:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

The three officials include Nobuaki Terasaka, the leader of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, the nation’s main nuclear regulatory body. The agency has been criticized for allowing inadequate safety measures at the Fukushima plant, including insufficient defenses against the tsunami that was unleashed by a deadly earthquake on March 11. The agency, which is part of the Ministry of Trade and Industry, has also been accused of trying to manipulate public opinion by planting people at recent town hall-style meetings to speak in support of nuclear power. The other two officials are Kazuo Matsunaga, the top bureaucrat at the ministry, and Tetsuhiro Hosono, leader of the ministry’s energy resources bureau, which promotes the power industry. The announcement comes nearly five months after the magnitude-9.0 earthquake and the tsunami it unleashed left more than 20,000 dead or missing in northern Japan. The twin disasters also damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and led to radiation leaks, the worst since the 1986 nuclear disaster in Chernobyl in Ukraine. The firing of the three officials is a highly unusual move in Japan, where elite career bureaucrats taken from the top universities have long been the nation’s de facto rulers. However, Mr. Kan has begun to focus on the collusion between the government and the power industry in what many here see as a belated effort to prolong his stay in office. The embattled prime minister had promised to step down in the face of intense criticism from within his own Democratic Party of the government’s slow and seemingly haphazard response to the nuclear disaster. But he has since appeared to backtrack, refusing to say when he will leave office. He appears to be trying to revive his fortunes by deflecting the criticism onto the bureaucracy. He has also tried to tap the public’s deep misgivings about nuclear power by calling for reducing reliance on it in favor of solar and other new energy sources. Mr. Kan appears to be betting on his reputation as a crusader against inept and corrupt bureaucracy, which he earned as health minister in the 1990s by disclosing how his ministry and industry had tried to cover up the use of HIV-tainted blood. On Sunday, he made his harshest remarks yet about government ties to the nuclear industry, saying it was “exactly the same structure of collusion that I found as health minister during the AIDS blood products problem.” But Mr. Kan’s continuing lack of popularity, as well as the critical tone of coverage in the local press, suggests that his efforts may be too little, too late. On Thursday, Asahi Shimbun , one of Japan’s largest dailies, warned that the removal of the three officials could backfire by causing more confusion and paralysis in the nation’s energy policy. Still, Mr. Kan appears intent on moving forward with what is increasingly appearing to be a sweeping overhaul of Japanese nuclear oversight. Besides the officials’ removal, the Kan government has also said it is considering a plan to separate the nuclear regulatory agency from the trade ministry, which is also in charge of promoting the power industry, and to relocate it in the environmental ministry. The plan also calls for raising the regulatory body’s status to that of a full-fledged government agency, giving it greater power. There are also signs of further changes to come at the trade ministry, one of the most powerful in Japan. In announcing the removal of the three officials on Thursday, the trade minister, Banri Kaieda, called for “rebuilding” the ministry. “I’m planning to breathe fresh air into the ministry with a large-scale reshuffle” of personnel, Mr. Kaieda told reporters. Mr. Kaieda had also promised to step down at an unspecified future time, after clashing with Mr. Kan over the handling of the nuclear crisis. However, Mr. Kaieda has emerged as a point man in Mr. Kan’s recent moves to reform the bureaucracy, in what commentators here have said may be an effort by Mr. Kaieda to position himself as a possible successor to Mr. Kan as prime minister.",2011-08-04T12:11:30.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific
b60bb1a0-3d4f-4877-b681-9450b8158f6a,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/business/energy-environment/dominion-to-close-wisconsin-nuclear-plant.html,Wisconsin Nuclear Reactor To Be Closed,"WASHINGTON — The owner of a small nuclear reactor in Wisconsin said Monday that it would close the Kewaunee Power Station early next year because it was unable to find a buyer and the plant was no longer economically viable. The decision was viewed as an early sign that the wave of retirements of old generating stations across the Midwest is now stretching from the coal industry into nuclear power, driven by slack demand for energy and the low price of natural gas. After receiving a 20-year extension from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in February 2011 to continue operating Kewaunee, Dominion, based in Richmond, Va., put the power station up for sale. At 556 megawatts, it is about half the size of the largest plants now operating and is the only reactor at the Carlton site, rendering costs higher per unit of power than sites with two reactors. Dominion had hoped to buy several reactors in the Midwest that could share some overhead expenses with Kewaunee, but did not succeed. “This was an extremely difficult decision, especially in light of how well the station is running and the dedication of the employees,” said Thomas F. Farrell II, Dominion’s chairman, president and chief executive, in a statement. “This decision was based purely on economics.” He said nuclear power would be essential to the nation’s energy future — just in other places. The company owns six other reactors at three sites, and will take a one-time charge of $281 million for the closure, which it expects in the spring. The industry’s trade association, the Nuclear Energy Institute, tried to play down the significance of the Kewaunee closing, saying it was because of circumstances unique to Dominion. Marvin Fertel, the president and chief executive of the association, said that nuclear energy “remains a reliable, cost-effective producer of electricity for America’s homes and our economy.” This did not explain, however, why no better-situated company came forward to buy the plant. When Dominion bought the plant from local owners in 2005, it signed contracts to sell them the electricity, a common practice, but as those contracts expire, the plant faces selling electricity at the lower rates that now dominate the energy market. Bruce Biewald, the founder and chief executive of Synapse Energy Economics, a consulting firm, said that low electricity prices were a severe problem for generators in places like the Midwest, where power is sold at auction. “You’re looking at margins that are declining in a really serious way,” he said. Counting Kewaunee, there are 104 power reactors licensed in the United States. Kewaunee, which received its 40-year operating license in December 1973, will be the first reactor to retire since Millstone 1, near New London, Conn., in July 1998. Annual capital costs on a 1,000 megawatt nuclear reactor range from $60 million to $70 million, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute; average annual costs for operation and maintenance plus fuel are $140 million to $150 million. And when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is finished ordering improvements prompted by the Fukushima disaster of last year, some plants will face significant expenses. Perhaps more could decide that continuing to operate was not worth the investment given current revenues. In some regions, the average selling price of a megawatt-hour today is less than $50 at times. But a survey of the industry by the Electric Utility Cost Group, an industry consortium, found that one quarter of nuclear plants with the highest costs were spending an average of $51.42 to produce a megawatt-hour from 2008 through 2010. And costs have gone up since then. Other companies have also reported falling revenues, although they may not be on the verge of closing reactors because they are in regions where the market price of electricity is higher. Nearly all the operating reactors are approaching or have reached the end of their initial license periods, and have applied for extensions or received them. But the license may not indicate the lifetime of the reactor. “No nuclear plant I know of has ever closed because it hit the end of its license,” said Peter Bradford, who served on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from 1977 to 1982 and was later chairman of the New York State Public Service Commission. A nuclear plant needs a life expectancy of a few years for its owners to consider major new investments, he said in a telephone interview, but if low electricity prices persist, even that may not be enough.",2012-10-23T01:32:58.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

Credit Credit... Leonhard Foeger/Reuters ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine — The gravest risk to the embattled Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is physical damage to equipment from shelling that could lead to a release of radiation, the director of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog agency said Friday after a visit to the site. Other risks abound, Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters in Vienna, a day after inspecting the nuclear station in southern Ukraine. The plant has been repeatedly hit by artillery. Loss of external power to cool reactor cores and stress on the operating staff also pose dangers, he said. “It is obvious there is a lot of fighting in general in this part of Ukraine,” Mr. Grossi said. “The military activity and operations are increasing in that part of the country, and this worries me a lot.” Mr. Grossi said two United Nations experts would remain at the plant to independently assess its safety going forward. Most of the damage from the war at the sprawling station, which is the largest nuclear plant in Europe, occurred during shelling in August, Mr. Grossi said, unless one considers the destruction from the battle in March when the Russian Army captured the site. This year the Zaporizhzhia plant, nestled in a gentle valley of farm fields in a once sleepy and provincial corner of Ukraine that is now a site of raging battles along a front line, became the first active nuclear plant to be caught in a combat zone in the history of civilian nuclear power. Not one of what the nuclear monitoring agency calls the seven pillars of nuclear safety, which include physical integrity, reliable external power and availability of spare parts, remains intact, Mr. Grossi said. The plant has six reactors and before the war provided 30 percent of Ukraine’s electricity. But on some points the agency’s initial assessment was more optimistic than the picture painted by Ukrainian officials, who had said that engineers and other employees had been subjected to harsh interrogation and even torture, raising stress levels when they returned to work in reactor control rooms and in other critical jobs. Mr. Grossi said that he had spoken with the Ukrainian employees and that they had found a way to cooperate — what he called “cohabitation” — with the Russian soldiers and nuclear experts also at the site. “The plant continues to operate, and there is a professional modus vivendi, if I can put it that way,” he said. Before the visit, Ukrainian officials had said the agency should discount anything employees at the plant said, arguing they are essentially hostages. Mr. Grossi said the Ukrainian and Russian nuclear engineers had managed to “cope” in operating the site and that he was less worried about disruptions in regulatory oversight and supplies of spare parts, while these problems also loomed as risks. He spoke after he and a team of inspectors crossed a front line in Russia’s war in Ukraine to conduct an inspection. Their mission was delayed by artillery strikes on their planned route, part of a swirl of chaotic violence in and around the station. Mr. Grossi said his assessment was bound to disappoint both sides for declining to place blame on one or another army for the shells hitting the plant. “I don’t want to pretend what we are doing will end this terrible war or give back this plant to Ukraine,” he said. The mission was limited to gauging nuclear safety, something he said the two-man team remaining at the site would do. “Now, when there is an allegation that something has happened at the plant, you can turn to us,” he said, rather than weighing the conflicting claims of Russia and Ukraine. “That’s the difference.” He said Russian soldiers had not blocked access to areas of the site he asked to visit. Asked to compare the potential fallout from a radiation release at Zaporizhzhia with the fire and meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in 1986, which spread radiation around Europe in the world’s worst civilian nuclear accident, Mr. Grossi said designs of the two power stations were not comparable. Zaporizhzhia’s reactors have containment vessels to limit radiation release. But he said disruptions in external power to cool reactor cores could lead to a meltdown. “It could be a big thing or a small thing, depending on the damage” from the fighting, he said.",2022-09-03T11:25:23.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

The Soviets, in their race to keep up with the West in nuclear technology, cut numerous corners in design, most of which will not be addressed by the Westinghouse fixes. As detailed in the technical memorandum provided to the Clinton Administration by the Austrian Government, submitted as an exhibit to my testimony before the House Banking Committee last February, these flaws include problems with the steam generator, the very small containment vessel and fire protection. Vice President Al Gore has put forward two arguments for the United States to help complete Temelin: (1) jobs and (2) if we don't do it, France or Germany will. Nuclear energy is capital-intensive, not labor-intensive. If the goal is to create long-term jobs, many other technologies would do better. And the only example of other countries stepping in is the Mohovice reactor in Slovakia, a joint French and German project. At Mohovice, authorities are requiring a full environmental impact assessment, public participation and the simultaneous phase-out of older nuclear reactors. The United States could at least require similar conditions at Temelin. Instead, the United States is setting an anti-environmental (and anti-safety) standard by not requiring any of these conditions, over Congressional objections. Temelin will produce power not needed in the Czech Republic. The Czech power utility (a net exporter of power the last two years) has already signed contracts for exporting more than 15 percent of Temelin's capacity to Italy and Switzerland (both countries with nuclear moratoriums) and is negotiating contracts for more. The World Bank has determined that as much as 30 percent of the Czech Republic's energy needs could be met with simple, inexpensive conservation and efficiency techniques. These solutions would provide more than twice Temelin's capacity at far less than the $1.2 billion it will cost for the nuclear solution. Why is the United States insisting on exporting obsolete nuclear technology, when it could advance our efficiency and conservation industries, in which United States utilities are the leaders?

The official announcement that two reactors at an earthquake-damaged nuclear plant could be suffering meltdowns underscores the Japanese nuclear industry’s troubled history, and years of grass-roots objections from a people uniquely sensitive to the ravages of nuclear destruction. The unfolding crisis at the two reactors, both at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, feeds into a resurgence of doubts about nuclear energy’s safety  even as it has gained credence as a source of clean energy in a time of mounting concerns about the environmental and public health tolls of fossil fuels. The crisis stems from failures of the cooling systems at the reactors at the 40-year-old Fukushima Daiichi plant. At a nearby nuclear plant, Daini, three more reactors lost their cooling systems, and Japanese officials were scrambling Sunday to determine whether the systems could be revived or would also need injections of cooling seawater. Critics of nuclear energy have long questioned the viability of nuclear power in earthquake-prone regions like Japan. Reactors have been designed with such concerns in mind, but preliminary assessments of the Fukushima Daiichi accidents suggested that too little attention was paid to the threat of tsunami. It appeared that the reactors withstood the powerful earthquake, but the ocean waves damaged generators and backup systems, harming the ability to cool the reactors. It was not until Sunday that the increasingly dangerous nature of the problems at Daiichi became clear. But even on Saturday, with Reactor No. 1 there having suffered a radiation leak and an explosion, James M. Acton of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said the nuclear industry would be shaken. While Japan may try to point to the safety of its newer facilities, concerns may run too deep, he said. Decades ago, after the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island accidents , Mr. Acton said, the nuclear industry tried to argue that newer reactors incorporated much better safety features. “That made very little difference to the public,” he said. Japan’s status as the only target of nuclear attack, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, adds to the public’s sensitivity. Benjamin Leyre, a utilities industry analyst with Exane BNP Paribas in Paris, also speaking on Saturday, said that politicians in Europe and elsewhere would almost certainly come under increased pressure to revisit safety measures. “What is likely to come will depend a lot on how transparent the regulators in Japan are,” Mr. Leyre said. “There will be a lot of focus on whether people feel confident that they know everything and that the truth is being put in front of them.” Over the years, Japanese plant operators, along with friendly government officials, have sometimes hidden episodes at plants from a public increasingly uneasy with nuclear power. In 2007, an earthquake in northwestern Japan caused a fire and minor radiation leaks at the world’s largest nuclear plant, in Kashiwazaki City. An ensuing investigation found that the operator  Tokyo Electric  had unknowingly built the facility directly on top of an active seismic fault. A series of fires inside the plant after the earthquake deepened the public’s fear. But Tokyo Electric said it upgraded the facility to withstand stronger tremors and reopened in 2009. Last year, another reactor with a troubled history was allowed to reopen, 14 years after a fire shut it down. The operator of that plant, the Monju Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor, located along the coast about 220 miles west of Tokyo, tried to cover up the extent of the fire by releasing altered video after the accident in 1995. In the hours after the blast at Reactor No. 1, nuclear advocates argued that Daiichi’s problems were singular in many ways and stemmed from a natural disaster on a scale never before experienced in Japan. They pointed out that the excavation of fossil fuels has its own history of catastrophic accidents, including coal mine collapses and the recent BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Some also said there might have been missteps in handling Reactor No. 1. A quick alternative source of water for cooling the destabilizing core should have been immediately available, said Nils J. Diaz, a nuclear engineer who led the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission from 2003 to 2006 and had visited the Daiichi plant. Mr. Diaz suggested that the Japanese might have acted too slowly to prevent overheating, including procedures that might have required the venting of small amounts of steam and radiation, rather than risk a wholesale meltdown. Fear among Japanese regulators over public reaction to such small releases may have delayed plant operators from acting as quickly as they might have, he said  a problem arising in part from the country’s larger nuclear regulatory culture. “They would rather wait and do things in a perfect manner instead of doing it as good as it needs to be now,” Mr. Diaz said. “And this search for perfection has often led to people sometimes hiding things or waiting too long to do things.” With virtually no natural resources, Japan has considered nuclear power as an alternative to oil and other fossil fuels since the 1960s. It has regarded its expertise in nuclear power as a way to cut down on its emission of greenhouse gases and to capture energy-hungry markets in Asia. Japan is one of the world’s top consumers of nuclear energy. The country’s 17 nuclear plants  boasting 55 reactors  have provided about 30 percent of its electricity needs. To make plants resistant to earthquakes, operators are required to build them on bedrock to minimize shaking and to raise anti-tsunami seawalls for plants along the coast. But the government gives power companies wide discretion in deciding whether a site is safe. In the case of Saturday’s blast, experts said that problem was avoidable. Mr. Diaz said that a comprehensive nuclear power plant safety program developed in the United States after the Sept. 11 attacks would have prevented a similar accident at any of the nation’s nuclear facilities.",2011-03-12T22:40:53.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

In Hong Kong in January, executives of the government-owned nuclear power companies of China and Taiwan signed a ''letter of intent'' to explore such a deal, Taiwan officials confirmed today. No contract has been signed, the officials said, and the talks have been suspended in recent weeks of heightened tensions as the March 18 Taiwan presidential elections approach. But officials of the Taiwan Power Co., known as Taipower, which has searched in vain for a resting place for its accumulating mountains of nuclear waste, said they hope talks can resume this spring. ''We hope we can eventually arrive at some sort of commercial arrangement with the mainland,'' said Huang Hui-yu, a spokeswoman for Taipower, in a telephone interview today. ''We have indicated our willingness to offer certain forms of technical assistance for their nuclear plants, and they indicated a possible willingness to help in handling our waste material.'' The secret talks, details of which were leaked over the weekend in Taiwan, are surprising because China angrily broke off political dialogue last summer over President Lee Teng-hui's assertions of Taiwan's independent status. Today, officials in Taipei and Beijing refused to comment on the talks. Such a deal would represent a major reversal in Taiwan's official policy of restraining commercial ties with the mainland. It suggests that officials are desperate to find a solution to the nuclear waste problem, and that the restrictive policy is likely to be eased in the coming year anyway because of pressure from Taiwan industries and China. The discussions have not been announced in China, and a decision to allow the import of radioactive waste to the mainland for the first time is certain to be controversial. But if the quid quo pro ended Taiwan's curbs on direct trade and investment across the Taiwan Strait, Beijing leaders may feel that it is worth the heat. The deal could also be portrayed as a generous act to help Taiwan, which Beijing considers a breakaway region of China rather than a foreign country. In Beijing today, officials of the China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation, the negotiating partner, were said to be unavailable for comment. Taiwan officials did not say where in China the nuclear waste might be buried. The proposed deal involves low-level wastes, such as power-plant equipment that has become radioactive, and not spent nuclear fuel rods that could possibly be reprocessed into bomb-grade materials. ''Disposing of it is not an extremely high technical problem,'' said Ms. Huang of Taipower. Still, Taiwan has been unable to find anywhere in its own limited territory willing to store the waste for good. Deepening its economic ties with the island has been a goal of the Beijing government, which believes that stronger ties would bind Taiwan more deeply to the motherland. The secret discussions were first revealed in Taiwan over the weekend by Lee Ao, a minor presidential candidate from the New Party, who apparently hoped to embarrass President Lee's government. Taiwan had first discussed such an exchange with Beijing as early as 1994, officials have since disclosed, but the talks stopped when political tensions rose and Mr. Lee tried to dampen the growing commerce. Under Mr. Lee, Taiwanese companies must obtain special permission to make large investments on the mainland and are forbidden to invest in ''strategic'' projects like electric power plants. Direct shipment and communication are not permitted, though indirect trade through Hong Kong and other routes has surged. Taiwan has some 170,000 barrels of radioactive waste, nearly 100,000 barrels on Orchid Island off Taiwan's southeastern coast, where protesting residents have forced a halt to shipments, and the rest piling up at the three operating nuclear power plants. Nuclear power provides one-fifth of Taiwan's electricity. In 1997, Taipower announced an agreement to pay North Korea to take the waste, but after concerns were raised by South Korea, the United States and environmental groups and the North Koreans became uncooperative, Taiwan's government decided against it. Another plan to build an undersea repository off the Wuchiu islands in the Taiwan Strait has set off local protests. China also reportedly objected to shipping facilities that could have military uses so close to its coast.",2000-03-14T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,world

Losing electricity means the potential loss of the ability to keep the water that cools radioactive material circulating. The United Nations agency said on Twitter that the plant, which has been occupied by Russian troops since the early days of the invasion, had suffered a loss of power that violated a “key safety pillar” for the site of the 1986 leak. But the agency added that it saw “no critical impact on safety” at this time because the amount of water in cooling ponds and around radioactive waste was sufficient, even without continuous power to the plant. But there are clearly deep worries in the nuclear community about the long-term fate of the decommissioned facility, which is still staffed by several thousand workers who oversee the plant and its fuel and waste storage. The shelling last week of a different, operating nuclear power facility led to calls from President Biden to the embattled president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr. Biden later denounced the military action, at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex in southern Ukraine, as “reckless,” one of a series of nuclear hazards that have been created by the invasion. But Chernobyl, which is in an “excluded zone” north of Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, was right on the invasion path for Russian forces flowing south from Belarus. There have been reports from the Ukrainian government — which has called for a cease-fire around the plant to allow inspectors and other workers to get in — that the 200 or so staff members who were on duty at the time of the invasion are still there and are working under guard. They have not been rotated out in nearly two weeks. The I.A.E.A.’s statement came in response to the Ukrainian nuclear regulator, which painted a more dire picture of what would happen if the power remained off the power grid for longer than 48 hours, the amount of time it said backup generators could operate. It was not clear whether those generators were working, or whether they were out of fuel. On Tuesday, the I.A.E.A. also said it had lost communications with its sensors at the plant. That may be the result of the same loss of electric power. While that does not pose an immediate threat, it means that there would be no effective way of detecting a rise in radiation levels or determining quickly where it was coming from. The occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex also remains a source of concern to international regulators, Rafael Grossi, the director of the I.A.E.A., said in Vienna on Tuesday. “If there is a nuclear accident, the cause will not be a tsunami brought on by mother nature,” Mr. Grossi said. “Instead, it will be the result of human failure to act when we knew we could, and we knew we should.” Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Galushchenko, said in a video message this week that roughly 500 Russian soldiers were in control of the complex, and that Russia’s military had moved 50 pieces of heavy artillery to defend the site. He said that employees of the plant were “physically and psychologically exhausted,” and that Russian forces were holding them hostage, a claim that was impossible to immediately verify. Attempts to reach staff in the plant by phone and email have been unsuccessful. Marc Santora contributed reporting.",2022-03-09T18:49:42.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

And France’s nuclear companies have long been seen as leaders in building and safely operating uranium-fueled reactors around the world — including in the United States — and championed by Paris as star exporters and ambassadors of French technological prowess. But in the last few years, the French dynamo has started to stall. New plants that were meant to showcase the industry’s most advanced technology are years behind schedule and billions of euros over budget. Worse, recently discovered problems at one site have raised new doubts about when, or even if, they will be completed. This is not France’s problem alone, but a challenge to the entire energy-consuming world. As worries mount about the dangers fossil fuels pose to the global climate, many countries still see atomic power as a path to clean energy, despite the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. When Paris plays host to United Nations climate talks later this year, French officials are planning to remind anyone who will listen that nuclear reactors are a low-carbon power source. But if the French can no longer demonstrate that modern nuclear power plants can be built on time and on budget, that could add to the stigma that has made many countries think twice, over concerns about safety and radioactive waste. Germany and Switzerland , for example, have dropped nuclear power as an energy option. Many nations in the developing world, though, see little choice but to adopt nuclear power as the hazards of burning coal become all too evident. If the French industry cedes its global leadership after six decades of building and operating nuclear reactors without major mishap, less seasoned providers from China and Russia would increasingly fill the vacuum. Alarmed by the French industry’s problems, the Socialist government of President François Hollande is expected soon to announce an industry overhaul. As the majority owner of the country’s two main nuclear companies — the reactor maker Areva and the big utility operator Électricité de France — the government will aim not only to put the companies on a firmer financial footing but to reorganize them in hopes of restoring the French industry’s role-model luster. On Thursday, Areva took the first of those steps by announcing big cost-cutting plans. The move is likely to trim as many as 6,000 jobs from the company’s global work force of 45,000 — as many of 4,000 of those coming in France. A helping hand for Areva could come from China, where the French industry has been a player since that country decided in 1983 to build its first nuclear plant under the industrial reforms advocated by Deng Xiaoping. On Wednesday, China National Nuclear Corporation told reporters in Beijing that it would be interested in making a financial investment in Areva. The French company responded in a statement that same day that “we are happy that CNNC is ready to strengthen its cooperation with Areva.” CNNC and another company with which Areva and Électricité de France have long worked, China General Nuclear Power Corporation, have previously signed letters of intent to participate in a big project in which the French companies are poised to play a leading role. That project, planned for Hinkley Point, England, has won British government approval as the country’s first new nuclear plant in decades. But the stumbles elsewhere by Areva and Électricité de France — better known as EDF — have raised troubling questions about the viability and cost of the Hinkley Point plant. And while Prime Minister David Cameron has courted the Chinese, other British officials have raised security questions about involving state-backed Chinese companies. With the French companies struggling, some nuclear experts see a slippery geopolitical slope. ”The problems with Areva may open the door for Russia and Chinese reactor exports, but Chinese and Russian exporters are plagued by lack of a track record in building and siting their new reactor designs, and little is known about the safety standards of these reactors,” said Antony Froggatt, a nuclear analyst at Chatham House, a London-based research organization. South Korea, despite rattling the French nuclear industry by winning a $20 billion deal to build reactors in Abu Dhabi in 2009, also suffers from limited international experience, Mr. Froggatt said. As part of the French government’s overhaul, Areva, the country’s standard-bearer in nuclear reactor design and construction, is expected to cede those parts of the business to its much bigger compatriot company EDF — whose sales last year of nearly 73 billion euros, or $82 billion, dwarfed Areva’s €8.3 billion. While EDF remains profitable, Areva has been losing a lot of money; in March it reported an annual loss of €4.8 billion — on top of a €500 million loss a year earlier. Its last profitable year was 2010. The government’s overhaul could leave a scaled-down Areva to focus on the steadier, if less glamorous, tasks of mining and refining uranium, supplying fuel to plant operators and disposing of radioactive waste. The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, said on Thursday that the government would provide an initial framework of the coming overhaul “before summer.” One possibility would be for EDF, already the world’s largest operator of nuclear plants, to take over the enormous financial, technical and engineering challenges entailed in building 21st-century atomic power plants. But it is unclear whether the reorganization could salvage France’s nuclear leadership or merely stop Areva’s financial free fall. What went wrong? The Fukushima disaster has undoubtedly undermined support for atomic power. And the rise of cheaper renewable energy, like solar and wind power, has hurt the business case for investing in huge nuclear plants. A big part of the problem, though, appears to be a bet the French nuclear establishment made more than a decade ago on a new generation of reactors. The French promised that those power plants — based on a technology called E.P.R., for European pressurized reactor — would be the safest and most powerful commercial reactors ever built. But projects under construction at Olkiluoto, Finland, and Flamanville, France, in Normandy, have fallen years behind schedule. Assuming they are ever finally commissioned, they will have cost many more times their original budgets. The Finnish plant, for example, was initially estimated to cost about €3 billion and scheduled to open in 2009. It now is not expected to open until 2018 at the earliest, at perhaps three times the originally projected cost. Areva has already recognized €4.5 billion in losses from overruns on the project. More bad news came recently. On April 7, the French nuclear regulator, the Autorité de Sûreté Nucléaire, announced that imperfections had been discovered in the steel that Areva used to make the top and bottom caps of the main reactor vessel at the plant under construction in Flamanville. Pierre-Franck Chevet, president of the nuclear regulator, has described the defects as “serious — even very serious.” The reactor vessel is a crucial part of an atomic plant — the housing meant to contain the extreme heat, pressure and radiation produced by the nuclear fission that occurs inside. The steel used for key parts of the Flamanville vessel was made at the Areva forge in Le Creusot, France. An analysis by the company found an unacceptably high level of carbon –— impurities that could threaten the steel’s structural integrity. The same forge and process were used to make the same reactor parts supplied by Areva for a plant under construction in Taishan, China, by a partnership of China General Nuclear Power Group and EDF. (The steel parts used in Finland were forged in Japan, and a spokeswoman for the Finnish operator, TVO, said they met the relevant specifications.) EDF, which declined to comment for this article, contested the regulator’s assertion in a statement on April 20. “The manufacturing processes used on Flamanville 3 reactor vessel are compliant with the mechanical requirements implemented and validated for the French nuclear reactor program,” EDF said in a statement . The companies have said they are planning new tests to show that the equipment at the Flamanville plant conforms to standards. The energy minister, Ségolène Royal, has said that the tests should be finished by October, although there is no clarity on when the regulator’s analysis will be completed. In the worst case, experts say, the vessels in Flamanville and Taishan might have to be dismantled and reforged, at a cost potentially totaling hundreds of millions of euros and creating additional major construction delays. Some experts say it might make more economic sense to simply to abandon the projects. The French nuclear industry is not alone in its struggles. The remaining longtime nuclear industry leaders, including the Japanese giant Toshiba — which now owns the American maker Westinghouse — are also encountering high costs and other problems with their latest-generation reactor designs. For instance, Southern Company, an American utility building a plant with a new type of Westinghouse reactor near Augusta, Ga., said earlier this year that the installation might be delayed for 18 months, adding $720 million to costs. The problems have left an opening for other providers. China currently has the largest domestic nuclear power construction program and 22 reactors in operation. But the Chinese industry is only beginning to break into the export market, with a plant under construction in Pakistan and a deal under discussion in Argentina. Russiahas a long list of potential international projects including plants in India, Turkey and Finland. Analysts say, though, that the Western economic sanctions imposed on Moscow over Ukraine have cast doubts on Russian nuclear exports, in part because they would need to be supported with loans that the Kremlin may no longer be able to afford. But the French industry now has a serious credibility problem, in the view of Yves Marignac, an independent energy analyst and a frequent critic of France’s nuclear policy. The unanswered questions, he said, include why Areva and EDF installed the possibly defective pieces in the reactor pit and began the welding and wiring even before testing was completed. “The fact that it was detected so late means that either EDF or Areva overlooked the risk of this kind of problem, which would reflect badly on their competence, or they were trying to create a fait accompli before it was detected,” Mr. Marignac said. “There’s a safety issue,’’ he said, “and maybe an even stronger trust issue.”",2015-05-07T22:13:17.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

With little comment and none of the bitter public protest that has dogged the 20-year Shoreham saga, trustees of New York State's Long Island Power Authority said that within two weeks they would seek proposals from several large companies to retrofit the plant. ""We are convinced that conversion is a genuine option,"" said Richard Kessel, chairman of the state authority, which purchased the Shoreham station for $1 from the Long Island Lighting Company in 1989. ""The question now is whether qualified bidders will actually step forward."" The General Electric Company, the Brooklyn Union Gas Company and CMS Energy Inc., a company that has converted a large nuclear station in Midland, Mich., to a gas-fired plant, are known to have expressed interest in the Shoreham project. But Mr. Kessel said he did not know which, if any, would submit proposals that meet the state's unusual requirements. All the Costs Under the plan, any private company that takes on Shoreham would submit a fixed-price bid, pay all construction costs and bear the burden of any cost overruns. It would also retain partial ownership and operational responsibility for the new plant. Consultants for the state have estimated the cost of the conversion at $217 million, less than the $269 million that the Long Island Lighting Company estimated that it would pay to build a nuclear power station at Shoreham in 1970 and a fraction of the $5.5 billion that was eventually spent before the plant became a symbol of the stalemate over nuclear power in the United States. One advantage of conversion, the state officials said, was that the turbines, power lines, control room and some other components of the abandoned nuclear plant could be adapted to a gas-fired plant. In a separate proposal under study in Albany, the site of the Shoreham plant, on Long Island's North Shore, would be used as a terminal for ferry service to New Haven. Within minutes of approving the proposal to seek bids on converting the plant, trustees of the state agency awarded $50.6 million in contracts to six companies that will supervise its decommissioning as a nuclear plant. Among the many problems facing the nuclear plant is that it was contaminated by radioactive material during low-level operating tests in 1985. Decommissioning the plant, which will require removal of its nuclear core and contaminated equipment, must be approved by the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Agency, which is expected to act on the matter early next year. Ultimately, Mr. Kessel said, cleaning up the Shoreham plant will cost $166 million in New York State funds.",1991-12-19T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

A panel of the National Research Council said yesterday that proposed energy sources to power weapons for the Pentagon's space-based system to defend against missiles were ''unacceptably large,'' making them impracticable to launch into orbit. Possible power sources include orbiting nuclear reactors, which the panel said ''may prove to be the only viable option'' for generating the huge amounts of power some space weapons need to destroy targets. The panel's report dealt only with power needs for directed-energy weapons such as lasers, the feasibility of which continues to be debated. At first, the Pentagon is concentrating on simple homing rockets, to be followed by more exotic weapons like lasers. A Technical Hurdle Indeed, the panel said that development of appropriate power systems had become a key technical hurdle in building directed-energy weapons. Previously, the main obstacles had been thought to be the weapons themselves, the launchers to loft weapons and sensors into space and the computer software to coordinate split-second action among thousands of sensors and weapons. The panel also criticized as inadequate the Pentagon's study of whether such power systems could be made reliable and maintainable and could survive enemy attack. In a series of recommendations, the panel urged the Pentagon to broaden its work and speed research on exotic systems that might achieve the anti-missile program's ambitious power goals. 'No Historical Precedent' In reaction, the Pentagon said the report was unduly pessimistic. ''We're developing a technology for which there is no historical precedent,'' said Richard L. Verga, head of power development for the Pentagon's Strategic Defense Initiative Organization. ''We can do better than that report indicates. We're pretty bullish.'' In the early days of ''Star Wars,'' officials stressed that the system would be non-nuclear. But it eventually became clear that nuclear reactors would play a key role. The American Physical Society, the nation's largest professional society for physicists, studied the Pentagon's secret plans and in 1987 disclosed that space-based weapons could require 100 nuclear reactors just to keep them on alert, much less to generate the bursts of power needed for successful firing. To date, the Soviet Union has launched two classes of nuclear reactors into space, the more powerful one generating 10,000 watts of electricity. While the United States has no working reactors in orbit, the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, in conjunction with the Energy Department and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is developing one that by the mid-1990's is to deliver between 10,000 and 100,000 watts of electricity, still far short of the power needed for the proposed space weapons. The Pentagon has plans for much more powerful space reactors. Asked for Evaluation The panel of the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, based in Washington, was asked by the Defense Department to evaluate its program for developing advanced power for space use. The 12-person panel was headed by Joseph G. Gavin Jr., an official with the Grumman Corporation of Bethpage, L.I. Its 140-page report, parts of which were classified secret, found that the power needed for firing space weapons would be anywhere from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of watts ''and beyond.'' It noted that this was similar to the power range for commercial power plants on earth. Various types of advanced nuclear reactors for powering space weapons could have a mass ranging between 164 and 3,205 tons, the report found. Each of these reactors was assumed to generate 500 million watts of electricity. Space Shuttle Lifts 27 Tons The space shuttle, currently the nation's most powerful launching vehicle, can lift only about 27 tons into orbit. The reactor masses, the report found, ''appear unacceptably large to operate major space-based weapons.'' ''At these projected masses,'' the report said, ''the feasibility of space power systems needed for high-power S.D.I. concepts appears impractical from both cost and launch considerations.'' The report went on to say that ''power systems appear to be a pacing item for the successful development of S.D.I. directed-energy weapon systems,'' given the power field's rate of progress. ''Accordingly,'' the report said, ''either major innovations in power systems and power system components will be required or S.D.I. power requirements will have to be relaxed.'' One of the ideas that should be explored, the panel said, is sending the power from large ground-based nuclear reactors into orbit on beams of microwaves or laser light.",1989-01-19T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

Because the life span of a nuclear power plant is 30 to 40 years, the 82 reactors operating and on line in the United States in 1984 will undergo some mode of decommissioning by 2014. Economists project that the price tag for this last hurrah of the life of nuclear reactors could reach $1 trillion. Because trillions are usually only mentioned in referring to the Federal deficit, this becomes a real shocker. Why is this information not widely known by the American public? First, the financial burden will most likely be left to our grandchildren, and to remain silent is equivalent to deluding ourselves that the problem does not exist or will go away. Second, and most important to the problem, if the American people are informed of the true and accurate costs of decommissioning, they will also realize that the cost of nuclear kilowatt production is enormously expensive.

Auctioning the plants would be required if companies want to recoup any stranded costs, or debts from investments in power plants that cannot be recovered under competition, according to the proposed legislation, which was released last night. State Representative Mary U. Eberle, co-chairwoman of the energy and technology committee, which is drafting the bill, said legislators feel that the nuclear plants' value should not be underestimated. ''We're convinced and we think the companies are convinced that they will sell power, they will sell it well, they will operate at high capacity as they have in the past and that they will be valuable assets,'' Ms. Eberle said today. Although energy deregulation has been embraced around the nation as a way to lower electric bills, a major stumbling block has been how to deal with the billions of dollars of stranded costs carried by utilities. Many companies want to be allowed to recoup these costs from rate payers, while consumer groups say the burden should instead fall on the companies and their shareholders. A handful of states, including California and Pennsylvania, have already adopted a variety of rules that give utilities several years to recoup stranded costs from customers. Some states have softened the sting to consumers with related measures that freeze or reduce rates. The Connecticut legislation proposes bringing competition to up to 35 percent of power customers in Connecticut beginning July 1, 1999 and to all consumers on July 1, 2000. The legislation allows customers who choose not to change power companies at least a 10 percent reduction in their power bill. Under the auctions, utilities would be able to sell their nuclear plants or at least determine their value if there are no buyers. A state regulatory agency would determine a minimum bid for the plants based on income potential; the difference between the depreciated value of the plant and the sales price would determine the stranded costs, according to the bill. If no bids are offered, and analysts said that is a real possibility, the minimum bid would be used to determine the stranded cost. Those costs would then be passed on to all Connecticut power customers in their bills no matter which utility they ultimately used. Michael Worms, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, said that he is doubtful anyone would want to buy nuclear power plants. While a few companies have looked at buying nuclear plants, none have sold, he said. ''There doesn't seem to be a lot of people lining up to buy them,'' Mr. Worms said. Consumer groups today said that the bill looked like an improvement over last year's, but said that it was too soon to determine how fair it would be to consumers. A nuclear plant cannot be auctioned or have its stranded costs recovered if the plant is not up and running, Ms. Eberle said, which would be an issue for Northeast Utilities because its plants have been closed for two years. Northeast Utilities, the state's largest power company, which said it had $3 billion to $4 billion in stranded costs, had little reaction to the proposal. ''It certainly is a creative approach,'' Gail A. Jamin, a company spokeswoman, said today. ''We really need to take a look at it and see what it means.''",1998-02-05T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Credit... Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Power has again been restored at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility in southern Ukraine, reducing worries about an accident at one of the war’s most sensitive sites, but the head of the United Nations’ atomic watchdog said late on Friday that the situation was still dangerous. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in a statement that, in a “much needed development,” Ukrainian engineers who have been working at the plant under intense Russian pressure had managed to restore backup power at the plant, ending its reliance on diesel generators. Most nuclear power plants consider diesel generators a last line of defense to be used only in extreme circumstances. It is the second time in recent days that shelling has cut power lines that feed the cooling systems for the plant’s six reactors, all of which are shut down. The war marks the first time that a nuclear facility has become an active battle zone. Russia has stationed troops and artillery at the plant since seizing it in March. Ukrainian authorities say the Russians have shelled nearby cities from the plant’s grounds, aware of the risk of returning fire. A waste storage site has been hit several times, and power lines have been a frequent target. Each side has blamed the other for the attacks. “Working in very challenging conditions, operating staff at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant are doing everything they can to bolster its fragile off-site power situation,” Mr. Grossi said. “Restoring the backup power connection is a positive step in this regard, even though the overall nuclear safety and security situation remains precarious.” The Zaporizhzhia plant is not providing electricity to Ukraine’s grid, given that its reactors are shut down, but it needs its own power source for safety reasons. Workers have been wrestling for weeks with how to provide that. Mr. Grossi said that work to restart one of the reactors would begin on Saturday in a process that would take several days. In addition, more diesel fuel has arrived, from both the Ukrainian and Russian side of the front line, to power Zaporizhzhia’s generators for at least 10 days should the plant again be cut off, he said. Mr. Grossi met President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Moscow and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine this week to push for the creation of a safety and security zone around the plant. The plan faces obstacles, not least because it would mean Russia would have to cede military control of a critical piece of Ukraine’s infrastructure. In addition, Mr. Putin declared this month that four Ukrainian provinces, including Zaporizhzhia, had been annexed to Russia. The announcement was rejected as illegal by the government in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and by the U.N. General Assembly but it means that, from Moscow’s point of view, the plant is now Russian. In recent weeks, Russia has said it was nationalizing the plant, placing it under the control of its own state nuclear company. It has put pressure on Ukrainian engineers and workers to report to Moscow, in defiance of orders from the government in Kyiv. Mr. Grossi said that the employees were facing “unacceptable pressure” to sign contracts with the Russian nuclear energy company, Rosatom. “I made clear that the staff must be allowed to carry out their vital tasks without undue interference or pressure,” Mr. Grossi said. His agency has said that it views the nuclear facility as Ukrainian. Ukrainian officials have noted the fatigue and stress of the plant’s control room employees, saying that Russian soldiers had subjected them to harsh interrogations, including torture, suspecting them of sabotage or of informing the Ukrainian military about activities at the plant. Ukraine’s state energy company, Energoatom, said on the Telegram messaging app on Saturday, that it had set up a hotline for workers at the plant that could be used by “everyone who has information about cases of kidnapping and torture” by Russian authorities.",2022-10-15T12:47:20.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Mr. Bogart was among the earliest and most knowledgeable independent critics of the nuclear power industry, beginning in the mid-1960's when he abandoned a career in public relations in New York to organize community groups and speak out about the hazards of using the atom to generate electricity. In 1966, Mr. Bogart founded the Citzens Energy Council, a coalition of community environmental groups that also published ""Radiation Perils"" and ""Watch on the A.E.C.,"" newsletters on the Atomic Energy Commission and the nuclear industry. Both publications warned that nuclear power plants were too complex, too expensive and so inherently unsafe they would one day prove to be a financial disaster and a health hazard.

The commission said it agreed with Lilco that because the plant has been ''defueled,'' it no longer posed the threat of an accidental release of radioactive material to the environment ''in quantities which would require protective actions for the public.'' The commission based its decision on the fact that Shoreham has only about two full-power days' worth of fuel in its spent fuel pool. A Lilco spokesman, Joseph McDonnell, said dismantling the off-site emergency plan would save the utility $8 million a year. It will not have to hold a costly evacuation drill this year and will be able to disband its ''local emergency response organization,'' he said. The emergency group consisted of about 2,900 Lilco employees who played the roles of state and local officials in the drill. Normally, any power plant licensed by the Federal commission must have an approved off-site emergency plan and must conduct an evacuation drill every two years. Lilco is in the process of trying to transfer its operating license to the state, which plans to decommission and dismantle the plant.",1990-08-03T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

How about multiple meltdowns of plutonium-fueled reactors spewing death far and wide? Not even that, apparently. Our politicians are telling us not to make any rash decisions about the viability of a nuclear future. After all, renewable sources, though safe, have only a comparatively puny output of power. Could we ourselves actually be the problem? Houses that used to get along just fine on 60 amps of power have become obese and now need 400 amps to feed our “essential” luxuries. And we appear to be completely impotent to rein in a world population growth that is now about seven billion souls, each of whom will “need” more power. None of the small stuff will matter if we do not address these larger questions. Carl Mezoff Stamford, Conn., March 15, 2011 The writer is an architect.  To the Editor: I welcome your comment that while you think nuclear power remains a valuable tool, “the public needs to know that it is a safe one.” Reading and watching the horrifying news coming out of Japan, I have wondered whether my fellow Americans might better understand why we Nevadans have been so leery of and often angry at the proposal to locate the nation’s first high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain in our state. Your newspaper has supported consideration of Yucca as a waste site and belittled our questions about its safety. Perhaps now you will rethink that. Just as many Japanese have memories of the destruction at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, some Nevadans recall being told that the mushroom clouds floating above the desert after aboveground atomic tests in the 1950s and 1960s were no threat at all; death and disease resulted from believing those claims. Michael Green Las Vegas, March 15, 2011 The writer is a professor of history at the College of Southern Nevada.  To the Editor: In a poignantly tragic twist of history, an accidental toxic catastrophe involving the peaceful use of nuclear energy is visited upon the only nation to have ever borne the brunt of intentionally inflicted nuclear explosions used as weapons of war. Lest the Japanese reactor crisis serve to undermine the acceptance of expanding the use of nuclear power in our nation, consider the staggering costs in health, quality of life and loss of life experienced in the pursuit of fossil fuels. These include coal miners who suffer or succumb to the effects of their exposure or who are trapped in their mines; wildlife and workers along America’s Gulf Coast; and soldiers and civilians whose lives are cut short or forever damaged by conflict in the Middle East. Without some proper perspective in our national discourse on energy policy, the strident rhetoric of those who would have us eternally reliant upon fossil fuels might drown out the more judicious voices. Lester R. Schwartz Weatogue, Conn., March 15, 2011  To the Editor: The recent argument for nuclear power has been that it is the only large-scale energy source that is economically competitive with fossil fuels and that won’t contribute to global warming. But as the horrible disaster in Japan is making clear, nuclear energy comes with many hidden costs. These are already manifest in the government insurance that is necessary to raise capital to build reactors and in the government responsibility for nuclear waste disposal. Add to this the government responsibility for the costs of disaster management and recovery and for decommissioning ruined reactors, not to mention whatever dollar amount you want to assign to the lives lost or ruined in disasters, and the real costs soar. Fossil fuels also have the hidden costs of climate change, which will likely dwarf those of nuclear power, as well as the costs of oil spills and other disasters and myriad government subsidies. If all of these hidden costs were factored in, we might find that renewables are by far the cheapest source of energy. Kenneth Miller New York, March 15, 2011",2011-03-16T02:59:40.000+01:00,NYTIMES,letters-opinion

These plants would generate less power — about one-seventh the output of the giant nuclear installation being built at Hinkley Point in southwest England. But Rolls-Royce said it hoped to reduce construction costs to around 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) each, compared with an estimated £22.5 billion for the Hinkley Point plant.

The disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi plant , stricken by an earthquake and a tsunami last March, has led to widespread criticism of nuclear officials for their lax approach to safety, as well as for a bungled response that allowed meltdowns to occur at three of the plant’s six reactors. The scale of the accident, which forced almost 100,000 people from their homes and contaminated a wide area of northeastern Japan, has put pressure on the government to explain why warnings about the plant’s safety went unheeded and global safety standards were ignored, even as officials promoted nuclear power as the country’s most reliable source of electricity. Haruki Madarame, head of a panel of nuclear safety experts who provide technical advice to the government, told a Parliament-sponsored inquiry on Wednesday that Japanese officials had succumbed to a blind belief in the country’s technical prowess and failed to thoroughly assess the risks of building nuclear reactors in an earthquake-prone country. For example, officials did not give serious consideration to what would happen if electric power were lost at a nuclear station, because they believed that Japan’s power grid was far more reliable than those in other countries, he said. The March earthquake and tsunami cut off the Fukushima plant from the grid, leaving operators unable to keep the reactor cores from overheating. “Though global safety standards kept on improving, we wasted our time coming up with excuses for why Japan didn’t need to bother meeting them,” Mr. Madarame said. Officials also gave too little attention, he said, to new studies raising the possibility of large earthquakes off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture. Mr. Madarame said he was to blame for some of the lapses, but that the Nuclear Safety Commission had a culture of complacency long before he took over in mid-2010. His candid testimony comes at a time when the government is pushing to restart reactors around the country that were shut down following the accident. Only 3 of Japan’s 54 reactors are operating; the rest have been kept idle by local governments worried about safety. To quell opposition, the central government has ordered new “stress tests” to assess whether the plants can withstand a major natural disaster. But the investigative commission’s hearings could undermine efforts to restart more reactors. Mr. Madarame said the government should go far beyond the lax safety checks that Japanese regulators performed for years, which he said were still being carried out in some cases using “technology three decades old.” He said that regulators had been too cozy with the industry. Mr. Madarame also criticized Tokyo Electric Power, the operator of the Fukushima plant, for saying that it could not possibly have prepared for a tsunami as strong as the one last March, which killed 20,000 people along Japan’s northeast coast.",2012-02-16T00:35:32.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The request came as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, seeking to show that the fight over Shoreham had entered a new chapter, toured the idle plant for the first time. New York State formally asked the Federal Government today for permission to take over the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station so it can be dismantled. The request came as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, seeking to show that the fight over Shoreham had entered a new chapter, toured the idle plant for the first time. Standing inside the reactor building next to a pool of water containing spent nuclear fuel, the Governor defended the decision to take control of and dismantle Shoreham as the best way to insure Long Island's safety and keep the cost of electricity down. ''The decision that this was not the right place for a nuclear facility was a good thing,'' he said. Transfer of License Sought After touring the plant he has long opposed on the ground that the surrounding area could not be evacuated safely in an emergency, the Governor attended a meeting of the Long Island Power Authority, the state agency formed to take over the plant from its current owner, the Long Island Lighting Company. At the meeting, the power authority's trustees adopted a resolution allowing them to ask the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission for Shoreham's license. The application has been a long time coming. In the spring of 1989, New York State and Lilco signed an agreement under which the company would sell the plant to the state for $1 in exchange for 10 years of rate increases. The utility's shareholders accepted the agreement a year ago today, and the power authority has spent the last year preparing to file the license application and quelling criticism that it is not qualified to own a power plant, even a deactivated one. The story of Shoreham, the $5.5 billion plant that was fully built but never allowed to operate except in low-power tests, is far from over. It is now up to the Federal nuclear agency, which regulates the nation's power plants, to review the power authority's application and determine if it is qualified to hold the Shoreham license. That decision may not come for several months. Plant Finished in 1984 The plant, completed in 1984, was built to ease an energy shortage on Long Island. Lilco officials said it would generate 800 megawatts of electricity, enough for one-third of the 903,000 homes on the Island. But the plant encountered immediate opposition from Suffolk County residents and from Governor Cuomo. They said an area as long and narrow as Long Island could not be evacuated safely in the event of a nuclear accident. The plant received a full power license last year, but the fuel has been removed from the reactor, and many of the systems have been shut down in anticipation of the plant's dismantling. If the power authority does receive Shoreham's license, it is unclear what will become of the plant. The state is studying the possibility of converting it to a power plant that runs on natural gas.",1990-06-29T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Angry fishermen vowed to defend areas where they had fished and harvested seaweed for generations. Two decades later, when Chugoku Electric was considering whether to expand the plant with a third reactor, Kashima once again swung into action: this time, to rally in favor. Prodded by the local fishing cooperative, the town assembly voted 15 to 2 to make a public appeal for construction of the $4 billion reactor. Kashima’s reversal is a common story in Japan, and one that helps explain what is, so far, this nation’s unwavering pursuit of nuclear power: a lack of widespread grass-roots opposition in the communities around its 54 nuclear reactors. This has held true even after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami generated a nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi station that has raised serious questions about whether this quake-prone nation has adequately ensured the safety of its plants. So far, it has spurred only muted public questioning in towns like this. Prime Minister Naoto Kan has, at least temporarily, shelved plans to expand Japan’s use of nuclear power — plans promoted by the country’s powerful nuclear establishment. Communities appear willing to fight fiercely for nuclear power, despite concerns about safety that many residents refrain from voicing publicly. To understand Kashima’s about-face, one need look no further than the Fukada Sports Park, which serves the 7,500 mostly older residents here with a baseball diamond, lighted tennis courts, a soccer field and a $35 million gymnasium with indoor pool and Olympic-size volleyball arena. The gym is just one of several big public works projects paid for with the hundreds of millions of dollars this community is receiving for accepting the No. 3 reactor, which is still under construction. As Kashima’s story suggests, Tokyo has been able to essentially buy the support, or at least the silent acquiescence, of communities by showering them with generous subsidies, payouts and jobs. In 2009 alone, Tokyo gave $1.15 billion for public works projects to communities that have electric plants, according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Experts say the majority of that money goes to communities near nuclear plants. And that is just the tip of the iceberg, experts say, as the communities also receive a host of subsidies, property and income tax revenues, compensation to individuals and even “anonymous” donations to local treasuries that are widely believed to come from plant operators. Unquestionably, the aid has enriched rural communities that were rapidly losing jobs and people to the cities. With no substantial reserves of oil or coal, Japan relies on nuclear power for the energy needed to drive its economic machine. But critics contend that the largess has also made communities dependent on central government spending — and thus unwilling to rock the boat by pushing for robust safety measures. In a process that critics have likened to drug addiction, the flow of easy money and higher-paying jobs quickly replaces the communities’ original economic basis, usually farming or fishing. Nor did planners offer alternatives to public works projects like nuclear plants. Keeping the spending spigots open became the only way to maintain newly elevated living standards. Experts and some residents say this dependency helps explain why, despite the legacy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the accidents at the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl nuclear plants, Japan never faced the levels of popular opposition to nuclear power seen in the United States and Europe — and is less likely than the United States to stop building new plants. Towns become enmeshed in the same circle — which includes politicians, bureaucrats, judges and nuclear industry executives — that has relentlessly promoted the expansion of nuclear power over safety concerns. “This structure of dependency makes it impossible for communities to speak out against the plants or nuclear power,” said Shuji Shimizu, a professor of public finance at Fukushima University. Code of Silence Indeed, a code of silence seems to prevail even now in towns like Kashima, which merged with the neighboring city of Matsue a half decade ago. Tsuneyoshi Adachi, a 63-year-old fisherman, joined the huge protests in the 1970s and 1980s against the plant’s No. 2 reactor. He said many fishermen were angry then because chlorine from the pumps of the plant’s No. 1 reactor, which began operating in 1974, was killing seaweed and fish in local fishing grounds. However, Mr. Adachi said, once compensation payments from the No. 2 reactor began to flow in, neighbors began to give him cold looks and then ignore him. By the time the No. 3 reactor was proposed in the early 1990s, no one, including Mr. Adachi, was willing to speak out against the plant. He said that there was the same peer pressure even after the accident at Fukushima, which scared many here because they live within a few miles of the Shimane plant. “Sure, we are all worried in our hearts about whether the same disaster could happen at the Shimane nuclear plant,” Mr. Adachi said. However, “the town knows it can no longer survive economically without the nuclear plant.” While few will say so in public, many residents also quietly express concern about how their town gave up its once-busy fishing industry. They also say that flashy projects like the sports park have brought little lasting economic benefit. The No. 3 reactor alone brought the town some $90 million in public works money, and the promise of another $690 million in property tax revenues spread over more than 15 years once the reactor becomes operational next year. In the 1990s, property taxes from the No. 2 reactor supplied as much as three-quarters of town tax revenues. The fact that the revenues were going to decline eventually was one factor that drove the town to seek the No. 3 reactor, said the mayor at the time, Zentaro Aoyama. Mr. Aoyama admitted that the Fukushima accident had frightened many people here. Even so, he said, the community had no regrets about accepting the Shimane plant, which he said had raised living standards and prevented the depopulation that has hollowed out much of rural Japan. “What would have happened here without the plant?” said Mr. Aoyama, 73, who said the town used its very first compensation payment from the No. 1 reactor back in the late 1960s to install indoor plumbing. While the plants provide power mostly to distant urban areas, they were built in isolated, impoverished rural areas. Kazuyoshi Nakamura, 84, recalls how difficult life was as a child in Kataku, a tiny fishing hamlet within Kashima that faces the rough Sea of Japan. His father used a tiny wooden skiff to catch squid and bream, which his mother carried on her back to market, walking narrow mountain paths in straw sandals. Still, at first local fishermen adamantly refused to give up rights to the seaweed and fishing grounds near the plant, said Mr. Nakamura, who was a leader of Kataku’s fishing cooperative at the time. They eventually accepted compensation payments that have totaled up to $600,000 for each fisherman. “In the end, we gave in for money,” Mr. Nakamura said. Today, the dirt-floor huts of Mr. Nakamura’s childhood have been replaced by oversize homes with driveways, and a tunnel has made central Kashima a five-minute drive away. But the new wealth has changed this hamlet of almost 300 in unforeseen ways. Only about 30 aging residents still make a living from fishing. Many of the rest now commute to the plant, where they work as security guards or cleaners. “There was no need to work anymore because the money just flowed so easily,” said a former town assemblyman who twice ran unsuccessfully for mayor on an antinuclear platform. A Flow of Cash Much of this flow of cash was the product of the Three Power Source Development Laws, a sophisticated system of government subsidies created in 1974 by Kakuei Tanaka, the powerful prime minister who shaped Japan’s nuclear power landscape and used big public works projects to build postwar Japan’s most formidable political machine. The law required all Japanese power consumers to pay, as part of their utility bills, a tax that was funneled to communities with nuclear plants. Officials at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which regulates the nuclear industry, and oversees the subsidies, refused to specify how much communities have come to rely on those subsidies. “This is money to promote the locality’s acceptance of a nuclear plant,” said Tatsumi Nakano of the ministry’s Agency for Natural Resources and Energy. A spokesman for Tohoku Electric Power Company, which operates a plant in Higashidori, said that the company is not involved in the subsidies, and that since Fukushima, it has focused on reassuring the public of the safety of nuclear plants. Political experts say the subsidies encourage not only acceptance of a plant but also, over time, its expansion. That is because subsidies are designed to peak soon after a plant or reactor becomes operational, and then decline. “In many cases, what you’ll see is that a town that was depopulating and had very little tax base gets a tremendous insurge of money,” said Daniel P. Aldrich , a political scientist at Purdue University who has studied the laws. As the subsidies continue to decline over the lifetime of a reactor, communities come under pressure to accept the construction of new ones, Mr. Aldrich said. “The local community gets used to the spending they got for the first reactor — and the second, third, fourth, and fifth reactors help them keep up,” he added. Critics point to the case of Futaba, the town that includes Fukushima Daiichi’s No. 5 and No. 6 reactors, which began operating in 1978 and 1979, respectively. According to Professor Shimizu of Fukushima University, Fukushima Daiichi and the nearby Fukushima Daini plants directly or indirectly employed some 11,000 people in communities that include Futaba — or about one person in every two households. Since 1974, communities in Fukushima Prefecture have received about $3.3 billion in subsidies for its electrical plants, most of it for the two nuclear power facilities, Mr. Shimizu said. Despite these huge subsidies, most given in the 1970s, Futaba recently began to experience budget problems. As they did in Kashima, the subsidies dwindled along with other revenues related to the nuclear plant, including property taxes. By 2007, Futaba was one of the most fiscally troubled towns in Japan and nearly went bankrupt. Town officials blamed the upkeep costs of the public facilities built in the early days of flush subsidies and poor management stemming from the belief that the subsidies would remain generous. Eisaku Sato, who served as the governor of Fukushima Prefecture from 1988 to 2006 and became a critic of the nuclear industry, said that 30 years after its first reactor started operating, the town of Futaba could no longer pay its mayor’s salary. “With a nuclear reactor, in one generation, or about 30 years, it’s possible that you’ll become a community that won’t be able to survive,” Mr. Sato said. Futaba’s solution to its fiscal crisis was to ask the government and Tokyo Electric, Fukushima Daiichi’s operator, to build two new reactors, which would have eventually increased the number of reactors at Fukushima Daiichi to eight. The request immediately earned Futaba new subsidies. “Putting aside whether ‘drugs’ is the right expression,” Mr. Sato said, “if you take them one time, you’ll definitely want to take them again.” Eiji Nakamura, the failed candidate for mayor of Kashima, said the town came to rely on the constant flow of subsidies for political as well as economic reasons. He said the prefectural and town leaders used the jobs and money from public works to secure the support of key voting blocs like the construction industry and the fishing cooperative, to which about a third of the town’s working population belongs. “They call it a nuclear power plant, but it should actually be called a political power plant,” Mr. Nakamura joked. The Most to Lose This dependence explains why Prime Minister Kan’s talk of slowing Japan’s push for nuclear power worries few places as much as the Shimokita Peninsula, an isolated region in northern Honshu. The peninsula’s first reactor went online in 2005, two are under construction, and two more are still being planned. Japan is also building massive nuclear waste disposal and reprocessing facilities there. As newcomers to nuclear power, Shimokita’s host communities now have the most to lose. Consider Higashidori, a town with one working reactor and three more scheduled to start operating over the next decade. With the subsidies and other revenues from four planned reactors, town officials began building an entirely new town center two decades ago. Serving a rapidly declining population of 7,300, the town center is now dominated by three gigantic, and barely used, buildings in the shape of a triangle, a circle and a square, which, according to the Tokyo-based designer, symbolize man, woman and child. Nearby, a sprawling campus with two running tracks, two large gymnasiums, eight tennis courts and an indoor baseball field serves fewer than 600 elementary and junior high school children. In 2010, nearly 46 percent of the town’s $94 million budget came from nuclear-related subsidies and property taxes. Shigenori Sasatake, a town official overseeing nuclear power, said Higashidori hoped that the Japanese government and plant operators would not waver from their commitment to build three more reactors there, despite the risks exposed at Fukushima. “Because there are risks, there is no way reactors would be built in Tokyo, but only here in this kind of rural area,” Mr. Sasatake said, adding that town officials harbored no regrets about having undertaken such grandiose building projects. But Higashidori’s building spree raised eyebrows in Oma, another peninsula town, with 6,300 residents, where construction on its first reactor, scheduled to start operating in 2014, was halted after the Fukushima disaster. Tsuneyoshi Asami, a former mayor who played a critical role in bringing the plant to Oma, said that the town did not want to be stuck with fancy but useless buildings that would create fiscal problems in the future. So far, Oma has resisted building a new town hall, using nuclear subsidies instead to construct educational and fisheries facilities, as well as a home for the elderly. “Regular people and town council members kept saying that no other community where a plant was located has stopped at only one reactor — that there was always a second or third one — so we should be spending more,” Mr. Asami said. “But I said no.” Still, even in Oma, there were worries that the Fukushima disaster would indefinitely delay the construction of its plant. It is just the latest example of how the system of subsidies and dependency Japan created to expand nuclear power makes it difficult for the country to reverse course. “We absolutely need it,” Yoshifumi Matsuyama, the chairman of Oma’s Chamber of Commerce, said of the plant. “Nothing other than a nuclear plant will bring money here. That’s for sure. What else can an isolated town like this do except host a nuclear plant?”",2011-05-31T02:15:57.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The new position reverses more than 15 years of staunch state support for the Seabrook reactor. The Governor of New Hampshire announced yesterday that the state would seek to block low-power testing at the Seabrook nuclear plant because of doubts about the plant's ever being allowed to operate at full power. The new position reverses more than 15 years of staunch state support for the Seabrook reactor. Gov. Judd Gregg said low-power testing would greatly increase the expenses of closing and cleaning up the plant if the reactor is eventually abandoned. He said the Public Service Company of New Hampshire, which has the largest ownership stake in Seabrook, should not conduct the testing ''unless it has first obtained the clearances necessary to begin full-power operation, including final evacuation plans.'' Licensing Delayed The $5.9 billion plant was completed in 1986 but is unlicensed because the State of Massachusetts has refused to submit emergency plans, contending that evacuation of the area would be impossible. The Seabrook plant is two miles from the Massachusetts border. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which licenses nuclear plants, does not require that emergency plans be drawn up before testing at the low-power level, which is 5 percent of full power. In the commission's view, any accident at low power would not require an emergency response outside the plant boundary. Largely because of the impasse over Seabrook, Public Service is under the protection of a Federal Bankruptcy Court. Governor Gregg said the state would ask Judge James E. Yacos, the bankruptcy judge, to block the tests. The request, he said, would be filed within two weeks. 'Considerable Economic Question' Judge Yacos noted in July that some parties to the bankruptcy had already opposed low-power testing and had raised what he called a ''considerable economic question.'' Running the reactor at low power, he said, could result in ''a diminution of the value of the assets of this estate by an unwise and premature activation of the nuclear chain reaction.'' But he did not rule on the question at the time. Opponents of the plant have urged the Nuclear Regulatory Commission not to allow low-power tests, citing the increase in costs if the plant is abandoned. The commission said in December that the plant owners, a consortium of New England utilities, could resolve that issue by setting aside the money that would be needed to pay for an abandoment. The commission set the amount at $72.1 million. The owners said in December that they would set aside the money, but they have not yet announced how they would do so. The issue of the money appears to be the last significant barrier to a low-power license. A similar dispute arose in New York in the mid-1980's regarding the Shoreham nuclear plant on Long Island. New York State argued before the commission that low-power testing of Shoreham would increase costs of abandoning the plant. The commission ruled that the owner of Shoreham, the Long Island Lighting Company, could proceed with low-power testing at its own risk. Figuring the Costs It now appears that Shoreham is to be abandoned at the expense of the state. The extra cost from low-power testing may not be known for years, however. In his statement, Governor Gregg said ''a company in bankruptcy should not voluntarily accept additional liabilities.'' Public Service owns 35.6 percent of Seabrook, and its share of the projected abandonment costs would be about $25 million. Governor Gregg took office Jan. 5, replacing John Sununu, who had been one of the plant's strongest supporters. Mr. Sununu clashed often on the issue with Michael S. Dukakis, Governor of Massachusetts, who refused to submit emergency plans.",1989-03-09T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business

The resulting fire was quickly extinguished, a thick wall prevented a breach, and in the ensuing five months the war, and global attention, moved on to new fronts, new outrages and new horrors. The war has had no shortage of devastation and global consequence — shifting geopolitical alliances, hunger in Africa exacerbated by missing grain exports, massacres of Ukrainian civilians, mass migrations and enormous losses of Ukrainian and Russian troops. Yet the repeated shelling of the sprawling Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in recent days has particularly roused widespread fears and outrage about the sheer folly and existential danger of turning Europe’s largest nuclear power plant into a theater of war. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, speaking late Thursday night to a nation that still bears the scars of nuclear catastrophe from the meltdown of the facility at Chernobyl in 1986, said the Kremlin was engaging in “unconcealed nuclear blackmail” and called the situation at the plant “one of the biggest crimes of the terrorist state.”",2022-08-13T01:00:12.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

There, amid spookily forsaken homes and cars, he talks about the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, as well as the meltdowns, and says he understands why people are afraid of nuclear power. Wearing a white Tyvek suit and knotting his forehead, he occasionally pauses to take a radiation reading with a meter no bigger than a cellphone. “So, are you still pro-nuclear?” asks a man off camera, presumably the director Robert Stone. Mr. Lynas squints at his interlocutor and asks, “Are you still pro-nuclear?” It’s a redundant question, even in Fukushima. Less than 10 minutes into “Pandora’s Promise,” Mr. Stone, whose documentaries include “Guerrilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst,” has made it clear where he stands, from the experts whom he’s gathered to make the environmental case for nuclear energy. Some of these specialists are brought in soon after the movie opens with scenes from an anti-nuclear power demonstration that features the anti-nuke activist Helen Caldicott braying into a microphone (“It’s wicked!”), her voice distorting as she turns up the volume, while other protesters, some dressed as skeletons, wield placards. By contrast, Mr. Stone’s first expert, Stewart Brand, the founder and publisher of the “Whole Earth Catalog,” is introduced looking silently over a pristine stretch of coast. This comic divide — the strident old lady environmentalist with the apparent bad dye job (Ms. Caldicott) versus a Yoda of the modern environmental movement (Mr. Brand) — makes for quite a setup. Yet such deck-stacking in movies can also be a viewer turnoff, no matter how seemingly worthy the cause. And “Pandora’s Promise” is as stacked as advocate movies get. Its other testifiers include the nuclear physicist Charles Till , who helped develop a type of reactor called the Integral Fast Reactor, and Leonard J. Koch, who helped create EBR-1 , an early nuclear reactor in Idaho. Financial backing, meanwhile, has come from various sources, among them the deep-pocketed Paul G. Allen , whose Vulcan Inc. has invested in what it terms “advanced nuclear technologies.” In brief — or so the movie’s one-sided reasoning goes — everything that anti-nuclear energy activists and skeptics have thought about the issue is wrong. Decades of politically and ideologically driven fearmongering and misinformation have led to its demonization when it could be our salvation. Drawing on original interviews, archival materials, computer animations and even, d’oh, “The Simpsons,” Mr. Stone builds his case seamlessly but leaves no room for dissent, much less a drop of doubt. “To be anti-nuclear,” another of his experts, the journalist Richard Rhodes, says, “is basically to be in favor of burning fossil fuel.” Certainly there’s an environmental case to be made for nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels, which is exactly what some activists and journalists have been exploring for years. But you need to make an argument. A parade of like-minded nuclear-power advocates who assure us that everything will be all right just doesn’t cut it.",2013-06-12T00:05:55.000+02:00,NYTIMES,culture-movies

Experts say many changes will be needed to revive the withering nuclear industry and that the number of changes necessary is growing. Pressing problems with acid rain, climate change and energy imports have created an impetus to build new reactors, these experts say, but all the reactors ordered after 1973 have been canceled and the infrastructure needed to support the industry is shrinking. The problems of the industry were addressed by about 100 government, industry and academic experts here for a conference organized by the nuclear engineering department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''The condition of the industry is continuing to worsen, and more and more things pop up as crucial items,'' said Michael W. Golay, the conference chairman and a professor of nuclear engineering at M.I.T. Regaining Trust The biggest of the required changes, several experts said, is to regain public trust. ''Nuclear power has a much higher barrier to cross'' than power from fossil fuels, said Lawrence M. Lidsky, a professor of nuclear engineering at M.I.T. He added that ''public irrationality'' was part of the reason. ''If I ask myself as a member of the public whether I'd rather be killed by a tornado or a nuclear accident, I'd pick the tornado any time,'' he said, even though he would be just as dead either way. Dr. Lidsky suggested regaining public confidence through a demonstration that could prove a reactor could weather an accident - in effect, the nuclear equivalent of an automobile crash test. In such a test, he suggested, all the cooling water of a reactor would be drained, the shutdown rods would be deliberately removed and a ''malicious operator'' allowed to run the control room. A Different Tone Others said that even if such a test worked, it probably would not be sufficient to win over opponents. The discussion of trust among the participants at the two-day conference, known as the First M.I.T. International Conference on the Next Generation of Nuclear Power Technology, differed in tone from many earlier debates about reviving the technology. Those debates have concentrated on changes in the law and in reactor hardware. ''Elements of the nuclear industry may prefer not to say out loud that there is a problem with trust,'' Professor Golay said in an interview. ''From their point of view, there is no benefit to saying the public doesn't trust them.'' Participants quoted data from various surveys on what fraction of the population found nuclear power acceptable or desirable. Many asserted that the number of opponents was well under 50 percent, but that if the minority was passionate enough, it could exercise a veto. A 'Skeptical Elite' Alvin M. Weinberg, a physicist at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee and a senior figure in the nuclear world, said the main opposition is not from the public at large, which cannot evaluate detailed technical matters, but from a ''skeptical elite'' that the public follows. Thus far, reactor manufacturers and other advocates have generally not addressed the issue of trust directly. Rather, since the mid-80's they have focused on three changes they said would allow new plants to be built: a simplified licensing system; an improved, standardized design, and a solution to the waste disposal problem. Some experts here pointed out that the competition that a new generation of nuclear reactors would face is getting tougher. Equipment for burning natural gas and coal, for example, is advancing rapidly, with new models producing far more power with less fuel, and more cleanly. And many utilities and state regulators look skeptically at building any kind of generating station, believing that $1 billion spent on more efficient light bulbs and electric motors would save more electricity than a $1 billion generating station could produce, no matter what the fuel. A Shrinking Industry The nuclear industry is shrinking, with only a handful of plants still under construction and fewer parts suppliers willing to go to the expense and trouble of producing reactor components. The reactor manufacturers' answer to the problem of public skepticism has been to develop reactors described as ''passively safe'' or ''inherently safe,'' with safety relying in large part on water flowing down hill or heat dissipating through natural convection. They have argued that current reactors are so safe that accidents that damage the nuclear cores, releasing radiation, are likely to occur only once in several hundred thousand years of operation. Their new designs, the builders say, would produce accidents even less frequently. A Unique View But Paul Slovic, a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon and a specialist on risk perception, said that the public does not believe these efforts to communicate the level of risk, and views nuclear power as uniquely dangerous. ''If you've got trust, you don't need fancy risk communications,'' Professor Slovic said. ''And if you don't have trust, no communication is going to do it for you.'' Jan Beyea, a physicist with the National Audubon Society, added that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was not helping the industry by deciding not to raise the safety standards for the next generation of reactors. ''To have standards out there identical to existing reactors, which are disfavored, is not going to get you anywhere,'' he said.",1990-10-08T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business

No company had completed a new plant in decades, and the disaster in Fukushima, Japan, in 2011 intensified public disenchantment with the technology, both here and abroad. But as the Paris agreement on climate change has put pressure on the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, some state and federal officials have deemed nuclear energy part of the solution. They are now scrambling to save existing plants that can no longer compete economically in a market flooded with cheap natural gas. “We’re supposed to be adding zero-carbon sources, not subtracting,” Ernest Moniz, the energy secretary, said recently at a symposium that the department convened to explore ways to improve the industry’s prospects. As a result, there are efforts across the country to bail out nuclear plants at risk of closing, with important test cases in Illinois, Ohio and New York, as well as proposed legislation in Congress. Exelon , one of the country’s largest nuclear operators, for example, is deciding whether to close two of its struggling plants in Illinois after efforts to push a bailout through its Legislature fell apart. Nuclear power remains mired in longstanding questions over waste disposal, its safety record after the catastrophes at places like Fukushima and Chernobyl, and the potential for its plants to be converted into weapon-making factories. In spite of the lingering issues, policy makers, analysts and executives, along with a growing number of environmentalists, say that at stake is the future of the country’s largest source of clean energy. “Nothing else comes close,” Mr. Moniz, a nuclear physicist, said at the symposium. In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Moniz added, “Maintaining the nuclear fleet is really important for meeting our near-term and midterm goals.” Renewable sources like solar and wind have grown in popularity in recent years, but nuclear plants provide nearly 60 percent of carbon-free power, followed by hydroelectric plants at roughly 18 percent, according to the Energy Information Administration . In addition, nuclear plants, which can produce power steadily and on demand, run at more than 90 percent of their capacity, higher than any other type of plant, including gas and coal facilities. They also have the advantage of keeping fuel on-site, which allowed them to supply electricity during the extreme cold of the polar vortex in 2014, when the use of natural gas for heating led to shortages and when some coal plants shut down because of frozen fuel or equipment. In recent years, a rise in greenhouse gas emissions has tended to follow nuclear plant closings, since they are most often replaced by natural gas, industry executives say. This was the case in California and New England after the San Onofre and Vermont Yankee plants folded. But the nuclear industry is facing a crisis of old age. The majority of the country’s 99 nuclear reactors are more than 30 years old and were opened before deregulation. Starting in the late 1970s, under federal rules established to help reduce the price of electricity, independent power producers gained the ability to compete in wholesale electricity markets. When prices were relatively high, nuclear plants were able to fare well because their facilities, once up and running, were inexpensive to operate. However, the recent slowdown in the demand for electricity and the glut of natural gas from the rise in fracking has driven down wholesale prices. That lower revenue poses special challenges for nuclear plants, which operate potentially for as long as 80 years, and so require costly upgrades and repairs during their life spans. “At these prices,” said Jay Apt, a professor and a director of the Electricity Industry Center at Carnegie Mellon University, “they can’t save up enough to have cash on hand for periodic capital investments.” Supporters of the bailouts say the current prices undervalue nuclear power, given the method’s lack of greenhouse gas emissions and ability to operate at all hours. The low prices make it hard for the plants to compete with other clean technologies like wind and solar, which receive subsidies and are bolstered by mandates that require purchases of clean power. They argue that the environmental and efficiency value of nuclear plants mean they should be eligible for similar subsidies or be included in clean energy mandates. “We get no recognition for the fact that we emit nothing,” said Marvin S. Fertel, chief executive of the Nuclear Energy Institute , an industry trade group. Support for plans to save nuclear energy has come from a seemingly unlikely group — environmentalists, some who have come to believe that the climate benefits of nuclear energy far outweigh the risks. Michael Shellenberger, president of Environmental Progress , a nonprofit research and policy organization, said that because nuclear plants produce so much more energy than other forms, they can be more environmentally friendly than even renewables when all the mining, development and land disturbances are taken into account. “Those of us who have changed our minds on it have changed most often on the climate stuff,” Mr. Shellenberger said, “but from the whole life-cycle analysis, it’s just better.” Opponents argue that the industry has already had decades of support, which made many of the companies that own the plants profitable, and that further subsidizing nuclear energy would take momentum and investment away from renewables like solar and wind. “We need to be building the 21st-century energy system and not continuing to subsidize the energy system of the past,” said Abraham Scarr, director of the Illinois Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocate. Without help, nuclear officials say, there will be far less nuclear power. Two Exelon plants, Quad Cities in Illinois and Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, for instance, were unable to submit winning bids in a recent auction to meet future energy needs in the PJM territory, covering 13 Middle Atlantic and Midwestern states and the District of Columbia. After the auction, Christopher M. Crane, chief executive at Exelon, said that by itself the market “can’t preserve zero-carbon emitting nuclear plants that are facing the lowest wholesale energy prices in 15 years.” Exelon pressured the Illinois State Legislature to approve a raft of energy measures, including extra subsidies for nuclear as a zero-carbon energy source, by the end of May or risk the shutdown of the two plants. However, the proposals never came up for a vote. Exelon, which has not yet announced a decision on the plants, is hardly the only company seeking more income for its facilities. In March, Ohio regulators approved plans between the utilities and power generation subsidiaries of FirstEnergy and AEP that guaranteed set rates for power from some struggling nuclear and coal plants, even if other plants in the market charged less. But federal regulators blocked the arrangement pending a review. FirstEnergy is now pursuing an amended version, which executives hope will go forward with state approval alone. It would allow the company to charge customers for the shortfall between the costs to operate the plants and the market rate it receives over the next eight years; customers would receive credit if the rate rose above the costs. In New York, officials are taking a different approach. Public hearings were held last month on a proposed clean energy mandate that would include an credit paid to nuclear operators, aimed at helping keep upstate plants like FitzPatrick in Oswego County in operation. The Exelon proposal in Illinois followed a similar logic but attracted a number of critics — including the state attorney general, Lisa Madigan — who said that customers had paid for the plants twice and should not have to pay again, especially when Exelon’s overall finances may not be so dire. “The disruption in these communities if Exelon decides to shut down the plants is very significant and has a human consequence,” said Dave Lundy, a Chicago public relations executive who leads a coalition opposed to the proposal. “But I don’t know that they actually have to shut down these plants.”",2016-06-01T05:08:40.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

The Bushehr reactor , cast by Tehran as a showcase of its peaceful nuclear intentions, is separate from other more contentious operations elsewhere in the country where Iran is seeking to enrich uranium. But the timing is delicate in diplomatic terms, as tighter sanctions are being put in place against Iran by the United Nations Security Council, the United States and the European Union. Iran has not yet formally responded to an invitation to join international powers for talks on its nuclear program in Vienna in mid-November. In Iran, Ramin Mehmanparast, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Tuesday, “Political pressure and sanctions have not prevented Iran from proceeding with its peaceful nuclear activities according to schedule.” “The Bushehr power plant is a major project which will help us to take one step toward future alternative energy supplies,” he said, according to the semiofficial news agency IRNA. “We will also pursue our peaceful nuclear activities in other areas.” Iran has five research reactors in operation, and one more under construction. The Bushehr reactor, designed for power generation and located in southern Iran, has a long and tangled history. Construction began in 1975 under a contract signed with West Germany, state-run Press TV reported on Tuesday, but West Germany withdrew from the project after the Islamic Revolution in 1979. An agreement with Russia in 1995 should have been completed in 1999, but the plan fell prey to long delays. The United States once opposed the plant. But the International Atomic Energy Agency monitors it, and the United States dropped its objections after Russia provided assurances of controls on the fuel supply and the disposal of spent fuel rods. Russia has agreed to take back the spent rods, removing the possibility that Iran could reprocess them for materials that could fuel a nuclear weapon. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton reiterated Tuesday that the United States was not concerned with the Bushehr plant but with other sites. “Our problem is not with their reactor at Bushehr, our problem is with their facilities at places like Natanz and their secret facility at Qum and other places where we believe they are conducting their weapons program,” Mrs. Clinton told reporters at the United Nations, according to The Associated Press. “Iran is entitled to the peaceful use of nuclear power,” she added. “They are not entitled to a nuclear weapons program.” The Iranian government maintains that its program is for energy production and other peaceful uses. But with Iran having hidden elements of the program in the past and making no secret of its ambitions to increase its regional power, Western governments harbor deep suspicions that Tehran wants to build a nuclear weapon. The fuel loading was initially planned to begin soon after fuel was transported there in August, but was delayed by what the Iranians said was a leak in a pool near the central reactor. Iranian officials have denied that the delay was caused by the mysterious Stuxnet computer worm, which was found on the laptop computers of several employees at Bushehr, as well as a power generator that is not believed to be part of a weapons program. Speaking to workers at the plant on Tuesday, the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi, called the Bushehr plant “the most exceptional power plant in the world.” He said that the plant would begin to feed the national power grid within three months. Normal procedures call for I.A.E.A. inspectors to oversee the final processes of fuel-loading and then seal the core of the reactor to prevent tampering. The reactor is to be kept under surveillance by closed-circuit television cameras that would detect any movement of fuel. But in September, the I.A.E.A. complained that Iran had barred two of its most experienced inspectors from the country. In a report, the agency reiterated that, since August 2008, Iran has refused to answer questions “about the possible existence in Iran of past or current undisclosed nuclear-related activities involving military-related organizations, including activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile.” The report said it was “essential that Iran engage with the agency on these issues” because evidence can degrade with “the passage of time.”",2010-10-26T13:21:18.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-middle-east

Credit... David Guttenfelder for The New York Times KYIV, Ukraine — Tensions around the nuclear power plant on the front lines of the war in Ukraine escalated sharply on Thursday, as the Russian and Ukrainian militaries traded charges that each was preparing to stage an attack on the plant in coming days, risking a catastrophic release of radiation. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that the Ukrainian military was preparing a “terrorist attack” on the sprawling Zaporizhzhia power plant complex on the Dnipro river, prompting the Ukrainian military intelligence agency to respond that the Russian warning was in fact a pretext for Moscow to stage a “provocation” of some kind there on Friday. Invading Russian forces seized control of the plant, Europe’s largest nuclear power station, in early March and put it under the control of Rosatom, the Russian state nuclear company. But they have kept Ukrainian staff there — many of them by force, Ukraine claims — to operate it. On Thursday, the Ukrainian intelligence agency said that Rosatom engineers had “urgently” left the plant and that only “operative personnel” would be allowed at the plant on Friday. “Entrance for all other employees will be closed,” it said. An employee at the plant, communicating to The New York Times through a colleague in Kyiv, said that workers were terrified. “The situation is terrible, everyone is scared of tomorrow’s provocations announced by Russia,” said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear for her safety. “Russia’s Defense Ministry said they expect provocations from the Ukrainian side, but we understand perfectly well what that means. Even more people are trying to leave.” A Telegram post from workers at the plant urged the combatants to consider the danger facing its 10,000 workers and warned that a disaster at the plant could be worse than any the world has ever seen, including at Chernobyl and Fukushima: “Think about the future of our Earth, about the future of our and your children! Our planet is so small and it is illogical to assume that it will be possible to hide somewhere from the consequences of a significant nuclear catastrophe.” The fears of a possible attack came even as the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, held talks in the city of Lviv, in western Ukraine, with the Ukrainian and Turkish presidents in an effort to ease military tensions around the site and restart diplomatic engagement to end the nearly six-month-old war. U.N. nuclear regulators have been pleading for access to the plant to ensure its safety. The United Nations has offered to send nuclear inspectors to the site, if both sides agree. In recent weeks, daily shelling at the Zaporizhzhia complex has sparked international concerns about the possibility of a meltdown or release of radiation from spent nuclear fuel in storage. Each side has blamed the other for the shelling on the plant, which is Europe’s largest nuclear power complex, with six reactors on a site occupying about half a square mile. The uncertainty surrounding the security of the plant was underscored by a video that circulated online on Thursday, showing at least five apparent military trucks inside one of the complex’s buildings. By using archival photos of the interior of the different facilities on the premises of the nuclear complex, The Times determined that the videographer walked along a turbine inside the machine room of one of the complex’s six nuclear reactors. Earlier this month, Ukraine released aerial surveillance footage showing several military vehicles driving into one of these buildings.

The highlighted area is roughly the location of the military vehicles seen in the video circulating online on Thursday. Credit...

Residents of Sacramento, Calif., voted Tuesday to shut down their utility's only nuclear power plant, the first time voters have decided to close a working reactor. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District, the public agency that owns the Rancho Seco plant, promptly began shutting it down yesterday after the nuclear industry's $580,000 campaign to keep it open had failed to overcome arguments based less on the environment and safety than on economics: the troubled plant could not provide electricity at competitive cost. The vote, by which the utility district's board had agreed to abide, was 53.4 percent to shut the plant and 46.6 percent to keep it open. That outcome was a setback for an already depressed industry that hopes for a rebirth springing from an increased demand for electrical power in much of the United States and growing concern over the environmental effects of the burning of fossil fuels. The reactor, 25 miles from Sacramento, was built at a cost of $375 million. It has operated fitfully during its 15-year history, producing less than 40 percent of the electricity that would have resulted from unfailing year-round operation and requiring the utility district to double its rates over the last four years to pay for improvements. Opponents of the plant, including two members of the district's five-member board, argued that despite $400 million in new investment in the last three years, it would be far cheaper to retire it now, halfway through its expected life span, and buy power from neighboring utilities in the California market, which is glutted with electricity. Edward A. Smeloff, one of the board members who favored the shutdown, said the utility district was leaning toward ''1970's technology'' to replace the reactor: the installation of boilers fired by natural gas to drive Rancho Seco's existing steam turbines. The fuel cost of using natural gas to generate electricity is about 2.3 cents a kilowatt-hour, Mr. Smeloff said, and for most hours of the day neighboring utilities will sell electricity to Sacramento at fuel cost plus 15 percent. Last year, by comparison, nuclear-generated power from Rancho Seco cost 5.4 cents a kilowatt-hour. In addition to the Rancho Seco plant, the utility owns two geothermal plants, a small solar installation and a plant fired by fossil fuels. But now that Rancho Seco is closing down, the district will be buying more than half its power from neighboring utilities. Backdrop of Safety Concern Although the vote Tuesday centered on economics, it took place against a backdrop of nationwide concern over the safety of nuclear power plants in general, and of local concern over particular problems at Rancho Seco. The reactor's design is nearly identical to that at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, where a severe core-melting accident occurred in March 1979, and Rancho Seco has had accidents of its own. One of these occurred in March 1978, when a worker caused a partial blackout in the control room by dropping a light bulb behind a control panel. The result was to trigger emergency systems that dumped huge volumes of cold water into the hot reactor vessel, creating a danger of cracking. To a greater extent, however, the vote was a popular repudiation of the conventional wisdom about nuclear plants: that they may be expensive to build but, once running, make electricity cheaply. In fact, utility industry statistics now show that the continuing expense of operation, maintenance and fuel is higher for reactors than for coal-fired plants. Opponents of nuclear power, who have lost 14 similar referendums in 10 states during the last 13 years, took heart from the Sacramento outcome. ''This sends a message, a shot heard round the world,'' said Scott Denman, director of the Safe Energy Communication Council. ''This revitalizes and reinvigorates the whole consumer and rate-payer movement with regard to nuclear power.'' The vote was 111,867 in favor of the shutdown and 97,460 opposed, with about 40 percent of registered voters casting ballots. Atomic-power opponents said they had benefited from the fact that all those voting were neighbors of the plant and customers of the utility; in recent defeats for shutdown proposals in Maine and Massachusetts, some voters distant from the reactors were unaffected by the issue of cost. The Industry's Outlook Advocates of atomic power have asserted that looming electricity shortages in the East and increased concern over coal burning's contribution to global warming offer an opportunity for new reactors. But because of local opposition the industry is also fast approaching the abandonment of the Shoreham nuclear plant on Long Island. In addition, the Public Service Company of Colorado announced recently that it would abandon its Fort St. Vrain reactor, which, like Rancho Seco, ran poorly. These developments, combined with Tuesday's vote, raise the possibility that the American nuclear power industry reached its high-water mark recently, at 112 operable reactors, when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave Seabrook, in New Hampshire, a license for low-power testing. But at the Council for Energy Awareness, the industry's trade association, Scott Peters, a spokesman, said that while the Sacramento vote was unfortunate, ''we don't think this interrupts our progress.'' ''It doesn't do anything for the supply problems we seem to be facing in many sections of the country, and it doesn't do anything for pollution,'' he said. ''It worsens pollution.'' The future of Rancho Seco itself is uncertain. The plant cannot be dismantled until a place is found for its spent fuel. The Department of Energy is studying a site in Nevada, at Yucca Mountain, which would be a repository for the highly radioactive wastes of all the nation's nuclear plants. But even the most optimistic projections are that no repository can be ready before the early years of the next century.",1989-06-08T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

The two presidents agreed to work toward organizing a visit by a delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, to the facility, the Kremlin said. Tensions ratcheted up around the plant over the summer, with both sides accusing each other of risking a nuclear disaster by targeting the facility.

They were spurred on when the plant was temporarily shut down early in 1993, and their cause was further strengthened when the reactor went on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's watch list later that year. And even though the July 2 restart has caused many in the anti-nuclear movement to lose heart, they say they have not lost faith. ""We've been through it before, and we'll go through it again,"" said Barbara K. Hickernell, coordinator of the Alliance to Close Indian Point, which represents a confederation of anti-nuclear groups. ""When you're part of a cause like ours, you have to be there for the long haul."" Last month's reactivation of the plant, she said, was ""just another setback for us."" ""It's like a sandlot team trying to fight the Major Leagues,"" she continued, adding, ""A David and Goliath story."" But the protester's ranks have thinned in recent weeks, and fewer of the regulars arrive here on weekends to march. At the plant, though, the mood is decidedly upbeat, managers say, and the worries of environmentalists and other anti-nuclear groups seem far away -- even though Indian Point 3 remains on the regulatory commission's watch list. The Government cited the plant in June 1993 for faulty equipment and procedures and a management style that squelched whistle-blowers. Connie Hogarth, director of the Westchester People's Action Coalition in White Plains, said there was ""a shopping list of problems that would have made your hair stand on end."" She said her organization, which counts 4,000 members, will not be content until the plant closes for good. ""I've opposed Indian Point for 20 years,"" she said, recalling a ""die-in"" held there in 1979 following the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. Ms. Hogarth was arrested for her part in the demonstration -- protesters lay on the ground to symbolize victims of a nuclear meltdown -- and she spent two weeks in jail, where she went on a hunger strike. ""It was the biggest demonstration Westchester had ever seen,"" she said. Today, Federal regulators are taking a ""wait and see"" attitude when it comes to Indian Point 3. And although they acknowledge the improvements that have been made in recent months, they do not plan to remove the plant from the watch list for at least another five months, said Richard J. Urban, a project engineer for the N.R.C. Mr. Urban called Indian Point 3 -- which at full capacity can produce 980,000 kilowatts of electricity, enough energy to light 10 million 100-watt light bulbs -- ""one of the most troublesome plants in the Northeast."" Of 109 operating nuclear plants in the country, only five are on the N.R.C. watch list. Situated 35 miles north of Manhattan, the plant here is owned by the New York Power Authority and employs close to 1,000 workers. But its track record has been poor, and because of a series of problems it has been intermittently shut down for nearly half of its existence. Curtis Cowgill, chief of the Indian Point 3 project for the N.R.C., said that while there had never been the threat of a serious meltdown at the plant, there have been ""ongoing problems"" with surveillance testing and with the backup system for shutting down the reactor. ""They've not been very good at identifying and correcting their problems,"" he said of the plant management, citing declining performance in emergency preparedness, engineering and technical support and safety assessments, among other things. Mr. Urban, who said it would be ""premature"" to take Indian Point 3 off the watch list now, explained that Federal regulators wanted ""to see a sustained operation there."" But Leslie M. Hill, the plant's on-site executive officer, said he was optimistic that Indian Point 3's performance would soon warrant a revision in its status. And while the anti-nuclear groups say they have not lost their faith, Mr. Hill said that neither has he. Workers at the plant had found ""nuclear religion,"" he said. He called management and staff gatherings ""prayer meetings,"" and described himself as ""the preacher at Indian Point 3."" ""We've changed the plant's culture,"" he said, referring to the turn-around in recent months. Nineteen of 27 former managers at Indian Point 3 have been ousted and other procedural changes have been put in place. James Comiotes, general manager of support services, said even the smallest problems were now addressed quickly ""because they could be precursors to bigger problems."" ""We always think that the plant may be trying to tell us something,"" he continued. Also, in its capacity as ""the conscience of the plant,"" a New York Power Authority licensing group now resides here full-time, Mr. Comiotes said. ""We want to find our own problems and fix them, instead of leaving that for the Federal regulators,"" he said. To encourage so-called whistle-blowers, the plant has instituted an anonymous speak-out program, allowing complaints to be filed electronically. The dress code, too, has changed, and Edward N. Maset, general supervisor for buildings and grounds, said that was another harbinger of better things to come. T-shirts and shorts have been replaced with suits, ties, hard hats and safety glasses, he said, noting that coveralls and other protective gear are the rule for radiologically controlled areas, which has not always been the case in the past. And while the N.R.C. is observing the changes with an open mind, anti-nuclear groups say they will never be won over. They see the new management style as no more than window dressing. ""Well, perhaps I would be a believer if I saw improvements for a long, long time,"" said Charles Komanoff, an energy consultant and director of Komanoff Energy Associates in Manhattan. ""But I'm highly doubtful that even a decade from now anyone will be able to justify the reopening of Indian Point 3."" A focus of anti-nuclear protesters' most recent disappointments has been S. David Freeman, the outgoing president of the power authority who had billed himself as ""Dave the Nuke Killer."" Before taking over the New York Power Authority job 18 months ago, Mr. Freeman closed eight plants operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority, along with the Rancho Seco plant in California after performance there failed to improve. The protesters had hoped Mr. Freeman would steer the state toward what environmentalists believe is cleaner and more efficient energy, like solar and wind power, said Paul R. Clarke, the local office director for the New York regional office of the environmental group Greenpeace, which joined with local groups in opposing the reopening of Indian Point 3. A restart at Indian Point 3 was seen by protesters as ""throwing good money after bad,"" said Michael Mariotte, executive director of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service in Washington, a clearinghouse for environmental groups. ""We thought Mr. Freeman would come to realize the plant was a loser,"" he said. When Indian Point 3 is up and running, it generates power for about 4.5 cents an hour -- comparable to other nuclear power plants. By contrast, New York's two hydroelectric plants, in Niagara and Massena, produce energy for 1 to 2 cents a kilowatt hour, said Robert G. Schoenberger, the power authority's chief operating officer. But Mr. Schoenberger said it is hoped that with cost-cutting measures at the plant, power costs will drop to 2.5 cents a kilowatt hour at Indian Point 3, which would be competitive with other power sources. Also, the New York Power Authority and Consolidated Edison, which owns Indian Point 2 and the retired Indian Point 1 here, are considering a plan to share some resources to further reduce costs, Mr. Schoenberger said. Indian Point 1 operated from 1962 to 1974, when it was retired. Indian Point 3 supplies power to New York City, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Westchester County and other public customers. During the most recent period that the plant was down, the Power Authority had to purchase power elsewhere to supply its customers, and it ""ate the costs,"" Mr. Schoenberger said. As the anti-nuclear protesters regroup for their next efforts, they say they will rely less on demonstrations and more on public education and, perhaps, the courts. Nicholas Mottern, an Ossining resident who is a member of the Westchester Environmental Coalition-Indian Point Project, said his organization, which has about 25 members, was considering a lawsuit on the ground that the nuclear plant here violates residents' constitutional rights to ""safety, health and well-being."" He declined to elaborate further. Mr. Mottern and Ms. Hogarth said their groups continued to worry about the leakage of radioactive water from the plant -- most recently in July shortly after start-up -- and its effects on the health of residents who live nearby. The protesters are also challenging what they consider to be inadequate evacuation plans for the area in the event of a serious nuclear accident. Mr. Mariotte of the nuclear watchdog group in Washington said studies by public interest research groups have criticized Westchester's emergency plans. In particular, the studies cite a road system in the northern part of the county that they consider unable to handle a mass evacuation. The county's response to the anti-nuclear groups' criticisms is an 8-inch-thick document detailing evacuation procedures for a 10-mile radius surrounding the two reactors here. Barry D. Bowman, the county's lead public information officer on evacuation procedures, noted that ""a Chernobyl-type incident is considered highly unlikely"" in the region because modern reactors are sealed and have multiple redundant safety systems.",1995-08-20T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Two years after it was the scene of the world's worst nuclear accident, the Chernobyl power station is riddled with negligence and nepotism, Pravda charged today. The Communist Party newspaper said managers of the plant had ignored many of the safety measures ordered after an explosion and fire killed 31 people, contaminated farmland for miles around and sent a radioactive cloud across Europe. Instead, the newspaper said, the plant managers have emphasized power production ''at any cost'' to the detriment of maintenance and repair work. Officials Are Rebuked The newspaper disclosed that the Communist Party had officially rebuked the general director of Kombinat, the organization created to oversee plant operations and the cleanup of the contaminated zone, along with the plant director and others. It accused them of nepotism, financial irregularities and lax discipline. The report referred to Kombinat's chief, Yevgeny Ignatenko, as the ''former general director,'' suggesting that he had been dismissed. Reporters for the authoritative party paper said Kombinat managers had given engineering jobs to unqualified workers, some of them with no higher education, because of their family connections. Drunkenness and Thievery Cited ''Leadership positions were given to people who had criminal records, who had been excluded from the party or had received strict party penalties,'' Pravda said. ''In the Kombinat amalgamation, drunkenness, thievery and violations of labor discipline have not been reduced,'' the report continued. ''Judging from all this, the leadership of Kombinat has not learned a lesson from the past,'' it said. ''It is as though there had been no accident.'' The Pravda report came a week after a visit to Chernobyl by Vladimir I. Dolgikh, a nonvoting member of the ruling Politburo and the party secretary who oversees the energy industry, and it almost certainly reflected concern at the highest level of the party. The litany of management abuses contrasted sharply with the upbeat tone of other articles leading up to the anniversary of the accident on Tuesday. Other articles have focused on the improved training of plant workers, the heroic cleanup of the contaminated area, and the resettlement in newly built towns of many of the 135,000 people who were evacuated from the area around the plant, which is 80 miles north of Kiev, the Ukrainian capital. Pravda said many of the safety measures planned at the station after the accident in the No. 4 reactor had not been carried out because of Kombinat's negligence. Repairs that were carried out were often poorly supervised and equipment was not tested before being brought into service, the newspaper said. The Communist Party chief in the Kiev region was quoted as blaming atomic power officials in Moscow for the continuing neglect, saying ''The U.S.S.R. Ministry of Nuclear Energy is tolerant of gross mistakes in Kombinat's work.'' Pressure From Moscow Hinted The comment suggested that the continuing problems at the plant might have resulted from pressure from Moscow to increase nuclear power output to meet the country's energy needs. The Pravda report is likely to revive speculation about the future of Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, the Communist Party leader in the Ukraine, whose relations with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, are said to be tense. Mr. Shcherbitsky has carefully kept his distance from the Chernobyl controversy in the last two years, and he was not mentioned in today's report. Nuclear power is generally regarded as a federal responsibility. The Chernobyl accident on April 26, 1986, was attributed to workers who shut off key emergency equipment during a test and then ignored warnings that the reactor was out of control. Six former officials were sentenced to labor camps for gross violations of safety regulations. Three of the four reactors at Chernobyl have been restarted, although one of them is temporarily shut down for major repairs. Public Confidence Sags The Chernobyl disaster cast a pall over the Soviet nuclear power program, and it prompted intensive official efforts to restore confidence in atomic energy. Plans for at least two nuclear power stations are known to have been canceled in response to public anxiety attributed to the disaster. In January, the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda disclosed that popular protests had forced cancellation of a nuclear power project near Krasnodar, on the Black Sea, where $41 million had already been spent. The newspaper said most of the other nuclear plants under construction were now ''bitterly opposed'' by local residents. Pravada's article began by reporting improvements in safety equipment, the successful cleanup effort and the restoration of safe radiation levels. Halfway through the article, however, the tone changed to one of sharp criticism. ''Regrettably, we were told at the Kiev regional party committee, where the state of affairs at the Chernobyl nuclear power station is regularly analyzed, that the leadership of the power station emphasizes the operation of the station at any cost, to the detriment of the quality of repair and maintenance of the extremely intricate equipment,'' the paper said.",1988-04-25T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,front-page

But how many? Worries about carbon dioxide and galloping demand for electricity might seem to be setting the stage for a renaissance of nuclear power. But reactors, it turns out, are not at the top of the list for stopping global warming, at least in the United States, at least not any time soon. Among the issues are the cost of nuclear power, fears about safety and questions about how to dispose of waste. Even its boosters say nuclear power is not a short-term solution. In July, for example, Exelon, the nation’s largest nuclear operator and one of its largest electric companies, promised to cut greenhouse gas emissions from its own operations and from smokestacks of its suppliers by 15 million tons a year by 2020. It drew a chart showing how much it could save through efficiency improvements and by switching to natural gas from coal. Strikingly, it omitted from the list any savings from a new nuclear plant, because Exelon did not think it could finish a new plant by 2020. If electric power demand continues to rise, as seems likely, the nuclear power industry will be hard-pressed to maintain its market share, much less displace the main carbon dioxide emitters  plants that burn coal. Simply staying even would mean building another 10 reactors or so a year. There are two opposing viewpoints on expanding nuclear power. One is that most companies will not take the plunge until they have seen the pioneers jump into the sea of challenges  technical, legal and financial  and then surface again; the other is that the time is right to push ahead with a large-scale, sustained construction plan. “We’re still in a situation where pretty much everybody wants to be second,” said Roger W. Gale, a former Energy Department official and now a consultant to utilities, of the first view. In 20 years, he said, someone will have gone first, and the industry will have a better idea of what the costs really are, and how well a new reactor will run. That approach is a recipe for failure, others say. “It’s a scale industry,” said John Krenicki, chief executive of General Electric Energy Infrastructure. “Dabbling will never get you a cost-effective solution,” he said. “If your vision is we’re going to build three nuclear plants, it’s going to be extremely slow and extremely expensive.” Mr. Krenicki and other proponents of a large-scale campaign to build plants say that approach would keep per-plant costs down, because building them serially would allow each project to rapidly take advantage of the knowledge gained from its predecessor. Michael Wallace is one executive who wants to go first. Mr. Wallace is the chairman of UniStar Nuclear Energy, a partnership of Constellation Energy and the French national utility, Électricité de France, which is building a new type of reactor in Flamanville, France. UniStar then hopes to build an almost identical reactor at Calvert Cliffs, Md., about 40 miles south of Washington, and then break ground on one plant a year  in upstate New York, Missouri, eastern Pennsylvania and other locations still to be worked out. The strategy would be like a home builder constructing a subdivision. Instead of building one house, selling it and starting the next, the strategy would be to move the backhoe from lot to lot, dig the foundation, and follow up with the concrete crew, framers, sheet-rockers and painters. In other words, they wouldn’t wait for completion of the first plant to start. “Nuclear presents a not only environmentally preferred technology, but it has fuel sources that make it fairly immune to some of the more unstable areas around the globe,” Mr. Wallace said. “The future uncertainty on coal being so large, nuclear is to be much preferred.” The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry’s trade association, says large-scale construction is possible. In the 1980s, 48 new reactors were licensed to operate, and in the 1970s, it was 58 new reactors, according to the institute. The United States could have 40 or 50 new reactors by 2030, said Richard J. Myers, vice president of policy development at the Energy Institute. But “this assumes the first four or eight just go very nicely and very smoothly,” he said. Congress has promised heavy subsidies for the first few plants, and more will follow if “everybody is comfortable with the technology and the regulatory process and we have the requisite political and regulatory stability, sustained over a period of years,” Mr. Myers said. “It assumes all things go well.” Beyond those assumptions, the world has changed. When Mr. Wallace led the startup at two twin-reactor plants in Illinois  Byron in 1985 and 1987, and Braidwood in 1987  “perhaps 30 plants were under construction all at the same time,” he said. “As best I can remember, all the equipment we used at Byron and Braidwood came from inside the continental United States.” Now, he said, the supply chain is global, and only one manufacturer can make the biggest parts for the reactor vessel for his model plant. If companies line up to build nuclear plants, that line might include builders from every country that wants to expand nuclear power. Few American companies will be in the line. Of the four American companies that sold the bulk of nuclear reactors in the 1960s and 1970s, Westinghouse, the biggest, is now owned by a Japanese company, and General Electric is in a global partnership with a different Japanese company. The other two companies were absorbed by larger players.",2008-09-24T01:29:23.000+02:00,NYTIMES,specialsections-business-day-business

Four of the remaining six monitors left on Monday, according to Ukrainian energy officials. Credit... Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times KYIV, Ukraine — Europe’s largest nuclear power plant was disconnected from the nation’s power grid after renewed shelling nearby on Monday, according to Ukrainian energy officials, once again placing critical cooling systems at risk of relying solely on emergency backup power. Herman Galushchenko, Ukraine’s energy minister, said a fire resulting from the shelling had severed the Zaporizhzhia plant’s last connection to a reserve line that had provided its only source of outside power. Reactor No. 6, the only working reactor at the plant, was still producing power for the facility itself, and as of Monday evening, engineers had not switched on diesel generators, according to an official from Energoatom, the Ukrainian company responsible for operating the facility. Mr. Galushchenko said it was yet another precarious moment made more threatening by the fact that firefighting crews had not been able to reach the site of the blaze. “Any repairs to the lines are now impossible,” he said. “Fighting is taking place around the station.” An International Atomic Energy Agency inspection team that had been at the plant left two monitors behind in the hopes that they could bear witness to events as they unfold and ease tensions at the facility, which is held by Russian forces but is still run by Ukrainian engineers. The larger hope had been that the shelling would stop. The agency said that, according to Ukrainian officials, the reserve line had been “deliberately disconnected in order to extinguish a fire.” “The line itself is not damaged, and it will be reconnected once the fire is extinguished,” the agency, which is part of the United Nations, said. Edwin Lyman, a nuclear power expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group in Cambridge, Mass., said the current situation — in which the plant is relying on one of its own reactors to supply power to cooling systems — was “not unique, but it’s not standard practice.” He noted that the International Atomic Energy Agency, which sets reactor safety standards for nuclear plants, published a technical document in 2018 that details the backup procedure. “Some existing nuclear power plant technologies have this capability,” the I.A.E.A. document said, “while others do not.” Even plants that have the capability, it noted, may face “a time limit, generally of a few hours,” for the backup power. Najmedin Meshkati, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Southern California, said the loss of offsite power — which has happened at the Zaporizhzhia plant at least twice in the last few weeks — was “one of the most dreadful events that could happen to a nuclear plant.” Dr. Meshkati, who was a member of the committee appointed by the United States’ National Academy of Sciences to identify lessons from the disaster at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan, said that it did not make sense for the reactor to be running. An engineer in contact with people at the plant and in the satellite town of Enerhodar said on Monday that her colleagues had reported severe shelling in the area over the past three days. “Residential houses have been damaged, and there are many more people injured and killed than reported in the Ukrainian media,” said the engineer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she feared reprisals against her friends and family. “People continue leaving the town, including the plant’s employees.” Ukrainian officials sought to keep up pressure on the International Atomic Energy Agency to offer a robust assessment of both the conditions at the plant and the challenges facing the Ukrainian engineers charged with its safe operation. Repeated shelling over the past month has damaged all of the plant’s connections to four high-voltage external power lines, forcing it to use a lower-voltage reserve line to power the cooling equipment needed to prevent meltdowns. It was that reserve line that was cut off on Monday. When the main power lines and the reserve line were damaged by shelling and fires on Aug. 25, a blackout at the plant forced it to rely on diesel generators to prevent a disaster. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said at a news conference on Friday that his biggest concern regarding the physical safety of the facility was related to a reliable connection to external power.

The head of the United Nations’ atomic watchdog expressed astonishment on Thursday about international complacency over safety at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, where several hours earlier Russian shelling had again cut power to the plant and left workers resorting to using backup generators to maintain safety. It was the sixth time the Zaporizhzhia facility, Europe’s largest nuclear plant, needed to move to its emergency power supply since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine a year ago, according to Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. watchdog. He described the use of generators there as the “last line of defense” against a possible nuclear accident. In a fiery statement to the agency’s board of governors on Thursday, Mr. Grossi urged immediate action to restore security at the plant, which Russian forces occupied shortly after invading the country a year ago. “What are we doing?” he said, according to the agency. “How can we sit here in this room this morning and allow this to happen? This cannot go on.” He added, “I am astonished by the complacency.” “Each time, we are rolling a dice,” Mr. Grossi said, “and if we allow this to continue time after time, then one day our luck will run out.” The board, which decides policy for the organization, is made up of 35 member states including Russia, according to the agency’s website. Russian shelling early Thursday cut the external power lines that supply electricity to the plant’s six reactors, according to Ukraine’s state nuclear company, Energoatom. The company said the plant had a supply of diesel to power the generators for 10 days, although the I.A.E.A., which has stationed inspectors at the plant, said there was enough fuel for 15 days. Bringing additional diesel supplies across the front line in the southern Zaporizhzhia region is extremely difficult, and Energoatom warned of the danger of not having enough power for the facility, whose equipment to prevent a radiation leak requires a constant source of fuel, even with all of the reactors offline. “If it is impossible to renew the external power supply of the station during this time, an accident with radiation consequences for the whole world may occur,” the company said on Telegram. External power to the plant was last cut off in November, Mr. Grossi said. Each time the power source to the plant has been severed, engineers have raced to make repairs before the plant’s 18 diesel generators run out of fuel. International nuclear inspectors have repeatedly called the situation unsustainable and precarious. The U.N. atomic agency has spent months trying to forge an agreement between Moscow and Kyiv to establish a safety and security zone around the plant. But Ukraine’s energy minister said this week that talks were at a dead end because Russia had refused his government’s demand to withdraw from the plant and hand control of it back to Energoatom. Moscow has placed the plant under the control of its own state nuclear company, Rosatom. The predawn shelling on Thursday came as Russia launched missile and drone attacks across Ukraine as part of a monthslong campaign to damage the country’s power infrastructure. Since Moscow’s troops began occupying the Zaporizhzhia facility, it has been hit by rocket fire, which at one point damaged an area where spent nuclear fuel is stored. There have also been multiple reports of shells landing in and near the plant’s grounds. Russian forces have also set up machine-gun posts at the plant, Energoatom said this week. The Ukrainian authorities say that some of the Ukrainian workers who remain there have been interrogated and that at least one had been killed by Russian forces.",2023-03-09T13:31:20.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Even if such a release did occur, they said, its dangers would be minimal to people in the United States and other countries bordering the Atlantic. They also said there was no danger of a nuclear explosion either in the reactor or in the nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles aboard the submarine. Not a Bottled-Up Bomb A nuclear missile, to detonate, must be armed, and cannot be set off by a fire or a jarring, such as might occur in a collision, the experts said. They noted that Soviet and American submarine commanders are under orders not to arm the missiles unless they are about to be used. And contrary to a widely held belief, it is physically impossible for a nuclear reactor to explode in the sense that a nuclear bomb blows up, the experts said, though smaller chemical explosions of nuclear fuel are possible in a fire or runaway chain reaction. ''In a reactor, military or commercial, it's physically not possible for there to be a nuclear explosion,'' said Mark Mills, the president of Science Concepts Inc., an energy and technology consulting firm in Washington. ''It's not a bomb that's bottled up.'' ''It's not appropriate to talk of nuclear explosions - that, I believe, is not a realistic thing,'' said A. David Rossin, Assistant Secretary of Energy for nuclear energy. He said it was ''entirely possible'' that Soviet assurances that there was no danger of explosion or contamination were correct. Gene R. La Rocque, a retired United States Navy rear admiral who is the director of the Center for Defense Information in Washington, also said that there was no likelihood of a nuclear explosion from a fire aboard the Soviet submarine. It was a chemical explosion of nuclear fuel - and not an atomic blast -that occurred in a runaway chain reaction at a nuclear power plant at Chernobyl, in the Soviet Ukraine, last spring, when a large radioactive plume spread over Soviet territory and much of Europe. Ocean, Too, Is a Safeguard A release of radiation from the Soviet submarine would have occurred only if the ship's reactor core, where enriched plutonium or uranium fuel is stored, had been breached, said Mr. Mills, a physicist. But in that case, he said, the submarine would probably have sunk and the radiation would be so diluted by the ocean that it would pose no danger to the East Coast of the United States, more than 1,000 miles to the west, or to other lands. Both Mr. Mills and Mr. Rossin stressed that they were speaking in general about the physics of nuclear energy and the design of nuclear safety systems and had no specific information on the accident aboard the Soviet submarine or on the design or safety systems of nuclear subs. The creation of a nuclear explosion, Mr. Mills said, is an elaborate and delicate process that is easily sidetracked. ''Accidents, sabotage - these things take it away from the physical realm of what it requires to cause an explosion,'' he said. No Potential to Explode By analogy, he said, there is a chemical energy in grain than can explode under certain circumstances - blasts occur in grain elevators, for example. But once grain has been processed into bread, he said ''you can't do anything to the bread to make it explode.'' Similarly, Mr. Mills said, uranium and plutonium that is processed into fuel for the operation of nuclear power plants no longer has the potential to explode in the way that a nuclear bomb explodes. Because of the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979, and the incident at Chernobyl this year, many people confuse the possibility of chemical explosions at nuclear power plants with the idea of a nuclear explosion. ''It's a semantic convenience,'' Mr. Mills said. ''But it can't happen. I've seen surveys saying that somewhere between half and 80 percent of the public believes that a reactor can explode like a nuclear bomb. The simple reality is that it's impossible.'' Similarly, he said, there is a widespread erroneous impression that nuclear missiles are ''trivial devices to make.'' In reality, they are highly sophisticated and in land-based silos and nuclear submarines are not armed until ready for use. ''A fire or a jarring collision will not set one off,'' Mr. Mills said. ''It's not like nitroglycerin,'' he added, referring to a highly volatile explosive. Chances of Release Slight The chance that a large amount of radiation was released in the Soviet submarine accident is slight, Mr. Mills said, and might have occurred only ''if the reactor's core were exposed, if there was a hole in the sub and it sank.'' In that event, the vast waters of the North Atlantic would ''provide immense dilution, so that the risk would be extremely small.'' He added, ''Nobody would be happy, but the reality is the ocean is so immense that the radiation would be diluted extremely rapidly.'' While Mr. Mills said he did not know the design of the Soviet submarine's reactor, he said ''the odds are good that it's an extremely simple device'' as nuclear power plants go, a container with enriched plutonium or uranium fuel whose chain reactions are started and stopped with control rods dipped in and pulled out. What is complicated about a reactor, he said, is not the core but the system for transferring the generated energy to power systems. ''The submarine reactor is a greater pot for melting,'' he said. ''Its energy concentration is higher. It generates more heat for its size than a land-based nuclear power plant. But safety systems are designed to encompass that.'' Mr. Rossin noted that American nuclear submarines - and presumably Soviet nuclear submarines as well -were built with many compartments separated by steel walls as a safeguard against fire, collision and other disaster. ''Any nuclear ship would have fire protection of some kind, and it is entirely possible that the fire was nowhere near the reactor or the missiles,'' Mr. Rossin said. While the Soviet Government provided few details on the accident, Mr. Rossin said it was ''healthy'' that Moscow acknowledged it promptly and gave assurances that there was no danger of a nuclear explosion or of radioactive contamination. ''The important thing is that the Soviets did notify the rest of the world,'' he said.",1986-10-05T06:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world

The nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, has been entangled in a power struggle between Russia and Ukraine for months. Recurring shelling near the plant, which was seized by Russian forces in March but is still run by Ukrainian engineers, has raised concerns about a catastrophic meltdown, and the Kremlin’s announcement Wednesday that it would “nationalize” the plant has introduced even more uncertainty. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in a statement Wednesday that he was traveling to Kyiv to discuss the status of the plant; he was expected to provide updates on the situation at a news conference later on Thursday.

The protective containment vessels on nearly one-quarter of the nation's commercial nuclear reactors should be modified to reduce the risk of rupture in a major accident, the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Thursday. But the staff, in making the recommendation to the commission, said the containment vessels on these reactors, all built by the General Electric Company, posed no immediate danger to public health or safety. The commission took no action and said it would meet soon with an advisory panel that said the modifications were unjustified. Victor Stello, the commission's executive director of operations, told the commissioners that the modifications would cost about $150 million for all 24 plants involved and that the financial burden would be more than offset by safety gains. He added, ''We do not believe there is any particular problem that requires precipitous action.'' The containment vessels built by General Electric have been singled out for attention by the commission because studies have shown them to be more vulnerable to failure in a reactor accident than other containment systems. A failure could lead to the release of dangerous amounts of radioactivity. Lando W. Zech, the commission chairman, suggested that pressure to act quickly could lead to new safety problems.

As you note, President Trump’s “glib talk about nuclear weapons and his impulsiveness” constitute reason to scrutinize this power. Virtually any first use of nuclear weapons would constitute an act of war. International law prohibits their use except to address a threat that is “instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.” Our Constitution imposes a further constraint. Absent an actual or imminent attack, the president must seek prior congressional authorization to initiate war. Congress has not authorized use of force against North Korea. Nor does the president’s status as commander in chief carry a right to declare or commence war. If that were so, the power of Congress to declare war and the constitutional check on unilateral action would be meaningless. In light of the threat that nuclear weapons pose, further constraints may be appropriate. But existing laws already limit the president’s power to use them. JOHN KIERNAN, MARK R. SHULMAN NEW YORK The writers are, respectively, president of the New York City Bar Association and the chairman of its Task Force on National Security and the Rule of Law. To the Editor: In view of the devastation that would result from nuclear war, there is an obvious need for checks on the president’s authority to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike. That need will continue in the future, regardless of who occupies the Oval Office. Moreover, this is an international problem: The world would be a safer place if all nuclear-weapon states took steps to limit the authority of their civilian and military leaders to launch a pre-emptive nuclear attack. Verification of any international agreement would be difficult, but the process of negotiating it could lead to safer procedures in other capitals. Making this an international process should also make new checks on presidential authority more palatable to the president. LAWRENCE FINCH, CARMEL, CALIF. The writer, a retired Foreign Service officer, served with the United States delegation to the comprehensive test ban negotiations in Geneva in the Carter administration. To the Editor: There is a clean solution to prevent a trigger-happy president from launching a nuclear attack: a declaration by the United States of no first use of nuclear weapons, backed by federal law. In the absence of verifiable evidence of first use by another party, no first strike could be ordered. Earlier advocacy of no first use was not against a rogue nuclear state like North Korea, so it is legitimate to ask whether no first use might undermine the deterrent capability of the United States. If North Korea launched a nuclear attack against South Korea, Japan or even the United States, it would face a devastating retaliatory response, and its leadership knows it. There is no evidence that Kim Jong-un is suicidal. What about deterring a major power like Russia or China? Because of the United States’ strong second-strike capability, no first use will remain effective against major powers. There is no good reason for the United States to remain a laggard. The adoption of no first use might well induce other nuclear states to choose it, which could lead to a new equilibrium: an effective ban on the use of nuclear weapons. STEVEN J.

The ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe brings to an end a long, bitter dispute between the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel and German power companies on the decision in 2011 to abandon nuclear power in the wake of the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan . In 1988, Germany began transforming its energy sector to one powered largely by renewable sources like wind, solar and biomass. Progressively shutting down the country’s nuclear reactors over time had been part of the original plan. In the months before Fukushima, Ms. Merkel’s center-right government had extended the life of several reactors, citing their use as a so-called bridge technology to ensure a stable flow of power through the grid. But the government changed course after the Fukushima disaster in March 2011, taking eight reactors out of service and accelerating plans to close the remaining nine by 2022, earlier than originally scheduled. The energy companies E.On, RWE and Vattenfall sued the government for compensation estimated at 19 billion euros, or about $20.2 billion at current exchange rates, for losses incurred as a result of the decision to move up the deadline, and they questioned the legality of the decision. At the time, nuclear power accounted for 23 percent of electricity in Germany, leaving the companies with energy they could not sell in the months after reactors were taken offline. In addition, the companies were saddled with costs for processing and storing waste from the reactors, projected to total €23.6 billion. The court ordered the government and the power companies to reach an agreement on the compensation by 2018, but it gave no guidance on an amount. Even as the legal dispute simmered, Germany moved ahead with the transformation of its energy sector. In 2015, when the nuclear reactor at Grafenrheinfeld , in Bavaria, was shuttered — the most recent to be taken offline — renewable sources produced 29 percent of all electricity in Germany, government figures showed. The country’s move away from nuclear power comes as it aims to increase production of energy from renewable sources to at least 35 percent, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent of 1990 levels, all by 2020. The transition to renewable energy is projected to create about 430,000 new jobs by 2020, PricewaterhouseCoopers said in a report this month. Ms. Merkel has indicated that she will use her country’s term as president of the Group of 20, which began last week, to continue to push for increased use of renewable energy around the world as a way to fight climate change. “Of course I’ll say that I believe that climate change is certainly caused by humans,” Ms. Merkel told delegates at a party meeting in Münster, Germany, the daily newspaper Bild reported. “And we’ll want to see if the position there develops.”",2016-12-06T16:47:59.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-europe

The shipment, the 33d in a series that began in September, closed one of the last phases of a $180 million state-sponsored decommissioning project that began in June 1992, when Governor Mario M. Cuomo pushed a button activating an underwater torch that cut a connection to the reactor's pressure vessel. The project is to conclude by early next year. At 8:15 this morning, as officials of the Long Island Power Authority, and the New York Power Authority held a brief ceremony, a tugboat towed the 175-foot barge into Long Island Sound. ""We've exorcised the Devil,"" said Irving Like, an opponent of the plant since the mid-1960's and a trustee of the Long Island Power Authority, which now owns the plant. The fuel, sealed inside a 70-ton steel container, was to travel around Montauk Point to Delaware Bay, where it was to be transported by train to a nuclear power plant in Limerick, Pa. The Philadelphia Electric Company, Limerick's owner, was paid $45 million to accept the fuel, which it will reuse. The opening of Shoreham was widely opposed on Long Island because of fears that evacuation would be impossible in a serious accident. ""It was a damn-fool idea ever to put a nuclear power plant on Long Island,"" said S. David Freeman, the president and chief executive officer of the New York Power Authority, who attended the ceremony today. ""Common sense just didn't have a seat at the table."" Today's final shipment occurred exactly 15 years after 600 people were arrested during an anti-Shoreham demonstration in which 15,000 people took part. An organizer of the protest, Esther S. Pank, said today: ""I believed 15 years ago that we would stop this plant. People on Long Island didn't give up, and they won."" As the Power Authority officials spoke today, about 75 workers on the decommissioning project listened without enthusiasm. A Lilco employee who did not give his name said most of the workers on the decommissioning job were happy for the work, but unhappy that Shoreham never opened. ""The whole thing was a waste,"" he said. Mr. Freeman said: ""It's not really a happy occasion. There was that certain arrogance in the nuclear industry. We've forgotten now how completely oblivious to public safety the nuclear industry was. Now everybody has sobered up."" The Long Island Power Authority plans public hearings this summer on whether to proceed with a project to convert Shoreham into a gas-powered generator.",1994-06-04T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Credit... Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York Times The U.N.’s nuclear watchdog agency will implement a plan this week to station inspectors at each of Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants in a bid to reduce the chances of a nuclear accident amid the country’s war with Russia. “As this tragic war enters its second year, we must continue to do everything we can to avert the danger of a serious nuclear accident that would cause even more suffering and destruction for the people of Ukraine and beyond,” the agency’s director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said in a statement issued on Friday. He said he would visit Ukraine this week, the latest in a series of trips. Most of the attention on the country’s nuclear sector during the conflict has focused on the Zaporizhzhia facility, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, which is occupied by Russian forces and became an effective battle zone over the summer. Russian forces used the plant’s grounds to fire rockets at nearby towns and cities, according to Ukrainian authorities, while both sides have blamed each other for a series of explosions at the sprawling site that have forced engineers to shut down the plant’s six reactors. Inspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is based in Vienna, have been stationed at the Zaprorizhzhia plant since September. But Ukraine has three other plants in Rivne, South Ukraine and Khmelnytskyi, and the agency aims to station experts at all of them. “Our nuclear safety and security experts will monitor the situation at the plants, assess their equipment and other needs, provide technical support and advice, and report their findings to IAEA headquarters,” Mr. Grossi said in the statement. The agency said it planned to stage 11 or 12 of its experts in the country at any given time. The agency would also have a permanent presence at Chernobyl, the closed plant in northern Ukraine that, in 1986, was the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident. Russian forces occupied Chernobyl for several weeks shortly after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February. In October, Russia began a campaign to cripple Ukraine’s energy sector by hitting power plants and other infrastructure with long range missiles and exploding drones. In November, Ukrainian authorities simultaneously disconnected all four nuclear plants from the country’s power grid as a precaution after Russian attacks damaged the energy systems that supplied them. Ukraine’s state energy company, Energoatom, said in a statement on Saturday that Russia was stationing troops and munitions in the basements of residential buildings in Enerhodar, a city near the Zaprorizhzhia nuclear plant that serves as home to many of the plant’s workers. In a statement on the Telegram social messaging app, Energoatom decried the move, adding that Russian forces knew that Ukraine would be reluctant to target residential buildings for fear of killing civilians. Some military experts say that Ukraine could launch its next offensive in Zaporizhzhia Province with the aim of recapturing the southern city of Melitopol, putting pressure on the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia has controlled since 2014, and severing a land bridge that Moscow has established along the Ukrainian coast from Crimea to the Donbas region in the east of the country. To forestall that possibility, according to witnesses and military experts, Russia has been ferrying reinforcements into the part of Zaporizhzhia close to the nuclear plant. In his statement, Mr. Grossi said that an IAEA plan to establish a safety and security zone around Zaporizhzhia was “making progress, albeit not as fast as they should” and that he would hold talks on the matter with senior Ukrainian officials. Mr. Grossi has also held talks in Moscow about the plan.",2023-01-16T17:20:18.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

More than 100 plants under construction were abandoned in the 1970's and 80's because of their cost. But the idea that an operating nuclear plant is not competitive with other sources of electricity violates the fundamental logic of nuclear power, which is that plants may be expensive to build but are cheap to run. ""It used to be that everyone said, once you built it, there wasn't any question that costs were lower,"" said Victor Gilinsky, an energy consultant and former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ""Now they are more expensive to run than other plants."" Aging Steam Generators In the next few years, at least 10 utilities will need to replace steam generators, which are giant heat exchangers that have shown a tendency to rust and crack, said Gary R. Doughty, an expert on plant life extension with the Nielsen Wurster Group, a consulting firm in Hartford. The job generally runs about $150 million for each reactor. Other utilities face questions about the condition of their reactor vessels, the great steel pots that hold the fuel. Years of bombardment by neutrons, the subatomic particles that sustain a chain reaction, are known to make metal more brittle, but the extent of the problem is not clear. Some utilities that operate a single reactor may be tempted to pull the plug, he said, because that would allow elimination of an entire division. In Rowe, Mass., the owners of the 32-year-old Yankee Rowe reactor decided in February that the plant was too small and too old to justify the investment needed to keep it in service, given the general power surplus in its region. Southern California Edison reached a similar judgment recently about its 24-year-old San Onofre 1 plant near San Clemente, although the plant has not yet been shut. And last year the Sacramento Municipal Utility District decided to shut the Rancho Seco plant as uneconomic at the age of 15. Others around the country were retired in earlier years, some at even younger ages. With only a handful of additional plants likely to be finished and no new ones on order, the result could be an accelerated march to the extinction of nuclear power in the United States. Currently, 108 are operating, producing about 20 percent of the nation's electricity. Some of those, however, are doing very well; in 1991, 25 plants set records for themselves in the number of kilowatt-hours produced. John F. Ahearne, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and now the director of Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society, said that plants that were not economic were more likely to be shut now than they would have been a few years ago. In the last 10 years, he said, the utilities have come to be dominated by business managers, replacing what he called ""technologists,"" or ""people who were committed to nuclear power because they thought it was just a good thing for this country."" The Bottom Line In the view of the business managers, he said, ""the role of a utility is to make money."" They are the people who canceled over-budget reactor construction projects in the 1980's, he said, and they are willing to shut plants now if there are cheaper alternatives. The price of oil, which is currently low, plays a small role in keeping the electricity market highly competitive, especially in places like New York, which uses oil for about 20 percent of electricity generation. But nationally, electricity made from oil is less than 5 percent of total generation. Natural gas plays a far larger role, because it represents about 10 percent of the utilities' fuel use nationally, and about half the generators recently completed or under construction use natural gas. On the basis of energy content, natural gas prices have been substantially below oil prices recently. In addition, overall demand for power has been driven down by recession and by conservation measures, with utilities often subsidizing customers' installation of light bulbs, motors and other devices that will do the same work with less power. Price May Rise Some experts believe that as the economy turns around, the demand for power will rise and hence its price. In addition, requirements of the new Clean Air Act will raise the cost of coal-fired power, and if the United States institutes a carbon tax in the next few years to stave off global warming, that would make nuclear power more competitive, too. Experts are not sure how many nuclear plants will shut in this decade. The chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Ivan Selin, said in a telephone interview that three or four were vulnerable soon. Mr. Ahearne said it could be 10 by the end of the decade. Mr. Selin said it was unlikely that any utility would decide to close a plant that was running smoothly and was not in immediate need of any big investment. But if a plant required a large investment, he said, ""that could push it over the brink."" In that category he put the Consumers Power Company's Palisades plant, near South Haven, Mich., which opened in 1971, where the pressure vessel may now be brittle, the same weakness that was suspected at Yankee Rowe; Consumers Power's Big Rock Point plant, in Charlevoix, Mich., opened in 1965, which has no known significant flaws but is by far the smallest still operating, and Rochester Gas and Electric's Robert E. Ginna plant, near Rochester, which opened in 1970 and faces the expensive replacement of its steam generators. All those plants are old and fairly small. Mr. Selin said it was far from clear whether the problem would extend into the large plants that entered service in the mid-1970's. But it might, he said in a telephone interview. ""There are two ways of looking at it,"" Mr. Selin said. ""You can say each is different, and there is no trend, or you can say there's an underlying trend here. The financial people are beginning to worry about an underlying trend."" In fact, Lehman Brothers organized a conference for utility investors last month on the question of whether old plants were still economic. It drew two dozen investment managers. The Utility Data Institute, a firm in Washington that charts operating costs, reported recently that in 1990 fuel, operating and maintenance expenses at nuclear plants came to $21.89 for one thousand kilowatt-hours produced, about as much electricity as a typical household uses in two months. At a coal plant, the fuel, operating and maintenance cost for the same amount of energy was $20.24. The coal cost was up slightly in 1990 and the nuclear cost down compared with 1989, but nuclear has exceeded coal for the last several years. Those figures are an average for all nuclear plants, meaning that some are significantly higher. Relicensing a Question The old reactors have a variety of factors working against them. Mr. Doughty of Nielsen Wurster pointed out that a plant that was nearing the expiration of its 40-year operating license and needed major investments would have to face the economics of amortizing the expenses over the few remaining years of operation. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has established a policy for granting license extensions, but no plant has yet applied and no one is sure how easy it will be to get one. Carl A. Goldstein, a spokesman for the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, the nuclear industry's public relations arm, said that more plants would probably be found to be uneconomic, but that the point at which a plant should be written off could not be defined until the Nuclear Regulatory Commission made clearer what would be required for a plant to be re-licensed. And nuclear economics could improve, he said, because plant operating and maintenance expenses could decline. Mr. Doughty said that investing new money still made good sense for most plants, but that he feared that reactors with 6,000 megawatts of capacity, or about 6 percent of the nation's total nuclear capacity, would shut in the next few years. Reason to Stay Open How much is ultimately closed may depend on how state rate regulators handle the costs, said Peter Bradford, the chairman of the Public Service Commission in New York and also a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Mr. Bradford, a speaker at the Lehman Brothers session, said a utility with a large investment in a reactor might seek to keep it running so it could continue to collect depreciation, even if cheaper power were available elsewhere. That, he said, would create a conflict between the interest of customers, who would want the plant closed, and the interest of the utility, which would want to let it run. The solution, he said, would be to allow utilities to write off plants that had become economically obsolete, and collect the investment from customers. ""Otherwise, the utility doesn't have the incentive to make the right decision,"" he said.",1992-04-14T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,front-page

But, guarded by 30,000 police officers in postwar Germany's biggest security operation, a train carrying nuclear waste to temporary storage in the middle of Germany neared its goal today at a brisk 45 miles an hour. Still, at least 10,000 protesters awaited the nuclear waste containers for the final, snail's-pace stage of their journey by road on Tuesday to the storage sites at Gorleben -- concluding an annual nuclear pilgrimage that has become part magnet for defiance of the authorities and part token of Germans' deep concern over the perils of atomic power. The train is carrying six containers of spent nuclear fuel from the southwestern town of Walheim to Dannenberg in the north, where the waste is to be loaded on trucks for the 12-mile final stage to the Gorleben interim storage depot east of Hanover. Police officials and some politicians maintain that, along with peaceful demonstrators, the protest, which has grown every year since the transport of nuclear waste to Gorleben started three years ago, has drawn others who see the occasion as a pretext for violent confrontation. Nonetheless, the protest against the train and road convoy, which carried nuclear waste from several German power stations and from a reprocessing plant at La Hague in France, is also depicted by environmentalists as a reflection of broad opposition in Germany to nuclear power. Today demonstrators dug holes in the road on the route of the convoy and blocked highways with tractors. To counter protests, the police deployed water cannon and helicopters. Seven police officers were hurt, one of them seriously, when a water cannon in a procession of police vehicles on its way to Gorleben collided with a patrol car. The cost of the police deployment is estimated at more than $40 million. ''The problem is that too many people have got involved in this and want to pursue their own agenda with violence to draw attention to themselves,'' said Gerhard Glogowski, the Interior Minister of Lower Saxony State. The opposition Green Party maintains that the issue is not so much the transport of nuclear waste as the use of nuclear power in general. ''There is only one alternative -- to abolish nuclear power in the face of popular protest,'' said Gunda Roestel, a leader of the Greens. The authorities have banned all demonstrations along the entire route taken by the nuclear waste train and road convoy, but that has had little effect on the readiness of some protesters to try to block its progress. Near Gottingen today, the 17-car, 1,900-ton train was held up for 20 minutes when protesters slipped through a line of police officers in riot gear and clambered onto the tracks in front of it. As the train began its journey today, 172 protesters were briefly detained, then released, the police said. In one protest, demonstrators described by the police as militants set off a pipe bomb near a railroad at Hanau. No injuries were reported. The nuclear waste is being transported in specially constructed containers, known as castors -- the acronym for the English words Cask for Storage and Transport of Radioactive Material -- whose outer shell is made of seamless cast iron. The containers, which are monitored for radioactive seepage, are said by German authorities to be capable of storing radioactive materials safely for tens of thousands of years. Protests have been gathering since last week, when protesters sabotaged rail tracks. Joschka Fischer, the national leader of the Green Party, said, ''It is irresponsible to carry on with nuclear energy when we don't know what to do with waste.''",1997-03-04T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,world

The Government acted to help allay public concern over its belated disclosure that France suffered much higher doses of radioactivity than normal after the accident. French nuclear officials asserted for two weeks after the accident April 26 that France had been virtually spared from dangerous increases in radiation levels because of its location and prevailing winds. They acknowledged over the weekend that some parts of the country had suffered radioactivity 400 times higher than normal. Alain Madelin, Minister of Industry, Telecommunications and Tourism, said the commission would not be permanent, but only a temporary structure to address questions raised by the Chernobyl disaster. Mr. Madelin acknowledged that there had been a ''problem in the translation of information'' and pledged that nuclear data would be presented more clearly. But he defended French nuclear officials, saying they had ''done their jobs.'' At no time, he stressed, were French citizens jeopardized by the amount of radioactivity they received after the accident in the Ukraine. Radiation Is Termed Lower Pierre Pellerin, director of the French Radiation Protection Service, said Monday that radiation levels had returned to normal. But publication of the figures so belatedly has touched off a sharp debate and charges that French nuclear officials engaged in a cover-up to allay public concern about nuclear safety and France's heavy investment in nuclear power. About 65 percent of France's electrical power is generated by this country's 46 nuclear reactors. Edouard Bonnefous, head of the Finance Committee of the French Senate, demanded on Monday that the Government open an ''emergency'' debate in Parliament on the effects of the Chernobyl disaster. He insisted that Alain Carignon, Deputy Minister of the Environment, ''state promptly in detail what radiation levels have been in France in recent days and what measures should be taken to avoid indirect contamination of imported food products.'' Critics of the Government derided the new committee as a meaningless gesture. ''We already have two Government-run commissions to monitor nuclear safety,'' said Guy Marimot, spokesman for France's Green Party, which is critical of nuclear power. ''What we need is an independent commission of non-Government experts with access to reliable information and the resources to inform the public in a timely fashion.'' Greens Call on Aide to Quit The Greens, who received only 1.6 percent of the vote in the parliamentary elections in March, also demanded the resignation of Mr. Pellerin and an immediate halt to the construction of new nuclear plants. About 5,000 antinuclear activists protested on Saturday night outside the site of a planned nuclear plant at Plouezec, in western France. It was one of the largest antinuclear protests in France, where nuclear power has appeared to enjoy relatively strong support compared with other European countries. On Sunday, 10,000 West German and French demonstrators joined in a joint protest at Fessenheim, France, near the Rhine. The police quelled protesters with dogs, tear gas and truncheons. The focus of the debate in France has not been the Government's commitment to nuclear power, which began in earnest in 1973 under President Georges Pompidou, a conservative, and has continued under President Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist. What has come under fire is the Government's information policy. ''The Government's attitude toward informing its public is far closer to that of the Soviet Union than that of the United States,'' said Pierre Lellouche, associate director of the French Institute for International Relations. 'State Within a State' Mr. Lellouche and other analysts stressed that France has a tradition of centralized power, especially regarding information about atomic energy in the civilian or military sectors. The French Commission on Atomic Energy, which is responsible for nuclear power, has been a ''state within a state'' since its creation, Mr. Lellouche said. ''There has long been a consensus among the elite that France has no choice but nuclear deterrence and nuclear energy,'' he said. ''So anything that threatens to shake public confidence or the shallow public consensus in either is covered up.'' A result, Mr. Lellouche and other analysts said, is the current backlash. Mr. Pellerin has denied charges of a cover-up. He said his commission had issued more than 200 communiques to news agencies since the Chernobyl accident. But Agence France-Presse said it had received only a dozen communiques, all of which it published. The agency noted that each said that the doses of radioactivity stemming from the Soviet accident were 10 to 1,000 times less than levels considered dangerous, and that no additional safety measures were required. On May 6 the Minister of Agriculture issued a communique, based on data from the Radiation Protection Service, saying that French territory, because of its location, had been totally spared by radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl accident. May 1 was the day in which France, and the eastern part of the country near Alsace in particular, received its highest levels of radiation. Last Friday night France announced a ban on the importation from Eastern Europe of fresh meat, fish, vegetables, milk and milk products and chided other European countries for not taking action sooner.",1986-05-14T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world

Mr. Kim presented what North Korea’s state media called an “ambitious blueprint” for his impoverished yet nuclear-armed country on Saturday, the second day of the Seventh Congress of his ruling Workers’ Party, the first such gathering in 36 years. Mr. Kim said that his country’s dealings with the outside world should be based on the fact that it has become a nuclear power — a status the United States has repeatedly vowed to not recognize. “Our party and government will struggle to root out the danger of nuclear war being imposed on us by the United States, based on our strong nuclear deterrent and defend peace in the region and in the world,” Mr. Kim said. His speech was carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency on Sunday. Mr. Kim said North Korea would act like “a responsible nuclear power” by not using a nuclear weapon unless its sovereignty is violated. “We will comply sincerely with our international commitment to nuclear nonproliferation and strive to achieve the denuclearization of the world,” he said. Mr. Kim also said his country was willing to improve ties with hostile countries if North Korea is treated with respect and as a friend. Mr. Kim’s comments appeared in line with what outside analysts have said has been shaping up as North Korean policy in recent years. The analysts also said North Korea wants the United States to accept it as a nuclear power and sign a peace treaty in exchange for a commitment not to grow its nuclear arsenal or export nuclear weapons knowledge. North Korea has indicated in recent years that it can discuss its nuclear disarmament only in the context of global denuclearization. But Washington has insisted it can start dialogue with Pyongyang only when it agrees that it will abandon its nuclear weapons program. But senior North Korean officials attending the party congress vowed to expand their country’s nuclear arsenal, and claimed an ability to strike the United States with nuclear weapons. “Our means of nuclear strikes are ready to launch any time, targeting American imperialists’ bases of invasion in the Asia-Pacific region and the mainland United States,” Vice Marshal Ri Myong-su, the chief of the Korean People’s Army’s General Staff, said on Saturday. Vice Marshal Ri, one of Mr. Kim’s top aides, said that if there were an order from Mr. Kim, his military would launch nuclear strikes to “liberate” South Korea and “completely erase the United States off the face of the earth.” North Korea had previously made similar threats and claims about its nuclear capabilities. But remarks by senior officials during the congress showed that Mr. Kim was using the rare political gathering to rally the party behind his so-called “byungjin” policy. On Saturday, Mr. Kim said that policy was not a temporary step but his party’s “permanent strategic line.” The byungjin — or “parallel advance” — policy calls for stockpiling nuclear weapons in the belief that the deterrent would allow the country to focus on economic recovery. Since taking power four years ago, Mr. Kim has adopted it as his national strategy, despite warnings from Washington and Seoul that it would further isolate his already heavily sanctioned country. North Korea makes few goods that the rest of the world wants, but it does specialize in exporting bombastic, bellicose pronouncements. Vice Marshal Ri’s comments were reported by the North’s state-run Pyongyang Radio and Korean Central Broadcasting Station, also a radio network. United States and South Korean officials doubted that North Korea has developed a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile that would deliver a nuclear payload to the continental United States. Its three tests of the intermediate-range ballistic missile Musudan, which is believed to have a range long enough to reach United States military bases in Guam, all failed last month, with the projectiles crashing to the sea or exploding shortly after liftoff, they said. But under Mr. Kim, North Korea has accelerated its nuclear and missile program. He presented his nuclear weapons program as his key achievement during the party congress, which served as a platform to cement his grip on power. “It is our unshakable determination that because the Workers’ Party has its byungjin line, there is nothing we cannot conquer in nuclear armament,” said another senior party official, Wang Chang-wuk, according to the North Korean radio reports. “We are determined to push through the party’s decision on building a nuclear might and to develop and make more diverse and advanced nuclear weapons of our own style.” On Saturday, a parade of top party officials spoke at the congress, idolizing Mr. Kim, who is believed to be in his early 30s, for “ushering in a great heyday in strengthening” North Korea, said the North’s official Korean Central News Agency. In his review of policies on Saturday, they said, Mr. Kim provided “an encyclopedic political program giving a perfect solution to all problems.” More than 3,400 delegates from across North Korea were attending the congress, the first since 1980, when Mr. Kim’s grandfather, the North’s founding President Kim Il-sung, was in charge. The congress will elect a new party leadership, reaffirming Mr. Kim at the top post, the North Korean media said.",2016-05-08T07:13:26.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Utilities have no choice but to build de facto permanent repositories near their plants, because after decades of searching for a centralized nuclear waste site, the United States is still at least 15 years away from a solution and has found nowhere else to store the roughly 30,000 tons that have already accumulated. In a little-noticed ruling in January, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, cleared the way for utilities to store radioactive wastes indefinitely at their nuclear power plants without holding formal public hearings or conducting any environmental assessment. Three weeks later, on Feb. 1, members of the Mescalero Apache tribe in New Mexico turned down a proposal to build a national high-level nuclear waste storage center on their reservation. Both supporters and critics of nuclear power agree that those two decisions mean that it is now much easier, and even necessary, for utilities to build their own storage sites for atomic wastes. Despite having spent nearly $2 billion studying a potential repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, the Department of Energy still does not know if the site is suitable; even if it is, the earliest that a permanent repository could open there would be in the year 2010. Here at the Palisades Nuclear Plant, an hour southwest of Grand Rapids, nine 16-foot-tall concrete and steel casks are being erected in a monument to one of the 20th century's enduring technical and political failures. The casks, each of which holds 30 tons of spent nuclear fuel and cost $500,000, stand side by side on a table-flat concrete pad a stone's throw from Lake Michigan. How long the casks and their contents will remain here is anybody's guess. This was never envisioned in the 1950's and early 60's, when the Government promoted the development of immense electric generating plants powered by atomic energy. Anticipating that the Government would either allow spent fuel to be recycled or would construct a permanent repository, utilities generally built small water pools to store their wastes temporarily. But the recycling idea was barred in the late 1970's by President Jimmy Carter, who feared it would produce huge quantities of plutonium capable of being used in nuclear bombs. And efforts over the last four decades to establish Government-owned permanent repositories in Kansas, Washington State, Texas and Nevada have failed. Now utilities that own the nation's 109 operating reactors and manage several others that have been closed are studying how to move spent nuclear fuel from bulging indoor storage pools to outdoor concrete casks. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has already received applications from utilities in Arkansas, California, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania for permission to build storage sites like this one, and more applications are expected, commission officials say. Palisades officials say they have no choice. Roughly 18 percent of the energy generated each year by the plant's owner, Consumers Power, a subsidiary of the CMS Energy Company, is produced by the Palisades reactor. Nationwide, about 21 percent of all electricity is generated by nuclear power. As long as the reactors operate they will produce high-level radioactive waste, adding to the 30,000 tons already accumulated since the 1960's, according to the Department of Energy. By the second decade of the 21st century there will be 55,000 more tons of spent nuclear fuel, department officials estimates. ""We're out of space in our pool, and we looked at several other options for storing wastes,"" said Mark Savage, the Palisades spokesman. ""Dry fuel storage in casks was the option we chose, and it's the safest and simplest component we have at this plant. There are no moving parts and nothing to break. It sits on a pad and releases heat."" The cask design chosen by Consumers Power is essentially a heavy steel barrel 1 inch thick inside a reinforced concrete shell that is 29 inches thick. During loading, the steel barrel is lowered into the storage pool, bundles of spent fuel rods are placed in the barrel, a thick top is welded in place and the entire assembly is then lifted out of the pool and slipped into the shell. The 130 tons of steel and concrete cannot contain all the radiation; a person hugging the cask for an hour would receive half the dose of a chest X-ray. Four other nuclear power plants in Maryland, South Carolina and Virginia already store their wastes above ground in casks. What distinguishes the Palisades project from the others is the relative ease with which Consumers Power established it. The other sites had all required extensive environmental evaluations and full public hearings. In 1982, as part of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, Congress foresaw the impending storage pool problem and encouraged utilities to build alternate nuclear waste sites. In 1990 the Bush Administration put the policy into effect by writing a rule that said the new storage sites could be built without formal public hearings or an environmental study, as long as utilities used casks that had been certified and approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Two years ago, immediately after the commission approved the Palisades cask design, a coalition of anti-nuclear groups and Frank J. Kelley, the Michigan Attorney General, sued the Government. Mr. Kelley argued that cask storage represented a potentially dangerous change in the nation's policy for managing atomic wastes that merited much more public involvement and debate. During oral arguments last October before the appeals court, Mr. Kelley produced a memorandum from Dr. Ross B. Landsman, an N.R.C. soils expert, warning Ivan Selin, the commission's chairman, that the Palisades waste site was situated amid unstable sand dunes, was within 150 yards of Lake Michigan and was vulnerable to earthquakes. He urged the agency to conduct a full environmental assessment to avoid what he said could be ""catastrophic consequences."" There have also been concerns about the casks themselves. Last summer Consumers Power announced that a review of X-rays had identified ""crack-like indications"" and several other flaws in the welds of the fourth cask, which was loaded in July. Kurt Haas, the director of plant safety and licensing, said in an interview that the flaws did not represent a threat to the structural integrity of the cask. Nevertheless, he said, the senior managers of Consumers Power decided that the cask must be unloaded and the weld repaired. Mr. Haas described the procedure as relatively straightforward. However, it would be the first time that a cask full of high-level radioactive wastes has been unloaded. According to an internal company memorandum obtained by Mary Sinclair, a 76-year-old longtime nuclear opponent from Midland, Mich., who is a plantiff in the suit decided by the appellate court, unloading the cask will be no simple feat. Mr. Haas said that the cracks do not present an emergency, and that the company is taking its time reviewing its procedures. But Mrs. Sinclair argues that the problem with cask No. 4 is an example of why the public should be more involved. She said questions about the safety of the casks and the procedures for opening them had been largely ignored by the Government and the utility. In court, the nuclear commission, with the help of the Justice Department and the utility industry, defended the Bush Administration's 1990 rule and the cask storage system. The Clinton Administration argued that the regulation limiting public hearings was lawful. On Jan. 11, a three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit unanimously ruled that the Government's action to encourage construction of above ground nuclear waste storage sites was valid and lawful. Mr. Kelley declined to be interviewed, saying through a spokesman that he had not decided whether to appeal the case to the Supreme Court. Mrs. Sinclair, the head of Don't Waste Michigan, an anti-nuclear organization, said her group would appeal to the nuclear commission to overturn the 1990 rule. ""The issue is whether the public has the right to be involved in how we are going to dispose of deadly poisons,"" Mrs. Sinclair said. ""It's incredible. The Government now has a procedure for building these waste sites in which they don't have to notify the public, local authorities or anything. They can just build them and load them.""",1995-02-15T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

MOSCOW — When the Soviet Union introduced its Alfa class submarine — at the time, the world’s fastest — the subs were the bane of American sailors. Now, the reactors that powered those submarines are being marketed as the next innovation in green power. Environmentalists say the technology is outdated and potentially dangerous, and marketing it as green energy is an abuse of nuclear power’s good green name. The Russians are not alone in pushing the idea that the next generation of nuclear reactors should have more in common with the small power plants on submarines than the sprawling installations of today. The kinds of marine reactors the Russians are promoting, though, also happen to create a byproduct — used fuel — that no one knows how to handle. Right now, that spent fuel is being stored at naval yards in the Russian Arctic. In most nuclear facilities, the used fuel, which is highly radioactive, is removed from the reactor and stored in a pool of water. But in the Soviet submarine model currently advanced by a Moscow company, the spent fuel ends up frozen along with the reactor and stored away. No engineering solution has been devised yet to decontaminate the fuel. In fact, the technology caused a number of mechanical accidents when it was used in Soviet submarines from the 1970s until the early 1990s. Kirill Danilenko, the director of the Russian company, Akme Engineering, said that the technology could be made safe, with no greater risk of meltdown than that at a larger nuclear plant. His vision is that small reactors will become so common that utilities can connect them and “build power plants like Lego sets.” The promise of miniature reactors powering homes, offices and schools is still years from being realized. The first Russian design, a pontoon-mounted reactor intended to be floated into harbors in energy-hungry developing countries, is already being built. But most promoters expect small reactors to come online at the end of this decade. The plans are going ahead in Russia and elsewhere in the face of criticism that a diffuse nuclear infrastructure — the idea that many midsize cities, for example, could have their own small reactor — is inherently risky. But once the science is perfected, such reactors are potentially far cheaper to build for every unit of electricity generated than traditional nuclear power plants. This is no small matter as capital expenses are the largest cost for nuclear power, making it more competitive with coal. Around the world, much of the nuclear industry is embracing the tried-and-true economics of serial production. In serial production, reactor cores, like Ford cars, would be rolled off an assembly line, then shipped to the site of a plant. They could be used separately or as modules for a more powerful generator. This would be possible, however, only if a reactor were small enough to fit on a railroad car. American companies are promoting nine designs for small reactors, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade group in Washington. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the Vienna group overseeing civilian nuclear power, has estimated global demand for small nuclear reactors could reach 500 to 1,000 reactors by 2040. The category is defined as reactors making less than 300 megawatts of electricity, or the amount needed to power 300,000 American homes. That is roughly a quarter of the energy output of big reactors. Small reactors have other advantages, too. They would fit the existing steam-generating equipment in old coal plants, for instance, making it easier to put nuclear facilities in current coal-burning energy plants. And small reactors have at least one nonproliferation benefit over their larger cousins: they can be loaded with fuel in the factory, reducing the need to ship fuel separately. Some models are tiny. One, for example, would be small enough to fit into a shipping container and would be trucked from site to site, like a diesel generator, except that it would need to be refueled only once every seven years or so. Proponents point out that Russian nuclear regulators and the United States Department of Energy have both endorsed small reactors. In America, companies with designs include Westinghouse, the maker of traditional reactors; Babcock & Wilcox, a maker of submarine reactors for the Navy; and NuScale, a start-up that spun out of an Oregon State University research project. The Russian company, Akme, is an acronym for atomic complex for small and medium energy and sometimes renders its name in English as Acme. Akme’s goal is to produce a prototype of a 100-megawatt nuclear reactor small enough to fit into a typical American backyard by 2019. The company was founded in December as a joint venture of Rosatom, the state nuclear power corporation, and a private electricity company owned by the Kremlin-connected oligarch Oleg V. Deripaska. It has $500 million in start-up capital. A minireactor will likely cost about $100 million. The design Akme chose is peculiar because it is cooled with a molten lead alloy, not water. In fact, the Soviet Union was the only nation to deploy liquid metal reactors at sea. Introduced in the 1970s, they packed enough power to propel submarines more than 45 miles per hour underwater. In fact, they were so powerful they compelled NATO to design an entirely new class of torpedo. But this cold war design is not without its drawbacks. The Bellona Foundation, a Norwegian environmental group and authority on nuclear waste in the Arctic, says the lead alloy coolant tended to freeze when the reactor had to be shut down in emergencies. That turned the reactor into an inaccessible block of lead, steel and waste. The group documented an accidental freezing of the core on one submarine, K-123, in the early 1980s after an emergency shutdown in the Kara Sea. The vessel limped back to base. The only way to repair it, though, was to remove the reactor segment, a job that took nine years. (The former Russian naval captain working for Bellona who revealed these and other details of reactor failures in a report in the 1990s was put on trial for revealing state secrets.) Today, hardened liquid-metal reactor cores litter the Arctic. While small, they still weigh hundreds of tons. No facility exists to melt out the lead alloy, which is itself lethally toxic, and extract the spent fuel rods. They remain an unsolved legacy of the Soviet submarine program; several are stored at a naval yard in Gremikha, on the Arctic Sea near Norway, according to Bellona. The product can hardly be called green, Igor Kudrik, a researcher at Bellona, said in a telephone interview. The Russian nuclear industry, in its eagerness to capitalize on the booming global demand for nuclear power, including new applications like small reactors, has dusted off unsafe designs, Mr. Kudrik said. “They haven’t come up with anything new,” he said. A spokeswoman for Akme said the company could not comment on military waste. Company officials said the commercial design would have to compete on safety, as well as economics, and that passive safety features would be built into the product. Anna Kudryavtseva, a vice president, said the nonmilitary version of the liquid-metal reactor would be “maximally safe even in not very capable hands.”",2010-03-19T03:12:58.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

Yesterday’s move is a setback for the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited , the 57-year-old government-owned corporation that has built all of Canada’s reactors and could soon be sold off to a private investor. The company is looking for the first sale of its untested Gen-III ACR-1000 reactor . Canadian nuclear industry watchers quoted in The Globe and Mail said that if the company couldn’t sell this new model in Canada, it had little chance of securing international deals. In the first open-bidding process of its kind in Canada, Ontario officials also considered applications from Westinghouse and Areva, the French nuclear giant . General Electric’s nuclear division didn’t bid because it is a longtime supplier of the company . To date, Areva is the only nuclear company to have sold a third-generation reactor, to the Finnish electric utility . As James Kanter of Green Inc. reported recently , that project has gone significantly over budget. Anti-nuclear environmental groups, meanwhile, endorsed Ontario’s move — and at least one group suggested that it represented a shift in energy policy, rather than a stroke of fiscal caution. In a statement, the Ontario Clean Air Alliance said the government’s actions “hint at a more enlightened approach to Ontario’s energy future –- one that favors plentiful green and clean alternatives over high-cost, high-risk nuclear power.”",2009-07-01T14:07:29.000+02:00,NYTIMES,science

""We are concerned about Indian Point 3's performance,"" said Curtis J. Cowgill, chief of the reactor projects branch, which oversees nuclear plants in the Northeast, known as Region I. The inspection team, led by Wayne Lanning, deputy director of the division of reactor safety, will evaluate operations, maintenance, engineering, safety assessment and quality-verification procedures during a two-week visit, Mr. Cowgill said. The inspection follows a report by the commission in November that criticized the operations, maintenance, procedures and some of the employees of Indian Point 3, which is owned and operated by the New York Power Authority, the country's largest non-Federal public power agency. Indian Point 2, owned by Consolidated Edison, was the subject of an augmented review in 1988 because of an improper water level in a steam generator, said Michael J. Spall, manager of nuclear information for the plant. Weak Management Control Cited The November report on the State Power Authority's Plant 3, part of a regular assessment of nuclear plants by the commission, said that performance had declined in five of seven categories. The decline was measured against an earlier review, known as the Systematic Assessment of Licensee Performance. These regular reports are issued every 18 months or so, and many of them have shown a declining trend in performance. The November report, Mr. Cowgill said, showed that ""performance at the plant was clearly not as good as it had been in the previous S.A.L.P.,"" and he added that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ""did not think the licensee had taken enough effective action to turn things around."" The integrated assessment, which begins tomorrow, will evaluate ""where they are today,"" Mr. Cowgill said. ""Management control"" is the major weakness at Indian Point 3, Mr. Cowgill said. ""We want the New York Power Authority to identify their problems and correct weaknesses on their own,"" he said. ""There have been too many cases where we have been involved too heavily."" The commission found numerous violations of Federal regulations in its November review, which assessed the plant's operations for the previous 15 months. Penalties for these violations amounted to $462,500 last year, the largest amount paid by any of the 31 nuclear plants in Region 1, said Diane Screnci, a spokeswoman for the Federal agency. One group of violations, first identified last May, led to ""conditions adverse to quality,"" including a poorly maintained system to add chemicals to the reactor water supplying a backup system to control the nuclear reaction, Ms. Screnci said. A separate violation led to a ""potential to overload"" a 480-volt emergency part of the electrical system, which Ms. Screnci said could ""prevent emergency generators from mitigating the consequences of an accident."" 'Inaccurate Information' Received Other fines were levied for ""deficiencies in the company's fitness-for-duty program,"" including one case in which an employee who tested positive for marijuana use was allowed to return to work. Other violations included ""inaccurate information provided"" during a regular inspection and a series of leaks in one of the water systems at the plant, which Ms. Screnci said, ""weren't evaluated and repaired in a timely fashion."" Indian Point 3 is one of two nuclear power plants adjacent to each other on the Hudson River. Indian Point 1 was built by Consolidated Edison 30 years ago under the first license granted by the Atomic Energy Commission for commercial production of nuclear power, the first reactor in what is now a nationwide network of 110 nuclear plants. Indian Point 1 was decommissioned 11 years later, but the building remains, its operations replaced by Indian Point 2 as newer technologies and safety features made the first plant obsolete. Today, the combined power of the two newer plants supplies New York City and most of Westchester with about 29 percent of their electricity. The Power Authority owns a second plant in Lycoming, N.Y., the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, which was fined $500,000 last year, with the penalties subsequently reduced to $300,000, Ms. Screnci said. The FitzPatrick plant is one of six plants in Region 1 on the agency's Watch List, a Federal designation for plants ""with declining performance over an extended period of time,"" Ms. Screnci said. Workers' Attitudes Criticized Mr. Cowgill and Ms. Screnci refused to speculate about whether the special team inspection of Indian Point 3 would cause it to be placed on the list. ""Anything is possible,"" Ms. Screnci said. ""There's no secret that the performance of Indian Point 3 is not what we would like it to be,"" said Carl F. Patrick, a spokesman for the New York Power Authority. Although the $ plant was ""extremely well run,"" in the past, Mr. Patrick said, ""Now, we're not running the plant as well as we'd like."" He attributed the problems to a lack of management oversight and the attitude of workers. Management control over the plant will be tightened, Ralph Beedle, executive vice president of the nuclear generation division of the New York Power Authority, said last week. ""We recognize the performance at Indian Point 3 is not what we want, and I expect to get that performance improved,"" Mr. Beedle said, adding, ""Is there an issue of management control? Yes."" Senior management at the plant has already been shifted, Mr. Beedle said, adding that weaknesses in the surveillance testing program, which oversees periodic maintenance needs, suggests that ""someone has not been paying attention to his job,"" Mr. Beedle said. Whether other managers are replaced ""has yet to be determined,"" he added. ""It may come to that."" A Highly Vocal Critic Mr. Patrick conceded that the management of the plant ""is not as good as it should be,"" but he said that the commission had not said the plant was unsafe. ""We meet all safety standards by wide margins, and our performance problems have not jeapardized safety,"" Mr. Patrick said. Both plants at Indian Point have had their share of problems and critics, none more vocal than Robert Pollard, a former regulatory agency safety inspector at Indian Point who quit his job in 1976, charging that Indian Point was ""an accident waiting to happen."" Mr. Pollard's action prompted the commission to conduct the longest series of hearings in its history to evaluate the safety of the plants and the adequacy of emergency plans in the region. Mr. Pollard now is a senior nuclear safety engineer for the Union of Concerned Scientists. Since that time, the need for power and the apparent lack of cost-effective alternatives ushered in a period of relative calm for the nuclear industry. In recent years, the industry has suffered a series of setbacks as costs and regulations have increased and cheaper, alternative energy sources have emerged. Since the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979, no new nuclear plants have been built in the United States, and existing plants, including the two at Indian Point, have been aging. Many continue to operate efficiently and their operators are planning to apply for 20-year licensing extensions when their initial 40-year licenses expire, but others have deteriorated and are being shut down. So far 15 nuclear plants have been closed earlier than planned. League of Women's Voters Meeting Last week, the League of Women Voters of Briafcliff-Ossining-Croton- Cortlandt, although not informed of the impending inspection by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, sponsored an informational meeting on the future of the two Indian Point plants. The theme of the discussion was ""Midlife Crisis at Indian Point? Time for Diversification or Divestment?"" The program attracted more than 150 people and a panel of nuclear critics, including Dr. Pollard, and nuclear proponents, including John C. Brons, president and chief operating officer of the New York Power Authority. Although the licenses of the two Indian Point plants won't expire until 2013 and 2015, respectively, nuclear experts say that plants age at different rates. They disagree about the amount of oversight necessary to monitor the aging process and about the consequences and costs of dismantling the giant reactors. Mr. Pollard, warning against efforts by the nuclear industry to relax existing regulations, called the aging plants ""hidden time bombs"" and urged the audience to lobby for ""upgrading not downgrading regulations."" Retiring those plants will be costly and difficult, Mr. Pollard said, adding that disposal problems appear unlikely to be resolved. Mr. Brons criticized regulations he said have not improved safety but have merely added to operating costs. ""We have regulations that impede safety,"" Mr. Brons said, including ""locked doors that prevent a person from moving through a plant expeditiously."" A national disposal site for nuclear waste can be found, Mr. Brons said, ""given the will."" Con Ed Declines Invitation Spokesmen for Consolidated Edison were also asked to the discussion but declined the invitation, saying that the utility ""doesn't participate in round tables or debates,"" which, they said, can be ""devisive and confusing."" Con Ed's Indian Point 2 received its latest assessment from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission last September, and Mr. Spall, the company spokesman, said that the evaluation gave the plant ratings ranging from good to superior in all seven categories. In 1991, however, workers at Indian Point 2 received the largest collective exposure to radiation of Westchester's two plants, Mr. Spall said. Last year, Mr. Spall added, the workers received their lowest collective dose. The reason, Ms. Screnci of the regulatory agency said, was that the plant operated almost continuously last year. When a nuclear plant shuts down for repairs, the workers usually receive greater exposure to radiation, partly because they go into areas they otherwise could not enter, she explained. Mr. Spall said the company is working to correct the higher exposure levels. Plant 2 is now closed for about 75 days. Maureen M. Morgan, a member of the board of the League of Women Voters and a newspaper columnist who has been monitoring operations at Indian Point, said, ""The question is not if we are going to retire these plants but when we will."" State officials must include a plan to retire its nuclear plants in its long-range energy plans, Ms. Morgan and others attending the meeting agreed. To deal with the inevitable closing of these plants on a case-by-case basis, Ms. Morgan said, constitutes ""crisis thinking."" Other speakers included Lindsay Audin, an energy manager at Columbia University and consultant for the state of Nevada on the proposed Yucca Mountain National Depository for High-Level Nuclear Waste, and William Rasin, vice president and director of the technical division of the Nuclear Management and Resources Council, the nuclear industry's major lobbying organization.",1993-03-07T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Hyman G. Rickover, who died July 8 at the age of 86, does not do justice to the man. As a former commanding officer of a nuclear-powered submarine, a former director of submarine warfare in the Navy Department and a former vice chief of naval operations, I had some 10 years of close association with Admiral Rickover. I had my share of fights with him. I also had many agreements. I had enormous respect and, indeed, considerable affection for the ''K.O.G.'' (kindly old gentleman), as he was known to us all. Admiral Rickover not only firmly established nuclear-power plants in Navy submarines and surface ships, he also forced standards of excellence in training, maintenance and operation of all types of conventional power plants and complex systems. He thoroughly indoctrinated all echelons of the Navy from lower pay grades of enlisted personnel to senior flag officers in what had to be done and how. His influence will be felt for centuries. Take a look at the leadership of the Navy today and over the last decade. Nuclear-trained people are at every level and will continue to be. True, it was time for Admiral Rickover to retire when he did, but his many extra years of active duty served the Navy in good stead. He was a tough taskmaster. However, his strengths far, far exceeded his faults, which were minute by comparison and frequently exaggerated. The influence of his standards in nuclear power spread throughout the Navy in virtually every area of engineering, technical progress and development. Had the civilian electric-power public-utility industry paid closer attention to the standards of design, construction, quality control, supervision, maintenance and training Admiral Rickover imposed on the Navy, we would be leading the world in industrial nuclear power plants today instead of bringing up a sorry fourth or fifth place. Admiral Rickover was a giant, and the United States Navy and indeed all of America are forever in his debt. HAROLD E.

Some readers may have inferred that the Union of Concerned Scientists supports shutdown of all operating nuclear reactors in this country. This is not, and never has been, our organization's view. Our position, supported by years of analysis, is that there are no insoluble technical obstacles to making nuclear-power plants adequately safe. The principal problems lie with the Federal Government's unwillingness to enforce its own regulations adequately and the industry's inability to exercise the kind of competent management necessary to insure safe operation of each and every plant in the United States. In addition, we believe that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees the nuclear industry, should solve a number of specific safety problems that increase the risk of serious accidents at plants in the United States. Unless these problems are solved, we see no alternative to a gradual phasing out of nuclear power in this country, once the plants now on line have exhausted their useful operating lives. Measures that could be instituted to rectify the situation include: * Establishment of clear deadlines by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for ''generic'' safety problems that the N.R.C. has identified as common among many plants, but solutions for which have been deferred for further study, so as not to impede the granting of operating licenses. * Modification of the two-step licensing process to create a combined construction-operating license. Approval of the license by the N.R.C. would be contingent on submission and thorough review of a complete, final design for a plant, free of generic defects. * Establishment of a public-hearing process to insure that any new plant has been built as designed, that its owner is capable of safe operation and that adequate emergency preparedness has been established in and around the plant. * Congress should establish an office of inspector general for the N.R.C. and an independent nuclear-safety board to investigate and fully disclose the causes and consequences of all accidents and near misses. * The Price-Anderson Act should be revised to insure that those responsible for nuclear accidents are held fully liable for damages to property and the public. Despite the differences in the level of safety achieved thus far at nuclear plants in the United States relative to that at Chernobyl, we believe that there is still a long way to go. The Soviet disaster at Chernobyl serves only to remind us that although the odds of a major accident at a reactor may not seem terribly great, such an accident is possible at United States plants and the consequences could be disastrous.

Lewis's Oct. 4 letter refers to nuclear power plants as environmentally benign. Barring accidents, they may be, but no permanent storage site has been chosen for the radioactive wastes produced by these plants. These wastes, which are accumulating in inadequate temporary storage facilities, are certainly not environmentally benign. And I suspect no ''permanent'' storage facility will safely contain the wastes for the tens of thousands of years they will remain radioactive. The clean-energy alternatives to burning fossil fuels (solar, wind and water power) are available, and they would be more in use if funding for research had been shunted in their direction rather than devoted to research into nuclear-power generation.

THE Millstone 3 nuclear power plant, where as of Wednesday six plant operators had failed a new safety examination being given by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is not the only plant plagued by such failures, critics of training in the nuclear power industry say. About 25 percent of nuclear plant operators in the country failed the new tests, Kenneth Bossong, director of the Critical Mass Energy Project, an anti-nuclear arm of the Ralph Nader group, Public Citizen, said last week. Mr. Bossong asserted that the failures support the group's contention that the operators are not well educated and are trained in programs that are not regulated by the commission. Two-thirds of the nuclear plant operators in the United States do not have college degrees, and many have only a high school diploma, Mr. Bossong said. Mr. Bossong, whose group is suing the commission to force it to implement reviews of the training program, said the training programs are reviewed and approved only by the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, a trade group. ''It's a formula for disaster,'' Mr. Bossong said. ''The public perception is of white-coated physicists running these plants, but that's limited to the movies.'' Louis J. Keezing, a spokesman for Northeast Utilities, which owns the Millstone complex in Waterford, said Government educational and training requirements were not necessary. ''If you look at the record of our nuclear training programs themselves, you'll see they're the most comprehensive industrial training programs ever developed,'' Mr. Keezing said. ''And to say it takes a college education is just not true.'' Most operators, he said, have put in several years aboard nuclear-powered Navy vessels, and have come up through the plant learning each system. ''More important than having a piece of paper is having that experience,'' he said. But, he said, Northeast Utilities has a voluntary program with Thames Valley State Technical College for plant operators to earn associate's degrees in nuclear plant operations. Since the program was started in 1983, 78 people have graduated. Mr. Keezing blamed the failure of the six operators at Millstone 3 on the company's written emergency procedures that allow operators to use their own judgment. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires strict outlines of the sequence to follow in an emergency. Though the operators were able to control simulated emergencies, they could not do it in the time or manner required by the commission. Local officials reacted with consternation to the news that 6 of 12 operators at the Millstone 3 plant failed the tests. ''They have to come up to the standards, and that's it. That's the way it has to be,'' said Lawrence J. Bettencourt, First Selectman of Waterford, where the Millstone reactor complex is located. ''I deal with the N.R.C. all the time on drills, and I don't always agree with them,'' Mr. Bettencourt said. ''But whether you like the procedures or not, you follow them.'' Failure Rate C. Francis Driscoll, the City Manager in New London, said: ''You have to have trained operators for water systems and sewer systems so you don't muck up the environment. Problems at a nuclear plant, which can be far more dangerous than a sewage spill, have to be dealt with quickly.'' Mr. Bossong said the nuclear power industry's statements about the strength of its testing programs were belied by the failure rate at Millstone 3 and other plants in Florida and New York, where as many as half the operators flunked commission tests. Moreover, though the operators are supposed to be reviewed every two years, Mr. Bossong said his group found instances of plants going as long as six years between reviews. The testing at Millstone 3 last week was the first since the plant opened in 1986. There are 55 people licensed to operate the Millstone 3 plant, said Anthony Castagno, a spokesman for Northeast Utilities. The testing of the operators is continuing. After last week's failures, Northeast Utilities announced it was revising its nuclear plant training procedures and instituting other changes. All operators who failed the test have been removed from duty, and an additional management employee licensed to operate the plant will be in the control room at all times, Mr. Keezing said. The company has been scrambling to revise the training of all crews, especially those about to be tested. Operators at the company's Connecticut Yankee plant in Haddam already passed similar tests this year. Operators at the two other plants in Waterford, Millstone 1 and 2, are scheduled to undergo tests later this year.",1989-10-01T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council concluded a two-day summit meeting in Riyadh on Sunday, agreeing to study how to proceed with development of such capacity. At the same time, they called for a peaceful settlement of the crisis over Iran's nuclear program, which the United States and some other Western nations say is for nuclear arms. ''The states of the region have a right to possess nuclear energy technology for peaceful purposes,'' the summit meeting's closing communiqué said, echoing Iran's insistence that it, too, had the right to peaceful nuclear technology. Publicly, officials of the gulf council said the development of a nuclear energy program would help meet their rising demand for electricity, despite the huge oil reserves. ''Nuclear technology is an important technology to have for generating power, and the gulf states will need it equally,'' said Prince Saud al-Faisal, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, speaking to reporters. ''It is not a threat,'' he said. ''It is an announcement so that there will be no misinterpretation for what we are doing.'' But analysts and officials said the announcement had a different purpose -- to warn the United States not to acquiesce to Iran's nuclear ambitions as pressure grows on the Bush administration to reach out to Iran for help in stabilizing Iraq. A report released by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group last week recommended that the United States open negotiations with Iran. The predominantly Sunni Arab states fear that the United States may abandon Arab concerns to gain assistance from Iran, which could confirm Iran as the regional hegemon. ''The message is that the gulf countries will develop their own nuclear program if Iran is rewarded with the terms of the Baker-Hamilton report,'' said Abdelaziz O. Sager, chairman of the Gulf Research Center in Dubai, who is familiar with the nuclear initiative. ''They are trying to say that if the Iranian program continues, you will force us to become nuclear capable too.'' At a Persian Gulf security conference in Bahrain on Saturday, Iran's foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, insisted that Iran was seeking only peaceful nuclear capacity. ''The time of nuclear weapons is over,'' Mr. Mottaki said. He added that if nuclear weapons served as an effective deterrent, they should have stopped the fall of the Soviet Union and Israel would not have had to go to war in Lebanon against Hezbollah this past summer. Saudi officials have warned that a nuclear Iran could cause a regional arms race, suggesting that Saudi Arabia would be forced to acquire nuclear technology, too. King Abdullah said Saturday that the region was increasingly becoming ''a powder keg ready to explode,'' citing conflict in Iraq, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories, as well as the continuing Iranian nuclear crisis. At least six Arab countries have reportedly sought to develop nuclear power programs, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Morocco and Algeria.",2006-12-11T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,washington

You cite ""tools and gloves used near nuclear reactors."" In fact, highly radioactive reactor components -- filters and pipes, for example -- would go to the proposed dump. You also state that waste from retired nuclear power plants ""will have to meet the criteria for low-level waste."" But nuclear wastes are not classified by level of radioactivity. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission puts all radioactive waste generated by a nuclear power plant into the catch-all ""low-level"" category except for the spent fuel rods, which are classed as ""high-level."" The distinction is blurred by the fact that some of the long-lived fission products in the ""high-level"" fuel rods leak out into the surrounding water and become part of the wastes that are classified as ""low level."" These highly radioactive reactor components should be excluded from the ""low-level"" waste category. Efforts to site ""low-level"" waste dumps are going forward though the Environmental Protection Agency has not yet finished formulating standards to protect public health and the environment in areas surrounding such sites. Particularly since scientists are concerned about the danger of migration of radionuclides from Ward Valley into water supplies, it would be foolish to open the dump in the absence of E.P.A. standards.

The release came just hours before the beginning of an elaborate 80th birthday celebration for North Korea's hard-line Communist leader, Kim Il Sung. It included what appeared to be the first detailed images ever seen of the inside as well as the outside of some of the plants that have prompted a growing confrontation between North Korea and the United States. But the tape left unresolved many questions about the true nature of the nuclear plants. Moreover, it appeared to omit a critical section: A suspected plutonium reprocessor that has been at the center of a growing argument in Washington over how close North Korea has come to producing crude atomic weapons. Satellite Photos of Area Until today Western intelligence analysts were relying almost entirely on satellite photographs of the sprawling plant at Yongbyon, just north of the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. But no sooner was the tape broadcast in Japan today than analysts in Tokyo, Seoul and Washington were dissecting it for any hints about the state of North Korea's nuclear skills. ""It is a very positive sign,"" said Leonard Spector of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which is conducting a study of nuclear issues on the Korean Peninsula. ""It looks like we are finally getting some real transparency about their nuclear projects. But the big outstanding question is the reprocessing plant."" Last week, after a six-year delay, North Korea's Parliament voted to ratify an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to allow inspection of its nuclear facilities. It now has 90 days to actually let inspectors in. But first it must submit a list of its installations, and there are still widespread suspicions that, like Iraq, North Korea may attempt to hide some of its capability. No Big Power Lines American officials maintain that the Yongbyon installation is far too big to be a power plant, and say that its real mission is to produce weapons-grade plutonium. Moreover, satellite photographs do not show large power lines at the plant, casting doubt on North Korea's contention that the plants are solely for power generation. At a briefing on Tuesday for Japanese reporters visiting Pyongyang for Mr. Kim's birthday celebrations, a spokesman for the North Korean Atomic Energy Ministry, Choe Chong Sun, said the list would include three reactors at Yongbyon, only one of which is now operational. But according to news reports here, he denied the existence of any reprocessing plant, which actually converts nuclear waste into plutonium. Mr. Choe did say for the first time, however, that North Korea is studying the nuclear reprocessing cycle -- in which spent uranium is processed into plutonium and sent back to the power plants. Japan has such a project under way now for its nuclear power plants, and North Korea has used cited this fact to justify its own program. By most accounts, North Korea's reprocessing plant is still not in operation. But Robert Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, said last week that ""once they have the requisite plutonium, they can have a weapon in as little as a few months to a two years."" Others dispute that view, saying that North Korea is farther behind than most nations think, and that it is using the issue as a bargaining chip.",1992-04-16T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

Gates and wire fences are up. Archaeologists are sifting through dirt to document stony dwellings dating from 100 B.C. A technical school is welcoming apprentices eager to learn how to maneuver in high-tech control rooms and operate water-cooling systems. The activity is all tied to a plan by Horizon Nuclear Power to turn this rugged outpost into the home of a plant that could be critical not just to the company, but to the Welsh economy and Britain’s energy future. Horizon, a subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi, is in private talks with the British government over how and when it might build a nuclear plant here at the northern tip of Wales. If the parties reach a deal on how the project’s estimated 15 billion pound ($18.95 billion) cost will be paid, this stronghold of Welsh culture will change in ways that residents are just starting to consider. Some people worry about nonstop truck traffic, the blasting of rock and soil, and the waves of outsiders the plant would bring to live and work in the area. Others in northern Wales herald the economic benefit the potentially enormous investment could have. They see the Horizon plant, which is expected to produce enough electricity for 5.5 million homes, as a vehicle for rebirth. The British government, eager for reliable, low-carbon energy to replace aging coal plants and nuclear reactors, has been encouraging. Greg Clark, the business and energy minister, told Parliament in June that the new Wales plant , Wylfa Newydd, was “next” in Britain’s nuclear “pipeline” and that the government would consider making a “direct investment” in it with Japanese government agencies. But Horizon and Hitachi executives are frustrated with the pace of the talks. In an interview, Duncan Hawthorne, Horizon’s chief executive, said Hitachi had spent “billions” of pounds on the project, including the cost of acquiring it from two German utilities in 2012. “It is a very long and expensive road here,” he said, adding that “the next several months will be critical.” Hitachi, without providing exact figures, wants government financing from Britain and Japan to help attract outside investors like pension funds that seek long-term income streams. Investments by the governments would also help lower Horizon’s risk rating. The Wylfa Newydd plant, with two giant reactors, would be just the second nuclear plant to be built in the United Kingdom since the 1990s. Once a world leader, Britain’s nuclear industry atrophied after serious accidents in Ukraine and the United States spurred broad resistance to nuclear power. Britain has legally committed to cutting carbon emissions. As a result, the government is reassessing its energy options amid a decline in natural gas from the North Sea oil fields and a decision to phase out the use of coal. Proponents of wind and solar energy say Britain should be putting its money there, but those sources have not been able to match the steady supply of power nuclear energy produces. So nuclear plants are back in vogue. One is being built at Hinkley Point in southwest England, and at least four more are planned. “It’s hard to conceive that nuclear does not have an important role to play,” said Steve Holliday, a former chief executive of National Grid, the British power system operator. Britain’s renewed interest in nuclear power stands out among Western countries, where such plants have become forbiddingly costly and complex. The challenges were evident in October when Toshiba scrapped plans to build a plant in northern England. Delays and cost overruns at plants being built at Olkiluoto, Finland, and Flamanville, France, have hurt the industry’s reputation elsewhere in Europe. Germany, the region’s top manufacturing power, is phasing out nuclear power. An abundance of cheap shale gas has undercut interest in the United States, although two new plants are in the works. Hitachi is intent on the plant in Wales, Mr. Hawthorne said, because it would provide a key European foothold after the 2011 Fukushima accident dampened interest in Japan. Horizon executives have described the area as an ideal location, with water from the sea to be used in the cooling system and the rocky terrain able to bear the massive concrete structure that nuclear power demands. For Anglesey Island, with a population of about 70,000, the project would provide a huge lift and create around 850 permanent jobs. Many local residents favor it because a smaller nuclear facility on a nearby seaside bluff was a dependable employer for nearly 50 years before closing in 2015. Gareth Winston Roberts, a local councilor who worked at the plant — known as Wylfa, after the bluff — before retiring in the 1990s, called it “a godsend.” “It kept people here,” he said. “It produced a lot of engineers.” Gwen Parry-Jones worked there beginning in 1989. Since April, she has been Horizon’s executive director and is steering the negotiations with the government. For the previous decade, she was an executive at EDF Energy, a French-owned utility that has taken over much of Britain’s nuclear system. “I benefited from having a nuclear power station effectively on my doorstep as a young scientist,” she said. “I strongly feel that we are benefiting from the fact that there is an existing nuclear power station here.” The need for jobs is obvious. The Wylfa plant still employs some technicians to remove fuel rods, but a local chemical plant closed in 2004 and an aluminum smelter closed in 2009. Britain’s plan to leave the European Union this year could hurt another key employer, the port at Holyhead, a hub for trade with Ireland, an E.U. member. “We find ourselves in a position where we need that one big project,” said Edward T. Jones, a local cattle farmer who also lectures on economics at Bangor Business School in North Wales. Some local leaders also see the plant as a vehicle for preserving the island’s character. “We still have got the Welsh language, and it’s quite a strong part of our community,” said Llinos Medi, the leader of the island’s governing council. “With work we can keep our young people and our culture and our Welsh language.” But some residents believe the plant could damage the island’s rural charm and hurt tourism. A walk along the pebble beach at Cemlyn Bay, a wildlife sanctuary next to the construction site, suggests why. The old Wylfa plant sits at the beach’s eastern end. Because the new one will be far larger, much of the surrounding landscape must be reshaped to accommodate it. The North Wales Wildlife Trust has been asking that fragile wildlife populations — thousands of terns nest here every summer — be taken into consideration. “It is going to completely spoil the area,” said Simon Walker, a retired businessman who was on the shore with his wife, Susan, watching his four dogs splash in the water. Last month, in a nod to environmental concerns, the Welsh government said it would review the site preparations. Horizon said it disagreed with the move, which could result in delays. Whether the plant proceeds will probably come down to how it will be paid for. A key yardstick is the Hinkley Point facility in southwest England. The government is financing that plant’s £20 billion cost through a so-called contract for difference, an arrangement that guarantees developers of big energy projects a long-term base rate for the power they produce. If the price of electricity falls below that rate, customers pay higher bills to make up the difference. At Hinkley Point, the British government guaranteed the owners an inflation-indexed price of £92.50 per megawatt-hour for 35 years. That is about 50 percent higher than current energy rates. Not surprisingly, the government has been criticized for potentially saddling consumers with expensive electricity for decades. With Horizon, the British government is pushing for a rate up to 30 percent lower than what it agreed to for Hinkley Point. Mr. Hawthorne of Horizon said he anticipated the Wales plant could provide power at “a significant price reduction” compared with Hinkley Point. The question is whether a British government consumed with the process of leaving the European Union is prepared to move quickly on the Anglesey Island project — and how pivotal it believes the plant is to its climate change promises.",2019-01-07T18:23:50.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

Credit... Sergei Ilnitsky/EPA, via Shutterstock Russian soldiers who control a giant nuclear power plant in Ukraine are detaining workers and subjecting them to brutal interrogations in a search for possible saboteurs, prompting many employees to leave and raising concerns about safety, Ukrainian officials said. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant — Europe’s largest — lies in southern Ukraine in the city of Enerhodar on the eastern side of the Dnipro River, across from territory still held by Ukrainian forces. With 11,000 workers, the plant occupies a strategically important spot, and safety concerns at the plant make any Ukrainian counteroffensive to retake the area particularly complicated. Russian forces have fortified the outside of the plant with trenches and heavy artillery, and inside they are stepping up measures to find anyone they think might pose a threat, according to local and company officials. Enerhodar’s exiled mayor, Dmytro Orlov, says he has received reports from employees and residents that workers at the plant are regularly abducted by Russian soldiers, “thrown into basements” and interrogated about suspected insurgent activity. Speaking on a Radio Svoboda program called “Azov News,” he said people who had remained in the city to safely operate the plant and avoid accidents were working “under moral and physical pressure.” He could not immediately be reached for comment. Many plant employees and other residents are trying to escape to Ukrainian-held territory, he said. “Even young people are leaving the city,” he said. “It is unclear who will operate the nuclear power plant.” Mr. Orlov’s statements could not be independently confirmed. The state company that oversees the complex, Energoatom, has offered similar accounts based on interviews with workers at the plant. Petro Kotin, the acting president of Energoatom, told reporters last month that the Russians were using the nuclear power plant as a military base. “Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is a well-fortified facility even in peacetime,” he said. “It is a perfect military base. Moreover, the Russians understand that the amount of nuclear material that is located there protects them. Ukraine will not strike at such an object.” Enerhodar, like other the Russia-occupied areas in the south, has been the scene of attacks by Ukrainian partisans and reprisals by Russian forces. Moscow has cracked down in the face of a growing resistance movement in southern Ukraine, including violence, civil disobedience and efforts to help the Ukrainian military. Tensions in the city escalated on May 22, when Andrii Shevchyk, whom the Russians had installed as mayor, was injured in a bombing outside his apartment. He had to be airlifted to Crimea for medical treatment. The next day, according to Energoatom, an employee of the nuclear power plant was shot multiple times at his home by Russian forces. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian proxy on the main governing council for the Zaporizka region, which includes the nuclear plant, said in television interview on Tuesday that it was time to institute the death penalty for “war criminals.” . Ivan Federov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol who has become something of an unofficial spokesman for Ukrainian resistance in the region, estimated on Tuesday that about 500 locals in his home city alone had been detained and held by Russian forces. His claim could not be independently verified, as Russia tightly controls access to occupied territories. People living there regularly have their cellphones inspected by Russian forces at checkpoints and during searches of their homes, according to witnesses, making communication with outsiders exceedingly risky. Mr. Federov was himself kidnapped by Russian forces before being released, part of a pattern that has played out in towns and villages including Enerhodar. Ivan Samoidyuk. the first deputy Mayor of Enerhodar, has now been in Russian custody for more than three months, according to Ukrainian officials. As Russia steps up its repression, the Ukrainian government has promised a large counteroffensive and has told everyone who can flee occupied territories to leave before it begins.",2022-06-23T07:32:31.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

The plan, which is being prepared with advice from officials at the International Atomic Energy Agency here, would provide for refitting of some reactors with more modern safety features, the closing down of those considered too unsafe to be worth saving and the provision of alternative sources of electricity, including supplies from Western Europe, according to diplomats and agency officials here. Billions to Prevent Catastrophe Estimates of the cost of such a program, which is designed to prevent another nuclear catastrophe like the one in Chernobyl, vary from $10 billion to $20 billion. The idea is to find this money over several years from a number of sources, including direct government grants, guaranteed government loans and loans from such development institutions as the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Community's European Investment Bank. Germany's Environment Minister, Klaus Topfer, said last month that the cost of such an assistance program would be around $9 billion. The United States has told the International Atomic Energy Agency that it might cost between $11 billion and $20 billion. ""At present it looks 90 percent certain the Munich summit will back the program and we hope this agency will provide its secretariat in partnership with the Brussels Commission of the European Community,"" said Morris Rosen, Assistant Deputy Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency and head of its Nuclear Safety Division. Concern Over Safety The so-called Group of Seven countries -- which, besides the United States, includes Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- first expressed concern about the safety of nuclear reactors in East Europe and the Soviet Union at their 1989 Paris meeting, three years after the Cher nobyl disaster. Last year, at their London meeting, they urged Western countries to help raise safety standards in the former Communist world. After the appeal at the London meeting, the so-called Group of 24, a body set up by all Western industrialized countries to coordinate aid to the former Communist world, created a special working group to examine the nuclear safety problem in cooperation with the Brussels Commission of the European Community. But while this led to several Western governments offering help to Eastern countries to make their reactors safer, officials at the atomic energy agency said the aid is uncoordinated, duplicative and far less effective than the program they expect to be approved at the Munich meeting. Companies Need Orders Just how specific a commitment the Group of Seven countries will give to make the East's nuclear power industry safer still remains uncertain. [ In Washington, a Congressional expert on nuclear energy voiced support for such a plan. Representative Norman D. Dicks, Democrat of Washington and a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said he believed the Bush Administration should do more ""to work with the Soviets regarding their unsafe reactors."" [ ""This is more serious than dismantling nuclear weapons,"" Representative Dicks said. ""We can get a lot of support for this in the Congress."" ] Officials of the atomic energy agency said such a program for the former Communist world's nuclear power industry would also be attractive for American and European nuclear companies, which are starved for new orders because of environmental opposition to nuclear power and the fact that the low price of oil and gas currently makes nuclear-generated electricity relatively expensive. France, which has invested more heavily in nuclear power than other industrialized countries, is especially anxious for contracts to upgrade East Europe's reactors. But Germany's nuclear industry has been hit as well by that country's ecological movement. Speaking in Budapest last month, the head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Jacques Attali, said the international community should ""mobilize itself in order not only to finance the closing of the most dangerous nuclear power plants, but also to bring together the human and technological resources needed to rehabilitate that portion of the stock of nuclear power plants which can be brought up to a satisfactory safety level."" He said the bank would be ready to take part in lending operations up to some $4 billion for this purpose. Germany and France are leading the drive for such a campaign, warning that another nuclear disaster like one at Chernobyl would deal a devastating blow to public confidence in nuclear power around the world and further cripple the West's nuclear industry. ""We must protect Western nuclear investment by making sure there is no catastrophic accident in the East,"" Mr. Topfer, the German Environment Minister, told the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum in Yokohama in April. Safety Standards Urged Germany is also pushing for a new international convention that would set obligatory reactor safety standards replacing existing national norms. Experts said the German plan would effectively close most, if not all, existing Soviet-designed power reactors. But the experts said that shutting down the former Communist world's Soviet-designed power reactors temporarily to make them safer or closing these plants altogether will be difficult to organize because these countries are heavily dependent on nuclear-generated electricity. Hungary gets 50 percent of its power from nuclear reactors while Bulgaria gets 35.7 percent, Czechoslovakia 28.4 percent and the territories of the former Soviet Union 12.2 percent. Reactors that cannot be made substantially safer are likely to be replaced with other fossil fuel power plants, which are far cheaper to build. But Czechoslovakia has already said it wants to replace its Soviet reactors with safer Western ones if it can find the money because it does not wish to increase pollution by burning more of its own brown coal. The officials of the Group of Seven countries who prepare the annual economic summit meetings have created a special subcommittee to draft a declaration on nuclear safety in the East. It met in Cologne earlier this week. 16 Chernobyl Reactors The territories of the former Soviet Union have 16 large graphite reactors of the kind that exploded at Chernobyl. The atomic energy agency considers the safety of these reactors ""a matter of great international concern."" Reactors of the type used at Chernobyl currently provide 47.8 percent of the nuclear-generated electricity in the countries of the former Soviet Union. The continuing deficiences of these reactors were highlighted a few weeks ago when a reactor of this type near the major Russian city of St. Petersburg sprang a leak that resulted in a small quantity of radioactive material escaping into the atmosphere. Soviet-designed reactors of all types make up 11 percent of the world's operating reactors and 32 percent of those currently under construction, according to a new study by the atomic energy agency. Of the pressurized water reactors, which are known as W.W.E.R.'s and are the only type to have been exported by the Soviet Union, there are a total of 41 in operation and 31 more under construction. All of the W.W.E.R. reactors, the agency said, ""lack important safety features which are basic to similar pressurized water reactors in the West."" Their weaknesses include lack of a containment system to prevent accidental radioactive emissions from leaking into the atmosphere as well as deficient controls and insufficient fire protection. 10 Still in Operation The least safe reactors, in the atomic energy agency's view, are the first generation pressurized water reactors known as W.W.E.R.-230's. Ten of these early reactors are still in operation. Four of them are in Russia, two near the Finnish border, four more are in Bulgaria and two are in Czechoslovakia. The former East Germany had four of these reactors, but after reunification the Bonn Government ordered them permanently closed for safety reasons, replacing the lost power without difficulty from plants in the western half of Germany. Armenia also closed its reactors of this type when it became independent, citing safety considerations and saying they had also been built in a region where earthquakes occur. Last year the agency recommended that Bulgaria permanently close its four W.W.E.R.-230's. But the Sofia Government refused, saying it could not accept the electricity shortages this would create. But it has agreed to shut down two of them temporarily while new safety features are installed. In its new report, the atomic agency reckons that the 10 functioning W.W.E.R.-230's together have about 50 serious safety faults, which would cost some $200 million to $400 million per reactor to rectify. They also have 50 other less serious safety defects, which would cost an additional $50 million per reactor to resolve. A later generation of the same reactor, called the W.W.E.R.-213, is considered safer but still needs more modern instruments and other improvements, the agency said. Finland, which has two, has already made these changes, introducing German technology. But Russia, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, with a total of 14 among them, have not yet done so. Two reactors of this type are also under construction in Cuba. A 1,000-megawatt version of the W.W.E.R. is considered by the agency to incorporate relatively good safety features, which would probably contain any radioactive leak. But this reactor's operating controls are said to be old-fashioned. Bulgaria is the only country outside the former Soviet Union to have a reactor of this type.",1992-05-21T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,front-page

The reactor at the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant, in Kagoshima prefecture, is the first to return to service since government regulators introduced upgraded safety standards in 2013. Most of Japan’s 48 operable commercial nuclear reactors were shut down soon after the Fukushima accident, and none have operated since 2013. The issue of whether Japan should again join the ranks of nations that use nuclear power is a highly contentious one here. The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe supports restarting idled reactors that meet the new enhanced safety standards, arguing that Japan’s economy depends on the low-cost power they provide. Japan has few domestic energy sources, and the country imports virtually all the fossil fuels it uses to power its cars, homes and factories. Electricity prices in Japan have increased by 20 percent or more since the Fukushima disaster, squeezing households and businesses. The public remains skeptical about the plants’ safety, however, with surveys showing a majority favor closing the idled plants permanently. Plans to restart Sendai and other reactors have been in place since the new safety regulations were introduced more than two years ago, but they have been slowed by political and technical obstacles. The plants need to be retrofitted with new ventilation systems and other protections, and the operators require the approval of local political leaders to switch them back on. The Sendai plant was declared safe by regulators nearly a year ago, in September 2014. The utility that owns the plant, Kyushu Electric Power, said it removed control rods from the core of the reactor at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, initiating the atomic reaction that will eventually produce electricity. It plans to start producing and transmitting electricity for its customers next month. The national broadcaster NHK aired video of workers in the plant’s control room as they restarted the reactor. Tomomitsu Sakata, a spokesman for Kyushu Electric Power, said the reactor had been put back online without any problems. Dozens of protesters, including a former prime minister, gathered outside the plant as the police stood guard.",2015-08-11T08:04:28.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific
1a063ac8-5987-4fa8-8712-44b29fd572d9,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/09/us/nuclear-arsenals-appear-to-spread-to-other-nations.html,NUCLEAR ARSENALS APPEAR TO SPREAD TO OTHER NATIONS,"While the superpowers negotiate possible cuts in nuclear weapons, some nations are expanding their nuclear arsenals and others are joining the ranks of those possessing or able to build such arms. The extent of the nuclear spread is suggested by the growing probability that Israel is a nuclear power, by the ability of India and Pakistan to produce weapons if they choose and by the French and British arsenals. Peter Clawson of the Union of Concerned Scientists in Cambridge, Mass., said in an interview that Soviet-American arms reductions might draw China, France and Britain into cuts, and Soviet-American restraints on nuclear testing could lend credibility to calls for smaller nations not to test. But he added that it was not clear if Pakistan, India or Israel could be dissuaded. '68 Treaty on Nuclear Spread In theory, any country with an uncontrolled civilian nuclear power program can divert nuclear materials from peaceful use to weapons. In the 1960's, in an effort to curb the spread of weapons beyond the nations that already had them, the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain completed a treaty on nonproliferation. The treaty, signed in 1968 and in force since 1970, has been joined by more than 120 non-nuclear-weapon countries, which pledge themselves not to divert nuclear materials to arms. Of the declared nuclear-weapon countries, the treaty was not signed by France and China, and other nonsigners have since shown interest in retaining freedom of action even if they may not have actually developed nuclear weapons. In the view of arms-control experts, Soviet-American reductions in nuclear arms may outweigh worry over smaller countries' arming themselves. But the experts say even an accord between the Soviet Union and the United States would leave a nuclear threat hanging over the world. Israel, according to an article in The Sunday Times of London that is given credence by nuclear experts, may have a larger nuclear stockpile than previously suspected. Pakistan and India are thought capable of assembling nuclear weapons on short notice. It is not known whether South Africa has the bomb, although there are reasons to believe it may have. All four countries have been described as ''suspected nuclear weapon nations'' by the Nuclear Control Institute of Washington, a group studying the spread of nuclear weapons. According to the institute, several other ''threshold'' countries are believed to have the capacity for making weapons, though not necessarily the intent. Those that have shown intent are called by the institute the ''problem'' nations. They include Argentina, Brazil and North Korea, and are believed to have taken steps in their reactor programs that could point to eventual production of weapons. Libya Has Sought Technology Other so-called problem nations, such as Libya, have sought nuclear technology but without much success, and Israel bombed an Iraqi reactor in 1981 on the premise that it could be used to produce weapons. China, a nuclear power since 1964, reversed its policy in the 1980's and now opposes the spread of nuclear weapons. Its relatively modest arsenal has not been growing swiftly, but its weapons have been improved, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. China is believed to have shared nuclear technology, weapon design information and nuclear materials with others. Leonard S. Spector of the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, who is about to publish his third annual survey on the spread of nuclear weapons, said trends were discouraging. He said that there was the likelihood of a nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan and that the apparent ability of Israel to expand its stockpile contained important lessons. 'A Sense of Complacency' ''We have had a sense of complacency,'' Mr. Spector said, because no potentially nuclear country has tested a device since India did in 1974. But recent revelations, he said, show that ''America's ability to keep a lid on proliferation has really taken a nosedive.'' Not all analysts are so pessimistic. ''I have not seen any radical change,'' said Warren H. Donnelly of the Library of Congress. ''Everybody seems to be inching along. There has been no sudden, unsuspected breakthrough or acceleration.'' He said India-Pakistan tensions might be exaggerated, and the United States was exerting pressure on Pakistan not to upset the balance. On Oct. 27, the Reagan Administration certified to Congress, as a condition of continuing military aid, that Pakistan did not have a nuclear weapon and that arms sales would ''reduce significantly the risk'' of Pakistan's crossing the nuclear threshold. Problems of Making the Bomb According to Mr. Spector of the Carnegie Endowment, the most difficult step in making weapons-grade material is enriching the natural uranium, which is largely nonfissionable uranium-238, with only seven-tenths of 1 percent fissionable uranium-235, to 3 percent to 5 percent uranium-235. Raising the concentration to the required 90 percent takes fewer steps, Mr. Spector said. The Washington Post, citing intelligence reports, said Pakistan had achieved 93.5 percent enrichment. The paper did not say how much weapons-grade material was now in hand. If India were to believe that Pakistan had the bomb, analysts say, it would be encouraged to pursue its own program. India, with several nuclear power plants, some operating outside of safeguards by which the International Atomic Energy Agency monitors the uses of nuclear materials, is already able to produce plutonium for potential use in nuclear weapons. The Role of Plutonium The fissionable plutonium-239 isotope is a byproduct of power reactors and, when separated from the depleted uranium fuel, can be used as material for reactor fuel or for nuclear weapons. India's plutonium reprocessing capacity is expected to grow by the early 1990's to allow as many as 60 bombs per year to be assembled, according to a Library of Congress study. Mr. Spector says that the creeping growth in nuclear ability, even without weapon tests, is insidious. In last year's Carnegie Endowment survey, he wrote, ''For the past 20 years the spread of the bomb has taken place incrementally and largely in secret.'' Israel's apparent accession to the ranks of nuclear countries, he said this week, is a case in point. The article in The Sunday Times of London, based on interviews with a former Israeli nuclear technician, said Israel had well over 100 nuclear weapons. ''Without testing, Israel was capable of moving up the ladder,'' said Mr. Spector. ''They have really got a whole strategic system in place.'' Latin Relations Held Promising Analysts, including Mr. Spector, see some signs that the spread of nuclear weapons can be contained. Especially promising are steps taken by Argentina and Brazil, with nuclear power programs, in improving their relations. A continuing rivalry might have encouraged them to seek nuclear arms. Analysts also note that the possession of nuclear arms is only part of the strategic equation. Just as important is the ability to deliver them, either with planes or with missiles. This may be a factor, in particular, in view of British and French plans to quadruple their strategic, or long-range, nuclear forces in 10 years. An analysis published in August by Scientific American predicted that Britain's long-range forces would reach 500 warheads and France's 600 warheads by 1995, with most of the growth coming in submarine missile forces. The authors' computer models showed that France would be capable of inflicting fatalities of 81 million in an all-out assault on the Soviet Union, wiping out two-thirds of its industrial capacity. Britain would be capable of killing as many as 68 million and incapacitating up to half of Soviet industry, the article said. Moscow has indicated its readiness to ignore the British and French forces in any accord to eliminate Soviet and American medium-range missiles from Europe. But in view of the long-range nuclear potential of the two Western European nations, the Soviet Union is likely to consider this aspect before agreeing to dramatic reductions in strategic arms with the United States, analysts say.",1986-11-09T06:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,national-desk-u.s.
39455b38-83c2-41b6-a134-11e6e3beb2e1,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/us/san-onofre-could-hint-at-a-non-nuclear-future.html,Troubles at a 1960s-Era Nuclear Plant in California May Hint at the Future,"SAN ONOFRE STATE BEACH, Calif. — More than seven million people live within 50 miles of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, which is about halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego. But for decades, residents here largely accepted, if not exactly embraced, the hulking nuclear plant perched on the cliffs above this popular surfing beach as a necessary part of keeping the lights on in a state that uses more electricity than all of Argentina. “I don’t think about it too much,” said David Vichules, 55, who has been surfing here since before the plant opened in 1968. “I guess it’s risk and benefit.” All that changed, however, after the Fukushima Daiichi meltdown in Japan last year, followed in January by a small leak of radioactive steam here caused by the deterioration of steam tubes that had been damaged by vibration and friction. The twin generators at the San Onofre plant have been off-line for five months, and the plant has subsequently become a point of contention in the fight over nuclear power in the United States. The leak has galvanized opposition to the nuclear plant among local residents, who are calling for San Onofre to remain shuttered for good. Antinuclear activists from across the country have seized on problems at San Onofre as an opportunity to push California toward a future without nuclear power. “A lot of people have gotten involved since Fukushima, and now especially since San Onofre has been closed,” said Gary Headrick, the founder of San Clemente Green , a local environmental organization. “It’s really not worth living with this risk. We should shut it down.” The plant will remain shut through at least the end of the summer while the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Southern California Edison, the utility company that operates it, investigate the cause of the leak from the steam tubes. Officials have said repeatedly that the generators will restart only if they are deemed safe. Still, any efforts to permanently close the nuclear plant face the ever-growing appetite for electricity in Southern California. San Onofre, the largest power plant in the region, produced 2,200 megawatts, enough to power 1.4 million homes, and also helps import power to the region. The absence of these reactors is being felt now as Southern California moves into the hot summer months. Two retired generators from a natural gas plant have been temporarily fired up, and state energy officials have encouraged the public to conserve energy during peak hours. Without any power from San Onofre, a severe heat wave could bring rolling blackouts, but state energy officials said they expected to get through the summer without problems. “If we have a high-heat wave, and we don’t get cooperation from the public, we could have issues,” said Stephen Berberich, president of the California Independent System Operator , a nonprofit agency that manages the flow of electricity in the state. In 2009 and 2010, Southern California Edison spent nearly $700 million — financed by ratepayers — to install two new steam generators, which were supposed to keep San Onofre’s aging reactors running well into the future. But in June, federal regulatory officials announced that faulty computer modeling caused the generators’ steam tubes to deteriorate much more quickly than expected, which led to the leak in January. Lara Uselding, a spokeswoman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, called the leaks “unprecedented,” and said there was no plan for when the plant might be allowed to restart or what fixes would have to be made before then. Southern California Edison declined to make a spokesman available and responded to questions with a short written statement. “There is no timeline on safety,” it said. Local and national antinuclear activists say they will be satisfied only when the nuclear plant is shut down for good. Maria Mattioli, 44, is one of the area residents who have spoken to government officials in municipalities around the plant in recent months, urging them to lobby federal regulators to keep the plant closed. “I think it’s very important that we take a very close look at San Onofre and possibly shut it down,” Ms. Mattioli said. “My heart says shut it down. I don’t want to uproot myself and move to Arizona or somewhere else.” Damon Moglen, a spokesman for Friends of the Earth, notes that California already has a law that prevents the construction of nuclear reactors, and said the shutdown at San Onofre gives the state an opportunity to prepare for the day when both its nuclear plants are shut down. “You cannot run San Onofre and Diablo Canyon forever,” Mr. Moglen said, referring to the state’s only other nuclear plant, in San Luis Obispo County. “California could be the first really big state to come to grips with a post-nuclear energy program.” For the moment, though, California energy officials may have few options aside from nuclear power — which remains relatively inexpensive to produce and does not add to greenhouse gases — especially if they hope to meet aggressive goals for reducing the state’s carbon emissions by 2020. “We are really faced with a choice, at least in the next decade,” said Per Peterson, a professor of engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. “Do we turn off nuclear plants first, or do we turn off coal plants first? You have to do one or the other.”",2012-07-05T05:36:24.000+02:00,NYTIMES,national-u.s.
bbc7ef3b-e035-4501-abb8-447fbbe0c346,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/business/global/24eunuke.html,German Chancellor Calls for Tests of Europe’s Nuclear Reactors,"BRUSSELS — The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is pushing for the European Union to conduct “stress tests” on all the nuclear reactors of its member countries in the wake of Japan’s calamity. Critics of the proposal want to know whether it is a political maneuver, or whether there are real safety issues with the 143 power reactors now operating throughout the bloc. Mrs. Merkel plans to meet with other European Union heads of state and government on Thursday to discuss what they should do to ensure the safety of the reactors on European soil — a bigger fleet than the 100 or so operating in the United States. By agreeing to the tests, European leaders would take a “fundamental” step to ensure the future of nuclear power in Europe, Luis Echávarri, director general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Nuclear Energy Agency, said during an interview Wednesday. “We cannot accept any plant in Europe that has not gone through this assessment,” Mr. Echávarri said. Over all, the European Union gets about 30 percent of its power from nuclear energy, but deep divisions over safety and radioactive waste persist in Europe. So far, governments have said the tests should be voluntary. But some analysts have already said that stress tests are little more than a hollow slogan that should, if anything, stoke fears about the adequacy of the current safety regime in Europe. “By proposing stress tests, are leaders saying that the normal safety inspections aren’t being done appropriately?” said Mycle Schneider, an independent energy analyst in Paris and a critic of the nuclear industry. “That would be a frightening statement.” Governments have not yet agreed on how to structure tests for reactors of the widely varied designs and locations of the European fleet. But Mr. Echávarri said the exercise would be valuable because European Union energy ministers this week committed to undertaking “a comprehensive risk and safety assessment” in light of new evidence from Japan that natural disasters could be more drastic than the worst forecasts. In particular, Mr. Echávarri said the assessment should determine which inland and coastal reactors in Europe needed to be protected from floods and waves that could reach heights greater than previously foreseen. If the assessments revealed the need for “extremely expensive” modifications, then “you have to consider whether that plant should be shut down or not,” Mr. Echávarri said. Günther Oettinger, the European energy commissioner, has said the tests are likely to focus, in part, on ensuring reliable supplies of backup power to keep reactors cool in emergencies. The absence of power in Japan after the earthquake and tsunami led to overheating at the Fukushima Daiichi reactors — a problem that engineers still are struggling to control. While only 14 European Union members operate nuclear reactors to generate power, all 27 member countries and their neighbors could be affected by any serious accident. France, with 58 reactors, is almost entirely dependent on nuclear for electricity and is its strongest advocate. Britain, also a supporter, generates less than a fifth of its power from nuclear, but it wants to refresh its fleet to head off an expected electricity shortage. But Austria banned the technology in the 1970s, and there are deep-seated concerns in Europe, stoked by the accident at Chernobyl, in Ukraine, in 1986. Greece and Ireland also are staunchly antinuclear. Even pronuclear governments have beaten a retreat as events have unfolded in Japan. Italy on Wednesday halted any decisions and research into suitable locations for nuclear sites. The government of Silvio Berlusconi had recently planned a return to nuclear power in Italy, which abandoned it after Chernobyl. Christian Egenhofer, the head of the energy and climate program at the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels, said the tests, even if they were overseen in part by the European Commission, the European Union’s executive body, would not lead to centralization of the nuclear safety regime in Europe. The European Union would set minimum rules, he said, but member states would zealously guard their right to carry out their own inspections. Mr. Schneider, the industry critic, said that rather than stress tests, the review should involve an overhaul of the safety regime to make sure any enhanced inspections are done frequently. In particular, Mr. Schneider said Europe must move spent fuel held in pools of water, as at the stricken plant in Japan, to dry storage. Emergency crews in Japan this week were still dumping tons of seawater into a boiling storage pool holding spent nuclear fuel at one of the units there. “The only reason we don’t put fuel in dry storage is because the industry says it’s costly,” Mr. Schneider said. “We don’t need a new review to learn that.”",2011-03-23T21:23:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-global-business

So when Finland, a country with a long memory of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and considerable environmental bona fides, chose to move ahead this year with the construction of the world's largest nuclear reactor, the nuclear industry portrayed it as a victory, one that would force the rest of Western Europe to take note. But the decision to build the reactor, Olkiluoto 3, Europe's first in 15 years, was not taken quickly or lightly. The proposal, which was fiercely opposed by the Green Party, wound its way through nearly every committee in Parliament, was the subject of intense lobbying and was exhaustively covered by Finland's numerous newspapers. Ultimately, the 1,600 megawatt reactor was approved in 2002 by a vote of 107 to 92. Construction began this year in Olkiluoto, a small island on Finland's southwestern shore. The plant is scheduled to open in 2009. ''There was only one question that has been discussed more in Parliament, and that was Finland's E.U. membership,'' said Anneli Nikula, vice president for corporate communications at Teollisuuden Voima Oy, the Finnish power group that is building Olkiluoto 3 and operates two of Finland's four existing reactors. ''All the facts were on the table.'' Now, with continued spikes in gas and fuel prices, fears about overdependence on foreign oil and the growing threat of global warming, Finland's decision to embrace nuclear energy appears prescient. A number of countries that have turned away from nuclear power in recent decades, including the United States, are reconsidering their options and freshening up languishing proposals to build nuclear plants. Others with a renewed interest in nuclear energy include Britain, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Hungary and Slovakia. ''There is an expectation that others will follow, both because of the way the decision was made and the boosting of confidence in being able to get through all the oppositional fear-mongering,'' said Ian Hore-Lacy, the director of public communications for the World Nuclear Association, an industry lobbying group. The United States, which has not had a nuclear plant on order since 1978, is experiencing a groundswell of interest. Taking the first step in a long process, Constellation Energy, a Baltimore-based holding company, announced in late October that it would apply to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for permission to construct and operate a pressurized water reactor like the kind being built in Finland, possibly in upstate New York or Maryland. The Finnish reactor, designed by Areva, the French state-controlled nuclear power group, is being built by Framatome ANP, a joint venture of Areva and Siemens, a Germany company. In addition, President Bush signed into law an energy bill in August that offers billions of dollars in research and development funds and construction subsidies to companies willing to build new nuclear plants. Several utility companies have applied for early site permits, a preliminary step toward building reactors. Worldwide, the resurgent interest in nuclear power is even more pronounced. Twenty-three reactors are under construction this year in 10 countries, most of them in Asia, which has aggressively pursued nuclear energy. India is building eight reactors. China and Taiwan are building a total of four reactors and are planning eight more. Russia is building four and South Korea is planning eight. The Finnish government first sought approval to build its fifth nuclear reactor in 1993, while memories of the Chernobyl catastrophe lingered. Few were willing to accept the risks. Twelve years later, a skittish and uncertain energy market has changed everything. Global warming, Finland's dependence on foreign sources of natural gas and oil, and the potential impact of high electricity prices on Finland's crucial energy-intensive industries have managed to trump concerns about nuclear energy's safety and waste. That same shift is occurring in many other countries as well, with a few notable holdouts, including Germany, Sweden and Belgium. At the same time, the nuclear industry, which says its newer reactors are safer and more affordable, deftly reframed the debate, focusing on the potential benefits to the economy and environment. Finland takes seriously its commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to lower carbon dioxide emissions, which are produced in large quantities by burning oil, coal and gas, a position that weighed heavily in the reactor's favor. ''The climate change debate was not here 10 years ago,'' said Oras Tynkkynen, a Green Party member of Parliament who opposed the reactor and accused the government of failing to pursue renewable energy -- wind power, for example -- as a solution. ''Now all they say is we have this terrible problem with climate change and we need to do something about it. It's hard to refute in 15 seconds.'' Nuclear energy's selling points were timely: it does not create emissions, unlike coal, oil and gas, and provides predictable electricity prices, a major bonus for Finnish industries, nuclear proponents said. ''The only viable alternative, if we want to maintain the structure of the economy, maintain our industries and meet our Kyoto targets, is nuclear,'' said Juha Rantanen, the chief executive officer of Outokumpu, one of the world's largest steel producers and one of Finland's biggest energy users. ''We can't have a declining economy. We face huge challenges and an aging population. Something had to be done.'' Environmentalists, however, argued that nuclear reactors could never be entirely safe. They are always radioactive, and their waste remains toxic for 100,000 years. But the designers of Areva's pressurized water reactor, which is costing $3.5 billion to build, helped counter those arguments. In the event of a core meltdown, they said, the nuclear material would flow into a separate enclosure for cooling. They also said that the reactor is being built with enough concrete to withstand the impact of an airliner. In the end, Finland's largest trade union supported the project, basically sealing the deal. Environmentalists, who argue that building more nuclear reactors simply allows the government to put off serious investment in alternative energy, are now confronting possible plans for a sixth reactor in Finland. ''It makes life nice for 10 years,'' Mr. Tynkkynen said. ''But in the long term it causes trouble.'' Correction: December 14, 2005, Wednesday An article on Monday about the planned expansion of nuclear power in Finland misstated the business of a large Finnish industrial company that supports the expansion and is one of the country's biggest users of energy.

For the last month, Dominion Resources, of Richmond, has been competing with Entergy Nuclear, of Jackson, Miss., to buy the Indian Point 3 plant, in Westchester County, and the James A. FitzPatrick plant in Oswego County. Both companies had submitted initial offers of what they said was more than $800 million, then tried to top each other with revised bids and projections that would represent the largest sale of nuclear plants in the nation's history. The power authority was supposed to choose a buyer on Monday at a meeting in Manhattan. But the meeting turned into an 11-hour marathon, held mostly behind closed doors, and ended with a brief announcement postponing a decision until next week because of tax, legal and financial questions. As a result, Dominion's offer expired. But yesterday, Thomas F. Farrell, the chief executive of Dominion Energy, the nuclear subsidiary of Dominion Resources, faxed a brief letter to David E. Blabey, executive vice president and general counsel, to the power authority, indicating that Dominion was resubmitting its bid, said Mark Lazenby, a Dominion spokesman. ''We're back to the two,'' said Stephen Shoenholz, a power authority spokesman. The letter did not, however, address the major stumbling block in Dominion's bid: how to avoid any tax liability when the two plants are decommissioned. The power authority is expected to pay for the costs of decommissioning and has been building a fund, now valued at $630 million, in anticipation of these obligations. By 2015, when the licenses of both plants are to expire, that fund is expected to stand at $1.9 billion, which is more than enough to cover the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's projection of $1.18 billion to decommission the plants. Anything left over would be kept by the power authority. But if the fund were subject to taxes because the power authority sold its plants to a private entity like Entergy or Dominion, or if that fund were to be counted as taxable income for the new owner, then taxes would eat into that $1.9 billion. And if that new taxed figure were less than the N.R.C.'s $1.18 billion, the new owner would have to make up the difference. According to the power authority, Entergy has resolved the issue satisfactorily, while Dominion has not.",2000-03-23T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

He was 73 and lived in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., and St. Francisville, La. He apparently suffered a heart attack while riding to a hotel from Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, the Power Authority reported. He was in Texas as a consultant for Texas Utilities, a former employer. The New York Power Authority announced a month ago that Mr. Cahill, a 40-year veteran of the industry, was stepping down as its chief nuclear officer while remaining available as a consultant to the authority and others in the industry. The agency put him in charge of its nuclear-power program in April 1994 when it was having difficulties with its generating plants, Indian Point 3 in Westchester County and James A. FitzPatrick in Oswego County. At the time Federal regulators listed the two plants among the worst-run in the country in 1993. The problem, they said, was bad management, not the age of the equipment. FitzPatrick, in Scriba, N.Y., came off the list in 1994. Indian Point 3 at Buchanan, N.Y., emerged from a six-month shutdown a year ago, when it was reported on the mend after a three-year rebuilding. Jack Murphy, a spokesman for the New York Power Authority, said recently that FitzPatrick was taken out of service for refueling in 1966 for 47 days, the shortest and most effective such down-time in its history. Both FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3 are currently performing at about 100 percent of their capacity, he said. The agency credited Mr. Cahill with the substantial progress shown at both plants. He was born in Stony Point, N.Y., and graduated in mechanical engineering from Polytechnic University (then Institute) of Brooklyn in 1949. He started his career that year with the Consolidated Edison Company. He held various engineering posts and took part in the licensing, design, construction and operation of the nuclear generating plants at Indian Point. He helped design Indian Point 1 at Buchanan, the nation's first civilian nuclear power plant. It began operation in 1962 but became an economic liability in the mid-1970's for want of up-to-date safety equipment and was decommissioned in 1980. Gazing at its low, rounded dome that snowy February day, Mr. Cahill commented, ''It's the end of the beginning.'' He left in 1980 as a vice president and became a senior vice president for the Gulf State Utilities Company of St. Francisville, La. In 1988 he joined Texas Utilities as group vice president for nuclear production and oversaw the commissioning of its two-unit Comanche Peak Nuclear Project in 1990 and 1993. Mr. Cahill is survived by his wife of 43 years, Edna Kiernan Cahill; a son, William E., of Deer Park, L.I.; two daughters, Kathleen, of Catskill, N.Y., and Madeleine, of Hadley, Mass.; a sister, Gloria Fetterhoff of Harrisburg, Pa., and three grandchildren.",1997-03-09T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,obituaries

IN SIBERIA, IT'S HIGH Before a reactor exploded at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in the Ukraine a year ago, officials at the Bilibino atomic energy station had not thought of how they might evacuate residents from this industrialized island in the tundra of northeast Siberia. Before a reactor exploded at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in the Ukraine a year ago, officials at the Bilibino atomic energy station had not thought of how they might evacuate residents from this industrialized island in the tundra of northeast Siberia. Now, according to the plant's chief engineer, Bilibino has a contingency plan for airlifting thousands of residents to safety within five hours in the event of an accident. But officials here say the reverberations of the Chernobyl explosion on April 26 of last year have not provoked second thoughts about the Soviet Government's plans for a dramatic expansion of its nuclear power output, including construction of several new nuclear plants here in the northeast. Paradoxically, in the eyes of Western diplomats, although the Chernobyl explosion and fire - the world's worst commercial nuclear power accident - have shaken popular support for nuclear power in the West and set back plans for new plants, the Soviet Union has stayed on a course that calls for doubling nuclear power capacity by 1990. Added Arctic Hazards ''Chernobyl more or less killed nuclear power in Italy, slowed it a bit in France and didn't help it anywhere else in the West,'' a Western diplomat in Moscow said. ''But it doesn't seem to have slowed things here.'' At the time of the Chernobyl accident, nuclear plants generated about 11 percent of the nation's total power. This put the Soviet Union in third place in the world in nuclear generation, behind the United States and France. The Soviet commitment to atomic energy is nowhere more striking than here, where new kilowatts are being added in the face of extraordinary costs and the special hazards posed by building above the Arctic Circle. A group of Western and Japanese reporters who toured the Bilibino plant was told that plans called for the addition of three new reactors at this site and construction of at least three similar plants in other cities of eastern Siberia. The Bilibino plant is the smallest in the country and the only one east of the Lena River, the demarcation line for the sparsely settled region called the Far East. Its four 12-megawatt reactors provide power to a nearby gold mine and across the tundra to the Arctic port towns of Pevek and Chersky. The High Cost of Building The plant, whose first reactor went on line in 1973, also generates hot water that runs through conduits snaking above the snow to heat the concrete-block settlement of 14,000 people several miles away. The chief engineer, Aleksandr S. Zolotilin, said the cost of building power plants in the Far East was about $2,500 per kilowatt-hour, triple the cost of building in more hospitable locations. The extra costs come from the high price of transporting building materials to a site nine time zones from Moscow and from the technical complexity of building on permafrost. The roads that serve Bilibino from the Arctic ports are winter roads, called zimniks, open only from October to May. In warmer weather, when the top few feet of frozen earth softens in the sunlight, the roads become impassable bogs, and all supplies must come in by plane or helicopter. The softening and refreezing, the movement of underground rivers and shifting ice make permafrost an unstable foundation for construction, according to Mr. Zolotilin. Keeping the Permafrost Solid The hazards are evident in the Bilibino settlement, where older apartment buildings are scarred by cracks where the summer thaw has caused the walls to buckle. To arrest the deterioration, builders have sunk pipes into the ground around these buildings and filled them with kerosene, which, because of its low freezing point, acts to refrigerate the permafrost and keep it solid. Newer buildings in Bilibino are erected on concrete stilts planted deep in the earth. For a nuclear plant, even such pylons did not offer enough security. The Bilibino power plant floats on a monolithic concrete slab. Mr. Zolotilin said Soviet engineers were confident enough they have mastered building on permafrost that three new 33-megawatt reactors would be built here and brought on line in the early 1990's. #3 New Plants Scheduled Soviet authorities have also scheduled construction of three entirely new Siberian plants modeled on Bilibino by the end of the century -one in the Arctic coastal town of Tiksi, one in the region of Yakutsk, a third on the shelf of the Karsk Sea, Mr. Zolotilin said. A fourth site is being considered in Mys Shmidta, on the Chukotsk Sea, he said. The main effect of Chernobyl on these plans, the engineer said, has been to make them more expensive, by more than 40 percent. At the existing Bilibino plant, which is a close cousin of the graphite-cooled reactors at Chernobyl, Mr. Zolotilin estimated that 3 million rubles ($4.5 million) were invested in new coolant pumps and other equipment as a direct consequence of the Chernobyl accident. The new plants will incorporate several safety measures that do not exist here, including more solid containment vessels covering the plants, more graphite control rods to keep the nuclear reactions in check, and safety features to prevent workers from pulling all of the control rods from the reactors. Volunteers for Chernobyl Plant officials conducted a quick tour through the control rooms, past the turbines and onto the floor above one of the reactors. The only sight that raised eyebrows was a pipe crudely bandaged in rags, evidently to control a leak. It was the kind of makeshift repair that is commonplace in Soviet industrial installations, a reminder of the national deficit of decent plumbing fittings. Mr. Zolotilin said the Bilibino plant had sent 150 people, all of whom he said were volunteers, to help in the cleanup of Chernobyl, a gesture of ''solidarity'' that he said was replicated at other plants throughout the country. ''We considered it a national tragedy,'' he said, ''and we tried to help as we could.'' BILIBINO JOURNAL",1987-04-20T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

Now the nation's largest supplier of electrical power, the T.V.A. finds itself facing a growing list of problems. Not only did the authority mismanage a $12 billion nuclear power program, according to critics in Congress, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other Federal agencies, but it also systematically ignored complaints of safety violations in its reactors and harassed and intimidated employees who spoke out about them. Some Units Canceled Although the agency has brought in a retired Navy admiral, Steven A. White, and outside consultants to repair the nuclear program, all five of the agency's working nuclear reactors remain out of service, shut down since August as a result of safety questions. Four more nearly completed units have been delayed indefinitely, and eight others were canceled because the agency concluded there was no market for their power. On Wednesday the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations Committee will conduct hearings into the authority's troubled nuclear power program and hear from, among others, quality-control engineers at the authority who said they were objects of retaliation when they complained about faulty construction and engineering in the agency's reactors. The engineers, part of an in-house safety staff set up by the authority in the aftermath of the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island, said the authority routinely ignored their reports of, among other things, faulty welding and electrical connections in the agency's reactors. The closing of the nuclear plants has raised grave questions about the financial future of the agency, which must get its operating reactors on line again or force ratepayers to absorb $12 billion worth of bad investments. The agency has already estimated that the loss of its nuclear generating capacity is costing $1 million a day in extra fuel and production costs. But the agency's problems have also wrought serious political damage, both among unhappy ratepayers in the Valley and members of Congress, where the authority's historical autonomy as one of the enduring and successful legacies of the New Deal is under sharp challenge from even sympathetic lawmakers. ''What we are seeing at T.V.A. now is a tragedy, the culmination of years of blunders, of operating without any kind of accountability to ratepayers, to regulators or anyone else,'' said Representative Ronnie G. Flippo, the Alabama Democrat who heads the House T.V.A. Caucus and who has proposed legislation to restructure the agency's management. Charles H. Dean, the former Knoxville utility official who was appointed by President Reagan as chairman of the agency, admits these are rough times. ''A lot of people are after us,'' said Mr. Dean, who does not disagree that the agency has been guilty of poor management and bad internal communications in operating its nuclear program. 'Everyone Is Pecking on Us' ''It's like when the sick chicken gets out in the feed lot and all the other chickens peck on it,'' said Mr. Dean. ''Well, we're the sick chicken, and everyone is pecking on us.'' To a degree, the agency's problems reflect those of the nuclear industry as a whole. Thirty-five nuclear plants already under construction have been canceled because utilities in the 1960's and 1970's overestimated future consumer demand for electrical power, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. David Freeman, a former member of the T.V.A. board, who in the early 1980's urged the agency to cut back on its nuclear program. said: ''T.V.A. did not uniquely mishandle nuclear power. It was mishandled by Federal agencies that had a blind faith in its future, and now we are paying for their mistakes.'' But James Asselstine, a member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission who is one of the authority's sharpest critics, says that while Federal regulators were not vigilant enough, the problem facing the authority is much more enormous than that facing other utilities. ''Questions about quality assurance are pervasive throughout their program,'' he said. For example, inspections of welds in the Watts Bar plant, which the agency sought to have licensed earlier this year despite arguments from its own engineers that it was unsafe, were conducted after the pipes were painted. As a result, the licensing of the plant, at Spring City, Tenn., has been delayed indefinitely. ''They simply refused to learn from their mistakes,'' said Jerry Smith, a senior engineer who says he was demoted, harrassed and received death threats after speaking out about safety problems. $1 Million in Fines Over the years, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has imposed more than $1 million in fines against the agency for safety and operational violations in its nuclear program and has consistently complained of deficiencies in its overall nuclear program. In an 18-month period ended in February 1985, T.V.A. sites received three times as many citations for violations as the national average for other utilities. Still, some critics have argued that blame for the agency's problems must be shared by Federal nuclear regulators because they allowed the situation to get out of hand. Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is convening the hearings on Wednesday, has accused the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of doing a ''dismal'' job of overseeing the T.V.A. program. Even the authority's ambitious efforts to repair its nuclear blunders have run into controversy. The General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, said last week that the contract between the authority and the man it hired last January to rebuild its nuclear program was illegal. That is because the $355,200-a-year salary being paid by the authority to Admiral White, who was a procurement chief and nuclear submarine fleet commander, is five times higher than the agency's statutory pay limit of $72,300 a year. In addition, the authority's inspector general has ordered a review of Mr. White's hiring of outside contractors because of ''potential serious conflicts of interest,'' a statement that prompted Admiral White to threaten to quit if there were continuing challenges to his integrity. Although it was created in 1933 to bring economic assistance and jobs to what was then the most economicaly depressed region in the country, the authority today is basically an electrical utility. It serves 7.8 million people in Tennessee and parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia and Kentucky, and last year collected $5 billion in revenue. In addition to its nuclear power activities, the agency operates 12 coal-burning power plants, 30 hydroelectric generating plants and dams, and employs 30,000 workers. Some critics and even officials within the authority argue that the agency's difficulties in dealing with its nuclear power program were in part a result of the agency's own internal mystique. 'An Attitude in the Agency' ''There has been an attitude in the agency, from the days of dam-building, that if T.V.A. builds it, it's the best,'' said Mr. Waters. ''You didn't need an inspector to tell you what was good. Then these same people, these engineers, got into the nuclear side and what they were doing just flat didn't work.'' Mr. Waters and Mr. Dean are carrying an extra burden these days. The third member of the agency's three-member board, Richard Freeman, who is not related to David Freeman, resigned last February, citing unspecified personal reasons. Although he has refused to elaborate on his reasons for leaving, his departure was read by many people as just one sign of the agency's internal difficulties. Both Mr. Waters and Mr. Dean agree mistakes have been made. ''We understand that we have to win back the confidence of the people, the Congress and the N.R.C. before we can start the reactors back up,'' he said. Neither Admiral White nor the T.V.A. has said when it expects to have any of its five working reactors back on line. They include three reactors at the Browns Ferry plant in Decatur, Ala., and two others at the Sequoyah plant in Soddy-Daisy, Tenn.",1986-06-11T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,national-desk-u.s.

In the last two decades, nuclear plants have won permits to uprate, meaning add capacity to reactors, with almost no opposition. With these upgrades, plus expanded working hours and 20-year extensions on operating licenses, the nuclear industry has expanded its electrical output to a point that safety experts say could be dangerous. For their part, plant owners say they are modernizing in way that can improve safety. But a battle line has been drawn over an application by Entergy Nuclear to raise a reactor's power output by 20 percent. Some nuclear engineers outside the company hope they can mount a serious technical challenge to this application so it will not sail through as the previous 99 applications have. Entergy Nuclear applied in September to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for permission to raise the power output of a 32-year-old reactor it owns, the Vermont Yankee, by 20 percent. In considering additions of capacity the commission has changed the way it measures the risk that emergency cooling water, which is needed to dissipate heat at the higher power level, will boil into steam during an accident. If the water turned into steam, it would make cooling impossible, the fuel could melt, and radioactive material would be released. The Vermont plant is exempt from some government safety regulations because it was licensed before they were written, and it is now trying to reduce its safety margin ''far beyond anything that could be licensed today,'' said Paul M. Blanch, an engineer with decades of experience in the nuclear field. While no one has ordered a new nuclear plant in this country since 1973, except for those that were canceled before completion, the 103 reactors now licensed have not only added capacity but will add the equivalent of another two or three plants in the next few years, industry and government experts say. These uprates, involving mostly minor changes that allow more power production, helped allow the nuclear industry's share of American power production to stay around 20 percent even with no new plants. Plant managers say that the Vermont Yankee, in Vernon, Vt., just north of the Massachusetts border, was built with enormous unused capacity. And nuclear experts, even some who say that Vermont Yankee's application should receive extra close scrutiny, say that increasing power output can make a plant safer because modernization may include installing more precise, reliable components. According to Entergy's plans, when Vermont Yankee is next refueled with fresh uranium, technicians will put in more of the type that is easily split to produce energy, and workers will install water pumps that will deliver more water so the reactor can produce more steam. The company will also install a new turbine, which takes the energy of the steam and uses it to turn a shaft, and a new generator, which uses the shaft's energy to make electricity. The reactor's current capacity of 524 megawatts of electricity would rise to 634; one megawatt would keep 1,000 window air-conditioners running. Experts say this upgrade will probably cost about $60 million -- far less expensive than creating the equivalent by building a new plant. Fuel expenses would rise somewhat, but not the long-term labor and maintenance costs. That economic logic has appealed to the nuclear industry, especially as the electric industry restructured over the last few years and some reactors were sold. ''As people began to look at competitive markets and renewing the operating licenses, they said, 'If I make a little more investment in this plant, I can uprate it even further,' '' said Marvin Fertel, the chief nuclear officer at the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry trade group. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's most recent tally, last March, showed that 79 plants had won permission to increase output and that seven applications besides that of the Vermont Yankee were pending. At the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Mohammed A. Shuaibi, a senior project manager, said, ''A lot of rigorous analysis, and changes to plant hardware, are done to make sure the plants continue to be safe at the higher power level.'' Entergy bought Vermont Yankee from a group of New England utilities in July 2002. One selling point was that it was like a used car driven only on Sundays -- it had never had an uprate and would probably qualify for a big one. But at Vermont Yankee, there are questions about the risk that the emergency cooling water will boil into steam. At the current maximum allowable power level, the emergency water could be heated to 183 degrees, well short of the boiling point at normal atmospheric pressure, 212 degrees. After a 20 percent uprate, that could rise to 194 degrees. During an accident the emergency pumps suck in huge volumes of water, lowering the pressure inside the pump. That could allow bubbles of steam to develop. Reactor owners argue that an accident would probably involve a leak, and that would create steam in the reactor building, keep the water pressurized in the pump and prevent it from boiling. Jay K. Thayer, the site vice president for Entergy Nuclear at Vermont Yankee, said the company's plan was conservative because in an accident, pressures would be far higher than the company projected in its application. ''We don't use everything that's available,'' he said. ''We subtract to assure that there's margin there.'' Until the last few years, the commission would not allow such assumptions to guide its rulings. In the 1990's, two reactors in New England were identified by the commission as having a risk of boiling at atmospheric pressure. The owners shut the reactors rather than fix this and other problems. But Vermont Yankee has applied under the current rules and has asserted that pressure would be sufficient during an accident, at least 6.1 pounds at the beginning, and would stay higher than atmospheric pressure for 50 hours, Mr. Thayer said, leaving a substantial safety margin. Others argue, though, that there are far too many accident scenarios in which the atmospheric pressure might not build up -- for example, if there were small leaks or a breach of the containment building during a terrorist attack or failure of part of the containment system. David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit group that is often critical of nuclear safety, said the commission had previously rejected owners arguments about pressure preventing boiling water because ''it is hard to guarantee the pressure will always be there when needed.'' In general, all reactor safety equipment has to have backups. But Vermont Yankee was licensed before the backup requirement went into place. Mr. Blanch and others argue that this loophole could make the plant vulnerable to a severe accident if a single component failed after the emergency cooling system was required. William K. Sherman, the Vermont state nuclear engineer, sent the Nuclear Regulatory Commission a letter in December expressing doubts about the reactor's application and its reliance on high pressure in an emergency. ''What is the safety implication,'' he wrote, of counting on extra pressure in an emergency?",2004-01-26T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

The Philadelphia Electric Company's long-idled Peach Bottom nuclear power plant in central Pennsylvania could be restarted in April if no more serious problems are uncovered, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Friday. In a report issued after 1,100 hours of inspection of Peach Bottom, officials of the commission said the company's program to correct problems at the plant ''was being effectively implemented.'' The agency cited two small problems but said that those did not not contradict the overall favorable review. The agency closed Peach Bottom in March 1987 after control-room operators were found asleep at their posts. The shutdown has cost Philadelphia Electric more than $200 million for repairs and replacement power and prompted a lawsuit by the plant's co-owners, a slap from regulators and nuclear industry officials and the replacement of top management. William Jones, a spokesman for Philadelphia Electric, said the company was pleased with the Federal report and was confident it could quickly correct the remaining problems. They involve the recent installation of a backup air supply system and the training of workers in radiation protection. ''We are confident we can remain on schedule for an April restart,'' Mr. Jones said. The company has said that an April restart would return the plant to full operation by summer. Steps Before Relicensing William Kane, director of the nuclear commission's division of reactor projects, said that while today's report was a milestone in efforts to restart the plant, important steps remain before it is relicensed. The steps include further agency inspections, two public meetings, a final recommendation by the inspection team and a review by the agency's five commissioners. Restart of the plant on the Susquehanna River has been delayed several times due to the commission's dissatisfaction with Philadelphia Electric management.b The Peach Bottom plant opened in 1974 and initially earned impressive marks for safety and performance. Officials at Philadelphia Electric said problems began this decade after the company shifted its focus to the building of two nuclear power units at the company's Limerick plant outside Philadelphia. Problems After Shutdown Problems mounted after the shutdown, including the arrest and dismissal of eight employees on drug charges. One year ago, the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, an industry group that monitors nuclear power plants, called Peach Bottom ''an embarrassment to the industry and to the nation.'' Philadelphia Electric was later fined $1.25 million by the regulatory commission and forced by state regulators to remove Peach Bottom from its rate base until the plant reopens. The company has been sued by the plant's three co-owners for recovery of an estimated $500 million of costs from the shutdown. These developments prompted the early retirement last year of James Everett, chairman of Philadelphia Electric, and John Austin, company president, and installation of a new management team.",1989-02-19T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

This is indeed a despicable practice, which flies in the face of the facts. Ms. Cohen states that she learned of the case while living in West Africa a few years ago. Our African friends will also take issue with her because she bases this on hearsay, and the allegation is an insult to the African countries engaged in economic cooperation with China. Economic cooperation is a two-way business based on equality and mutual benefit. To provide the best possible labor service, the relevant Chinese enterprises have selected workers and other personnel for labor service contracts by strictly screening their moral character and technical and managerial skills. Through their dedication, hard work and personal sacrifice, they have won wide acclaim and respect from Africans. As to so-called export of convict labor products, what prisoners produce in the factories under prisons is mainly for their own consumption and for improving their living conditions and welfare. Only a small surplus is sold on domestic markets through normal channels. Chinese authorities on economic and trade administration have never granted reform-through-labor units rights to engage in foreign trade. On another matter, Leslie Gelb writes in ""China Ties About to Snap"" (column, April 24): ""Chinese leaders also startled Washington by secretly helping Algeria to build a nuclear reactor . . . too small to generate electricity profitably and too large for research, but just right to make material for nuclear weapons."" In February 1983, China and Algeria signed a protocol on nuclear cooperation, in which China agreed to provide Algeria with a heavy-water reactor for research. The power of the reactor is very small, with a designed power of 10 megawatts and maximum thermal power of 15 megawatts. Because China was not a party to the International Atomic Energy Agency in 1983, there was no question of submitting to the agency's safeguards or supervision. However, we asked the Algerian Government to pledge that the reactor be used only for peaceful purposes, and it made a clear promise to that effect. Since China joined the International Atomic Energy Agency in 1984, we have made acceptance of its safeguards and supervision a precondition for nuclear exports. To my knowledge, Algeria will brief the agency on our nuclear cooperation. China does not encourage or engage in nuclear proliferation, nor help other countries develop nuclear weapons. Three principles guide China's nuclear exports: guarantee for peaceful use, submission to International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards and supervision and nontransfer to third countries.

The North Koreans would have to agree, however, to full and open accounting, verification and unannounced inspection. International Atomic Energy Agency and American experts understand that this is feasible. Americans have been told that any nuclear fuel reprocessing is equivalent to being within reach of making bombs. In theory, this is a possibility. In practical engineering terms, it is very far-fetched: it would require highly sophisticated techniques and experienced people (such as certain specialists at our weapons laboratories), and the risk of international detection long before completion would be very high. Nothing short of full safeguards should be required on a nuclear power fuel cycle for any country, the U.S. and other weapons states included, particularly for one with a history of being a closed society. But with proper safeguards, power reactor fuel can be reprocessed and recycled with safety and with verifiable safeguards against diversion for weapons purposes. A.

The plant hasn’t produced electricity in decades, but it is still staffed by several thousand workers who oversee the plant’s fuel and waste storage. The International Atomic Energy Agency said today that it saw “no critical impact on safety” at the complex. The American Nuclear Society agreed, saying, “The loss of power is a serious matter, but it does not pose a threat to the public.” In general, nuclear plants need electricity for pumps that circulate water to keep nuclear material from overheating. But the used fuel assemblies at Chernobyl are old enough that circulating pumps are not needed. And the I.A.E.A. said Chernobyl had enough water in its cooling ponds, which store radioactive waste. More worryingly, the I.A.E.A. said it had lost communications with its radiation monitors and other sensors at the plant. Although that does not pose an immediate threat, it means that there would be no effective way of detecting a rise in radiation levels or determining quickly where it was coming from. Rafael Grossi, the director of the I.A.E.A., said he would attend meetings in Turkey tomorrow with Russia and Ukraine on ensuring the safety of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. The shelling last week at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex in southern Ukraine, a massive and fully functioning nuclear power site, was denounced by President Biden as “reckless.”",2022-03-10T00:05:18.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

But Senator Richard H. Bryan of Nevada accused the network yesterday of caving in to pressure from lobbyists for nuclear power companies. Senator Bryan, a Democrat, said he had only circumstantial evidence that NBC had been so influenced, but he pointed to the fact that NBC's parent company, General Electric, has significant interests in the nuclear power industry. NBC executives said G.E. had no input in their decision. The film, ''Atomic Train,'' centers on a train traveling from Idaho to Colorado that loses its brakes and threatens Denver because of a nuclear bomb that has been put on board. That much of the plot is unaffected. But the film also repeatedly made reference to a cargo of nuclear waste products. NBC ordered all mentions of nuclear waste in the film dialogue overdubbed so that the words are now ''hazardous waste.'' NBC immediately removed all the promotions for the film, which had carried the inference that the events in the film were based in reality. NBC had also sent out news releases, which cited supposedly real instances of nuclear waste being transported on trains in Western states. The network insisted that a disclaimer be added to the beginning of the film and at every long commercial break telling viewers that what they are seeing is a work of fiction. Rosalyn P. Weinman, the executive vice president of content policy for NBC, said that she made the decision to change the film. ''We had not vetted this film as though it were fact-based,'' she said. ''There was apparently a disconnect between the way the movie was promoted and what had been intended to be an old-fashioned thriller.'' She said NBC's promotion department had been trying to ''generate heat'' about the movie. NBC sought out the advice of several scientists, Ms. Weinman said, who told the network ''nuclear waste is never shipped by train.'' But Senator Bryan cited a bill currently before Congress, which would ship 77,000 metric tons of waste through 43 states, some by highway and some by rail. The waste is intended for a depository in Nevada. ''G.E. is a member of the Nuclear Energy Institute,'' Senator Bryan said. ''And they own NBC.''

Credit... Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Power has again been restored at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility, reducing worries about an accident at one of the war’s most sensitive sites. But the head of the United Nations’ atomic watchdog warned that Ukrainian workers were under yet more intense pressure as Moscow tries to assert further control of the plant. While Ukrainian engineers have continued to operate the plant under the watch of Russian soldiers, Moscow recently said it was nationalizing the facility. The effort is part of a broader bid to claim, in a parade of formalities designed to give the moves a sheen of legitimacy, that parts of Ukraine are now Russian. The nuclear plant sits in one of four Ukrainian provinces that President Vladimir V. Putin declared this month had been annexed to Russia — a move that has been widely rejected and condemned as illegal. Late Friday, Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in a statement that employees at the nuclear plant were now facing “unacceptable pressure” to sign employment contracts with the Russian nuclear energy company, Rosatom, in defiance of Kyiv. That pressure only adds to the stresses on the workers that Ukrainian officials have been warning about for months, saying that Russian soldiers had subjected already fatigued staff to harsh interrogations and torture. Holding the plant gives Moscow a military advantage but also significant leverage over Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Russian authorities could also, in theory, connect the facility to their own grid, funneling power south to Ukrainian territory that they have seized. Amid the continuing management struggle between Moscow and Kyiv, Ukraine’s nuclear power company said this week that Russia had kidnapped another senior official from the plant, expressing fears he could be forced to disclose information about Ukrainian personnel working there. The head of the plant had previously been detained and released. Ukraine’s state energy company, Energoatom, said on the Telegram messaging app on Saturday that it had set up a hotline for workers at the plant that could be used by “everyone who has information about cases of kidnapping and torture” by Russian authorities. Despite Russia’s claims to have nationalized the plant, the International Atomic Energy Agency says that it views the plant as Ukrainian, since the U.N. charter does not recognize illegal annexations. In a “much needed development,” the Ukrainian engineers who have been working at the Zaporizhzhia site under intense Russian pressure had managed to restore backup power, ending the plant’s reliance on diesel generators. Most nuclear power plants consider diesel generators a last line of defense to be used only in extreme circumstances. It was the second time in recent days that shelling had cut power lines that feed the cooling systems for the plant’s six reactors, all of which are shut down. The war marks the first time that a nuclear facility has become an active battle zone. Russia has stationed troops and artillery at the plant since seizing it in March. Ukrainian authorities say the Russians have shelled nearby cities from the plant’s grounds, aware of the risk of returning fire. A waste storage site has been hit several times, and power lines have been a frequent target. Each side has blamed the other for the attacks. “Working in very challenging conditions, operating staff at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant are doing everything they can to bolster its fragile off-site power situation,” Mr. Grossi said. “Restoring the backup power connection is a positive step in this regard, even though the overall nuclear safety and security situation remains precarious.” The Zaporizhzhia plant is not providing electricity to Ukraine’s grid, given that its reactors are shut down, but it needs its own power source for safety reasons. Workers have been wrestling for weeks with how to provide that. Mr. Grossi said that efforts to restart one of the reactors for that purpose would begin on Saturday in a process that would take several days. In addition, more diesel fuel has arrived, from both the Ukrainian and Russian side of the front line, to power Zaporizhzhia’s generators for at least 10 days should the plant again be cut off, he said.",2022-10-15T18:51:42.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Maternity Hospital Is Hit.,"The ruins of Chernobyl’s reactor No. 4, whose explosion and fire caused the worst nuclear accident in history, seen before the construction of a containment structure around it. Ukrainian government officials said Wednesday that damage by Russian forces had left the former Chernobyl nuclear power plant “disconnected” from outside electricity, leaving the site of the worst nuclear accident in history dependent on power from diesel generators. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations agency on nuclear power, said Wednesday that it saw “no critical impact on safety” at the complex. The American Nuclear Society, a professional group, agreed. “The loss of power is a serious matter but it does not pose a threat to the public,” it said in a statement. But officials warned that the situation around the plant, where there was an explosion and fire at one of the reactors in 1986, was still of grave concern. The plant has not produced electricity since the last of its four reactors was shut down in 2000, but if its generators stopped working, that could affect the operations to store the large quantities of radioactive nuclear waste there. Since the plant was captured by Russian forces not long after the invasion began last month, the I.A.E.A. has said that there have been interruptions in the feed of data it receives automatically from radiation monitors and other sensors at the plant. A full loss of power would cut that feed completely, leaving the agency’s experts with little knowledge of what is going on there, except what could be gathered using portable devices. On Tuesday, the I.A.E.A. said it had lost communications with its sensors at the plant. The most hazardous waste at Chernobyl is found in two locations. As is common practice in the nuclear power industry, used fuel from all four reactors is stored in pools of water that dissipates the heat produced as the fuel decays radioactively. When fuel is newly removed from a reactor, there is a lot of decay and thus a lot of heat, so plants need power to run pumps that circulate the storage water to remove excess heat. The I.A.E.A. has said that the used fuel assemblies at Chernobyl — there are more than 20,000 of them — are old enough and decayed enough that circulating pumps are not needed to keep them safe. “The heat load of the spent fuel storage pool and the volume of cooling water contained in the pool is sufficient to maintain effective heat removal without the need for electrical supply,” the agency said. The other main source of nuclear waste are the ruins of the destroyed reactor itself. An estimated 200 tons of fuel remain there, in a lava-like mix with molten concrete, sand and chemicals that were dumped on the reactor during the disaster. This mixture is found throughout the remains of the reactor. Some parts of it are completely inaccessible and have only been studied by boring into them. A functioning reactor requires pumps that circulate water around the core, keeping it cool and moderating the nuclear reaction to avoid a meltdown. There is no cooling water in the chaotic, jumbled remains of the reactor, so the loss of power would not affect them. But in recent years there have been incidents in which nuclear reactions have started spontaneously in pockets of these fuel-containing materials, leading to spikes in radiation levels. Without monitoring — of humidity in addition to radiation levels — workers would not know if any new incident was occurring. Since 2017, the destroyed reactor has been covered by a large arched structure, intended to confine the waste and safeguard against any release of radiation. The structure is also meant to allow the work of removing waste to long-term storage. The facility was only granted an operating license by Ukraine’s authorities last year, so that work had only just begun, and will take decades to complete. There are several large cranes and other specialized equipment to allow crews to work safely. Without power, most if not all of that work could not proceed. On Wednesday, Russia’s Energy Ministry said that Belarus, whose border is not far from the Chernobyl zone, was working on restoring the power supply of the complex from its own grid. William J.

How did you become interested in nuclear disarmament? I’ve always been interested in international issues. But as with many people who grew up after the Cold War, nuclear weapons didn’t feel relevant. I interned for a Swedish feminist peace organization called Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom in Geneva. I got thrown into these big U.N. meetings where Russia and the U.S. and China debated nuclear weapons, and I was completely fascinated because it was so bizarre. How so? Nuclear weapons just don’t make any sense! They’re sitting there with their papers talking about these crazy weapons that can end us all, and no one said: “This is crazy! What are we doing?” I was fascinated by the power dynamics, and I just got hooked. Many countries banned chemical weapons and land mines for being inhumane. Why haven’t we done the same for nuclear weapons? That’s the thing; we give them this exception to all sanity or reason. We have the Geneva Conventions that say that you can’t indiscriminately target civilians, but that’s just what nuclear weapons are designed to do. Nuclear bombs are a very old-fashioned weapon. And if you consider the kind of threats we’re facing today — climate change, organized crime, food security, that kind of stuff — you can’t fight terrorism with a nuclear bomb. So how do you do this work, day to day? Lots of emails, mostly. Talking to people. We have more than 460 organizations that are a part of this campaign network. Some are activists, some are connected to politicians and work to lobby parliaments, plus everything in between. It’s basically trying to raise awareness of this issue. What is the aim of the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons that the U.N. adopted in July? There’s always been this idea that we need to get rid of nuclear arms that even leaders of the nuclear-arms states have sort of supported. For instance, Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize partly for his Prague speech against them. But we have allowed it to continue and have this exception to laws and norms. With the treaty, we wanted to push an agreement. We hope that it will help countries make other choices. We saw, for example, with the Land Mines Treaty, that the United States or Russia or China didn’t sign it, but they change their policies and behaviors. This treaty creates a norm that nuclear weapons are bad. In a time of so many profound worries, why should we prioritize nuclear disarmament? This is an issue that could be an easy fix. It could be quite easy to make decisions to just reduce them or take them off alert status and reprioritize our militaries. We could use that money for other things. We have the power to do it. People think nuclear weapons are like a natural disaster or an asteroid hitting Earth, because the consequences are so awful. But we need to see them as just weapons; we can control them. They’re just really giant, expensive, dirty bombs that could end us all. We built them; we can take them apart. Are there ways to change people’s minds about nuclear bombs? We have to keep talking about the humanitarian impacts of what would happen if you use them. We get a glimpse of it when we talk about North Korea, but we don’t think about how American nuclear weapons are aimed right now. They can be launched within 20 minutes. If the U.S. nuclear arsenal all went off, it could kill civilization, and Donald Trump has the ultimate authority to do that, as commander in chief. But if you’re really uncomfortable with Trump having that power, you are really uncomfortable with nuclear weapons in general. There are no right hands for these weapons. There’s no one who should have that kind of power.",2017-11-01T11:00:02.000+01:00,NYTIMES,magazine-magazine

Mario M. Cuomo in his effort to close the plant, officials on both sides of the issue said today. Supporters of nuclear power are mounting yet another effort in the Congress to save the Shoreham nuclear power plant, but the leadership of the House has intervened to help Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in his effort to close the plant, officials on both sides of the issue said today. Responding to an appeal from Mr. Cuomo and Long Island members of Congress, the House leadership yanked a piece of legislation from the House calendar this week because supporters of nuclear power were going to use the legislation as a vehicle for an amendment to prevent Shoreham from being dismantled. Officials on both sides of the issue said the amendment would probably have been approved, with Republicans and pro-nuclear Democrats joining forces to express their concern about the dismantling of a fully operational power plant. 'Borders on the Insane' ''Dismantling a ready-to-go $5.5 billion generator of 800 megawatts of clean electricity borders on the insane,'' said the amendment's sponsor, Representative Don Ritter, Republican of Pennsylvania. The amendment, which the Energy and Commerce Committee had approved on a 23-to-19 vote, would bar the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission from participating in the transfer of Shoreham's license or in dismantling the plant. That would effectively have blocked the plan that Governor Cuomo has worked out with the Long Island Lighting Company to transfer the plant to the state and then to decommission it. The amendment will still come to a vote. But members of the New York delegation said the plan now was to wait until after the August Congressional recess. By then, Lilco will be well along with the first steps in dismantling the plant and dispersing its staff, an official familiar with the situation said. Lilco has begun pulling the nuclear fuel rods from the plant core and is also begining to reduce the staff. It would take three years to reassemble the staff, an official familiar with the plant said. Republicans and pro-nuclear Democrats on Capitol Hill have been watching with increasing skepticism as Mr. Cuomo, who has been battling the Shoreham project for years, made a deal in which Lilco, stymied by opposition to the plant, agreed to sell the state the plant for $1 and a promise of a guaranteed future rate increase. Safety Risk The battle over Shoreham, which has dragged on for years, is seen by both sides as crucial to the future of nuclear power in the United States. Mr. Cuomo and many Long Island poliiticians have opposed the plant, saying it poses an unacceptable safety risk on crowded Long Island. But supporters of nuclear energy say a victory by Mr. Cuomo and other opponents of the plant would give localites the power to impose their judgment over the judgment of national energy experts. Mr. Ritter said his amendment was firmly supported by the Bush Administration, which over the weekend stepped up pressure to save the plant. The Administration is also studying legal action to block closing of the plant, which has been completed but has never gone into commercial operation. The amendment was to be attached to the legislation authorizing spending by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the next two fiscal years. The House Rules Committee, over the vehement objections of Representative George Hochbrueckner, a Long Island Democrat, voted last week to allow the amendment when the authorization bill came to the floor this week. Memo on Floor Action The House whip, William H. Gray 3d, a Pennsylvania Democrat, had already notified his colleagues in a memorandum that the bill was scheduled for floor action this week. But in response to telephone calls from Mr. Cuomo's office, Mr. Gray and the other House leaders pulled the bill from consideration. His spokesman, Jon Plebani, did not respond to requests for an explanation. Jeff Biggs, a spokesman for House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington, said the authorization bill had to take a back seat to the flood of appropriations bills the House is now taking up. Other lawmakers said the bill had been pulled to prevent Mr. Ritter's amendment from coming to a vote now. Mr. Ritter said he believed his amendment had a good chance of passing in the House, although others said its fate in the Senate was more problematic. A New Leadership ''There's a new Democratic leadership,'' Mr. Ritter said. ''Are they ready to take up the anti-nuclear movement banner so powerfully by keeping this off the floor?'' Brad Johnson, New York State's lobbyist in Washington, praised the House leadership. Mr. Johnson said that when Mr. Ritter's amendment appeared headed for a floor vote, he called several New York members of the House and asked them to intervene. ''They told the leadership this was a wacky amendment and unwise and controversial that doesn't deserve floor consideration when there are more pressing national issues,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''The Speaker concluded there are far more important issues for Congress to work on than debating a local power plant issue.''",1989-07-19T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

If the project goes forward, the reactors would be the first begun in the United States since the 1970s. The announcement of the loan guarantee  $8.3 billion to help the Southern Company and two partners build twin reactors in Burke County  comes as the administration is courting Republican support for its climate and energy policies. With climate legislation stalled in the Senate and its prospects for success dim, Democrats are seeking new incentives to spur clean energy development and create jobs. At the same time, the president’s embrace of nuclear energy has drawn the ire of environmental groups that have long opposed any return to a reliance on nuclear power. In his speech, Mr. Obama portrayed the decision as part of a broad strategy to increase employment and the generation of clean power. But he also made clear that the move was a bid to gain Republican support for a broader energy bill. “Those who have long advocated for nuclear power  including many Republicans  have to recognize that we will not achieve a big boost in nuclear capacity unless we also create a system of incentives to make clean energy profitable,” Mr. Obama said. Some Republicans, however, said that the announcement would have little effect on their votes. Don Stewart, a spokesman for the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, said that Mr. McConnell had repeatedly praised Mr. Obama for favoring additional loan guarantees for nuclear power plants. But, he said, this would not translate into support for a cap on carbon dioxide emissions. “It won’t cause Republicans to support the national energy tax,” Mr. Stewart said. He added that Republican and Democratic ideas on energy policy overlapped in some areas, but that much of Mr. Obama’s energy program did not fall into those areas. Robert Dillon, a spokesman for Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said that she thought nuclear power was “a core component of a comprehensive energy plan,” but that she would vote on an energy bill as a whole. “One or two provisions aren’t going to offset bad provisions,” he said. The announcement of the loan guarantees, which had been signaled in advance, drew immediate praise from the nuclear industry and criticism from some environmental groups. David M. Ratcliffe, the chairman and chief executive of the Southern Company, said that a nuclear renaissance was in the wings and that “we will get on with that at a more rapid pace now that we’ve made this first step.” Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, however, said that nuclear power was not the fastest or cheapest way to reduce the greenhouse gases linked to global warming. “The loan guarantees announced today may ease the politics around comprehensive clean energy and climate legislation, but we do not believe that they are the best policy,” he said. Despite the financing, the reactors are far from a done deal: their design has not yet been fully approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, whose staff has raised questions about whether changes made to harden the plant against aircraft attack had made it more vulnerable to earthquakes. The builders hope to have a license to build and run the plant by the end of next year, under a revised process that is supposed to eliminate problems that caused huge cost overruns in the 1970s and 1980s, when regulatory changes during construction added billions to costs. About 100 reactors were abandoned during construction in that era. The Southern Company applied two years ago to the commission for permission to build and operate the reactors, adjacent to its Vogtle 1 and 2 reactors. The loan guarantees were authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. If the reactors are built and operate profitably, the borrowers will repay the banks and pay a fee to the federal government in exchange for the guarantee; if the borrowers default, the federal government will repay the banks. Critics have argued that the chance of default is high, and the loans have been delayed by protracted negotiations over what the fee should be. The money for the reactors is the first award from $18.5 billion in loan guarantees provided for under the 2005 act. But Mr. Obama proposed this month to triple that amount. The guarantees can cover up to 80 percent of the estimated project cost, although some builders may ask for less. Southern asked for 70 percent, but the project may also be eligible for loan guarantees from the Japanese government; the reactors were designed by Westinghouse, a unit of Toshiba. The Energy Department is negotiating with potential borrowers for three other projects, two of which could win guarantees soon. The Scana Corporation and Santee Cooper want to build a nuclear plant near Jenkinsville, S.C., and UniStar is planning a reactor in southern Maryland, adjacent to the Calvert Cliffs reactors. A third project, in Texas, is in some doubt because of rising cost estimates and a lawsuit filed by the municipal utility serving San Antonio against its partner in the project, NRG of Princeton, N.J. The United States has 104 operating power reactors, but all the reactors ordered after 1973 were canceled.",2010-02-16T21:14:27.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

Russia's assistance in building a nuclear plant in the Iranian city of Bushehr, near the Persian Gulf, has been a nagging irritant in relations with the United States for years. It produced the sourest note in otherwise friendly meetings between President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin here in May. While administration officials have pressed Russia to break its contract to complete a 1,000-megawatt reactor at Bushehr, a document approved this week by Prime Minister Mikhail M. Kasyanov and announced today outlined plans to build three more reactors at the site. The document also indicated that Russia would offer to build two more reactors at a new nuclear power station at Ahwaz, a city about 60 miles from Iran's border with Iraq. That appeared to contradict remarks earlier this month by Russia's atomic energy minister, Aleksandr Y. Rumyantsev, who said the cooperation with Iran in developing its nuclear-power industry would end with the project at Bushehr. Russia, like Iran, has repeatedly dismissed the American concerns about the project, insisting that it was a purely civilian effort to develop new energy sources. But the Bush administration, which has labeled Iran part of an ''axis of evil'' along with Iraq and North Korea, fears that the Iranians will use Russian equipment and expertise to pursue a secret program to produce nuclear weapons that could threaten Europe and the United States. Russia's plans were released on the government's official Web site today, without public comment, as part of a draft outlining potential areas of economic, industrial and scientific cooperation with Iran over the next 10 years. The prospect of more Russian assistance is certain to provoke new warnings from the United States and may undercut the close relationship that has developed between Mr. Putin and Mr. Bush, especially since the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. In recent months Russian officials have sought to defuse the Bush administration's complaints, saying Russia would insist that Iran return the plutonium produced as a byproduct of nuclear power generation to prevent it from being used in weapons. After their meetings in May, Mr. Bush said Mr. Putin had assured him that Russia would press Iran to allow extensive international inspections of the plant. Iran has signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and has previously said it will cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which oversees the world's civilian nuclear power programs. In Washington, administration officials said Russian cooperation with Iran's nuclear energy program would be on the agenda next week when Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham leads an American delegation to Russia to discuss energy and nuclear proliferation issues. ''Our concerns with regards to Russian cooperation with Iran on the issue of Bushehr are well known,'' said Sean McCormack, a spokesman for the National Security Council. ''We have expressed them in public as well as in private directly to Russian President Putin. And we will continue to work with Russia on proliferation issues of concern.'' After today's announcement, the chairman of Parliament's foreign affairs committee, Dmitri O. Rogozin, said Russia's plans should not hurt relations with the United States since Moscow shared Washington's worries.

Goldstein, Staffan A. Qvist and Steven Pinker (Sunday Review, April 7): The writers’ enthusiasm for carbon-free electricity is laudable, but the fixation on nuclear power is misguided. To truly decarbonize the United States’ economy, we need to fully use renewable energy solutions, which are significantly safer and more cost-effective. The proof of the pudding is in actual United States deployment. In 2018, more than 19,000 megawatts of new wind and solar capacity were brought online, the equivalent of 19 nuclear plants. To put that in perspective, over the last 20 years, only one new nuclear reactor entered into service on our soil. As the writers note, nuclear is “ hugely expe nsive” to build. The price of renewable energy has dramatically declined as a result of technological innovation and growing economies of scale. In fact, wind and solar are now the cheapest sources of electricity in many parts of the country. With the benefit of enhanced transmission, storage and a modernized grid, renewable power is ideally suited to meet today’s climate challenges. We welcome the opportunity to fairly compete with all available technologies, nuclear included.

The Soviet space program uses small nuclear reactors aboard some of its most important space vehicles, while American spacecraft tend to generate electricity from the sun. WHERE does a satellite get the electricity it needs as it orbits the earth? The Soviet space program uses small nuclear reactors aboard some of its most important space vehicles, while American spacecraft tend to generate electricity from the sun. But that could change. Moscow's recent launching of new, more powerful orbiting reactors was good news to American scientists who have tried unsuccessfully for decades to prod the Government into relying on nuclear power in space. Concern about a ''reactor gap,'' they maintain, might convince Congress that the United States needs to catch up. Yet such cries are dismissed by opponents who say that an important reason that the Soviets depend on reactors is that they lack more advanced technologies. Moreover, the critics argue, the technology is dangerous. Other experts say that American hopes for space-based reactors go so far beyond Soviet achievements as to be wildly unrealistic. A panel of the National Research Council said last week that the high-power orbiting nuclear reactors under study by the Pentagon for the Star Wars anti-missile system could weigh as much as 3,205 tons, making them ''impractical from both cost and launch considerations.'' The space shuttle, the nation's most powerful launching vehicle, can lift payloads of only about 27 tons. The United States pioneered the use of nuclear reactors in space, launching one into orbit in 1965. Although it generated 600 watts of electricity for 43 days and demonstrated the technology's promise, space reactor work was scrapped in the early 1970's. ''No one could find a use for it,'' said Steven Aftergood, director of the Committee to Bridge the Gap, a Los-Angeles-based group that opposes the use of nuclear power in earth orbit. Using their expertise in electronics, American scientists were able to perfect solar power instead. Today the United States has no working nuclear reactors in space. Moscow entered the game late and then plodded ahead. Its first flight test was in 1967, and by the 1970's small reactors producing between one thousand and a few thousand watts were powering radar satellites. These are used to spy on American warships, which are of great concern to the Soviets. ''We have 15 aircraft-carrier battle groups and they have none,'' said John E. Pike, head of space policy for the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. The Soviet spy satellites are in a low orbit - about 150 miles up - so they can better detect ships with their relatively crude radar, experts say. They use reactors rather than arrays of solar cells, which would increase atmospheric drag on the spacecraft and shorten their already short lifetimes. Recently, Soviet scientists announced the launching of two satellites carrying nuclear reactors that generate 10,000 watts of electricity. Some American experts suggest that these are paving the way for a new generation of spy satellites with much stronger radar. Opponents of the technology say that the United States needs no reactors in earth orbit, even for such power-hungry uses as radar satellites. Mr. Pike noted that in December the American military launched its first operational radar satellite, code-named Lacrosse, into a 430-mile-high orbit. Though consuming between 10,000 and 20,000 watts of electricity, he said, it is powered by a huge array of advanced solar cells. ''The United States has more moxie than the Soviets when it comes to photovoltaics,'' Mr. Pike said. The Lacrosse satellite's advanced solar cells are thought to be so flexible, he added, that thousands of square feet of them can be stored in a huge roll like so much plastic food wrap. Then they can be unfurled when the satellite reaches orbit. $1.8 Billion Program But American backers of nuclear reactors in space say that huge power plants are needed to send manned missions to Mars and to power a space-based anti-missile system. The United States is developing a space reactor that in the mid-1990's is supposed to generate between 10,000 and 100,000 watts of electricity for various civilian and military missions. The program's estimated cost is $1.8 billion. Also planned are even bigger nuclear reactors producing millions of watts of electricity - much more power than can be produced by solar cells. Richard L. Verga, who is in charge of developing power sources for the Pentagon's Strategic Defense Initiative, told a recent meeting of scientists in Albuquerque that nuclear reactors were ''survivable, compact, lightweight and affordable,'' making them ''an ideal technology candidate'' to power space-based weapons. But that assessment was challenged last week by the panel of the National Research Council, which said that the reactors would be ''unacceptably large.'' One solution, the panel said, would be to keep the giant reactors on the ground and beam their power into space. Opponents of the technology would ban reactors in earth orbit, where the accidental reentry of radioactive debris could damage human health, and instead have any East-West race for space reactors focus on more distant uses like powering manned lunar bases, Mars missions or deep space probes. Representative George E. Brown, Jr., a California Democrat who is sponsoring such a ban, told the scientists' meeting in Albuquerque that the planet ''should not be enveloped with radioactive satellites or with orbiting battle stations.'' ''I shudder to think of the consequences of an accident,'' he said. IDEAS & TRENDS",1989-01-22T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,week-in-review

Two accidents within days at French nuclear installations have prompted new concern about this country's ambitious nuclear power program. French officials have temporarily shut down Europe's biggest plant making fuel for nuclear reactors, at Tricastin, as a result of an accident over the weekend. They also said they did not know why a dangerous chemical was leaking from France's fast-breeder reactor, the only such commercial reactor in Western Europe. On Sunday night the state-owned Atomic Energy Commissariat said it was halting uranium enrichment at the Tricastin enrichment plant near Pierrelatte for a week while it investigated a leak of mildly radioactive toxic gas discovered over the weekend. The leak injured seven workers. On Monday, Jean-Pierre Capron, head of the commissariat, said experts still had not determined the cause of a leak of coolant discovered more than a week ago at Superphenix, the world's biggest fast-breeder reactor, not far from the Tricastin plant. Toxic and Volatile Substances The gas that escaped from the Tricastin plant, as a result of a faulty valve, was uranium hexachloride. It is only mildly radioactive though highly toxic. Although the sodium leaking from the Superphenix fast breeder is not radioactive, it is dangerous because it explodes on contact with water. About 25 tons of the chemical have escaped from the reactor so far, but investigators have not been able to trace the source of the leak. The two accidents have reopened the debate over the safety of nuclear reactors in a country that gets 70 percent of its electricity from atomic power and where nuclear energy has aroused less political controversy than anywhere else in Europe. France's major Socialist trade union has joined environmental groups in calling for the Superphenix to be shut down while the leak is traced. But the Industry Minister, Alain Madelin, appealed for calm. ''We must not lose our nerve,'' he said. ''If the repairs justify shutting down the reactor, we shall do so.'' The safety question is also focusing attention on the poor economic performance of the Superphenix reactor, which creates new plutonium from the plutonium fuel it burns, offering the prospect of almost limitless energy. In an interview with Le Monde, Mr. Capron said that Superphenix's electricity costs almost twice as much to produce as power from a normal reactor. But he argued that the cost could be reduced as French technicians learned more about designing and building fast breeders. ---- HIGH RADIATION LEVELS REPORTED BONN, April 14 (AP) - Several Western European countries reported today that they detected higher levels of radiation than usual last month. Some experts said the increase might have been caused by a nuclear power plant accident in the Soviet Union, but others discounted such a theory. West Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Norway and France confirmed varying increases in atmospheric radiation between March 9 and 15. The Soviet Union denied it was the source of the emissions, which officials said caused no damage or injuries. ''The experts are all saying it was almost certainly a nuclear power accident,'' said Heinz-Jorg Haury, a spokesman for the Government-financed Institute for Radioactivity and Environmental Research in Munich. But Tommy Godaas, chief inspector of the Swedish National Radiation Protection Agency, said the radiation could have been released in the burning of radioactive isotopes used for medical purposes or in cleaning the reactors. ''Considering the small amounts, an accidental minor reactor leak was possible, but it might as well have been a deliberately increased emission while cleaning a reactor,'' he said. The Russians denied last month that they were responsible for the increased emissions, and the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennadi I. Gerasimov, said today that the Soviet Union's radiation detection equipment is ''functioning well and no discharges of radioactive emissions have been registered.''",1987-04-15T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

But the main reason they spent so much time looking was Robert D. Pollard. Mr. Pollard is the senior nuclear safety engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit organization that worries about nuclear power and nuclear war. The group, which has offices in Boston and Washington, petitioned the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in June for an immediate shutdown of the 31-year-old plant. Mr. Pollard's complaint: the plant's critical steel parts were known to be brittle from age but the owners had not conducted the analysis required by N.R.C. regulations to see just how brittle. More than anyone else outside the N.R.C., Mr. Pollard has goaded regulators into writing new rules, performing inspections and making other changes at power plants, usually by petitioning a skeptical N.R.C. that its regulations were not being met. Mr. Pollard, who is 51, should know. After a six-year tour in the nuclear Navy and four years at Syracuse University to earn a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, he was hired in 1969 by the Atomic Energy Commission, the N.R.C.'s predecessor agency. By 1974 he was coordinating design and safety reviews for seven plants. He left to join the Union of Concerned Scientists in 1976. The group asserts that it does not oppose nuclear power per se, only unsafe reactors. But the utility industry sees Mr. Pollard as its most technically adept opponent, one whose work has caused toil and tribulation for reactor owners. Yet Mr. Pollard, who works out of a drab and crowded office in an unfashionable Washington neighborhood, remains largely pessimistic about the prospects for enforcing safety rules. ""It's nice to see cause and effect,"" he said of the Rowe shutdown.

West German and Swedish officials said Soviet officials had asked for help in controlling a burning nuclear reactor. The nuclear accident, described by Swedish experts as potentially the worst ever at a power plant, sent a radioactive cloud across parts of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and Scandinavia. Moscow provided few details, but intelligence sources believe that the accident occurred last Thursday or Friday and that radiation was continuing to spew yesterday. Western experts say they believe graphite used to moderate the nuclear reaction in the plant caught fire. They disagree on whether the fire was associated with a meltdown, in which nuclear fuel rods burn out of control. The Health Damage The Russians reported that four nearby localities had been evacuated, two people had died and others had been treated. Western experts say they fear that a great many more, perhaps thousands, who lived near the plant may become ill or die from radiation poisoning in coming years or suffer cancers and genetic mutations later. So far, radiation levels reaching Scandinavia are not considered dangerous. Could It Happen Here? American commercial reactors use water rather than graphite, a flammable material, to moderate nuclear reactions. They also, unlike the Soviet reactor in the accident, have steel and concrete containment structures designed to prevent the escape of radiation. But experts say they do not have enough information to tell whether the accident holds any lessons for nuclear power safety here. Unanswered Questions These are among the unanswered questions: When did the accident begin? What caused the accident? How much radiation of what types has been released? How many people have been killed, injured or exposed to dangerous radiation? Have soils, crops, water and livestock in the Ukraine been dangerously contaminated?",1986-04-30T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world

Yet there are two other, quite practical reasons for increased reliance on nuclear energy: the alarming rise in our use of imported oil, including the increasing consumption of foreign oil in generating electricity, and the potential shortfall in the early 1990's in the new generating capacity required to meet our growing electricity needs. The 1973 oil embargo shocked us, among other things, into reducing our dependence on foreign oil for electric power generation. In little more than a decade, new coal-fired and nuclear power plants helped shrink oil-fired electricity production from 16 percent of our total to 5 percent (and nuclear power's share rose from 5 percent to nearly 20 percent). However, for about the last 10 years, electric utilities have been so whiplashed with erratic regulation and punitive rate disallowances that they find it risky to undertake construction of new base-load power plants, including nuclear electric-generating plants. As a result, imported oil is increasingly filling the gap - 32 percent more of it was consumed by utilities in the first nine months of 1989 than in the comparable period just two years ago. As for electricity demand, we must insure that nuclear energy plays a substantial role in the years to come, for all the compelling reasons you cite, plus the fact that it has proven itself a safe, cost-effective energy source, with steadily improving performance.

A crowd of protesters shouted at him as he arrived on Monday at the government press center to make the announcement. “It’s a debate that traditionally makes strong political waves in Germany, that a lot of emotion is attached to,” Mr. Habeck said. “It has occupied the republic for a long time and is now about to occupy the republic again. My task in this situation is to get clear of it. We have to make the right decision as a government and I have to make the right decision as the minister responsible for supply security in Germany.” For weeks, Mr. Habeck and Chancellor Olaf Scholz resisted the push to keep nuclear plants on line, but finally agreed they would make their final decision based on the stress tests. If the results showed scenarios where nuclear power would help ease the crisis, they agreed to keep the plants on past the shutdown date. On Monday, the tests results said that while crisis situations in the power grid were “unlikely in winter 22/23, they cannot be completely ruled out.” The energy ministry said that starting in January 2023, the reactors should be relied on only in emergency conditions. Drought across Europe and nuclear power shortages in France this summer were a stark reminder of how unpredictable the risks can be.

Severe Europe-wide drought brought water levels of the Rhine River in Germany so low that the country was unable to ship as much coal on barges to fire the coal plants that have been restarted as an alternative to gas.",2022-09-06T04:19:01.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

The remarks by the leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, did not represent any change in Iran’s official position, but were unusual because he said them publicly, just a few days before the major world powers were expected to offer Iran new incentives to suspend its uranium enrichment program. Ayatollah Khamenei’s remarks seemed clearly aimed at those powers, including the United States, that contend that Iran covets nuclear weapons and may secretly be trying to develop the technology to build them. Mr. Khamenei called those accusations false, saying they were meant to deprive Iran of its legitimate right to nuclear power. “The Iranian nation is not seeking nuclear weapons,” the ayatollah said at an event commemorating the 19th anniversary of the death of the founder of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. “We are seeking nuclear energy for peaceful purposes for daily use, and we will continue this path to the envy of our enemies,” he said. “You know the Iranian nation is in principle and on religious grounds against the nuclear weapon. Nuclear weapons only incur high costs and have no use. They do not bring power to a nation,” he said. The ayatollah spoke a day after the State Department said it expected Javier Solana, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, to travel to Iran in mid-June to offer a package of new inducements if it abandoned uranium enrichment, which can be used to produce both electric power and nuclear weapons. Iran has consistently rejected demands that it stop enriching uranium, despite economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council. Ayatollah Khamenei’s speech also appeared to be a response to comments by the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, who said Monday in an unusually tough speech that Iran was holding back information needed to clarify intelligence reports that it had researched nuclear bombs in secret. The agency is the United Nations’ nuclear monitor. In what appeared to be a warning, the ayatollah said that terrorists could one day acquire nuclear bombs, leading to insecurity around the world.",2008-06-04T08:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-middle-east

The two reactors at the Sendai power plant on the southern island of Kyushu are the first to be certified as safe enough to restart by the Nuclear Regulation Authority since the agency was created two years ago to restore public confidence in nuclear oversight. All of Japan’s 48 operable commercial nuclear reactors were shut down after the March 2011 triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station created serious public doubts about the safety of atomic power in earthquake-prone Japan. Even with the approval, it will probably be months before either of the reactors can be turned back on. In addition to further safety checks, the plant’s operator, the Kyushu Electric Power Company, must obtain the consent of local governments around the plant. The final decision on whether to restart the plant will be made by the prime minister, probably in December, according to local news media reports. The approval follows intense political pressure on the new agency by the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , who supports big business and wants to restore atomic energy as part of his strategy to revive the nation’s long-anemic economy. He also wants to end Japan’s ballooning trade deficits, which many here attribute to the rising cost of imported fuel to make up for the loss of nuclear-generated electricity. However, opinion polls have shown that the public remains skeptical about both the safety of the plants and the ability of Mr. Abe’s governing Liberal Democratic Party to ensure that safety, as the party has long had close ties to the politically powerful nuclear industry. Those doubts were aired last month during a monthlong public comment period after the Nuclear Regulation Authority released a draft report in July that expressed approval of the Sendai plant’s safety measures. The agency said it had received 17,800 comments, more than it expected. Many were highly skeptical about the safety of the Sendai plant, which is in a volcanically active area. Still, the agency on Wednesday ended up adopting its July findings without major modifications. The agency said it made the decision after reviewing 18,600 pages of supporting documents filed by Kyushu Electric, as well as the results of its own inspections of the plant. It said the design and construction of the reactors and other facilities, and also the contingency plans for dealing with emergencies, met new safety standards that the agency adopted in July of last year. “I think the huge number of public comments, more than anything, reflects the enormous sensitivity toward the restart question, and the safety of nuclear power,” Kenzo Oshima, a commissioner at the agency, told reporters. “I also see it as reflecting a strong desire after the Fukushima accident to learn from that experience and raise the level of safety.” Agency officials have sought to reassure the public by calling the new safety standards the most stringent in the world, saying they fully incorporate the lessons of the Fukushima disaster, which happened when an earthquake and tsunami knocked out vital cooling systems at the Fukushima plant. Opponents of the restart said the agency was ignoring the concerns raised in the public comments. They said the agency, which had started amid high hopes for more independent oversight, was looking more and more like a rubber stamp for the administration. “There was clearly huge pressure on the regulatory agency from the Abe government,” said Akira Kimura, a professor of peace studies at Kagoshima University who has been involved in efforts to block the restart of the Sendai plant. “This government is just ramming through its agenda, with complete disregard for the public will.”",2014-09-10T16:54:16.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Donald Mazur says he did not know which mountain to climb first in 1983 after the Washington Public Power Supply System, of which he is managing director, defaulted on $2.25 billion in bonds on two canceled nuclear plants. The litigation looked insurmountable, he needed to finish work on the trouble-plagued unit 2 and Congress was considering a tax law that made it impossible to refinance $2.8 billion in bonds on two other plants. Things are better now. His flagship unit 2 is producing power. A trial over the default ended in a $750 million settlement earlier this year. And the Tax Corrections Act made it possible for him to sell, possibly by Thursday, $450 million in bonds as a first refinancing issue on units 1 and 3. Mr. Mazur said work halted on units 1 and 3 because power was not needed. Now a drought has caused utilities to purchase power from Canada this summer and electricity to aluminum plants could be slashed by 50 percent this winter if the short-term picture does not improve. The 55-year-old engineer cautioned in a telephone interview that ''there is no precipitous need to jump into a nuclear construction program because a major plant may not be needed until the year 2000.'' ''But we didn't just drop the wrench and walk away,'' he added. ''We have a good preservation program and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sees no problem for extending licenses.'' The bond default led to a nuclear backlash in the Pacific Northwest, and many question whether the plants ever will be built. Matt Dillon, a commissioner with the Snohomish County Public Utility District, which is a shareholder in the power system, has opposed a construction resumption. He said that ''I don't believe that either plant will be needed or are cost effective compared to other options, like conservation.'' Mr. Mazur disagrees, saying the completion cost would be .3 billion a plant or 3.3 cents a kilowatt hour, ''and a coal plant couldn't even touch that cost.'' Mr. Mazur received a mechanical engineering degree from the Lawrence Institute of Technology in 1958 and worked through 1977 for the Department of Energy in various positions. He went to the power system in 1980 as program director for units 1 and 4 and was named managing director in 1983.

Ukraine does not seek to hinder or prevent prospects for peace, which can result from dismantling nuclear weapons and reducing nuclear stockpiles. Having suffered, and still suffering, the horrors of Chernobyl, Ukrainians are acutely sensitive to the destruction wrought by nuclear power and in no way aspire to maintain Ukraine's status as the world's third most powerful nuclear country. Contrary to some Western opinion, Ukraine's hesitation on dismantling its nuclear arsenal does not mask a grand aspiration for power, but rather reflects concern over preserving its newly independent status. For centuries, Ukraine was dominated by Russia. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia has made progress toward improving its relations with the West and its neighbors, and redefining its place in the world. Ukraine's democrats warmly welcome this change. However, many strong, chauvinist factions still exist in Russia, and stability there is far from guaranteed. The possibility still exists for an imperialist or extreme nationalist regime to take power in Russia and set its sights on recovering former Soviet territories, such as Ukraine. Ukraine must seek concrete and precise security guarantees from other nuclear powers to protect the integrity of its internationally recognized territory before transferring all its nuclear weapons to its more powerful, still unstable neighbor, Russia.

85564c3e-7be6-4084-b794-b07d4eb61dfd,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/business/britain-revives-regulation-in-a-push-for-renewable-energy.html,Britain Revives Regulation in a Push for Renewable Energy,"LONDON — The British government announced on Friday far-reaching changes in energy regulation intended to encourage development of renewable energy and nuclear power while ensuring that the country can still meet its electricity needs. The changes will gradually quadruple the charges levied on consumers and businesses to help support electricity generation from low-carbon sources, to a total of about £9.8 billion, or $15.7 billion, in the 2020-21 fiscal year, from £2.35 billion now. The government forecasts that the new price supports will add 7 percent, or about £95 a year, to the average household electricity bill. Such charges add 2 percent to energy bills, or £20 a year. The effort shows that Britain, despite an ailing economy, is sticking to the ambitious goals for renewable energy and emissions reductions set in 2008 under the Labour government of Gordon Brown. Britain is also shifting its approach toward energy. In the 1990s, Britain led Europe in deregulation of its energy markets. Now it is returning to a system of greater market intervention to fulfill what the government considers to be an imperative to reduce greenhouse gases. Electricity generated from cleaner sources like nuclear and offshore wind is much more expensive than power generated by coal- or gas-fired plants. Companies will invest in clean energy only if given substantial incentives. The government hopes to attract £110 billion in energy investment through 2020. The proposed regulatory changes will be incorporated in an energy bill that is to be approved next year, with the new rules phased in starting in 2014. “In the 1990s there was a real move to make the U.K. power market a kind of liberalized, supply-demand, price-driven market,” said Howard V. Rogers, director of the gas program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, a research group. “As soon as you introduce subsidies for wind, you undermine that principle.” The proposed changes come after months of debate within the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. The Liberal Democrats favor tough goals to reduce emissions. The Conservatives, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, lean more toward promoting the use of natural gas. They also worry that wind farms will spoil the countryside, where many Conservative voters reside. The government proposal “will allow us to meet our legally binding carbon reduction and renewable energy obligations and bring on the investment required to keep the lights on and bills affordable for consumers,” Edward Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, said in a statement. Mr. Davey added that the proportion of electricity coming from renewable sources would increase to 30 percent by 2020, from 11 percent today. Businesses are likely to welcome the bill because, if nothing else, it reduces the uncertainty that has made big investment decisions difficult. “This package will send a strong signal to investors that the government is serious about providing firms with the certainty they need to invest in affordable, secure, low-carbon energy,” John Cridland, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, the country’s main business group, said in a statement. The renewable energy industry said it would welcome increased government support. “This is a crucial announcement for the renewable energy sector,” said Maria McCaffery, chief executive of RenewableUK, a trade association. “This blows the last few months of political infighting completely out of the water.” Some environmental groups, however, said that the government should set stricter emission targets for power companies. “By failing to agree to any carbon target for the power sector until after the next election, David Cameron has allowed a militant tendency within his own ranks to derail the energy bill,” John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, said in a statement. “It’s a blatant assault on the greening of the U.K. economy that leaves consumers vulnerable to rising gas prices, and sends billions of pounds of clean-tech investment to our economic rivals.” Others said they were appalled by support for new nuclear installations. While nuclear plants are low carbon emitters, they bring risks of accidents as well as the unresolved problem of what to do with spent fuel. Stephan Singer, head of energy policy in Brussels for the World Wildlife Fund, said his organization was “fundamentally opposed” to price supports for nuclear power. With energy costs already a major source of complaint, consumers are unlikely to be happy with the government plan. “These higher energy costs are likely to hit low-income consumers hard,” said Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch.com, which sells consumers electricity online at favorable rates. Britain intends to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 compared with 1990 levels. Until now, wind power has been the main beneficiary of government intervention. Now the government has come to believe that while building more nuclear plants would be costly and contentious, they will be necessary to reach emission targets. At present there is likely to be only one new plant in operation by 2020, said Kirsty Alexander, a spokeswoman for the Nuclear Industry Association, a trade group. Additional government support is likely to benefit EDF, the utility that owns most of the nuclear plants in Britain. EDF, with the British utility Centrica as a partner, wants to build a series of new reactors, starting with two at Hinkley Point in Somerset in southwest England. “We recognize the government’s continued commitment to deliver the timetable for electricity market reform, including legally robust arrangements for much-needed projects during the transition,” Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy, said in a statement. “This is good news and a significant step toward providing secure, low-carbon energy for the U.K. for many years to come.” About 18 percent of Britain’s power comes from nuclear sources, but that figure may decline. The last nuclear plant to open in Britain was Sizewell B in 1995, and several nuclear plants are scheduled to shut down in the next few years. The government has identified eight sites suitable for new reactors, all at the sites of existing power plants. The government said it would promote development of nuclear and wind power through a new mechanism called a contract for difference. Under the program, a new government-owned entity would guarantee companies that produce power from nuclear or wind a certain price for the electricity they produce. The companies will be compensated if actual prices fall below that “strike price.” “It will manage the payments under the contract,” said Fiona Reilly, head of the nuclear services practice at Norton Rose, a London law firm. “That might mean paying money to generators and it might mean taking money from generators if power prices are higher than the strike price.” EDF’s decision to go ahead at Hinkley Point still depends on where the government sets that strike price. The opinion among utility companies is that it will need to be at least £100 per megawatt hour, roughly double the current price of electricity. Another open question is whether Britain would violate European Union rules on state aid by supporting nuclear power, a mature technology. Britain “is heading for trouble with the E.U.,” said Mr. Singer of the World Wildlife Fund. “State aid regulations rule out any support for mature technologies.” Nick Turton, a spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change, said the government was working with Brussels to ensure that Britain conformed to European rules.",2012-11-24T01:16:08.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day

Europe moved with startling speed to wean itself off Russian oil and natural gas in the wake of war in Ukraine. But breaking the longstanding dependency on Russia’s vast nuclear industry is a much more complicated undertaking. Russia, through its mammoth state-owned nuclear power company, Rosatom, dominates the global nuclear supply chain. It was Europe’s third-largest supplier of uranium in 2021, accounting for 20 percent of the total. With few ready alternatives, there has been scant support for sanctions against Rosatom — despite urging from the Ukrainian government in Kyiv. For countries with Russian-made reactors, reliance runs deep. In five European Union countries, every reactor — 18 in total — were built by Russia. In addition, two more are scheduled to start operating soon in Slovakia, and two are under construction in Hungary, cementing partnerships with Rosatom far into the future.",2023-03-10T06:00:12.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

But despite the global anxiety created by the Soviet accident, experts say that it has not caused major technical changes in the nuclear power industry of the West. In the year since the Chernobyl disaster, nuclear power has undergone its most critical appraisal since the invention of the reactor in 1942. But despite the global anxiety created by the Soviet accident, experts say that it has not caused major technical changes in the nuclear power industry of the West. But industry supporters and critics also agree that the accident of April 26, 1986, forced new attention to the human factor in nuclear safety. Western scientists say that inadequate technical design gave the Chernobyl accident a year ago its particular shape, but that faulty human decisions - stressed in Soviet accounts - actually caused it. Technical Lessons for Soviet Spokesmen for the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the industry said in interviews that the technical lessons of the accident applied almost exclusively to the Soviet Union. An accident of the Chernobyl kind in United States is precluded by differences in design, they say, including the requirement that commercial reactors have containment domes. Nevertheless, the Chernobyl experience has prompted renewed scrutiny of the adequacy of containment shells, which are intended to prevent the emission of radioactive materials in case of an accident. The Chernobyl reactor lacked such a shell. Groups opposing nuclear power contend that the industry in the United States is resistant to costly changes. Some critics say that Chernobyl stands as an indictment of nuclear power in general and that it should be phased out altogether. The Chernobyl explosion and fire, which began as a result of a series of human errors, has taken 31 lives by the Soviet Government's account. An untold number of people in the Soviet Union and in the rest of Europe were exposed to somewhat elevated cancer risks from fallout, and 135,000 residents of the Chernobyl area of the Ukraine were evacuated from their homes for an indefinite period. Antinuclear groups in Scandinavia, West Germany and other countries appear to have gained new political strength, slowing the expansion of nuclear power at least temporarily. In the United States, fears inspired by Chernobyl have been cited as factors in the continuing deadlock over opening reactors in New Hampshire and New York. But despite the mounting political and legal efforts of opponents, the nuclear power industry has had a productive year in the United States. Although no new reactors have been ordered since 1978, previously ordered generating units have been coming on line, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensed them in 1986 at an average rate of one every seven weeks, bringing the total to 107. Last year, an industry spokesman said, nuclear reactors in the United States provided 16.6 percent of the electricity generated, and nuclear power production reached 414 billion kilowatt-hours, up 7.9 percent from 1985. #70% of French Electricity Although the United States, with one-fourth of the world's nuclear-generated electricity, accounts by far for the largest world share, other countries derive a greater part of their national electricity output from nuclear reactors. In France, it is 70 percent, and in Japan, 25 percent. Among the American experts who have examined the implications of Chernobyl is Harold R. Denton, the director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Mr. Denton, who this month moved to a new job coordinating governmental and public affairs programs for the commission, visited the Chernobyl plant last month with a group from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy. ''There is no direct nexus that can be drawn between their reactors and ours at a technical level,'' he said in an interview. ''I would say that it is correct that a Chernobyl-type accident is precluded in the United States because of design differences, although, of course, that does not rule out accidents of other types. I would also say that Soviet managers have apparently been learning from the mistakes of Chernobyl, as ours did from the Three Mile Island accident in 1979.'' 'Little Technical Impact' A report on the Chernobyl disaster issued this month by the Atomic Industrial Forum, an American industry group, said: ''The Soviet accident has had little technical impact on civilian nuclear technology in the West. After a year of intensive analysis, Government and industry experts are convinced the Soviet design is not relevant to Western nuclear programs, because the design of the Chernobyl-type reactor is unique.'' Nevertheless, American reactors have had their share of problems. A scandal came to light March 31 when the Peach Bottom station at Delta, Pa., was closed after Federal inspectors found evidence that operators had been sleeping at the controls. That incident and other lapses in discipline underscore a contention by Mr. Denton and others that the most serious problems involve human behavior. In this respect, they acknowledge, the kind of mismanagement that caused the Chernobyl disaster could occur in the United States as well. Operating errors played an important role at Three Mile Island, experts say, and that accident had a greater impact on the American industry than did Chernobyl. A Review of Safety No one was killed or injured at Three Mile Island and the reactor's containment shell prevented the escape of significant amounts of radioactive debris. But the accident led to charges that nuclear power was unsafe, and all aspects of reactor safety were reviewed as a result. Virtually all American commercial reactors are light-water reactors, of a type in which ordinary water serves both to carry useful heat away from the reactor and to moderate, or slow down, neutrons produced by the nuclear reaction, thereby using them to maintain a controlled chain reaction. By contrast, the graphite-moderated type of reactor at Chernobyl and some other Soviet stations uses water to carry away heat, but moderates neutrons by a gigantic honeycomb of graphite, in which the uranium-bearing fuel rods and their water jackets are embedded. A critical difference between the two types is that the graphite reactor embodies an engineering concept called positive void coefficient. The effect of this feature is that if the amount of steam in the reactor core increases, the power of the reactor also increases, and this leads to the production of more steam. When such a reactor is operated at low power, in what is called an unstable mode, it can easily be tripped into a runaway reaction of the kind that brought about last year's disaster. In an experiment that led to the accident, the Chernobyl operators had deliberately throttled the reactor back. Stability and Safeguards Industry spokesmen say American reactors are intrinsically more stable and have faster-acting emergency shutdown systems. Moreover, American reactors have control and safety systems that are strictly separated, and reactors are safeguarded against the release of radioactive material by containment domes. An exception is the N Reactor at the Hanford Engineering Works near Richland, Wash., which is used to make fissionable material for weapons. It was closed for renovation on Dec. 12 after it was declared unsafe. The Union of Concerned Scientists, a Washington-based political action group, contends that American reactors present many of the same hazards as Soviet reactors. Robert D. Pollard, a spokesman, said in an interview that containment shells to not provide adequate protection. The Containment Dome Question James Joosten, an official of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said at a recent conference in Britain that the Chernobyl accident ''should stimulate a general re-examination of containment philosophy.'' In the United States, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is considering proposals to strengthen containment structures around some older reactors. However, the agency does not consider itself guided by the Chernobyl experience. Mr. Denton, after inspecting Chernobyl, said the Soviet reactor ''just had some compartments contained.'' ''They did not have what I would call the Western-style full-envelope containment,'' he added. One approach to reducing the possibility of accidents, he said, may be the development of new interactive computer programs that will serve as watchdogs against human error. ''Such automation would mean that as long as a plant operator performed in ways the computer was programmed to regard as acceptable, the computer would not interfere,'' Mr. Denton said. ''But if the computer detected what it considered a mistake it would warn the operator, perhaps forcing the operator to call in a supervisor to rule on the action.'' Meanwhile, Mr. Denton said, regulatory officials continue to look for ways for improving instrumentation, operator procedures and containment systems of existing reactors.

Connecticut Yankee is the oldest operating full-scale commercial nuclear power plant in the nation, but it has been shut down since July 22 for safety reasons, along with the three Millstone reactors in Waterford, Conn., leaving the state with no operating reactors. Anthony E. Nericcio, a spokesman for the Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company, the consortium of eight utilities that own Connecticut Yankee, said the final decision to decommission the plant will not be made for at least a month, but that the likelihood that the 582-megawatt reactor would not be shut down was ''very slim.'' The plant's fate highlights not only the increased scrutiny of nuclear plants in Connecticut, but also the fact that nuclear power has become relatively expensive compared with other fuels, like oil and gas. Mr. Nericcio said the decommissioning would probably take at least two years. He added that the 350 employees there had been told that they would continue to have jobs for at least another six months. After that, they face several possibilities: they might continue to work during the shutdown, they might be terminated, they might be offered buyouts, or they could be transferred to the Millstone plants or the Seabrook nuclear power plant in Seabrook, N.H. Those plants are either owned outright by Northeast Utilities, of Berlin, Conn., the largest member of the consortium that owns Connecticut Yankee, or by other consortiums that include Northeast Utilities. He also said that employees working on a contractual basis at the plant would be let go soon. ''It was received quietly,'' he said, when asked about the response from employees at the plant. ''It was a surprise.'' Mr. Nericcio stressed that the decision to shut down the reactor, which sits hard by the Connecticut River in the eastern part of the state, was based on economic factors and was not tied to the safety concerns that have recently dogged the plant. Simply put, prices of natural gas and oil have fallen so low and remained low for so long that nuclear power is no longer a comparatively cheap source of energy. ''Oil is cheaper than bottled water,'' said Charles Komanoff, an energy economist in Manhattan who has long followed the nuclear industry. Bruce D. Kenyon, president and chief executive of Connecticut Yankee, said in a statement released yesterday: ''The owners of Connecticut Yankee have done an analysis of the economics involved in running this plant for the next 10 years. At this point, the economic picture does not seem favorable.'' To a degree, though, the economics of operating Connecticut Yankee have hinged on increased costs stemming from shutdowns and increased regulatory scrutiny. Much, but not all of that scrutiny, has been sparked not by safety problems at the Haddam plant but by concerns about the Millstone reactors, which have a spottier safety record. Connecticut Yankee was licensed to operate until 2007. It began operations on Jan. 1, 1968, the same day as the San Onofre reactor in Southern California, which was shut down for similar economic reasons in 1990; the two reactors were the first full-scale commercial nuclear reactors to operate in the nation. Since San Onofre's shutdown, a handful of other reactors have been shut down because they were not cost-effective. ''This is a surprise because Connecticut Yankee represented the best of the nuclear power industry for its first two decades,'' Mr. Komanoff said. A shutdown of Connecticut Yankee is not expected to have much effect on electricity rates for any of the companies that own part of the plant. Besides Northeast Utilities, the owners include the New England Power Company, the United Illuminating Power Company, the Boston Edison Company, the Central Maine Power Company, the Montauk Electric Company, the Cambridge Electric Company and the Central Vermont Public Service Corporation. ''The costs of decommissioning are expected to be offset by being able to buy cheaper energy,'' Mr. Nericcio said. Mr. Kenyon, in his statement, said that the decision to shut the plant stemmed from meetings in September of representatives of the utilities in the consortium. The owners analyzed the costs associated with operating and maintaining the plant, and compared those with the cost of purchasing replacement power. Under many of the scenarios evaluated, Mr. Kenyon said, continuing to run the plant would have saddled the operators with extra costs that ranged from tens of millions of dollars to $100 million, depending on assumptions made about plant operations, expenses and the cost of replacement power. Moreover, he added that since the last economic analysis, projected fuel costs have dropped even further, while the rate of growth in demand for power has slowed in New England and more efficient technologies are being developed. ''Regardless of the outcome, Connecticut Yankee employees should be proud of the contribution they have made and service they have provided to the people and businesses of New England.''",1996-10-10T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

In each case, China’s leadership has promised safety reviews in response to a public outcry. But the reviews have been structured in a way that makes them unlikely to slow down high-priority infrastructure projects. That was underlined on Wednesday and Thursday by separate, and possibly coincidental, announcements on safety for high-speed rail and for nuclear power plants. The government announced a broad safety review of high-speed rail late on Wednesday, with nearly identical parameters to the nuclear safety review that it started in March. Hours later, a government-controlled nuclear trade group said that the nuclear safety review had been successfully completed, and it praised the safety of the existing plants and those under construction. The Chinese cabinet, known as the State Council, said Wednesday that it was suspending the approval of new rail lines until the safety review could be completed. The state-controlled media covered that decision heavily. Less prominently reported, though, was another aspect of the cabinet announcement, saying that work could continue on previously approved projects while their safety was reviewed. Industry experts say that the Rail Ministry has a backlog of three to four years on rail lines previously approved and not yet built. The council announced a very similar approach to nuclear plants five days after the Japanese tsunami, halting new approvals but not work on projects already under way. The state media treated the news the same way, emphasizing the halt, while the five-year backlog of approved projects meant that the halt would have little practical effect. Unlike regulators in the West, Chinese regulators allow power companies to do a lot of construction at nuclear power plants while waiting for official approval of the project. At a nuclear power plant project in Shandong Province , Huaneng Group, China’s largest electric utility, built the foundations, administration buildings and other structures many months before receiving permission to build the reactor itself. That permission came, coincidentally, just two weeks before the Japanese earthquake. The China Nuclear Energy Association , a trade group under tight government supervision, announced on Thursday that the government had “completed its national inspection of all nuclear plants in operation and those under construction.” Michael Friedlander, a longtime nuclear power specialist based in Hong Kong, said the nuclear safety review had served its purpose by allaying public concerns at the time of the tsunami. “You couldn’t say you weren’t going to do anything,” Mr. Friedlander said. “There’s such demand in China for energy, and nuclear power has such a central role in their plans that nothing is going to get in the way of it.” In another example of the government’s efforts to appear active on safety issues, without necessarily making substantive changes, the State Council announced late Wednesday that it would reduce the top speed of high-speed trains to 300 kilometers per hour, or 186 miles per hour, from 350 kilometers per hour, or 217 miles per hour. But the rail ministry had actually announced last spring that it was reducing the top speed to 300 kilometers per hour, in response to a corruption scandal then in which safety questions were raised. In an e-mail response to questions on June 3, the rail ministry said that not only had the planned speed for the Beijing to Shanghai route been reduced to 300 kilometers per hour for its opening on July 1, but that trains on existing routes, such as Guangzhou to Wuhan, would also be slowed to 300 kilometers per hour as of July 1. In a separate development, one of China’s bullet train manufacturers, the CNR Corporation, announced Friday that it was recalling 54 of its trains from the Beijing to Shanghai route to test sensors that may be causing the trains to stop unnecessarily, such as when a passenger lights a cigarette in a restroom. The rail ministry announced separately Thursday that the number of high-speed trains each day between Beijing and Shanghai would be reduced to 66 in each direction starting next Tuesday, from 88 in each direction now. Slower speeds reduce the number of trains that can use the route, though the new schedule still allows for several departures each hour in each direction.",2011-08-11T14:55:19.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

President Reagan today issued an executive order that gives the Federal Government broad new authority to draft emergency evacuation plans for communities near nuclear power plants. The move was apparently aimed at breaking fierce local opposition to operations at the Long Island Lighting Company's idle Shoreham nuclear reactor and at a second troubled plant in Seabrook, N.H. Opponents and some supporters of the plants agreed that the President's action could pave the way for full operations at both. New Agency Powers Like all commercial reactors, those at Seabrook and Shoreham are barred from operating without a license granted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Until now, state and local governments' participation in the development of required evacuation plans has been a customary part of the licensing process. Under Mr. Reagan's order, the Federal Emergency Management Agency could assume that role if the state or the locality involved, opposing operation of such a plant, refused to participate. The order requires the agency to adopt interim rules within 90 days to carry it out. After an additional 90 days, for public comment, the rules become final. 'Important Step Forward' Secretary of Energy John S. Herrington, in a statement late today, called the order ''an important step forward in the process of licensing Shoreham and other nuclear power plants.'' Officials of the nuclear power industry minimized the order's impact. They noted that last year the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in response to local opposition at Shoreham, adopted a rule giving utility companies the power to prepare their own evacuation plans for commission approval if state and municipal officials refused to do so. But today's action was clearly significant, in part because it would throw the weight of Federal resources like hospitals and disaster control personnel behind such a plan, enhancing the likelihood of commission approval. In his four-page executive order, the President gave the Federal Emergency Management Agency the power to draft the evacuation plans whenever state or local governments ''decline or fail to prepare'' plans on their own. Should an accident occur at a nuclear power plant, the order said, the agency ''shall assume any necessary command-and-control function, or delegate such function to another Federal agency, in the event that no competent state and local authority is available to perform such function.'' No Fanfare in Issuance The order was issued without fanfare early this evening. Handled like a routine press release, it was accompanied by no briefing for reporters and came at the beginning of a weekend when many senior aides were preparing to travel to California with the President for Thanksgiving. A White House official acknowledged that the order related directly to the Shoreham and Seabrook plants, because they are situated in or near states where governments ''have declined to participate at the point where licensing would occur were it not for the evacuation process.'' ''If you want nuclear power, you need evacuation plans for those plants,'' the official said. ''The Administration supports nuclear power and safe nuclear power plants.'' Limited Application While the Presidential order is framed broadly, it is likely in practice to have an impact on only the Seabrook and Shoreham plants. One reason is that all but a few reactors planned by the power industry have already been completed or abandoned. Another is that, of those under construction, nearly all are adjacent to one or another of more than 100 commercial nuclear reactors now operating, all of them at sites for which emergency plans have already been developed. The Governor of New Hampshire, the state in which the Seabrook reactor is situated, is John H. Sununu, a supporter of the plant whose selection as President-elect Bush's chief of staff was announced Thursday. Several weeks ago the Governor denied that he had had any role in developing the White House order, whose issuance had been a subject of speculation for some time, or that he had lobbied for it. Today Leslye Arsht, a White House spokeswoman, dismissed any speculation that Mr. Sununu had played a role in the decision. ''It's been under discussion for a long time,'' she said. ''This has been going on at least five or six months'' and was approved by the President's Domestic Policy Council several months ago. Delay 'Not Surprising' Another official, who participated in the council's discussions about the order, said it was ''not surprising'' that a decision made ''in principle'' so long ago would only now be given final approval by the President. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, acknowledged however that ''it could have been slowed down because of the election.'' As to the order's being issued so late on the last day of the work week, the official said: ''Things are in the pipeline, and people are saying, 'Let's get this done and clear them up before the holiday.' Nobody's thinking of press schedules.'' Grant C. Peterson, a senior official of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said agency executives had seen only a draft of the order. ''The timing of this issue is something you'll have to ask the people who were up and getting it signed,'' he said. What the Rules Provide The emergency plans are required by Federal regulations to provide for the safe evacuation of all people living within 10 miles of a commercial nuclear power plant in the event of an accident in which radiation is released. The plans must be approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission before that agency issues a license for the plant to operate. Local and state governments generally draft the evacuation plans, as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission envisioned they would when, in 1980, it first required such plans. Like the Shoreham reactor, the one at Seabrook, which has cost more than $5 billion and was completed in 1986, has been blocked from receiving a license by a dispute over just such emergency planning. The dispute involves Massachusetts, part of which falls within the Seabrook plant's 10-mile radius and which has refused to approve New Hampshire's plans. In New York, meanwhile, state and local officials have refused to approve any plan for Shoreham, saying the area surrounding that plant is too heavily populated to be cleared in an emergency. The Shoreham plant was allowed to operate at low power in 1985, the year it was completed, but it has never run at full power. In what appeared to be the end of a long stalemate, New York State agreed earlier this year to buy the $5.4 billion plant for $1 and a series of Lilco rate increases, then dismantle it. But as that agreement stalled in the State Legislature, Lilco continued to pursue a license for the plant. Shoreham cleared a hurdle in September when the Federal Emergency Management Agency, asked for an evaluation, said an emergency plan drawn up by the utility would protect public safety. That week, a Federal appeals court in Boston upheld the new N.R.C. rule allowing utilities to create emergency plans without the cooperation of state and local governments. Two Senators Angered Two Republican Senators from the states involved, Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York and Gordon J. Humphrey of New Hampshire, reacted with anger today to the President's order. Edward J. Martin, a spokesman for Mr. D'Amato, said: ''This is consistent with what the N.R.C. rule did, which was a blatant attempt to bypass state and local responsibility and participation in a local evacuation if an emergency should ever warrant it. And that is wrong.'' Senator Humphrey said he was particularly distressed because he and other members of the New Hampshire Congressional delegation met with Mr. Reagan in July and urged him not to sign such an order. ''He obviously hadn't been given a full briefing by his staff, and I made the point to him that this type of order violated his political philosophy,'' Mr. Humphrey said.",1988-11-19T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced Tuesday that it would decide on March 1 whether to license the Seabrook nuclear power plant, setting the stage for a legal battle. The commission is expected to approve the licensing, and challenges to such a decision are considered certain. Ron Sher, a spokesman for the plant, said preparations for full-power operation would begin immediately after a license was issued. He said it would take two to three months for the plant to reach full-power operation, although it could produce a small amount of electricity within a month. A main question for whatever court handles the promised appeals to a license is whether to halt operation of the plant pending resolution of the appeals. The $6.4 billion plant, just north of the Massachusetts line in southeastern New Hampshire, was the scene of large anti-nuclear demonstrations in the late 1970's and 1980's. The plant, which was completed in mid-1986, has remained idle because it has not received a Federal operating license. The license has been held up because Massachusetts officials say the safety of people living around the plant cannot be assured if a major accident occurs.",1990-02-22T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

The only company ever to convert a failed nuclear reactor to a generator fueled by natural gas said yesterday that it was eager to do the same at the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station, and seven other companies said they would like to study such a conversion for the Long Island Power Authority. But in a role reversal, the Long Island Lighting Company, which for years tried to build the plant, said it was skeptical that Shoreham was needed because it was too large and because Lilco has other power sources available, among other reasons. In the long fight against the reactor, opponents had made those arguments often, while Lilco had argued that Shoreham's power was vital. The proposals to study converting Shoreham from nuclear power to natural gas came yesterday in response to a request for proposals from the power authority. Lilco has agreed to sell the $5.5 billion plant to the state for $1. The Long Island authority, which has no substantial assets or operating experience, would then oversee decommissioning the plant, with the help of the New York Power Authority, which runs two reactors. Wants to Convert Shoreham Along with seven engineering and power production firms bidding for the $150,000 study contract, the CMS Energy Corporation of Jackson, Mich., said it was not only interested in studying the feasiblity of conversion, but would also like to convert Shoreham. CMS is the parent company of the Consumers Power Company, the utility that serves most of Michigan. Consumers gave up on its two Midland nuclear plants in 1984, after spending $4.1 billion, because of cost overruns, political opposition and construction flaws. It converted one of the plants to natural gas. ''We are eager to work with LIPA, the state of New York and the Long Island Lighting Company to accomplish the gas conversion, even if we do not actually perform the initial feasiblity study,'' said William T. McCormick Jr., the chairman and chief executive of CMS. The company believes it may not win the contract for the study because a large part of that job will be to study Midland, which it manages. CMS said that it had lined up the Panhandle Eastern Corporation, the second-largest gas pipeline company in the nation, and the TransCanada Pipeline Company, Canada's largest, as partners in the study. In converting Shoreham, Mr. McCormick said, CMS would consider making the project even larger than the 809 megawatts it would have generated as a nuclear reactor, and selling power to utilities from New Jersey to New England. Skepticism From Lilco ''This proposal could be a major source for the whole region,'' he said. For technical reasons, often the best way to make use of a turbine intended for a nuclear plant is to make the plant bigger. Midland 1 was intended as a 425 megawatt nuclear reactor but is a 1,370-megawatt gas-fired plant. The only other American reactor to be converted is Zimmer, a Shoreham twin in Moscow, Ohio, which is being rebuilt to run on coal. It will be 1,300 megawatts. But converting Shoreham would require expansion of existing gas pipelines into the New York region, as well as the expansion of one that is currently proposed to run from Canada to Northport, L.I., and a new line from Northport east to Shoreham. Lilco, which is also a gas utility, has expressed skepticism about this, too. A smaller company, the Long Lake Energy Corporation, of Melville, L.I., has twice presented the Long Island Power Authority board with proposals for conversion to gas and filed a study proposal yesterday. Matthew C. Cordaro, senior vice president of Long Lake, said his company was ''interested in assisting them in any way, mostly in playing a development role in the project.'' Mr. Cordaro is a former vice president of Lilco, where he was ''the guy in charge of many of the studies that showed why it was impractical to convert Shoreham to non-nuclear use.'' 'We're Very Receptive' He said that completing Shoreham as a reactor always won out over conversion because of the investment in the plant as a reactor. With that investment written off, he said, conversion was feasible. The Long Island authority has not yet decided whether Shoreham should be converted, whether other plants should be built instead, or whether demand and supply should be kept in balance through efficiency improvements. Richard Kessel, chairman of the authority, said the first step is to determine whether a conversion is technically feasible, practical and environmentally and economically sound. If it meets those criteria, he said, ''we're very receptive to it.'' How much of the $5.5 billion Shoreham plant would be useful in a conversion to gas is not clear. Also not clear is who would own a gas-fired Shoreham. In Michigan, the utility contributed the physical assets and received a 49 percent share of a new entity that owns the gas plant. Gas pipeline companies and other investors own the rest. A 'Curious' Lilco Officials say that a converted Shoreham could be owned in part or entirely by the power authority, or entirely by private investors, including CMS, which would be free to sell the power to Lilco or other utilities. A spokesman for Lilco, Joseph W. McDonnell, said the company was ''curious to see how they're going to make it economical.'' He added that under Public Service Commission rules, when Lilco needs additional power, it now must allow outside suppliers to bid on producing it. ''We have an open mind, because they will be competing in the market place to sell the power at an economic rate,'' he said. He noted that Lilco is now seeking bids for 150 megawatts of power, to be supplied beginning in 1994. Other companies proposing to study a conversion were Resource Management International, a consulting firm, of Sacramento, Calif.; three architect-engineering firms with nuclear experience, Black & Veatch of Kansas City, United Engineers & Constructor of Philadelphia and Fluor Daniel of Chicago, and two smaller firms, Compass Services Inc. of Liverpool, N.Y., and the Energotechnology Corporation of Cambridge, Md.",1989-11-07T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Less attention, though, is being paid to what may be a more destabilizing development: next year Japan plans to bring its long-delayed Rokkasho reprocessing plant online, which could extract as much as eight tons of weapons-usable plutonium from spent reactor fuel a year, enough for nearly 1,000 warheads. That would add to Japan’s existing stockpile of 44 tons, 9 of which are stored in domestic facilities. Japan has repeatedly vowed never to develop nuclear weapons, and there’s no reason to doubt that now. But there’s more to worry about: reprocessing not only creates a tempting target for terrorists, it also sets a precedent for countries around the world to follow suit — and pushes the world toward rampant nuclear proliferation. Originally, Japan, like other countries, considered the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel necessary to obtain start-up plutonium for a new generation of plutonium “breeder” reactors that would use uranium more efficiently. But uranium remains cheap and abundant, and the planned reactors, so-called molten-sodium-cooled breeders, proved to be costly and unreliable. Japan’s own Monju prototype breeder reactor operated for only four months in 1995 before a sodium fire shut it down. Its operators are still struggling to restart it. Japan then shifted to a strategy of recycling separated plutonium back into the fuel of its existing reactors. That effort was delayed by technical problems and public opposition and, in the wake of last year’s Fukushima accident, appears completely unviable. Still, Japan continues to plan to reprocess its nuclear fuel. And it does so despite international pressure. At a nuclear-security event in Seoul, South Korea, last March, President Obama said , “We simply can’t go on accumulating huge amounts of the very material, like separated plutonium, that we are trying to keep away from terrorists.” Not only did Japanese authorities ignore him, but some reprocessing advocates claim that the Obama administration in fact supports Japan’s plutonium recycling program. Japan insists that its stockpiles are safe, but just one successful theft by would-be nuclear terrorists would create a global crisis. Of even more concern is how reprocessing provides cover for other countries to acquire a nuclear option. We learned this in 1974 when India took plutonium enriched with help from the American Atoms for Peace program and used it for a “peaceful nuclear explosion.” Thanks to sustained diplomatic efforts, starting with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, and to the high cost of reprocessing, Japan is the only non-nuclear state that continues to reprocess its nuclear fuel . South Korea is insisting, however, in its negotiation of a new Agreement of Nuclear Cooperation with the United States, that it should have the same right to reprocess as Japan. South Korea isn’t alone. South Africa’s energy minister recently reasserted her country’s interest in reprocessing. When asked why the country would want to embark on such a costly venture, a South African nuclear official once responded, “Reprocessing is the currency of power in the modern world!” Meanwhile, Iran insists that it has the same rights as Japan and is building a reactor similar to the one India used to produce the plutonium for its first nuclear bombs. Despite the added cost of reprocessing — about $2.5 billion a year for the new facility — Japan insists it is the only viable option for the spent nuclear fuel which is filling up the cooling pools at its reactors. But there are easier alternatives. When nuclear power plants in most other countries need space in their pools, they remove some of the older, cooler fuel and place it in air-cooled casks within the plant’s security perimeter. That costs 5 percent as much as reprocessing does. Eventually, the spent fuel is to be shipped to an underground repository, as is to be done with the high-level radioactive waste from reprocessing. Reprocessing advocates in Japan and South Korea say that communities around the nuclear power plants will not allow dry-cask storage and that, when the spent fuel pools fill up, the power plants will have to shut down. But in both countries those local governments receive large subsidies and taxes — typically 50 percent of a municipality’s revenue in Japan — for playing host to nuclear power plants. They are unlikely to force permanent shutdowns just because they don’t like extra spent fuel kept at the reactor site, especially if the safety advantages of dry-cask storage are explained to them. The Obama administration should make it emphatically clear to Japan’s government that the separation of more plutonium is in no one’s interest. The two countries should instead jointly lead a global effort to reduce existing stocks of separated plutonium by discouraging reprocessing and encouraging safe disposal of already separated stocks, which could be done, for example, by immobilizing the plutonium and placing it in three-mile-deep boreholes. The waste of trillions of taxpayers’ yen is Japan’s problem. The risk it presents, however, is the whole world’s concern.",2012-11-29T02:50:42.000+01:00,NYTIMES,oped-opinion

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted today to move toward adoption of less stringent emergency evacuation requirements at nuclear reactors. By a vote of 4 to 1, the commission ordered the publication of a proposed rule change that would permit the operation of reactors at Shoreham, L.I., and Seabrook, N.H., at full power without state and local participation in their emergency evacuation plans. The multibillion-dollar plants have been completed, but their owners have been unable to operate them at full power for commercial use because state and local officials have refused to participate in required emergency planning, contending that safe evacuation is impossible. The amendment was sharply criticized by Governor Cuomo of New York and a number of other governors, senators and representatives at a hearing held here Tuesday, before the change was formally proposed. Final Vote in April Once the proposal is published in the Federal Register, proponents and critics will have 60 days to write to the commission to make their positions known. At the end of April the commission would take another vote on whether to adopt the rule or to amend it. In a statement late today announcing the decision, Lando W. Zech Jr., a retired Navy admiral who became the commission's chairman last July, said that despite the heated opposition expressed at Tuesday's hearing the commission majority ''concluded that we should publish the proposed rule for public comment so that we may receive the benefit of the broadest possible spectrum of comment.'' The lone negative vote was cast today by Commissioner James K. Asselstine, a frequent dissenter on nuclear safety issues. Legal Challenges Threatened Even if the rule takes effect, the controversy over it would not end. Spokesmen for the states of New York and Massachusetts have vowed to challenge the rule in the court. And Representative George J, Hochbrueckner, a Suffolk County Democrat whose Congressional District includes the Shoreham plant, said today he would press for enactment of his bill to ''prohibit the commission from changing its rules to suit the terms of the nuclear power industry.'' The bill is one of several on the subject introduced this year. The existing rule was adopted by the commission after the Three Mile Island reactor accident in Pennsylvania in 1979. It requires operators of nuclear power plants to draw up detailed plans, tested in a drill, to rapidly evacuate all residents within a 10-mile radius in the event of a serious accident with radioactive emissions. In the licensing impasse at the Shoreham and Seabrook reactors, the local and state authorities have declared such an evacuation impossible and have declined to join in the planning or lend police and fire department support. 'The Realism Doctrine' The proposed amendment to the rule would empower the commission to presume that any ''noncooperative'' state and local authorities would, in fact, respond in an actual emergency and that, therefore, an operating license should be granted. William C. Parler, the commission's general counsel, has called this assumption ''the realism doctrine.'' Reached for comment in Albany after the Commission's action today, Governor Cuomo said: ''The Nuclear Regulatory Commission continues to diminish the little credibility it has. The commissioners have achieved a distressing predictability - they do what the utilities want.'' In his testimony here on Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo quoted from a 1984 letter from President Reagan to a Long Island Congressman in which the President declared, ''This Administration does not favor the imposition of Federal authority over the objections of state and local governments in matters regarding the adequacy of an emergency evacuation plan for a nuclear power plant.'' Mr. Cuomo said that, by today's vote, the commissioners ''have repudiated the President.'' Conspiracy Theory Proposed Herbert Brown, a lawyer here for Suffolk County, said comments that would be filed in oppositon to the proposed rule change will show that it ''is the fruit of connivance between the Federal Department of Energy, the White House staff and some of the nuclear power industry, dating back several years.'' In his statement today, Mr. Zech, the commission's chairman, said he wished to ''emphasize that, whether this proposed rule is enacted or not, public safety - and not economics -will always be the commission's primary consideration in deciding whether to license a nuclear power plant.''",1987-02-27T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts owes a large debt to the owners of the Seabrook nuclear plant in New Hampshire: $2 billion. That's the cost of his refusal to help his New Hampshire neighbors devise an emergency evacuation plan. Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts owes a large debt to the owners of the Seabrook nuclear plant in New Hampshire: $2 billion. That's the cost of his refusal to help his New Hampshire neighbors devise an emergency evacuation plan. The plant was ready to run in October 1986, and interest and maintenance costs have been growing at a rate of $50 million a month ever since. New Hampshire finally devised its own plan, and last week Federal regulators voted to grant an operating license. The plant will probably be running soon, but burdened with the vast costs of this pointless delay. Mr. Dukakis's office, unrepentant, says the investors knew the risks. But it's his risk estimates that were awry. He exaggerated the dangers of nuclear power, while spurning those of climatic warming. American nuclear power plants, Seabrook included, have many faults. They are too large, too expensive and too complex. Mr. Dukakis bears only part of the blame for the fact that Seabrook is 12 times over cost and 11 years behind schedule. But technology isn't wholly to blame, either. As the French have proved, plants using the basic American model can be built quickly and designed to run safely. France now uses nuclear power to produce 70 percent of its electricity. But France does not have state governors like Mr. Dukakis and New York's Mario Cuomo. Following the Three Mile Island disaster, states were required to help devise emergency escape plans. Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Cuomo used this duty as a veto. Mr. Dukakis offered the Chernobyl disaster as a reason for not cooperating on Seabrook, even though the Soviet reactor had an entirely different design. Mr. Cuomo, citing public worries over an escape plan, effectively killed the completed reactor at Shoreham, wasting a $5.5 billion asset. These policies - along with copious errors by reactor builders and utilities - have brought America's nuclear industry to stagnation. So daunting are the political prospects that newer, more efficient plants are unlikely to get off the drawing boards. Meanwhile, technological leadership has passed to Japan. Construction of a new plant takes five years there, compared with 11 in the U.S. And as Japan searches busily for an advanced generation of reactors, the infrastructure required to build nuclear plants dwindles in America. Maybe the nuclear option will turn out to be a dead end. If so, Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Cuomo will have only helped speed its demise. But oil prices could rise sharply, and solar energy could take decades more to develop. The greenhouse warming of the atmosphere could then create a premium for nuclear power plants, which don't produce greenhouse gases. There would be a worldwide demand for such plants, but the U.S. may by then have frozen itself out of the market. The smarter strategy would be to keep the nuclear option open. Environmentalists are inconsistent when they press for action to avert greenhouse warming while remaining adamantly opposed to nuclear power. They recently condemned John Sununu, the White House chief of staff, for opposing swift measures against warming; yet as Governor of New Hampshire, Mr. Sununu strongly supported the Seabrook reactor. It's leaders like Governors Dukakis and Cuomo who obstruct the one kind of baseload power plant that produces no greenhouse gases. In the crowded annals of human folly, the sagas of Seabrook and Shoreham will surely rate a space.",1990-03-12T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,opinion

Orbiting reactors, officials believe, will be essential for powering antimissile weapons and future scientific missions, including deep-space probes, space stations and manned outposts on THE Federal Government is moving ahead with plans to put nuclear reactors and nuclear rocket engines in space for both civilian and military uses. Orbiting reactors, officials believe, will be essential for powering antimissile weapons and future scientific missions, including deep-space probes, space stations and manned outposts on Mars and the moon. As the plans become more widely known, however, they are stirring protests by private groups who say the nuclear technologies are so dangerous that they should be banned from space. Federal officials say that such nuclear reactors are more powerful, compact and rugged than large arrays of solar cells - the usual source of space power. The Government has already signed a multimillion-dollar contract with the General Electric Company for construction of a prototype space reactor. Three agencies, the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, are jointly sponsoring the project. The Government is also considering nuclear-powered rocket engines, which are seen as cheaper and more efficient than conventional chemical rockets. The Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico recently started to study them for the Air Force, which envisons nuclear-powered space tugs carrying payloads from orbits near the Earth to far distant locations. Some experts fear that nuclear reactors and engines orbiting overhead pose a danger of unexpected re-entry into the earth's atmosphere. Their safe operation, critics say, is made especially difficult by the weightlessness and extreme temperatures of space, which add to the overall risk of serious accidents. ''You can argue that reactors in orbit should be banned,'' said Steven Aftergood, director of the Committee to Bridge the Gap, a private group, based in Los Angeles, that monitors nuclear space technologies. ''They're too risky. They might have merit if used far away from earth. Reactors for propulsion, for instance, might be interesting for deep-space exploratory missions.'' 'We Can Do It Safely' In response, Federal officials say safety has become the top priority in the design of nuclear devices for use in space, if only because a worried public, and its representatives in Congress, might otherwise cut funds. ''We can do it safely,'' said Earl J. Wahlquist, director of the space reactor program at the Department of Energy. ''We feel we can address any problems that arise.'' A. David Rossin, who recently resigned as Assistant Secretary of Energy for nuclear energy, told a symposium earlier this year that the reactor accidents at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and Chernobyl in the Soviet Union, compounded with last year's space shuttle disaster, ''has a skeptical and disillusioned public very much on edge about nuclear power in space.'' He urged engineers working on such projects to ''build significant credibility with the public by articulating our successes, by listening and responding, by being open and frank.'' For years, despite the dangers, both superpowers have shot nuclear reactors into space - the Russians with relative frequency. The Soviet Union has launched 31 nuclear-powered spy satellites that use powerful radars for military surveilance, two of which have unexpectedly re-entered the atmosphere and rained radioactive debris on the earth. Re-Entry in 4,000 Years In 1965, in its first and only such experiment, the United States launched a reactor into a near-circular polar orbit of 8,000 miles. The reactor worked flawlessly for 43 days and then failed after an error by a ground controller. The West is newly interested in space reactors because they can generate so much power. Solar panels on satellites, made up of hundreds and thousand of tiny solar cells, often generate less than a kilowatt of electrical power. This is barely enough to power a kitchen toaster or hair dryer but enough for the delicate electronic circuits on many satellites. In contrast, laser battle stations for ''Star Wars'' antimissile systems could require as much electricity in space as small cities use on Earth. Outposts on the moon or Mars would also require vast amounts of electricity for manufacturing, science experiments and life support. Currently, the main effort in the United States is to develop a multimission reactor of 100 kilowatts that would fit into the cargo bay of the space shuttle. Known as the SP-100, the reactor core, minus its pipes, shielding, radiators and electric converters, is about the size of a basketball. It would use thermoelectric generators to turn heat from the reactor into electrical energy. General Electric is to finish testing a working model of the system by the 1991 or 1992, and flight tests are scheduled to begin by the mid 1990's. G.E.'s five-year contract to design, build and direct the ground demonstration testing of the space reactor is expected to total $350 million. Not Inherently Evil ''Space nuclear power is not inherently good or evil, but it is inherently dangerous,'' said Mr. Aftergood of the Committee to Bridge the Gap. ''The Government hasn't been entirely bad. There has been an awareness of the importance of nuclear safety. The crunch comes when you get into a conflict between safety and other factors, such as limited funding or wanting to have maximum flexibility in deployment.'' Mr. Wahlquist of the Department of Energy disagreed, saying the reactor had been ''designed to avoid any kind of problem people could postulate.'' For instance, it is not to operate during the launching, so that an expectedly large explosion could not spread lethal fission products that accumulate in working reactors. And in a space accident involving the loss of reactor coolant, he said, ''the system would shut down and there would be no disruption of the core.'' Mr. Aftergood, an engineer by training, questioned whether Government officials were doing everything possible to insure safety, saying ''they have retreated from their previous position in which they would put reactors only in nuclear-safe orbits,'' a relatively distant place in space from which it would take at least 300 years for a reactor to re-enter the earth's atmosphere. The apparent reason, he said, was that the Pentagon might want to deploy reactors in low-earth orbits to power ''Star Wars'' antimissile weapons. ''This elimination of the nuclear safe-orbit criterion will significantly reduce safety,'' Mr. Aftergood said. In response, Federal officials say it is far too early to speculate about how and where reactors might be used, noting that years of development and testing were needed just to explore the concept's feasiblity. Direct Nuclear Propulsion At the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico, Federal scientists are going far beyond nuclear reactors that produce electricity to investigate direct nuclear propulsion - a technology whose development was abandoned more than a decade ago. In the 1950's and 1960's, the United States spent hundreds of millions of dollars to perfect nuclear space propulsion, the focus being engines for missiles and rockets. The goal was to create a reactor to heat a propellant such as liquid hydrogen, which would be fired out the back of the engine to produce forward thrust. Despite some success in ground tests, most especially with a prototype reactor known as Rover, a nuclear-powered rocket never got off the ground and the work was abandoned in the early 1970's. Today Los Alamos is dusting off its earlier work and looking again into the feasiblity of nuclear engines. ''We'll be using the last small engine from the Rover program'' and moving forward from there, said Richard J. Bohl of the lab's Space Nuclear Power Program. The Los Alamos work is sponsored by the Air Force Astronautics Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base in California, which is sponsoring similar work at other Federal laboratories. The Air Force says it wants to use nuclear engines to move supplies and devices from orbiting space shuttles to more distant points. ''We're advocating a national effort in nuclear propuslion,'' said Air Force Lt. Ryan K. Haaland, project manager for nuclear proplusion at Air Force Astronatics Labs. ''The higher performance of nuclear engines allows us to reduce operational costs, saving the Government money.''",1987-10-06T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,science

Community groups in both states are opposing the extensions of the licenses beyond their 40-year terms, but environmentalists are generally supportive of the proposed agreement among the governors to reduce these greenhouse gases, which contribute to global climate change. Shutting down the two reactors would mean immediate, substantial increases in the emissions, because it would increase reliance on fossil fuel plants, probably tripling emissions in Vermont and doubling them in New Jersey. ''I think the environmental community is confused right now in terms of where they want to go,'' said Richard A. Valentinetti, director of Vermont's air quality program, who has been deeply involved in drafting the nine-state agreement. ''Obviously there's some real polarization.'' Some environmentalists say the goals can be met even without the two nuclear plants, Vermont Yankee and Oyster Creek, and without other nuclear plants whose licenses will expire in the next few years. ''We just have to bust the myth that we need to be using more energy,'' said Rob Sargent, senior energy policy analyst for the State Public Interest Research Groups, a nonprofit consumer organization. The New Jersey affiliate of his group is a leading voice against Oyster Creek, the nation's oldest commercial nuclear plant. Mr. Sargent said that rising electricity prices would make many new energy-saving technologies practical, but he acknowledged that simply saving money would not be enough to reduce power consumption by the required amount. Engineers and environmental experts have long predicted that planners would eventually have to choose between greater greenhouse gas emissions and heavier reliance on nuclear power. The debate has been mostly hypothetical, since nobody in the United States has ordered a new nuclear plant since the 1970's, long before global climate change was widely perceived as an issue. It was also hypothetical because there were no limits on carbon dioxide emissions in the United States. Suddenly, both parts of the question are changing. The governors are proposing a cap on emissions, and renewal of power plant licenses has become imminent. Oyster Creek opened near Egg Harbor, N.J., in 1969 and its license expires in 2009. A little over half the electricity produced in New Jersey comes from nuclear power, and Oyster Creek alone produces about 9 percent; in 2004 it generated 27.1 million megawatt hours. In December 2004, the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group came out against a license extension. It said that the plant was designed to last 40 years, and that the decision by Exelon, Oyster Creek's owner, to seek a license extension was ''ignoring public safety.'' The plant is in a rapidly growing part of the state, the group noted, and it argued that in an emergency evacuation would be impractical. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced on Monday that it had evaluated the application by Exelon for a license extension, and had decided that it merited review. Vermont Yankee, in Vernon, near the border with Massachusetts and New Hampshire, began commercial operation in November 1972, and its license expires in March 2012. Its capacity is 535 megawatts. In 2004 the reactor produced 3.9 million megawatt hours, which was about 71 percent of the electricity produced in the state. (That production was only about one-third of the electricity consumed in the state, because Vermont is a chronic importer of power.) Just how much carbon dioxide the two reactors are saving depends on what the replacement power source would be. A megawatt-hour from a coal plant produces about one ton of carbon dioxide. In the long run, power companies could build natural gas plants, which produce only about half a ton per megawatt hour. The governors' draft agreement gives Vermont a limit of 1.35 million tons of carbon dioxide, approximately equal to its current emissions. But if the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant's output were replaced with coal, Vermont's emissions would increase by nearly four million tons. If natural gas were used, the increase would still be nearly two million tons. The agreement gives New Jersey a cap of 23 million tons, but if Oyster Creek's output was replaced with coal, the state's output of carbon dioxide would more than double. Some environmentalists say that greenhouse emissions should be cut by switching to ''renewable'' fuels, including wind, solar and hydroelectric. Wind-produced power, in fact, is growing rapidly, but over all, electricity from renewable sources in 2004 was about 1 percent lower than in 2003, mostly because of less hydroelectric production. Environmentalists propose reducing carbon dioxide output by building wind turbines. But utility experts say that the amount of wind that a utility grid can tolerate is limited, because wind is intermittent and often unpredictable. In fact, the ''capacity factor'' of a wind turbine, defined as the amount of power actually produced in a year, compared with the amount that would result from around-the-clock generation, is about 33 percent. In addition to Vermont and New Jersey, the seven other states in the accord are New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island.",2005-09-14T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,national-desk

Minor, 62, an Engineer Who Criticized Nuclear Power","Gregory Charles Minor, one of three middle-management engineers who caused a stir when they quit the General Electric reactor division in 1976 to protest nuclear power, died on July 20 at his home in Telluride, Colo. He was 62. The cause was leukemia, which had been diagnosed in early June, Jim Burch, a friend in Palo Alto, Calif., said. Mr. Minor, Richard B. Hubbard and Dale G. Bridenbaugh resigned from the division of G.E. that built nuclear reactors, saying that they believed nuclear power presented a profound threat to mankind. All three were managing engineers who had spent most of their careers building reactors, and their defection galvanized anti-nuclear groups across the country. ''My reason for leaving,'' Mr. Minor declared, ''is a deep conviction that nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons now present a serious danger to the future of all life on this planet.'' In Congressional testimony, the three cited the possibility of human error and asserted that nuclear engineers had become so specialized that none of them could see the whole picture any longer. As a result, they said, no one was in control. The three founded a consulting firm, MHB Technical Associates, in San Jose, Calif. For 20 years they conducted studies and testified on the safety, reliability, construction and economics of power plants. Mr. Minor evaluated energy programs for Federal agencies, 13 states, the Governments of Sweden and Germany and public-interest groups around the world. MHB was technical adviser on the 1979 movie ''The China Syndrome,'' which was denounced by the nuclear industry but seemed prophetic when the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania experienced a partial meltdown that year. A native of Fresno, Calif., Mr. Minor was a 1960 electrical engineering graduate of the University of California at Berkeley. He earned an M.S. degree at Stanford University in 1966. He went to work for G.E. in 1960. While there, he managed an engineering group working on new designs for reactor controls, safety systems and control rooms. Early this year he and Mr. Hubbard followed Mr. Bridenbaugh into retirement and closed their company. Mr. Minor's illness was diagnosed after a lengthy stay in France, and he opted against radiation and chemotherapy to spend his remaining time visiting family members and friends. Mr. Minor is survived by a son, Mark, of Salida, Colo.; two daughters, Lisa Buckley of Soquel, Calif., and Tani Scheiner of Sebastopol, Calif.; two sisters, Sue Bird of Hilo, Hawaii, and Michelle Minor of Vancouver, B.C.; and six grandchildren.

The new information is a significant reversal of reassuring statements issued Saturday, and it raised new questions about what appears to be Japan's worst nuclear-power accident. The officials said today that operators at the Mihama plant delayed because they thought that a gauge showing an alarming increase in radioactivity in a cooling chamber might be registering false readings. Minutes after workers began to reduce the power, an emergency system shut down the plant and injected water into the reactor's core to prevent a meltdown of nuclear fuel. Earlier Reassurance Reversed Earlier, Government officials and Kansai Electric Power Company said operators reacted quickly to shut the plant down at the first signs of trouble, and insisted that no radiation had been released beyond the plant site. The plant is in the town of Mihama in Fukui prefecture, about 220 miles west of Tokyo on the Sea of Japan. But Japanese press reports said today that the radioactivity appeared to amount to about 8 percent of the plant's annual emissions. Local officials and citizen groups monitoring radioactivity in the region said today that they had detected no noticeable increases. Nonetheless, the new details seem likely to embarrass the Government, whose plans call for more than doubling the nation's 37 nuclear plants. Japan's constant examination of the effects of radioactivity from the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 make pushing for nuclear power difficult in the best of times. But now it is particularly complicated, largely because several small accidents at nuclear plants have fed a growing anti-nuclear movement. The apparent cause of Saturday's accident, officials said, was a breach in small tubes that carry radioactive water that has been super-heated in the nuclear core. The water is supposed to remain in the tubes until it is pumped back for reheating. Heat from the tubes is used to boil clean water outside the tubes. The resulting steam drives a turbine and produces electric power. In the accident, the radioactive water leaked, contaminating the water in the steam generator. Water Leak Estimated at 20 Tons The company has called leaks in the tubes ""fractures,"" similar to others found in aging nuclear power plants. The Mihama reactor has been in operation since 1972. But this morning, the Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's largest dailies, said that roughly 20 tons of water was released before the plant shut down, suggesting a much larger leak. That caused a drop in the pressure of cooling water, triggering the emergency system. The company has not said whether the accident proceeded to the next step, in which the loss of pressure allows water in the core to boil. In that case, cooling would nearly stop, and the fuel could melt, releasing large amounts of radioactive material. Several reactors in the United States have suffered such accidents, but none has resulted in melted fuel. According to the nuclear safety division of the prefecture, a worker saw a gauge showing a jump in the radioactivity level in the generator at 12:40 P.M. on Saturday, but another gauge did not show a similar rise. ""We never thought that the radiation could increase so quickly because such a thing hadn't happened before,"" Motokazu Maekawa, a safety official, was quoted as telling The Associated Press. ""It is so inconvenient to stop the whole thing if the monitor was showing the increase because it was broken."" By the time the workers determined that the accident was real, radiation levels had surged again and pressure in the reactor vessel was dropping precipitously. They began to reduce power levels, but minutes later, the cooling system flooded the core. It was the first time that such a system has operated in an emergency in Japan.",1991-02-12T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,world

Hours before the barrages, there were reports that conditions were unraveling in and near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. The flight of civilians from the area accelerated on Saturday. The plant is the first active nuclear power plant in a combat zone.

Contrary to the fears of some analysts when Moscow launched its invasion in February, the more urgent nuclear threat in the Ukraine war now appears to be Russia damaging the civilian plant, rather than deploying its own nuclear weapons. Russia says it’s Ukrainian forces who are shelling the plant. Engineers say that yard-thick reinforced concrete containment structures protect the reactors from even direct hits. International concern, however, has grown that shelling could spark a fire or cause other damage that would lead to a nuclear accident. The six pressurized water reactors at the complex retain most sources of radiation, reducing risks. After pressurized water reactors failed at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan in 2011, Ukraine upgraded the Zaporizhzhia site to enable a shutdown even after the loss of cooling water from outside the containment structures, Dmytro Gortenko, a former plant engineer, said in an interview.

The company, based in East Kilbride, Scotland, said it had written down the value of its British nuclear plants by £3.6 billion, or more than 80 percent, and that of a coal-fired plant in Eggborough, England, by £151 million. Excluding the write-downs, British Energy lost £130 million for the fiscal year, a reversal from a £42 million profit the year before. ''The past year has been traumatic for British Energy and its stakeholders,'' said its chairman, Adrian Montague, in a statement today. A combination of high fixed costs at the nuclear plants, a decline in power prices, a number of power interruptions and a ''bleak outlook'' for future prices contributed to the loss, Mr. Montague said. As deregulation has divided Britain's electricity system into separate power producers and distributors in the last decade, the producers have suffered from overcapacity and low prices. Wholesale power prices have fallen some 40 percent since deregulation. British Energy grew so financially weak last fall that it needed a government bailout to avoid bankruptcy; the government agreed to pay £2 billion to help cover the company's nuclear-related liabilities. British Energy's stock has lost more than 95 percent of its value in the last year; it closed today at 4.35 pence in London. British Energy's future hinges on obtaining approval from the European Commission in Brussels for a restructuring plan that includes the £2 billion in aid from the British Department of Trade and Industry. Under the aid package's terms, a government-backed fund would cover any shortfalls in British Energy's ability to pay for the cost of decommissioning its nuclear power plants as their useful life ends; in return, British Energy would pay a portion of its future profits to the fund. The plan was submitted March 7, and a decision is expected within 12 months. Some analysts say that the plan is certain to win approval, so that with last year's losses behind it, British Energy should have smooth sailing ahead. ''It is going to be a viable company,'' said Iain Turner, an energy analyst at Deutsche Bank. Others disagree that approval of the plan is a sure thing. It is opposed by an unusual coalition of environmentalists, nonnuclear energy producers and companies that make electricity from renewable sources like sunlight and wind. The three groups oppose the plan on the ground that it favors British Energy and its nuclear plants over rivals. The AES Corporation of Arlington, Va., which owns Drax, the largest coal-fired power plant in Britain, petitioned the European Commission to reject the plan because it would artificially depress power prices. Greenpeace and Ecotricity, a British wind and solar energy company, protested that the plan would leave no room in the market for alternative energy sources. ''British Energy's position has never looked more bleak,'' Greenpeace said today in a statement. Under an earlier restructuring plan, British Energy was to sell off its half-interest in AmerGen, a joint venture with the Exelon Corporation of Chicago, by June 30 of this year. AmerGen owns Three Mile Island and the Oyster Creek nuclear power plant in Waretown, N.J. Antinuclear activists in New Jersey are campaigning to shut down Oyster Creek by 2009 because of the threat of terrorism and the large number of people who live near it. British Energy said in March that it had yet to receive a suitable offer for its stake in AmerGen. Company executives told analysts today on a conference call that British Energy was in talks with several companies about AmerGen, but did not give specifics. In April, British Energy, which supplies electricity to one out of every six homes in Britain, paid off a £650 million government loan using the proceeds from its sale of a Canadian subsidiary last year, according to Bloomberg News.",2003-06-04T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business

No utility has gone through the long, laborious and expensive process of having a license renewed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the application by Duke Power, a unit of the Duke Energy Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., is seen as an initiative whose outcome could determine the future of nuclear energy in the United States. Duke's progress in getting the license renewed, which would enable it to operate the three-unit Oconee nuclear power station in western South Carolina another 20 years, will be watched by other utilities that must decide whether to seek renewal or decommission their nuclear plants and build nonnuclear operations to replace them. There are big stakes involved for utilities, consumers and environmental groups. For many utilities nuclear plants are the cheapest generators of electricity and have become more attractive as the industry deregulates. Joe F. Colvin, president and chief executive of the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry trade and lobbying group, said most nuclear plants could produce electricity at about 1.9 cents a kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than natural gas plants, which average about 3 cents a kilowatt-hour. ''You can beat any competitor coming at you,'' Mr. Colvin said. Some utilities have chosen to decommission their aging nuclear plants, which can be very costly. Building new plants is also expensive. Consumers would probably bear most of the cost through higher rates. For environmentalists, closing older plants would reduce the amount of nuclear waste that must be disposed of. It could also result, however, in building more coal-fired plants, which emit carbon dioxide, a gas linked to global warming. With so much riding on the outcome, Duke has given itself a great deal of lead time. By filing for a license renewal with the N.R.C. now, it hopes to complete the process in three years, well before its 40-year license to operate the three units of its Oconee Nuclear station expires in 2013. Oconee, which was built in 1973, is capable of producing 2,538 megawatts of power. It has produced 24 percent of the electricity used by Duke's two million customers in North and South Carolina. Michael S. Tuckman, the executive vice president for nuclear generation at Duke, said in a telephone conference yesterday that the plant would be a test case for the industry in how the licensing procedure would work and whether the standards set by the commission would be economical to meet. He said that before filing for its application, Duke had asked other utilities to review and comment on it because they would have to decide whether to seek renewals as well. If Duke encounters difficulty in the renewal process, other utilities might decide not to try a similar effort. In April, another utility, Baltimore Gas and Electric, filed to renew the license for its Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant, which can produce 1,875 megawatts of electricity. And the largest operator of nuclear plants, Commonwealth Edison of Chicago, a subsidiary of the Unicom Corporation, said yesterday that it would sell its six coal-fired plants, which have a book value of about $1.1 billion, and use the money to improve the performance of its nuclear plants. The N.R.C. oversees 107 working nuclear plants that produce 22 percent of the nation's electricity. Duke has prepared for its renewal effort by consulting with the staff of the commission on how to measure the wear and durability of equipment in plants. Mr. Tuckman, however, said the process could extend another three years, through hearings, inspections and tests. He said the utility had already spent $8 million preparing its filing, which will be delivered to the commission in Washington today. He said the utility expected to spend another $8 million before a decision was reached. Mr. Tuckman added that the plant had been continually upgraded during its life and that the utility must demonstrate that it could be maintained in good condition another 20 years after its license expires in 2013. The plant has generally had a solid safety record, but it had some accidents in recent years. A steam line ruptured in 1995 and seven workers were injured, several seriously. In 1990, a line became disconnected from a reactor head and radioactive water leaked but was kept and treated in the containment building.",1998-07-07T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business

They set off from Kyiv on Wednesday morning after a news conference outlining one of the most complicated missions in the agency’s history. The I.A.E.A. has also worked in Iraq, Iran and North Korea. A senior Ukrainian official warned that many challenges remained as the group made its way to the plant. One of the biggest obstacles will be finding safe passage through an active battlefield to the Russian-occupied facility. To reach the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the team must negotiate the craters and trenches of the front lines and enter an area where frequent shelling has raised fears of a nuclear catastrophe. The team could reach the front line between Russian and Ukrainian forces as early as Wednesday afternoon. “As you know, we have a very, very important task there to perform, to assess the real situation there, to help stabilize the situation as much as we can,” the I.A.E.A. director general, Rafael Grossi, told reporters in Kyiv early Wednesday before departing in a convoy of armored S.U.V. vehicles. Monitors intended to spend several days in the Russian-occupied nuclear facility, and will seek to establish a permanent monitoring mission at the plant, Mr. Grossi said. “After six months of steady efforts, the I.A.E.A. is moving in to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,” he said. The Russian-appointed head of the Zaporizhzhia region, Yevhen Balytskyi, contradicted Mr. Grossi and said the visit is only expected to last one day, calling the delegation’s stated goal for the visit vague. “They have one day to inspect the operation of the plant,” he said, adding: “If they say some elements need to be attended to, we’ll be able to do so.” Before the experts set out for the nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, they tried to broker some kind of deal with the two militaries. Fighting is intensifying in the south, where Ukraine is escalating strikes in what could be part of broader counteroffensive. By early Wednesday, Mr. Grossi said the mission had secured safety guarantees from both the Russian and Ukrainian militaries, though dangers lingered. “We are going to a war zone, we are going to occupied territory,” he said. Both Russia, whose forces seized the plant not long after invading, and Ukraine, whose military holds positions only a few miles away, say they support the I.A.E.A. mission. But they have disagreed on how it should be carried out. Russian officials have ignored pleas to withdraw from the facility to create a demilitarized zone around it. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine’s president, said in an interview on Tuesday that key aspects of the negotiations were in question, among them the route to the facility. He said he was still hopeful, however, that the monitors would reach the plant “one way or another.”",2022-08-31T08:56:06.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

It could also prevent the country from dealing with climate change. By shutting down nuclear plants faster than those for coal, Germany may consign itself to dependence on fossil fuels, and all the damage to the climate they cause, for longer than necessary. Nevertheless, Germans’ opposition to nuclear power endures: 60 percent of them want to get rid of it as soon as possible. Paranoia is not exactly the right word to describe the attitude behind these figures, though. Rather, it is the very German trait of freezing when faced with a dilemma. For a nation that is as keen as ours to do what would undoubtedly be considered good, choosing between two evils — here, nuclear power and climate change — is a nearly insurmountable task. Nuclear energy, to start with, is ultimately not safe, and the Germans have always been particularly uneasy with it. After the nuclear accident at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan in 2011, Chancellor Angela Merkel ordered the “Atomausstieg,” the exit from nuclear energy once and for all. Why? Because, as Ms. Merkel put it back then: “The residual risk of nuclear energy can be accepted only if one is convinced that — as far as it is humanly possible to judge — it won’t come to pass.” After Fukushima, Ms. Merkel, a trained physicist, was no longer able to believe that a nuclear disaster would not occur. That there was a catastrophe even in a high-tech country like Japan made her change her mind. But what about the near-certain catastrophic consequences of the second evil, climate change enhanced by coal-fired plants? Ms. Merkel recognized recently that “climate change is happening faster than we had thought a couple of years ago.” At the same time, she had to admit that Germany was struggling to fulfill the promises of the Paris climate accord: Despite new hopeful figures, the targeted 40 percent reduction of carbon emissions by the end of 2020 may not be met. One could argue that knowledge about the severity of climate change has deepened since 2011 and that countries should do everything they can to shift away from fossil fuels — yet there’s no sign that Ms. Merkel might change her mind about scrapping nuclear. A return to nuclear appears to be completely unthinkable for the Green Party, the probable future coalition partner of Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democrats. The Greens have their roots in the antinuclear movement of the early 1980s: Resistance against nuclear power is in the party’s DNA. But so is the fight against climate change.",2020-01-08T07:00:05.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

The bombardment, which hit an industrial area outside the plant, severed the reactor’s connection to a 150-kilovolt backup line and forced into operation five diesel generators for about 90 minutes, the International Atomic Energy Agency said, but did not affect the unit’s core cooling. It was the second time in two weeks, the agency said, that electricity to that reactor had been interrupted. The plant must sometimes rely on lines connecting it to the power grid to provide electricity to cooling systems, and if those external lines are cut, as they have been several times in recent months because of shelling, engineers must turn to diesel generators. Even though it was forced to draw power from emergency sources only temporarily, the episode only reinforced how the facility, the largest in Europe, remains in a precarious state near the front lines, with the potential for fighting to cause a radiation leak of a nuclear meltdown always looming.",2022-10-07T21:22:16.000+02:00,NYTIMES,europe

But while the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which licenses reactors, and the power authority report that they are working hard to remedy problems at the 17-year-old plant, critics say that, good intentions notwithstanding, this plant -- like others in the country -- should be retired to make way for newer forms of energy. Leaders of environmental groups and a former inspector for the regulatory commission who oppose reopening Indian Point 3 cite the reactor's age, its poor marks for safety and performance in recent years and dangers posed by its proximity to the Ramapo Fault. ""It does not give one a sound sleep at night,"" said Barbara K. Hickernell, a spokeswoman for the Alliance to Close Indian Point, which represents local environmental organizations in Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties. ""It's going to take more than a matter of months to correct problems that have existed for years,"" she said. The alliance also seeks the closing of Indian Point 2 here, a nuclear plant run by the Consolidated Edison Company. Rule Violations Draw Fines In June, the 965-megawatt Indian Point 3 plant was placed on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's watch list of the 10 most troubled reactors in the country, after a series of unfavorable evaluations. Also, a performance review issued in July listed inadequate management controls -- among other things -- as part of the oversight commission's concerns for the plant. Since 1991 the New York Power Authority, the country's largest non-Federal public utility, has been fined $1.2 million for rule violations at both of its nuclear plants, Indian Point 3 and the James A. Fitzpatrick reactor in Scriba, N.Y., near Oswego, which was voluntarily shut down from November 1991 to January 1992 to correct various problems. The power authority owns 11 plants altogether -- 9 non-nuclear ones and 2 nuclear ones -- and supplies one-fourth of the state's electricity to government customers in Westchester and New York City and other jurisdictions like the Metropolitan Transit Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Seeking to allay the public's fears about a premature reopening of Indian Point 3, Curtis J. Cowgill, chief of the Northeast branch of the regulatory commission's reactor projects, said the plant will not be allowed to restart until his agency is satisfied that the problems leading to the shutdown have been remedied. John H. Garrity, resident manager of Indian Point 3 since April, said that despite the negative performance reviews, there has never been ""a degradation of safety"" at the plant. ""From an equipment point of view, the plant is in good shape,"" said Mr. Garrity, a former Tennessee Valley Authority project manager brought in to replace John C. Brons, who was reassigned as a consultant after the continuing problems at the plant, said Richard N. Flynn, chairman of the New York Power Authority. Mr. Garrity said there was a backlog of ""minor maintenance problems that sometimes took too long to get fixed because of the bureaucratic structure"" but no threat to the public's well-being. ""We're not talking about a Chernobyl kind of situation,"" he added, explaining that all reactors in the United States are designed to contain accidents and slow down operations in emergencies. Nevertheless, all of the problems that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission identified are still not solved, and since the voluntary shutdown in February, new problems have surfaced at Indian Point 3, Mr. Cowgill said. He said that since the shutdown, a valve misalignment caused a 1,000-gallon spill from a boric acid storage tank onto a floor in the plant. Also, workers discharged mildly radioactive water from the wrong tank into the Hudson River. The water was within regulatory standards, as was the water that should have been discharged, but both incidents indicated that operations were not being properly controlled, Mr. Cowgill said. On Tuesday, the N.R.C. informed the power authority that there were yet more violations at Indian Point 3 but did not impose new fines, saying the utility was working to resolve the problems. The latest notice of violation cited, among other things, the authority's failure to inspect and maintain emergency diesel generators, and it said that only two of five containment-fan units were operable from May 30, 1992, to March 7 this year. Indian Point 3, one of 109 operating plants in the country that are licensed by the N.R.C., is considered an average-size installation compared with newer plants like Palo Verde near Phoenix, which produces about 1,300 megawatts. One of the country's oldest plants, the Yankee Nuclear Power Plant in Rowe, Mass., produced 175 megawatts, but was shut down in 1991, after operating for 30 years, when questions arose about the stability of its reactor vessel. Called Earthquake Resistant Although critics worry about increasing equipment problems as Indian Point 3 ages, Diane Screnci, an N.R.C. spokeswoman, said the plant has a 40-year license to operate and is only ""approaching middle age."" And Mr. Cowgill said that although the reactor was built on the Ramapo Fault, it was designed to withstand the shock of a severe earthquake but not a devastating one. Assurances from the power authority and the Federal agency notwithstanding, Robert D. Pollard, a reactor engineer and a former N.R.C. licensing project manager whose duties included inspections, said the potential for problems that threaten the public's well-being persists at Indian Point 3. ""Any U.S. plant can have an accident with consequences as great or greater than Chernobyl,"" said Mr. Pollard, who now works for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit organization in Cambridge, Mass., which addresses arms control, energy and biotechnology issues. Waste Is Potent for 250,000 Years Mr. Pollard also said that power authorities and the nuclear industry in general ""are caught in a vise"" of trying to cut costs and balance safety needs. ""What I think is going on,"" he said, ""is that we have a problem of intense competition in the electrical-utility industry, and fixing safety problems costs money."" There are also other issues worrying critics. Fred Elmer, a founding member of the Hudson Alliance for Safe Energy, said he is concerned about the growing problem of radioactive waste, which research shows can in some cases remain potent for 250,000 years. Mr. Elmer -- whose recently formed grass-roots organization represents the Lower Hudson Chapter of the Sierra Club, Eco-Action and other groups -- said that even if ways are found to seal radioactive contaminants, the threat remains that they might be dislodged by natural events. Moreover, many members of environmental groups say the time has come to phase out nuclear reactors to make way for a post-cold war technology and renewable forms of energy like solar power and wind power. 'Cutting Butter With a Chain Saw' Mr. Elmer termed nuclear power overkill and said that the fuel components of reactors were heated to ""4,300 degrees Fahrenheit so we can boil water in our kitchens at 220 degrees."" Amory Lovins, a co-founder of the Rocky Mountain Institute in Snowmass, Colo., a nonprofit research and policy center, said that ""heating houses with electricity is like cutting butter with a chain saw."" There are already ""better and cheaper technologies on the market,"" he added, referring to solar power and wind power. In response to plant shutdowns and other concerns about nuclear energy, organizations like the Hudson Alliance for Safe Energy and the Alliance to Close Indian Point are proliferating nationwide, reported Scott Denman, executive director of the Safe Energy Communication Council in Washington. ""These grass-roots organizations are springing up out of fundamental and legitimate concerns about pocketbook, health and safety issues,"" said Mr. Denman, whose organization was founded in 1980 and represents 10 groups, including the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace. ""And as the current generation of plants continues to deteriorate, we will see even more such groups forming."" Management Report Awaited Meanwhile, Mr. Flynn, who is retiring on Feb. 1 as the Power Authority's chairman, said that in addition to changes at Indian Point 3, an independent nuclear advisory board -- made up of experts on nuclear-utility issues -- was providing advice and assistance to the authority on both of its nuclear plants. Mr. Flynn is stepping down from the post he has held for more than eight years to accept a position with the Northeast Corridor Initiative, a Boston-based organization working to develop a high-speed, electrified rail network. His resignation follows months of criticism over his use of a state airplane, allegations of poor management at the two nuclear power plants and questionable spending practices by the utility. Mr. Flynn termed the allegations ""basically unsubstantiated innuendo."" In Albany, David M. Egner, a spokesman for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, said a report was due later this month from a six-member committee appointed to review management at Indian Point 3 and at the Fitzpatrick plant.",1993-12-05T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region
03bce7db-6fa4-4ac3-8933-02a60d16ddec,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/business/westinghouse-toshiba-nuclear-bankruptcy.html,Bankruptcy Rocks Nuclear Industry,"Westinghouse Electric Company , which helped drive the development of nuclear energy and the electric grid itself, filed for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday, casting a shadow over the global nuclear industry. The filing comes as the company’s corporate parent, Toshiba of Japan, scrambles to stanch huge losses stemming from Westinghouse’s troubled nuclear construction projects in the American South. Now, the future of those projects, which once seemed to be on the leading edge of a renaissance for nuclear energy, is in doubt . “This is a fairly big and consequential deal,” said Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. “You’ve had some power companies and big utilities run into financial trouble, but this kind of thing hasn’t happened.” Westinghouse, a once-proud name that in years past symbolized America’s supremacy in nuclear power, now illustrates its problems. Many of the company’s injuries are self-inflicted, such as a disastrous deal for a construction business that was intended to control costs and instead precipitated the events that led to the filing on Wednesday. Over all, Toshiba has been widely criticized for overpaying for Westinghouse. But some of what went wrong was beyond either company’s control. Slowing demand for electricity and tumbling prices for natural gas have eroded the economic rationale for nuclear power, which is extremely costly and technically challenging to develop. Alternative-energy sources like wind and solar power are rapidly maturing and coming down in price. The 2011 earthquake in Japan that led to the nuclear disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi plant renewed worries about safety. Five years after an earthquake and tsunami devastated the northeast Japanese coast, Japan has not fully recovered. Westinghouse’s problems are already reducing Japan’s footprint in nuclear power, an industry it has nurtured for decades in the name of energy security. Even before the filing, Toshiba had essentially retired Westinghouse from the business of building nuclear power plants. Executives said they would instead focus on maintaining existing reactors — a more stable and reliably profitable business — and developing reactor designs. That has made the already small club of companies that take on the giant, expensive and complex task of nuclear-reactor building even smaller. General Electric, a pioneer in the field, has scaled back its nuclear operations, expressing doubt about their economic viability. Areva, the French builder, is mired in losses and undergoing a large-scale restructuring. Among the winners could be China, which has ambitions to turn its growing nuclear technical abilities into a major export . That has raised security concerns in some countries. The shrinking field is a challenge for the future of nuclear power, and for Toshiba’s revival plans. Its executives have said they would like to sell all or part of Westinghouse to a competitor, but with a dwindling list of potential buyers — combined with Westinghouse’s history of financial calamity — that has become a difficult task. Toshiba still faces tough questions. The company is also divesting its profitable semiconductor business and plans to sell a stake to an outside investor to raise capital. Most of the companies seen as possible buyers are from outside Japan. Some Japanese business leaders have expressed fears that the sale will further erode Japan’s place in an industry it once dominated. After writing down Westinghouse’s value, Toshiba said it expected to book a net loss of $9.9 billion for its current fiscal year, which ends on Friday. “We have all but completely pulled out of the nuclear business overseas,” Toshiba’s president, Satoshi Tsunakawa, said at a news conference. Of the huge loss, he added, “I feel great responsibility.” Bankruptcy will make it harder for Westinghouse’s business partners to collect money they are owed by the nuclear-plant maker. That mostly affects the American power companies for whom it is building reactors, analysts say. Now, it is unclear whether the company will be able to complete any of its projects, which in the United States are about three years late and billions over budget. The power companies — Scana Energy in South Carolina and a consortium in Georgia led by Georgia Power, a unit of Southern Company — would face the possibility of new contract terms, long lawsuits and absorbing losses that Toshiba and Westinghouse could not cover, analysts say. The cost estimates are already running $1 billion to $1.3 billion higher than originally expected, according to a recent report from Morgan Stanley, and could eventually exceed $8 billion over all. Dennis Pidherny, a managing director at Fitch Ratings who is sector head of the United States public power group, said that it was possible that the company’s bankruptcy filing could terminate the contracts and that it could be difficult for the utilities to find another builder to take them over. “There’s still quite a bit of work that needs to be completed,” he said. “The biggest challenge there is quite simply finding another suitable contractor who can complete the contract and have it completed at a quote-unquote reasonable cost.” That is, if they are constructed at all. Stan Wise, chairman of the Georgia Public Service Commission, said the utilities developing the Alvin W. Vogtle generating station in the state would have to evaluate whether it made sense to continue. “It’s a very serious issue for us and for the companies involved,” Mr. Wise said. “If, in fact, the company comes back to the commission asking for recertification, and at what cost, clearly the commission evaluates that versus natural gas or renewables.” In a statement on Wednesday, Toshiba said Westinghouse and affiliated companies were “working cooperatively” with the owners to arrange for construction to continue. In recent days, the affected companies issued statements saying they were monitoring the situation and exploring their options, as did the Energy Department, which has authorized $8.3 billion in federal loan guarantees for the Georgia project. “We are keenly interested in the bankruptcy proceedings and what they mean for taxpayers and the nation,” said Lindsey Geisler, a Department of Energy spokeswoman. “Our position with all parties has been consistent and clear: We expect the parties to honor their commitments and reach an agreement that protects taxpayers, promotes economic growth, and strengthens our energy and national security.” Toshiba said Westinghouse had total debt of $9.8 billion. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing was made in federal bankruptcy court for the Southern District of New York. A decade ago, Toshiba was dreaming of a big global expansion when it bought Westinghouse for a surprisingly high $5.4 billion and made plans to install 45 new reactors worldwide by 2030. At the same time, Westinghouse was trying to install a novel reactor design, the AP1000. Using simplified structures and safety equipment, it was intended to be easier and less expensive to install, operate and maintain. Its design also improves the ability to withstand earthquakes and plane crashes and is less vulnerable to a cutoff of electricity, which is what set off the triple meltdown at Fukushima. Nonetheless, it was inevitable that expansions at the Vogtle generating station in Georgia and the Virgil C. Summer plant in South Carolina would hit some bumps along the road to fruition, nuclear executives say. Not only was the design new, but, because nuclear construction had been dormant for so long, American companies also lacked the equipment and expertise needed to make some of the biggest components and construct the projects. Indeed, that may ultimately have been at the root of the troubles. The contractor Westinghouse chose to complete the projects struggled to meet the strict demands of nuclear construction and was undergoing its own internal difficulties after a merger. As part of an effort to get the delays and escalating costs under control, Westinghouse acquired part of the construction company, which set off a series of still-unresolved disputes over who should absorb the cost overruns and how Westinghouse accounted for and reported values in the transaction. In its bankruptcy filing, Westinghouse said that its top 30 unsecured creditors held over $508 million in claims. Among those creditors are big engineering and construction companies like Fluor and CB&I, and Nuclear Fuel Services, a fuel supplier. To shepherd its case through Chapter 11, Westinghouse has hired a number of advisers, including the investment bank PJT Partners, the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges, and the consulting firm AlixPartners. Westinghouse also said in its bankruptcy filing that it had taken out an $800 million loan from a group led by Citigroup to support itself through the bankruptcy process.",2017-03-29T11:31:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

It is too early to tell if the Feb. 9 accident at the Mihama Nuclear Power Plant, on the Japan Sea north of Kyoto, will derail plans to build two new power plants each year over the next two decades. But Goverment officials concede their efforts have been hindered by new accounts that suggest workers at the plant ignored repeated warning signals. Even while investigators examined the Mihama plant, three incidents occurred at other nuclear reactors around the country. None was classified as very serious, except one in which small amounts of radiation were released. Only sketchy details were available. Unusual Amount of Criticism But taken together, the incidents have prompted an unusual amount of criticism of the politically powerful nuclear industry here. Neighbors of the plants have protested that, despite Government assurances of a new openness on nuclear issues, they are not receiving early warnings of trouble or follow-up reports. And even many who accept Japan's official contention that the country's lack of natural resources leaves it no choice but to promote nuclear power have begun to question whether regulating nuclear energy should be entrusted to the same agencies that promote it. ""The fact that the country's nuclear energy policy has been marked by secrecy and disregard for public disclosure of information and data about nuclear power plants has helped increase the fears and suspicions of residents in the neighborhood of those plants,"" the Sanyo Shimbun, a local newspaper not far from the the site of the Mihama accident, wrote in an editorial recently. The actual damage at Mihama appears relatively small, though officials say the plant will be out of action for months. But the new details have cast suspicion on Japan's contention that catastrophic nuclear accidents are unlikely here -- the Government has put the chances at one in 100,000 -- because its nuclear workers are the world's best trained and its equipment the best maintained. The most damaging revelations came on Friday, when the Natural Resources and Energy Agency released the first comprehensive chronology of the accident. It showed that, 90 minutes before the emergency reached crisis proportions, workers were warned by a computer about an alarming increase in the level of the radiation in water circulating in the plant. Despite several subsequent warnings, the report shows, the workers kept operating the plant at maximum capacity. In pressurized water reactors like Mihama, a reactor based on designs that are widely used in the United States, the nuclear fuel in the core heats mildly radioactive water to tremendous temperatures and pumps it into thousands of small tubes in another container. There, the heat is transferred to pure water flowing over the outside of the tubes. The pure water turns into steam, which, in turn, drives a turbine to produce electricity. Tons of Tainted Water Released In the Mihama accident, one of the small tubes ruptured, spilling tons of contaminated water into pure water and steam. That led to a sudden drop in pressure in the water surrounding the nuclear core. The new report indicates that when workers finally did try to shut the reactor down at 1:48 P.M. -- significantly later than was orignally reported -- the plant was on the brink of disaster. Before the workers could shut the plant down, an emergency system automatically flooded the core of the reactor with cool water. While the system worked, the new report said that a few minutes later, two critical safety valves, designed to release pressure that was speeding the leak of radioactive water, failed to open. Fearful that the emergency cooling system would touch off new problems, the workers shut it off manually, a risky proceedure that Japanese officials say is not in their operation manual. Several newspapers have quoted plant workers who said that the coolant water was within a few degrees of boiling. If the water had actually boiled, the reactor fuel could have been seriously damaged. ""It is an issue we are still investigating,"" an official of the energy agency said recently. ""We don't know if there was damage or not."" Utilities Chafe at New Rules As questions about the accident mounted, the Government issued new rules a week ago requiring the country's 40 nuclear plants to shut down immediately if they see radiation levels are rising more than 20 percent. The ruling met strong resistance among electric utilities, which pride themselves on the fact that Japanese plants have 10 times fewer unplanned shutdowns each year than plants in the United States. On Friday the nation's power companies agreed to the new mandate. But company executives are complaining that anti-nuclear groups are using the incident to slow or stop the building of new plants. A senior executive of Kansai Electric Power Company, which operates Mihama, made a series of comments a week ago dismissing the importance of the accident, and contending it was being blown out of proportion. He was later forced to make a public apology.",1991-03-05T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,world

''I don't see how they could license Shoreham at this point,'' said Maurice Barbash, the Suffolk County builder who heads Citizens to Replace Lilco, an organization opposing both Shoreham and its owner, the Long Island Lighting Company. ''It would be the height of insanity.'' Scott Peters, a spokesman for the Atomic Industrial Forum, a nuclear-energy trade association, cautioned that reports of the Soviet accident remain sketchy. But he acknowledged that the accident ''is going to raise sensitivity about the safety issue.'' And Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who is the chairman of the Energy Conservation and Power subcommittee, predicted that the accident would have ''implications for all nuclear power plants, including Shoreham.'' Evacuation Plan Tested James Blew, director of Citizens for Shoreham Electricity, said that the Soviet accident was not relevant to the Shoreham debate, because of the fundamentally different safety standards in the two countries. ''But you've got to admit it may have an impact on public attitudes,'' he said. Until the Soviet disaster, the $4.5 billion plant appeared to be making steady progress toward getting a commercial operating license from the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Shoreham recently completed the last major stage in the license-application procedure, the testing of an emergency evacuation plan in case of a serious nuclear accident. But New York State and Suffolk County officials refused to participate in the drill, saying no emergency plan would work, given Long Island's dense population, restrictive geography and limited road network. ''Until now, the NRC and the utilities - Lilco in particular - have dealt with emergency planning as sort of a pointless exercise,'' Nora Bredes, executive coordinator of the Shoreham Opponents Coalition, said. ''What the Soviet tragedy says is that the worst can happen and any community that cannot offer that last fail-safe system should not have a nuclear plant in its midst.'' Public Mood Seen Shifting Even if the commission does grant Shoreham a license, that decision is sure to be challenged in the courts. And within that forum, said Charles Komanoff, a New York-based nuclear energy consultant, shifts in the public mood resulting from the Soviet disaster may have a more powerful impact. Lilco spokesmen and others stress differences in technology between American nuclear power plants and those in the Soviet Union. The containment structure at Shoreham is a 135-foot-high building of steel-reinforced concrete, between four feet and seven feet thick, enclosing the reactor. Reactors like the one at Shoreham differ from the damaged one in Chernobyl in the Ukraine in their use of water to control the chain reaction in the reactor. Unlike water, graphite can burn and there have been reports of a graphite fire at the Chernobyl plant.",1986-05-01T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,metropolitan-desk-new-york

Tsongas's support for nuclear power has thrust the issue into the center of the Presidential primary campaign for the first time in many years. But many people who follow the fortunes of the nuclear industry, which has been in sharp decline for a decade despite backing from the White House, say it may not make much difference who the President is. ""It sure is a manufactured issue,"" said Irwin Stelzer, an energy expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington research organization. ""You tell me who's going to build one? The utilities, the intelligent ones, are not pounding the table for the right to build nuclear plants."" Mr. Tsongas has been describing nuclear power as painful but in the long run essential. His campaign manifesto, ""An Economic Call to Arms,"" describes a world with dwindling fuel resources and rising pollution. ""Accepting this was excruciating,"" he wrote. ""Politically, it was all downside."" His Democratic opponents are trying to prove him right on that last remark. Bill Clinton attacked at a debate in Denver on Feb. 29, saying that Mr. Tsongas wanted to build ""hundreds more"" reactors. At present, 110 are operating. Mr. Tsongas replied, ""That is a lie, that is a lie, that is a lie."" Though part of Mr. Tsongas's strategy has been to cultivate an image as the candidate who dares to take unpopular but necessary positions, the Tsongas campaign recently issued a one-page statement, ""Setting the Record Straight,"" which states: ""He only favors research into whether smaller, safer, better-sited nuclear plants can be developed, if they are someday needed. And he hopes they are not."" According to the statement, Mr. Tsongas believes the choice may come to coal and nuclear ""and he is very concerned about the effect that massive reliance on coal would have on air quality and global warming."" A spokesman, Brad MacKenzie, said, ""The sound bite is, 'Pick your poison.' "" Ganging Up on Tsongas A Republican campaign official said that he doubted nuclear power would be much of an issue in the general election campaign ""unless there's some sort of Chernobyl."" But in the Democratic race, he said, ""more by fluke and happenstance than anything else, it's the one issue all four of them can gang up on Tsongas on."" Jerry Brown campaigned in Maine stressing his anti-nuclear record as governor of California, and Bob Kerrey also attacked Mr. Tsongas' position. Tom Harkin ran ads before the New Hampshire primary using the Seabrook plant as a backdrop and attacking Mr. Tsongas for supporting nuclear power. ""There is no such thing as a pro-nuclear environmentalist,"" he said in the ads. Nuclear power has angered millions of electricity customers because of its cost and made others uneasy over its safety. It has also won the backing of thousands of construction workers and scores of prominent engineers and scientists. But it is seldom more than mentioned in Presidential campaigns. In 1980, for example, the year after the Three Mile Island accident, Jimmy Carter, a former nuclear submarine officer who as President took several steps considered hostile to the industry, was opposed by Ronald Reagan, a former spokesman for a reactor maker, General Electric, and a supporter of the technology. But the topic barely surfaced. In the 1988 New Hampshire primary, the Seabrook reactor was a factor because Michael S. Dukakis, then governor of neighboring Massachusetts, was trying to prevent its opening. But the issue did not divide the Democrats. In fact, in the New York primary a few weeks later, all the Democratic candidates favored closing the Shoreham nuclear plant on Long Island. President Bush favored opening Seabrook and Shoreham, and John H. Sununu, his New Hampshire campaign manager and later White House chief of staff, was a force behind Seabrook's opening. But the question never became an important issue in the general election campaign. This year nuclear power is on Congress's agenda. The Senate voted last month to approve a simplified licensing system for new reactors, as part of President Bush's National Energy Strategy. The House bill has no such provision at the moment, however, so the issue may be a major point of contention in a major legislative package. Utilities do not seem to think that the fate of the industry will depend much on who is in the White House. John E. Lobbia, the chief executive of Detroit Edison, said, ""None of these guys has said that as a matter of national policy, we're going to go nuclear."" Executives in the nuclear industry say the talk on the campaign trail is mostly for show. ""Whatever the President says one way or the other doesn't seem to make a lot of difference,"" said James K. Asselstine, a utility analyst with Lehman Brothers and a former commissioner at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Whether new plants are built, he said, depends ""much more on the regulatory process and a whole series of issues that go to economics."" At the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, the nuclear industry's public relations arm, Carl Goldstein, a spokesman, agreed. ""Substantively, we're at the whim of a lot of things other than who's in the White House."" All the President, does, he said, is ""set the tone."" ""It'll fade once the primaries are over,"" he said. While other Democrats may attack Mr. Tsongas, he continued, ""I don't think it has any resonance among the voters.""

If passed by the House, the bill would make a tenfold increase in the statutory cap on compensation payments by nuclear utilities to people injured in a commercial reactor accident. Each nuclear power company would be required to make a pro-rated money commitment to an industrywide liability pool that would cover claims, up to the statutory limit, against member corporations. But under a system of ''retrospective premiums,'' the utilities would pay no insurance costs unless there was an accident. The increase in the liability limit was called ''totally unacceptable'' by an industry spokesman, John J. Kearney, vice president of the Edison Electric Institute. The committee's action, on a revision of the Price-Anderson Act of 1957, which currently limits the nuclear power industry to a pooled liability of $660 million per accident, was a last-minute compromise hammered out behind closed doors this morning before the committee met. The nuclear industry had lobbied hard for a ceiling no higher than $2 billion. Committee Democrats, led by the chairman, Representative Morris K. Udall of Arizona, had pressed for an increase in the liability ceiling to $8.2 billion for an accident, and last month in a preliminary vote of 21 to 20 they appeared to have won it. Amid the increased lobbying for and against the lower industry-backed cap that followed the Soviet nuclear accident at Chernobyl on April 26, the committee postponed a final vote scheduled for April 30. In the negotiated compromise approved by voice vote today, backers of the most strenuous industry accountability were forced to yield on several points.",1986-05-22T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,national-desk-u.s.

Iranian news outlets reported that Iraqi warplanes raided an unfinished Iranian nuclear power plant today, and that an Iranian nuclear official said the attack could lead to a release of radiation across international borders. Iraq announced it had raided a chemical complex at Bushire, near the site, but did not announce any attack on the nuclear plant. Iran's official press agency, monitored in Cyprus, quoted the energy official, Reza Amrollahi, as saying the plant contained nuclear material. The raid might lead to ''the same transfrontier radioactive release and radiological consequences as the Chernobyl nuclear accident,'' he said, referring to the Soviet disaster in 1986. There was no independent confirmation of a raid on the nuclear plant or of the presence of nuclear material at the site, which had been bombed at least five times since 1984. U.S. Experts Discount Threat In Washington, American nuclear experts said the reported bombing could not produce a Chernobyl-like disaster. Gary Milhollin, a University of Wisconsin law professor and former Pentagon nuclear consultant, said Iran's two reactors at Bushire ''are not complete, so they do not have any high level radioactive material in them.'' He said the Iranians ''could have put fresh reactor fuel in it, if they had some, but unless the reactor is operating, it does not create the kind of radioactivity that is dangerous to health.'' ''The dangerous materials from Chernobyl were products of the fission reaction, which occurs when a reactor operates,'' he said. Dan Butler, a Department of Energy spokesman, said: ''There is no reactor in Iran. I've checked with three sources.'' None of the experts said they had any reports of radioactivity from the site. Construction at the plant, which was begun under the Shah, was interrupted in 1979, when the Islamic fundamentalist regime took power in Teheran. Iran Reports 11 Killed Iran said 11 people were killed in the raid today. The Iranian news agency said that Mr. Amrollahi, president of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, had sent an ''urgent protest note'' to Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, asking him to rush a team of experts to the scene to monitor the effects of the raid. In Vienna, a spokesman for the energy agency said he knew nothing about a request for such a team. But the spokesman, James Daglish, said an Iranian representative was seeking a meeting with Mr. Blix. No one answered the telephone at the Iranian mission there. Iraq said in a military communique that its jets had conducted two raids against ''the Iranian industrial and chemical production complex at Bushire,'' 37 miles from the nuclear installation. An Iraqi News Agency broadcast hinted that the industrial complex was engaged in making and storing chemical weapons. Iran said last year that it had moved ''fissionable material'' into the plant and warned an attack could set off another Chernobyl disaster. The explosion and fire at the Soviet nuclear plant in April 1986 killed 31 people and sent a cloud of radioactive material around the world. Officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency said earlier that they could not confirm the assertion about fissionable material because no on-site inspection had been made. The Teheran radio said that among the 11 killed at the unfinished plant were ''one of the plant's top nuclear power experts'' and a West German engineer.",1987-11-18T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,world

Semnani and Gary M. Sandquist (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Jan. 3): Iran’s nuclear safety regulations ensure that nuclear facilities are designed in accordance with the latest state-of-the-art technology and without undue risk to the health and safety of their personnel, public, next generations and the environment, during construction, commissioning, operation and decommissioning stages of nuclear facilities. Accordingly, application of the highest safety standards has always been and continues to be the first priority in design, construction and operation of the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Over the past several years, the International Atomic Energy Agency has sent about a dozen missions to the Islamic Republic of Iran to address various aspects of the plant’s safety. Before the plant began operation, an international team of nuclear safety experts led by the agency paid a visit to the plant and also reviewed the effectiveness of its safety regulations. After extensive investigation, the agency found that Bushehr enjoys the safety standards analogous to other modern and advanced nuclear power plants worldwide. Considering the fact that the responsibility for nuclear safety rests exclusively with the individual states, Iran is fully committed to the application of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s safety standards in all its nuclear facilities, including Bushehr. Iran has also started the internal legal procedure to accede to the Convention on Nuclear Safety.

Kintner, who played a role in early efforts to harness nuclear power and later witnessed its destructive potential while heading the decontamination of the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant after a partial meltdown, died on May 7 in Exeter, N.H. He was 90. Mr. Kintner had prostate cancer, his son Eric said. After World War II, Mr. Kintner helped develop a reactor for the Navy that was later used in the first nuclear-powered submarine, the Nautilus. “To produce Nautilus, it was necessary to expand man’s knowledge far beyond the ‘known’ in almost every technical area — physics, metallurgy, mechanical engineering, electronics, environmental medicine,” Mr. Kintner wrote in an article in The New York Times Magazine in 1965, shortly after the 10th anniversary of the submarine’s maiden voyage on Jan. 17, 1955. Mr. Kintner went on to a wide-ranging career in military and civilian energy. He worked for the Atomic Energy Commission and was head of the Department of Energy’s fusion program, overseeing the construction of reactors and developing nuclear power as an alternate source of energy. When the core of the reactor melted down at the Three Mile Island plant near Harrisburg, Pa., in March 1979, an event that severely set back the development of nuclear power plants, Mr. Kintner was named to oversee the cleanup. Edwin Earl Kintner was born in Paris, Ohio, on May 1, 1920. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1941 and later earned master’s degrees in naval construction, ocean engineering and physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1949, Mr. Kintner was selected by Vice Adm. Hyman G. Rickover, who was then a captain and later became known as the father of the nuclear Navy, to work on the Nautilus, a secret project. Mr. Kintner helped build sister vessels for the Navy until he retired in the early 1960s at the rank of captain. In the 1970s, when gasoline prices were rising sharply, Mr. Kintner led a project to explore ways to use nuclear fusion to replace oil. But he stepped down in 1982, complaining that the federal government had not provided the resources needed for the research. In his resignation letter, he said the Reagan administration was making “a national error for which a price far greater than present savings will be paid at some future date.” In 1983, he became executive vice president of General Public Utilities Nuclear Corporation, the owner of Three Mile Island, in charge of finishing the cleanup of its reactor. “It is a symbol that we have this beast by the throat,” Mr. Kintner told The New York Times in 1984, describing his strategy to avert future hazards. In the accident’s wake, Mr. Kintner worked to standardize nuclear training and operation and, in 1990, he was inducted to the National Academy of Engineering. Besides his son Eric, of Westford, Mass., he is survived by his wife, Alice, of Exeter, N.H.; two other sons, John, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Peter, of Park City, Utah; and a daughter, Mary, of Underhill, Vt.",2010-05-20T21:11:33.000+02:00,NYTIMES,national-science

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has disclosed that an employee of a long-delayed nuclear power plant southeast of here was dismissed suddenly three months ago after trying to report safety problems to Federal officials. The commission is demanding an explanation. The dismissal, by the TU Electric Company, the utility that owns the plant, occurred in November but was first made public Thursday in the regulatory commission's report of its investigation into the episode. TU Electric responded today by saying that the employee, who has not been identified except as a quality control inspector at the Camanche Peak nuclear power plant, had been discharged as part of a layoff of 4,000 of the utility's workers. In its report, the commission said TU Electric had discharged the inspector a day after he had tried to document and report Camanche Peak's receipt of damaged insulation material from a contractor. The commission said that it had not been able to prove that the inspector was laid off for vindictive reasons but added that it had asked the utility to account for its actions at a private hearing to be held in Washington on Feb. 7. Dismissal of whistleblowers in the nuclear power industry is illegal under the Atomic Energy Act.

No radiation had leaked from the No. 1 Reactor at the Oi Nuclear Power Plant, on the Japan Sea coast, about 250 miles west of Tokyo, said Yoshihiko Kondo, a spokesman for the plant’s operator, Kansai Electric Power . Mr. Kondo said that a loss of pressure had been detected late Friday in an accumulator tank needed to cool the reactor core in an emergency, forcing the utility to shut down the reactor. Workers will begin the shutdown at 1 p.m. Saturday in Japan, and shutdown will be complete by 9 p.m., he said. The shutdown at Oi just four months after the devastating accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant comes as a blow to an industry struggling to regain public confidence. It also worsens an electricity shortage that has forced several utilities in Japan to require companies to reduce their use by at least 15 percent. Only 19 of Japan’s 54 nuclear reactors are operating, because units shut down for regular maintenance have not been given permission by local governments to restart after the disaster at Fukushima, operated by Japan’s largest nuclear operator, Tokyo Electric Power. In the meantime, more reactors have been closing for scheduled maintenance, reducing the number in service across the country. The 1.17-million-kilowatt Oi No. 1 Reactor, built in 1979, had been in the last stages of a trial run at full output after undergoing scheduled maintenance this year.

For both foes and advocates of the Shoreham nuclear power plant, this has been a puzzling month. In what would appear to be a victory for opponents, a state appeals court ruled that the Long Island Lighting Company, Shoreham's owner, has no legal authority to put into effect its emergency evacuation plan for the plant without the participation of local governments. Since both New York State and Suffolk County have refused to have anything to do with Shoreham, Lilco would appear to lack a workable emergency plan. Such a plan is required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commisssion for any United States nuclear plant. Only a few days earlier, however, the commission had disclosed that it is considering waiving its requirement that local governments participate in emergency planning. If the Federal agency took that step, the state court decision would appear to be irrelevant. How this is resolved will affect not only Shoreham, but also the future of the nuclear industry in the United States. A central issue emerging from the conflict is the division of powers between the states and the Federal Government in regard to nuclear energy and safety, an issue that increasingly appears headed for resolution at the highest level, the Supreme Court. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission began requiring evacuation plans for a 10-mile radius around nuclear plants after the accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979. As public opinion on Long Island turned strongly against the opening of Shoreham, however, New York State and Suffolk County officials withheld their cooperation. When Lilco rehearsed its emergency plan a year ago without them, the officials contended that without their participation, the plan could not assure public safety. Lilco executives argue that it would be ludicrous to refuse Shoreham a license on that basis. Open the plant, they say, and no official will refuse to prepare for a crisis. Although a spokesman for the N.R.C., Frank Ingram, would say only, ''We can't foretell which way things will go,'' members of the agency appear to be facing three uncomfortable options. Local Veto Power If they agree that the refusal of Suffolk County and the state to participate is a ground for denying a license, they will in effect be granting local governments veto power over nuclear plants within their communities. ''Nuclear policy is supposed to be regulated on a national basis, not by states and counties,'' said Scott Peters, a spokesman for the Atomic Industrial Forum, an industry trade group. ''The rule on evacuation plans was never intended to give that power away.'' The commission's second option - to issue a license under existing regulations, but in the absence of local government participation -would open the agency to the charge that it was violating its own safeguards under pressure from the nuclear industry, the Department of Energy and others. ''The N.R.C.'s responsibility is safety, not to guarantee that Lilco's investment will pay off,'' said Diane Kern, a lawyer retained by the Union of Concerned Scientists, a watchdog group. But William O. Doub, a former Atomic Energy Commissioner now practicing law in Washington, countered: ''People like me are always reluctant to talk about safety and economics in the same discussion. It gives the uninformed the impression we're willing to sacrifice safety for money, which isn't true. But you do have to be realistic about what it means to scrap billions of dollars worth of hardware.'' Shoreham has cost $4.6 billion and interest charges are piling up at about $2 million a day. That leaves the third choice now under consideration: rewriting the emergency-plan regulations so that local participation is no longer required. But here, too, the agency is vulnerable to criticism. ''As a practical matter, it would be the functional equivalent of having no evacuation planning,'' said Robert Pollard, a former commission employee who is now an engineer for the Union of Concerned Scientists. A hearing has been scheduled for Monday in Washington on the proposed regulation change. In the coming months there will be hearings on last year's evacuation exercise and other matters related to Shoreham's opening. A new state entity, the Long Island Power Authority, is examining the possibility of buying Lilco and shutting Shoreham. Before taking such a step, however, the new authority would have to determine that the move would not increase the price of electricity. Congress could become more directly involved in the debate. Previous Congressional instructions to the N.R.C. have called for retaining Federal control over nuclear policy. But a bill proposed by Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, would allow a governor to block plant licenses if state officials believe safe evacuation of the surrounding area is impossible. Key figures in the debate, however, are now convinced that Shoreham's fate will be decided in the Supreme Court. ''Assuming no change in position by anyone,'' said William Briggs, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's solicitor, ''that's where it's heading.'' In addition to deciding whether Shoreham should open, the court is likely to be called upon to determine which level of government, under the Constitution, is entitled to exercise authority over nuclear power, health and safety - a question that could well be among the thorniest Federal-state conflicts of this generation.

What actions exactly? Activists hope for answers from the coming United Nations climate conference in Paris, which begins Monday. They should look instead to Washington today. The single most important action we can take is thawing a nuclear energy policy that keeps our technology frozen in time. If we are serious about replacing fossil fuels, we are going to need nuclear power, so the choice is stark: We can keep on merely talking about a carbon-free world, or we can go ahead and create one. We already know that today’s energy sources cannot sustain a future we want to live in. This is most obvious in poor countries, where billions dream of living like Americans. The easiest way to satisfy this demand for a better life has been to burn more coal: In the past decade alone, China added more coal-burning capacity than America has ever had. But even though average Indians and Chinese use less than 30 percent as much electricity as Americans, the air they breathe is far worse. They deserve a third option besides dire poverty or dirty skies. In America, the left worries more about our five billion metric tons of annual carbon dioxide emissions and what it might do to Earth’s climate. On the right, even those who discount the environmental effects of fossil fuels can’t deny their contribution to economic volatility. We saw this in 2008 when a historic high oil price coincided with a historic financial crisis. The need for energy alternatives was already clear to investors a decade ago, which is why they poured funding into clean technology during the early 2000s. But while the money was there, the technology wasn’t: The result was a series of bankruptcies and the scandal of Solyndra, the solar panel manufacturer in California that went bankrupt in 2011 after receiving a federal guarantee of hundreds of millions of dollars. Wind and solar together provide less than 2 percent of the world’s energy, and they aren’t growing anywhere near fast enough to replace fossil fuels. What’s especially strange about the failed push for renewables is that we already had a practical plan back in the 1960s to become fully carbon-free without any need of wind or solar: nuclear power. But after years of cost overruns, technical challenges and the bizarre coincidence of an accident at Three Mile Island and the 1979 release of the Hollywood horror movie “The China Syndrome,” about a hundred proposed reactors were canceled. If we had kept building, our power grid could have been carbon-free years ago. Instead, we went in reverse. In 1984, Ohio’s nearly finished William H. Zimmer nuclear plant was abruptly converted into a coal-burning facility: a microcosm of the country’s lurch back toward carbon. The 2011 Fukushima disaster seemed at first to confirm old fears: Nearly 16,000 people were killed by the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. But nobody in Japan died from radiation, and in 2013 United Nations researchers predicted that “no discernible increased incidence of radiation-related health effects are expected.” Critics often point to the Chernobyl accident in the Soviet Union as an even more terrifying warning against nuclear power, but that accident was a direct result of both a faulty design and the operators’ incompetence. Fewer than 50 people were reported to have died at Chernobyl; by contrast, the American Lung Association estimates that smoke from coal-fired power plants kills about 13,000 people every year. Only recently has climate anxiety challenged nuclear fear. Just as the impact of coal smoke dwarfs the effects of radiation from Fukushima, global warming is predicted to be far worse than mere pollution. The problem is so big that some prominent environmentalists have already declared defeat. But not everyone has been paralyzed. While politicians prepare a grand bargain on emissions limits that future politicians are unlikely to obey, a new generation of American nuclear scientists has produced designs for better reactors. Crucially, these new designs may finally overcome the most fundamental obstacle to the success of nuclear power: high cost. Designs using molten salt, alternative fuels and small modular reactors have all attracted interest not just from academics but also from entrepreneurs and venture capitalists like me ready to put money behind nuclear power. However, none of these new designs can benefit the real world without a path to regulatory approval, and today’s regulations are tailored for traditional reactors, making it almost impossible to commercialize new ones. Fortunately, we have solved this problem before. In 1949 the federal government built a test facility at Idaho National Laboratory to study and evaluate new nuclear reactor designs. We owe our nuclear power industry to the foresight of those New Dealers, and we need their openness to innovation again today. Earlier this year, the House of Representatives passed a bill calling for reform of our national laboratories; recently, the White House hosted a summit meeting to support nuclear energy. However, now that the speeches are over, we still lack a plan to fund and prototype the new reactors that we badly need. Both the right’s fear of government and the left’s fear of technology have jointly stunted our nuclear energy policy, but on this issue liberals hold the balance of power. Speaking about climate change in 2013, President Obama said that our grandchildren will ask whether we did “all that we could when we had the chance to deal with this problem.” So far, the answer would have to be no — unless he seizes this moment.

Just as surprising was the response of the plant’s operator, the Chubu Electric Power Company . It hemmed and hawed and dragged its feet for three days before finally accepting the prime minister’s request on Monday. This test of wills over the weekend pitted Japan’s leader against one of its most entrenched and coddled interest groups, a nuclear power industry that retains enormous clout even after the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. While Mr. Kan prevailed, experts say the delay in his decision to shut the plant, and the company’s subsequent indecision over whether to follow his recommendation, underscore the obstacles to decisive leadership in Japan’s consensus-driven political culture. Some experts go a step further, saying that the clash over the fate of the Hamaoka plant, which was built on a fault, reflects a breakdown in the old consensus that long served the needs of a nation in times of stable economic growth, but has worked less well in times of crisis. “The old consensus model between government and business has broken down,” said Michael Auslin, director of Japan studies at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. “Everyone is looking out for their own self-interest.” “The old way of doing things has broken down, but there is not yet a new way to take its place,” Mr. Auslin said. This breakdown is the product of the slow disintegration of Japan Inc.’s unity during years of national stagnation, culminating in the 2009 election victory of Mr. Kan’s Democratic Party, which ended a half-century of virtual one-party rule in Japan. Democrats have challenged Japan’s sclerotic postwar order, but have struggled to build trust with the nation’s powerful business world. Mistrust of the Kan government deepened during the nuclear crisis, when Tokyo often appeared indecisive in its response, and inconsistent in its release of information. Moreover, Mr. Kan is challenging the nuclear industry, which held a privileged and protected place as Japan made its postwar march to economic development. The need for energy in this resource-poor nation overrode safety and environmental concerns. Strong collusive bonds were built between the industry and regulators by the practice of “amakudari,” or “ descent from heaven,” in which retired government officials received comfortable jobs at the companies they regulated. “Nuclear power plants were long treated as sacred territory,” said Katsuhiko Ishibashi, a seismologist and nuclear safety expert at Kobe University who has long argued for tougher quake resistance standards at the country’s nuclear facilities. “The accident at Fukushima Daiichi is at last starting to change that.” But not quickly. The clash with Chubu, the operator of the Hamaoka plant, underscores the slow pace of decision making and the reluctance of powerful companies — even in a period of crisis — to bend to directives from politicians who they feel may not understand the issues at stake. One of the biggest complaints against Mr. Kan is that he made a quick decision without taking the time to do “nemawashi,” the time-consuming process of visiting concerned parties ahead of time to work out a compromise that all could agree on. Prime Minister Kan had been “undeniably abrupt,” said Hiromasa Yonekura, chairman of Japan’s most powerful business lobby, the Japan Business Federation, known here as the Keidanren. “What I don’t understand about the Democratic Party era is that they reach decisions just like that,” Mr. Yonekura said at a news conference on Monday. “Publicizing his own opinions first, then explaining to Chubu Electric later is nothing more than a political performance. These sort of decisions should have been debated first.” Hamaoka is in many ways a symbol of nuclear power’s protected status. While the plant has faced years of lawsuits seeking its suspension because of its precarious location, Japan’s compliant courts have consistently ruled in the industry’s favor. Nuclear safety experts have long warned of the dangers posed by the Hamaoka plant, which lies in an area riddled with known fault lines about 120 miles southwest of Tokyo. The government’s own experts have estimated that there is close to a 90 percent chance of an earthquake of about magnitude 8.0 hitting the area within the next 30 years. Board members at Chubu Electric Power at first failed to reach a decision at a meeting on Saturday, a day after Naoto Kan, Japan’s prime minister, publicly called on the operator to close the plant until major safety improvements could be made to protect against quake and tsunami risks in the region. Local reports said that executives had debated the financial losses that would result from closing the facility, as well as the power shortages that might result from losing a major source of energy in the region. The decision to adhere to the government’s request was “agonizing” for the company, Akihisa Mizuno, president of Chubu Electric, said at a news conference on Monday. “The request from the prime minister is one that carries a lot of weight, and which is based on growing public concern over nuclear power in the wake of the serious accident at Fukushima,” Mr. Mizuno told reporters. “We are prepared to put into place safety measures to strengthen our defenses against tsunamis,” Mr. Mizuno said. “We believe this is the only way we can regain the trust of the local community, and of wider society.” Two reactors at the plant will be closed, while a third, already shut down for scheduled inspections, will remain off-line, Mr. Mizuno said. Two older reactors at the plant were decommissioned in 2009. But in a show of defiance, Mr. Mizuno said the utility had asked the government for assistance “to help avoid or lessen” the impact on its shareholders. Mr. Kan has sought to appease the nuclear power industry by assuring that he will not demand the closing of other nuclear facilities in Japan. The country remains committed to nuclear energy use , the prime minister told reporters on Sunday. The trade minister, Banri Kaieda, also sought to smooth over ties with the industry on Monday, praising Chubu Electric for its decision to close the plant. “I know that Chubu Electric faced a lot of difficulties,” Mr. Kaieda said at a news conference. “I deeply respect its swift handling of the matter.”",2011-05-09T18:32:08.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific
ab94dce1-31a1-4411-8a19-1ec2b268cc75,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/16/world/asia/japan-shelves-plan-to-slash-emissions-citing-fukushima.html,"Japan Backs Off From Emissions Targets, Citing Fukushima Disaster","TOKYO — Japan took a major step back on Friday from earlier pledges to slash its greenhouse gas emissions, saying a shutdown of its nuclear power plants in the wake of the Fukushima disaster had made previous targets unattainable. The announcement cast a shadow over international talks underway in Warsaw aimed at fashioning a new global pact to address the threats of a changing climate. Under its new goal, Japan, one of the world’s top polluters, would still seek to reduce its current emissions. But it would release 3 percent more greenhouse gases in 2020 than it did in 1990, rather than the 6 percent cut it originally promised or the 25 percent reduction it promised two years before the 2011 nuclear disaster. The new target, however, is based on Japan’s never turning on any of its scores of idled plants, despite the government’s continued push to bring many of them back online. Highlighting the increased emissions that would result from staying nuclear free — and perhaps securing the backing of climate-change advocates — could allow the conservative government to strengthen the case to its own public that nuclear power is necessary. Japan’s environment minister, Nobuteru Ishihara, said that the new target “does not consider the possible effect of nuclear power plants reducing emissions” and that Japan “would set a more definite target” once it settled on what sources of energy it would use in the future. Environmental groups attending the climate talks criticized Japan’s new targets and said reducing emissions and keeping the country’s reactors offline were not mutually exclusive. “Japan can get dramatic emission reductions while shutting down nuclear entirely,” said Martin Kaiser, head of the Greenpeace delegation. Greenpeace said its own calculations showed Japan could achieve emissions cuts of more than 20 percent without relying on nuclear power if it more aggressively pursued renewable energy. Since the 2011 disaster, Japan’s nuclear power program, which had provided about 30 percent of the country’s electricity, has ground to a halt amid public anxiety over safety, and the country has had to fill much of the gap by burning fossil fuels. The current government has been trying for months to get the public consensus it would like before turning some reactors back on, but so far its assurances that new, tighter regulations will keep the plants safe have not convinced many Japanese. And though Japan’s largest business lobby has argued, along with the government, that energy-poor Japan needs nuclear power to bring down energy costs, opposition to bringing reactors online remains strong. Higher-than-expected emissions from Japan would be a major setback in the fight against global warming. The announcement added to concerns in Warsaw about the difficulty in reducing the atmospheric pollution that many scientists say makes extreme weather events, possibly including the devastating typhoon that hit the Philippines last week, more severe and more frequent. Climate negotiations have been moving very slowly since a meeting in Copenhagen in 2009 that ended in acrimony after the United States and rapidly developing countries like China were unable to come to terms on how to allocate responsibility. The Warsaw conference has adopted a narrow goal of creating a road map for replacing the Kyoto Protocol, which technically expired last year, and to address the thorny issues of how poor countries should be compensated for the costs of adapting to climate change. “There is regret about the announcement from Japan,” Christiana Figueres, leader of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , the body overseeing the Warsaw talks, said at a news conference. But she added that Japan had made significant strides in energy efficiency and renewable power, and said she hoped that the new target would prove conservative. In an apparent bid to deflect criticism of its new target, Japan said it would provide about $16 billion in private and public funds through 2015 to help developing countries curb their greenhouse gas emissions. While Japan’s surprisingly modest plan was an unwelcome development to climate delegates, it was just one of many indications that negotiators would have a difficult time arranging anything beyond a cosmetic deal in Warsaw. It came just two days after Australia’s new conservative government introduced a bill in Parliament to repeal the carbon tax enacted by its Labor predecessor. Signatories to the United Nations treaty agreed in 2010 to cut greenhouse gas emissions to hold the rise in global temperatures to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 2 degrees Celsius, above preindustrial levels — the most scientists say the earth can tolerate before the effects of global warming become vastly more pernicious. Backtracking by Japan and Australia on emissions, as well as efforts by the United States and China that some criticize as too weak, would not bode well for reaching the temperature target. More broadly, Japan’s action shows the crucial role that many experts say nuclear power must play if the world has any chance of reaching its emissions goals. Just two weeks ago, four prominent climate scientists wrote an open letter calling for environmental groups to embrace nuclear power as the only hope to head off catastrophic global warming. “Energy demand is going to increase,” Stuart Neil, senior director of external relations and communications for the World Energy Council , an alliance of governments, corporations and energy activists, said Friday by telephone from Warsaw. “We need to look at that in a sustainable way. But the reality is that we’re looking at a doubling of demand by 2050,” with most growth outside the developed world. In 2011, Japan was the world’s fifth-biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, after China, the United States, India and Russia. Together, these countries and the European Union account for about 70 percent of total global carbon dioxide emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States. Japan had been a laggard in pursuing renewable energy, choosing instead to rely on its reactors to pare back greenhouse emissions. Before the accident, less than 3 percent of the electricity Japan generated came from renewable energy sources, excluding hydropower. The energy shortfall resulting from the closing of its nuclear plants has left Japan scrambling to fire up old coal- and gas-powered stations, and ramp up its imports of fossil fuels. In the year through March, Japan released the equivalent of 1.2 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, more than 7 percent higher than the year preceding the nuclear accident and 14 percent higher than levels in 1990. To kick-start its renewable power program, Japan introduced incentives to diversify its energy sources last year. In the program’s first 12 months, through June, the country added renewable power equal to the output of about four nuclear reactors. Japan’s new target assumes that the country will achieve energy savings of about 20 percent by investing in renewable energy sources and energy-efficient technology, Mr. Ishihara said. Japan seeks to reduce emissions from 2005 levels by 3.8 percent, he said. Japan’s nuclear reactors around the country were shut down for regular maintenance after the disaster at Fukushima Daiichi spewed radioactive materials over northeastern Japan, but the government did not count on the antinuclear feelings that greeted its attempts to try to restart them.",2013-11-15T12:22:18.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The shipments, scheduled to begin next year, would be the first large-scale commercial shipments of spent fuel from American nuclear power plants overseas, and they have prompted fears from opponents that the precedent could eventually contribute to the spread of plutonium, an essential ingredient in nuclear weapons. The plan to ship 100 tons of all-but-new fuel -- it was used for the equivalent of two full days while the plant was being tested -- is one of the last acts in the troubled history of the $5.5 billion power plant, and like everything that came before it at Shoreham, the plan is not without controversy. Reprocessing the fuel at a plant in La Hague in Normandy was the most expensive of several options considered by the staff of the Long Island Power Authority, the state agency charged with decommissioning the plant and cleaning up the site. At a news conference, Richard M. Kessel, the authority's chairman, said the overseas shipment was the quickest way to get the radioactive fuel off Long Island, and the choice with the least uncertainty and least financial and physical risk. He said the authority might recover $10 million of the $74 million it will pay to get rid of the fuel from the resale of the reprocessed fuel. Utility customers will pay for the disposal of the fuel, but Mr. Kessel said he hoped to cover much of the cost through savings in other parts of the plant's closing. ""We want to end the Shoreham story here on Long Island,"" Mr. Kessel said, as he sketched out a plan to be put to a formal vote by the authority's board on Monday. ""If there were another choice without danger and without economic threat to the people on Long Island, we would do that."" But others urged that the decision be put off and that the fuel be kept on the Island while less costly options and those with less risk of nuclear proliferation are explored. ""They seem to be giving the spent fuel the bum's rush -- let's get it out of sight and out of mind,"" said Paul Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, a private group that is seeking to slow the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The group, supported by several other environmental and scientific groups, including the Friends of the Earth, and the Union of Concerned Scientists, has opposed an application pending before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to export the fuel, in the form of 560 uranium rods, to France. Fear of Loss The Shoreham fuel contains little plutonium -- a little more than 10 pounds, slightly less than the amount needed for one bomb the size of the one dropped on Nagasaki. But critics said that shipping it to France would set a precedent for the export of fuel rods from other reactors with far higher concentrations of plutonium. They fear that the separation of the plutonium will increase the chance that some of it will be lost or stolen and speed the spread of nuclear weapons. At the same time, the Long Island Lighting Company, which built Shoreham, but has no say now on what happens to the fuel rods, questioned whether the costs were justified. Joseph W. McDonnell, a spokesman for the utility, said that it had estimated that it would cost as little as $23 million to store the fuel on the Shoreham site for 40 years, a move that could save electric customers perhaps $4 million a year on their electric bills. The Long Island Power Authority, using more expensive assumptions, including large reserves for contingencies, put the cost of fuel storage at the Shoreham site at $66 million over 40 years. Years of Wrangling Asked about the Lilco estimate, Mr. Kessel said it was ""about as accurate as their initial estimate of the cost of Shoreham, $266 million."" Eventually the official cost of the plant rose to $5.5 billion. The authority paid $1 for the plant earlier this year, after years of wrangling over the safety and economic viability of the plant, and began taking it apart, in the first demolition of a completed nuclear power plant.",1992-11-26T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Asserting that the Shoreham nuclear power plant has become a symbol of the country's commitment to nuclear energy, a top Federal energy official told Long Island business leaders today that the Bush Administration would do everything in its power to prevent the plant from being dismantled. ''The Energy Department will do everything it can to prevent the senseless, needless destruction of what we perceive to be a state-of-the-art nuclear power plant,'' the official, Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore, said in a speech at a country club here. Ever since the Long Island Lighting Company and New York State worked out a deal under which the utility would sell the plant to the state, which would then dismantle it, Bush Administration officials have criticized the agreement as wasteful and shortsighted. In April, the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted a full operating license to Shoreham, but the plant has never been opened. Approval Expected Mr. Moore's remarks today came two weeks before Lilco shareholders are to vote on the agreement to transfer the plant. He said that he expected the shareholders to approve the agreement but that the Energy Department would then ''oppose very forcefully the transferring of that license.'' The Administration favors mothballing the plant so that it could be opened in the future if Long Islanders changed their minds. In his speech, Mr. Moore said the benefits of Shoreham included improved electricity capacity and better rates for Long Island. Most of those in the audience for the session, sponsored by the Long Island Association and the Association for a Better Long Island, were supportive of Mr. Moore's remarks. But a small band of protesters stood outside. After the speech, state officials assailed the official's remarks and accused the Federal Government of meddling in the Island's affairs, especially at this late stage when a settlement agreement has finally been reached. 'An Ailing Industry' ''Instead of trying to shove Shoreham down Long Island's collective throat, he ought to spend more time dealing with the problems his agency faces at Department of Energy facilities,'' said Richard M. Kessel, executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board. ''They're trying to make Shoreham the national bellwether of nuclear power, to use it to resuscitate an ailing industry,'' he said. ''But I've got news for them: the Cuomo administration will not allow that plant to operate.'' Peter A. Bradford, chairman of the State Public Service Commission, said, ''There is in fact nothing the Department of Energy should do because their efforts can only raise electricity prices and increase the likelihood of power shortages on Long Island.'' Earlier this week, Mr. Moore sent a letter to the State Power Authority's chairman, Richard M. Flynn, urging him to ''reconsider and reject'' the Shoreham agreement. Under it, the agency is to be in charge of dismantling the plant; Mr. Moore wrote that he believed that this was beyond the scope of the agency's authority. In asserting that the agency did have the authority to dismantle the plant, Mr. Flynn said it was ''unfortunate'' that the Energy Department ''waited until this divisive issue finally had been settled before launching its long-range verbal missiles.'' Mr. Moore said that ''Shoreham has become a symbol of whether or not the United States will ever recognize the benefits of nuclear power, or just write it off and forget about it.''",1989-06-16T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region
0b2ca9df-6630-4517-a63c-f26abfba196b,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/world/asia/09japan.html,"Japan Official Ordered Nuclear E-Mails, Inquiry Finds","KYOTO, Japan — Investigators concluded Thursday that a nuclear plant operator that tried to manipulate public opinion with fake e-mails was acting under instructions from a high-ranking local government official, adding a new twist to a scandal that has hampered Japan’s efforts to restart idled nuclear reactors after the Fukushima disaster. An independent investigative committee found that the governor of Saga Prefecture told the operator, Kyushu Electric Power, to send e-mails supporting the restart of two reactors at the company’s Genkai Nuclear Power Station. The company has already admitted to ordering employees to pose as regular citizens by sending e-mails during an online town-hall-style meeting in June over whether to allow the restart of the reactors. Despite the company’s admission, the committee did not accuse the governor, Yasushi Furukawa, of explicitly asking officials to send e-mails masquerading as coming from the public, but only of asking it to send e-mails. Mr. Furukawa has denied requesting any faked e-mails, saying a Kyushu Electric vice president misunderstood his remarks during a private meeting earlier in June. Mr. Furukawa’s deliberations over whether to allow the restart have been the focus of national attention because his decision could sway other local leaders facing similar decisions about restarting reactors in their districts. If they denied every request to restart reactors, the local leaders could virtually shut down Japan’s nuclear power industry, which provides almost a third of the nation’s electrical generating capacity. Currently, 43 of Japan’s 54 reactors are sitting idle, only some because of damage from the huge earthquake and tsunami on March 11 that crippled the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Most have been shut for legally required maintenance checks that must take place every 13 months. Facing a public backlash against nuclear power, the national government is asking local governors and mayors to sign off before restarting those undamaged reactors. If none are restarted, the last operating reactor will have to be shut down by next April. Seeking to allay fears about the safety of the reactors, the previous prime minister, Naoto Kan, began a series of so-called stress tests to confirm the reactors’ ability to withstand large earthquakes. The tests, which have also been embraced by the new prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, are scheduled to be finished by the end of the year. However, by seeming to confirm widespread suspicions here that government is working secretly with industry to advance nuclear power despite growing public opposition, the scandal over faked e-mails could make it even more difficult for officials to grant permission to restart the reactors. Many Japanese blame such cozy ties for the national government’s failure to require tougher defenses against tsunamis at Fukushima Daiichi, which was crippled by the earthquake and tsunami. Earthquake risk is one reason the vast majority of Japanese now want to phase out nuclear power altogether, according to opinion polls. In an effort to appease public anger, Kyushu Electric created the investigative committee, which was headed by Nobuo Gohara, a well known former prosecutor. The committee said it made its findings after teams of lawyers interviewed 127 people, including top company executives. The scandal has already forced the resignation of a local lawmaker in Saga who headed a panel in the prefectural assembly that was also looking into whether to allow the restart of the reactors. The lawmaker, Hobun Kihara, admitted taking donations from Kyushu Electric.",2011-09-08T20:39:57.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Japan’s newly installed Nuclear Regulation Authority also said Wednesday that it would issue an order that would effectively keep a separate unit, the Monju experimental fast breeder reactor, closed until its operator overhauled safety measures at the site. Any move to decommission the Tsuruga commercial reactor would deal a blow to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s efforts to get the country’s nuclear program back online. So would yet another delay in restarting the troubled Monju experimental reactor, which is a major part of Japan’s longstanding goal of creating a system to recycle nuclear fuel. But those steps would show that the country’s new nuclear regulator, put in place to bolster oversight of the nuclear industry after the 2011 disaster, has teeth. Its predecessor was criticized as having a lax approach to safety and close industry ties. “It is really just a matter of luck that there hasn’t been an accident” at Tsuruga, said Kunihiko Shimazaki, the head of a panel of seismologists assessing the fault that runs beneath it, according to Reuters. Still, both the Tsuruga and Monju plants in Fukui Prefecture, even if not operative, could continue to face risks from a possible earthquake along the active fault. Almost 3,000 spent uranium fuel rods are stored at the Tsuruga plant, while the Monju site stores plutonium fuel. Some experts suspect that Monju also sits atop an active fault. All of Japan’s 50 commercial reactors were closed for inspections after the multiple meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi station, which forced the evacuation of more than 100,000 people. Since then, only two have been restarted. The fate of the country’s reactors depends on safety assessments being carried out by the new regulator agency, which has been studying the safety risks at those reactors. The agency faces considerable pressure from Japan’s power industry, businesses and pro-nuclear politicians in Mr. Abe’s governing party to allow more reactors to restart. Keeping them closed has led to significant financial losses for power companies, which have been forced to make up for the power shortfall with expensive fossil fuel imports. The blow of a permanent closing could make some power companies insolvent. Several power companies have said that they intend to restart their nuclear reactors this year, providing that they pass safety checks. The Japan Atomic Power Company, which operates the two-reactor Tsuruga station, has contended that the fault is not active. The company could not immediately be reached for comment. Dozens of governing party lawmakers formed a group on Tuesday to push for the resumption of idled nuclear reactors, saying that the economic recovery depended on a stable power supply. Large manufacturers in Japan have warned that rising energy costs will hurt business. In Wednesday’s announcement, seismologists directed by the regulatory authority to study a known fault that runs under the Tsuruga No. 2 reactor said that the fault showed signs of being geologically active, suggesting a high earthquake risk. The authority’s chairman, Shunichi Tanaka, said last year that he would not allow the reactor to go back online if the fault was found to be active. But the authority does not have legal power to order a permanent shutdown, a situation that could leave the reactor in limbo. It was not clear how the other reactor at the Tsuruga site, and two more under construction, would be affected by the authority’s decision on the No. 2 reactor. The authority is also assessing faults under five other reactors across Japan, and the results are expected in coming weeks. In a separate report released Wednesday, the Nuclear Regulation Authority said it was barring the operator of the Monju experimental reactor from beginning work to restart the unit until it overhauled its approach to safety. The authority said it believed that Monju’s operator, the government-backed Japan Atomic Energy Agency, “could not sufficiently secure the safety of Monju,” and added that it saw “a deterioration in its safety culture.” Kyodo News quoted an unidentified official at the agency as saying that additional inspections at the plant would take at least until next January. Monju’s operator revealed last year that it had not properly inspected more than 10,000 devices at the experimental reactor, including those deemed important to safety. The Monju reactor forms the cornerstone of a national project by Japan to reuse and eventually produce nuclear fuel. But the plant, a $12 billion project, has a history of safety lapses. It was closed for 14 years after a devastating fire in 1995, one of Japan’s most serious nuclear accidents before the one at Fukushima. Monju was reopened in May 2010, but just three months later, a 3.3-ton fuel relay device fell into the reactor’s pressure vessel, forcing it to close again. In the two decades since the reactor started tests in 1991, the atomic energy agency has managed to generate electricity at the reactor for only one full hour.",2013-05-15T14:09:13.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific
547b1cbf-6cc4-56fb-991c-5f19ce9fd1bd,https://www.tipsproject.eu/tips/,"In Finland, Nuclear Renaissance Runs Into Trouble","OLKILUOTO, Finland  As the Obama administration tries to steer America toward cleaner sources of energy, it would do well to consider the cautionary tale of this new-generation nuclear reactor site. The massive power plant under construction on muddy terrain on this Finnish island was supposed to be the showpiece of a nuclear renaissance. The most powerful reactor ever built, its modular design was supposed to make it faster and cheaper to build. And it was supposed to be safer, too. But things have not gone as planned. After four years of construction and thousands of defects and deficiencies, the reactor’s 3 billion euro price tag, about $4.2 billion, has climbed at least 50 percent. And while the reactor was originally meant to be completed this summer, Areva, the French company building it, and the utility that ordered it, are no longer willing to make certain predictions on when it will go online. While the American nuclear industry has predicted clear sailing after its first plants are built, the problems in Europe suggest these obstacles may be hard to avoid. A new fleet of reactors would be standardized down to “the carpeting and wallpaper,” as Michael J. Wallace, the chairman of UniStar Nuclear Energy  a joint venture between EDF Group and Constellation Energy, the Maryland-based utility  has said repeatedly. In the end, he says, that standardization will lead to significant savings. But early experience suggests these new reactors will be no easier or cheaper to build than the ones of a generation ago, when cost overruns  and then accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl  ended the last nuclear construction boom. In Flamanville, France, a clone of the Finnish reactor now under construction is also behind schedule and overbudget. In the United States, Florida and Georgia have changed state laws to raise electricity rates so that consumers will foot some of the bill for new nuclear plants in advance, before construction even begins. “A number of U.S. companies have looked with trepidation on the situation in Finland and at the magnitude of the investment there,” said Paul L. Joskow, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a co-author of an influential report on the future of nuclear power in 2003. “The rollout of new nuclear reactors will be a good deal slower than a lot of people were assuming.” For nuclear power to have a high impact on reducing greenhouse gases, an average of 12 reactors would have to be built worldwide each year until 2030, according to the Nuclear Energy Agency at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Right now, there are not even enough reactors under construction to replace those that are reaching the end of their lives. And of the 45 reactors being built around the world, 22 have encountered construction delays, according to an analysis prepared this year for the German government by Mycle Schneider, an energy analyst and a critic of the nuclear industry. He added that nine do not have official start-up dates. Most of the new construction is underway in countries like China and Russia, where strong central governments have made nuclear energy a national priority. India also has long seen nuclear as part of a national drive for self-sufficiency and now is seeking new nuclear technologies to reduce its reliance on imported uranium. By comparison, “the state has been all over the place in the United States and Europe on nuclear power,” Mr. Joskow said. The United States generates about one-fifth of its electricity from a fleet of 104 reactors, most built in the 1960s and 1970s. Coal still provides about half the country’s power. To streamline construction, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Washington has worked with the industry to approve a handful of designs. Even so, the schedule to certify the most advanced model from Westinghouse, a unit of Toshiba, has slipped during an ongoing review of its ability to withstand the impact of an airliner. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has also not yet approved the so-called EPR design under construction in Finland for the American market. This month, the United States Energy Department produced a short list of four reactor projects eligible for some loan guarantees. In the 2005 energy bill, Congress provided $18.5 billion, but the industry’s hope of winning an additional $50 billion worth of loan guarantees evaporated when that money was stripped from President Obama’s economic stimulus bill. The industry has had more success in getting states to help raise money. This year, authorities permitted Florida Power & Light to start charging millions of customers several dollars a month to finance four new reactors. Customers of Georgia Power, a subsidiary of the Southern Co., will pay on average $1.30 a month more in 2011, rising to $9.10 by 2017, to help pay for two reactors expected to go online in 2016 or later. But resistance is mounting. In April, Missouri legislators balked at a preconstruction rate increase, prompting the state’s largest electric utility, Ameren UE, to suspend plans for a $6 billion copy of Areva’s Finnish reactor. Areva, a conglomerate largely owned by the French state, is heir to that nation’s experience in building nuclear plants. France gets about 80 percent of its power from 58 reactors. But even France has not completed a new reactor since 1999. After designing an updated plant originally called the European Pressurized Reactor with German participation during the 1990s, the French had trouble selling it at home because of a saturated energy market as well as opposition from Green Party members in the then-coalition government. So Areva turned to Finland, where utilities and energy-hungry industries like pulp and paper had been lobbying for 15 years for more nuclear power. The project was initially budgeted at $4 billion and Teollisuuden Voima, the Finnish utility, pledged it would be ready in time to help the Finnish government meet its greenhouse gas targets under the Kyoto climate treaty, which runs through 2012. Areva promised electricity from the reactor could be generated more cheaply than from natural gas plants. Areva also said its model would deliver 1,600 megawatts, or about 10 percent of Finnish power needs. In 2001, the Finnish parliament narrowly approved construction of a reactor at Olkiluoto, an island on the Baltic Sea. Construction began four years later. Serious problems first arose over the vast concrete base slab for the foundation of the reactor building, which the country’s Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority found too porous and prone to corrosion. Since then, the authority has blamed Areva for allowing inexperienced subcontractors to drill holes in the wrong places on a vast steel container that seals the reactor. In December, the authority warned Anne Lauvergeon, the chief executive of Areva, that “the attitude or lack of professional knowledge of some persons” at Areva was holding up work on safety systems. Today, the site still teems with 4,000 workmen on round-the-clock shifts. Banners from dozens of subcontractors around Europe flutter in the breeze above temporary offices and makeshift canteens. Some 10,000 people speaking at least eight different languages have worked at the site. About 30 percent of the workforce is Polish, and communication has posed significant challenges. Areva has acknowledged that the cost of a new reactor today would be as much as 6 billion euros, or $8 billion, double the price offered to the Finns. But Areva said it was not cutting any corners in Finland. The two sides have agreed to arbitration, where they are both claiming more than 1 billion euros in compensation. (Areva blames the Finnish authorities for impeding construction and increasing costs for work it agreed to complete at a fixed price.) Areva announced a steep drop in earnings last year, which it blamed mostly on mounting losses from the project. In addition, nuclear safety inspectors in France have found cracks in the concrete base and steel reinforcements in the wrong places at the site in Flamanville. They also have warned Électricité de France, the utility building the reactor, that welders working on the steel container were not properly qualified. On top of such problems come the recession, weaker energy demand, tight credit and uncertainty over future policies, said Caren Byrd, an executive director of the global utility and power group at Morgan Stanley in New York. “The warning lights now are flashing more brightly than just a year ago about the cost of new nuclear,” she said. And Jouni Silvennoinen, the project manager at Olkiluoto, said, “We have had it easy here.” Olkiluoto is at least a geologically stable site. Earthquake risks in places like China and the United States or even the threat of storm surges mean building these reactors will be even trickier elsewhere.",2009-05-29T02:05:28.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business

Credit... David Guttenfelder for The New York Times KYIV, Ukraine — Tensions around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southern Ukraine escalated sharply on Thursday, as the Russian and Ukrainian militaries accused each other of preparing to stage an attack at the plant in coming days and risking a release of radiation. First, the Russian Ministry of Defense accused Ukrainian forces of preparing a “terrorist attack” involving the nuclear complex, which Russian forces occupy and Ukrainian engineers operate. The Ukrainian military intelligence agency, in turn, said the Russian “warning” was in fact a pretext for Moscow to take its own action. The agency said the complex’s Russian occupiers had declared a “day off” for Friday and would allow in only those workers essential to operating the plant. It also said that engineers from the Russian state nuclear company, Rosatom, had “urgently” left the plant. “On Aug. 19, only operative personnel will be at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant,” the Ukrainian agency said. “Entrance for all other employees will be closed.” An employee at the plant, communicating to The New York Times through a colleague in Kyiv, said that workers were terrified. “The situation is terrible, everyone is scared of tomorrow’s provocations announced by Russia,” said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of personal safety fears. “Russia’s Defense Ministry said they expect provocations from the Ukrainian side, but we understand perfectly well what that means. Even more people are trying to leave.” In recent weeks, daily shelling at the Zaporizhzhia complex has sparked international concerns about the possibility of a meltdown or release of radiation from spent nuclear fuel in storage. Each side has blamed the other for the shelling on the plant, which is Europe’s largest nuclear power complex, with six reactors on a site occupying about half a square mile. The uncertainty surrounding the security of the plant was underscored by a video that circulated online on Thursday, showing at least five apparent military trucks inside one of the complex’s buildings. By using archival photos of the interior of the different facilities on the premises of the nuclear complex, The Times determined that the videographer walked along a turbine inside the machine room of one of the complex’s six nuclear reactors. Earlier this month, Ukraine released aerial surveillance footage showing several military vehicles driving into one of these buildings.

The highlighted area is roughly the location of the military vehicles seen in the video circulating online on Thursday. Credit... Maxar Technologies, via Google Earth Why Russia would place military vehicles so close to a reactor is unclear. The reactors themselves are heavily fortified. The United Nations has offered to help send nuclear inspectors to the site if both sides agree. Ukraine says it supports that effort but has insisted that Russian forces withdraw from the plant first. The Russian Foreign Ministry on Thursday rejected international calls to have its forces pull back from the facility and create a demilitarized zone around the plant. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, warned the U.N. Security Council last Thursday that the situation had deteriorated “to the point of being very alarming.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, issued a more strongly worded alarm on Thursday. “The world is on a verge of nuclear disaster due to occupation of world’s third largest nuclear power plant,” he tweeted, adding, “How long will it take the global community to respond to Russia’s irresponsible actions and nuclear blackmailing?”",2022-08-18T22:07:22.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

The public broadcaster, NHK, said two people had died in Miyagi and Yamagata, including a 63-year-old woman whose ventilator stopped working in the blackout. Many more were injured. About 3.6 million households were still without power Friday morning. No tsunami was detected, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. The aftershock had a magnitude of 7.1, according to the United States Geological Survey ; last month’s quake, which devastated much of the northeastern coast, was measured at 9.0. But the agency warned of more aftershocks going forward. Many coastal communities were ravaged last month, and some have become even more vulnerable to tsunami waves because sea walls were breached and land levels sank. Early Friday, injuries were reported in Sendai City and across the region, and blackouts continued in some areas, according to NHK. Five coal-powered power plants also shut down, adding to concerns over energy shortages. Workers at the Fukushima Daiichi plant were told to take cover until the tsunami warning was lifted, but Japanese officials said at a news conference that water was still able to be pumped into three damaged reactors and a spent-fuel pool at a fourth in the crucial effort to keep their nuclear fuel cool. The plant’s cooling systems were knocked out by last month’s quake and tsunami. Nitrogen also continued to be piped into the No. 1 reactor, the company said, in an effort to prevent a possible explosion. The Tokyo Electric Power Company, which runs the power station, said early Friday that it had found no new damage to the plant, and workers had resumed work to identify the source of leaks, found last week, of radioactive water into pipes and tunnels under the complex. Monitoring posts at the plant were not showing any immediate increase in radiation levels, the company said. A big aftershock is thought to pose an additional risk to the Fukushima plant because its containment structures, now filled with water that is highly radioactive, may be more vulnerable to rupture, according to an assessment by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in late March. Two other nuclear facilities — a fuel reprocessing plant at Rokkasho and a power plant at Higashidori, both in northern Aomori Prefecture — were running on emergency diesel generators after their external power was knocked out. The single reactor at Higashidori is shut down for maintenance, and all nuclear fuel has been transferred to spent fuel pools, which are being cooled by back-up diesel power, according to the operator, Tohoku Electric. A third site, the Onagawa Nuclear Power Station in Miyagi Prefecture, lost two of its three external power systems, and cooling stopped temporarily at a spent fuel pool there, Tohoku Electric said. All three plants have been shut down since the March 11 quake, but power is needed to cool the nuclear fuel. The aftershock hit at 11:32 p.m. local time and was centered 41 miles east of Sendai, 72 miles from Fukushima and 205 miles from Tokyo, officials said. It was about 30 miles below the ocean floor, about 10 miles deeper than the March 11 quake. Hundreds of aftershocks have followed the initial quake, but Thursday’s was the strongest, according to the United States Geological Survey. The police say about 12,600 people have died as a result of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. More than 14,700 are listed as missing. Early Thursday, before the quake struck, nearly 240 police officers from Tokyo and about 100 from Fukushima Prefecture fanned out wearing protective suits in a search of bodies in the 12-mile evacuation zone around the Daiichi plant, according to Mikio Murakoshi, a police spokesman. Japanese and American soldiers conducted a huge search for the missing last weekend, but avoided the evacuation zone because of the radiation risk. But Mr. Murakoshi said radiation levels had dropped. Still, concerns about the plant remain high. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission speculated Wednesday that some of the core of the No. 2 reactor had flowed from its steel pressure vessel into the bottom of the containment structure. The theory implies more damage at the unit than previously believed. While a spokeswoman for Tokyo Electric dismissed the analysis, a spokesman for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency of Japan agreed that it was possible that the core had leaked into the larger containment vessel. The possibility raised new questions. The Nuclear Regulator Commission said that its speculation about the flow of core material out of the reactor vessel would explain high radiation readings in an area underneath, called the drywell. But some of the radiation readings at Reactors Nos. 1 and 3 over the last week were nearly as high as or higher than the 3,300 rems per hour that the commission said it was trying to explain, so it would appear that the speculation would apply to them as well. At No. 2, extremely radioactive material continues to ooze out of the reactor pressure vessel, and the leak is likely to widen with time, a western nuclear executive asserted. “It’s a little like pulling a thread out of your tie,” said the executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect business connections in Japan. “Any breach gets bigger.” Flashes of extremely intense radioactivity have become a serious problem, he said. Tokyo Electric’s difficulties in providing accurate information on radiation are not a result of software problems, as some Japanese officials have suggested, but stem from damage to measurement instruments caused by radiation, the executive said. Broken pieces of fuel rods have been found outside of Reactor No. 2, and are now being covered with bulldozers, he said. The pieces may be from rods in the spent-fuel pools that were flung out by hydrogen explosions.",2011-04-07T12:13:27.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Credit... Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times KYIV, Ukraine — A team of international nuclear experts made its way toward an imperiled nuclear plant in Ukraine on Wednesday morning from Kyiv, the capital, heading south toward the front lines where fighting has intensified in recent weeks. The group includes 14 experts with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog. They set off from Kyiv on Wednesday morning after a news conference outlining one of the most complicated missions in the agency’s history. The I.A.E.A. has also worked in Iraq, Iran and North Korea. A senior Ukrainian official warned that many challenges remained as the group made its way to the plant. One of the biggest obstacles will be finding safe passage through an active battlefield to the Russian-occupied facility. To reach the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the team must negotiate the craters and trenches of the front lines and enter an area where frequent shelling has raised fears of a nuclear catastrophe. The team could reach the front line between Russian and Ukrainian forces as early as Wednesday afternoon. “As you know, we have a very, very important task there to perform, to assess the real situation there, to help stabilize the situation as much as we can,” the I.A.E.A. director general, Rafael Grossi, told reporters in Kyiv early Wednesday before departing in a convoy of armored S.U.V. vehicles. Monitors intended to spend several days in the Russian-occupied nuclear facility, and will seek to establish a permanent monitoring mission at the plant, Mr. Grossi said. “After six months of steady efforts, the I.A.E.A. is moving in to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,” he said. Before the experts set out for the nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, they tried to broker some kind of deal with the two militaries. Fighting is intensifying in the south, where Ukraine is escalating strikes in what could be part of broader counteroffensive. By early Wednesday, Mr. Grossi said the mission had secured safety guarantees from both the Russian and Ukrainian militaries, though dangers lingered. “We are going to a war zone, we are going to occupied territory,” he said. Both Russia, whose forces seized the plant not long after invading, and Ukraine, whose military holds positions only a few miles away, say they support the I.A.E.A. mission. But they have disagreed on how it should be carried out. Russian officials have ignored pleas to withdraw from the facility to create a demilitarized zone around it. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine’s president, said in an interview on Tuesday that key aspects of the negotiations were in question, among them the route to the facility. He said he was still hopeful, however, that the monitors would reach the plant “one way or another.”",2022-08-31T06:19:59.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Areva, a French-owned nuclear company with links to the reactor technology developed by Westinghouse and Babcock & Wilcox, and Constellation Energy, a Baltimore company that operates five reactors in Maryland and New York, said they would work together to manufacture, construct and then operate a reactor, and would retain partial ownership, selling the rest to a utility company or other investor. The two companies enlisted Bechtel, an architect-engineering firm with extensive nuclear experience, to join the project, called UniStar Nuclear. Almost all the nuclear reactors in operation in this country were built when a utility ordered the parts from a manufacturer, hired a company to build the plant and then learned on its own to run it, a system that contributed to huge cost overruns and operating problems. In July, Congress approved sweeping energy legislation that offers substantial subsidies for building new reactors. Even before that, many companies expressed interest in building reactors because the primary competing fuel, natural gas, had become so expensive and because of uncertainty about future regulations regarding coal plants. The new model is intended to cut the risk to investors, who were badly hurt in the 1980's when delays and technical problems pushed the price of some reactors to 8 or 10 times the original estimates. The goal is to build groups of identical reactors, taking advantage of economies of scale. In another step to limit risk, Areva said it would use a new procedure developed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to have a reactor design approved before construction. The company would use a 1,600-megawatt design that is under construction in Olkiluoto, Finland. That plant is being built in partnership with Siemens, the German nuclear company. When America's existing reactors were ordered, the practice was to seek a license while construction was under way. Regulators would then order design changes after the welders and concrete pourers had done their work, and no two plants ended up alike. ''UniStar Nuclear will pioneer a path that will help bring a new generation of nuclear power plants a major step closer to reality,'' said Michael J. Wallace, executive vice president of Constellation. ''At the heart of UniStar Nuclear is a one-stop shopping approach to developing and deploying nuclear power plants. UniStar will provide an unprecedented level of certainty for energy companies and others contemplating new plants.'' Areva is an owner of two French nuclear power companies, and in recent years its has bought Exxon Nuclear, the Yankee Atomic Engineering Company and the nuclear division of Babcock & Wilcox. Areva has 8,000 employees in the United States and is the largest provider of services to nuclear plants in this country. Constellation named two possible sites for a new reactor: Calvert Cliffs, Md., where it has two reactors, and Nine Mile Point, near Oswego, N.Y., where it has two more. Ground could be broken by 2010, with operation in 2015, the partnership said. The reactor is described as ''evolutionary,'' meaning that it would be built on the same general lines as current reactors, but with improvements to make it simpler and more reliable. For example, while most reactors have two sets of emergency pipes and pumps, the Areva design has four, to ensure that the reactor can keep running while one set is out of service for maintenance or repair. It has 47 percent fewer valves and 16 percent fewer pumps. The youngest nuclear plant in the United States entered service in 1995. The last plant ordered, not counting those canceled before completion, was in 1973. Rising construction costs, the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and the 1986 explosion at Chernobyl in the Ukraine, as well as cheap natural gas, combined to make the utilities look to other sources. But the day of cheap fuel is gone, and the accidents are decades in the past.

This effect results primarily from emission of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heating and vehicle propulsion, creating a blanket that allows the sun's heat to reach the earth, but reflects heat back to earth, rather than allowing it to escape. If the energy needed for lighting, cooling, heating, air-conditioning, driving motors, operating computers and propelling vehicles was provided by electricity from nuclear energy, the greenhouse effect wouldn't exist, or could be rolled back. Some energy can be provided from solar and wind power, and much more from hydro power, and conservation can moderate energy demand. But the bottom line is nuclear energy, the only source with enough potential. How ironic that the most vociferous critics of the Administration for alleged inaction on global warming are the same people who have opposed nuclear energy and criticize the Administration for supporting it. But the more savvy critics see the handwriting on the wall and are beginning to segue into the pro-nuclear camp, trailing platitudes and provisos, e.g., that plants will have to be made even safer, a high-level waste disposal site must be activated. When the mincing becomes a stampede to nuclear, we'll be able to chase away global warming and the environmental pollution from the burning of fossil fuels. R. M.

Kouts, a pioneer in nuclear power safety research and an expert in weapons proliferation, died on Jan. 7 at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital in East Patchogue, N.Y. He was 88. The cause was congestive heart failure and complications from a fall, said his daughter Catherine J. Sigmon. Dr. Kouts was the director of reactor safety research at the Atomic Energy Commission in the early 1970s, as most of the reactors in service today were being built, and held the equivalent post when the successor organization, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, was formed. When Congress established the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board in 1988 to oversee the weapons work of the Energy Department, he was appointed as one of its initial members and served there until 2000. He worked afterward as a consultant to the board. “He was essentially in physics for his entire life,” said A. J. Eggenberger, the chairman of that board. Born in Bisbee, Ariz., in 1919, Dr. Kouts served in England during World War II, organizing a school to teach maintenance of airborne radar. He left the armed forces as a major in 1945. He turned to nuclear physics soon after, established the Reactor Shielding Group at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, in Upton, N.Y. He was later the head of the reactor physics division there. In 1983, Dr. Kouts served on a commission established by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York to advise about what to do with the Shoreham nuclear reactor, which was nearing completion but faced strong local opposition on safety grounds. In an appendix to the commission’s report, Dr. Kouts said: “All careful analysis confirms that the risk of nuclear power is small. The chance of a large accident is very low, and consequences of such an accident would be substantially less than most people think.” “In the United States, the near-term risk of doing without nuclear power is the risk attached to using oil or coal instead,” he wrote. “The problems that these cause include acid rain; enormous balance-of-payment problems in the case of oil; the risk of war to ensure oil supplies; carcinogens in the air as oil and coal are burned; heavy metals such as mercury, lead and uranium emitted to the atmosphere as coal burns; black lung disease as coal is mined; vast areas of the country ruined as coal is strip-mined, etc.” In 1984, lamenting the decline of the civilian nuclear industry, Dr. Kouts said the problem was that the duty to regulate had been given to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, without giving it any responsibility for the viability of the industry. The Atomic Energy Commission had had both jobs, but Congress decided that was a conflict of interest for the agency. Dr. Kouts’s career spanned a period of enormous change in nuclear regulation and public attitudes. In 1999, when plutonium in a Japanese fuel plant was accidentally allowed to form a critical mass and sustain a nuclear reaction outside a reactor, Dr. Kouts observed that there had been a time when the public would accept mishaps in that industry, but that such an accident “is now a complete no-no.” In 1981, when the Israeli air force destroyed a small nuclear reactor being built by Iraq, Dr. Kouts was one of those called on by Congress as it sought to determine the nuclear intentions of the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. In addition to his daughter Ms. Sigmon, of Tempe, Ariz., Mr. Kouts is survived by his wife, Barbara, of Bellport, N.Y.; another daughter, Anne Golden of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.; three stepsons, Francis Spitzer of Brookhaven, N.Y., Michael Spitzer of Sheffield, Mass., and Daniel Spitzer of Bellport; a sister, Shirley Smith of Worcester, Mass., a half-sister, Elaine Zirkle of Monroe, La.; and nine grandchildren.",2008-01-14T07:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,national-u.s.

Their account will win them few friends among the military and the Federal bureaucracy (particularly the Nuclear Regulatory Commission), or among those members of the scientific community who work with the Government. The authors go back to the 19th century to establish the beginnings of particle physics; they trace the activities of the Manhattan Project up to the successful testing of an atomic bomb; then they focus on the nuclear weapons race and the drive for atomic energy. Among the interesting stories they have to tell is this one: early in 1947 the Atomic Energy Commission, which had just taken over the Manhattan Project from the military, had to inform President Harry S.

Second, why not instead sink resources into learning how economically to tap an enormously greater source of nuclear energy, our sun?

Credit... David Guttenfelder for The New York Times KYIV, Ukraine — Tensions around the nuclear power plant on the front lines of the war in Ukraine escalated sharply on Thursday, as the Russian and Ukrainian militaries traded charges that each was preparing to stage an attack on the plant in coming days, risking a catastrophic release of radiation. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that the Ukrainian military was preparing a “terrorist attack” on the sprawling Zaporizhzhia power plant complex on the Dnipro river, prompting the Ukrainian military intelligence agency to respond that the Russian warning was in fact a pretext for Moscow to stage a “provocation” of some kind there on Friday. Invading Russian forces seized control of the plant, Europe’s largest nuclear power station, in early March and put it under the control of Rosatom, the Russian state nuclear company. But they have kept Ukrainian staff there — many of them by force, Ukraine claims — to operate it. On Thursday, the Ukrainian intelligence agency said that Rosatom engineers had “urgently” left the plant and that only “operative personnel” would be allowed at the plant on Friday. “Entrance for all other employees will be closed,” it said. An employee at the plant, communicating to The New York Times through a colleague in Kyiv, said that workers were terrified. “The situation is terrible, everyone is scared of tomorrow’s provocations announced by Russia,” said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear for her safety. “Russia’s Defense Ministry said they expect provocations from the Ukrainian side, but we understand perfectly well what that means. Even more people are trying to leave.” The fears of a possible attack came even as the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, held talks in the city of Lviv, in western Ukraine, with the Ukrainian and Turkish presidents in an effort to ease military tensions around the site and restart diplomatic engagement to end the nearly six-month-old war. U.N. nuclear regulators have been pleading for access to the plant to ensure its safety. In recent weeks, daily shelling at the Zaporizhzhia complex has sparked international concerns about the possibility of a meltdown or release of radiation from spent nuclear fuel in storage. Each side has blamed the other for the shelling on the plant, which is Europe’s largest nuclear power complex, with six reactors on a site occupying about half a square mile. The uncertainty surrounding the security of the plant was underscored by a video that circulated online on Thursday, showing at least five apparent military trucks inside one of the complex’s buildings. By using archival photos of the interior of the different facilities on the premises of the nuclear complex, The Times determined that the videographer walked along a turbine inside the machine room of one of the complex’s six nuclear reactors. Earlier this month, Ukraine released aerial surveillance footage showing several military vehicles driving into one of these buildings.

The highlighted area is roughly the location of the military vehicles seen in the video circulating online on Thursday. Credit... Maxar Technologies, via Google Earth Why Russia would place military vehicles so close to a reactor is unclear. The reactors themselves are heavily fortified. The United Nations has offered to help send nuclear inspectors to the site if both sides agree. Ukraine says it supports that effort but has insisted that Russian forces withdraw from the plant first. The Russian Foreign Ministry on Thursday rejected international calls to have its forces pull back from the facility and create a demilitarized zone around the plant. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, warned the U.N. Security Council last Thursday that the situation had deteriorated “to the point of being very alarming.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, issued a more strongly worded alarm on Thursday. “The world is on a verge of nuclear disaster due to occupation of world’s third largest nuclear power plant,” he tweeted, adding, “How long will it take the global community to respond to Russia’s irresponsible actions and nuclear blackmailing?”",2022-08-18T22:39:40.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

WITH global warming, research on safer reactors and the need for more energy all converging, advocates of nuclear power see signs that the industry is overcoming years of public criticism and doubt. On May 2, the Tennessee Valley Authority was granted permission by the Government to restart one of three reactors at the Browns Ferry plant in northern Alabama after the longest shutdown for safety reasons in the history of the industry. With the startup scheduled for sometime before the end of the month, Browns Ferry will be the last of five nuclear plants in the United States to open after extended closures. An even more significant event occurred on April 10, when the National Academy of Sciences urged the Government to quickly develop and test a new generation of reactors. Unlike coal-fired electric plants, the academy noted, nuclear reactors produce none of the carbon compounds that cause global warming. Designs under consideration in the United States, Japan and Europe would have far less likelihood of melting down in an accident than would conventional reactors, according to engineers. Recently, three environmental groups that have opposed nuclear energy -- the National Audubon Society, the World Resources Institute and the Union of Concerned Scientists -- have guardedly recognized the technology's potential and accepted the need for more research. ""Because of the global warming problem these new generation reactors have to be looked into for insurance purposes,"" said Dr. Jan Beyea, a nuclear physicist with the National Audubon Society in New York. In the public mind, the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979, followed seven years later by the catastrophe at Chernobyl, seemed to seal the technology's fate as a long-term source of electricity. In 1989 alone, the Long Island Lighting Company pulled the fuel rods from the brand new Shoreham plant, voters in California shut Rancho Seco, a nuclear plant south of Sacramento, and the owners of the Fort St. Vrain nuclear plant in Colorado closed it after years of dismal operation. Though it is far from clear whether the engineering and political trends of the last few months will persuade utilities to start buying reactors again, the industry is optimistic about making a comeback. The Department of Energy is spending $160 million this year on research to design a new generation of safer, advanced reactors. The country's major manufacturers -- Westinghouse, General Electric, Combustion Engineering and Babcock and Wilcox -- have entered into joint ventures among themselves and with foreign reactor builders to search for new designs. Legislation sponsored by the Bush Administration to make licensing faster is receiving support in Congress. Weighing Alternatives In its National Energy Strategy, made public earlier this year, the Department of Energy estimated that demand for electricity in the year 2010 will rise to 950 billion watts from 700 billion today. Energy conservation could slow the increase but will not eliminate it, the Energy Department said. Other options also present problems. Most of the good hydroelectric sites have already been taken and environmentalists are battling to save the last wild stretches of river from the dam builders. Solar power shows increasing promise, but the Government has been reluctant to provide much financing for research, and the largescale manufacture of photovoltaic panels would produce toxic chemical pollution. Burning and mining coal are an environmental menace. The future of nuclear power will not be decided, though, until utility boards of directors are convinced the technology will be accepted by the public. ""Neither Wall Street nor Main Street seems very supportive of a renewal of nuclear power,"" said Dan W. Reicher, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council. That is true in financial circles. But there are signs that the public is less fearful than it used to be. When a fire and explosion destroyed the electrical transformer of the Maine Yankee plant late last month, citizens of Wiscasset, where the reactor has operated for 19 years, reacted with a giant yawn. The announcement that T.V.A. was close to starting Browns Ferry was greeted with enthusiasm in Alabama. Still, enduring national acceptance will not come until the nuclear industry solves two problems it has battled since the beginning of the 1950's -- making reactors more reliable and disposing of radioactive wastes. Billions of dollars spent on new equipment and training since Three Mile Island has resulted in fewer unplanned shutdowns and fewer accidents, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The country's reactors operated at 68 percent of their capacity last year, a higher rate than in any other year, but still not as good as that of some other sources of power. The industry is still years away from solving the nuclear waste problem. After spending hundreds of millions of dollars studying a site in Nevada for disposing the most dangerous radioactive wastes, the Department of Energy said last year that its program was a technical failure and that the Government was going to start over. The industry's problems, though, are not deterring the Tennessee Valley Authority, a Federal agency based in Knoxville, Tenn. Once rebuked by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and reviled by independent authorities for its inability to operate nuclear reactors safely, the T.V.A. was commended last year by the Government for its operation of the Sequoyah Nuclear power plant in Soddy Daisy, Tenn. Sequoyah, closed from 1985 to 1988 for repairs, was ranked second in the United States and eighth in the world in 1989 for its reliability and the amount of electricity it generated. Marvin Runyon, the chairman of the T.V.A., believes nuclear power is just as economical as generating electricity from coal and ultimately safer for the environment. In an interview last week, Mr. Runyon said he plans to restart two more reactors at Browns Ferry, and complete four other reactors at two unfinished nuclear plants in Alabama and Tennessee before the end of the decade. He is even considering buying a new reactor, the first ordered in the United States since 1973.",1991-05-12T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,week-in-review

Explosions in and around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power complex at about 2:30 p.m. destroyed electrical transmission lines and posed risks of damaging the plant, forcing engineers to alter the operation of one of its six reactors by reducing power, Ukraine’s state nuclear company, Energoatom, said. Hours later, a second series of three explosions damaged an auxiliary building near one of the nuclear reactors, raising the risk of hydrogen leaks and fire, the company said. President Volodymyr Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials blamed Russia for the attacks. “This is the largest nuclear power plant on our continent, and any shelling of this facility is an open, brazen crime, an act of terror,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address. “Russia should bear responsibility for the very fact of creating a threat to the nuclear power plant.” The Russian ministry of defense said it was Ukrainian forces who had shelled the plant, accusing them of an act of “nuclear terrorism.” No radiation was released after the first explosions, the state nuclear company said. But the forced change in the reactor’s operation underscored the rising danger. Fighting has intensified in recent weeks near the nuclear complex, which the Russian military controls and is using as a fortress, even as Ukrainian engineers continue to operate it. For about a month, Russia has used the site to stage artillery strikes on Ukrainian targets without fear of retaliation, since the Ukrainian military cannot fire back without risk of hitting safety equipment, reactors or storage facilities for spent fuel. Ukrainian officials say the Russians aim to disrupt a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the country’s south. After the explosions on Friday afternoon severed a high-voltage electrical line, the plant operators reduced output from one of the reactors. Previously, three of the six reactors at the plant were operational, two were on standby and one was undergoing planned repairs. It was not clear if the reactor whose operation was altered on Friday was shifted to a standby status, said Dmytro Orlov, a former plant engineer who is now the mayor of Enerhodar, where the plant is. “This is an unusual event but not unpredictable,” he said. “Personnel were prepared.” He compared it to the emergency response in the case that an electrical line were damaged by wildfire or another accident. Energoatom, the state power company, released a statement on the Telegram social networking site saying that Russian artillery fire had severed the electrical line. “The Russian military again resorted to provocation,” the company said. It said an industrial space on the complex’s grounds was struck three times, hitting the wiring and a transformer. The statement said the operators reduced output and disconnected one reactor from the electrical grid. “Releases of radioactive substances were not recorded,” the statement said. Hours later, the energy company reported a second attack on Telegram, saying Russians had fired three rocket-propelled grenades that landed near one of the nuclear reactors. The explosions, the statement said, damaged an auxiliary building and a specialized station. “Fire danger is high,” the company said. The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was aware of the reports and seeking further information about the situation. Ukrainian officials say they have few options but to endure the Russian bombardments. In July, Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said it had used a precision-guided “kamikaze” drone, which explodes on contact with a target, to destroy a Russian rocket launcher and air defense system located about 150 yards from a reactor, without damaging the reactor itself. The I.A.E.A. has warned of grave dangers from the plight of the plant. Cornerstones of nuclear safety, it said, are being knocked out from the plant even as it continues operating. Among the shortcomings, it said, are a lack of physical security and regulatory oversight, which is in limbo now. Those concerns were echoed by Britain’s defense ministry on Friday. In its daily intelligence update, the ministry said that Russian troops “have likely undermined the security” of the plant by using it as a base to “target Ukrainian territory on the western bank of the Dnipro river.” Fighting around the complex in March had caused a fire that stoked global concerns about a possible nuclear accident.",2022-08-06T09:33:55.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

Among the shortcomings, it said, are a lack of physical security and regulatory oversight, which is in limbo now. Those concerns were echoed by Britain’s defense ministry on Friday. In its daily intelligence update, the ministry said that Russian troops “have likely undermined the security” of the plant by using it as a base to “target Ukrainian territory on the western bank of the Dnipro river.” Fighting around the complex in March had caused a fire that stoked global concerns about a possible nuclear accident.",2022-08-06T00:38:22.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

Credit... David Guttenfelder for The New York Times ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine — Artillery fire resumed on Sunday from the direction of a nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, with shells streaking into a town from which the Ukrainian army has been unable to return fire, for fear of causing a meltdown or releasing radiation at the plant. Hours before the barrages, there were reports that conditions were unraveling in and near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. The flight of civilians from the area accelerated on Saturday. The plant is the first active nuclear power plant in a combat zone. The United States and European Union have called for the formation of a demilitarized zone, as the fighting in and around the plant and its active reactors and stored nuclear waste has sparked particular worry. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in his nightly address on Saturday that Russia had resorted to “nuclear blackmail” at the plant, reiterating a Ukrainian analysis that Moscow was using it to slow a Ukrainian counteroffensive toward the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, where Russian conventional military defenses appear increasingly wobbly. Contrary to the fears of some analysts when Moscow launched its invasion in February, the more urgent nuclear threat in the Ukraine war now appears to be Russia damaging the civilian plant, rather than deploying its own nuclear weapons. Russia says it’s Ukrainian forces who are shelling the plant. Engineers say that yard-thick reinforced concrete containment structures protect the reactors from even direct hits. International concern, however, has grown that shelling could spark a fire or cause other damage that would lead to a nuclear accident. The six pressurized water reactors at the complex retain most sources of radiation, reducing risks. After pressurized water reactors failed at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan in 2011, Ukraine upgraded the Zaporizhzhia site to enable a shutdown even after the loss of cooling water from outside the containment structures, Dmytro Gortenko, a former plant engineer, said in an interview. Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said that on Saturday, Russian artillery fire hit a pump, damaged a fire station and sparked fires near the plant that could not be immediately extinguished because of the damage to the fire station. In fields near the Russian-controlled town of Enerhodar, close to the plant, long lines of cars carrying fleeing civilians formed on Saturday, according to social media posts and another former engineer at the plant who has remained in touch with local residents. “Locals are abandoning the town,” said the former engineer, who asked to be identified by only his first name, Oleksiy, because of security concerns. Residents had been leaving for weeks, but the pace picked up after Saturday’s barrages and fires, he said. Since Russia captured the plant in March, its army has controlled the facility, while Ukrainian engineers have continued to operate it. Ukrainian employees are not fleeing but sending their families away, said Oleksiy, who left in June. Enerhodar was built for plant employees in the Soviet period and had a prewar population of about 50,000. Ukraine has accused Russia of staging artillery attacks targeting Ukrainian towns across the Dnipro River from the plant starting in July, as Ukraine’s counteroffensive in the south ramped up. Overnight into Sunday morning, Russian howitzers fired on the Ukrainian town of Nikopol, which lies across a reservoir from the power plant, Yevheny Yetushenko, the Ukrainian military governor of the town, said in a post on Telegram. The Ukrainian military has said it has few options for firing back. In July, it used a self-destructing drone to strike a Russian rocket artillery launcher that sat about 150 yards from one of the plant’s reactors.",2022-08-14T10:36:16.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Explaining our recent political climate regarding Shoreham with references to mythology is clever but useless. He speaks of a recent report on global warning and ties it to burning fossil fuels and using nuclear power. He should know that nuclear plants do not pollute. Then we get a dose of ''the decision-making power on energy choices is held by people invested in the old ways of producing energy.'' His criticism of LIPA and Richard Kessel is misdirected. Mr. Kessel, Mario Cuomo, Governor Pataki, local politicians and the leaders at Lilco were instrumental in the closing of Shoreham. Because of their active complicity, we ratepayers and taxpayers have a $7 billion debt. We bought the Shoreham plant, which we can't use and paid too much for. As with many other political scams, our grandchildren will be stuck with the debt. Mr. Maniscalco is under the impression that we are ready to use renewable technology but that the bad guys are keeping them from us. He also looks forward to the ''unveiling of and implementation of a visionary energy plan for Long Island'' that could include solar, wind and fuel cells. Yes, we could build all these. If we want to pay a lot more for our energy and are willing to build huge towers with whirling fans for many miles along our shore and cover many, many square miles with solar panels. None of the renewable sources he names are practical, cost-effective replacements for our energy needs. And what will we call these facilities? Maybe Energy Parks. Nuclear energy is practical. Both France and Japan generate a major portion of their electricity using nuclear power. We have more than 200 nuclear plants in our country. They work and don't pollute. Being afraid that there could be a nuclear accident while we are told that the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans are shortened every year because of the pollution spewed out of our plants makes no sense.

a4ad95ec-d327-5100-a44a-b97cf3576adc,https://www.tipsproject.eu/tips/,Big Alaska Looks to Small Nuclear,"In a quest to lower energy prices, some municipalities in the oil-rich state of Alaska are looking to small-scale nuclear power. Galena , a village of 580 people on the Yukon River, has been working for years with energy giant Toshiba to bring a small nuclear power plant to their village. Now a Fairbanks developer, John Reeves , is proposing a somewhat larger plant, designed by Hyperion Power Generation of Santa Fe, N.M., for the Fairbanks area. “In my opinion, it’s the best energy there is,” Mr. Reeves said last week. “No carbon dioxide.” Both projects involve small reactors that would be buried underground and operate for many years without the need for refueling. Toshiba’s reactor , dubbed the 4S for “Super-Safe, Small and Simple,” is designed to produce 10 megawatts of electricity for 30 years without refueling. It would be cooled by liquid metal. (Toshiba is also developing a 50MW version.) Hyperion is promising a reactor that can produce 25MW for five to 10 years and uses uranium hydride as a combination fuel and temperature-moderator. Alaska’s governor supports the concept. “Absolutely I can see nuclear playing a role in our energy agenda,” Gov. Sarah Palin wrote in an e-mail message last week. “Small-scale nuclear is an exciting prospect and fits with development of our more conventional sources of non-renewables. “Nuclear obviously plays an important energy role in our country,” Ms. Palin added. “I support it, and now it will be interesting to hear what locally affected Alaskans say about the prospects in our state.” Both plants represent a new approach to nuclear power — small reactors that can be mass-produced, require little maintenance, and are theoretically easier to permit and build than large-scale plants ( Babcock & Wilcox and NuScale Power are also pursuing the idea, among other companies.) Neither Hyperion nor Toshiba has applied for design certification from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , however, and an N.R.C. spokesman, Scott Burnell, said both ideas are unusual enough that the certification process will be on the long side. Hyperion especially has lots of work to do before even applying for certification, Mr. Burnell said. “They are essentially at square one.” Once a design is certified as safe, a project developer will still need to secure a license to build and operate the plant at a given site, which can also take years. And there is already opposition along the Yukon — from the Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council — and in Ester, where Mr. Reeves is working. “The basic idea seems pretty cool,” said Deirdre Helfferich, the publisher of the Ester Republic newspaper. “But there’s still the ethical issue of leaving behind nasty waste for hundreds of thousands of years.”",2009-06-30T15:18:31.000+02:00,NYTIMES,science

Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in Kyiv, Ukraine, last week. Credit... Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times Shelling at a nuclear plant in Ukraine has international monitors “gravely concerned” and a security protection zone should be established immediately, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog agency said in a report on Tuesday after a visit to the embattled Zaporizhzhia facility. But the experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency said the fighting has not triggered a nuclear emergency at the plant in southern Ukraine that has become one of the critical flash points in the war since Russia invaded in February.. Monitors from the I.A.E.A. visited the facility last week amid continuing shelling. In a report on its findings, the agency said that shelling should be “stopped immediately” and that it was prepared to start consultations with both sides in the conflict over security at the plant, which is the largest in Europe. For weeks, fighting around the large facility — which was seized by Russian forces in March but is operated by Ukrainian engineers — has raised fears of a nuclear accident. Dry nuclear fuel storage tanks were damaged last month and, in recent days, there has been a fire and loss of power to the plant. On Monday, renewed shelling caused a fire that once again led to the plant’s disconnection from Ukraine’s national power grid. “While the ongoing shelling has not yet triggered a nuclear emergency, it continues to represent a constant threat to nuclear safety and security with potential impact on critical safety functions that may lead to radiological consequences with great safety significance,” the report said. The power plant, which lies on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, is strategically significant as a critical piece of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. In addition, the region borders an area where Ukrainian forces have mounted a counteroffensive that aims to reclaim territory lost to Russia at the start of the war. Both countries have blamed the other for the shelling around the plant, which injured one worker last month, according to the report. The report — which was released ahead of a briefing by the agency’s director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, to the U.N. Security Council later on Tuesday — noted that the plant’s workers are operating in a challenging environment. “The condition that the operating staff is subject to constant high stress and pressure while operating the N.P.P. is not sustainable and could lead to increased human error with implications on nuclear safety,” the report said. After the I.A.E.A.’s visit to the plant last week following intensive negotiations with both sides to guarantee security, some inspectors remained at the site, in part to witness events but also in the hope that their presence might help to improve security. On Monday, a fire caused by shelling forced staff members to sever the plant’s last connection to a reserve line that was providing its only source of outside power. That placed critical cooling systems at risk of relying solely on emergency backup power, said Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Galushchenko. Reactor No. 6, the only working reactor at the plant, was still producing power for the facility itself. As of Monday evening, engineers had not switched on diesel generators, according to an official from Energoatom, the Ukrainian company responsible for operating the facility. Mr. Galushchenko said it was yet another precarious moment made more threatening by the fact that firefighting crews had not been able to reach the site of the blaze. “Any repairs to the lines are now impossible,” he said. “Fighting is taking place around the station.”",2022-09-06T17:28:48.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission today removed a major obstacle to the opening of nuclear power plants at Shoreham, L.I., and Seabrook, N.H. In a rule change adopted by a 5-to-0 vote, the commission made it impossible for state and local governments to prevent a plant from operating by refusing to participate in the planning for an evacuation of nearby residents in an emergency. While today's decision was seen as a defeat for opponents of nuclear power, it by no means guarantees that either of the two plants will begin commercial operation soon. Years of court challenges may lie ahead. Ruling Is Explained The change involves a 1980 rule calling for utilities and local government officials to cooperate in drawing up and testing emergency evacuation plans for all commercial reactors. Today the commission said that while the cooperation of local officials was desirable, the rule should not grant them a veto over the opening of a plant through the withholding such cooperation. In explaining the rule change, which will become permanent after a 30-day period for public comment, Lando W. Zech Jr., the nuclear agency's chairman, said that commission members were convinced that ''in the case of an actual emergency, state and local governments will indeed act responsibly and take actions to protect the public.'' He stressed that the rule change ''does not guarantee a license to any applicant.'' However, Representative George J. Hochbrueckner, a Democrat from Suffolk County, where the Shoreham plant is situated, said the decision, ''is clearly the path to jam those plants down the throats of the people of Long Island and New England.'' Massachusetts Opposes Seabrook The opening of Shoreham, owned by the Long Island Lighting Company and valued at close to $5 billion, is opposed by both New York State and Suffolk County. Seabrook, owned by a consortium of utilities, has a price tag almost as high. It is not opposed by New Hampshire but faces the opposition of officials across the Massachusetts border. Opponents of the two plants have argued that for geographical and other reasons it would be impossible to safely evacuate the 10-mile zones surrounding them and that no emergency plan could be adequate. Proponents of nuclear power have warned that allowing state and local governments to block power plants could lead to shutting them down across the country. Significance Is Disputed Mr. Hochbrueckner predicted that today's decision would be challenged in court and in Congress. An attempt a few months ago to pass legislation barring the nuclear agency from changing its rules on evacuation failed. Today's ruling says that while state and local participation in emergency planning ''is highly desirable and indeed is essential for maximum effectiveness of emergency planning and preparedness, Congress did not intend that the absence of such participation should preclude licensing of substantially completed nulear power plants where there is a utility-prepared emergency plan that provides reasonable assurance of adequate protection to the public.'' James K. Asselstine, a former N.R.C. commissioner who often cast dissenting votes and has been viewed as a critic of the nuclear power industry, noted that the N.R.C. had not gone so far as to say that it would automatically accept an emergency plan created by a utility in the absence of local or state cooperation. 'Off the Deep End' ''That means that there is still likely to be extended hearings,'' he said Herbert Brown, a Washington lawyer for Suffolk County, disagreed with that evaluation and sharply denounced the N.R.C. ''They went off the deep end trying to do a favor for Lilco,'' he said. Mr. Brown asserted that the major effect of the rule change would be to ''make it more likely that the litigation will take longer, be more intense and complicated than it would have been.'' Anthony Earley, Lilco's general counsel, said the utility was ''pleased with the opportunity to show that our plan protects the public safety.'' Lilco is still awaiting an N.R.C. ruling on the adequacy of an emergency plan it designed and rehearsed nearly two years ago.",1987-10-30T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

Nuclear safety activists have long warned that the aging plant, built along the coast in an area laced with known fault lines, should be closed. The plant is 120 miles southwest of Tokyo, about 40 miles closer than the Fukushima Daiichi plant, which has been spewing radioactive material since a magnitude-9.0 quake and a tsunami devastated the country’s northeast coast on March 11. Safety activists say the problems at the plant include inadequate protections against tsunamis; its operator has said it relies on sand dunes to block waves. Mr. Kan’s decision to suspend operations at the Hamaoka plant was made relatively quickly by the standards in Japan, where leaders generally prefer to build a consensus before announcing such policy changes. But Mr. Kan has faced withering criticism for his handling of the Fukushima disaster, including accusations that a slow government response in the early hours of the crisis made it worse. In explaining his decision on Friday, he said it was “the result of considering the tremendous repercussions a major accident at Hamaoka would have on the entire Japanese society.” The government’s own experts have estimated that there is a close to a 90 percent chance of an earthquake of about magnitude 8.0 hitting the area within the next 30 years. Much less severe earthquakes have damaged at least one nuclear plant in Japan in recent years. In 2009, Hamaoka’s operator, the Chubu Electric Power Company, decommissioned the site’s two oldest reactors after deciding that upgrading them to withstand earthquake risks would be too costly. Those reactors were built in the 1970s, around the same time as those at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The power company argued that the remaining three reactors, built in the 1980s, were safe enough to withstand a major earthquake. But the crisis at the Fukushima plant has heightened concerns over the risks posed by quakes and tsunamis to the nearly 50 nuclear reactors in operation in Japan. Mr. Kan said that Chubu Electric would be asked to strengthen its defenses before a restart could be authorized. The company said that constructing an adequate sea wall would take about two years. “More than anything, I have the safety and security of the Japanese people in mind,” Mr. Kan said. To brace for any shortfall in electricity, he called for Japanese citizens to do even more to conserve energy. Offices and factories in eastern Japan have already dimmed lights and altered operating hours after the government requested that they reduce their energy use by 15 percent this summer. The three operating reactors at Hamaoka have a combined capacity of about 3,500 megawatts, or about 7 percent of Japan’s nuclear power generating capacity. “I am certain that with an even stronger energy-saving effort by both local residents and the entire Japanese nation, we will overcome the power shortage,” he said. One of the three remaining reactors at Hamaoka had already been shut down for scheduled inspections. The company released a statement late Friday saying it would “promptly consider” Mr. Kan’s request. Environmental groups, including Greenpeace, quickly lauded Mr. Kan’s decision and urged the Japanese government to consider halting operations at all of the reactors in Japan, which is prone to earthquakes. “Greenpeace welcomes Prime Minister Kan’s request to close Hamaoka, one of the most dangerous nuclear reactors in Japan,” said Junichi Sato, the organization’s executive director in Japan. “The government must continue to close and decommission existing plants and cancel all new reactors,” he said. “Only then can the Japanese people feel their government is truly putting their safety first.” But Katsuhiko Ishibashi, a seismologist at Kobe University who has long argued for more stringent seismic standards for Japan’s nuclear power plants, said that simply halting operations at the Hamaoka plant was not enough. The reactors would remain vulnerable to quakes and tsunamis while they cooled down, he said, as would the spent fuel rods stored at the plant. “Work must be carried out immediately to make sure the plant is protected,” he said. He also said that the government had moved too slowly in recognizing the risks posed by earthquakes to the country’s nuclear reactors. In 2006, Mr. Ishibashi urged a government committee on which he served to adopt more stringent earthquake guidelines for nuclear power operators. He later resigned when his calls were ignored. “If Japan had faced up to the dangers earlier, we could have prevented Fukushima,” he said. At the Fukushima plant, workers have been struggling to bring the plant’s damaged reactors and fuel rod pools under control since the March 11 tsunami knocked out all power to the plant and shut down crucial cooling systems. Three of the reactors subsequently overheated and suffered hydrogen explosions. The plant is operated by the Tokyo Electric Power Company, known here as Tepco. Tepco has said it will take at least six to nine months to bring all of the plant’s reactors to a stable state known as a cold shutdown. Another nuclear plant operated by Tepco, the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power station on the coast of the Sea of Japan, was damaged in a magnitude-6.6 earthquake in 2007. Fire broke out at one of the reactors, though it was quickly put out, and Tepco officials said there had not been a widespread release of radioactive material. The plant was shut down for almost two years for repairs and inspections. Since then, four of its seven reactors have been restarted.",2011-05-06T18:33:38.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Approval, Shoreham Changes Hands","The Nuclear Regulatory Commission yesterday approved the transfer of the Shoreham nuclear plant from its builder, the Long Island Lighting Company, to the Long Island Power Authority, which plans to dismantle it. The approval is something of a postscript to a 25-year saga of tooth-and-nail combat between the utility, which spent $5.5 billion to build the plant, and opponents who swore from the start that it would never run. Until very late in the game, almost no one thought the reactor would be both completed and abandoned. In its decision yesterday, the commission voted 4 to 0 to approve the transfer of the plant's ""possession only"" license, after its staff had found that the Power Authority, which owns and operates two nuclear plants, was competent to hold the license. Lilco had won a low-power operating license for Shoreham, but it was reduced at Lilco's request to a license to hold nuclear fuel, which involves lower requirements for security and staffing. The approval came over the objections of the Shoreham-Wading River School District and Scientists and Engineers for Secure Energy, a New York City-based group, both of which favor operation of the reactor. Under a settlement between New York State and Lilco, the Long Island Power Authority is to buy the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station for $1, and the utility will get rate increases of about 5 percent a year for 10 years to restore it to financial health. The actual decommissioning work will be done by the New York Power Authority. Plans for decommissioning are not yet complete. But the plant is already inoperable, with key parts disassembled or spoiled and much of its staff dispersed. Actual control at the plant will change very little in the near future; employees of the New York Power Authority and the Long Island Power Authority are already based at Shoreham, and other workers from Lilco expect to continue working there for months to come. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said in a statement yesterday that he was pleased the commission approved the transfer. ""This license transfer is the cornerstone of my settlement to close and decommission the Shoreham plant and insure Long Island safe, affordable and reliable energy,"" the Governor said. Seeking Other Users Transfer of the license had also been opposed by the Federal Department of Energy, which argued that the plant's operation would cut oil imports and cause air pollution. The Bush Administration tried to take the issue to the Supreme Court last August, but the court refused to hear the case. But the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Ivan Selin, said yesterday that transfer of the license raised no significant public health or safety questions, so it could proceed. The actual transfer will be done by the commission staff in the next few days. The Long Island Power Authority, meanwhile, is seeking another use for the site, and has invited contractors to bid on using non-nuclear portions of the plant as part of a gas-fired generating station. The Long Island Lighting Company, which for years argued that without Shoreham, the lights would go out, is now lukewarm about putting a new generating station at the site, saying it would have to be weighed against the benefits of plants elsewhere or enhanced conservation efforts.",1992-02-27T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

So far the official objections have been from Massachusetts, which has six towns and a popular stretch of coastline within 10 miles of Seabrook. Last month Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said he would refuse to submit emergency plans in an effort to keep the plant from starting up. He said his decision had been influenced both by the nuclear accident last April at the Chernobyl power plant in the Soviet Union and by recent studies of potential dangers at the Seabrook facility. In granting the Seabrook license, an appeals panel of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the full board ruled in December 1984 that Shoreham could go ahead with fueling without a state-approved plan. The Long Island plant is fueled, and its operators say it is ready to run at full power, but it does not yet have a commission license for that. Massachusetts promised to appeal the Seabrook ruling, but the reactor's operator predicted that it would prevail. ''Seabrook station is probably the safest nuclear power plant that has ever been built,'' said Edward A. Brown, president and chief executive officer of New Hampshire Yankee.",1986-10-19T06:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,week-in-review-desk-week-in-review

The subsidies were included in an order from the Public Service Commission to establish new rules on how power consumed in the state is generated. The policy, championed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, calls for half of the state’s electricity to come from renewable sources, such as solar or wind, by 2030. Mr. Cuomo’s ambition to have New York seen as a national leader in reducing pollution from power generation has been complicated by the declining fortunes of the operators of nuclear plants. A long slump in the price of natural gas, a fuel for other generators, has hurt the profits of many nuclear plants, prompting plans to shut down some in New York. Exelon has said it may have to close its R. E. Ginna and Nine Mile Point nuclear plants unless it receives financial help from the state. Another company, Entergy, had said that it would close the James A. FitzPatrick plant , which neighbors Nine Mile Point on the shore of Lake Ontario in Oswego County, by early next year. Without those reactors, the state’s distributors of electricity would have to obtain more power from power plants fueled by gas and coal, which emit more carbon and would detract from the governor’s clean-energy goals, said Audrey Zibelman, the chairwoman of the commission. None of the subsidies will go to the Indian Point nuclear plant in Buchanan in Westchester County, Ms. Zibelman said. That plant, she said, “doesn’t have economic need” because electricity prices are much higher downstate. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has pressed federal regulators to shut down Indian Point, arguing that it is unsafe to operate nuclear reactors in a densely populated area so close to New York City. But Entergy, which operates Indian Point, has opposed those efforts. Although keeping the upstate plants running will produce more economic benefits in their local communities than in the New York City metropolitan area, Ms. Zibelman said, “the environmental benefits we’re looking to achieve are felt everywhere.” Mr. Cuomo praised the commission’s action, saying in a statement, “This Clean Energy Standard shows you can generate the power necessary for supporting the modern economy while combating climate change.” The commission said that starting in 2017, the subsidies would cost utility ratepayers in the state $962 million over two years. The overall cost of the clean energy program to utility customers would be less than $2 a month, it said. Ms. Zibelman said state officials had calculated the social and economic benefits of the program, including reduction of carbon emissions, lower prices for electricity and jobs in the power-generation industry, to be much greater than the cost. But some environmental groups, including the Alliance for a Green Economy in Syracuse, had opposed the subsidies, calling them possibly “the largest corporate bailout or subsidy” in state history. Jessica Azulay, program director for the group, said it supported the governor’s push to mandate the purchase of renewable energy by utilities but thought subsidies that could amount to several billion dollars over 12 years were a big mistake. “They’re dangerous, they’re aging, they’re unprofitable and they should close,” Ms. Azulay said of the nuclear plants. Exelon, which would collect the bulk of the subsidies, applauded the order. The company has pledged to invest about $200 million in its upstate plants next spring if the program is approved.",2016-08-02T04:16:04.000+02:00,NYTIMES,metro-new-york

Approves Plant,"To the Editor: To the Editor: ''The Energy Vandals'' (editorial, April 20) skews the responsibilities of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the Shoreham, L.I., nuclear-power plant case incorrectly and unfairly. Our mission, first and foremost, is to assess the safety aspects of nuclear power plants so as to provide reasonable assurance that public health and safety can and will be protected. To accomplish this important end, the agency has developed many requirements that must be met before we will license a nuclear power plant to operate. One requirement that we are required by law to make as part of our decision to license any plant is that there be adequate emergency planning. Rather than ''quailing'' before the issue and ''ambling'' to a decision, it was the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that took steps to address the very unusual situation created when, at the 11th hour after the plant was constructed, the Governor and local officials attempted to stop licensing of the plant by refusing to continue participation in the emergency planning process. However, despite this unusual situation, I believe the commission has acted responsibly to address all of the complex issues created by the Shoreham situation and to provide reasonable assurance for protection of the public health and safety. The N.R.C. moved to clarify its rules, in conformity with the direction of Congress, to provide that an acceptable utility plan for off-site emergency planning could be used in lieu of a state and local plan. Long Island Lighting Company developed such a plan. It was tested and found to be acceptable by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the N.R.C. technical staff. New York State and Suffolk County contested the adequacy of that plan in our hearing process. That was their right. The adjudication of those contentions took time, but surely, you would not want us to ignore the rights of any party. Contrary to your assertion, the state and county were dismissed from the N.R.C. proceedings for disobeying licensing board orders, for failing to respond to legitimate discovery requests and for abusing the hearing process. There were no simple answers to the precedent-setting emergency-planning issues created at Shoreham. Nevertheless, it was the N.R.C. that developed the framework that has allowed resolution of these issues. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has concluded that the Shoreham plant meets its requirements for a full-power operating license. Whether that license is used to operate Shoreham is a matter for Lilco and officials of New York State to decide. We agree with you that this plant can play an important role in helping to provide electric power for Long Island. LANDO W. ZECH JR.

The plant, which was completed early this year, will reprocess used fuel from nuclear power generators around the world, and has already accepted shipments of spent fuel from Japan. It is expected to produce as much as seven tons a year of plutonium, the primary material in a nuclear bomb, adding to a worldwide plutonium stockpile estimated by Greenpeace, the environmental group, at 150 tons. Along with a smaller operation in France, the new British plant, in Sellafield, in northwestern England, is one of only two in the world designed to reprocess nuclear fuel for nonmilitary purposes. The plutonium and uranium generated by the reprocessing are intended to be reused by nuclear power plants, although there is now a glut of the materials available on world markets and little new demand. Objections in Congress The Clinton Administration, which has stepped up efforts at curbing the spread of nuclear weapons, did not take a specific position on the British plant. But in a letter in October to Representative Pete Stark, a Democrat from California who has sought to halt the British plant, Mr. Clinton said the production of plutonium for civil uses ""is not justified on either economic or national security grounds, and its accumulation creates serious proliferation and security dangers."" Representative Stark is one of 36 members of Congress from the United States who have objected to the opening of the British plant, which is known as Thorp, for Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant. In announcing to the House of Commons today that the plant would be opened next month, the Environment Secretary, John Gummer, said the Government had weighed the risks as well as the benefits, which include supporting 1,200 jobs and meeting a potentially profitable demand for reprocessing from nuclear power plants.

This poses the interesting question of how you carried out your cost-benefit analysis. Aside from evaluating lives in dollars, the risk assessment of nuclear accidents is still an open subject. As a nuclear physicist, I bear not the slightest antagonism toward nuclear-power plants properly designed with safety considerations paramount. However, I am very uneasy about the resulting product when a design change from approximately 300 to 800 megawatts capacity (much more than double) was made in midstream of construction. This can't be done without sacrificing safety. Most nuclear-power experts agree that new nuclear-power plants should be situated far from congested areas. Certainly, Shoreham does not satisfy this criterion. The 10-mile evacuation radius is totally inadequate. Any-one who has returned to New York City on the Long Island Expressway on a summer Sunday afternoon knows that this would be a panic evacuation. ROBERT H.

Credit... Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters The Ukrainian military on Saturday reported renewed shelling at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant complex in southern Ukraine, hours after the European Union late Friday joined the United States in calling for a demilitarized zone to be created around the plant immediately. International concern has grown as shelling at the plant raises the risk of igniting a fire or causing other damage that could spiral out of control and lead to a nuclear accident. Ukraine has accused Russia of directing strikes there to cut off energy supplies to other cities and to try to discredit the Ukrainian military in the world’s eyes. The Russians say Ukraine is doing the shelling. In his nightly address on Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said the situation at the nuclear power plant was a threat to the rest of Europe, too. Every day that Russians forces occupy the plant and the region around it “increases the radiation threat to Europe so much that, even in the peak moments of the confrontation during the Cold War, this did not happen.” On Saturday, the Ukrainian military intelligence agency accused Russia of using the occupied town of Vodyane, which is near the plant, as a staging ground to shell the facility. They also accused Russia of planning a false-flag propaganda event to make it appear that the Ukrainians are responsible for the hostilities around the complex. The intelligence agency said that, among other things, Russian forces were flying Ukrainian flags in positions where their artillery was located. The claims could not be independently verified, but they reflect the Ukrainian belief that Russia is using the plant as a form of nuclear blackmail aimed at scaring the Ukrainians and their international allies about the consequences of any effort to reclaim land now occupied by Russia. At the same time, the Russian state media outlet Ria Novosti reported that Ukraine had launched an artillery attack on the plant, firing at least nine shells that landed near the complex. The report quoted a local official in Russia’s occupation administration. It could not be independently confirmed. It was not immediately clear what damage was caused by the renewed shelling on Saturday. Both sides would suffer if a meltdown occurred at the plant, Europe’s largest, and spread radioactive material. While such plants are designed to withstand a range of risk — from a plane crashing into the facility to natural disasters — no operating nuclear power plant has ever been in the middle of active fighting, and this one was not designed with the threat of cruise missiles in mind. The concrete shell of the site’s six reactors offer strong protection, as was the case when the No. 1 reactor was struck in March, officials say. More worrying is the chance that a power transformer is hit by shelling, raising the risk of a fire. If a fire were to break out at the power transformers and the electric network were taken offline, that could cause a breakdown of the plant’s cooling system and lead to a catastrophic meltdown, said Edwin Lyman, a nuclear power expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group in Cambridge, Mass. He noted that the loss of coolant during the Fukushima accident in Japan in 2011 had resulted in three reactors undergoing some degree of core meltdown. If the cooling is interrupted, Dr. Lyman said, the nuclear fuel could become hot enough to melt in a matter of hours. Eventually, it could melt through the steel reactor vessel and even the outer containment structure, releasing radioactive material.",2022-08-14T09:09:14.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

Earlier this month, the Federal commission granted the G.P.U. Nuclear Corporation, which operates the plant, permission to restart it after conducting an investigation about the improper closing of safety valves at the plant in Forked River, N.J. The investigation concluded that because the plant was temporarily shut down for repairs at the time, the closing of the valves posed minimal health risks to employees or area residents.

Opponents of nuclear power think they have a good chance to close the troubled Rancho Seco nuclear plant near Sacramento, Calif., in a local referendum tomorrow. If successful, the action could have significant ramifications for utilities that operate reactors like Rancho Seco, which is similar to one that experienced a partial core meltdown at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania nine years ago. It also would further undermine the nation's struggling nuclear power industry, which is troubled by high operating costs and frequent shutdowns. So concerned are some utilities that run similar reactors that at least one, the Duke Power Company, which operates in North and South Carolina, contributed money to defeat the referendum. The company, which donated $100,000, fears that losing the vote would set a precedent that could lead to a shutdown of other plants. Duke Power has even offered, for a fee, to run the Rancho Seco plant, where the management has been accused of tolerating sloppy operation. ''We are all in the nuclear boat together,'' said Mary T. Boyd, a spokeswoman for Duke. ''We all must perform well.'' Other Antinuclear Efforts The referendum is also troubling to other utilities that operate different types of reactors and face efforts to shut down their plants. Referendums have been brought by opponents of nuclear power in several states, most recently in Maine after the Chernobyl reactor accident in the Soviet Union. That drive, like all previous ones, was defeated. Reactor opponents will try in Massachusetts in November with a measure that could close the Pilgrim reactor, in Plymouth, owned by the Boston Edison Company, and Yankee Rowe, in Rowe, owned by a consortium of utilities. Opponents of nuclear power won a victory last month when New York State reached an agreement with the Long Island Lighting Company to abandon the Shoreham nuclear power plant. The Rancho Seco plant is a prime target for closure because it is one of the least reliable reactors in the nation. Mainly because of lengthy shutdowns, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, the plant's owner, has raised electric rates 83 percent in four years. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has attributed many of the problems to poor management. ''They made a life's work out of doing the bare minimum,'' said John B. Martin, the commission's regional administrator. Duke Power, which already operates three reactors in Seneca, S.C., said it could improve Rancho Seco's reliability. It offered to operate the Rancho Seco plant for $25 million a year, plus $1 million for each percentage point that reactor reliability rises above 50 percent. Mayor Favors a Shutdown Proponents of the shutdown, who have emphasized financial arguments, have won the support of the Mayor of Sacramento and other local officials. The general manager of the utility district, known as SMUD, also favors closing the 873-megawatt plant. But the directors of the district have put a second measure on the ballot that would let the plant operate for at least another 18 months. They contend that the utility's customers will save money over the long term if the plant can be run consistently. Polls have shown voters in Sacramento and the neighboring towns in the utility district are divided over closing the plant. The plant employs 940 SMUD workers, as well as 700 people who work for contractors. Babcock & Wilcox Plant Rancho Seco's main components were designed and built by Babcock & Wilcox, a subsidiary of McDermott International Inc. Other Babcock & Wilcox plants, which use a smaller volume of cooling water and are therefore more sensitive, have had a variety of mishaps. The most serious problem was the cooling water failure and undetected leak at the General Public Utilities Corporation's Three Mile Island facility near Harrisburg, Pa., that led to the partial melting of the nuclear core in 1979. Six years later, in June 1985, the system of pumps that provides cooling water failed at a plant of similar design, Davis-Besse in Oak Harbor, Ohio. The plant, owned by the Toledo Edison Company, was shut for 18 months. A study in November by the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission found that despite improvements in the Babcock & Wilcox reactors after the Three Mile Island accident, ''the number and complexity of events in plants with reactors designed by Babcock & Wilcox have not decreased as expected.'' The study also found that the loss of cooling water produces a ''more severe'' response in Babcock & Wilcox reactors than in those of other manufacturers because of their design. The study, based largely on engineering work done for the owners of the eight plants, concluded that they ''do not present unacceptable levels of risk, nor do they contain serious unidentified risk vulnerabilities.'' The Babcock & Wilcox plants have been the targets of the Union of Concerned Scientists. It argued last year that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's main safety studies examined only plants built by three other reactor manufacturers - the General Electric Company, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and Combustion Engineering Inc. - and that the level of safety of Babcock & Wilcox plants was unknown. The commission rejected the argument. A great deal of money has been invested in Rancho Seco. For example, $400 million was spent during the recent 27 months that it was shut down, and it cost $200 million more to buy replacement power from other utilities until the plant reopened in April. The utility has only 400,000 customers. SMUD directors and other supporters of the plant contend that this investment has created a reactor that will run reliably at low cost. But a panel appointed by SMUD recommended in February that Rancho Seco not be reopened because reliable operation was unlikely. Rancho Seco has had a poor operating record, producing over its lifetime less than 40 percent of the power that would have resulted had it run at full power. The average of power plants in the United States is about 60 percent. Rusted Water Valves One reason is the extended shutdowns for safety. In the incident in December 1985 that led to the 27-month shutdown, the system that supplies water to be boiled into steam (and also keeps the reactor from overheating) malfunctioned, pumping too fast. Instead of using controls in the control room to slow down the water flow, operators sent workers to close valves manually. But the valves were rusted open because they had not been lubricated since the plant opened. Operators cut off the water supply to the pumps. That led to a spill of 1,200 gallons of slightly radioactive water inside the plant and the release of a small amount of radioactive gas into the atmosphere. The 1985 accident was Rancho Seco's fifth overcooling incident. The plant is also known for a mishap in 1978, set off when a worker dropped a light bulb behind an instrument panel in the control room. That caused a short circuit and a blackout in the control room, activating the emergency pumps. ''In the past at Rancho Seco,'' said Robert Pollard, the chief reactor expert of the Union of Concerned Scientists, ''one of the biggest problems was, in their short-term economic interest, they didn't do any of the routine maintenance and preventive maintenance. Basically, they operated on the theory if it ain't broke, don't fix it.''",1988-06-06T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business

Administration officials confirmed that their 2011 federal budget request next week would raise potential loan guarantees for the projects to more than $54 billion, from $18.5 billion. A new Energy Department panel will examine a vastly expanded list of options for nuclear waste, including a new kind of nuclear reactor that would use some of it. The current loan guarantees were provided in the 2005 energy act but have not been disbursed because of bureaucratic delays. The Energy Department has said it would start issuing those soon. Because the loan guarantees are supposed to cover 80 percent of construction costs, the current amount of $18.5 billion would cover only about three projects. Energy Secretary Steven Chu has been saying for weeks that the administration would seek a greater amount of guarantees; commercial investment has been hard to come by because there is so much uncertainty about the cost and schedule for building plants. When President Obama said in his State of the Union address on Wednesday that the country should build “a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants,” it was one of the few times he got bipartisan applause. The idea may have more support among Republicans than Democrats, but even opponents of nuclear power concede that the loan guarantees may be necessary to muster enough votes for the kind of measures that many environmentalists favor in a climate and energy bill, like firm national goals for renewable energy and a cap on carbon dioxide emissions. In theory, the federal government could profit from the guarantees by collecting fees from power plant builders if profits from the reactors allowed utilities to repay the loans. But some experts are predicting a repeat of the experience of the 1980s, in which the costs of many projects soared until they became prohibitive and the plants were abandoned before completion. Opponents have complained that loan guarantees for projects that cannot attract commercial investment amounted to “nuclear socialism.” Companies that want to build reactors are also hoping to cobble together loan guarantees from the governments of France and Japan, which are home to businesses that want to sell reactor components. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission intends to begin issuing licenses for new reactors late next year, at which point financing would be a crucial issue. Beyond cost, another big problem for the industry is nuclear waste. Mr. Obama has ruled out the use of Yucca Mountain, a site in Nevada chosen by Congress more than 20 years ago as the leading candidate for a burial site for the waste, some of which will remain dangerous for millenniums. Mr. Chu said Friday that the Energy Department’s new blue-ribbon commission on nuclear waste would consider “interim” storage options, which are forbidden under current law, and evaluate new technologies that could make some use of nuclear waste. The commission is to be led by Lee H. Hamilton, a former Democratic congressman from Indiana and co-chairman of the Sept. 11 commission, and Brent Scowcroft, a retired Air Force general and former national security adviser who has specialized in nuclear proliferation issues. The panel’s members will also include Richard A. Meserve, a former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; John W. Rowe, the chairman and chief executive of Exelon, a major nuclear utility; Pete V. Domenici, a former Republican senator from New Mexico; Ernest Moniz, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology physicist and former under secretary of energy; and Alison Macfarlane, a geochemist with a specialty in nuclear issues. Officials said the commission had been told not to find an alternate site for the burial of nuclear waste.",2010-01-30T03:32:30.000+01:00,NYTIMES,national-science-environment

Those rules, which are often contradictory, leave the commission without the muscle to enforce the federal law requiring the reporting of such problems, the inspector general said in a report issued Wednesday. From December 2009 to September 2010, the report said, the commission found 24 instances in which equipment problems were not properly reported. If the rules are not improved, it said, they “could reduce the margin of safety for operating nuclear power reactors.” The commission, which operates independently of the inspector general, countered in a statement that it “has a variety of other regulations that effectively encompass reporting all defects.” It added, “The N.R.C. continues to conclude plants are operating safely.” The inspector general’s office said it was concerned about equipment involving safety features — for instance, systems that measure pressure in a reactor’s coolant.  But the report did not detail any specific lapses in reporting equipment problems. R. K. Wild, a senior analyst in the inspector general’s office, said Thursday that  full reporting of equipment defects was crucial to ensuring that problems were not duplicated at other plants. When a plant operator reports a problem, the government can take the information to the manufacturer and determine where similar parts are in use.  Nuclear power generation in the United States has come under more scrutiny since an earthquake and tsunami struck a nuclear plant in Japan, setting off a crisis that continues to unfold. At the request of President Obama, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted Wednesday to set up a task force to review the safety of the 104 nuclear reactors operating across the United States. In another development, federal authorities announced Thursday that a subcontractor at the Watts Bar nuclear plant under construction in Tennessee had been accused of lying about making crucial measurements on cables that carry power to safety systems there. The contractor, Matthew David Correll, 31, was charged with making false statements, the United States attorney in Knoxville, Tenn., said.

Weinberg, a top nuclear scientist and leading advocate for commercial nuclear power who helped steer the Oak Ridge National Laboratory throughout the cold war, died on Wednesday in his home in Oak Ridge, Tenn. He was 91. Dr. Weinberg's death was confirmed by his family. From 1955 to 1973, he was director of the Oak Ridge laboratory, where he coined the term ''Big Science'' to describe the advent of nuclear power and other huge technological projects invariably financed by governments and powerful research institutions. The laboratory among other things made crucial parts for weapons in the nation's nuclear arsenal. In the 1970's and earlier, Dr. Weinberg continually emphasized the viability -- and the necessity -- of commercial reactors, even after a watershed nuclear accident at Three Mile Island, near Harrisburg, Pa., where a plant malfunction caused a low-level release of radiation in 1979. He argued for better pay and more intensive training for reactor workers and proposed that nuclear plants be operated by a federal entity, instead of being entrusted to commercial utilities. At the time, Dr. Weinberg noted that Three Mile Island might become the ''salvation of nuclear energy,'' since a large-scale meltdown had been averted, and therefore should increase public confidence in the safety of commercial reactors. He cited a climbing demand for electricity in the United States, a relative scarcity of oil and pervasive pollution caused by burning coal as prime reasons for increasing the role of nuclear generation. In an interview at Oak Ridge in 1995, Dr. Weinberg conceded that ''one of the prices of nuclear energy is the commitment of certain pieces of real estate in perpetuity to nuclear activity, including waste disposal.'' He added, ''This is not all that big a commitment, because there are only 85 reactor sites and 50 other nuclear-related sites throughout the United States.'' As early as 1945, he foresaw the advantage of nuclear energy to power fleets of submarines, to extend American naval influence into the Arctic and regions similarly remote. Dr. Weinberg's opinions on energy were frequently sought by federal lawmakers, and he served on presidential science advisory committees in the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon administrations. Although he stepped down from his post at Oak Ridge, he continued to advise the federal government on technology and energy policies. In 1975, he helped to found the Institute for Energy Analysis at Oak Ridge Associated Universities, a federal consortium, and initiated studies of reactor safety, carbon dioxide emissions and other subjects related to national energy use. At the institute, where he was director until 1985, he advocated increasing the number of commercial reactors as a means of cutting emissions of heat-trapping gases. With Eugene P. Wigner, Dr. Weinberg wrote a textbook on reactor operations, ''The Physical Theory of Neutron Chain Reactors'' (1958). He also wrote extensively about defense and arms control, and chronicled his role in a memoir, ''The First Nuclear Era: The Life and Times of a Nuclear Fixer'' (1997). Earlier, he wrote about his experiences in another book, ''Reflections on Big Science'' (1969). Alvin Martin Weinberg was born in Chicago. He earned his doctorate in mathematical biophysics from the University of Chicago in 1939. After working on atomic development at the University of Chicago, he joined Oak Ridge as the laboratory's research director in 1948. In the following decades, he helped to oversee research on the use of isotopes in nuclear medicine, the effects of radiation exposure on humans and the environmental impact of energy generation. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. Dr. Weinberg's first wife, the former Margaret Despres, died in 1969. He later married Genevieve DePersio, who died in 2004. He is survived by a son, Dr. Richard J. Weinberg, a biologist, of Durham, N.C.; a sister, Fay Goleman of Stockton, Calif.; and three grandchildren. Correction: November 3, 2006, Friday Because of an editing error, an obituary on Oct. 21 about Alvin M.

Pete V. Domenici, then a Republican senator from New Mexico, was looking for an issue to claim as his own. One staff member, a former scientist at the Los Alamos nuclear lab, tossed out an idea that seemed dead on arrival: a renewed commitment to nuclear energy. “Are you serious?” Mr. Domenici remembers asking the aide incredulously. After Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, nuclear energy had fallen into disfavor, development had stalled, and many politicians ran from the issue like it was a toxic cloud. But with industry backing, Mr. Domenici overcame his skepticism and became one of the driving forces in a decade-long renaissance of nuclear energy — a resurgence that began in earnest under President George W. Bush and has led President Obama to seek a $36 billion expansion in loan guarantees to finance reactors at a time when other programs are being slashed. Now, however, the future of nuclear energy in the United States is in doubt, with advocates on all sides bracing for a fierce debate over whether the disaster in Japan should slow or even derail the planned expansion of America’s 104 nuclear reactors. Mr. Obama has shown no sign of backing away — a testament to the success of an expensive multiyear campaign by the nuclear energy industry, advocates in Congress and the executive branch. Nuclear executives, girding for a fight, have already held 20 briefings for Washington lawmakers and others about the events in Japan and the potential lessons learned at home. They have been putting out guidance on increased safeguards for reactors, and giving reporters tours of nuclear plants. The message: Despite the events in Japan, nuclear is a safe, affordable and “clean” energy source that does not spew harmful carbons into the environment or rely on foreign producers. “We surely should avoid a rush to judgment,” Jeff Merrifield , a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said in one of a series of videos that the Nuclear Energy Institute, the leading trade group, has put out on its Web site since this month’s tsunami crippled Japan’s reactors. The United States, he said, should “continue to move forward with building those plants because it’s the right thing for our nation.” But with polls in the last two weeks showing dimmed support for nuclear power, opponents are hoping to use the events in Japan to slow the industry’s political momentum and challenge what the industry maintains is a long record of safety. “The risk is just so great if there’s a screw-up,” said David Hamilton, director of energy programs for the Sierra Club, which opposes the expansion of nuclear energy. “The nuclear renaissance was already hanging by a thread, and the Japanese disaster may have cut the thread.” But even the critics acknowledge that the industry’s backers have managed to jump-start nuclear energy in a way that few thought possible a decade ago. One turning point, people on both sides of the issue agree, was that proponents took advantage of the public concern over climate change and carbon-producing fuels beginning in the early 2000s and were able to recast themselves — first to fence-sitting lawmakers, then to the public as a whole — as a “clean” alternative that would not harm the environment. “It was a brilliant campaign,” said Tyson Slocum, an energy expert at Public Citizen , which opposes nuclear energy because of concerns about its safety, security and cost. “While everyone was focused on shutting down coal plants, they had a couple of years to themselves to just talk to the American public in very sophisticated ad campaigns and to reintroduce a generation of Americans to nuclear power,” he said. “That was very powerful.” Nuclear industry firms and their employees also contributed more than $4.6 million in the last decade to members of Congress — both Republicans and Democrats, including Mr. Obama, then a senator, and his presidential campaign — as the industry’s political fortunes were rising, according to an analysis by MAPLight.org, a Washington research group that tracks money and politics. And the industry has spent tens of millions more lately on lobbying. Last year, electric utilities, trade groups and other backers spent $54 million hiring lobbyists, including former members of Congress, to make their case, according to a separate analysis by the Sunlight Foundation , which also tracks money and politics. As a senator, Mr. Domenici was a big beneficiary of the industry’s largess, collecting more than $1.25 million over his 20-year career from political donors affiliated with the energy sector. Months after he committed himself to promoting nuclear energy, he gave a talk on the topic in 1997 at Harvard University called “A New Nuclear Paradigm.” Nuclear energy proponents called it a seminal moment in the shift of public opinion. “I wanted to put nuclear power in its proper perspective,” said Mr. Domenici, who left the Senate in 2009 and serves as a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. “You have this resource just sitting there saying, ‘Are you going to use me or not?’ ” Mr. Domenici said in an interview last week. “People were stirring up fears of another Three Mile Island, but I believe the reality of nuclear power has now become much better known.” Mr. Domenici’s position as a senior member of both the Senate Energy and Appropriations Committees gave him a particularly influential role in helping the industry. He was at Mr. Bush’s side in 2005, when the president signed a major bill that encouraged the building of new nuclear plants. Work has now begun on four new plants. Mr. Domenici’s former aides have gone on to play critical roles in the debate as well. Pete Lyons , a nuclear scientist and the former Domenici aide who first suggested the nuclear energy idea to the senator at his 1997 brainstorming session, went on to serve on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and has been nominated by Mr. Obama to run the Energy Department’s civilian nuclear program. Alex Flint , another Domenici aide at the meeting, now is the chief federal lobbyist for the Nuclear Energy Institute. And a third aide at the meeting, Steve Bell , assists Mr. Domenici’s work on a presidential panel on nuclear waste. Mr. Flint said the senator’s staff did not expect to succeed when Mr. Domenici began proposing modest appropriations for nuclear research and programming in the late 1990s. “We were going against the conventional wisdom,” Mr. Flint said. “We expected a pushback, but we didn’t get it. And it just grew from there.” Within the Energy Department, meanwhile, a 2003 study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on the future of nuclear energy helped forge a consensus within the government, even among skeptical policy makers, officials said. The study concluded that while nuclear power was facing “stagnation and decline,” it should remain an important way to provide carbon-free energy at relatively low cost. “That really moved my thinking, and that kind of analysis was very influential,” said Daniel B. Poneman , deputy secretary at the Energy Department. Today, there is no doubt about where the Energy Department stands. Its Web site extols the value of nuclear energy as providing “low-cost, carbon-free electricity to help drive the American economy and preserve the environment,” and it even includes a special page for children called “ the Power Pack ,” featuring a sci-fi journey through nuclear energy. For critics urging a go-slow approach to building reactors, the enthusiasm is all a bit much. “The industry has really embedded itself in the political establishment,” said Mr. Slocum at Public Citizen. “They’ve had reliable friends from George Bush to Barack Obama, and the government has really just become cheerleaders for the industry.” Whether events in Japan change the political calculus in Washington “is what everyone is waiting to see,” he said. “We don’t want to be seen as exploiting a tragedy, but it’s prudent to talk about the implications here. The best and the brightest can’t see around every corner.”",2011-03-25T04:15:47.000+01:00,NYTIMES,national-u.s.

The team intends to establish a permanent monitoring mission at the Russian-occupied nuclear facility. Credit Credit... Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times KYIV, Ukraine — A team of international nuclear experts made its way toward an imperiled nuclear plant in Ukraine on Wednesday morning from Kyiv, the capital, heading south toward the front lines where fighting has intensified in recent weeks. The group includes 14 experts with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog. They set off from Kyiv on Wednesday morning after a news conference outlining one of the most complicated missions in the agency’s history. The I.A.E.A. has also worked in Iraq, Iran and North Korea. A senior Ukrainian official warned that many challenges remained as the group made its way to the plant. One of the biggest obstacles will be finding safe passage through an active battlefield to the Russian-occupied facility. To reach the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the team must negotiate the craters and trenches of the front lines and enter an area where frequent shelling has raised fears of a nuclear catastrophe. The team could reach the front line between Russian and Ukrainian forces as early as Wednesday afternoon. “As you know, we have a very, very important task there to perform, to assess the real situation there, to help stabilize the situation as much as we can,” the I.A.E.A. director general, Rafael Grossi, told reporters in Kyiv early Wednesday before departing in a convoy of armored S.U.V. vehicles. Monitors intended to spend several days in the Russian-occupied nuclear facility, and will seek to establish a permanent monitoring mission at the plant, Mr. Grossi said. “After six months of steady efforts, the I.A.E.A. is moving in to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,” he said. Before the experts set out for the nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, they tried to broker some kind of deal with the two militaries. Fighting is intensifying in the south, where Ukraine is escalating strikes in what could be part of broader counteroffensive. By early Wednesday, Mr. Grossi said the mission had secured safety guarantees from both the Russian and Ukrainian militaries, though dangers lingered. “We are going to a war zone, we are going to occupied territory,” he said. Both Russia, whose forces seized the plant not long after invading, and Ukraine, whose military holds positions only a few miles away, say they support the I.A.E.A. mission. But they have disagreed on how it should be carried out. Russian officials have ignored pleas to withdraw from the facility to create a demilitarized zone around it. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine’s president, said in an interview on Tuesday that key aspects of the negotiations were in question, among them the route to the facility. He said he was still hopeful, however, that the monitors would reach the plant “one way or another.”",2022-08-31T08:34:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

The chairman, Ivan Selin, who is 57, said that in his four-year tenure, the commission had completed the overhaul of the licensing process for new plants, so that if any more are ordered, which has not happened in nearly 20 years, they could fairly compete with other kinds of generating stations. He did not say any more orders were likely. Of his own decision, he said hardly anyone wanted to make a big capital investment now in a new generating station. The country is ""awash in electricity,"" he said, and the utilities face tremendous uncertainty as the industry is deregulated. As a result, he said, the market is choosing plants that can be built inexpensively and operated only part of the day, even if they cost more per hour to run. Gas-burning plants fit that description perfectly, and in recent years have achieved very high levels of efficiency. ""What's going on in gas turbines is unbelievable,"" he said. Dr. Selin, who founded a computer firm in 1970 before coming to the State Department in 1989 and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1991, said he liked his job as chairman but wanted to go into the power-production business with his son, Douglas, 31, who is director of international investment at the office of the United States Trade Representative. James P. Riccio, a nuclear expert at Critical Mass, a nuclear safety group affiliated with Ralph Nader, said Dr. Selin's decision was telling. ""The man who has been trying to bail out the nuclear industry economically has decided he's going to go sell gas-fired turbines,"" he said. Dr. Selin said, though, that he would forgo working in the private nuclear business because he was a nuclear regulator. He also said that he wanted to be in private business but that most nuclear programs in Asia were run by governments. He said his company would seek contracts for long-term electricity sales in countries like India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. He said the nuclear industry in the United States was in a better position for recovery than it was when he took office because the commission had completed procedures for generic certifications of completed plant designs. In the construction of nuclear plants in past decades, designers worked half a step ahead of construction crews and regulators then decided whether what had been done was acceptable, leading to delays and ""rework."" ""I'm not predicting that the nuclear industry will pick up,"" he said. But electric companies will return to ordering big power stations at some point, he said, and with licensing reform and a better thought-out design process, he said, ""the industry will make decisions based on longer-term economics."" Asked about the long-term role for various energy technologies, he said, ""I believe in our lifetimes, maybe even our children's lifetimes, at least half the electricity in the United States will continue to come from combustion of coal."" Renewable sources, like geothermal energy, he said, might be important in some regions but ""I don't expect renewables will make a significant dent"" in the three leading sources of electricity, which are coal, nuclear power and natural gas.",1995-03-15T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

Critics of the industry charged after the nuclear accident at the Soviet Union's Chernobyl power plant in April that the containment systems used at 24 United States plants resembled the Chernobyl containment facility. Both systems limit pressure buildup inside the containment unit by using pools of water to capture steam released into the facility by broken pipes.",1986-11-06T06:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,national-desk-u.s.

To the Editor: Re ''Nukes Are Green'' (column, April 9): Nicholas D. Kristof's endorsement of nuclear power as a less risky choice than fossil fuels for America's energy future makes sense if three conditions can be met. First, the public must believe that nuclear power generation can be safely regulated. An editorial the same day about the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's failure to acknowledge safety concerns at existing reactor pools (''Terrorist Attacks on Reactor Pools'') only deepens distrust. Second, for the nuclear option to be seriously considered, a site for a secure waste facility must be in place and safe waste transportation ensured. The development of a Nevada waste site has faced unparalleled opposition for years. And third, nuclear energy can be pursued only as part of an overall energy policy of conservation, efficiency and alternative-generation fuels and methods.

In disclosing the agreement during a four-day visit to Beijing, President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran said that there were no plans for new military agreements between the two countries, and Chinese officials emphasized that Iran had agreed to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect the nuclear power plant. China is currently building a small nuclear research reactor for Iran in Isfahan, and has provided it with a mini-calutron, a small version of the machine that Iraq was mass-producing as one component of its nuclear weapons program. The new plant would have to be a much larger, 300-megawatt reactor to produce electricity. Because it would be subject to international inspection, any diversion of nuclear fuel into a weapons program would be be easy to prevent. Still Closer Cooperation But the undertaking would solidify Iran's already close technical cooperation with China, which Mr. Rafsanjani said he hoped would expand. ""Our cooperation with China has constantly been increasing,"" he said at a news conference today. He added that his visit to China ""will help to enhance our cooperation and make it more comprehensive in many new areas."" The project would also significantly enhance Iran's nuclear capability and inject dozens, perhaps hundreds, of Chinese nuclear experts into Iran. It could also help Iran develop related processes that could directly help a nuclear weapons program. ""The actual installation may never be misused,"" said Leonard S. Spector, a nuclear weapons expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""China and Iran are both adhering to the letter of their non-proliferation obligations, but the transfer will enhance Iran's nuclear capability, create new skills and provide a cover for it."" In 1990, Iran and China signed a 10-year agreement for scientific cooperation and the transfer of military equipment and technology. Both Governments have repeatedly emphasized that their nuclear cooperation is for peaceful purposes and an inspection of Iran's nuclear installations by the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency this year found no evidence of nuclear weapons research. But the United States and other Western governments are convinced that Iran is intent on developing nuclear weapons with the help of technology from China. In testimony before Congress in February, Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, said that Iran was looking to China to supply missiles and nuclear technology as part of an effort to develop its military capability. The Bush Administration is opposed to any nation helping Iran develop a nuclear program, whether peaceful or not, and has repeatedly urged China to stop cooperating with Iran in its nuclear program. Both countries are parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but the Administration has repeatedly expressed doubts about Iran's intentions to live up to the treaty. Iran is aggressively shopping for nuclear-related technology, including equipment like computers and fuses, and has tried to attract nuclear scientists to Iran, foreign diplomats in Teheran say. When Iran tried to buy enriched uranium that was not compatible with peaceful nuclear purposes from Argentina, for example, the United States successfully pressed the Argentines to cancel the deal. U.S.-China Ties Strained Disclosure of the nuclear plant agreement coincides with increasingly strained relations between Washington and Beijing following a decision by the Bush Administration to sell up to 150 advanced F-16 fighter planes to Taiwan. Mr. Rafsanjani was accompanied to Beijing by the Iranian Defense Minister, Akbar Torkan, and other military officials. Neither he nor Chinese officials disclosed the financial details of the deal, and some Administration officials speculated that the announcement today might represent only a vague agreement in principle. Earlier this week, the Itar-Tass news agency reported that Russia would be willing to sign an agreement to build two to four 440-megawatt nuclear power plants in Iran.",1992-09-11T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

Credit... Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York Times The U.N.’s nuclear watchdog agency will implement a plan this week to station inspectors at each of Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants in a bid to reduce the chances of a nuclear accident amid the country’s war with Russia. “As this tragic war enters its second year, we must continue to do everything we can to avert the danger of a serious nuclear accident that would cause even more suffering and destruction for the people of Ukraine and beyond,” the agency’s director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said in a statement issued on Friday. He said he would visit Ukraine this week, the latest in a series of trips. Most of the attention on the country’s nuclear sector during the conflict has focused on the Zaporizhzhia facility, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, which is occupied by Russian forces and became an effective battle zone over the summer. Russian forces used the plant’s grounds to fire rockets at nearby towns and cities, according to Ukrainian authorities, while both sides have blamed each other for a series of explosions at the sprawling site that have forced engineers to shut down the plant’s six reactors. Inspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is based in Vienna, have been stationed at the Zaprorizhzhia plant since September. But Ukraine has three other plants in Rivne, South Ukraine and Khmelnytskyi, and the agency aims to station experts at all of them. “Our nuclear safety and security experts will monitor the situation at the plants, assess their equipment and other needs, provide technical support and advice, and report their findings to I.A.E.A. headquarters,” Mr. Grossi said in the statement. The agency said it planned to stage 11 or 12 of its experts in the country at any given time. The agency would also have a permanent presence at Chernobyl, the closed plant in northern Ukraine that, in 1986, was the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident. Russian forces occupied Chernobyl for several weeks shortly after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February. In October, Russia began a campaign to cripple Ukraine’s energy sector by hitting power plants and other infrastructure with long range missiles and exploding drones. In November, Ukrainian authorities simultaneously disconnected all four nuclear plants from the country’s power grid as a precaution after Russian attacks damaged the energy systems that supplied them. Ukraine’s state energy company, Energoatom, said in a statement on Saturday that Russia was stationing troops and munitions in the basements of residential buildings in Enerhodar, a city near the Zaprorizhzhia nuclear plant that serves as home to many of the plant’s workers. In a statement on the Telegram social messaging app, Energoatom decried the move, adding that Russian forces knew that Ukraine would be reluctant to target residential buildings for fear of killing civilians. Some military experts say that Ukraine could launch its next offensive in Zaporizhzhia Province with the aim of recapturing the southern city of Melitopol, putting pressure on the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia has controlled since 2014, and severing a land bridge that Moscow has established along the Ukrainian coast from Crimea to the Donbas region in the east of the country. To forestall that possibility, according to witnesses and military experts, Russia has been ferrying reinforcements into the part of Zaporizhzhia close to the nuclear plant. In his statement, Mr. Grossi said that an I.A.E.A. plan to establish a safety and security zone around Zaporizhzhia was “making progress, albeit not as fast as they should” and that he would hold talks on the matter with senior Ukrainian officials. Mr. Grossi has also held talks in Moscow about the plan.",2023-01-16T18:30:54.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, was reacting to an assertion by Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Tuesday that Moscow had not completed its latest test series, as the United States contends, but had interrupted testing to announce its moratorium. The Soviet halt is to last until the end of the year, subject to indefinite extension if the United States were to join in. The White House spokesman said the Soviet Union, before announcing the halt, had finished testing and deploying an ''entire generation of new missiles, the SS-18's, SS-19's and SS-20's.'' In addition, he said, it did substantial testing on SS-24's and SS-25's. Mr. Speakes also reacted to Mr. Gorbachev's assertion that a halt in testing was verifiable by existing technical means. Testing has been limited to underground explosions since 1963, when an international treaty prohibited nuclear blasts in the atmosphere, under water and in outer space. U.S. Disputes Verifiability ''We welcome his recognition of the importance of the verification question in any serious discussion of nuclear testing,'' Mr. Speakes said. ''It is our opinion, in the absence of on-site inspection, that the margin of error in verifying the limitations on nuclear testing is quite substantial.'' The United States contends that historically the Soviet Union has announced moratoriums at a time of advantage in testing. American officials say the latest testing halt is intended to divert attention from what the United States views as a Soviet buildup. Meanwhile, President Reagan spent most of the day relaxing on his ranch nearby, with the morning devoted to paperwork and the afternoon to a meeting with Vice President Bush. Mr. Bush and his wife, Barbara, were in southern California for ceremonies on the aircraft carrier Enterprise marking the victory over Japan in 1945. Mr. Reagan is using a part of the vacation here to recover from abdominal surgery in which a cancerous polyp was removed. Mr. Speakes said the President had received 47,439 pieces of mail with get-well wishes and 500 gifts. ----Soviet Identifies Reactor MOSCOW, Aug. 14 (Reuters) - The head of the Soviet Union's nuclear power program confirmed today that inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna would visit Soviet reactors soon. It will be the first time the Soviet Union has opened up its civilian nuclear plants to inspection. The Soviet official, Gennadi A. Veretennikov, said the inspectors would visit a nuclear power station at Novovoronezhsky, south of Voronezh, in central European Russia, and a research reactor that he would not identify. Mr. Veretennikov, a former economic planning official, has been a Deputy Minister of Electric Power since August 1983, in charge of the nuclear power agency, known by the Russian acronym Soyuzatomenergo. The Novovoronezhsky station, with five power reactors of the pressurized water type, is one of the oldest civilian nuclear stations in the Soviet Union. Its first reactor, with an electrical capacity of 210 megawatts, started up in 1964. The fifth reactor, a 1,000 megawatt unit opened in 1980, brought station capacity to about 2,500 megawatts.",1985-08-15T09:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world
6530a701-8353-4b96-aae6-44c4f6a5ed7c,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/business/energy-environment/29nuke.html,"Not So Fast, Nukes","OLKILUOTO, Finland  As the Obama administration tries to steer America toward cleaner sources of energy, it would do well to consider the cautionary tale of this new-generation nuclear reactor site. The massive power plant under construction on muddy terrain on this Finnish island was supposed to be the showpiece of a nuclear renaissance. The most powerful reactor ever built, its modular design was supposed to make it faster and cheaper to build. And it was supposed to be safer, too. But things have not gone as planned. After four years of construction and thousands of defects and deficiencies, the reactor’s 3 billion euro price tag, about $4.2 billion, has climbed at least 50 percent. And while the reactor was originally meant to be completed this summer, Areva, the French company building it, and the utility that ordered it, are no longer willing to make certain predictions on when it will go online. While the American nuclear industry has predicted clear sailing after its first plants are built, the problems in Europe suggest these obstacles may be hard to avoid. A new fleet of reactors would be standardized down to “the carpeting and wallpaper,” as Michael J. Wallace, the chairman of UniStar Nuclear Energy  a joint venture between EDF Group and Constellation Energy, the Maryland-based utility  has said repeatedly. In the end, he says, that standardization will lead to significant savings. But early experience suggests these new reactors will be no easier or cheaper to build than the ones of a generation ago, when cost overruns  and then accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl  ended the last nuclear construction boom. In Flamanville, France, a clone of the Finnish reactor now under construction is also behind schedule and overbudget. In the United States, Florida and Georgia have changed state laws to raise electricity rates so that consumers will foot some of the bill for new nuclear plants in advance, before construction even begins. “A number of U.S. companies have looked with trepidation on the situation in Finland and at the magnitude of the investment there,” said Paul L. Joskow, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a co-author of an influential report on the future of nuclear power in 2003. “The rollout of new nuclear reactors will be a good deal slower than a lot of people were assuming.” For nuclear power to have a high impact on reducing greenhouse gases, an average of 12 reactors would have to be built worldwide each year until 2030, according to the Nuclear Energy Agency at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Right now, there are not even enough reactors under construction to replace those that are reaching the end of their lives. And of the 45 reactors being built around the world, 22 have encountered construction delays, according to an analysis prepared this year for the German government by Mycle Schneider, an energy analyst and a critic of the nuclear industry. He added that nine do not have official start-up dates. Most of the new construction is underway in countries like China and Russia, where strong central governments have made nuclear energy a national priority. India also has long seen nuclear as part of a national drive for self-sufficiency and now is seeking new nuclear technologies to reduce its reliance on imported uranium. By comparison, “the state has been all over the place in the United States and Europe on nuclear power,” Mr. Joskow said. The United States generates about one-fifth of its electricity from a fleet of 104 reactors, most built in the 1960s and 1970s. Coal still provides about half the country’s power. To streamline construction, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Washington has worked with the industry to approve a handful of designs. Even so, the schedule to certify the most advanced model from Westinghouse, a unit of Toshiba, has slipped during an ongoing review of its ability to withstand the impact of an airliner. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has also not yet approved the so-called EPR design under construction in Finland for the American market. This month, the United States Energy Department produced a short list of four reactor projects eligible for some loan guarantees. In the 2005 energy bill, Congress provided $18.5 billion, but the industry’s hope of winning an additional $50 billion worth of loan guarantees evaporated when that money was stripped from President Obama’s economic stimulus bill. The industry has had more success in getting states to help raise money. This year, authorities permitted Florida Power & Light to start charging millions of customers several dollars a month to finance four new reactors. Customers of Georgia Power, a subsidiary of the Southern Co., will pay on average $1.30 a month more in 2011, rising to $9.10 by 2017, to help pay for two reactors expected to go online in 2016 or later. But resistance is mounting. In April, Missouri legislators balked at a preconstruction rate increase, prompting the state’s largest electric utility, Ameren UE, to suspend plans for a $6 billion copy of Areva’s Finnish reactor. Areva, a conglomerate largely owned by the French state, is heir to that nation’s experience in building nuclear plants. France gets about 80 percent of its power from 58 reactors. But even France has not completed a new reactor since 1999. After designing an updated plant originally called the European Pressurized Reactor with German participation during the 1990s, the French had trouble selling it at home because of a saturated energy market as well as opposition from Green Party members in the then-coalition government. So Areva turned to Finland, where utilities and energy-hungry industries like pulp and paper had been lobbying for 15 years for more nuclear power. The project was initially budgeted at $4 billion and Teollisuuden Voima, the Finnish utility, pledged it would be ready in time to help the Finnish government meet its greenhouse gas targets under the Kyoto climate treaty, which runs through 2012. Areva promised electricity from the reactor could be generated more cheaply than from natural gas plants. Areva also said its model would deliver 1,600 megawatts, or about 10 percent of Finnish power needs. In 2001, the Finnish parliament narrowly approved construction of a reactor at Olkiluoto, an island on the Baltic Sea. Construction began four years later. Serious problems first arose over the vast concrete base slab for the foundation of the reactor building, which the country’s Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority found too porous and prone to corrosion. Since then, the authority has blamed Areva for allowing inexperienced subcontractors to drill holes in the wrong places on a vast steel container that seals the reactor. In December, the authority warned Anne Lauvergeon, the chief executive of Areva, that “the attitude or lack of professional knowledge of some persons” at Areva was holding up work on safety systems. Today, the site still teems with 4,000 workmen on round-the-clock shifts. Banners from dozens of subcontractors around Europe flutter in the breeze above temporary offices and makeshift canteens. Some 10,000 people speaking at least eight different languages have worked at the site. About 30 percent of the workforce is Polish, and communication has posed significant challenges. Areva has acknowledged that the cost of a new reactor today would be as much as 6 billion euros, or $8 billion, double the price offered to the Finns. But Areva said it was not cutting any corners in Finland. The two sides have agreed to arbitration, where they are both claiming more than 1 billion euros in compensation. (Areva blames the Finnish authorities for impeding construction and increasing costs for work it agreed to complete at a fixed price.) Areva announced a steep drop in earnings last year, which it blamed mostly on mounting losses from the project. In addition, nuclear safety inspectors in France have found cracks in the concrete base and steel reinforcements in the wrong places at the site in Flamanville. They also have warned Électricité de France, the utility building the reactor, that welders working on the steel container were not properly qualified. On top of such problems come the recession, weaker energy demand, tight credit and uncertainty over future policies, said Caren Byrd, an executive director of the global utility and power group at Morgan Stanley in New York. “The warning lights now are flashing more brightly than just a year ago about the cost of new nuclear,” she said. And Jouni Silvennoinen, the project manager at Olkiluoto, said, “We have had it easy here.” Olkiluoto is at least a geologically stable site. Earthquake risks in places like China and the United States or even the threat of storm surges mean building these reactors will be even trickier elsewhere.",2009-05-29T04:05:28.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

It asserts that government interference in the disaster response created confusion and delays. The report, inches thick, was compiled by an in-house executive committee, overseen by a third-party panel of experts and presented to reporters after deep bows by a line of executives. The company stuck to a defense it has offered since the earliest days of the crisis: that no company could have predicted or prepared for last year’s magnitude 9.0 quake and subsequent tsunami. “The tsunami we experienced was just that big,” said the Tepco executive vice president Masao Yamazaki, who led the investigation. “The workers on the ground did their utmost under extreme conditions.” The claims appear to be an effort by the operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company, or Tepco, to reclaim some measure of its former standing by distancing itself from the layers of missteps in the nuclear disaster, which left more than 100,000 people displaced and areas uninhabitable possibly for decades. Over the last year, new details of the disaster have emerged that build a picture of an organization that ignored or concealed that its reactors might be vulnerable to quakes and tsunamis, used its close links with regulators and nuclear experts to hijack nuclear policy and — since the accident — has worked vigilantly to shut out close scrutiny of the ravaged plant’s condition. The report comes as the government is pushing to restore public confidence in nuclear energy and restart Japan’s reactor fleet . Critics were skeptical. “The report is too full of excuses,” said Masako Sawai of the Citizens’ Nuclear Information Center, an anti-nuclear policy group. “If we don’t get to the bottom of this accident, how can we prevent future ones?” she asked. Japan temporarily went nuclear-free in early May, as the last of its 54 reactors shut down for maintenance, and local opposition prevented others from coming back online. Last week, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda gave the go-ahead to restart two reactors in western Japan, a decision that has elicited relief from business leaders worried about a power crunch, but much furor from a still-jittery public. To quell public fears, Japan’s Parliament approved legislation on Wednesday to set up an independent regulator to oversee the nuclear industry. Previously, the industry had been policed by the same body tasked with promoting it. Still, the jitters were reinforced on Wednesday after an alarm went off at one of those two reactors warning of falling water levels in a cooling tank for its power generator. But later checks revealed no leaks and the restart is proceeding as planned, the reactor’s operator said. Tepco itself is pushing to reopen a large nuclear power plant on Japan’s northwestern shore. The company faces billions of dollars in compensation claims, as well as trillions of yen in costs of decommissioning the damaged reactors at Fukushima, a cost that has left its finances in ruins and prompted the government to effectively nationalize it. The report’s most fervent denials concern whether the company asked to abandon the plant at the height of the crisis — a move that experts say could have contaminated a far wider stretch of eastern Japan, possibly even Tokyo. The prime minister at the time of the disaster, Naoto Kan, has suggested in testimony to a public inquiry that he had received such a request from Tepco, a request he overrode. But Tepco claimed that Mr. Kan had misunderstood a request to evacuate just some of the less-essential workers. “It is an undeniable fact that our employees stayed — or even voluntarily returned to the plant — to bring it under control,” the report said. “Multiple reactors were in trouble, all power was lost, there were frequent aftershocks and tsunami warnings. But still, our employees stayed at their posts,” Mr. Yamazaki emphasized. And Tepco struck back at Mr. Kan, saying his meddling interfered in its disaster response. Mr. Kan flew to the plant in a helicopter the morning after the tsunami, and at times stepped in to give orders, causing “unnecessary confusion,” the report said.",2012-06-21T04:05:36.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Sometimes It's Fear For those who pay attention to such things, there is change afoot at the Indian Point nuclear plants. Correction: Make that the Indian Point Energy Center. In the process of taking over the plants, the Entergy Corporation has been replacing the ''nuclear'' part of the name with the more generic -- some might say more innocuous -- ''energy center.'' A sign with the new title went up last fall outside the main entrance of the plants, which are in Buchanan, about 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan. And in the past month, the name has surfaced in a series of newspaper and radio advertisements intended to reassure the public about the safety of Indian Point's nuclear operations. In one recent newspaper ad, for instance, readers were urged to ''Take confidence in the security of Indian Point Energy Center.'' Jim Steets, a spokesman for Entergy, said the name change reflected the company's plan to eventually add a gas turbine to the site, and to integrate what had been two separate nuclear plant operations under different owners. Entergy bought Indian Point 3 from the New York Power Authority in 2000, and Indian Point 2 from Consolidated Edison in September. ''It was an important message to our employees that we were one site, one team,'' he said. ''It was really about the integration of the sites rather than coming up with a name that was more palatable.'' But some critics say that Entergy is trying to downplay its nuclear operations in reaction to widespread concerns over safety since the Sept. 11 terror attacks. ''Corporations like to find ways to explain to people that castor oil is really honey,'' said State Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky. ''This is the kind of thing that General Electric tried to do with PCB's in the Hudson.'' Mr. Steets has denied any such motive, calling the criticisms ''naïve and overly suspicious.'' ''Indian Point only means one thing to anyone who's been involved or lived in Westchester,'' he said. ''It wasn't like we were trying to fool them into thinking we were a solar-generated plant.'' Indian Point is not the only nuclear plant seeking a makeover. The Millstone Nuclear Power Station in Waterford, Conn., recently shortened its name to Millstone Power Station, while Washington Nuclear Project 2 near Richland, Wash., was rechristened the Columbia Generating Station. Among the other plants without a ''nuclear'' in sight is the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station near Berwick, Pa. ''It's not unusual not to have nuclear in the name,'' said Diane Screnci, a spokeswoman for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission. But in the commission's records, at least, the official name of the Indian Point plants remains the Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit 2 and Unit 3. In the end, of course, a name change is just that. A nuclear plant by any other name is still a nuclear plant. Harry Di Pietro, 65, a storeowner in Buchanan who supports nuclear energy, said he would continue to call it just ''Indian Point.'' ''I know what it is, whatever they call it,'' he said. ''It doesn't really matter. What's in a name anyway?''",2002-03-23T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Assadollah Sabouri, the deputy chief of the Atomic Energy Organization, which is in charge of the power plant project, said at a news conference that the reactor would start seven months after the Russians hand over the keys, now expected to occur early in 2006. He said the reactor could then start by October 2006. The final cost will exceed $1 billion, he said. Iran had hoped at one point that the reactor would start operating by the end of 2003. ''We have contracts with Russia to build more nuclear reactors,'' Mr. Sabouri said. ''No number has been specified, but definitely our contract with Russia is to build more than one nuclear power plant.'' The United States has raised concerns about Iran's nuclear projects, contending that Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons. The country's ability to enrich uranium has raised concerns that it can produce nuclear bombs. Iran began building two nuclear reactors in Bushehr, with German help, before the revolution in 1979, but the work stopped because of the revolution and the war with Iraq. Instead, Russia undertook to finish one plant. Mr. Sabouri said two other European countries had expressed interest in the projects, but he declined to identify them. ''My message to Europeans is that we have to pass the paperwork stage and go for binding contracts as soon as possible,'' he said. Mr. Sabouri said that under the new timetable, Iran would need to receive nuclear fuel from Russia by the end of 2005, and that Iran had agreed to return the spent fuel to Russia. ''There is no ambiguity on returning the spent fuel,'' he said. ''What we have not agreed on with Russia is the expenses.'' Iran has said that it is planning to produce its own fuel, but Mr. Sabouri said Sunday that Iran is still ''many years away'' from making its own fuel. ''For the first stage, we have a contract with the Russians for the supply of fuel for 10 years,'' he said. ''We are counting on the fact that we can use the fuel produced by Iran for the second phase.'' John R. Bolton, the American under secretary of state for arms control, said Thursday that Iran had informed British, French and German officials that it could produce weapons-grade uranium within a year and a nuclear weapon no more than three years after that, The Associated Press reported. ''These Iranian assertions give the lie to their contention that their nuclear program is entirely civil and peaceful in purpose,'' he was quoted as saying. Iran reached an agreement in October with three European countries to sign an additional protocol to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty allowing more intrusive inspections of its nuclear sites. It also agreed to suspend enriching uranium to earn international confidence. Iran, however, rejects the accusations that it plans to produce nuclear weapons and contends that nuclear plants are needed to help increase its electricity supply.",2004-08-23T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,washington

The Federal Government's decision to abandon its current development of the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Depository in Nevada, and to start again on a new plan for the same site, repeats an old, discouraging story: a ballyhooed ''solution'' to the radioactive waste problem that turns out to be just one more flop. After 30 years of failure, this latest fiasco - two years of effort and $500 million down the drain - involves more than another American technological failure. It suggests again that the disposal of dangerous nuclear waste is a political question almost as difficult to solve as the technological problem. Because the redesigned Yucca Flats depository cannot be opened before the year 2010, even if both technological and political difficulties are overcome, the use of nuclear reactors to generate electricity will be even more constrained in the United States. Already, California law sensibly prevents new reactor construction before a solution to the waste problem is demonstrated. Because the further generation of electricity by nuclear means has been set back for decades and perhaps for much longer, economic growth and expanding population will bring increasing pressures for the use of fossil fuels. But excessive burning of coal, oil and wood already causes heavy environmental damage to the planet. Thus the Yucca Flats failure puts higher priority on energy conservation and renewable energy sources. To what extent industry and the general population can be educated or might be lured or should be forced into adopting those alternatives are questions yet to be answered. As pointed out by Matthew Wald in The New York Times, moreover, the question now has to be asked whether a solution will ever be found to the safe disposal of vast quantities of wastes that will remain dangerous to all life for literally thousands of years. Mr. Wald raised the question in a scientific context. The U.S. already has tried and failed to find the answer in salt caves in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi; engineers have talked fruitlessly of firing the wastes into space or into the sun, or of burying them under the polar ice caps; ''reprocessing'' the stuff to make it less hazardous is costly, could facilitate the proliferation of nuclear weapons and still leaves the problem of safely storing the reprocessed wastes for thousands of years; above-ground storage in special casks offers a solution only into the next century. But the question also has to be asked politically. Popular resistance in the states affected was not the least reason salt-cave storage had to be abandoned; it was perhaps the primary reason granite repositories in New Hampshire, Michigan and Maine were ruled out; and even the desert storage at Yucca Flats that once was considered so promising produced tenacious opposition in Nevada. In the last case, the Government's faulty plans no doubt increased local resistance. But such resistance inevitably will arise wherever a repository is planned, and no wonder. Just ask yourself if you want highly radioactive material, that will remain so virtually forever, stored in your vicinity; and even if you are willing, ask yourself if, after 30 years of failure, inept management and deception (remember when nuclear power was going to be ''too cheap to meter''?), you could believe the assurances of either government or industry that the problem finally has been solved. No doubt dedicated opponents of nuclear power - they are numerous, on both environmental and safety grounds - will consider the Yucca Flats decision one more reason why nuclear power should be abandoned altogether. I am among those not yet convinced either that a safe nuclear-power program cannot be developed or that such a program can be made superfluous by conservation and alternative energy sources. But even if nuclear power production were to be entirely halted and the existing plants scrapped - even if nuclear weapons production were halted for good measure - the baffling problem of waste disposal would remain; in the short run it actually would be exacerbated by the greatly increased amounts of waste to be stored. Either way, therefore, whether nuclear power is abandoned or continued, much less extended, the lethal waste disposal problem, both technological and political, will remain -humbling evidence of the arrogance of a course confidently embarked upon before anyone knew where it would lead.

Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters Ukraine accused Russian forces on Sunday of firing rockets that landed on the grounds of a nuclear power plant that Russia has seized in the south of the country, further raising the risk of an accident at a complex where the United Nations’ nuclear agency has said that the principles of nuclear safety have been violated. A pro-Russian regional official blamed Ukrainian forces for the attack. The rockets fired Saturday evening landed near a dry spent fuel storage facility, where 174 casks are stored, each containing 24 assemblies of spent nuclear fuel, according to Enerhoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear energy company. One person was wounded by shrapnel and many windows were damaged. “Apparently, they aimed specifically at the casks with spent fuel, which are stored in the open near the site of shelling,” the company said in a post on the Telegram social messaging app. Three radiation detection monitors were damaged so “timely detection and response in case of aggravation of the radiation situation or leakage of radiation from spent nuclear fuel casks are currently impossible,” the post said, adding that a catastrophe was “miraculously avoided.” Russian forces have controlled the Zaporizhzhia plant since March. A representative of Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate, Andrei Yusov, said that Russia was shelling the site to destroy infrastructure and damage power lines that supply electricity to Ukraine’s national grid and, ultimately, to cause a power blackout in the south of the country. There was no independent confirmation of the assertion. The head of the pro-Russian administration in Zaporizhzhia, Yevgeny Balitsky, said on Telegram on Sunday that Ukrainian forces had used an Uragan cluster rocket to target the spent fuel storage area and damage administrative buildings. On Thursday, Russia’s defense ministry said that Ukraine had launched an artillery strike against the plant. During a national television phone-in show on Sunday, the head of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, Oleksandr Starukh, said that there was only a three-second delay between the firing and the landing of each shell, using this as evidence that the attack had come from Russian forces nearby. Since invading Ukraine in February, Russia has made it a priority to seize critical infrastructure including power plants, ports, transportation, and agricultural storage and production facilities. It has also targeted infrastructure in Ukrainian hands. In an earlier post, Enerhoatom said that Russian shellfire had damaged a nitrogen-oxygen unit and the combined auxiliary building. “There are still risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances, and the fire hazard is also high,” the post said. Mr. Yusov also said on Telegram that Russian forces had laid mines at the plant’s power units. Concern about safety at Zaporizhzhia has been mounting since March, when a fire broke out in a building during fighting as Russian forces took control. The Ukrainian authorities say that Russian forces have since stored weapons, including artillery, at the plant, and that in recent weeks they began shelling Nikopol, a nearby city held by Ukraine, from positions on its grounds. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in a speech late on Saturday that there had been a “significant worsening of the situation around the plant,” and added that Russia had become the first country in the world “to use a nuclear plant for terror.” On Sunday, he spoke with the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and said in a tweet that he had called for a stronger international response against Russia’s “nuclear terror.” The prospect of a Ukrainian counteroffensive to reclaim land in Kherson Province, which is southwest of Zaporizhzhia, also heightens instability. Ukraine was the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident when, in 1986, a reactor fire broke out at the Chernobyl complex in the country’s north.

But the politician he was with when he made the announcement, Gov. Eisaku Sato of the Fukushima prefecture, the site of many nuclear plants, left no doubt that the public's newly raised suspicions about nuclear power were precisely what the postponement was all about. This was no time for an expansion of the nuclear program, Mr. Sato said, citing Japan's worst nuclear accident, in September, which killed one worker and exposed scores of people to radiation. ''Now is the time for mourning,'' Mr. Sato said. The brief meeting between the industry chief and the governor illustrated how sharply the ground has begun to shift under Japan's electric utilities since workers set off the accidental chain reaction at Tokaimura, 70 miles north of Tokyo. The accident forced a partial evacuation of the town and set off a death watch for the irradiated workers. And, more than any event in a history full of serious mishaps, it rattled the ironclad coalition between industry and government that has long made Japan, a country with precious few domestic sources of energy, the world's most ambitious user of nuclear energy, providing one-third of its supplies. Strikingly, in a country known for its political quiescence, the sharp movement of public opinion against nuclear power has taken the form of a genuine groundswell, from subway straphangers horrified by stories about safety lapses and small civic groups that have started petition drives against the industry's expansion to local political candidates who are running for office on the issue. Public protest has not been common in Japanese society for well over a generation, having mostly died out since Japan attained the level of affluence of many Western countries, starting in the 1960's. But in recent years -- timidly at first, and then with growing speed -- localized movements have been springing up and asserting themselves more boldly, notably in the courts, to protect consumer interests or the environment. Since the Tokaimura accident, small citizens' groups, encouraged by the spreading awareness of the risks of nuclear energy, have sued regional power companies to prevent the introduction of the new plutonium fuel and petitioned local governments to block plant construction. A scandal involving the falsification of inspection data by the British maker of plutonium pellets has also strengthened resistance. The grassroots activists have put the nuclear industry on the defensive in ways that recall its decline in the United States and much of Europe after the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. In the clearest example of the impact of local mobilization, Mayor Takaaki Sasaguchi of Maki, in the Nigata prefecture, used his announcement of his re-election campaign today to declare his opposition to plans to build a new plant in his city. The industry, citing unflinching support from the national government and Japan's near total dependence on imported fuels, has pledged to stick to its plans for plutonium, which it describes as a step toward developing so-called fast-breeder technology. With fast-breeder reactors, whose development remains, perhaps, decades away, proponents say Japan will be able to produce more plutonium fuel than it consumes and achieve the holy grail of energy independence. In the meantime, industry officials say they merely need to be patient until public passions against nuclear energy die down, and they will proceed with plans to build many plutonium-burning plants. ''There is only enough uranium in the world to last 72 years, and our country is not endowed with fossil fuels,'' the chairman of the Federation of Electric Power Companies, Hiroji Ota, said. ''There are some other alternative power sources like solar and wind energy. But they all present technical problems. For all these reasons, MOX fuel is appropriate for Japan.'' MOX, or mixed oxide, fuel is the new plutonium-based fuel that the largest utilities had planned to start using late last year. In western Takahama, a former fishing village that is home to four nuclear power plants, the surprising face of the antinuclear activism is a citizens' group largely made up of homemakers and elderly people. Judging from the group's determination, the utilities may be underestimating the opposition. In October, the group started a drive that collected 2,170 signatures in a town of fewer than 9,000 inhabitants. The focus of the drive, like that of much of the recent opposition to nuclear power in Japan, is the new plutonium-based fuel. On a recent morning, the group delivered a letter to Mayor Riichi Imai, exquisitely polite in their protocol in a typically Japanese manner but absolutely firm in their message -- the town must refuse the new fuel. Lighting a cigarette, Mr. Imai refused to commit himself, saying he would explain his position soon before the regional assembly. That provoked a bitter laugh from Masae Sawayama, 90, the group's doyenne. ''It occurred to me that our mayor might do like most politicians do and go tell a bunch of lies later,'' Ms. Sawayama said. The uphill struggle of the group becomes clear on entering City Hall, where large interactive displays show idyllic color images of the town's plants nestled in the hills by a rocky bay. Even public parks there are decorated with statues and monuments that commemorate mastery of the atom. Fishing has almost disappeared as a way of life. Nowadays, whether directly or indirectly, the regional utility, the Kansai Electric Power Company, employs the bulk of the population. The electric company has spared no effort to keep the townspeople on its side, subsidizing regular bus tours to its headquarters in Osaka, more than two hours away, for safety briefings. And residents say the cable television company runs annoyingly frequent public-service-style announcements on the benefits of nuclear power. Despite all that, the Tokaimura nuclear-fuel processing accident seems to have awakened the deep Japanese allergy to things nuclear, born after the United States dropped two atomic bombs on the country in 1945. And many have put their foot down and said no to the new program, seizing on studies by scientists in France, which uses MOX fuel in a limited way, and in the United States, which does not, that have shown that the fuels are more unstable during burning than the plain uranium fuels that they are intended to replace. In the end, Mayor Imai, who has been a strong supporter of nuclear power throughout his career, had no choice but to oppose the new fuel, at least for now. The shock from the British falsification scandal, coming on top of the Tokaimura accident, simply made it politically impossible to give his approval. Announcing his turnabout, Mr. Imai spoke bitterly, saying he felt betrayed by the industry experts who had campaigned for his approval of MOX. [On Jan. 12, the Kansai said that it would return a shipload of recycled plutonium fuel to British Nuclear Fuels, the company where inspection figures had been altered, Agence France-Presse reported.]",2000-01-13T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,front-page

Cahill Jr., a well-known figure in the nuclear industry, to take charge of its troubled nuclear operations, authority officials said yesterday. The authority's Indian Point 3 nuclear plant in Buchanan, N.Y., has been shut for 14 months, mostly because of management problems. Mr. Cahill, 70, was hired by S. David Freeman, who became president and chief executive of the authority last month. Mr. Cahill is currently group vice president for TU Electric in Dallas, the subsidiary of the Texas Utilities Company that operates the two Comanche Peak reactors in Somervell County, Tex. In the early 1970's, as an engineer at the Consolidated Edison Company, he helped build Indian Point 2 and 3, and helped transfer Unit 3's license to the Power Authority when that reactor was sold, shortly before it began commercial operation. Mr. Freeman said he believed that Mr. Cahill, who will be executive vice president of the authority, will ""instill some confidence"" about the plant with regulators and others. ""We've picked one of the most accomplished nuclear experts in the country,"" Mr. Freeman said. Ralph Beedle, who had held the job, resigned on Feb. 1 after an extended medical leave. Another top official of the authority, John C. Brons, a nuclear specialist, was dismissed as president of the authority in June 1993.

Masataka Shimizu, the company’s president, said individuals would receive about $9,000 and larger households would receive about $12,000. Only people who live within a radius of 19 miles of the damaged power plant, who were initially evacuated, will be eligible for the payments. The government on Monday ordered the evacuation in the coming month of people in five additional communities that lie farther from the stricken power plant but received higher levels of radiation than elsewhere because of wind and rain patterns. Once residents of these communities have been certified by the government as also qualifying as victims of a nuclear disaster, the company will make the same payments to them, Mr. Shimizu said. Tokyo Electric Power Company officials had no immediate data on how many people might qualify from these communities. The government said the company acted after a request from Banri Kaieda, the minister of economy, trade and industry. The utility’s full liability for the nuclear accident has not been established and will depend heavily on whether the government characterizes the earthquake and tsunami on March 11 as an exceptional event that could not have been readily anticipated. No decision has been made on possible compensation to farmers and fishermen who may have lost their livelihoods at least temporarily because of the nuclear accident. Repair efforts continued slowly at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. An announcement late Thursday of sharply rising temperatures at the base of Reactor No. 3 had provoked brief concern, but regulators said Friday morning that the readings appeared to have come from a malfunctioning thermometer. In another development, the International Atomic Energy Agency said that Japan had reported that 28 of the approximately 300 workers trying to stabilize the nuclear plant had received high radiation doses . The 28 workers have accumulated doses of more than 100 millisieverts, the agency said, though none have received a dose of more than 250 millisieverts. Japan’s Health Ministry said on March 15 that it was raising the legal limit on the amount of radiation to which each worker could be exposed to 250 millisieverts from 100 millisieverts. That is five times the maximum exposure permitted for American nuclear plant workers. In a sign of a return to normality on Friday, Tokyo Disneyland reopened with limited hours, after closing a month ago to conduct repairs and conserve electricity. Throngs of people showed up outside the amusement park’s gates before opening time, vying to be among the first to return. The United States government, saying the situation at Fukushima Daiichi has become less perilous, lifted its travel warning for Tokyo and said it would allow dependents of government employees to return to Japan. The travel alert issued by the State Department on Thursday said that although the situation at the nuclear plant “remains serious and dynamic,” the health risks in areas outside the 50-mile evacuation zone recommended by the American government “are low and do not pose significant risks to U.S. citizens.” It said that even in the event of an unexpected disruption at the plant, harmful exposures to people beyond 50 miles were “highly unlikely.” The State Department said the new policy was based on the assessment of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Energy Department and the unanimous opinion of American scientific experts in Japan. It came three days before Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was scheduled to visit Japan in what is described as a show of support for the Japanese people. The State Department had authorized the voluntary departure of dependents of government employees in Tokyo and some other areas on March 16 and had advised American citizens to defer nonessential travel to the Tokyo area and to northeastern Japan, where the nuclear plant is located. In its new alert, the State Department said the situation at the plant “is dramatically different today than it was on March 16, when we saw significant ongoing releases of radioactivity, the loss of effective means to cool the reactor cores and spent fuel, the absence of outside power or fresh water supply for emergency management, and considerable uncertainty about the condition of the site.” Now, it said, the efforts to cool the reactors and spent fuel were “ongoing and successful,” power and water were partly or fully restored and planning had begun to control radioactive contamination and mitigate future dangers.",2011-04-15T09:33:55.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

But atomic officials estimate that as many as 40 more countries have the technical skill, and in some cases the required material, to build a bomb. That ability, coupled with new nuclear threats in Asia and the Middle East, risks a second nuclear age, officials and arms control specialists say, in which nations are more likely to abandon the old restraints against atomic weapons. The spread of nuclear technology is expected to accelerate as nations redouble their reliance on atomic power. That will give more countries the ability to make reactor fuel, or, with the same equipment and a little more effort, bomb fuel -- the hardest part of the arms equation. Signs of activity abound. Hundreds of companies are now prospecting for uranium where dozens did a few years ago. Argentina, Australia and South Africa are drawing up plans to begin enriching uranium, and other countries are considering doing the same. Egypt is reviving its program to develop nuclear power. Concern about the situation led the International Atomic Energy Agency to summon hundreds of government officials and experts from around the world to Vienna in September to discuss tightening restrictions on who is permitted to produce nuclear fuel. ''These dangers are urgent,'' Sam Nunn, an expert on nuclear proliferation and a former Democratic senator, told the group. ''We are in a race between cooperation and catastrophe and, at this moment, the outcome is unclear.'' But even the atomic agency itself exemplifies some of the underlying tensions inherent in the development of nuclear energy. For decades, the I.A.E.A., known as the world's nuclear policeman, has pursued its other mandate -- to promote safe nuclear power -- by running technical aid programs with roughly a hundred states. Some of that knowledge could be useful in a weapons program, though the aid is meant exclusively for civilian use. The agency still helps Pakistan, which exploded a nuclear bomb in 1998. It also helped North Korea until a decade ago. Even today, it is assisting Iran, which many experts fear is close to mastering the basics of making a bomb. It has 14 programs under way with Iran, including a study on upgrading a nuclear research laboratory, as well as helping it start up its Bushehr reactor. North Korea's reported test has shaken the nuclear status quo and raised anew the question of whether Asia will be the first to feel a nuclear ''domino effect,'' in which states clandestinely hedge their bets by assembling the crucial technologies needed to make a bomb, or actually cross the line to become new weapons states. In the Middle East, the confrontation with Iran has focused new attention on countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, both of which fear that an Iranian bomb would make Tehran the greatest power in the region. Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the I.A.E.A., has estimated that up to 49 nations now know how to make nuclear arms, and he has warned that global tensions could push some over the line. ''We are relying,'' he said, ''primarily on the continued good intentions of these countries -- intentions which are in turn based on their sense of security or insecurity, and could therefore be subject to rapid change.'' Worry about proliferation is hardly new. In March 1963, President John F. Kennedy said, ''I am haunted by the feeling that by 1970, unless we are successful, there may be 10 nuclear powers instead of 4, and by 1975, 15 or 20.'' That timetable proved to be inaccurate. But in recent years there has been a sense around the globe that President Kennedy's prediction is about to come true, three decades late. Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, said this year that ''the international community seems almost to be sleepwalking'' down a path where states, after long living without nuclear arms, now feel compelled to revisit their logic. He warned of a new arms race -- not one of superpowers, but of regional powers. ''Perhaps most damaging of all,'' he concluded, ''there is also a perception that the possession of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction offers the best protection against being attacked.'' A New Nuclear Vision Democrats and Republicans spent the past week arguing over who lost control of North Korea, Bill Clinton or George W. Bush. But seeds of the problem were planted by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, just months after the armistice ended the fighting on the Korean Peninsula in 1953. ''It is not enough to take this weapon out of the hands of soldiers,'' President Eisenhower told the United Nations that year, just as his administration was completing a series of 11 nuclear tests. ''It must be put in the hands of those who will know how to strip its military casing and adapt it to the arts of peace.'' His program was called Atoms for Peace, and soon involved dozens of nations, all seeking to unlock the magic of nuclear power. The first generation of nuclear reactors sprang up around the globe, as did a huge supporting industry and an international overseer, the I.A.E.A. But almost from the start, evidence accumulated that countries were using the civil alliances and reactor technologies to make bombs. By 1960, France had joined the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union as a nuclear weapons state. China conducted its first test in 1964. Israel had the bomb by 1967, India by 1974, South Africa by 1982 (it has since given up its weapons) and Pakistan by 1998. All but the original three built their weapons by exploiting at least some technologies that were ostensibly civilian, nuclear analysts say. They enriched uranium beyond the low level needed for power reactors. Or they mined the spent fuel of civil reactors for plutonium -- the path that North Korea started taking in the late 1980's or early 1990's, according to American intelligence officials. The international atomic agency, which still inscribes Atoms for Peace on its business cards, has worked hard to fight this kind of cheating while also helping with the basic technology. In the 1980's, it aided Iran's hunt for uranium. Even today, Iranian technicians fly to Vienna and agency experts go to Iran to lend a hand. In August, two experts went to review progress at the Bushehr reactor, which is scheduled to go critical next year. ''It's helping establish that the plant is run in a safe and secure manner, which is in everybody's interest,'' said M. Peter Salema, an agency official. ''Look at Chernobyl. That's the whole point.'' Many of the agency's cooperative projects use nuclear science to humanitarian ends, like fighting disease and treating cancer. But others involve more basic atomic skills. ''We provide expert services,'' Dr. Salema said, ''so they can learn to do things for themselves.'' The Technology Boom The Manhattan project scientists who built the first atom bomb predicted that the diffusion of their secret knowledge was inevitable. It was just a question of time. Now, after decades of scholarly digging, government declassification, open research in uranium and plutonium metallurgy and the rise of the Internet, much of that information is freely available. ''The general concepts are widely known,'' said Robert S. Norris, the author of ''Racing for the Bomb.'' ''Still, it's another thing to actually do it. That still requires certain skills of engineering and chemistry and physics.'' The hardest part, experts agree, is not acquiring the weapons blueprints but obtaining the fuel. That is becoming easier because of developments both overt and covert. Abdul Qadeer Khan, a chief architect of Pakistan's nuclear arms program who went on to establish the world's largest atomic black market, sold the secrets of how to make centrifuges for enriching uranium to Libya, Iran and North Korea. Tehran insists its intentions are entirely peaceful, though most analysts judge that all three countries bought from the black market because they wanted to make nuclear arms. Dr. Khan sold plans and parts for Pakistan's first-generation centrifuge, the P-1, as well as the next generation, the P-2, which can spin faster to enrich uranium more rapidly. Investigators are still trying to learn where else Dr. Khan may have planted his nuclear seeds. They discovered outposts of his network in Dubai, Malaysia and South Africa and found that before his downfall in 2004 he visited at least 18 countries, including Egypt, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan, Syria and Saudi Arabia. The worrisome enrichment trends involve not just stealthy military advances but also soaring demands for nuclear power, driven by rising populations, dwindling oil supplies and fears that the combustion of fossil fuels is warming the planet. ''The nuclear renaissance is gaining momentum,'' said George B. Assie, vice president for business development at Cameco, the world's largest publicly traded uranium company, based in Canada. In London, the World Nuclear Association says 28 new reactors are under construction, 62 planned, and 160 proposed, most in Asia. The required uranium, it estimates, could run to more than 65,000 tons. While it is not clear if the expansion of the world's civilian atomic infrastructure will ultimately lead to a rise in the number of countries building nuclear arms, it could give more countries the means to do so. There are two main ways to turn civilian technology to military use. The first is to enrich uranium fuel from its usual level of 5 percent for reactors to the 90 percent needed for a bomb, a modest step that requires longer processing in centrifuges. The second is to take spent reactor fuel and mine it for plutonium, the other main fuel for a bomb. The Brazilian military, for example, worked hard for decades to develop centrifuges to enrich uranium fuel for a bomb, a secret program it renounced in the 1990's. In May, Brazil, despite growing pressure to give up indigenous production, inaugurated its first uranium enrichment plant -- an assembly of advanced centrifuges in Resende, in the state of Rio de Janeiro. While Iran has aroused global suspicions for erecting a similar plant, Brazil managed to reassure other nations, and the international atomic agency, that its aims are peaceful. ''We have an urgent need to expand the electric system,'' said Leonam dos Santos Guimarães, an official of Electronuclear, which operates nuclear power plants in Brazil. Forecasting the size of the revitalized global industry is difficult. Even so, the predictions can be staggering. Hans-Holger Rogner, an economist at the international atomic agency, said that many forecasts for the 21st century foresaw huge expansions beyond the 443 power reactors now operating globally. ''An increase to 5,000 reactors is well within the range of many of the longer-range studies,'' Dr. Rogner said, adding: ''People are positioning themselves. There seems to be a race coming and nobody wants to be left out.'' A Complex Game A day after North Korea's nuclear test, Japan's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, vowed not to abandon Japan's commitment to reject and never possess nuclear weapons, a cornerstone of Japanese foreign policy since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But, even so, Japan already has all the component parts. It has many tons of plutonium left over from the operation of its reactors, according to a 2004 government report to the I.A.E.A. A small nuclear warhead requires only 10 pounds. Japan is the ultimate example of a ''nuclear option'' state, a country that the world knows could become an atomic power virtually overnight, if need be. ''They could be very far down the road toward a virtual deterrent and not be in violation of any of the existing international treaties,'' said Robert L. Gallucci, the former chief American negotiator with North Korea, and now dean of Georgetown University's school of foreign service. South Korea has also vowed not to pursue nuclear weapons. But it has an extensive network of nuclear power reactors and a few years ago, I.A.E.A. inspectors found evidence of undeclared experimentation to make highly enriched uranium. In the early 1990's, South Korea signed an agreement to keep the Korean Peninsula nuclear-free -- but it signed the accord with North Korea. Iran's nuclear rise has prompted concerns that the Middle East could experience similar pressures. In the region, only Israel is believed to possess nuclear arms, although it has never confirmed that. If Iran -- a Shiite state -- does indeed build nuclear weapons, there are fears that Sunni powers like Saudi Arabia or Egypt will be tempted to make their own bombs. Egypt, which long ago sought to build nuclear arms, may be starting to rethink its earlier renunciation. The 1998 nuclear tests by India and Pakistan shook Cairo. ''Egypt's leaders had placed their bet clearly in favor of the Middle East and the world moving away from nuclear weapons,'' said Robert J. Einhorn, a former senior State Department nonproliferation official. ''But here was a disquieting indication that movement might be in the opposite direction.'' Recently, the international atomic agency found that Egypt had kept some of its old and new efforts cloaked in secrecy, including a continuing project to acquire uranium ore in the Sinai desert. In September, Cairo announced plans to revive its stalled program to build reactors for generating nuclear power. It gave no sign of whether it, like Iran, planned to make reactor fuel on its own. So the question now is whether North Korea's test, and Iran's challenge, will change the calculus. ''When additional countries get the bomb, it does create new pressures,'' said Matthew Bunn of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, who tracks the spread of nuclear technology. ''But each country is unique and there's little risk that the dominoes will fall quickly, especially if we take steps to prevent it.'' New Ground Rules When atomic specialists gathered in Vienna in September to discuss new ground rules for a second nuclear age, their proceedings were fueled by the fear that some of the old restraints -- both technological and political -- are fraying. The central proposal debated at the I.A.E.A.'s headquarters sounded simple: No longer should nations be permitted to develop their own means of enriching uranium to make reactor fuel, which Iran and other developing states have claimed as their inalienable right under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Nearly 40 years after the treaty was drafted, the dangers simply seem too great. Instead, the argument went, nations should band together to make multinational fuel banks where they could watch one another, making sure no fuel is diverted for bomb production. ''A threat exists,'' said Sergei Kirienko, director of the Russian Federal Atomic Energy Agency. ''We understand that only those solutions that are resolved together, that ensure access for all nations today, will be successful.'' Russia took the lead, proposing an international fuel bank that it would set up on its own soil by next year -- and from which it could potentially extract billions of dollars in sales. But the big splash came when Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire philanthropist, pledged $50 million for a fuel bank to be run by the I.A.E.A., making the United Nations body a ''supplier of last resort'' for any country that forsakes making its own fuel. The Bush administration has backed similar plans. But while there is agreement on the problem, solutions bogged down in bickering -- from weapons states that want to maintain their capacity and from developing nations that sniff a conspiracy to deny them the same nuclear rights that large powers have long enjoyed. ''We should guard against the notion that sensitive technologies are safe in the hands of some, but pose a risk when others have access to them,'' said Buyelwa Sonjica, the energy minister of South Africa, which wants to restart its enrichment program and build up to six reactors. Few parties involved in the debate are optimistic about reform, and some say the enterprise is doomed to failure. ''Nuclear power is inextricably linked with nuclear proliferation,'' the environmental group Greenpeace said in a recent statement. ''None of the schemes being promoted will solve this problem. In fact, they will make it worse.'' So far, though, the countries that the world most wants to stop from enriching say they have seen no reason to do so. At a dinner in New York in September, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran looked supremely confident as he batted away the idea that other countries could be relied upon to provide him with the nuclear fuel he said he needed. ''Before stopping enrichment by others, why don't you stop building the next generation of nuclear weapons?'' he asked his American hosts. Then, smiling, he suggested that the United States just buy its nuclear fuel from Iran's new facilities. He would sell it to Washington, he said, ''with a 50 percent discount.''",2006-10-15T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk

To the Editor: To the Editor: From a strictly scientific viewpoint, there is a certain element of unreality to the public furor roused by commercial-nuclear-waste disposal. A certain amount of public concern is understandable, but the degree of attention surrounding the issue hardly seems warranted in light of the virtually unanimous consensus of thousands of exhaustive studies produced by national and international scientific organizations over the years. For example, according to a recent report by the International Council of Scientific Unions, ''nuclear wastes may be safely disposed of using current technology.'' Who are these guys? According to their report, a body that ''is responsible to no government, has no vested interest in nuclear power (or any other kind of power), has access to the world's scientific and technical community and can come to conclusions purely on scientific grounds.'' Our own highly esteemed Congressional Office of Technology Assessment said of mined geological nuclear repositories in a 1982 report: ''There appears to be no insurmountable technical obstacles to developing such repositories to meet tentative Environmental Protection Agency safety criteria at a cost no more than a few percent of the total cost of nuclear power.'' How are such conclusions possible? Consider, for perspective, that a strict comparison of the normal, albeit very low, radioactive emissions from coal combustion reveals a radiation risk thousand of times greater than the maximum theoretical radiation releases from the worst accident during the operation of a nuclear-waste repository. As for radiation risks associated with leaks from a completed nuclear-waste site, they are calculated to be at least 30,000 times lower than the normal risks from natural background radiation. And if all else fails, look to mother nature. About two billion years ago, when the isotopic composition of uranium deposits was similar to that found in United States reactors today, mother nature operated several natural reactors in an area that is now Gabon, Africa. Basically, when water was present to provide the catalyst for a nuclear reaction, the deposits went critical and generated ''nuclear power.'' When the water evaporated, the reactors shut down. These reactors operated off and on for a few hundred thousand years. O.K., where's the waste? The short-lived gases diffused into the atmosphere. But the plutonium, americium and other ''bad actors'' migrated 30 feet or less in the soil (plain old dirt) in about two billion years! Man, with the ability to select a better geological medium and provide additional technological barriers to stabilize the waste, ought to be able to beat mother nature's record without difficulty. Such facts illustrate a fundamental problem, and one that the Office of Technology Assessment and many others have pointed to: better efforts on the part of experts to educate the public about what is known. The real issues seem to be political in nature and not associated with technological reality. JOHN W.

Wrestles With Role of Nuclear Plants in Carbon Emission Rules,"WASHINGTON — Trying to write a complicated formula to cut carbon emissions, the Environmental Protection Agency thinks it has found a magic number: 5.8. The agency is trying to complete a rule governing carbon emissions from power plants, and among the most complicated and contentious issues is how to treat existing nuclear power plants. Many of them are threatened with shutdowns because cheap natural gas has made their reactors uncompetitive. The agency’s proposal gave an odd mathematical formula for evaluating nuclear plants’ contribution to carbon emissions. It said that 5.8 percent of existing nuclear capacity was at risk of being shut for financial reasons, and thus for states with nuclear reactors, keeping them running would earn a credit of 5.8 percent toward that state’s carbon reduction goal. Since receiving tens of thousands of comments on the proposal, the agency is now reviewing the plan. It must evaluate all comments before it sets a final rule, which it hopes to do by June. That rule, however, is likely to be challenged in court. Under the proposed formula, if a state closed a 1,000-megawatt nuclear plant and replaced 5.8 percent of it, or 58 megawatts, with carbon-free electricity, it would be deemed to be “carbon neutral.” The state would reach the benchmark even if the other 942 megawatts of power generated came from a carbon-emitting source like natural gas combustion. Conversely, a state that kept all its nuclear plants open until 2030 could claim a credit for 5.8 percent toward its carbon reduction goal. The 5.8 percent figure for nuclear power plants puzzled even opponents of such power sources. “It’s a pretty arbitrary number, I’ll grant them that,” said Michael Mariotte, the president of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, an activist group that is adamantly opposed to anything nuclear. “Replacing 5.8 percent of any power plant is sort of an odd concept,” he said. Mr. Mariotte, though, said that some reactors could be retired without driving up carbon emissions. “We’re not convinced that a lot of it needs to be replaced; some of it’s just excess power,” he said. The proposal prompted the American Nuclear Society to coordinate a letter-writing campaign to persuade the E.P.A. to help the reactors. States should get credit for any actions they take to hold down carbon emissions, said Craig H. Piercy, the Washington representative of the group. “A pound of carbon reduced anywhere ought to be treated the same,” he said. Still, he said, in the draft rule, the nuclear industry fared better than hydroelectricity, the second-biggest source of carbon-free electricity, which got zero credit. Mr. Mariotte of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service and other nuclear opponents appear to be mostly concerned that the reactors, which they regard as unsafe, could get a new lease on life. His group and others sent a letter to the E.P.A. complaining about a related issue: that the draft carbon rule requires that states with reactors under construction continue building them, or face even harder-to-meet carbon targets. In fact, the question of where to draw the baseline — that is, the date from which the calculations start — is common to many aspects of the carbon rule. Senator Bob Casey Jr., a Pennsylvania Democrat, made a similar point in a letter to the E.P.A., saying that the rule should take into account previous work to promote clean energy sources, and to maintain existing nuclear plants. And at Exelon , a Chicago-based company that is considering whether to retire several reactors in the Midwest, Kathleen L. Barron, senior vice president for regulatory affairs, complained at a Washington conference on electricity and carbon, “We’re essentially taken for granted.” Assumed in the E.P.A.’s planning is that the five reactors currently under construction in the United States will go online. A twin-reactor Vogtle plant is planned near Augusta, Ga., and another twin-reactor plant is in development in South Carolina. In Tennessee, a reactor that the Tennessee Valley Authority started 40 years ago is almost complete. They are each multibillion-dollar projects, and certain to raise electricity prices, but because work began before the rule was proposed, the carbon-cutting goals set by the E.P.A. for those states do not include the reactors. A recent blog post at the Brookings Institution , by Philip A. Wallach and Alex Abdun-Nabi, points out that if ground had been broken later on the Vogtle plant, the reactors could have met Georgia’s reduction quota. “If, for some reason, the construction were to end unsuccessfully, Georgia would be in dire straits trying to fulfill the standard E.P.A. has set for it under the assumption of completion.” Energy experts inside and outside the nuclear industry said that cutting carbon emissions was worth money, and paying slightly above-market prices to keep a 40-year-old reactor running for 20 more years might cost less, per ton of carbon emission prevented, than building wind or solar plants, or coal plants that capture their carbon dioxide. “If you have an actual plant that’s subject to premature retirement, some of the work I’ve done with others says that to keep it running is a very cost-effective way to reduce carbon emissions,” said Mark Chupka, an electricity analyst at the Brattle Group, a consulting firm. And he added, “When a nuclear plant retires, you don’t retire 5.8 percent of the plant.” Of using a 5.8 percent figure, he said, “Everybody thinks it’s pretty odd, I think including the E.P.A.” Jon B. Wellinghoff , a former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said in an interview that maintaining the old plants would hold down carbon emissions, and that “if we want to keep them, we’ll probably have to support them.” Federal subsidies for wind energy , he said, are “knocking reactors off the system” by driving down energy costs, he said. Some traditional environmental groups, though, are reluctant to embrace more credit for existing plants. Daniel A. Lashof, the chief operating officer at NextGen Climate, the environmental advocacy group started by the climate advocate Tom Steyer, argued that the bigger issue was not what should keep running, but what should be built. “The problem is a lot of the complaints that existing nuclear plants aren’t getting enough credit from E.P.A.’s proposal basically amount to a request to weaken the rule,” said Mr. Lashof, also a longtime climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council , “so it’s nothing more than business as usual.”",2014-12-26T03:40:26.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

If it proceeds with plans to build 44 nuclear plants over the next decade, India needs to add 10,000 to 19,000 skilled people to the nuclear industry, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. That is about 1,000 to 1,900 people a year. But India’s top universities are graduating only about 50 nuclear specialists a year. Meanwhile, special graduate programs approved by the Department of Atomic Energy to address the shortage will add only about 100 master’s-level graduates this year. “There is a significant gap” between the manpower India’s nuclear industry needs and the work force it is getting, said Kameswara Rao, the executive director of energy, utilities and mining at PricewaterhouseCoopers in India. “If this program is going to take off,” he said, “you need to have engineers trained in the basics.” Worldwide, personnel shortages in the nuclear power industry and other science-related careers are a challenge, thanks to the lure of big money from finance jobs and start-ups. The dearth is particularly severe in India. As this still-developing nation builds seaports, roads and other big infrastructure projects, companies are paying top dollar for engineering students from the best schools. At the same time, the continued growth of the outsourcing industry is attracting good English speakers, with its possibility of international careers and competitive pay. Entrepreneurial types, meanwhile, are being drawn to emerging industries like telecommunications and retail. Still, the challenge to building a nuclear work force is not primarily money. Starting salaries in the nuclear industry are about 30,000 rupees ($678) a month, comparable with other white-collar, entry-level jobs in India. And the positions can come with perks like subsidized housing. The tough part seems to be persuading top students to study nuclear power in the first place — and, if they do, to keep them in India. “We find that all the bright students who go to elite schools, after engineering they do not do science,” said R. B. Grover, the director of Homi Bhabha National Institute, a special university set up by the government to train students in the industry. The few that do are often poached immediately by nuclear programs in the rest of the world. Of the dozen graduates from Delhi University’s doctorate nuclear program this year, eight got job offers from European companies, Mr. Grover said. Homi Bhabha National Institute has 1,100 students enrolled now, mostly from smaller towns and second-tier schools, who hold bachelor degrees in engineering. The Institute provides a one-year training course in nuclear sciences, and then the students do on-the-job training and are certified by the government before they can work in a plant. Indian nuclear experts say that number needs to jump significantly, or India will need to scale down its nuclear plans.",2011-04-15T01:31:07.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-global-business

Under a proposal announced on Tuesday, Pacific Gas and Electric would shutter the Diablo Canyon Power Plant, the state’s last operating nuclear facility, and would compensate for the lost output with technologies that do not emit greenhouse gases, including renewable energy. The proposal, part of an agreement with environmental and labor groups, is intended to help meet California’s aggressive clean energy goals, which have already transformed the power mix with a large and growing renewable energy fleet at a time of slowing electric demand. It also comes after years of public pressure to close the plant, near San Luis Obispo, because of safety concerns over its location, near several fault lines, and its use of ocean water for cooling. Because of state energy policies, “there’s just not going to be enough need to have to run your nuclear plant,” Tony Earley, PG&E’s chief executive, said in a conference call with reporters. “It’s a much smaller generating system.” Under the proposal, which would require the approval of the California Public Utilities Commission, the plant’s two reactors would be shut down in 2024 and 2025, when their operating licenses expire, as long as the State Lands Commission extends a permit set to expire in 2018 that grants access to the ocean for the cooling operation. The future of many of the country’s 99 nuclear reactors — a majority of which are more than 30 years old — is looking grim . The flood of cheap natural gas and slowing demand for electricity have driven down power prices, making it difficult for the aging plants to compete in wholesale markets. In recent years, several plants have shut down before their licenses expired, and more early closings are planned or threatened around the country. Outside of a few areas, there has been little recent appetite to replace the old-style plants, which can take decades to plan and license and are expensive to build. The Tennessee Valley Authority this month announced the start of power production at the second reactor of its Watts Bar plant, whose construction had been halted since 1985. In Georgia, Southern Company is building two new nuclear units. There is not much else in the pipeline. But nuclear plants provide nearly 60 percent of the country’s carbon dioxide-free power. So some state and federal officials and environmentalists have been scrambling to help save the plants to meet national goals to stem climate change. Some nuclear advocates were critical of the plan for Diablo Canyon and expressed skepticism that the utility could fill the gap without relying on fossil fuels. A rise in greenhouse gas emissions has tended to follow closings of nuclear plants, as they have most often been replaced by natural gas. That was the case in New England and California after Vermont Yankee and San Onofre shut down. But the plan for Diablo Canyon, which began operating in 1985 and stirred controversy from the start, is aimed at avoiding that, its proponents say. Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor, helped jump-start discussions on closing the plant as a member of the State Lands Commission, in part to allow for a slower, greener transition. “The sudden closure of San Onofre, which ultimately led to not only significant job losses but also led to significant greenhouse gas emissions — that recent example highlighted my concerns around Diablo,” he said. The state’s evolving policies require utilities to include 50 percent renewables in the power they provide by 2030, to sharply reduce electricity sales through efficiency measures like programs that pay customers to reduce use in times of high demand, and to include the use of energy storage technologies. That, combined with the increasing availability of renewable energy from large-scale wind and solar farms, as well as rooftop systems spreading throughout the state, means that the need for conventional nuclear plants, whose output is difficult to adjust quickly, is diminished. “Giant baseload nuclear power plants like Diablo Canyon cannot easily be taken offline, or ramped up and down, as system needs change,” said Ralph Cavanagh, co-director of the energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council and the group’s lead negotiator on the agreement. “This worsening problem is forcing the California grid operator to shut down low-cost renewable generation that could otherwise be used productively.” As part of the agreement, PG&E promised to exceed the state mandate by including 55 percent renewables in its generation mix by 2031, and plans to spend $350 million on helping retain or retrain affected employees. Executives estimate that decommissioning the plant will cost roughly $3.8 billion, a $1.3 billion increase over its last estimate in 2012.",2016-06-21T17:01:45.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-
981f6c27-3b4d-40d2-b04d-de3c9c46fbe9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/business/energy-environment/hitachi-horizon-wales-nuclear-plant.html,Hitachi to Cease Work On Wales Nuclear Plant,"Hitachi said on Thursday that it was suspending work on a 15 billion pound, or $19.3 billion, nuclear power project in North Wales after failing to agree on financial terms with the British and Japanese governments. “The decision was made from the viewpoint of Hitachi’s economic rationality as a private enterprise,” the company, based in Japan, said. Ben Russell, a spokesman for Hitachi’s British venture, Horizon Nuclear Power, said that discussions with the governments would continue but that its staff, currently around 300 people, would be cut to “a minimal handful.” Hitachi will also stop planning work on a second project, in Oldbury, England. The company said it planned to take a write-off of 300 billion yen, or $2.75 billion, on the projects. The decision by Hitachi is a blow to the British government, which is betting heavily on nuclear installations to help meet the country’s electric power needs in the coming decades. The big question is whether Hitachi’s move will be a death knell for Britain’s campaign to build nuclear plants, which so far has resulted in only one project under construction. While there are signs that the government is rethinking its energy policy, it was willing to go a long way toward trying to keep Hitachi on board. In a statement to Parliament on Thursday, Greg Clark, the secretary of state for business and energy, said the government had been willing to consider providing one-third of the equity financing for the project and to take on all of the construction debt. When Hitachi continued to balk, Mr. Clark said, “I was not prepared to ask the taxpayer to take on a larger share.” The Hitachi plant would have been a big boost for the struggling local economy in North Wales, providing up to 850 permanent jobs. Anglesey Island, where the plant, called Wylfa Newydd, was to be built, will most likely feel the harshest impact. Llinos Medi, leader of the Anglesey Council, the local government authority on the island, said in a statement that she was concerned about the suspension’s “immediate impact on local men and women whose employment is at risk as a consequence of this suspension.” For Hitachi, though, the announcement could mark the end of a long and expensive saga. The company acquired the Horizon sites from two German utilities in 2012 for £697 million, or about $900 million, and wound up spending around £2 billion in total on design approvals, staff and other matters. It has been hiring apprentices, who have been training at a technical college on the island and going to Spain and Japan for work experience. At times in recent months more than 100 archaeologists were on the site, excavating and recording ancient structures that the construction would have destroyed. Hitachi hoped Britain would prove to be an international showcase for its reactor designs. Ultimately, the company lost patience with the high level of spending required to land such a project there. Hitachi had sought to arrive at a financial arrangement that would attract long-term investors like pension funds to the project and reduce its own exposure. But the offers of support from both the British and the Japanese sides were not enough. In an interview on Thursday, Duncan Hawthorne, Horizon’s chief executive, said the Wales site was very attractive and had a supportive community, but that alone, he added, is not enough to attract outside investment. Investors, Mr. Hawthorne said, were put off by the eight- to 10-year wait for a return, as well as the risks of cost overruns and other issues. With the project gaining momentum and spending rising, “it became too much for Hitachi to keep going,” he said. Mr. Hawthorne said Hitachi would prefer to return to Britain as a supplier rather than a developer taking on large upfront risks. In his statement, Mr. Clark said it was clear that the government needed to consider a new approach to financing large nuclear projects. He also said the government was considering supporting small nuclear reactors, including a consortium led by Rolls-Royce, the British jet engine maker. Hitachi’s stepping back from Britain leaves France’s state-controlled EDF Group and its Chinese partner, CGN, as the only companies pursuing nuclear power projects in the country. EDF, through a British subsidiary, owns Britain’s operating nuclear power plants; with CGN, it is building Britain’s first nuclear plant since the 1990s in southwest England at a cost of £20 billion. CGN wants to build a plant in eastern England. China now has by far the world’s largest nuclear building program, but it is largely domestic. CGN would like to use Britain as a steppingstone to an international nuclear business, though there is skepticism in Britain about relying on companies tied to Beijing for a strategically important service like electric power. The dwindling number of companies willing to make the huge investments required to develop nuclear plants also reflects the falling costs of renewable energy sources, like solar and offshore wind. “The economics of the energy market have changed significantly in recent years,” Mr. Clark said, with the cost of renewables trending downward and those for nuclear plants rising. Antony Froggatt, a nuclear analyst at Chatham House, a research organization, noted that nuclear energy was costly and controversial, and that having a foreign company like Hitachi build a plant in Britain was unlikely to contribute to building a British industry. “For all those reasons,” he said, “nuclear falls away.”",2019-01-17T12:26:20.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

Mr. Noda declared units No. 3 and No. 4 at the Ohi Nuclear Power Plant in western Japan to be safe based on the results of computer simulations designed to check the reactors’ tolerance of a large earthquake and tsunami like those last year that knocked out cooling systems at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The resulting meltdowns and explosions spewed radiation across a wide area of northeastern Japan and the Pacific Ocean in the worst nuclear accident since the one at Chernobyl a quarter century earlier. Mr. Noda now faces the tricky task of convincing skeptical local leaders and voters in Fukui prefecture, where the Ohi plant is located, that it is safe to turn the reactors back on. Public concerns about safety after the Fukushima accident have prevented Japan from restarting any of its nuclear reactors as they have been gradually taken offline for legally mandated maintenance checks. Currently, only one of the nation’s 54 commercial reactors remains in operation, and it is due to be shut down for maintenance in early May. The shutdowns, which have cut the nation’s electricity supply by up to a third, have raised cries of alarm from business groups about higher energy prices and the risk of power cutoffs. The minister of industry, Yukio Edano, warned on Friday that the power shortages are likely to be felt most acutely during the summer, when people turn on their air-conditioners. He said that unless Ohi and other plants were turned back on, the plant’s operator, Kansai Electric Power, might be able to generate only 80 percent of the amount of electricity used during past summers. “I have to say we are facing the risk of a very severe electricity shortage,” Mr. Edano told reporters. Mr. Edano said he would travel to Fukui over the weekend to persuade local leaders to accept the restart of the Ohi plant. He will meet with Fukui’s governor and also with the mayor of the town of Ohi, both of whom have called for new safety standards that reflect the lessons of the Fukushima accident. Last week, Mr. Noda’s government adopted those new standards, and asked plant operators to submit plans for improving defenses against tsunamis and for other safety measures. Faced with complaints that the upgrades could be dragged out over several years, the government forced some operators to introduce the new measures more quickly.",2012-04-13T21:48:15.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Yet it is needlessly raising the risks of proliferating nuclear arms by choosing plutonium to fuel its nuclear power plants. A Japanese freighter slipped away from protesters in Cherbourg after picking up some 1.7 tons of plutonium from a French reprocessing plant. This is the first large-scale shipment of commercial plutonium fuel, the opening step toward global trade in this dangerous material. Less than 20 pounds of reactor-grade plutonium is enough to build a crude nuclear bomb. Critics fear such shipments could be seized by terrorists or might catch fire and pollute the oceans. That seems unlikely on this first shipment, which will be closely monitored. But there's no denying the long-term risk of trafficking in plutonium. Japan has a cheaper and safer way to assure its energy security well into the next century: Buy uranium from Russia, which has vast uranium deposits and substantial stocks in nuclear bombs it is dismantling. Low-enriched uranium fuels all but a handful of nuclear power plants. It is more plentiful and cheaper to produce than plutonium, which does not exist in nature but can be extracted by reprocessing spent fuel from nuclear power plants. Uranium fuel cannot be used in bombs unless it is enriched. That makes it less attractive to nuclear renegades than reactor-grade plutonium, which is much easier to use in low-yield bombs. By reprocessing spent fuel in plants in France and England, Japan intends to recover at least 40 tons of plutonium in the next decade. Simply keeping track of that amount, never mind protecting it against theft, is a daunting task. When Japan first looked to plutonium as a commercial fuel two decades ago, experts envisioned it as an almost unlimited source of fuel for their energy-starved country. That's because a breeder reactor can use plutonium to produce still more plutonium. But breeder technology has proven difficult to master, and uneconomical. Meanwhile supplies of uranium, while ultimately exhaustible, are proving plentiful -- even more so with the dismantling of nuclear arms after the cold war. The U.S. recently concluded a deal to buy enough uranium extracted from Russian arms to fuel all of Japan's power plants for 24 years. Japan has yet to buy any. It could do so at a fraction of the price of producing plutonium. That would greatly ease the proliferation risk. Without Japan as a customer, France's reprocessing plant would close down and new plants in France and England need never open. Japan could take the lead in banning all reprocessing plants and breeder reactors, instead of adding to the world's glut of deadly plutonium.",1992-11-10T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,opinion

Few would disagree that coal plants and radon gas in buildings should be cleaned up. However, these problems provide no excuse for playing down the hazards associated with nuclear-power generation. Radioactive wastes have been mismanaged by the Federal Government for the last 40 years. From the leaking tanks of radioactive wastes at Hanford, Wash., to the totally unsuitable salt mines of Lyons, Kan., the Federal waste program has been marked by incompetence. Unfortunately, the Department of Energy - now being sued by at least nine states - continues this heritage today in its hasty efforts to build a repository and declare the waste problem ''solved.'' Nor do Professor Cohen's arcane calculations of nuclear risks solve the many serious safety problems plaguing the nuclear industry. Corroding steam generators, cracking coolant pipes, inadequate equipment for fire protection, poor operator training, inadequate quality control and a host of other problems continue to pose real safety risks for the public, not to mention economic risks for utilities. Finally, we take umbrage at Mr. Cohen's labeling the Union of Concerned Scientists as ''antinuclear.'' For the last 15 years we have presented sound technical analysis on numerous nuclear-safety issues ranging from the inadequacy of emergency core-cooling standards to the serious technical flaws of the Reactor Safety Study. As a direct result of our organization's efforts, many safety improvements at nuclear plants have been mandated, including a strengthening of Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards for fire protection and equipment qualification. The Union of Concerned Scientists position has always been pro safety, not antinuclear. JAMES J.

The pledge from the official, Gregory Jaczko, the commission’s chairman, drew praise and criticism that was often consonant with a lawmaker’s political position on nuclear power and other forms of energy. “U.S. nuclear facilities remain safe,” Mr. Jaczko told two House Energy and Commerce subcommittees , which had originally planned to consider his agency’s budget for the coming fiscal year at the hearing. “We will continue to work to maintain that level of protection.” Reactors are designed to meet the challenges of “the most severe natural phenomena historically reported,” he said. For earthquakes, that means any that occur within 200 miles of the reactor, and a margin of error, he said. While it remains unclear if the crisis at Fukushima will be as serious as the Chernobyl nuclear plant explosion in Ukraine in 1986, it will have much more direct implications for the American civilian power plant industry. At the time of the accident in Ukraine, then ruled by the Soviet Union, the United States had only one reactor that remotely resembled the Soviet one, and it was soon closed. Yet a score of reactors in this country are very similar to the ones in Japan. Some members of the committee seemed satisfied with Mr. Jaczko’s replies and turned to a variety of other energy questions. “I personally believe that nuclear energy must be part of any portfolio of renewable energy sources that will fuel this country moving forward,” said Representative Bobby L. Rush of Illinois, the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Energy and Power of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. On the Senate side, Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who is chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, told Mr. Jaczko that his agency should consider shutting down some older plants until more was known about the shortcomings of the reactors in Japan and the dimensions of the crisis. “I’m looking at you for more leadership than I’ve gotten,” she said. The secretary of energy, Steven Chu, took a position similar to Mr. Jaczko’s in testimony at the House hearing. “We are going to be looking very, very closely at the events happening in Japan and take those lessons,” he said. “You can be assured, with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission leading, but the Department of Energy providing any assistance, to look again at the current, existing nuclear power plants and any that are being considered.” Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, badgered Dr. Chu on whether the administration still favored federal help for new reactors. Dr. Chu gave a professorial answer, but Mr. Barton cut him off and cornered him into whittling his response down to one word, “yes.” “That’s what I wanted you to say,” Mr. Barton said. Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, was not satisfied. “We do have a problem that now, so much of our eggs are in the nuclear basket,” he said, referring to the nation’s reliance on nuclear power for roughly 20 percent of its electricity. “After Chernobyl, many said such an event could not happen in the U.S., because the Soviet Union’s nuclear sector was not as advanced as our own,” Mr. Waxman said. “But Japan is a highly developed country. It is as technologically sophisticated as us, and there’s much concern in the U.S. that a similar accident could here.” Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, renewed calls for delaying the licensing of a new reactor, the Westinghouse AP1000, until everyone was satisfied about its ability to perform in earthquakes. Last month the Nuclear Regulatory Commission signaled that it was moving toward approving the reactor design, which would be deployed for projects like an expansion of Plant Vogtle in Georgia, where holes have been dug for two AP1000 reactors. Mr. Jaczko tried to explain to the House committee that his agency did not require reactors to be designed to meet an earthquake of a certain magnitude, but rather the likely ground-shaking motion at their locations. He demonstrated by filling a glass half full of water and thumping his hand on the table to make the water move. Representative Lois Capps, a California Democrat, complained that the commission had stopped short of considering the possibility of near-simultaneous catastrophes, like an earthquake and a tsunami. “We have just witnessed an earthquake, a tsunami and a meltdown,” she said.",2011-03-17T03:25:37.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-science-environment
de4aaaaa-0b20-4083-8b7d-5bd004fe6154,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/21/world/chernobyl-answers-new-questions.html,CHERNOBYL ANSWERS: NEW QUESTIONS,"The Politburoreport issued Saturday on the Chernobyl nuclear disaster seemed a far cry from the terse initial announcement issued 68 hours after an explosion ruptured the fourth reactor. Instead of the simple ''accident'' reported then, the Politburo this time spoke of ''gross breaches,'' ''grave consequences,'' direct losses amounting to $2.7 billion, hundreds of thousands of medical examinations and penalties against high officials ranging from firings to criminal proceedings. Yet beyond the catalogue of damage and the lists of culprits, much of which has been reported in the press in the three months since the disaster, the Politburo statement offered only a new hint about what had caused the explosion in the fourth reactor - an unspecified and unauthorized experiment. Although the reactor was down for routine maintenance, the Politburo said, managers and specialists at the Chernobyl reactor conducted experiments with the ''turbogenerator operation regimes,'' experiments that violated operating procedures and were neither cleared with higher authorities nor properly prepared for. Central Questions Unanswered But the Politburo gave no indication what the experiments were, or how they led to the accident, leaving a central question about the disaster still unanswered. More detailed explanations could emerge with publication of the full report of the Government investigative commission, on which the Politburo's statement was based. The Soviet Union has said it will share its findings with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. But the statement seemed designed less to explain the disaster than to depict it as an isolated incident caused by human irresponsibility and negligence, one therefore that did not reflect on the overall safety of Soviet atomic plants or, more broadly, on Moscow's ambitious nuclear-energy program. The rapid expansion of nuclear power has been a major element in Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of economic revival. At the Communist Party congress in February, Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov declared that ''by the end of the five-year period nuclear power stations will nearly double their share of power production and will account for 20 percent of the total amount generated.'' Plans' Targets Unchanged In the wake of the Chernobyl explosion, Soviet officials have repeatedly insisted that the disaster would not affect the development of nuclear power. Specific targets for the next five-year economic plan, which were published after the disaster, showed no changes that might have resulted from the Chernobyl disaster. The Politburo statement did suggest a broader concern with the safety of nuclear power by demanding ''additional measures to insure the safe operation'' of existing stations and the retraining of service personnel, and by forming a new Ministry of Atomic Power Engineering. What was missing from the report, however, was any suggestion that the Kremlin's own insistent demands for rapid expansion of nuclear energy could have contributed to the accident. The entire responsibility was apportioned among the power plant's officials and Government ministries, and no blame fell on party officials or party policy. According to some rumors in Moscow, the experiments may have been a local initiative to make power generation more efficient, in keeping with the Kremlin's directives to modernize and update Soviet industry. Party Policy Above Reproach The Politburo's approach, in any case, was hardly unusual; party policy is generally held above reproach in the Soviet Union, and blame for failures usually falls on specific ministries and responsible officials. But some diplomats thought the Politburo's statement could have a chilling effect on Mr. Gorbachev's campaign to instil more initiative and autonomy in Soviet industry. After the stern penalties and reprimands meted out to ministers, officials and technicials over the Chernobyl matter, the diplomats thought, industrial managers might be wary of undertaking independent experiments, even if the potential repercussions were nowhere near those of Chernobyl. In listing six senior officials who were dismissed or censured over Chernobyl, the Politburo said only that they were guilty of ''bad errors and shortcomings in their work,'' giving no indication of their specific contribution to the accident. Establishing Link to Military One of those whose dismissal was announced was a Deputy Minister of Medium Machine Building, identified in the Tass version of the Politburo statement only as Meshkov. According to Western experts, the ministry, under its cover name, is concerned with the development, testing and manufacture of nuclear warheads and other military-related nuclear programs. Mr. Meshkov's inclusion in the list of culprits contributed to speculation that the Chernobyl plant may have been used also for producing plutonium for thermonuclear bombs. Another possibility was that Mr. Meshkov was being penalized for earlier work on civilian power, since an Aleksandr G. Meshkov had been listed since 1971 as a deputy chairman of the State Committee for Utilization of Atomic Energy. The Politburo laid the heaviest blame on the Ministry of Electric Power and the State Committee for Safety in the Atomic Power Industry, charging that they were ''guilty of lack of control'' at the Chernobyl plant. Their senior officials evidently were penalized because the disaster fell under their jurisdiction, even if they were not directly to blame. Anatoly I. Mayorets, only recently appointed Minister of Electric Power, escaped with a ''strict reprimand'' because he was only recently appointed to the post, while a Deputy Minister, Gennadi A. Shasharin, who had specific responsibility for nuclear power, was dismissed. Also sacked was Yevgeny V. Kulov, head of the State Committee for Safety in the Atomic Power Industry, which was set up by the late Yuri V. Andropov in July 1983, reportedly after a lesser Soviet atomic-energy accident that was never reported by Moscow.",1986-07-21T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world

Members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission today defended its recent efforts to hold down the nuclear industry's costs by requiring fewer safety-related changes in reactor equipment. The topic was the subject of a hearing by the House Interior Committee's Subcommittee on Investigations. Representative Sam Gejdenson, a Connecticut Democrat who heads the subcommittee, accused the five-member commission of ''tying its own hands'' by allowing the nuclear industry to dissuade the commission's technical staff members from ordering certain safety improvements at nuclear power plants. These include regulatory changes intended to improve the margin of safety at existing nuclear plants by tightening prior standards for pumps, piping, cable and fire protection. Fewer changes would lower the costs of the nuclear industry. 'Greater Discipline' Imposed ''The N.R.C. is no longer requiring safety improvements in nuclear power plants'' and is ''on the path toward non-regulation of the nuclear industry,'' Mr. Gejdenson said. The subcommittee had earlier accused the nuclear power agency of ''coziness'' with the industry it regulates under the Reagan Administration. Lando W. Zech Jr., the commission chairman, said the commissioners had imposed ''greater discipline'' on their staff engineers that might result in reducing the number of safety-related equipment changes at nuclear reactors. This, he said, was intended to make ''more efficient use of resources in protecting public safety.'' But he added, ''This does not mean that we are complacent.'' Other witnesses testified that when the commission adopted its 1985 rules on tightening safety standards at existing plants and modified the rule under court order last month, it had required commission staff members who proposed reactor equipment changes to prove that such changes were cost efficient. The commission's original order, requiring reactor safety changes to be ''cost effective,'' was rejected unanimously last month by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals here. The court held that cost factors could not be considered in commission rules meant to assure the public's health and safety. Ellyn R. Weiss, testifying today for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nuclear safety group, said an amended rule proposed by the commission would do little to reassure a commission staff she described as wary of proposing safety revisions for fear of having to devote months to elaborate cost justifications. The staff is even reluctant to ask reactor operators for safety data ''for fear that the licensee could demand a prior cost-benefit justification,'' she said. Victor Gilinsky, an N.R.C. commissioner under President Carter, testified that in accepting the nuclear industry's complaints that it has been ''roughly treated'' by overzealous safety regulators, the commission ''has curbed any staff inclination to propose new requirements.'' He said the reason for inhibiting the technical staff ''is to signal the removal of what are seen as regulatory obstacles to future nuclear plant orders.''",1987-10-15T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

In addition, the owner of the largest share in the plant, the Public Service Company of New Hamsphire, declared bankruptcy last year.

The winning bid by Entergy Nuclear, of Jackson, Miss., for the Indian Point 3 plant in Buchanan, in Westchester County, and the James A. FitzPatrick plant in Oswego County, broke ground in myriad ways. It was the largest sale of a public asset in New York State history. It was the first transaction involving the privatization of a publicly run nuclear plant in the country. And the $967 million price tag was at least four times as much as any previous sale of a nuclear plant, based on dollars per generating capacity. It may have been the ultimate sign of the resuscitation of an industry once thought to be too moribund, costly and unsafe to continue operating that the sale yesterday occurred on the 21st anniversary of the industry's darkest moment in the United States: the Three Mile Island partial core meltdown in Pennsylvania. Entergy's offer topped an unsolicited, last-minute offer from Dominion Resources of Richmond, Va., valued at $946 million. Both offers are at levels far below what was invested to build the plants. In that sense, the offers reflected the depths to which nuclear power had fallen as well as its improved safety record since Three Mile Island and the improved prospects for keeping aging nuclear plants in operation. But the fact that there were two major companies dueling for two plants with spotty records illuminated how utility deregulation and rock-bottom prices helped provide a market for plants that in the past might not have found a buyer. ''There was no market a year and a half ago,'' said Clarence D. Rappleyea, the chairman and chief executive of the power authority, at a signing ceremony after the trustees' meeting in Manhattan. But like any enormous transaction involving real estate -- much less one with thousands of employees -- this one is fraught with potential pitfalls. So how the transfer of ownership, expected to take six months, plays out may affect the structuring of deals for plants like the two Millstone reactors for sale in Waterford, Conn., and Consolidated Edison's Indian Point 2 plant in Buchanan, next to Indian Point 3. ''This is unique,'' Mr. Rappleyea said. ''This is not anything that there's a road map to. I guess we're cutting new trail here.'' For the power authority, the proposed sale, which is still subject to approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, would free resources to pay the remaining debt of $316 million on Indian Point 3, and to focus more on economic development and energy efficiency, Mr. Rappleyea said. Eventually, Mr. Rappleyea predicted, there will be a ''distinct possibility'' that the sale will result in lower electric bills. For Entergy, a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation in New Orleans, the sale would put it in a commanding position to dominate the nuclear power industry in New York State. The company is already bidding to operate two other upstate plants, the Nine Mile Point reactors, which are adjacent to the Fitzpatrick plant in Scriba, on Lake Ontario. And yesterday, Entergy offered its bluntest statement about its interest in the troubled Indian Point 2 plant, which had a radiation leak last month at its Hudson River site, about 35 miles north of New York City. ''We would very much like to buy that plant and put these two plants with some synergies, pull them back together, and operate them the way they were originally designed to operate, as a single entity,'' said Jerry W. Yelverton, the chief executive of Entergy Nuclear, referring to Indian Point 2 and 3. (Indian Point 1 closed in 1974.) Some watchdogs of nuclear power, though, were ambivalent about the sale. For months, many legislators, environmentalists and professors criticized the bidding process as being less than competitive and open, since Entergy was the preferred choice all along. And yesterday, some said that while the $967 million figure sounded impressive, it was almost $200 million more than Entergy's original bid -- and stoked speculation as to what a thoroughly open process might have produced. ''We would've been better off putting this on eBay in the beginning, and letting the market drive the price,'' said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly Committee on Environmental Conservation. Mr. Brodsky also questioned why the five trustees, all Republicans, did not delay their decision another month or so to consider the deal's financial ramifications. But Mr. Rappleyea said that the longer the board waited, the less likely it would be able to close the deal before a scheduled refueling at the FitzPatrick plant this fall -- a possible $30 million expense. Under the deal, Entergy would pay $636 million for the plants, $171 for nuclear fuel stockpiles, $92 million for eventual decommissioning expenses and $68 million in return for the power authority's commitment to buy more electricity in the future. Entergy would also guarantee employment, and no contractual changes, for the 1,700 workers -- almost half of whom are unionized -- at the two plants and the power authority's office in White Plains. The power authority is expected to pay most of the costs of the eventual decommissioning, and has been building a fund, now valued at $630 million, in anticipation of those obligations. By 2015, when the licenses of both plants are to expire, that fund is expected to be worth $1.9 billion -- more than enough to cover the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's projection of $1.18 billion to decommission the plants. But if that fund were subject to taxes because the public power authority sold its plants to a private entity, or if that fund were counted as taxable income for the new owner, then taxes would sap that $1.9 billion. And while that possibility is highly unlikely, the possible exposure to as much as $250 million in tax liability proved to be a crucial turning point in favor of Entergy, because Entergy had said it would assume that liability, while Dominion had not. Yesterday, the board was careful to praise both bids as tremendous. But Dominion, clearly, felt that it had not gotten a fair shot. ''We are disappointed that N.Y.P.A. presented us with a complex tax issue at the 11th hour of its meeting on March 20 and gave us only eight days to resolve it,'' Thomas E. Capps, Dominion's president and chief executive, said in a statement.",2000-03-29T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Friday in response to Russia’s attack and capture of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which caused worldwide alarm about the potential for a nuclear accident if the conflict in Ukraine is not contained. The United States and its allies denounced Russia for the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine, calling it a threat to civilians and a reckless escalation. They condemned the seizure of the plant and called for Russia to withdraw its troops from Zaporizhzhia and from the former Chernobyl nuclear plant in northern Ukraine. “By the grace of God, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night,” said Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. “Mr. Putin must stop this madness, and he must stop it now. Cooler heads must prevail.” Early on Friday, as fighting reached the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia plant, a fire started at a training building. The fire was extinguished, and the plant appeared to be safe on Friday. Ukrainian officials and the International Atomic Energy Agency said the fire had been contained without damage to the reactors or other equipment, and that radiation levels had not increased. “This is the first time that a state has attacked a fueled and functioning nuclear power plant,” said Britain’s U.N. ambassador, Barbara Woodward, who had called for the Security Council meeting. “It must not happen again.” Russia’s ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, told the council that the allegations that Russia had attacked the nuclear site were “lies” and part of an anti-Russian campaign. He said the emergency meeting had been called to “kindle artificial hysteria about what is taking place in Ukraine.” Mr. Nebenzya offered a different account of the incident, saying that Russian troops patrolling the area of the nuclear facility had come under fire from Ukrainian forces inside the training building and had returned fire. He accused Ukrainians of setting the blaze. “Our servicemen are not interfering with the work of the operators of the power plants and only working to ensure stability,” Mr. Nebenzya said, adding that Russia had experienced the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and did not want to see another nuclear accident. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, briefed the council from an airplane en route to Iran. Mr. Grossi said he had proposed to the Ukrainian and Russian authorities that he travel to Ukraine as soon as possible and visit both nuclear sites, Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia, to establish a framework to protect them. Mr. Grossi said his mission would not be political and would be restricted to ensuring “the safety and security of nuclear establishments of Ukraine, which, as facts have shown, are in constant danger of accidents.” He added that the Zaporizhzhia facility was operating normally, but said he had informed the I.A.E.A. board of governors that “there is no normalcy to the situation when there are military forces in charge of the site.” Beyond the statements of diplomats, the Security Council cannot take significant action against Russia because the country has veto power over legally binding resolutions. Russia vetoed a resolution last week that condemned its invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its troops. The U.N. General Assembly, a 193-member body, passed a resolution on Wednesday that condemned the invasion and called for humanitarian access and a diplomatic solution. That resolution, which was politically symbolic but not legally binding, passed with 141 countries voting in favor, demonstrating Russia’s isolation on the world stage, diplomats said. Russia voted against the measure, joined by Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea and Syria.",2022-03-05T08:32:49.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Credit... David Guttenfelder for The New York Times KYIV, Ukraine — Following a string of Ukrainian military successes in the south, the Kremlin sought on Monday to tamp down speculation that Russian forces would withdraw from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex, with President Vladimir V. Putin’s spokesman saying that Moscow has no plans to end its military occupation of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. “One should not look for signs where there are none and cannot be any,” said the spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov. Mr. Peskov’s comments came after some pro-Russian military bloggers wrote posts suggesting that Moscow’s forces would withdraw from the area, and after Ukrainian officials said there were indications that Russia was taking steps to leave the facility. Russian forces seized the Zaporizhzhia plant soon after invading Ukraine in late February, stationing troops and military equipment there. A withdrawal from the plant would mark another setback for Russian forces in a region that Mr. Putin has sought to annex illegally. On Sunday, Petro Kotin, the president of the Ukrainian state nuclear energy company, Energoatom, said that there were signs that Russian troops were “packing and stealing whatever they can find” at the Zaporizhzhia complex, although he emphasized that there was no evidence that the troops had actually begun to pull out. Ukrainian forces in recent weeks have scored a series of victories in southern Ukraine, including retaking the key city of Kherson on Nov. 11. But military analysts said that there was no immediate indication that they were threatening Russia’s grip on the plant, which lies on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, about 100 miles northeast of Kherson. Instead, the reports from Russian military bloggers — a hawkish and pro-invasion group — suggest concerns about Moscow’s ability to hold the plant and could be an attempt to “prepare the information space for an eventual Russian withdrawal” from Zaporizhzhia, the Institute for the Study of War, a research group that tracks the conflict, wrote in its daily analysis on Sunday. The nuclear plant — which provided 20 percent of Ukraine’s electricity before the war — has careened from one crisis to another since Russian forces seized the facility on March 4. Shelled repeatedly, it has cycled down all of its reactors as a safety measure and has been disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid on multiple occasions, forcing it to use diesel generators to perform critical cooling functions. The Ukrainian staff members operating the plant, whose numbers have more than halved, have reported being detained and abused by Russian soldiers. Witnesses also have accused the Russian forces of laying mines in and around the plant. After a team of inspectors from the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, visited the plant in September, the head of the agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, called for the creation of a demilitarized safe zone around the facility to reduce the risk of a nuclear catastrophe. Ukraine has supported the proposal, as have representatives of the European Union and the United States. Russia has resisted the idea, with its Foreign Ministry saying recently that it would “make the power plant even more vulnerable.” Mr. Grossi said that he had discussed his concerns with both Mr. Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, telling CBS News’ “60 Minutes” last week: “Until we have this plant protected, the possibility of the nuclear catastrophe is there.” On Nov. 20, the day that interview aired, the plant was rocked by more than 10 explosions. Energoatom said that Russian troops were responsible for the blasts and had targeted infrastructure necessary for electricity production for Ukraine. Russia has blamed Ukraine for shelling the plant. Repeated waves of Russian missile assaults on Ukraine’s energy grid infrastructure have resulted in widespread and prolonged power outages in nearly every corner of the country. Millions now live with sweeping but controlled blackouts for long stretches of the day and night. Last week, a wave of Russian missile strikes forced all four of the country’s nuclear power plants offline for the first time in Ukraine’s history. The plants have since been reconnected to outside power.",2022-11-28T14:04:31.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Dick Thornburgh of Pennsylvania and the state's two Senators urged the Nuclear Regulatory Commission today to postpone a vote on the resumption of nuclear power production at Three Mile Island. The vote is scheduled for next week. A majority of the five-member commission has long been believed to favor restarting Unit 1 at the power plant near Harrisburg, the undamaged twin of the Unit 2 reactor that was wrecked in a March 1979 accident. That partial meltdown, the worst mishap in the 30-year history of commercial nuclear power, remains as much a psychological yoke upon the whole nuclear utility industry as a fiscal burden on the General Public Utilities Corporation, its owner, and the Three Mile Island decision is seen as having widespread significance. At a crowded hearing the commission had billed as its last before a final vote next Wednesday, Mr. Thornburgh said the move to a decision was ''ill timed, ill conceived and inexplicable.'' The commission voted in February to proceed toward next week's scheduled vote without awaiting the outcome of several investigations of accident-related charges against the company and the commission, a decision Mr. Thornburgh has challenged in Federal court. 'Little to Assure the Public' The Governor was joined today by his fellow Republicans, Senators Arlen Specter and John Heinz, in calling for a postponement of the vote until what he called questions about the company's ''competence and integrity'' to operate ''the world's most infamous nuclear power plant'' were fully aired. Saying it would ''create the appearance of a cover-up, undermining the credibility of the commission,'' Senator Heinz warned that ''the way not to do this is allow a start-up and see what happens.'' But Representative Don Ritter, one of three Pennsylvania Congressmen who testified today, ''commended'' the commission for ''recognizing that a decision should now be made.'' According to Governor Thornburgh, ''The clearest lesson learned from the crisis of 1979 was that practicing restraint under pressure is a far wiser course than gambling with decisions made in the dark.'' He said that the conduct of both the commission and the company ''has done little to assure the public that the T.M.I. company of 1985 represents a significant change in attitude from the T.M.I. company of 1979.'' A company spokesman, Lisa Robinson, told reporters that the Governor's statement was ''wrong'' and ''unwarranted.'' At the end of the three-hour hearing, top executives of General Public Utilities said the company was a changed, chastened and more mature licensee, worthy of the commission's and the public's trust. The current Three Mile Island operating company, the GPU Nuclear Corporation, is a subsidiary of the General Public Utilities Corporation of Parsippany, N.J., that was formed in 1982 to succeed the Metropolitan Edison Company, the operating utility at the time of the Unit 2 accident. Company Backed by N.R.C. Staff William G. Kuhns, the chairman of the holding company, and executives of the utility itself today repeated statements of confidence and readiness, and they were supported by representatives of the commission's legal and technical staff. Philip R. Clark, the GPU Nuclear president, noted the reams of material generated in the six years of investigation and litigatin since the Unit 2 accident. ''In view of the severe adverse effects of continued shutdown,'' he said, ''we believe that both law and fairness require that the lifting of the shutdown order be made immediately effective.'' If the commission does give its final impramatur to a restarting, that action is certain to draw a rash of challenging lawsuits, so the actual restart could be delayed for months by litigation. Several witnesses opposed to power production at the plant promised such legal challenges today. Ready to Power Soon Douglas Bedell, a company spokesman at the reactor site, said that barring successful court intervention by opponents, the refitted and modified Unit 1 reactor could be brought to marginal ''criticality,'' for low-power testing, within a week. ''We could be producing some electric power in a couple of weeks,'' Mr. Bedell said. ''But the process of getting reliability and going to 100 per cent of power will probably take a couple of months.'' At criticality, the reactor core would be brought for the first time in six years to the controlled edge of the powerful nuclear reaction capable of producing 960 megawatts of power. This stage of cautious, gradual ''powering up'' may also be critical -literally - for Unit 1's repeatedly overhauled steam generators, a pair of massive heat exchangers that isolate the high-temperature, pressurized radioactive water passed through the reactor core from the nonradioactive steam used to drive the plant's huge electric power generator. These crucial units have been described by commission technicians as the most ''degraded'' of any in the nuclear industry. Like an automobile radiator, the Unit 1 steam generators contain bundles of thin alloy tubes that have required extensive repairs or, in some cases, plugging to prevent leakage of radioactivity into the turbine steam system. The repaired tubes of the heat exchangers have been tested so far only with nonnuclear energy.",1985-05-23T09:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,national-desk-u.s.

Rowe, told analysts in a conference call, in which he cited the current credit crisis. But the deal would raise credit challenges; Exelon is assuming that because of bond covenants, sale of NRG would require Exelon to refinance $8 billion in debt and that interest rates would run into double digits. Executives held out some hope, though, that they might be able to renegotiate with the current bondholders, rather than refinance. The transaction would depress Exelon’s credit rating but it would remain investment grade, company executives said, and would return within two or three years to its current level. NRG, with 44 generating stations spread across Southern California, Texas, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New York and Connecticut, had no immediate comment except to say that it was evaluating the offer with its advisers. The $6.2 billion bid is an all-stock offer, 0.485 share of Exelon for each share of NRG. The offer is a 37 percent premium over NRG’s closing price last Friday, Exelon said. While the market tumble has lured various bargain-seekers into the utility business, one analyst on the call, Steve Fleishman, of Catapult Capital Management, said that the ratio in stock price between the two companies had not changed much between the beginning of the credit crisis and last Friday, when the offer was priced. Both prices are now depressed, according to analysts. Exelon, already one of the nation’s largest electric companies, covers a broad swath of the Midwest and Middle Atlantic states, combining the assets of Commonwealth Edison and Philadelphia Electric. A successful deal would require Exelon to sell some assets in Texas and in the Pennsylvania or Delaware areas. But it would give the company very broad geographic diversity, Mr. Rowe said, and access to plants using a variety of fuels. According to the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association of the investor-owned utilities, Exelon ranks sixth nationally in generating capacity and fourth in megawatt-hours produced; the merger would make it No. 1 in both categories. It has assets of $49.5 billion as of the end of last year, ranking third; combining with NRG’s $19.3 billion in assets, it would also rank first, the institute said. Exelon’s operations focus heavily on nuclear- and coal-fired plants. NRG has several coal-powered plants assets in Texas, a major share of a twin-unit nuclear plant there and plants fired by natural gas and oil. Joelle Frank, a spokeswoman for NRG, said the company had advised its shareholders to “take no action, pending review by NRG’s board.” NRG has hired Citigroup and Credit Suisse to advise it, she said. Exelon said the combination would produce an enormous combined entity with investment-grade credit ratings and the financial strength to build new power plants. NRG ranks well for creditworthiness among independent power producers, but many experts say they think that its plan to build two new nuclear reactors adjacent to its South Texas reactors faces challenges. “NRG’s South Texas Project nuclear plant and the very valuable expansion rights could be worth more in the hands of Exelon,” said John Kiani, a senior utilities and power analyst at Deutsche Bank. A year ago, NRG asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for permission to build two nuclear reactors at a site 90 miles southwest of Houston, the first time since the mid-1970s that anyone had sought permission for a new nuclear power plant in the country. Exelon is one of the nation’s largest and most successful nuclear operators. But the promised resurgence of nuclear power has been thrown into some doubt because of the credit crisis. Mr. Kiani said the offer “materially undervalues” NRG. Both NRG and Exelon have sold their output in advance and will probably realize higher cash flows once those contracts expire, he said. Another looming uncertainty is regulation of carbon emissions. Exelon, anticipating such regulation, has begun a project to lower emissions substantially within its service territory by 2020, and said it would devise a similar program for NRG. NRG is part of a coalition of companies seeking such regulation. If a schedule of emission limits is imposed, that could help Exelon, which has a huge fleet of zero-carbon nuclear plants. It would also create certainty for NRG.",2008-10-21T01:13:04.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day
708e9f62-c8fa-472a-aaf2-08fc46bde7e6,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/us/politics/trump-uranium-import-probe-tariffs.html,U.S. Inquiry Into Uranium Imports May Signal New Front in Trade War,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said on Wednesday that it was starting an investigation into uranium imports, potentially opening another front in an expansive trade war that has shaken alliances with countries around the world. Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, said the department would investigate whether imported uranium ore and related products — key ingredients in America’s nuclear arsenal, and used in power production and nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers — threatened national security. Uranium produced domestically now fills only 5 percent of America’s needs, Mr. Ross said, down from half in 1987. The uranium inquiry is the latest of several trade-related steps the Trump administration has taken with an eye toward imposing stiff tariffs on imports. Levies have already been placed on washing machines, solar-power products, steel and aluminum from overseas, and on an array of Chinese goods. The administration is also considering whether to impose tariffs on imported cars and car parts. The investigation announced on Wednesday was requested by two American uranium mining companies, Ur-Energy and Energy Fuels. The firms say low-priced imports, especially those from competitors supported by foreign government subsidies, had caused them to slash jobs in recent years. Nuclear power producers have responded by warning that sharp restrictions on uranium imports could lead to the closing of plants. The uranium imported into the United States now comes mostly from Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan and Russia. “If we did not take this action, this industry would become extinct,” said Jeffrey T. Klenda, the chief executive of Ur-Energy. “And if we allow it to die, resurrecting it will be monumentally expensive. We cannot leave the fuel cycle in the hands of Vladimir Putin and his confederates, and increasingly the Chinese.” Mr. Klenda said that uranium producers in the United States, as well those in allied countries like Canada and Australia, were suffering, while state-subsidized companies in Kazakhstan have rapidly gained global market share. Shares of Ur-Energy and Energy Fuels both rose on Wednesday. But the nuclear power industry has warned that an aggressive attempt to restrict access to imported uranium could increase the cost of operating America’s nuclear power plants, many of which already struggle to compete with lower-priced natural gas and renewable energy. Nuclear power provides 20 percent of America’s electricity, a fraction that is set to wane in the coming years: Since 2013, six of the nation’s nuclear reactors have shut down permanently , and 11 others are scheduled to be retired by 2025. President Trump, who often talks about the benefits of nuclear power, has ordered the energy secretary, Rick Perry, to “prepare immediate steps” to stem the closing of reactors. But new trade barriers on nuclear fuel could further strain the industry. “Maintaining all the elements of the domestic uranium fuel supply is in our national interest, and we urge the federal government to take appropriate action, without harming the fleet of nuclear reactors,” Maria G. Korsnick, head of the Nuclear Energy Institute, said in a statement. The companies that requested the trade case asked that the Commerce Department limit imports so that 25 percent of the uranium used in the United States would be produced domestically. The companies argue that doing so would pose minimal burdens on nuclear power plants. The companies that operate the plants dispute that idea , pointing to a recent study from NorthBridge Group, a consulting firm, that looked at the impact of such a quota, which would require domestic producers to expand their operations sharply in just a few years. Doing so would cost the nuclear power industry $500 million to $800 million per year, the study found, increasing the average cost of electricity from nuclear reactors by around 2 to 3 percent. “We sympathize with the plight of uranium suppliers,” Ms. Korsnick said on Wednesday. “However, N.E.I. does not support the implementation of quotas as described in the petition. Potential remedies could put even more generating units at risk for premature closure.” It is unclear what the Trump administration will ultimately propose with regard to imported uranium. If it determines that unfair trade practices are hurting domestic mining companies, the Commerce Department can recommend a broad range of remedies, from strict quotas to temporary tariffs. Such a decision would be expected to play out over several months, as the department continues its investigation and holds public hearings. The investigation into uranium imports — as with those involving steel, aluminum cars and car parts — is being conducted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, a legal provision that gives the president broad power to impose tariffs on imports that he determines pose a threat to national security. The use of a national security-related law to place tariffs on close military allies like Canada and the European Union has been a source of contention. Multiple countries have retaliated by imposing tariffs on American goods and have challenged the Trump administration’s measures at the World Trade Organization. In particular, trade experts say that the administration’s imposition of tariffs for national security reasons — a matter the World Trade Organization does not closely regulate — opens a potential loophole that other countries could use to put their own levies on a range of products. “If the U.S. has rewritten the rules of the W.T.O. system to say you can do anything you want if it’s in your national security interests, be prepared for every country in the world to come up with a new definition of what is its critical national security interest,” said Rufus Yerxa, the president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents exporters in the United States. Congress has considered taking action to stay the administration’s use of the national security provision to impose tariffs. Republican leaders have shown limited support for such a move so far, but that could change as the administration’s trade measures become more far-reaching. “If the administration continues forward with its misguided and reckless reliance on tariffs, I will work to advance trade legislation to curtail presidential trade authority,” Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said Tuesday. “I am discussing legislative options with colleagues both on and off the Finance Committee, and I will continue to do so.”",2018-07-18T19:41:06.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-u.s.-politics

The state was one of the first to jump in, and now seems on its way to being one of the first out. The technology once seemed a natural fit for the state, which has only two traditional energy resources: the little bit of hydropower that nurtured its earliest industries, and the technological sophistication of its work force, from engineers to technicians to mechanics. It also has a thirst for energy for its high-tech factories, offices and homes. But the idea that nuclear power is dependable and economical has come and gone over the past 20 years, and the idea that power can be cleanly, cheaply supplied by fossil fuels imported from far away has gone and then come back. The changes are stunning. Twenty years ago, Connecticut Yankee was on its way to earning the record as the largest single nuclear producer of electricity in the world, in the vanguard of a wave of reactors that were supposed to total 1,000 by the turn of the century. Millstone 1 and 2 were helping to minimize the impact of oil price shocks, and Millstone 3, under construction, promised to further loosen the treacherous noose of oil dependency. But that was not all. Stamford was headquarters to Combustion Engineering, which built nuclear reactors and in Uncasville, another firm built nuclear fuel. Electric Boat, in Groton, turned out a steady stream of nuclear-powered submarines and the United States Navy ran a landlocked submarine reactor in Windsor Locks, for training. Almost all of that has gone away. ''We wouldn't have predicted it,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, of the industry's withering. ''Ultimately, I think it's bad.'' Nuclear reactors can run well, he said, even if Northeast Utilities' reactors don't. ''In Connecticut the problem is basically a screw-up in the management,'' he said. Someday, he said, more will be built. ''Not tomorrow, but probably in a decade or more -- more like two or three decades -- we will come back to nuclear power because we'll be concerned about the impact of fossil fuels on the economy,'' he said. In the very long term, he said, ''people will start to realize we're running out of fossil fuels.'' Maybe so, but Northeast, which often got more than half its electricity from reactors, got just 28 percent last and this year it will be less. Amazingly, the system still works. Everyone can see that, because the lights stay on and because a web page (http://www.cvx.com/) gives an up-to-the-hour picture of the balance between supply and demand. But as a technology, nuclear power seems to be withering. Combustion Engineering was swallowed by a European conglomerate, Asea Brown Boveri, in 1990, and there are no nuclear reactors to build in this country; only a few around the world. The site of the nuclear fuel plant is prospering as a casino. Of the 259 power reactors ever ordered in this country, more than half were canceled. The Navy closed its training reactor, because it sends fewer crews to sea now. That has also cut most work at Electric Boat, which is building one last big attack submarine. And Connecticut Yankee, reliable though it was for most of its life, turned out to be not worth running. Last month the state even argued that it has been poorly run, in a way that increased contamination and the decommissioning cost. More stunning yet, though, is Millstone 3, a multibillion-dollar miscalculation. When ground was broken it was supposed to cost $400 million. By the mid 80's the price had risen to over $3.5 billion, but Northeast Utilities said its power would be cheaper than oil-fired power as early as 1989. The utility hired a forecasting company, then called Data Resources Inc., which said that not only would oil be expensive, but that low-sulfur fuel, the kind Northeast burned, would reach $181 a barrel by the year 2000. If that seemed outrageous, Data Resources had company; the United States Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration predicted a world oil price of nearly $300 per barrel by then, assuming continuing high inflation. There seemed no alternative to pressing on. But for the last few years oil has sold for about $20 a barrel. And most electricity comes from something even cheaper: natural gas. Twenty years ago, Connecticut was at the end of a very long natural gas pipeline from the Gulf Coast, meaning shortages for the state; now, it is in the middle, served by a pipeline from Canada as well, the Iroquois. ''The Iroquois was a signpost of things to come,'' said James R. Shuckerow, the director of wholesale power contracts at Northeast. ''No longer will New England be at the end of the pipeline. In many respects, we are at the beginning.'' Gas coming over the Iroquois is mostly from western Canada, but Mr. Shuckerow and others say that newly discovered gas in the Canadian Maritimes may put New England even nearer the beginning of the distribution system. Joel M. Rinebold, the executive director of the Connecticut Siting Council, a state agency that passes judgment on each proposed new power plant, said that today, ''There are more options and alternatives, as simple as that.'' These include conservation and new technologies that are just becoming competitive or are expected to be soon: solar cells, wind turbines and fuel cells, the latter manufactured in the state. Those alternatives have had a profound effect on the value of Millstone 1 and 2, because they determine the value of a kilowatt-hour, and thus the value of the plants' output and therefore of the plants themselves. The Department of Public Utilities Control asked Northeast to recalculate reactor value on that basis, and in July the company said that the value to its customers of operating Millstone 1, as opposed to closing it, was a scant $68.9 million. Millstone 2 was $488 million. People with long experience in the energy field, nuclear and otherwise, are stunned by the changes. Paul Blanch, for example, moved to Connecticut in 1966, as an instructor at the submarine reactor in Windsor Locks, and went on to become a nuclear engineer at Northeast Utilities. He, like the state, has made a long journey since then; he found technical flaws with nuclear reactors and said the company harassed him as a result; eventually the Nuclear Regulatory Commission agreed. He quit four years ago but was rehired in February, to help fix the company's nuclear problems. Two years ago the four reactors represented about one-sixth of the capacity the state would need on a peak day, and to Mr. Blanch and many others, the idea of the state doing without all of them was impossible. ''I didn't think we could possibly survive,'' he said. ''It's all economics right now,'' said Mr. Blanch. ''The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the nuclear industry is well aware of the non-competitive or borderline competitive situation nuclear is in.'' Companies have been scrimping, he said, and the government is ignoring safety problems because ''they have to not impose anything significant that's going to cause economic hardship on these utilities.'' At the Connecticut Siting Council, Mortimer A. Gelston, the chairman, said that in the next year and a half the state as likely to see 1,500 megawatts of new natural gas-powered electric generating capacity. That is almost half as big as the shut-down nuclear capacity. ''We're going to be pretty dependent on gas, which bothers me,'' said Mr. Gelston. That fuel, he said, is ''nothing but a stop gap measure to get us out of this hole we're in.'' He and others point out that at the time Millstone 3 was being built, natural gas was in such short supply that a Federal law barred construction of new plants using it. He, too, is surprised that the state has done well with no reactors. Of Northeast's executives, he said, ''they all must have gone to church every Sunday to get through this year.'' The constant factor is that nothing has been constant. Mr. Rinebold, of the siting council, also teaches a course in environmental issues at Central Connecticut State University in New Britain. As teaching materials he keeps the old Data Resources projections ''as an example of the dynamics of our fuel supply,'' he said. ''Even with the best projections, the best forecasts, things change.''",1997-10-05T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Over the past decade, an influx of cheap natural gas and the rapid rise of renewable energy have transformed the nation’s power sector, driving down wholesale electricity prices and pushing many older coal and nuclear plants into unprofitability and retirement . In September, Mr. Perry warned that the loss of these plants could threaten the “reliability and resiliency of our nation’s grid” and asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees regional electricity markets, to guarantee financial returns for power plants that can stockpile at least 90 days’ worth of fuel on-site — which, in effect, meant propping up uncompetitive coal and nuclear units. (Natural gas plants are typically fed by pipeline and would not qualify.) While a few utilities with significant coal and nuclear capacity supported the idea, Mr. Perry’s proposal generated a fierce backlash from a broad coalition of energy companies, free-market groups and former regulators. Critics argued that Mr. Perry’s proposal would upend competition in the nation’s electricity markets, which have been deregulated in much of the country since the 1990s and currently tend to favor the lowest-cost sources of power. Opponents of Mr. Perry’s proposal also pointed out that blackouts usually occurred because of problems with transmission lines — not because power plants had insufficient fuel on site. In its decision, the commission largely sided with the critics, noting that grid operators have so far proven adept at keeping the lights on even as natural gas, wind and solar have crowded out baseload coal and nuclear plants, which were once favored by utilities because they can reliably generate power at all hours of the day. “There is no evidence in the record to suggest that temporarily delaying the retirement of uncompetitive coal and nuclear generators would meaningfully improve the resilience of the grid,” wrote Commissioner Richard Glick, concurring with the agency’s decision to reject the proposal. “Rather, the record demonstrates that, if a threat to grid resilience exists, the threat lies mostly with the transmission and distribution systems, where virtually all significant disruptions occur.” The agency did add, however, that it would investigate potential threats to the resilience of the grid from natural disasters and other disruptions, giving grid operators 60 days to submit comment. At that time, it could issue a new order to tweak rules in competitive electricity markets. “I appreciate the Commission’s consideration and effort to further assess the marketplace distortions that are putting the long-term resiliency of our electric grid at risk,” Mr. Perry said in a statement. “As intended, my proposal initiated a national debate on the resiliency of our electric system.” President Trump has vowed to revive the ailing coal-mining industry, and his administration has moved to relax a variety of climate and pollution regulations on the nation’s coal plants. So far, however, those rollbacks have failed to halt the market forces that continue to drive coal plants into retirement. Last year, utilities announced plans to shut down more than 22 gigawatts of coal capacity across the country, and more retirements are expected this year. Mr. Perry’s proposal was the most aggressive move yet in support of coal and nuclear power and would have shielded a number of plants in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic from those competitive forces. An analysis by Resources for the Future estimated that the rule, if enacted, would have prevented the retirement of 25 gigawatts of coal capacity and 20 gigawatts of nuclear capacity. The analysis found that the proposal would have cost electricity users an extra $72 billion through 2045. While coal is more polluting than natural gas, nuclear plants do not produce any emissions, and some states like New York have moved to rescue their ailing reactors to help combat climate change. The commission’s decision would not affect those state efforts. The commission’s unanimous decision to reject Mr. Perry’s proposal is final. While four of the five members of the commission were nominated by Mr. Trump, the agency has historically operated independently of the executive branch and tends to be protective of the competitive market structure built up over the past three decades. “There is clearly a broad consensus among commissioners of both parties that the carefully constructed competitive power markets that FERC has created over the last 30 years are keeping consumer prices low,” said Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate change adviser. “The notion of subsidizing coal and nuclear and thereby raising consumer prices is anathema to Trump appointees and Democrats alike.”",2018-01-09T00:35:15.000+01:00,NYTIMES,climate-climate

Credit... Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters Ukraine accused Russian forces on Sunday of firing rockets that landed on the grounds of a nuclear power plant that Russia has seized in the south of the country, further raising the risk of an accident at a complex where the United Nations’ nuclear agency has said that the principles of nuclear safety have been violated. A pro-Russian regional official blamed Ukrainian forces for the attack. The rockets fired Saturday evening landed near a dry spent fuel storage facility, where 174 casks are stored, each containing 24 assemblies of spent nuclear fuel, according to Enerhoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear energy company. One person was wounded by shrapnel and many windows were damaged. “Apparently, they aimed specifically at the casks with spent fuel, which are stored in the open near the site of shelling,” the company said in a post on the Telegram social messaging app. Three radiation detection monitors were damaged so “timely detection and response in case of aggravation of the radiation situation or leakage of radiation from spent nuclear fuel casks are currently impossible,” the post said, adding that a catastrophe was “miraculously avoided.” Russian forces have controlled the Zaporizhzhia plant since March. A representative of Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate, Andrei Yusov, said that Russia was shelling the site to destroy infrastructure and damage power lines that supply electricity to Ukraine’s national grid and, ultimately, to cause a power blackout in the south of the country. There was no independent confirmation of the assertion. The head of the pro-Russian administration in Zaporizhzhia, Yevgeny Balitsky, said on Telegram on Sunday that Ukrainian forces had used an Uragan cluster rocket to target the spent fuel storage area and damage administrative buildings. On Thursday, Russia’s defense ministry said that Ukraine had launched an artillery strike against the plant. During a national television phone-in show on Sunday, the head of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, Oleksandr Starukh, said that there was only a three-second delay between the firing and the landing of each shell, using this as evidence that the attack had come from Russian forces nearby. Since invading Ukraine in February, Russia has made it a priority to seize critical infrastructure including power plants, ports, transportation, and agricultural storage and production facilities. It has also targeted infrastructure in Ukrainian hands. In an earlier post, Enerhoatom said that Russian shellfire had damaged a nitrogen-oxygen unit and the combined auxiliary building. “There are still risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances, and the fire hazard is also high,” the post said. Mr. Yusov also said on Telegram that Russian forces had laid mines at the plant’s power units. Concern about safety at Zaporizhzhia has been mounting since March when a fire broke out in a building during fighting as Russian forces took control. The Ukrainian authorities say that Russian forces have since stored weapons including artillery at the plant and in recent weeks began shelling Nikopol, a nearby city held by Ukraine, from positions on its grounds. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in a speech late on Saturday that there had been “significant worsening of the situation around the plant,” and added that Russia has become the first country in the world “to use a nuclear plant for terror.” On Sunday, he spoke with the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and said in a tweet that he had called for a stronger international response against Russia’s “nuclear terror.” The prospect of a Ukrainian counteroffensive to reclaim land in Kherson Province, which is southwest of Zaporizhzhia, also heightens instability. Ukraine was the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident when, in 1986, there was a reactor fire at Chernobyl in the north of the country. There are no reports of a radiation leak at Zaporizhzhia. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said that a particular concern is its inability to access Zaporizhzhia for monitoring purposes. Ukrainian plant workers operate under stress, in part because Russian authorities suspect the possibility of sabotage, and the exiled mayor of the nearby city of Enerhodar, Dmytro Orlov, has said that some workers have been interrogated or have disappeared, and at least one has been killed.",2022-08-07T17:11:49.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Contemplating a post-nuclear era, the purchasers of the idle Shoreham reactor on Long Island today toured a failed nuclear project here that is about to emerge as a huge gas-fired electric plant. The buyers, five officials of the Long Island Power Authority, are hoping to extract from Shoreham some value that could be used to pay for decontamination and cut the Island's rising electricity costs. Their hosts, executives of the utility that built the nuclear project here, are hoping to sell the skills they developed in their conversion, which will be completed next month, and to get a foothold in the lucrative market for electricity in the Northeast. The authority will be given Shoreham, on which the Long Island Lighting Company has spent more than $5.5 billion, as part of a settlement between New York State and Lilco. The settlement assures that Shoreham is not used as a nuclear plant but does not specify what it will be used for. Greater Capacity William T. McCormick Jr., the chairman of CMS Energy, the parent of the utility that tried to build the reactor here, estimated that Shoreham might be worth $500 million to $600 million as the foundation of a new electric plant. Converting it to gas would require $400 million to $800 million more, depending on the size of the plant desired, he said, and the plant might end up with a substantially greater capacity than the 800 megawatts that were expected from the nuclear Shoreham. ''I promise you that we can do it better than anybody in the world, because we are the only ones who have done it,'' Mr. McCormick said, as the visitors, their shoes caked with mud from a walking tour of the site, clearly warmed to the idea of finding a use for a slightly radioactive white elephant. But a tour of the Midland Cogeneration Venture, previously the Midland nuclear plant, showed that ''conversion'' might be too strong a word. Because of major differences between a natural-gas-powered plant and a nuclear one, the plant itself is less valuable than the land, the connection to the power grid and the cooling water supply. Questions Remain The Midland Cogeneration Venture found a market for electricity for a broad area of the Midwest and for steam for an adjacent Dow Chemical plant. There is no market for the waste steam produced at Shoreham, which is in a largely residential area on the Island's North Shore about 110 miles from New York City. Major questions about Shoreham remain. One is whether it would be cheaper to start over in other locations. Another is whether the money for conversion might be better spent on increased efficiency by Long Island's electricity users, possibly saving more power than a converted Shoreham would generate. Other questions include who would own such a plant and who might buy its power. CMS would like to sell the electricity in Connecticut and New Jersey, among other places. Conversion to gas also presumes the completion of the Iroquois gas pipeline, which would run from the Ontario border to Long Island, linking New York with the gas fields of Alberta. The pipeline has not received final approval. For the Long Island Power Authority, a public agency made up mostly of long-time opponents of the reactor, another issue is whether the conversion poses a risk of technical complications and cost overruns. 'Risk Free for Us?' On the flight here from Detroit on one of CMS's three jets, Richard Kessel, chairman of the authority, told Mr. McCormick: ''Shoreham has been a toothache on Long Island for 20 years. We don't want another 20-year toothache. The last thing I want to do is become another Lilco.'' Mr. McCormick replied: ''We can do it for you. If you contribute the non-nuclear asset, we will contribute all the cash, the equity and debt.'' ''Risk free for us?'' asked Mr. Kessel. ''Risk free for you,'' Mr. McCormick responded. Many companies that generate electric power say that even without the nuclear reactor to make steam, Shoreham's turbines, which convert steam to mechanical energy, and its generator, which converts mechanical energy to electricity, are still useful. But the turbine is designed for steam of much lower temperature and pressure than that produced by burning natural gas or coal. Giant Jet Engines The solution proposed by CMS is to install gas turbines, which are essentially giant versions of jet engines, that run on natural gas. The mechanical power made by the engines would be turned into electricity, and the 1,000-degree exhaust gas would be used to boil water into steam. Here in Midland, 110 miles north of Detroit, the steam from a row of 12 turbines is piped into the old turbine hall of the nuclear plant, where it spins a conventional turbine and makes yet more electricity. But another member of the Power Authority's board, Thomas Twomey, said that the old turbine would not be practical except in a large-capacity plant, and that it would never run as efficiently as one designed for the job from scratch. Among those seeking to convince the Power Authority that the conversion will work was Matthew C. Cordaro, a vice president of Long Lake Energy Corporation, of Melville, L.I., which owns several independent power plants. Mr. Cordaro said he knows the issue well, because in the 1970's, as a vice president of Lilco, ''I used to be responsible for all those studies that said you couldn't do anything else with Shoreham.'' One impediment to a conversion -and even to the Power Authority completing the purchase from Lilco - is the Federal Department of Energy, which is trying to block the abandonment of the reactor. But Mr. McCormick predicted that if a conversion were planned, ''I couldn't imagine the Department of Energy being so irresponsible as to hold it up.'' CMS is helping conduct a study of conversion under a $150,000 contract between the Power Authority and Reseach Management International of Sacramento, Calif. Mr. Cordaro's company is assisting in the study. Mr. McCormick said CMS could perform the decontamination of the Shoreham reactor for the authority. The current plan is for the New York Power Authority to supervise that work.",1990-01-19T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Below, we answer three of your questions on the topic: Are we on the brink of nuclear war? When asked this question, President Biden had a curt answer: “No.” After the invasion of Ukraine, Putin ordered Russia’s nuclear forces into a higher state of alert, the first time the Kremlin had done so since the Russian Federation was established in 1991. This came after issuing thinly veiled threats of a nuclear attack should any foreign power try to stop him from war. America appears to be calling Russia’s bluff (or at least the Biden administration wants to appear stoic in the face of a real threat). Still, Russia and the U.S. control 90 percent of the world’s nuclear weapons, so any talk of a nuclear attack raises questions no one has seriously been asking since the end of the Cold War. Since that time, the doctrine of “mutually assured destruction” — that no state will start a nuclear war because sure retaliation would put its own fate in question — has kept nuclear weapons from being launched. While the threat being issued by Putin should be taken seriously, experts say, this doctrine should still hold. After all, Putin’s goal is to reclaim former Soviet glory, which would be hard to do if Moscow was jeopardized by retaliatory nuclear missiles. What other nuclear risks exist? But this doesn’t mean there aren’t other nuclear concerns to be thinking about. One particular concern is the safety of the nuclear waste caught in the crossfire in Ukraine. Specifically, atomic experts have been carefully watching the state of the Chernobyl nuclear facility which recently came under Russian control. Chernobyl was the scene of the worst nuclear disaster in history when one of its four reactors exploded and burned 36 years ago, and the long-defunct plant in Ukraine is completely dependent on outside sources of electricity. Experts were alarmed this week when the plant lost outside power, posing grave concerns over the storage of nuclear waste in the long term.",2022-03-12T02:08:33.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

The sale, expected in the first half of 2005, would increase the portion of Areva's shares that are publicly traded to 35 to 40 percent, France's finance minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, said in a statement. The partial privatization of Areva, the world's largest maker of nuclear reactors, comes as the government-owned company is trying to raise its international profile. The company is competing for an $8 billion contract from China to build four nuclear reactors. Last month it began a $250 million project for the United States government to convert weapons-grade plutonium into mixed-oxide fuel rods for civilian use. Areva has a market value of more than 10 billion euros ($12.9 billion), based on a closing price Wednesday of 288.80 euros for nonvoting investment certificates. The company had a net profit of 243 million euros ($313 million) in the first half of this year. Last week the company said, without giving its earnings, that its group revenue for the fiscal year to Sept. 30 rose by 31.6 percent, to 7.7 billion euros. ''We are ready,'' Areva's chief executive, Anne Lauvergeon, said of the share sale. ''This increase in our float capital will provide us with the resources we need to continue expanding.'' The government said the proceeds of the share offering would be used to help cover the costs of dismantling 15 nuclear sites run by the Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique, the nuclear power agency that holds the bulk of the government's stake in the company. Denis Guelen, an analyst at the French brokerage Fideuram Wargny, said that growth prospects for the nuclear power sector remained moderate, especially in Europe, where political opposition to nuclear power is still strong. But soaring economic growth in Asia and increasing awareness of the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, along with the desire to renovate and upgrade existing nuclear sites in North America and Russia, will combine to guarantee ''solid fundamentals'' for the industry in the decades to come, he said. Mr. Sarkozy announced the Areva share sale just weeks before his planned resignation at the end of this month. France's most popular politician, Mr. Sarkozy is running for head of the governing Conservative Party before an expected bid for the French presidency in 2007. In his final months in office, Mr. Sarkozy has sought to accelerate the privatization of a number of government-run companies, seeking cash to reduce a government deficit that is expected to reach 50 billion euros this year, about 3.6 percent of gross domestic product. On Tuesday, the government-owned Société d'Autoroutes Paris-Rhin-Rhône, Europe's third-biggest toll-road operator, began selling up to 1.35 billion euros in shares; in September, the state sold 5.1 billion euros worth of shares in France Télécom, bringing its stake in the phone company below 50 percent for the first time. In June, Mr. Sarkozy oversaw the sale of a 35 percent stake in the aircraft engine maker Snecma, raising 1.15 billion euros. In addition to Areva, other government-owned groups slated for partial privatization next year include the utility group Électricité de France and Aéroports de Paris, the operator of the capital's two main airports, Roissy-Charles de Gaulle and Orly. Correction: November 13, 2004, Saturday An article in World Business on Thursday about a French government plan to sell a one-third stake in the nuclear power group Areva misstated the period for the company's 7.7 billion euros in revenue ($9.9 billion). It was the first nine months of this year, not the 12 months ended in September. Because of an editing error, the article also misstated the political affiliation of the finance minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, who announced the sale. It is the Union for a Popular Movement, a conservative party. (There is no French Conservative Party.)",2004-11-11T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business

But an evaluation by a prominent electricity analyst finds enormous subsidies for the nuclear industry, along with enormous costs incurred directly by the utilities. The question of which energy forms the Government should support is drawing increased attention with the change of administrations. President Jimmy Carter won huge increases in Federal support for renewable energy resources and plans to replace oil with fuels derived from coal and other sources. As Presidents, Ronald Reagan and George Bush vigorously backed nuclear power. President-elect Bill Clinton and Vice President-elect Al Gore have talked about returning to renewable fuels and promoting natural gas and conservation. A Contrarian View The Government study, released Wednesday, contradicts some conventional thinking about Washington's role in energy prices. It found, for example, that the oil industry, thought of as pampered with Government support, paid more in taxes than it got in benefits. The study says a shift to conservation and use of renewable sources of energy, which the Clinton team advocates, has to a large extent already occurred. The study, ordered by Congress last year, concludes that Government subsidies to the energy industry are equal to 1 to 3 percent of the value of all energy consumed, or $5 billion to $13 billion a year, depending on how a subsidy is defined. The nation's total yearly energy bill is $475 billion, the study found. ""Contrary to what might be the popular impression, energy is not heavily subsidized,"" said Calvin A. Kent, administrator of the Energy Information Administration, an independent statistical agency within the Energy Department. But the study did find that some energy sources, like gasohol and natural gas recovery from coal seams, existed only because of subsidies. In contrast, a separate study to be released in a few days by Greenpeace, the environmental group, concludes that taxpayers have spent nearly $100 billion to promote nuclear power. The total, stated in 1990 dollars to account for inflation since the first expenditures in the early 1950's, said the subsidy amounted to 1.6 cents for every kilowatt-hour of electricity produced with nuclear power from 1968, when the first large plants began operating, until 1990. 'An Official Technology' The Greenpeace study was written by Charles Komanoff, a New York-based electricity analyst who has been comparing the costs of competing sources for 20 years, and an associate, Cora Roelofs. It excludes benefits received from Washington by the nuclear industry like ""the ideological support which crowned nuclear power an 'official technology' and won investor confidence."" The study puts the total cost of a nuclear kilowatt-hour at just over 10 cents. The figure includes $347 billion spent to build, fuel and operate reactors and to begin programs to tear them down when they retire. The utilities have spent $48 billion on indirect costs, including waste disposal and investments in plants that were canceled. Both numbers were stated in 1990 dollars. In contrast to the 10-cent figure, which is a wholesale figure, the average cost of a kilowatt hour to all customers in the first eight months of this year was 6.6 cents, according to the Energy Department. Mr. Komanoff said the investments in nuclear power had not been worthwhile, adding that they were a warning ""to be more tolerant of teething costs for renewables and energy efficiency."" ""I don't mean that I or anyone else wants to spend half a trillion dollars on solar energy or wind,"" he said. ""But when you see eyebrows being raised because a couple of hundred million is going to photovoltaic solar cells or a wind farm, you have to put it in perspective."" The Government study also found a heavy subsidy for nuclear power but did not compare the figure with the cost per kilowatt hour. It found that for fiscal 1992, direct appropriations for nuclear power were $890 million for research and development and $9 million in regulatory costs borne by taxpayers. But nuclear power also has benefits separate from Congressional appropriations: it enjoys a partial exemption from liability for reactor accidents, which the study valued at $3 billion a year in reduced insurance costs. The sector getting the most help, through subsidized loans and Government sales at below-market prices, is electricity, at $1.8 billion, the study found. In contrast, it said the oil industry lost nearly $2.2 billion to the Government, when comparing the value of its tax breaks with the Federal excise taxes on fuel. Dr. Kent said the study did not rank sectors of the energy industry by size of subsidy because many different assumptions went into the counting. But if subsidies were counted on the basis of quantity of energy produced compared with subsidies received, renewable sources, which include solar power, hydroelectricity, wood, wind and other technologies that do not consume fossil fuels, would get $847 million in the current fiscal year. This includes $244 million in research and development funds plus $540 million in tax exemptions and $63 million for help to low-income people. The coal industry is subsidized with $1.1 billion, the study said, with the largest item being $551 million for research into cleaner ways to burn the fuel. Taxpayers will spend $635 million this year to subsidize conservation, the department said. The natural gas industry gets $1.7 billion.",1992-12-14T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business

Gains May Not Aid Nuclear Power,"WASHINGTON THE outspoken supporters of nuclear power are mostly Republicans, and the Republicans are about to take control of the House of Representatives and gain six seats in the Senate. Is this good news for nuclear power? Maybe. But the outlook for a new wave of reactors is still mixed at best. Many prominent Republicans say the United States should embark on a building campaign. Senator John McCain of Arizona, as the party’s 2008 presidential nominee, called for 45 more reactors by 2030, and Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, wants 100 more reactors by then. But the party dislikes something that the nuclear industry needs: global warming rules. Republican progress in the midterm elections probably dooms prospects for a cap-and-trade system on carbon dioxide emissions for now. A price of, say, $20 a ton on carbon emissions would give coal-fired power plants a handicap of about 2 cents a kilowatt-hour and natural gas-fired plants about a penny a kilowatt-hour, large sums for a commodity that sells for an average of 10 cents a kilowatt-hour. Under such a system, nuclear power would face no charges. And while various Republicans may want to see reactors built, the government does not build them; private companies do. “The business environment is a principal driver in what the future of nuclear energy is in the United States,” Alex Flint, the senior vice president for government affairs at the industry’s trade association, the Nuclear Energy Institute, said recently. “How long is the recession going to last?” he asked. “What impact is that going to have on the overall economy? When are we going to see demand forecasts pick up?” A related question is when the price of natural gas, a competing fuel, will rise. These considerations weigh on more than just nuclear reactor construction. “There’s a whole lot of solar and wind that ain’t happening now too,” said Stewart Brand, the creator of the Whole Earth Catalog and a Silicon Valley commentator, who favors more reactors. The “nuclear renaissance” may seem mostly stalled, he said, but “a fair question to ask is, what’s the state of the wind renaissance?” An event in New York just before the election illustrates the problem. Électricité de France, eager to build in this country, ended a partnership with Constellation Energy, of Baltimore, to build a third unit at Constellation’s Calvert Cliffs complex in Maryland, because Constellation said that, with the loan terms that the Energy Department was offering, the economics were not favorable for a “merchant” plant that would sell its output in the daily power auction. In the breakup, the French company acquired a site for a reactor, adjacent to the Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station reactors, near Oswego, N.Y. But the price of electricity in the wholesale market in New York has crashed, at least in the short term. It fell from about $95 a megawatt hour in 2008 to $47 last year, and has only partly recovered. The election will not change that, unless the economy revives sharply, and the manufacturing sector, always a huge consumer of power, comes back. Robert E. Curry Jr., a member of the New York State Public Service Commission, said he could not discuss the Oswego site because the issue might come before the commission, but he spoke about the Maryland plant. “If you’ve got Calvert Cliffs 3, a merchant plant, that’s likely going to cost north of $10.5 billion, and a loan guarantee of $8.5 billion, then you then have to borrow much of the balance, $2 billion,” he said. “With natural gas prices as suppressed as they are, what kind of revenues can you pledge to lenders where the marginal price of electricity is set by gas?” “It’s almost unfinanceable in today’s environment,” he said. “I don’t see how the election changes that for good or ill.” Another indication that the problem may be beyond the powers of Congress comes from Exelon, the nation’s largest nuclear reactor operator, which is not planning any new reactors now. John W. Rowe, the chairman of Exelon, said recently that his company would not break ground until the price of natural gas was more than double today’s level and carbon emissions cost $25 a ton. Nationwide, ground has been broken for just four reactors, two twin-unit nuclear plants since the 1970s. Work is limited to digging the foundations and other site preparation, but both expect that within a few months they will get licenses to construct and operate their reactors. Both are in locations that are insulated from the market, in Georgia and South Carolina. In both locations, the business risk rests with the ratepayers, not with the shareholders. Two proposals were selected by the Energy Department for potential government help, in the form of loan guarantees, one in Texas and the other the Calvert Cliffs project in Maryland. In both places, most electricity is sold in a daily auction, and prices are depressed by gas prices. A Republican House may push Congress toward two steps that would help the nuclear industry: reviving the Yucca Mountain project, which might promise a long-term solution for nuclear waste, and providing more money for loan guarantees and perhaps easing the terms the federal government demands for those guarantees. But President Obama was already enthusiastic about more loan guarantees. And as for Yucca, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, is bitterly opposed, and he survived the Republican tide. The Energy Department sought to revoke its application for a license for Yucca, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had begun preliminary work on determining whether it will let the Energy Department do that. In the meantime, Mr. Obama appointed a commission to consider alternative uses for spent nuclear fuel, including recycling options, and a draft report is expected in May. But it is not looking for new sites. The commission could take other steps, such as endorsing reprocessing, in which uranium and plutonium that can be used in reactors is scavenged from the used fuel, or it could recommend advanced reactors that would destroy the long-lived wastes. Some Republicans favor those ideas. John Reed, an investment banker who specializes in nuclear power plant sales, said the new Congress might “have more of an appetite to tackle the issue now.” “Right now we have zero solutions,” he added. “Anything would be an improvement.”",2010-11-17T00:21:21.000+01:00,NYTIMES,specialsections-business-day-energy-&-environment-
354439a5-e6de-4fb4-918e-7eda1fee4dc2,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/nyregion/new-jersey-renewable-energy.html,A Major Energy Move in New Jersey Lifts Renewable Sources,"TRENTON — New Jersey significantly altered the future of its energy sector on Thursday, passing two bills that set ambitious goals for expanding renewable power and curtailing greenhouse gases in the state. The bills, which require power companies in New Jersey to generate 50 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and subsidize existing nuclear power plants, mark one of the biggest new policy steps that any state has taken toward cutting greenhouse gases since President Trump was elected. The central piece of legislation, Assembly Bill 3723, sets the renewable energy goal and anchors much of the growth in wind and solar energy, aiming to hit 35 percent renewables by 2025 and eventually 50 percent by 2030. That goal would pull New Jersey in line with some of the leading states on the issue, like New York and California. The bill was passed in tandem with a $300 million annual subsidy to the state’s remaining nuclear power plants, which provide the state with roughly 40 percent of its electricity. Public Service Enterprise Group and Exelon, the utility companies that operate the power plants, say the subsidies are necessary to keep the power plants operational and open. The bills passed by a wide margin in both the Assembly and Senate. Since Mr. Trump announced that he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, 14 Democratic and Republican governors have announced that they would continue to uphold the accord and push forward with their own efforts to reduce emissions. But, to date, new progress has been slow. States like California and New York already had progressive clean-energy policies that were well underway before Mr. Trump took office. And few states have managed to significantly step up policy action; efforts to put a price on carbon failed to pass through legislatures in Washington and Oregon this year. But in New Jersey, Gov. Philip D. Murphy has seen some success, and these energy bills, which the governor has indicated he will sign, mark a significant step. Having made environmental issues a focus of both his campaign and his early tenure, Mr. Murphy has already signed numerous executive orders, including one that laid the groundwork for expanding offshore wind energy near Atlantic City. While his administration has struggled to sell the tax increases arising from his inaugural budget to fellow Democrats, he has largely had success when it comes to moving the state forward in combating climate change. “The environmental reality in this state for the past eight years, and if that weren’t enough, the environmental chops of the Trump administration,” Mr. Murphy said in an interview, “felt like an urgent crisis.” The inclusion of the nuclear subsidy, though, has dampened enthusiasm among some environmental groups for the package of measures, exposing the rift among those who view nuclear energy as inherently clean — in that it has no greenhouse gas emissions — and those who view the industry as a threat because of safety, regulation and waste disposal issues. Mr. Murphy is wholly in favor of nuclear energy. “I believe the biggest bridge we have to our clean energy future are the nukes and, not to mention, the thousands of jobs they support,” he said. The ambitious goals set forth in the renewable energy bill have caused concern among some environmental groups usually opposed to nuclear energy. But the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has been supportive of New Jersey’s efforts toward renewable energy, has said it will not oppose the nuclear subsidy bill. “We don’t want to see the abrupt closure of nuclear plants, because if you close them tomorrow, we know that they’ll just be replaced by more fossil fuels,” said Dale Bryk, senior strategic director at the defense council. “You have to have an orderly transition plan that involves scaling up renewables first, so that when the nuclear plants close, they’re replaced with clean energy.” Indeed, environmental groups are increasingly being forced to grapple with the climate consequences of retiring nuclear plants. Across the United States, there are still 99 nuclear power plants in operation that supply one-fifth of the nation’s electricity without generating any carbon dioxide emissions. Six reactors have closed since 2013 and more than a dozen more are scheduled to retire by 2025 unless states decide otherwise. New Jersey’s nuclear subsidy bill is similar to programs passed recently in New York and Illinois, where the Legislature would give the nuclear power plants financial credit for the carbon-free electricity they produce. Every three years, the companies that operate these reactors will have to open their books and show that they need the subsidies to stay operational. In New Jersey, the Oyster Creek nuclear reactor is expected to close, but the subsidies would benefit the remaining three. Still, some environmentalists in New Jersey have scoffed at this plan, viewing it as falling short in transparency for not requiring the utility companies to open their books to the public. And, they assert, the inclusion of the nuclear subsidy taints the clean-energy efforts in the companion bill. “It’s going to put a chilling effect on spending more for renewable energy, because to build out renewable will cost much more,” said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. “This bill is about a nuclear subsidy, and that’s the primary purpose. And that’s the diversion to make you think you’re getting something that you’re not.” The two bills will likely lead to an increase for New Jersey utility ratepayers, though the exact amount remains murky . The cost of subsidizing nuclear energy will be passed down to each ratepayer at a fee of approximately $41 a year, but Mr. Murphy has said he hopes to require public utilities to slash rates based on savings from the new federal tax law, which could potentially offset any increase. The ambitious goals for renewable energy also follow a trend among the cities and states that have pledged to commit to upholding the Paris accord: By exceeding their share of the national commitments that would have existed under the international agreement, the states are accelerating the country’s overall progress, despite the headwinds from Washington. “If you look at the United States commitments under Paris, these percentages would more than uphold New Jersey’s share of the burden,” said Robert C. Orr, one of the architects of the 2015 Paris Agreement as the United Nations secretary general’s lead climate adviser. He is now dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland. “Obviously, New Jersey is a significant state, but it’s not a driver in the same sense that California is,” Mr. Orr said. “But by putting New Jersey in a group with California and New York and then Vermonts and the Marylands, you start to see, not getting all the way to Paris targets, but you start to see the trend line moving toward us meeting Paris.”",2018-04-12T23:13:56.000+02:00,NYTIMES,metro-new-york

But a motion that would have forced the company to abandon its nuclear program was defeated. The management of the operating company, Tokyo Electric Power, or Tepco, as it is known, also pushed through the appointment of 17 board members, including the reappointment of its 71-year-old chairman, raising questions about the extent of the overhaul that the company promised after the nuclear disaster. “I apologize from the bottom of my heart for the trouble and fear that we have brought to our shareholders, and to society,” the chairman, Tsunehisa Katsumata, said at the shareholders’ meeting at a tightly guarded Tokyo hotel. “We will do our utmost to bring the accident to a resolution and to work toward our mission of providing a stable source of electricity,” he said. Some investors refused to be placated. “Go jump into a reactor and die!” one elderly man shouted at the row of executives, before being escorted out by attendants. At one point, when Mr. Katsumata tried to wrap up a question-and-answer session, angry shareholders rushed toward the stage. The session continued. With her voice shaking, a woman told board members that they were unfit to lead the company. She said the company had ignored warnings about the dangers of nuclear power. “Shame on you!” she cried. “You should all be sacked.” Tokyo Electric has been fighting for its survival since the March 11 quake and tsunami ravaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, about 140 miles north of Tokyo, leading to hydrogen explosions and releases of radioactive material in the worst nuclear accident since the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine in 1986. At least 80,000 people in northeastern Japan have fled their homes, and farmers and fishermen in the area have had to abandon their livelihoods. Factories within a 20-kilometer evacuation zone have had to move or close. Tokyo Electric could face as much as 11 trillion yen, or $136 billion, in compensation claims, analysts have estimated. The cost of dismantling the Fukushima Daiichi plant could reach an additional 20 trillion yen, according to the Japan Center for Economic Research. The dismal forecasts have cast a dark cloud on the financial health of Japan’s largest utility, a company with strong links to government that has dominated the country’s power industry for decades. Last week, Moody’s cut Tokyo Electric’s credit rating to junk status, after a similar move by Standard & Poor’s last month. Tokyo Electric shares have plunged more than 80 percent since the earthquake. Prime Minister Naoto Kan has said that the government should provide a safety net for Tokyo Electric, to keep the company afloat while it pays damage claims. Japan is considering setting aside about 230 billion yen from a planned 2 trillion yen supplementary budget to help Tokyo Electric, according to Bloomberg News. Mr. Kan has been eager to hold Tokyo Electric accountable and to avoid having to dip into public money. But he also wants the company to avoid bankruptcy, which would bring chaos to the stock and credit markets. The company had about 933,000 shareholders at the end of March. At that time, financial institutions held about 30 percent of Tokyo Electric shares, while other corporations had 5 percent. Individual investors held about 44 percent, while overseas investors held 17 percent. Nevertheless, many analysts have underscored the need for change at Tokyo Electric. “A fundamental structural overhaul is needed at the board level to enable Tepco to rebuild its reputation and recover financially,” Glass Lewis, a United States company that advises institutional investors, said in a report before the shareholder meeting. Individual investors at the meeting on Tuesday aired similar demands. About 9,300 investors attended the meeting, the most in Tokyo Electric’s history, forming long lines at the hotel location. Antinuclear demonstrators also gathered at a nearby park to urge the company to abandon nuclear power. But even as Tokyo Electric’s board faced a hostile crowd Tuesday, the company management, which has institutional investors and some individual investors on its side, was never in any real danger of defeat. Tokyo Electric won the approval for the appointment of 17 board members, including Mr. Katsumata, the chairman, and Toshio Nishizawa, a longtime company executive, as president. All but one of the directors are company executives, according to company records. A more contentious motion was brought by 402 shareholders who asked Tokyo Electric to shut down its existing nuclear power plants and to stop building new ones. A similar motion had been rejected at each annual shareholders’ meeting for the last two decades. “Do you really want to go down in history as rejecting this motion?” asked an investor who identified himself as Masaki Kito, a lawyer. “Are you prepared to be responsible for the next big accident?” But the motion was voted down, ending the six-hour meeting. Still, the shareholders’ demands mirror a growing antinuclear sentiment among the Japanese public. On June 11, tens of thousands marched across the country, calling for an end to nuclear power in Japan. In a poll published by the Nikkei business newspaper on Monday, 47 percent of respondents said they wanted fewer nuclear power plants in Japan, an increase of 5 percent from a month earlier. Most experts agree that it would be difficult for Japan to permanently close all of its 54 plants without substantial fuel costs, as well as a large increase in carbon emissions. Before the Fukushima crisis, nuclear power provided 30 percent of the electricity needs of Japan, a resource-poor country with few domestic sources of energy to draw on. Still, 35 of Japan’s 54 reactors are already closed for maintenance or safety checks, and others are scheduled to follow, which could leave the country without any nuclear power by next April. To make up for the shortfall, power companies around Japan have increased their purchases of natural gas. At the stricken plant, meanwhile, recovery efforts have been slow and perilous. A circulation system that would allow the plant’s reactors to re-use cooling water — reducing the amount of contaminated runoff — was started Monday but shut down just 90 minutes later. The system was restarted on Tuesday afternoon. Tokyo Electric officials have said that 110,000 tons of radioactive water have already accumulated under the reactors, and that there is a danger that the water will overflow if it cannot be safely removed or recirculated.",2011-06-28T13:19:13.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-global-business

But here among cornfields and crumbling stone homes skirted by persimmon trees, the government intends to build a nuclear power plant. “They want to build it here, right here,” said Wang Jiuxing, a retired village official, tapping his foot outside a dilapidated general store, 540 miles west of Shanghai in China’s central Henan Province. “They say all the preliminary work has been done.” Hubin is one of dozens of sites across the country where officials have plans ready, awaiting further approval, to build atomic reactors over the next decade — an ambitious program to expand the use of nuclear energy that Beijing considers essential to weaning the Chinese economy from its reliance on coal-fired plants, which churn out air pollution and carbon dioxide. Ask villagers here what they think of the proposed plant, though, and talk quickly turns to the Communist government’s dismal record of industrial accidents, as well as the 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan . Residents in Hubin will be resettled to new homes a few miles away, but many said that they would still feel threatened living so close to a nuclear station. “It’s just not safe,” said Liu Shimin, a farmer in her 20s, nursing a baby outside her home near the banks of the Yahe River. “We’ll always be wondering, ‘What if there’s a big accident, like that one in Japan?’ ” Such fears are on the rise in China as the nation embarks on a new phase of nuclear power construction that could make it the world’s biggest producer of nuclear energy by 2030. To meet its goals, analysts say, China must add six to eight reactor units — a plant usually has several — every year over the coming decade, most likely including its first in inland provinces like Henan and neighboring Hubei. China’s authoritarian government, adept at corralling public opinion to get its way, can ram through its plans over the objections of people like Ms. Liu. But opponents say its closed, secretive political system is ill equipped to manage a rapid expansion of nuclear power, pointing to its struggle to prevent industrial disasters such as the chemical explosions in Tianjin in August that killed 173 people . “The Chinese are beginning to wrestle with the same issues that Western countries were dealing with, concerning fear of the technology, transparency in decision making and trust of the authorities,” said Mark Hibbs , an expert on nuclear issues at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who follows China. To the government and many energy experts, China faces a choice: Build more nuclear plants, despite the public opposition and safety risks, or continue to rely on coal and accept the pollution and greenhouse gases that go with it. Without expanding nuclear power, they say, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for President Xi Jinping to fulfill his pledge to stop China’s carbon emissions from growing by 2030 — a commitment made in a landmark climate change agreement with President Obama last year. Mr. Xi also pledged that so-called clean energy sources would account for 20 percent of China’s total energy production by then. “A lot is at stake here,” Mr. Hibbs said. “If the Chinese don’t get it right, their entire plans for shifting the electricity generation system toward noncarbon sources would come under considerable stress.” China already operates 30 nuclear power reactors , mostly along its east coast, accounting for 2.4 percent of national electricity consumption. Twenty-one additional plants are under construction, and the World Nuclear Association counts 135 proposed reactors under serious consideration. By 2030, officials want nuclear power to generate up to 10 percent of China’s electricity. Even if all goes as planned, coal will continue to dominate the energy supply in China. But proponents of the government’s approach say serious cuts to coal use are possible if enough nuclear plants provide a steady alternate source of electricity. “Low-carbon development would be much harder to achieve if we ruled out nuclear power,” said Zhou Dadi, a professor at the state Energy Research Institute in Beijing, which advises policy makers. Since starting up its first power reactor in 1991, China has repeatedly wrestled with the pace and scale of its nuclear ambitions. Plans for a nuclear plant in Hubin Village, for example, go back over a decade, part of a rush of proposals for inland plants put forward after 2000. But a corruption scandal in the nuclear sector in 2009 forced a pause, and after the Fukushima meltdown in 2011, Beijing suspended construction on all nuclear plants, introduced new safety rules and effectively froze plans for inland reactors until the end of 2015. Now, officials and engineers who support nuclear power have been lobbying for construction of inland plants to resume as part of China’s next five-year growth plan, which begins in 2016. The Chinese Academy of Engineering , a government advisory body, submitted two reports to policy makers this year arguing that greater use of nuclear energy, including from reactors built inland, would help reduce the air pollution that is choking Chinese cities. Pollution from coal causes up to 1.2 million premature deaths a year in China. transcript 00136 00:10:41-00:10:46 When it’s windy it’s very polluted.

We have a nice environment.   00300 00:08:52-00:08:57 Salaries used to be $80-90 per month. Now they are around $800-900.   Qian Fuxiang used to live in the countryside, but his employer Datong Coal Company relocated him to Hengan New District, known to locals here ironically, as “Shanty Town.”   The 1700 gleaming apartment buildings began rising in 2008 to house 300,000 miners and their families, as well as those displaced by the growing mines.   00300 00:04:36-00:04:38 We don’t burn coal for daily life here. It’s not allowed. 00:04:38-00:04:41 So there’s no pollution.   Moving workers and their families from rural areas plagued by coal dust to a pop-up city has put pollution out of sight, and in the hopes of officials, out of mind. The free houses didn’t hurt either.   00301 00:00:34-00:00:43  00:00:34-00:00:43 It didn’t matter if you had a house or not, now basically every family has a house.   80 percent of China’s electricity is generated by coal-fueled power plants. Despite this, China’s President Xi Jinping has publicly pledged to wean the country from its coal binge. But you won’t see much support for that here, where locals see coal as their future, highlighting the great divide in China’s dedication to curb emissions.   Here in the Tashan Industrial Zone, Datong Coal Company has plans for 11 more mines, on top of the many dozens they already operate.   00318 00:05:46-00:05:55 This zone uses two mines, which produce 10 millions tons of coal.   The Tashan mine is heralded as a beacon for clean coal production, a show-and-tell stop for pro-coal politicians.  Officials point to environmental enhancements in how coal is brought out of the ground.   00319 00;08:39-00:08:46 The three wastes: materials, gas and water get fully recycled here. 00:08:48-00:08:49 You can say the ecological benefit is quite obvious. 00:08:49-00:08:53 You can see this from the environmental conditions in our zone. 00:08:53-00:09:00 You won’t see coal from the outside, although we’re producing coal. This is  outstanding.   Although the group has reduced industrial waste in the coal mining process, a deeper look into the Datong Coal Company shows 71 other mines in the area that don’t follow this model.   And a cleaner process to pull coal from the ground can’t mitigate the real environmental cost, when it’s burned.  Many locals here say the state owned mines are so politically and economically powerful, that government regulations are selectively enforced.   0322 00:04:17-00:04:21 I don’think the city government has any control over the Datong Coal Mine Company. 00:04:21-00:04:23   Wang Ximing used to work for Datong Coal Company but quit after an accident killed a colleague. Now he drives a cab, dodging coal trucks on the roads above the mines.  (I added the killed colleague bit back in because he references it below)  Mr. Wang has learned a lot listening to conversations in his backseat. He says coal companies like Datong will go at great lengths to avoid bad press about their industry.  He once drove local journalists to an accident.   0322 00:05:38-00:05:45 There was a flooding accident at Xinwang coal mine. Some local journalists from Shanxi went to check it out. 00:05:45-00:05:52 The mine reported that there was two or three men who had died in a flooding accident. 00:05:52-00:05:54 But there were more than two or three people. 00:05:54-00:05:58 Datong Coal Mine Company led the two journalists aside and gave them money. 00:05:58-00:06:03 The journalists accepted the money and then didn’t report the news. They didn’t do any interviews.  But even Mr. Wang who has seen some of the worst the mining industry has to offer is quick to take handouts from the company.   00321 00321 00:00:38-00:00:41 Our house got demolished and we received four apartments. 00:00:41-00:00:44 Now life is good. We became rich in one night.   00321 00:04:59-00:05:03 After my friend died, I stopped working underground and stayed above ground. 00:05:09-00:05:11 But they still pay me even I don’t go work there now. 00:05:11-00:05:15 They pay me 4000 RMB per month.   While mine owners paint a rosy picture in and around the residential developments and the model mines, many rural residents share little of the spoils.  00136 00:18:23-00:18:26 Our lands were destroyed, blown up for mining. 00:18:26-00:18:31 There are stones everywhere. You cannot grow crops on it anymore.   Wang Yongxiang lives next to an open pit coal mine 2 hours from Shanty Town.   00:11:27-00:11:37 Ten years ago they dug into the ground for coal, now there’s coal everywhere. 00:11:37-00:11:45 When there’s wind, especially when trucks pass by, there is coal dust everywhere. 00:11:45-00:11:48 The air looks very black. 00:11:48-00:11:53 But who can we complain to about this?     00136 00:05:36-00:05:39 (sigh) This is not a solvable problem. 00:05:39-00:05:48 Our leaders in the county allow them to mine for coal. 00:05:48-00:05:53 We don’t have a place to complain, so we just let it be polluted. 00:05:53-00:05:58 If you did a health check for our villagers here, most of them would have lung disease. 00:05:58-00:06:02 This place is polluted the whole year, during all four seasons.   Mr Wang has lost his income, food source and is plagued by coal dust. But while his livelihood has been destroyed, he has no choice but to accept the industry and its  impact on his environment.  And with an average of 1 new coal power plant coming online every 10 days for the next 10 years, President Xi’s notion to reduce coal consumption seems hollow, and for many unwanted.   And according to U.S. government projections, China will add the equivalent of a new 600-megawatt coal plant every 10 days for the next 10 years. http://www.climatecentral.org/blogs/chinas-growing-coal-use-is-worlds-growing-problem-16999    00136 00:22:39-00:22:50 We all think that they can excavate the mountain for a few more years, if they keep doing it. 00:22:50-00:22:52 But if they stop excavating the mountain and we’ve lost our lands, 00:22:52-00:22:57 we won’t even have jobs. We won’t be able to survive. 00:22:57-00:23:01 All the lands are destroyed. If you want to work you’ll have to leave the village. 00:23:01-00:23:07 But if they keep excavating the mountain we can still get jobs here. We won’t have to move to the city. Up to now, China has built its reactors close to the coast, where water needed for cooling systems is plentiful and there are big cities nearby hungry for power. But the next phase is almost certain to push inland, and that has become a chief focus for opponents of the nuclear program. They argue that limited water supplies and poor radiation dispersal make the proposed inland sites more dangerous, and that the sites are more densely populated than places where reactors have been built away from the coast in countries like the United States. They worry especially about the risk of radiation leaking into China’s biggest river, the Yangtze. “If there’s an accident, the environmental impact from an inland nuclear station will be far more serious than one on the coast,” said He Zuoxiu, a prominent retired physicist who is China’s most vocal opponent of nuclear energy. “Imagine if the Fukushima accident had happened on the course of the Yangtze River. Then how many people would have their food and water contaminated?” Proponents of nuclear power in China say the proposed inland sites need technology not very different from those on the coast, and that the new reactors will be much safer than older models. They also argue that China’s nuclear safety administration is more effective than other regulators in the country, especially since the Fukushima disaster prompted Beijing to devote more resources to it. “After Fukushima, they have thought about the lessons learned,” said Gavin Liu, president of Asia for Westinghouse Electric Company , whose AP1000 reactor is a cornerstone of China’s nuclear plan. He added, “I think we’re going to see more a robust and reliable nuclear construction program going to happen here.” Opponents of nuclear power in China maintain that the country can achieve its clean energy goals without a nuclear building spree, by investing heavily in improving solar and wind power and by upgrading the power grid so it can send electricity more efficiently across vast distances. They point to the deadly explosions in Tianjin, where hazardous chemicals appear to have been stored improperly at a facility close to residential areas, as an example of how of lax regulation, graft and official obfuscation can undo the Chinese government’s promises to put safety first. “Those searing lessons must never be played out in a nuclear reactor accident,” Wang Yinan, a researcher at a government think tank and influential critic of the nuclear plans, told the Chinese magazine Caixin last month . “For our political stability, economic development and social order, that would be a weight too heavy to bear.” Studies indicate that many Chinese would oppose a nuclear plant near their homes, but support nuclear energy in principle. That support, though, reflects the government’s ability to control information and discourage debate, said Arthur Mol , an environmental policy professor at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. Xuehua Zhang , a Chinese environmental policy researcher who has questioned plans to build more nuclear plants, especially inland, said, “Public participation in this decision-making process of whether and where to build nuclear power plants is extremely important.” Ning Li, dean of the School of Energy Research at Xiamen University in China, who supports greater use of atomic energy, said “not in my backyard” protests were on the rise. “So far, it hasn’t risen to the level of stopping nuclear, but in some areas it is slowing it down,” he said. In July 2013, officials in southern China curtailed plans for a nuclear fuel fabrication plant after hundreds of residents protested in a nearby town . That episode “sent a shock wave” through China’s nuclear establishment, which had assumed its plans could be insulated from public opposition, said Rob Forrest, a physicist who studied China’s nuclear program while at Stanford University. In Hubin, the authorities have sought to reassure residents by taking representatives to visit a nuclear plant in Zhejiang Province in eastern China. “We have to believe that the government is doing this because it must and can keep us safe,” said Mr. Wang, the retired village official. Other villagers expressed a mix of resignation and worry. Residents in Nanyang, a city of 1.5 million about 20 miles to the south, have also voiced alarm on the Internet and called for the project to be scuttled. “Here and around Nanyang, there’s opposition, but that’s futile,” said Li Chaoyong, 50, who builds and repairs homes around Hubin. “But if there are problems again like in Japan ...” His voice trailed off, and he shook his head.",2015-11-22T00:31:03.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

After a decade with few ground-breakings for large electricity generating stations, utilities in some regions anticipate a need for new capacity and are turning toward small plants built by independent suppliers. The growing demand for electricity has resulted in a renewed debate about where supplies should be obtained and about whether nuclear plants, which are always large, are a cost-effective alternative to smaller, nonnuclear plants. The nuclear industry and its critics have been trading contradictory numbers recently. A recent study commissioned by the nuclear industry contends that plants that look terribly expensive because of cost overruns are likely in the long run to make electricity more cheaply than plants that require oil. The study contends that the price of power from a nuclear plant will not rise over the plant's lifetime, while the cost of power from an oil-fired plant will rise gradually because of oil shortages and general inflation. The study is part of a continuing effort by the industry to build a case for renewed nuclear plant construction. It assumes that operating reliability will be better than the historical average and that the amount of additional capital investment required for the plant will decline year by year. Other experts say those assumptions are overly optimistic. A Case for Nuclear Plants The report was commissioned by the United States Council for Energy Awareness, the nuclear industry's main trade association, and written by Science Concepts Inc., which is based in Washington. The report projects that even if the price of oil increases only at the rate of general inflation, additional nuclear power plants could be justified economically if construction costs were brought under control. The report also assumes that 70 percent to 80 percent of a nuclear plant's cost is in the price of initial construction, a contention that is not accepted by all experts. The Science Concepts study relies on projections. But a recent report by another organization, based on recent operating experience, indicates nuclear plants have lost much of the operating cost advantage they enjoyed. How Costs Compared The Utility Data Institute, a nonprofit information company based in Washington, examined operating costs for nuclear plants that ran from 1982 through 1986. It found that their average cost per megawatt-hour of power had risen 42.7 percent over that period, from $14.16 to $20.20. Even at $20.20, the nuclear plants still had some advantage over coal-fired plants, whose operating cost was $21.67 in 1986, a decline of 3.7 percent since 1982. Oil-fired plants' production costs fell by an even greater amount, 37.1 percent, to $33.94. The new report prepared for the nuclear group asserts that ''even the most expensive nuclear plants built to date, which came on line between 1984 and 1987, are competitive with oil at about $20 per barrel if oil prices remain constant in real terms (that is, rising only with a projected rate of inflation at 4 percent).'' If prices rise as the Department of Energy projects, the study said, the plants will become a better bargain. Frank H. Lennox, one of the authors, said that with a 5 percent inflation factor, if oil prices rise slightly faster than the general inflation rate, as expected by the Energy Department, then oil would sell for $64.40 a barrel at the turn of the century, which would equal $34 in current dollars. That would be about double the current price. The study assumes that new nuclear plants will operate 65 percent of the hours in a year, which is about five percentage points better than the average of American nuclear plants last year. It also assumes relatively small additional capital investments for the plants of $10 million a year beginning in the 10th year. Critics question both those assumptions. Charles Komanoff, an energy analyst, said that the average 1,000-megawatt nuclear plant was spending $60 million a year for capital additions, apart from maintenance and fuel expenses. The study by Science Concepts notes that the average cost of building the 30 plants completed between 1984 and 1987 was $2,400 per kilowatt of capacity. In predicting that additional plants were feasible, it said plants could be built for $1,500 per kilowatt. But some plants not yet in commercial service will cost more than $5,000 per kilowatt.",1988-03-22T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business

The officials warned that small amounts of radioactive material were likely to leak from the plants. The power plants, known as Daiichi and Daini and operated by Tokyo Electric Power, experienced critical failures of the cooling systems after the plants were shut down, as they were during the quake. About 45,000 people were affected by the evacuation order at the Daiichi plant, where those living within a six-mile radius were told to leave. The evacuation of the second plant was for a one-mile radius because “there is no sign that radiation has been emitted outside,” an official said. Failure of the cooling systems allowed pressure to build up beyond the design capacity of the reactors. Small amounts of radioactive vapor were expected to be released into the atmosphere to prevent damage to the containment systems, safety officials said. They said that the levels of radiation were not large enough to threaten the health of people outside the plants, and that the evacuations had been ordered as a precaution. Nuclear safety officials focused initially on the Daiichi plant. But by Saturday morning Japan had declared states of emergency for five reactors at the two plants, an escalation that added to worries about the safety of nuclear facilities in the quake-prone Japanese islands. The Daiichi and Daini plants are 10 miles apart in Fukushima Prefecture, about 150 miles north of Tokyo and close to the quake’s epicenter off the coast. The plants’ problems were described as serious but were far short of a catastrophic emergency like the partial core meltdown that occurred at the Three Mile Island plant near Harrisburg, Pa., in 1979. A Japanese nuclear safety panel said the radiation levels were 1,000 times above normal in a reactor control room at the Daiichi plant. Some radioactive material had also seeped outside, with radiation levels near the main gate measured at eight times normal, NHK, Japan’s public broadcaster, quoted nuclear safety officials as saying. The safety officials said there was “no immediate health hazard” to residents from the leaks, which they described as “minute,” and people were urged to stay calm. The emergency at the Daiichi plant began shortly after the earthquake struck on Friday afternoon. Emergency diesel generators, which had kicked in to run the reactor’s cooling system after the electrical power grid failed, shut down about an hour after the earthquake. There was speculation that the tsunami knocked the generators out of service. Twenty hours later, the plant was operating in a battery-controlled cooling mode. Tokyo Electric said that by Saturday morning it had installed a mobile generator at Daiichi to ensure that the cooling system would continue operating even after reserve battery power was depleted. Even so, the company said it was considering a “controlled containment venting” in order to avoid an “uncontrolled rupture and damage” to the containment unit. “With evacuation in place and the oceanbound wind, we can ensure the safety,” a nuclear safety official, Yukio Edano, said at a news conference early Saturday. It was not clear, however, how long the cooling systems could continue to function in emergency mode or when normal power supplies could be restored. Two workers were reported missing at the Daiichi plant, but the company did not explain what might have happened to them. A pump run by steam, designed to function in the absence of electricity, was adding water to the reactor vessel, and as that water boiled off, it was being released. Such water is usually only slightly radioactive, according to nuclear experts. As long as the fuel stays covered by water, it will remain intact, and the bulk of the radioactive material will stay inside. If the fuel is exposed, it can result in a meltdown. The reactors at the two plants shut down when the earthquake began at 2:46 p.m. Friday. At the Daiichi plant’s Reactor Unit 1, when the emergency generators shut down, pressure began to rise in the reactor, leading operators to vent it. During much of the early morning on Saturday, safety officials focused on getting emergency power supplies to the Daiichi plant to restore the normal cooling function. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, speaking in Washington, said that American military planes had already delivered “coolant.” But American military officials indicated that while they were prepared to help Japan grapple with any problems related to its nuclear facilities, they had not been asked to do so. Japan relies heavily on nuclear power, which generates just over one-third of the country’s electricity. Its plants are designed to withstand earthquakes, which are common, but experts have long expressed concerns about safety standards, particularly if major quake hit close to a reactor. One major concern is that while plant operators can quickly shut down a nuclear reactor, they cannot allow the cooling systems to stop working. Even after the plant’s chain reaction is stopped, its fuel rods produce about six percent as much heat as they do when the plant is running. The production of heat drops off sharply in the following hours, but continued cooling is needed or the water will boil away and the fuel will melt, releasing the uranium fragments inside. 19 Photos View Slide Show › Heat from the nuclear fuel rods must be removed by water in a cooling system, but that requires power to run the pumps, align the valves in the pipes and run the instruments. The plant requires a continuous supply of electricity even after the reactor stops generating power. With the steam-driven pump in operation, pressure valves on the reactor vessel would open automatically as pressure rose too high, or could be opened by operators. “It’s not like they have a breach; there’s no broken pipe venting steam,” said Margaret E. Harding, a nuclear safety consultant who managed a team at General Electric, the reactors’ designer, that analyzed pressure buildup in reactor containments. “You’re getting pops of release valves for minutes, not hours, that take pressure back down.” Civilian power reactors are designed with emergency diesel generators to assure the ability to continue cooling even during a blackout. Many reactors have two, assuring redundancy; some have three, so that if one must be taken out of service for maintenance, the plant can still keep running. It was not immediately clear how many diesel generators there are at Daiichi, but the operators reported earlier in the day that they were not working, prompting the evacuation. Daiichi, which is formally known as Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, was designed by General Electric and entered commercial service in 1971. It was probably equipped to function for some hours without emergency diesel generators, said David Lochbaum, who worked at three American reactor complexes that use G.E. technology. Mr. Lochbaum, who also worked as an instructor for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on G.E. reactors, said that such reactors were equipped to ride out interruptions in electrical power by using pumps that could be powered by steam, which would still be available in case of electric power failure. Valves can be opened by motors that run off batteries, he said. Plants as old as Fukushima Daiichi 1 generally have batteries that are large enough to operate for four hours, he said. After that, he said, the heat production in the core is still substantial but has been reduced. The heat would boil away the cooling water, raising pressure in the reactor vessel, until automatic relief valves opened to let out some of the steam. Then the valves would close and the pressure would start building again. If the cooling system remains inoperative for many hours, the water will eventually boil away, he said, and the fuel will begin to melt. That is what happened at Three Mile Island. In that case, the causes were mechanical failure, operator error and poor design, according to government investigators.",2011-03-11T18:46:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

While there is good reason to be pleased with lower oil prices, two critical aspects of the global oil situation have been given short shrift. First, a major reason for the problems of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is that many non-oil-producing nations decided a decade ago to build nuclear power plants to replace oil. Last year, the world got almost as much energy from nuclear power as was produced by North Sea and Mexican oil fields combined. Nuclear power has caused a permanent loss of six million barrels a day of oil for OPEC - or put another way, it has meant that some oil-importing nations have been able to avoid purchasing over $50 billion a year in oil imports in just one year. Enough nuclear plants are in the ''pipeline'' to replace $15 billion a year more in oil imports. That we should keep encouraging this trend is evident when one considers that, despite the oil-production glut, the world really is consuming a nonreplenishable resource. In the period 1955-64, the world added three times as much oil to reserves as was consumed. From 1965 to 1974, world reserves increased by twice as much as total consumption. But from 1975 to 1984, when the incentive to find oil was unprecedented because prices were at an all-time high, the world, for the first time, consumed twice as much oil as was added to total reserves! These lessons are well recognized by our allies as they press forward with the complementary goals of increased efficiency and increased nuclear-power production. Here in the United States, as we watch our nuclear energy industry fade away, we seem to have absorbed only half the lesson. SULLIVAN S. MARSDEN JR.

Gioia as chairman of the Public Service Commission, and administration officials said his likely replacement was Peter A. Bradford, the chairman of Maine's Public Utilities Commission and a sometime critic of the nuclear-power industry. Mr. Cuomo's action - which would be the first time in half a century that a Governor has removed a P.S.C. chairman - comes after a year in which Mr. Gioia and Mr. Cuomo have increasingly been at odds, with the administration filing or contemplating lawsuits to overturn at least three of the commission's rulings. 'I Respect Him' And it comes in a year in which the spiraling cost of nuclear power plants and who would pay for them have become one of the most hotly debated political issues. Mr. Cuomo argues that the panel has favored utilities over consumers. In particular, he has challenged findings that would allow billions of dollars in construction costs for two new nuclear power plants, Shoreham and Nine Mile Point 2, to be passed on to ratepayers. ''I don't agree with his judgment or policies on Shoreham and Nine Mile Point 2 and a whole array of things,'' the Governor said. ''Paul and I don't agree; it's as basic as that. I want to make clear that I respect him. There are a lot of people I know well that I don't agree with on everything. He happens to be one of them.'' A Powerful Chairman The seven-member Public Service Commission has sweeping regulatory powers, supervising overall operations and controlling rates and financing for all the state's electric, gas, steam, telephone, telegraph and water-works corporations. Although the chairman holds only one vote out of the seven, he is more powerful than the other commissioners because he controls the P.S.C. staff, deciding who will conduct investigations, which administrative judge will hear a case and how official orders to a utility will be worded. Reached at home last night, the 44-year-old Mr. Gioia, who was appointed in 1981 by Gov. Hugh L. Carey, said that ''I think that what I have done at the P.S.C. was in the public interest.'' Asked if he was bitter, Mr. Gioia said, ''No, not at all.'' He declined further comment. Mr. Gioia's term on the commission officially expires next Feb. 1, and he will continue to serve on the panel until then, though not as chairman. Nominations to the commission require confirmation by the State Senate, but the Governor is free to designate any of the seven commissioners to the $83,407-a-year chairmanship without the consent of the Senate. Commissioners serve six-year terms. In addition to being at odds with the Governor over electricity rates and over who should pay for the nuclear power plants, administration officials said Mr. Gioia had also privately challenged the Governor on two bills that Mr. Cuomo pushed through the Legislature this year. One would set up a public power authority to take over the Long Island Lighting Company and the other would prohibit the cost of the Shoreham nuclear power plant from being passed on to ratepayers if the plant does not go into operation by the end of 1988. Administration officials said Mr. Gioia argued that both measures were illegal and possibly unconstitutional. ''The P.S.C. has been drifting and I think there's a great deal of dissatisfaction with its ability,'' said Richard M. Kessel, the executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board and the Governor's representative before the P.S.C. 'A Political Move' But Dale M. Volker, a Depew Republican and the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, called the Governor's action ''a political move in an election year.'' ''If he was going to remove Gioia, he should have done it a long time ago,'' the Senator said. ''Generally, I think Paul has done a good job. I think he has tried to be consumer oriented, but the problem is that you've got a very difficult situation with Nine Mile 2 and Shoreham. It's a political as well as a practical problem.'' Governor Cuomo, asked why he did not act sooner, said he had wanted time to watch Mr. Gioia in action and study how he handled such matters as Shoreham. Mr. Cuomo said that he had also been waiting for an opening on the commission and that he now had one with the resignation of Rosemary S. Pooler, who is running for Congress. As of Feb. 1, the terms of three other commissioners, including Mr. Gioia, will expire. Repeatedly, Mr. Cuomo declined to say who he would name as chairman. But administration officials confirmed that he planned to nominate the 44-year-old Mr. Bradford. He did not return telephone calls yesterday. 'Core of Zealots' A graduate of Yale University and Yale Law School, Mr. Bradford worked in the 1960's with the consumer advocate Ralph Nader and was appointed to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by President Jimmy Carter in 1977. In 1982, he became chairman of Maine's Public Utilities Commission. During his tenure on the panel, it ordered three Maine utilities, which owned 9.7 percent of the Seabrook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire, to find buyers for their holdings and get out because of skyrocketing costs for construction of the plant. In a 1985 interview with The New York Times, Mr. Bradford dismissed criticism by utilities that he was ''anti-nuclear.'' ''There is within the nuclear power industry a core of zealots who have defined as anti-nuclear anyone who doesn't want nuclear power on their terms,'' he said. ''I like to think of myself as anti-pro-nuclear.''",1986-08-02T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,metropolitan-desk-new-york

If the plan is approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, it will resolve years of uncertainty over the future of Shoreham, which has already cost more than $5.5 billion to build and maintain. Completed in 1984 and never operated except in low-level tests, the plant has been idle since Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, concerned that there was no way to evacuate the area, fashioned an agreement to shut it down. ""This represents a historic milestone in Long Island's history,"" said Richard M. Kessel, the authority's chairman. ""This will be a road map that will allow us to formally decontaminate and decommission the plant."" The dismantling, or decommissioning, of Shoreham would also represent the first time that a major nuclear power plant in the United States had been completed and then closed before opening. Mr. Kessel said that Shoreham's decommissioning plan could be a guide for other plants. 2 Years to Complete Under the plan, which would be paid for by Long Island residents and take a little more than two years to complete, the plant's reactor vessel would be removed and broken up, the fuel transported out, and all contaminated areas scrubbed and cleaned. The low-level waste, including the reactor vessel pieces, would then have to be buried, if a place could be found to dispose of it. Several things could be done with the spent uranium fuel, which is now sitting in fuel rods under gallons of water inside the plant, said Stanley Klimberg, executive director of the power authority. Three options are sending it to another utility, shipping it to a reprocessing plant in Europe or storing it at the Shoreham site until someone is willing to accept it. But it is becoming increasingly hard to find a state willing to accept out-of-state low-level radioactive waste, said Gregory C. Minor, vice president of MHB Technical Associations, a nuclear and engineering consulting concern in San Jose, Ca. It is not clear what would happen to the plant building. Converting it to a natural gas plant or a terminal for a ferry to Connecticut are two possibilities -- but one thing is certain, Mr. Kessel said: the dismantling of Shoreham would be irrevocable. It could never operate as a nuclear plant again. Letters to N.R.C. The plan, which depends on approval by the power authority's board of directors, will be submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission next week, he said. The nuclear agency still has two other applications pending: one to modify Shoreham's license to reflect the fact that it is not operating, and one to formally transfer ownership from the Long Island Lighting Company, which built the plant, to the power authority, which bought it for $1 with the intention of closing it. In the last few months, the Bush Administration has sent several letters to the N.R.C., asking that any decision on Shoreham's demise be put off until the Middle East situation is resolved.",1990-12-21T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region
5be4e900-ba81-45cd-b64e-c870dcb9c745,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/business/energy-environment/22NUKE.html,Edging Back to Nuclear Power,"FOR the first time since the 1970s, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has announced a step that it once took routinely: appointing an inspector for a new reactor construction project. With 17 applications in hand from companies that want to build 26 reactors, the agency is likely to name a lot more inspectors; it also expects five more applicants in the next few years. Is this the long-awaited renaissance of the nuclear construction business, after years of being moribund? Certainly, some crucial ingredients are falling into place. Nuclear power provides 70 percent of the nation’s carbon-free electricity, important at a time when environmentalists track carbon in the atmosphere the way baby boomers check their cholesterol levels. And while Congress has not agreed on setting a price on carbon emissions, important people say we need more low-carbon power. President Obama said in his State of the Union address that it was time to build “a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country,” and his budget plan would triple the pool of loan guarantees available for construction, to $57.5 billion. Near Augusta, Ga., where the Southern Company opened its Vogtle 1 and 2 reactors in 1987 and 1989, workers have cleared away storage sheds and are preparing a site for construction of units 3 and 4. Vogtle received the first loan guarantees, $8.3 billion, under a program enacted in 2005; the five years that have passed are an indication of the pace of the renaissance. Yet, undeniably, there is progress. Parts have been ordered from as far away as Italy and Japan, and there are stirrings in the supply chain here, suggesting that, while the United States can no longer manufacture all the key components, it can at least contribute to a global system. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has approved the Vogtle site, and a legion of its engineers and those at Westinghouse, the designer, are hashing out details before a new kind of license can be issued — one that will allow cookie-cutter copies of the reactor around the country. Generic approvals for other designs are at various stages. Boosters of nuclear power want to repeat the 1970s, with dozens of orders a year; Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, has called for building 100 plants, which would more than double existing capacity, just as the United States did from 1970 to 1990. And there appears to be bipartisan support for new reactors. Some longtime opponents, like Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said they still do not like the technology but would hold their noses and take a package that included some of what they want. Mr. Markey, who with Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, wrote the climate bill that passed the House last year, has been an implacable critic of the industry for decades. But if support for new reactors is the price of getting Senate agreement to a carbon cap, he said in an interview, he would negotiate over that. Representative John Hall, a Democrat from the Hudson Valley of New York, was a popular musician in the 1970s in the band Orleans and starred, with Jackson Browne, Graham Nash and Bonnie Raitt, in a series of concerts at Madison Square Garden that raised $1 million to oppose nuclear power. He still dislikes the technology but has cast votes to help the industry, in bills that also contained subsidies for renewable energy. “The unfortunate truth, speaking as somebody who is skeptical of nuclear power, is that we probably need to do everything, and we probably need to do it fast,” he said. Unlike the 1970s, when nuclear power’s role was to reduce oil consumption, now there is some ambiguity. What new reactors would mostly replace is coal and some natural gas. These have both been cheap lately, while nuclear power has a cost both certain to be high and hard to predict precisely. The newer justification for nuclear power is preventing climate change, but the industry may have hitched itself to an untested imperative. “They say, ‘You know, we’ve really got to save the planet, and this is the panacea for supplying tons of power, 24/7, to address climate change forever,’ ” said Barry Moline, executive director of the Florida Municipal Electric Association, a coalition of public power agencies based in Tallahassee. “That’s what the industry has been hanging its hat on, but the climate debate has been floundering.” A mild summer, a cold winter, some leaked e-mail messages and some evident errors in climate change reports have created doubts, justifiable or not, about the urgency of controlling carbon emissions, he said. With the setbacks in his state and elsewhere, if there is a nuclear renaissance “it’s going to be a crawl instead of a run,” he said. Meanwhile, the recession has cut the demand for electricity for two years running, reducing the need to build anything at all. And in what might be a more worrisome development for the industry, even the continued operation of some existing reactors is not assured. In Vermont, the State Senate voted overwhelmingly to close a 38-year-old reactor, Vermont Yankee, and would have to reverse itself to allow operation beyond 2012. It took the vote even though the plant is crucial to the state’s ability to meet its carbon-dioxide goals under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, sort of a mini-Kyoto agreement. In New York, another signatory to the regional agreement, the Department of Environmental Conservation, may be doing the same thing at Indian Point, complaining that the cooling system sucks in fish and fish eggs from the Hudson River. An environmental group is using the same argument to try to close four reactors in California. Thus the existing reactors, potential models for expansion, are beginning to look like heirlooms, vintage technology from the age of slide rules, eight-track tapes and moon landings. At Vermont Yankee, an old wooden cooling tower collapsed in 2007, not threatening the plant’s ability to shut down safely, but looking just awful. After leaks of radioactive water were found at an Illinois plant, the whole industry went looking for similar leaks and Vermont Yankee found them. The leaks do not appear to have produced any detectable dose of radiation, but plant officials had wrongly assured the state that they had no buried pipes that could leak. While Vermont Yankee demonstrates the ability of a single plant to squander public trust, it also demonstrates the emergence of the states in nuclear regulation. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 gave primacy to the federal government. But when members of the Vermont Senate voted to decline to provide a new “certificate of public good,” a requirement for any power plant, they argued that the plant could not be reliable beyond its initial 40-year operating period. The plant, though, has been running more than 500 days without a shutdown. Underlying public attitudes about nuclear power is, if not fear, at least lingering anxiety. This is the industry that gave American English the all-purpose term for disaster, from the financial markets to a toddler’s tantrum: meltdown. The recent deaths of 29 coal miners in West Virginia, of six construction workers at a natural gas plant in Connecticut in February and of five maintenance workers at a hydroelectric plant in Colorado in October 2007 have not shaken the popular conception that it is nuclear power that is dangerous. This seems to be true even as the meltdown at Three Mile Island in 1979, before many Americans living today were born, fades into memory. “The nuclear industry is just so far removed from people’s lives, they don’t have much feeling for it,” said Baruch Fischhoff, a professor of social and decision sciences at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. “They don’t really trust it. Although it hasn’t done anything recently to lose the general public’s trust, it hasn’t done anything to gain people’s trust.” Lately, he said, the industry has “fewer enemies, but no friends.” But if friends are not appearing, at least tolerance is evident. A Gallup poll in March showed that 62 percent of Americans, a new high, favor the use of nuclear power. “There’s more public acceptance of nuclear power today than there has been at any time in my professional career,” said Alan Hanson, a 30-year industry veteran now with the American subsidiary of Areva, the French reactor maker. He added, though, “you can’t buy a nuclear reactor with public acceptance.” Mr. Hanson’s company sells a reactor that several American companies would like to build, and one company, Unistar, is in line to get federal loan guarantees to help pay for it. But Unistar, a joint venture of Électricité de France, the French national electric company, and Constellation Energy, the parent company of Baltimore Gas and Electric, has not actually committed to build the plant. Among the elements of such calculations are whether Congress will pass legislation on carbon-dioxide emissions, which would help their project by handicapping the competition; the overall demand for power; and the price of natural gas, which is always volatile but has been especially low lately, partly because new drilling techniques have raised the amount of gas believed to be available. One symptom of the national ambivalence about nuclear power is that American industry no longer has the ability to build 100 reactors itself; the American steel industry no longer has the capacity to build the biggest parts, the reactor vessels. These giant pots are about 40 feet high and 12 feet in diameter. In existing reactors, they were formed by casting flat steel plates eight inches thick, then bending them into curves, and then welding the plates together into rings. The rings were then stacked to form a cylinder; a top and bottom were attached and the product, running into the hundreds of tons, shipped by barge to a reactor site. But the welds turned out to be vulnerable to damage over time, as neutrons, the subatomic particles that maintain the chain reaction, strayed out of the core and hit the metal, slowly making it brittle. And inspecting the welds is extremely cumbersome. So the reactor operators, in a wish list compiled 20 years ago, said that if they ever bought new vessels, they’d like them without many welds. As a result, the new vessels are cast in rings, but American steel mills can’t make those. Given enough time and the promise of enough demand, they could gear up to do so, but the industry was dormant for so long that it hardly noticed that the new requirements exceeded its abilities. Most such parts come from Japan Steel Works, which takes 600-ton steel ingots and presses them like Play Doh into the appropriate shape. It recently installed its second press and planned to be able to build 12 reactor vessels a year. For an American company to do the same would require an enormous capital investment. “I don’t know why anybody would,” said David M. Ratcliffe, the chief executive of Southern, who said it would not be worth the effort unless the market looked a lot bigger than it did right now. In a sign of the new energy landscape, ArcelorMittal, the company that owns Lukens Steel, which built most of the reactor vessels for existing American plants, has been in talks with Westinghouse over a different part of that company’s new design, for the type of reactor that is planned for Vogtle. The design calls for stacking 13-foot wide steel strips laid out like stripes on an American flag, to build a dome 130 feet high. The steel strips are a bit wider than ArcelorMittal can handle, and the talks are over whether the part can be redesigned. The company could invest in its factories to make wider plates, or even vessels, but it is not sure the market is there. “We’re not really sure where this is going,” said Shelby Pixley, chief executive of ArcelorMittal USA Plate. The company also makes steel towers for wind machines, Mr. Pixley said, and he said he believed that business would continue to grow, but “at this point we’re not really sure what the winner is going to be at the end.”",2010-04-22T07:05:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

Three months after the Long Island Lighting Company gave final approval to the sale of its $5.5 billion Shoreham nuclear power plant to New York State, the reactor has been stripped of its uranium fuel rods and its staff has been reduced by more than a fourth. But that is as far as the matter has gone, at least publicly. Beyond heated objections over the settlement by its opponents, little has been said about the state's plans to decommission the reactor. The trouble, officials involved in the continuing negotiations suggest, is that now that the state has achieved its political goal of closing the plant, it lacks the expertise to tear it down or to convert it to use another fuel. Decommissioning Plan Awaited Before the plant can be transferred to the state, however, the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission wants to see a technical decommissioning plan. ''Lilco can't transfer the plant until there is somebody ready to accept it,'' Thomas E. Murley, director of the commission's Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, said after a meeting last month with Lilco officials. Under the settlement between Lilco and New York, the Long Island Power Authority, a state agency created to take over Lilco, is to own the plant and oversee its decommissioning. State officials acknowledge, however, that the authority is a political creation, with no technical expertise to oversee and own a nuclear plant. The settlement anticipated the problem. One provision stipulates that the Long Island authority hire the New York Power Authority, a sister agency, as a contractor to oversee Shoreham and put together a decommissioning plan. The New York authority owns and operates two nuclear plants: the James A. Fitzpatrick plant in Oswego and Indian Point Three in Buchanan. Political Battle Continues For the last three months, officials of the two power authorities and Lilco have been negotiating several agreements that they must sign before the state can approach the Federal nuclear commission with its plans for Shoreham. In addition, the Long Island authority has begun to hire consultants to put together the technical expertise. In the meantime, the political furor over the plant has continued. Top officials of the Bush Administration have argued that the plant should not be closed. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has traveled to Washington to try to persuade President Bush to withdraw Federal opposition to closing the plant. Given the controversy, it would seem that officials would be eager to move ahead with the next phase, Shoreham's decommissioning. Yet, publicly at least, they express satisfaction with the pace of the talks between the power authorities and Lilco. The latest goal is to complete those agreements by November and apply to the nuclear commission by the end of the year. Pace of Planning Defended ''We can't put together a whole license transfer and decommissioning plan overnight,'' said Richard M. Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority and executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board. ''We will meet with the Federal Government when we are ready and willing,'' he said. A Lilco vice president, Joseph W. McDonnell, said the utility and the power authorities were making ''steady progress.'' ''We recognize that it is a complex transaction, and we also recognize that it will come under scrutiny from the Federal Government and from other interveners,'' he said. ''While we definitely would like to make an application as soon as possible, it may take time for the state to enter into those contracts and make them firm.'' Lilco completed Shoreham in 1985, but was unable to win a commercial operating license because of the unwillingness of the state and Suffolk County to participate in emergency planning. By the time the proceedings on emergency planning ended this year, with the nuclear commission granting Lilco a full-power license, the utility had agreed to sell the plant to New York State for $1. In return it is to raise its electricity rates to customers 5 percent a year for 10 years. Customers to Pay Since its shareholders gave final approval to the settlement in June, Lilco has moved aggressively to reduce its costs at Shoreham. It expects to save about $43 million this year. But utility officials have cautioned that they can take no further steps until the state decides how to proceed. Those talks, state and utility officials said, have been further delayed by concern about the financing of the decommissioning. Under the settlement, Lilco is to charge its customers for the costs of the decommissioning by including them in its electric rates. It then is to reimburse the New York Power Authority for its expenses. The utility is apparently concerned that the costs be as low as possible. ''Lilco does not want the New York Power Authority to be given a blank check,'' said one official with knowledge of the discussions. ''It wants to assure that the decommissioning plan is a least-cost plan.''",1989-10-12T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,metropolitan-desk

In their considerations, however, the utilities are looking very carefully at the troubled licensing history of the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station. The $4.5 billion plant, they say, will serve as an object lesson of what to avoid in the future, regardless of whether Shoreham ever gains a Federal commercial operating license. In a series of interviews, the officials also sought to put some distance between Shoreham and the rest of the nuclear industry by describing some of the problems that plagued the Shoreham project as unique and unlikely to recur. ''Shoreham is certainly not typical of what's going on in the nuclear industry,'' said Scott W. Peters, the media services manager for the Atomic Industrial Forum, a nuclear industry group based in Washington. ''There aren't many places where you would build a nuclear power plant that would be on an island in a heavily populated area.'' In addition to its North Shore site -which, along with rising electricity rates, has provoked the strongest opposition to the plant - Shoreham was also said by utility spokesmen to be the victim of changing Federal regulations that required costly refitting of plant systems. New regulations and technical requirements that proliferated after the Three Mile Island reactor accident in Pennsylvania in 1979 hit Shoreham especially hard, the industry spokesmen said. They said that the regulations, which were intended to enhance safety features of nuclear plants, had created regulatory uncertainties that played a role in the cessation of orders for such plants. No American utility has filed an application to build a nuclear plant since 1978, according to the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission. But nuclear industry officials say that a new generation of plant applications may be expected within the next five years if demand for electricity continues to expand at the 4 to 5 percent annual rate of the last two years after more than a decade of minimal or no increases. First, however, the industry will want broad changes in Federal regulations and licensing - changes prompted in part by the Shoreham licensing case. John J. Kearney, the senior vice president of the Edison Electric Institute, an association of utilities, said that the Shoreham case showed it is ''foolhardy'' for any utility to construct a nuclear plant and then risk Federal rejection of a license to operate it. Suffolk County and New York State, which oppose the Federal licensing of Shoreham, have argued that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission cannot properly issue a license because Lilco lacks legal authority to implement an emergency preparedness plan for the plant. Such a plan is required by post-Three Mile Island regulations. Two Nuclear Regulatory panels, citing court decisions, have also found that Lilco lacks authority to implement the plan. Under current regulations, the commission may not issue the Shoreham license until there is a tested and approved emergency plan to protect residents around the plant. However, the Feb. 13 Federally ordered drill of the Lilco emergency plan for Shoreham specifically deleted parts of the plan that a State Supreme Court justice held would involve Lilco's illegally assuming governmental functions. While many Suffolk officials believe that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will approve the Lilco plan and issue a license for Shoreham by this summer, they also believe that the issue of legal authority will be the basis for overturning the commission's decision in Federal court. ''Everything has boiled down to a single issue: whether Lilco has the authority to implement its plan,'' said Herbert H. Brown, an attorney representing Suffolk in the Shoreham case. Industry spokesmen said they seek regulatory changes that would remove the possibility of such challenges to completed nuclear plants. ''The current licensing and regulatory procedures of the commission are perceived by the electric utility industry as uncertain and unpredictable,'' said Mr. Kearney of the Edison Electric Institute. ''Shoreham is an example of that.'' The industry is lobbying for Congressional action on several pending bills that provide for utilities' receiving full approval for nuclear plant construction and operation before ground is broken. The project would then be required only to meet Federal specifications agreed upon in advance. ''The Shoreham licensing has been every utility's nightmare,'' said Richard H. Bornemann, a Washington lobbyist for the American Nuclear Energy Council, which represents utilities with nuclear power plants. He said the council is promoting bills that would standardize nuclear plant design and then provide for Federal approval of the designs. Utilities that wish to build nuclear plants could then select a design that already had Federal approval, he said. Such standardization has marked the nuclear industries in France and Japan. Mr. Bornemann said he expected Senate action on one standardization bill this spring. ''No utility is going to take the nuclear trip again without the promise of regulatory stability,'' he said. He and others said utilities were also mindful of the $1.39 billion in the $4.5 billion of Shoreham costs that the New York State Public Service Commission ruled last year Lilco may not collect from ratepayers because of company mismanagement of the Shoreham project. The penalty, the largest ever imposed on a utility, suggests a course of action for utility regulators in other states. ''It shows that utilities will have to get their ducks in a row as far as construction is concerned,'' said Mr. Peters of the American Industrial Forum. ''They have to make sure the plants are constructed as safely and quickly and cheaply as possible.'' Howard Shapiro, the director and general counsel of the Energy Association of New York State, which represents utilities in the state, said no New York utility had plans to propose new nuclear plants. ''But the industry has not by any means discounted the nuclear option,'' he said. Utilities would be more diligent in gauging public and political opposition to nuclear plants before embarking on nuclear plant proposals, he said, as a result of the Shoreham controversy. Mr. Shapiro has been at odds with the State Energy Office, which has said that no large nuclear plants will be needed in the state for the balance of the century. Industry spokesmen noted that Shoreham and other nuclear plants proposed in the late 1960's had fallen victim to an unforeseen and radical drop in demand for electricity caused in large measure by the Arab oil embargo. By 1974, the 7 percent annual growth rate in use of electricty that had prevailed in much of the country, and that had prompted power plant construction, had been sharply reduced as inflated energy prices led to energy conservation among consumers. Lilco's generating plants are powered by imported oil, and the company was particularly affected by higher oil prices. New plants projected to meet future demand suddenly represented excess capacity, and inflation also pushed construction costs higher while new Federal regulations compelled costly refitting. In the aftermath of the Feb. 13 emergency drill, Lilco officials are sounding optimistic about the prospects for Shoreham's licensing despite state and county opposition. ''If local opposition were to be successful, no nuclear plant in any state would be free from such a situation,'' said the Lilco vice president of public affairs, Lynne Abraham. ''If Shoreham isn't allowed to operate after being completed and certified safe by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, it certainly would have a chilling effect on all nuclear power development.'' She said that capital-intensive nuclear plant construction projects would also be hard-pressed in the future to find investors if Shoreham is blocked. As for Lilco, Miss Abraham said, proposals for future nuclear plants were ''unlikely'' because of the opposition the Shoreham plant brought. The project also rendered Lilco the financially weakest of the state's utilities. ''We did it the hard way,'' Miss Abraham said. ''It's been a tough road.'' Opponents of the Shoreham plant believe the road will grow rougher still for the utility. ''While Lilco may think it achieved a success in holding the Feb. 13 drill, what the drill actually did was to solidify opposition to Shoreham on Long Island,'' said Gregory J. Blass, the Presiding Officer of the Suffolk County Legislature. Mr. Blass and other Shoreham opponents also thought Lilco's apparent progress toward gaining a Federal operating license for the plant would expedite state legislation to replace the company with a public power authority. ''The takeover proposal has momentum like never before,'' he said. The centerpiece of the proposal is that the Shoreham plant would not be allowed to operate.",1986-03-16T06:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,long-island-weekly-desk-new-york-long-island

The Administration's action pitted the Justice Department against the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, an agency the department usually defends. The commission recently rejected the Administration's arguments and granted a license that cleared the way for the eventual dismantling of Shoreham. In papers filed at the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, the Justice Department sought to stay the granting of that license. In doing so it called for an environmental review, a legal tool more commonly associated with environmentalists trying to stop development or protect land. The Justice Department argues that such a review would include a study of the environmental implications of using alternative power sources, like fossil fuel, instead of nuclear power. Dormant From the Start The Government has been arguing for several years that Shoreham, a $5.5 billion plant that was fully built but never allowed to operate, was a crucial part of the country's nuclear power program and that it should not be shut down. The action yesterday was one of the strongest the Administration has taken to try to save the plant. At the very least, the Administration hopes to delay Shoreham's dismantling so that it may someday be allowed to operate as a nuclear plant. New York State officials have vowed that that would never happen. The Administration is seeking to stay a recent ruling by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that would change Shoreham's operating license into a ""possession only"" license. Such a license would allow the plant's owner, the Long Island Lighting Company, to transfer ownership to New York State, which intends to tear down the plant. It hopes to do so beginning this fall. Shoreham's supporters hope that if the Justice Department obtains a stay on the possession-only license, the plant could one day open. But like everything associated with Shoreham, it would take a long time. First, a stay would delay the matter until a trial was held on the merits of the license. In the best-case scenario for Shoreham's supporters, then, the courts would order that a full environmental impact study be done on the plan to decommission, or dismantle, Shoreham. A study would then find that dismantling the plant would cause more harm than good, and that could pave the way for the plant's operation. ""The best substantive result would be if the environmental study served to inform the public and the decision-makers of the absurdity of Governor Cuomo's proposal to decommission Shoreham, and results in an order from the N.R.C. denying the application,"" said James P. McGranery, a lawyer representing Shoreham supporters. The Department of Energy has argued that the reactor is safe and that its operation would help the national goal of reducing dependence on foreign oil. The department had previously appealed to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, unsuccessfully, to block the license change. The filing, made at the request of the department, came as a result of peculiarities in the Atomic Energy Act. Under that act, lawsuits on nuclear matters go directly to the Appeals Court and must be filed against both the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is an independent agency, and the Federal Government as a whole. The Justice Department generally acts as the lawyer for the Government. At Odds With an Old Ally A spokeswoman at the Justice Department, Amy Casner, acknowledged that its arguments in its legal papers run counter to the position of the Justice Department's usual ally, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ""Our legal opinion is they should have done an environmental impact statement,"" Ms. Casner said. In going to court yesterday, the Administration joined two groups of Shoreham supporters, the Shoreham-Wading River Central School District and a group called Scientists and Engineers for Secure Energy Inc. Together they argue that under the National Environmental Policy Act, an action like the dismantling of a nuclear plant requires an environmental analysis. Their memorandum filed in court says, ""It is clear that the approval of the possession-only license is likely to result in actions being taken at the plant which could render moot a meaningful consideration of alternatives to decommissioning or limit the methods of decommissioning available to the NRC."" The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has previously concluded that no such environmental analysis is needed. Mr. McGranery, the lawyer for the school district and the scientists, called the filing ""very encouraging"" and said it would greatly bolster his case. New York State officials, who fought Shoreham for years on the ground that it could not be evacuated safely, responded with dismay to the Justice Department's filing, saying it would only delay the plant's inevitable shutdown. In Albany, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo called the department's action unfortunate. Delaying the demolition, he said, would ""cost Long Island's consumers millions of dollars."" ""The decision to close Shoreham is irrevocable,"" Mr. Cuomo said. ""Shoreham is never going to operate as a nuclear power plant,"" said Richard M. Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, the state agency charged with the dismantling. ""All this will do, if it is successful, is further delay the decommissioning and raise the rates for the customers. The Justice Department should have better things to do than to continue to harass Long Island on an issue that should be dead."" The 809-megawatt plant, on a rural road in the village of Shoreham in Suffolk County, was completed in 1984 and successfully generated power in low-level testing. But political pressures overtook it, and it was never allowed to operate. In 1989, after years of wrangling with New York State over the plant's future, Lilco agreed to sell Shoreham to the state for $1 so that the state could dismantle it. But the transfer agreement has been bogged down in Washington for the last two years as supporters of nuclear energy, including the Department of Energy, have been arguing before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that Shoreham should remain open.",1991-07-12T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

The letter praising Nora Bredes [ July 3 ] for killing the Shoreham nuclear power plant is indicative of how the emotionally ignorant, the doomsday agitators and their opportunistic politicians are out to terrorize and mislead the public and destroy American technology. This country developed safe nuclear energy and made it into a major source of power for the generation of electricity and for propulsion of our Navy. All of this accomplished without one recorded death or injury to any member of the public, a 100 percent safety record. In stark contrast, coal, oil, and gas fossil fuel plants kill between 50,000 to 125,000 people each year from emitting sulfides and toxins in the air as well as from fires and explosions. The acid rain and greenhouse damage from these fossil fuel plants is well documented. Nuclear energy has none of these problems, plus it reduces our dependency on OPEC oil. The Three Mile Island accident, where there was no injury to human, animal or plant life, proved the safety of our nuclear plant design. The scare stories about radiation damage at Three Mile Island were farfetched; ''experts'' inflamed public fears by dealing recklessly with statistics. Since Three Mile Island, all of our plants have been made doubly safe. The new Shoreham plant is the safest-designed plant in the nation. It was clearly politics bending to the irrational negative influences in our society. This was more than proven by Governor Cuomo naming Nora Bredes to the Board of Trustees of the Long Island Power Authority. Since when do the qualifications for a high-level public job require no previous experience in that industry or in any public job, just that the applicant be an accomplished activist in that field? No wonder that competent, progressive people in other countries are leaping ahead of us and we are becoming a second-rate technical nation. The damage being done to Long Island and our nation by people like Nora Bredes and Governor Cuomo will hurt us for many years to come. LAN L.

But the Power Authority and the private company, Entergy Nuclear, which have signed a $967 million sale contract, said their goal was to protect the employees at the two plants: the Indian Point 3 reactor in Buchanan, in Westchester County, and the James A. FitzPatrick plant in Scriba, in Oswego County. The contract is subject to approval by the N.R.C. Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers Union of America, which represents unionized employees at the two plants, also filed a petition with the commission raising safety concerns about the transaction, which would be the largest sale of state assets in history. Westchester County and several local governments asked the commission to extend today's deadline for filing such petitions. The Power Authority wants to close the deal by October. Entergy, of Jackson, Miss., said its offer was good until the end of the year. The N.R.C. does not normally get involved in personnel or contract issues but has sometimes become concerned if labor relations are so poor that they threaten plant safety. The managers' group at the Power Authority, the Nuclear Generation Employees Association, represents nearly 400 employees at the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick reactors, and at offices in White Plains and Manhattan. The managers said Entergy would leave them vulnerable to layoffs and to reductions in pension and health benefits. Jack Murphy, a spokesman for the Power Authority, said of the petition: ''I think it's nonsense. Before we entertained any offer from anybody, including Entergy, one of the primary requirements was that our employees would go to the new company at the equal salary, and the same level of benefits.'' Carl Crawford, a spokesman for Entergy, said his company was negotiating with benefit providers to devise a package that matched what the employees have now. Mr. Crawford acknowledged that Entergy had told workers that benefits could be reduced after the first year, but he said that ''they could go up as well.'' He said Entergy planned ''no significant layoffs'' for a year after the deal closed. Joseph R. Egan, a lawyer representing the Nuclear Generation Employees Association, said he would file suit against the Power Authority in New York to clarify its obligations.",2000-07-19T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

But little has gone according to plan in this ambitious project, which is already more than four years behind schedule. Although envisioned as a big bet on Britain’s clean-energy future, the project has been bogged down in months of dickering between the British government and EDF Energy, the French state-controlled power company that is supposed to oversee construction and eventually operate the plant. EDF Energy, which already runs most of Britain’s aging fleet of nine nuclear power plants, is threatening to walk away unless the government guarantees a price for the electricity that is roughly double the current rate. With tens of billions of pounds and thousands of jobs riding on the deal, the issue might ultimately be decided at the highest reaches of the British and, possibly, French governments. “This isn’t a decision about the price for one power station,” said Dieter Helm, a professor of energy policy at the University of Oxford. “This is about whether we want a nuclear industry or don’t we. That is the question. Only the politicians can decide.” EDF executives declined to comment. Mark Malbas, a spokesman for Britain’s Energy and Climate Change Department, which is leading the talks, declined to discuss the negotiations in detail, other than to say that they were continuing and that the department was “focused on getting a fair deal for the consumer.” Britain had been counting on nuclear energy as a big part of meeting its commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by the mid-2020s. Planners originally called for five or so new nuclear plants to be up and running by 2025. But with even the first of those plants not yet under construction, the concern is that as Britain closes its older nuclear stations — which generate about 20 percent of the country’s electricity, at a very low cost — new ones will not replace them. “It will be a big setback for British energy policy if these negotiations break down,” said Tim Yeo, a Conservative who is chairman of the House of Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee. Britain’s nuclear ambitions already received a big setback last year , when two big German utilities, RWE and E.On, decided not to proceed with construction of a plant that had been planned for Wales. The companies cited the costs and the uncertainty of getting a return on their investment. The EDF plan calls for a plant with two nuclear reactors to be built on a headland called Hinkley Point overlooking the Severn Estuary in southwest England. Earthmovers have been carving away at a hillside there in recent months. If the green light is given, that soil will be trucked into the next valley as part of a gargantuan project that is expected to create 25,000 construction jobs. The site — 175 hectares, or about 430 acres — is just south of a 1970s-era nuclear station known as Hinkley Point B, which is operated by EDF. And looming over the fields are the eerie, boxy shells of two 1960s-era reactors that have been shut down for more than a decade but still employ a couple of hundred people in the decommissioning. EDF executives say they have already spent £1 billion, or about $1.5 billion, getting to the “shovel-ready” point for the reactors. After years of study, Britain’s nuclear and environmental regulators have approved designs, and about 70 percent of the necessary contracts are already lined up and ready to be signed. If and when the new plant, Hinkley Point C, comes fully online, it will supply about 7 percent of Britain’s electricity. That would be enough power to meet the needs of five million homes, with the added benefit of no carbon emissions. On Tuesday, Edward Davey, Britain’s energy and climate change minister, is expected to announce the final decision on whether Hinkley Point construction can begin. It would be a moot point, though, if EDF did not agree to proceed. The sticking point has been what electricity price the government will guarantee. It has vowed not to subsidize new nuclear power plants. But energy legislation now wending through Parliament includes a means to set a floor price for the electricity from the new plants, with customers covering the cost. With the price tag for the Hinkley Point plant estimated at £14 billion, or $21 billion, EDF is thought to be seeking a floor price of around £100 per megawatt-hour — about double the current rate for electricity in Britain. That is what EDF would need to earn the 10 percent return on investment that it is looking for, according to estimates by Harold Hutchinson, an analyst at Investec in London. The British government is thought to be pushing for something closer to an 8 percent rate of return. EDF Energy is already one of the biggest utility companies in Britain, and the former prime minister Tony Blair used to say that a French utility’s providing energy for his Downing Street office was proof of the openness of the British economy. But the current government might fear the political beating it would take if it were perceived to be guaranteeing high profits to a French company. Just how much the price supports would add to household electric bills is hard to gauge. The government has said that various new clean-energy measures to support nuclear energy, as well as wind and solar power, will add about 4 percent to the average household electric bill by 2020. EDF executives have complained that they are spending £1 million a day on a project that may never happen, which is why they are threatening to walk away if there is no deal by the end of the month. A few weeks ago, according to a person close to the negotiations, Vincent de Rivaz, the urbane Frenchman who heads EDF’s British branch, went to Downing Street to deliver this message to Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, Britain’s top civil servant. The government and EDF declined to comment. Both sides have a lot to lose if the talks fall apart. The main task of building the nuclear cores for the new power station will go to Areva, another state-controlled French company that is a world leader in designing and building nuclear plants and works closely with EDF. For those companies, Britain provides an opportunity to prove the mettle of a new generation of Areva-designed nuclear technology known as European pressurized water reactors, or E.P.R.’s. The Areva reactors would be extremely powerful, generating 1.6 gigawatts each — about one-third larger than the biggest of Britain’s current nuclear plants. But E.P.R.’s are also proving complex and expensive. The first two Areva E.P.R. plants, under construction at Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland, have been plagued by technical problems and huge cost overruns. Britain’s nuclear future may be hanging in the balance. When EDF first started planning for Hinkley Point in 2009, executives thought they would have the E.P.R.’s plugged into the grid by 2017. Now even 2021 looks optimistic. That is why Centrica, the British utility that was EDF’s 20 percent partner for the Hinkley project, has already walked away, taking a £200 million write-off. “The main consideration was cost and time scale,” said Greg Wood, a Centrica spokesman. “We are now looking at a project that isn’t going to generate first power until 2021 or probably 2022. We were asking our shareholders to provide capital for nine years before seeing any return whatsoever.”",2013-03-15T21:07:13.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

The attacks in Brussels last month were a stark reminder of the terrorists’ resolve, and of our continued vulnerabilities, including in an area of paramount concern: nuclear security. The attackers struck an airport and the subway, but some Belgian investigators believe they seemed to have fallen back on those targets because they felt the authorities closing in on them, and that their original plan may have been to strike a nuclear plant. A few months ago, during a raid in the apartment of a suspect linked to the November attacks in Paris, investigators found surveillance footage of a senior Belgian nuclear official. Belgian police are said to have connected two of the Brussels terrorists to that footage. Security at Belgium’s nuclear sites is notoriously poor. In August 2014, someone — as yet unidentified — drained 65,000 liters of lubricant from the turbine used to produce electricity at the country’s Doel 4 nuclear power plant. No penetration was detected, leading investigators to suspect an inside job. In 2012, two workers at the same plant reportedly left Belgium to fight in Syria, eventually joining the Islamic State. One of them is believed to have died in Syria; the other was convicted of terrorism-related crimes after returning to Belgium. Yet still too little is being done to secure nuclear plants. That goes not only for Belgium: Nuclear facilities throughout the world remain vulnerable. During the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington last week, more than 50 leaders announced that significant amounts of highly enriched uranium had been moved from various countries to secure storage sites and that a key nuclear-security treaty would be strengthened. But the improved version of that treaty is inadequate: It doesn’t even call for arming the guards who look after bomb-grade nuclear material. Discussions about nuclear terrorism also tend to focus on the risk of terrorists stealing weapons-grade material or making a dirty bomb. But they often overlook the danger of terrorists attacking a nuclear plant in order to set off a Chernobyl- or Fukushima-like disaster. That risk is real, however, and has been known for a while. The master planner of the 9/11 attacks had considered crashing a jumbo jet into a nuclear facility near New York City. A Qaeda training manual lists nuclear plants as among the best targets for spreading fear in the United States. Striking a nuclear plant or the cooling ponds in which nuclear waste is stored wouldn’t set off a mushroom cloud or kill hundreds of thousands of people. But it would spew large amounts of radiation, spark a mass panic and render vast swaths of land uninhabitable. And it could cause thousands of early deaths from cancer. More than one in three Americans lives within 50 miles of the 99 nuclear reactors operating in the United States today. There are more than 300 other nuclear reactors producing electricity in 30 other countries. Nuclear plants have built-in safety mechanisms, typically multiple systems that are unlikely to fail simultaneously: If one of them malfunctions, there’s always a backup, the theory goes. But redundancy is effective protection only against accidents, not against terrorists who set out to cause simultaneous system failures. For example, by targeting power and water supplies at the same time, attackers could cause a reactor to melt down or a cooling pond to ignite. After the catastrophe at Fukushima, safety measures were bolstered at nuclear plants worldwide: More emergency equipment was put on standby, and measures for venting explosive hydrogen gas were improved. But conspicuous gaps remain in security, even in countries like Japan, India, Pakistan, Russia and the United States, which have major nuclear facilities and also have suffered serious acts of terrorism in the past. President Vladimir V. Putin didn’t even attend last week’s summit. The first measure must be to combat complacency. Incredibly, it took the November attacks in Paris for Belgium to finally arm guards at its nuclear power plants. Even more incredibly, it took the Brussels attack last month for Belgian authorities to review the personnel records of employees at nuclear sites — and determine that about a dozen workers should have had their credentials revoked on security grounds. At a minimum, armed guards should be required at all sites that hold weapons-grade material or enough low-enriched fuel to cause a major release of radioactivity. And all employees at nuclear plants should be thoroughly vetted before they are employed. The United States can leverage its leadership in the international commerce of nuclear material and technology to improve security at nuclear plants in other countries. United States law already requires that nuclear material originating in that country be adequately protected when it is exported and while it is abroad. Washington could also require a credible assessment of local terrorist threats, protective measures like arming guards at host facilities, regular exercises simulating armed attacks to test the plants’ security systems, and independent oversight. Current United States laws and regulations prohibit American intelligence and policy officials from sharing classified assessments of terrorists’ intentions and capabilities with many governments. Even Japan, one of the world’s largest producers of nuclear power and a close United States ally, cannot access this information. That must change. And the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, a voluntary network of 86 states and five international organizations, can help build capacity in this area by encouraging its members to share intelligence and best security practices. Terrorists have their eyes on nuclear plants. So must we.",2016-04-04T15:48:53.000+02:00,NYTIMES,oped-opinion

The company, a division of Duke Energy, said that it was considering three reactor designs and that it would need a plant in 10 to 15 years to serve the Piedmont region of the Carolinas. But it also made clear that it was still considering exactly where and when it wanted to build. The company already operates coal, hydro and natural gas plants and could build one of those instead, but Bryan Dolan, manager of new nuclear projects at Duke, said, ''the numbers we have today tell us that nuclear will be very competitive.'' The company said that it was probably two years away from making a decision and would wait until May to decide whether to begin the multimillion-dollar task of preparing an application. But it said that it was starting analytical work on a nuclear plant because that type of plant would take the longest to build. Even that is new for the nuclear business. ''This is the most concrete discussion we've had on a new plant application for at least 20 years,'' Scott Burnell, spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said. No one is sure what it would take to license a new reactor, and most of the people at the commission and in the industry have little experience in the field. In fact, many Americans were not yet born when the last successful reactor order was placed. That was the Palo Verde plant, in Arizona, in late 1973. And there are still no substantial assurances that a new reactor will be ordered. But senior executives of companies that operate reactors say that nuclear power is starting to look more efficient as the cost involved with other plants rises. Natural gas, which powers most of the plants built in the last 10 years, has tripled in price and shows no signs of falling soon. While coal is available, no one is sure what the rules will be on emissions over the next few decades. But a crucial problem for nuclear plants is that building them requires estimating years in advance the level of demand and market price for power. Supporters of plants hope to build new ones in 5 years, although some of those now in operation took more than 10. One problem for builders is having to pay interest costs on a plant in which they have invested $1 billion or more. Beginning in the late 1980's, the commission tried to simplify the application process, announcing that it would take applications from utilities for preapproval of reactor sites, and from reactor vendors for preapproval of designs. The idea was that a utility could win approval for sites years in advance and ''bank'' them, then pick a completed, approved design and have a relatively quick hearing to determine if there was any reason a particular design would not go well on a given site. On Monday, Duke executives asked how long an application would take under various situations: if they picked an approved design for a new site or for a site where a reactor was already running, or if they chose a design that had not been approved. The commission has approved one design already, is working on a second and anticipates a third soon, but commission officials said they might not have the manpower to work simultaneously on approving an application and evaluating a new design.",2005-03-15T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business
53595fd7-d63d-482e-868d-8302cc605070,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/business/global/26nuke.html,Europe to Test Safety of Nuclear Reactors,"BRUSSELS — After a week of bickering over the future of nuclear power, European Union leaders reached one point of agreement Friday as they decided that reactors across all 27 member nations should undergo safety tests in response to the continuing radiation leaks from a beleaguered plant in Japan. The move — which came as Europe also remained split over action in Libya and as leaders struggled to calm markets with a plan to bolster the euro — was a rare note of accord on nuclear power. “We cannot simply pursue business as usual” after the disaster in Japan, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said at the end of a two-day summit meeting of E.U. heads of state and government in Brussels. The technology supplies about 30 percent of the Union’s electricity. But bitter divisions persist between countries like Austria, which banned nuclear energy in the late 1970s, and Britain, which is planning to build a new fleet of reactors to replace its aging models. The tests agreed to Friday are voluntary, but José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, said the tests should be conducted at all 143 reactors across the Union. Mr. Barroso also called for “comprehensive” tests on plants in neighboring countries like Switzerland. The tests represent only a modest step toward centralized oversight of nuclear energy facilities in Europe, where member states zealously guard control over their energy industries. But Mrs. Merkel insisted that the reviews “will be somewhat different from the safety tests we have had up until now.” The plan approved Friday calls for national regulators to conduct the tests on the basis of common criteria drafted with the European Commission. The leaders said national regulators would then make the results public. Each government would evaluate the results and make any decisions on shutdowns. The tests should assess threats from earthquakes, floods, airplane crashes and terrorists and examine the robustness of backup cooling systems, according to Günther Oettinger, the bloc’s energy commissioner. The tests should also assess the security of ponds where highly radioactive spent fuel is stored, Luis Echávarri, director general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Nuclear Energy Agency, said in an interview this week. After an earthquake and a tsunami knocked out backup power, setting off a crisis at the Fukushima plant north of Tokyo, advocates of nuclear power have stepped up efforts to portray Europe, where severe earthquakes are rare, as being relatively safe. But opponents have seized on an opportunity to highlight concerns about the vulnerability of Russian-designed reactors in Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, and to discourage the construction of a new reactor in Bulgaria. By backing the tests, Mrs. Merkel was partly seeking to assuage public concern ahead of a sensitive election on Sunday in the state of Baden-Württemberg, where there are a number of reactors. Germany gets about a quarter of its power from nuclear, but opposition to the technology is widespread, stoked by the accident at Chernobyl, in Ukraine, in 1986. Mrs. Merkel already has ordered a temporary halt of seven of the oldest reactors in Germany. That signaled a major shift by the chancellor, who had previously supported extending the lives of many of those reactors. Mrs. Merkel said at a news conference that “decommissioning and phasing out is one option, but there is also the modernization option” for reactors and plants that did not pass the tests. But analysts said Germany could be on the cusp of a more profound policy reversal If Mrs. Merkel’s party were to lose the election Sunday, said Mark C. Lewis, a managing director at Deutsche Bank, “this would be such a shock to Germany’s body politic that the legislation to extend the operating lives of Germany’s nuclear reactors passed last October would almost certainly face very material changes, and some or all of Germany’s 17 nuclear reactors an accelerated schedule for their permanent shutdown.” The so-called stress tests approved by the Union are also a delicate matter for France, the world’s second-biggest nuclear power producer after the United States. French officials want the tests to highlight how the reactors it manufactures — and that could become an important export — are the safest choice for nations choosing nuclear energy. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France suggested on Friday that what happened in Japan would not happen in landlocked countries and countries that had not experienced similar tsunamis in Europe. Even so, “were the tests to be failed or to be unsatisfactory we will take all necessary measures, which simply means shutting them down,” said Mr. Sarkozy, who added that all 58 reactors in France would be tested. Earlier in the week, in thinly veiled criticism of Germany, the French energy minister, Éric Besson, said shutting plants on the basis of their age was not suitable in France because other risks, like flooding, based on the location of a plant, were likely to be more significant. Mr. Besson also criticized Mr. Oettinger, and a member of the same political party in Germany as Mrs. Merkel, for warning of an imminent catastrophe in Japan last week. Opponents of nuclear power immediately complained that the tests will not be rigorous enough to lead to the closure of reactors that lack secondary containment, move spent fuel from vulnerable pools into dry storage, and halt plans for reactors in seismic regions. “These stress tests are designed to give the impression that there’s a new evaluation of the risks of nuclear power,” said Rebecca Harms, a German member of the European Parliament. “But politicians in France and Germany really want to use them to win new acceptance for nuclear power,” she said. In another sign of concern in Europe about events in Japan, E.U. food experts late on Thursday ordered random checks on food and animal feed imports for radioactive contamination.

Even with all the reactors offline in what is known as a cold shutdown, essential equipment to cool spent fuel rods needs a constant source of power. It is at least the fourth time the plant has lost its connection to outside power since Russian forces began occupying the facility early in the war. Each time, engineers have raced to make repairs before the diesel fuel ran out. International nuclear inspectors have called the situation unsustainable and precarious. Energoatom, the Ukrainian company that operates the plant, said in a statement that two recently repaired high-voltage power lines had been damaged by Russian shelling around 11 p.m. Wednesday and that the plant had gone into “full blackout mode.” There is enough fuel at the facility to power generators for 15 days, the company said. Russia deliberately severed the connection to the grid, Energoatom said, as part of their effort to redirect the energy generated by the plant through lines that run south toward Crimea, which Russia has illegally occupied since 2014 and is a critical supply link for Russian forces in Ukraine.",2022-11-03T09:32:13.000+01:00,NYTIMES,europe

The facility, which is near Middletown, Pa., has been losing money, and in a statement on Wednesday, Exelon Generation, the company that owns the plant, said it would be closed by Sept. 30. The company and its employees had been hoping for a subsidy from the state, and when that fell through, a shutdown was the only option, that statement said. “Today is a difficult day for our employees, who were hopeful that state policymakers would support valuing carbon-free nuclear energy the same way they value other forms of clean energy in time to save TMI from a premature closure,” Bryan Hanson, Exelon’s senior vice president and chief nuclear officer, said in the statement. A company spokesman said the cost of decommissioning the site was estimated at around $1.2 billion. The reactor where the accident occurred 40 years ago is not owned by Exelon, and it was dormant long before the company began operating a nearby reactor around two decades ago. But for many residents of the area around Harrisburg, Pa., the words “Three Mile Island” will always evoke memories of that panic. It was, as The New York Times reported in the aftermath, “an accident that would generate a week of doomsday fear, panicky flight, conflicting statements, noisy demonstrations and intense confusion.” Disaster struck in the early morning hours of March 28, 1979, when water-coolant pumps failed and a reactor overheated. The temperature kept rising after a stuck valve misled the operators into stopping the flow of emergency cooling water. There was a partial meltdown, and the plant was in crisis for several days. Radiation was purposefully released into the air to relieve pressure within the system. Public panic was fueled, in part, by the sense that people weren’t getting enough information about what had happened — and what they should do to stay safe. No immediate deaths or injuries were reported, and studies suggest that long-term physical health effects from the accident have been negligible, though this has been contested. What is clear is that the accident spurred sweeping safety regulations. The damaged reactor on Three Mile Island was never restarted. Nuclear plants often face opposition from environmentalists, as well as from representatives of competing industries like natural gas. But some Pennsylvania residents, including the nearly 700 workers at the facility, were not happy about the pending closure. “I think it’s a sad moment for all,” said Richard Drey, the business manager for a local chapter of an electric workers’ union, which represents about 200 people who work at the facility. “We thought there was still hope in keeping the place open. It’s going to have a devastating effect on some of the families.” (Exelon said it would offer jobs to workers who were willing to relocate.) The plant on Three Mile Island, which sits in the Susquehanna River in Londonderry Township in central Pennsylvania, has been struggling financially for years. Exelon announced as early as 2017 that it would close down the plant “absent needed policy reforms.” Supporters of nuclear energy went after those reforms: Two bills were introduced in the State Legislature that would have steered about $500 million to clean power producers in Pennsylvania, with nuclear plants as the main beneficiaries. That might have kept Three Mile Island open, but no action was taken on the measures. Accidents like the one at Three Mile Island make it difficult for nuclear power facilities to present themselves as clean and safe, even though they do not generate planet-warming greenhouse gases. And cheap natural gas from hydraulic fracturing has forced some American nuclear reactors to cease operations. With these closures comes a new problem: What to do with all of the hazardous waste? “Nobody believes an island is a suitable site to store radioactive waste,” said Eric Epstein, the chairman of Three Mile Island Alert, a nuclear watchdog group based in Harrisburg, Pa., that was founded two years before the 1979 accident. He said the cleanup efforts on the island should be prioritized, which could bring employment opportunities to people losing their jobs. “This is not a time for celebration,” he said. “It’s a time for a reality check. When it comes to nuclear, and cleaning up plants, we’re entering a really long and challenging phase.” According to the World Nuclear Association , a London-based group that promotes nuclear power, there are 98 operating nuclear reactors in the United States. Last year, they accounted for 20 percent of the country’s total electricity output. In Pennsylvania, there are four other power plants operating outside of Three Mile Island. After the shutdown on Three Mile Island, fuel — the radioactive material generating heat inside of the nuclear reactor — will be moved into a pool of water. A few years after that, the fuel will be moved into dry storage, where it could stay indefinitely or until the federal government takes ownership of the material. The facility itself will be given decades to cool down, until it is safe for people to dismantle the structures. Exelon estimates that the plan to dismantle large components won’t begin until 2074.",2019-05-09T07:17:49.000+02:00,NYTIMES,express-u.s.

The reservation evidently reflected unsettled disputes over compensation arising from the accident last April at the Chernobyl power station in the Ukraine that showered radiation over muc of Eastern and Western Europe. The two conventions, which were prompted by the Chernobyl disaster, were signed by 50 governments at a conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna on Sept. 26. One pact requires early notification of leakage of radioactive materials from civilian installations. The other calls for prompt emergency assistance from other nations. Soviet Reservation Is Added At the signing, a Soviet Deputy Prime Minister, Boris E. Shcherbina, said, ''The Soviet Union declares it will comply with both conventions.'' In reporting ratification on Friday, however, the Government press agency Tass said the Soviet Union would not consider itself bound by articles on the compulsory submission of disputes. Tass said the Soviet Union held that both sides in a dispute had to agree before seeking outside arbitration. When the conventions were drafted in July, governments disagreed on the issue of compensation. Some countries insisted on making the polluter legally liable for damages. Several Western European countries have demanded compensation for losses caused by the Chernobyl accident. ENTOMBMENT IS COMPLETED MOSCOW, Nov. 15 (Reuters) - The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said today that the permanent entombment of the No. 4 reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant had been completed. The paper said that a jacket of steel and concrete 200 feet high had been erected around the reactor, one of four at the station. Remote-controlled equipment was used for much of the work because of radiation from the damaged reactor. A fire and explosion at the reactor on April 26 has resulted in the death of 31 people, mainly from radiation disease, and has led to the evacuation of 135,000 people from a circular zone with a radius of 30 kilometers (18 miles) around the power plant. The accident led to the dismissal of high-level administrators of the nuclear power industry, and the creation of a separate Ministry of Nuclear Power. Previously nuclear stations were administered by the Ministry of Electric Power, which was in charge of most of the electricity generation in the Soviet Union. The first two reactors, which were shut down at the time of the accident, have been brought back into service, and the third is undergoing repairs. Plans are going ahead to build a fifth and sixth reactor at the plant. Power station workers and their families have been temporarily housed in the cities of Kiev and Chernigov. Work crews are working on a tour-of-duty system, with two weeks on and two weeks off. While on duty, the power station workers are now being housed in the temporary settlement of Zeleny Mys, on the west shore of the Kiev reservoir on the Dnieper River, outside the evacuation zone. Plans have been announced for the construction of a new permanent city of 30,000 population for power station personnel and their families. The site selected for the new town is the village of Nedanchichi, in Chernigov Province, on the left bank of the Dnieper River. The new town will replace the power-station city of Pripyat, which was evacuated after the accident and is now a ghost town.",1986-11-16T06:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world

Mr. Kan’s was the most closely watched testimony in the six-month inquiry, which was started by lawmakers who felt an earlier internal investigation by the government had papered over problems. Mr. Kan used the appearance to criticize the relatively pronuclear stance of the current prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, who replaced him in August. Mr. Noda has called for restarting Japan’s undamaged nuclear plants, which have all been idled since the accident because of public safety concerns. He says the plants are needed to avoid economically crippling power shortages. Mr. Noda has met stiff resistance from many Japanese voters, who say the government is rushing to restart the plants without proving that they are safe or allowing time for a proper public dialogue over whether Japan actually needs nuclear power. In his testimony, Mr. Kan said that Japan’s plant safety was inadequate because energy policy had been hijacked by the “nuclear village” — a term for the power companies and pronuclear regulators and researchers that worked closely together to promote the industry. He said the only way to break their grip was to form a new regulatory agency staffed with true outsiders, like American and European experts. “Gorbachev said in his memoirs that the Chernobyl accident exposed the sicknesses of the Soviet system,” Mr. Kan said, referring to the 1986 explosion of a reactor in Ukraine, which spewed radiation across a wide swath of Europe. “The Fukushima accident did the same for Japan.” Since resigning from office last August, Mr. Kan has kept a low profile. Despite the pointed comments, it seems unlikely that he is trying to stage a political comeback, given the widely shared perception here that his government bungled its response to the accident, covering up the true extent of the danger. Rather, he seemed to be trying to improve his own tarnished legacy. Mr. Kan spent much of his three-hour testimony fending off criticisms of his handling of the accident, which covered a wide area in northeastern Japan with radiation. He complained that nuclear regulators and the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power, or Tepco, kept him in the dark about crucial details in the days immediately after a huge earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011, knocked out cooling systems at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, causing three of the plant’s reactors to melt down. He said he tried to be fully open with the public and hid nothing. But he seemed to undermine that claim when he disclosed that in the early days of the crisis he feared it could spiral out of control, even as his own ministers were giving public reassurances that they had the plant under control. He said he feared additional meltdowns could “release into the air and sea many times, no, many dozens of times, many hundreds of times the radiation released by Chernobyl.” Those fears led to the most extraordinary moment of the crisis, when Mr. Kan walked into Tepco’s headquarters after being told the company wanted to evacuate its staff from the crippled plant. He demanded that they stay, saying he was prepared to put his own life on the line to prevent the disaster from worsening. He also defended his visit to the plant on the day after the earthquake, which has been widely criticized for distracting plant personnel at a crucial juncture in their efforts to save the overheating reactors. Mr. Kan told the panel that he wanted to get an assessment directly from the plant manager because he felt Tepco officials in Tokyo were not giving him enough information. But his strongest comments came at the end of his testimony, when a panel member asked if he had any advice for the current prime minister. Mr. Kan replied that the accident had brought Japan to the brink of evacuating metropolitan Tokyo and its 30 million residents, and that the loss of the capital would have paralyzed the national government, leading to “a collapse of the nation’s ability to function.” He said the prospect of losing Tokyo made him realize that nuclear power was just too risky, that the consequences of an accident too large for Japan to accept. “It is impossible to ensure safety sufficiently to prevent the risk of a national collapse,” Mr. Kan said. “Experiencing the accident convinced me that the best way to make nuclear plants safe is not to rely on them, but rather to get rid of them.” However, Mr. Noda apparently did not the heed the warning. Hours later, the prime minister indicated that he may soon make a decision on restarting the Oi nuclear plant in western Japan, which he hopes will be a first step toward turning on Japan’s other idled plants.",2012-05-28T18:53:51.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The company cited “regulatory uncertainty” after a change in Florida’s rules that cast doubt on whether a utility can collect money from customers for construction work before a project is finished. The decision comes at a time of low prices for natural gas, which competes with nuclear power in electricity generation, and generally slack demand for power. The project was started by Progress Energy in 2008, and was acquired by Duke when it merged with Progress last year. Duke said it would continue pursuing a license to build and operate the plant, but drop the contracts for completing the engineering work, acquiring components and building the reactors. “Duke Energy Florida continues to regard the Levy site as a viable option for future nuclear energy generation, and understands the importance of fuel diversity in creating a sustainable energy future,” the company said in a statement. By 2018, Duke will probably have to build a plant running on natural gas to meet demand, according to Alex Glenn, the president of Duke Energy in Florida. The announcement is a setback for the “nuclear renaissance” that the industry predicted a decade ago. Other than the reactors under construction, two each in Georgia and South Carolina, it is not clear how many projects will be started. Similar to the Levy County project is a twin-unit plant that Florida Power & Light is planning at Turkey Point, near Miami. Duke was planning to build two new reactors at its Harris site, in Wake County, N.C., but suspended plans there earlier this year . The company is still seeking a license for a twin-unit plant in Cherokee County, S.C. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is processing other applications, but some clearly lack the backing to be built. At the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade association in Washington, Steve Kerekes, a spokesman, pointed out that in addition to the four new reactors under construction, the Tennessee Valley Authority is working to complete a fifth on which work was halted some years ago. “Everything else is prospective,’’ he said. The economy is growing only slowly, and “we’ve got electricity demand that’s still below ’07, nationally,’’ he said. “We’ve got low natural gas prices in the medium term, and all this stuff is regional and based on specific company needs.”  Another variable, he said, was whether federal policies on emissions of climate-changing gases from power plants encouraged new nuclear construction.",2013-08-02T02:18:19.000+02:00,NYTIMES,national-u.s.

To the Editor: Whether we like nuclear energy or not, the sad reality is that there are no other options open to us. Renewables like wind and solar energy are prohibitively expensive in capital cost, about $8,000 a kilowatt. Since wind does not blow and the sun doesn't shine all the time, there has to be a standby source of power for wind-solar lulls. The only non-emitting carbon dioxide energy source that can replace the grid provided by fossil fuel plants is nuclear reactors. The capital cost of nuclear reactors is a factor of 3 or more lower: around $2,000 a kilowatt. To replace present-day fossil fuel with nuclear reactors would cost around $1 trillion. Spread over 10 years, this becomes $100 billion a year. Compared with the cost of the Iraq war or tax cuts to the rich, surely this sum is within reach?

The action was taken immediately after an appeals board of the agency rejected a request by the Attorney General of Massachusetts for a delay in the license approval. In denying a stay, the appeals panel cited a similar case in which the full commission granted a fuel-loading license to the Shoreham nuclear power plant on Long Island in December 1984, despite opposition from local and state governments in New York. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, who had opposed the Seabrook permit, denounced the decision today as ''imprudent and unnecessary.'' Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti of Massachusetts, said the state would appeal the panel's decision against granting a delay to the full Nuclear Regulatory Commission and then, if necessary, to courts. But a top executive of the reactor operator called the decision ''the first step'' in the issuance of a long-term operating license for Seabrook and predicted that all appeals would fail. Edward A. Brown, president and chief executive officer of New Hampshire Yankee, the reactor operating company, told a news conference in Boston that the radioactive fuel, which Seabrook will begin loading next week, was safe. ''I could hold a bundle of it in my hand and know it would have no effect on me whatsoever,'' Mr. Brown said. ''Seabrook station is probably the safest nuclear power plant that has ever been built. There is no need to be concerned.'' The Seabrook plant, which lies 43 miles north of Boston near a popular stretch of New England coastline, has encountered bitter opposition from anti-nuclear activists, Massachusetts officials, and several towns in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. Opponents have questioned the adequacy of Seabrook's legally required emergency evacuation plan. The painstaking fuel-loading process at Seabrook will involve the insertion of thousands of small-diameter metal tubes containing radioactive material into the massive reactor vessel, a thick steel cylinder that will then become radioactive itself. The only action then necessary to obtain a full-power operating license would be to receive approval of an emergency evacuation plan from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which would have to certify its approval to the nuclear agency. Governor Dukakis, whose state falls within the 10-mile-radius emergency evacuation zone, has attempted to block such approval by refusing to participate in the emergency planning. A similar approach has been taken by local and state officials in New York in an effort to block the Shoreham plant. The fuel loading authorization at Seabrook, signed by Richard Vollmer, deputy director of the Federal agency's Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, gave the approval of the commission's technical staff to a step that would make key portions of the reactor permanently radioactive and thus make its ultimate closure technically difficult and extremely expensive. Jim Dorsey, a spokesman for Mr. Dukakis, said the Governor's judgment that the fuel-loading approval was wrong was based on his belief that ''it is very much in doubt whether the plant is ever going to be licensed for full operation.'' Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of a House subcommittee that oversees the nuclear agency, has been sharply critical of the issuance of fuel-loading permits to reactors that are opposed by their home governments and communities. He has called such approvals a step ''to ram a nuclear power plant down the throats of state and local authorities who have made it clear they do not want the plant to operate.'' $50 Million a Month The Public Service Company of New Hampshire, the principal owner of the reactor, has said the delay in gaining an approved evacuation plan has been adding $50 million a month to Seabrook's $4.9 billion construction cost, which is already plagued by cost overruns that nearly resulted in insolvency for the utility. Since the nuclear accident at the Three Mile Island power plant in Pennsylvania in 1979, the commission has required that emergency evacuation plans be prepared and tested for a 10-mile radius around all reactors. Under the ''pre-criticality testing'' portion of the permit issued today, the Public Service Company of New Hampshire is also authorized to conduct tests of reactor pumps and generator turbines using steam from a nonnuclear source, such as an oil-fueled auxiliary boiler. In June, after the nuclear accident at the Chernobyl reactor in the Soviet Union spread radioactivity over a wide area of Europe, Governor Dukakis, a Democrat seeking re-election, joined the doubters by declaring that it would be ''a grave mistake'' to start up the Seabrook reactor without an approved emergency evacuation plan. Six Massachusetts towns are within Seabrook's 10-mile emergency zone, and Gov. Dukakis' statement was sufficient to delay fuel-loading at Seabrook, which was originally scheduled for June. The issuance of a fuel-loading and testing permit for Seabrook followed the granting of a similar preliminary operating license to the Shoreham nuclear plant on Long Island, which also lacked an approved evacuation plan. Mr. Brown, the New Hampshire Yankee president, said that the fuel loading permit granted today was ''certainly not the last hurdle, but it is the biggest milestone we've passed yet.''

This town was the birthplace of atomic energy in Japan -- site of the country's first research reactor and first commercial nuclear power plant -- but in the future it might be remembered more as a place where Japan's nuclear ambitions took a severe blow. A fire and explosion here at the country's only nuclear waste reprocessing plant have raised public concern about the safety of atomic power and cast a cloud over Japan's already controversial program to harness deadly plutonium as a source of energy. The incident, on March 11, has been classified as the worst nuclear accident in the nation's history. Some 37 workers were exposed to radiation, although it was far below levels that would be harmful, the plant's managers said. Some radioactive materials, including plutonium, escaped into the atmosphere and were detected as far as 23 miles away, though at levels that the Government insisted posed no danger. But some experts say it is worrisome that any radiation leaked at all. ''I think the accident is technically very serious even if it's not environmentally serious,'' said Atsuyuki Suzuki, professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Tokyo. A seeming comedy of errors in responding to the fire and informing the public was more disturbing to some than the amount of radiation released. The missteps were committed by the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation, a Government-run company that also was in charge of an experimental reactor at which a serious accident occurred in December 1995. Japan is banking heavily on conventional uranium-based nuclear power and on advanced systems using plutonium to relieve its almost complete dependence on imported oil and coal. Plutonium can be extracted from the spent fuel of nuclear power plants and then used as fuel itself, either in conventional reactors or in fast breeder reactors, which can create more plutonium than they consume. The plant in Tokai, a Pacific coast town 70 miles northeast of Tokyo, handles about 12 percent of Japan's spent fuel, with the rest sent to France or Britain for reprocessing. The Tokai plant and the adjacent plutonium fuel fabrication factory now contain about 4.4 tons of plutonium, which is toxic and in some forms can be used to make nuclear warheads. Even before the latest accident, Japan's plan was facing a cloudy future because of the December 1995 leak of sodium coolant at the country's prototype fast breeder reactor, known as Monju. No date has been set for reactivating Monju, which has been closed since the accident. The Government-run nuclear energy company was harshly criticized for its slow response to the Monju accident and for its attempts to cover it up. The company's top executive was replaced, safety manuals were revised and other reforms were supposedly introduced. But many of the same types of mistakes were made in the Tokai accident. The sprinkler system to put out the fire was left on for only one minute. It is believed that failure to extinguish the blaze completely led to the subsequent explosion. Containment systems did not function effectively, so that radiation from the room with the fire leaked into an adjacent building, exposing workers, who were not evacuated until 24 minutes after the fire was noticed. Although the nuclear energy company reported the initial fire quickly to local governments, it took hours to report that radiation had leaked, and then continually revised upward the amount of leakage and the number of workers exposed. People in Tokai did not know of the explosion, which took place about 8 P.M., until the next morning, in part because the local government withheld the news. Furthermore, several officials in the department in charge of repairs at Tokai took part in a golf tournament on the day of the accident and subsequent days as well. ''The lessons from Monju were not learned,'' conceded Junichi Kurakami, a spokesman for the Tokai works. ''My own mother was asking, 'What's going on with your company?' '' The fire started shortly after 10 A.M. in a chamber in which low-level liquid waste from the plutonium extraction process is mixed with asphalt and poured into metal drums for eventual disposal. The waste is so dangerous that people are not allowed in the chamber and all of the work is done by remote-controlled machines. The explosion, 10 hours later, blew out most of the windows in the four-story concrete building, as well as some thick shutters and doors, allowing radiation to escape. The cause of the fire is still not known. But it is known that asphalt can become combustible when it gets hot enough. One theory is that a contaminant in one of the drums reacted with the nuclear waste, producing heat. A Belgian reprocessing plant had a similar accident in 1981. Government officials vowed to continue Japan's nuclear program, saying that while the accident had damaged public confidence, the basic technology was sound. ''If we judge the accident from only the technical point of view, we don't have a severe problem,'' said Yoichi Fujiie, a member of Japan's Atomic Energy Commission, which makes nuclear policy. But it is becoming harder for the Government to find places willing to accept the many more nuclear power plants that it wants to build. And in Rokkasho, where a new, larger reprocessing plant is planned, ''We can no longer welcome the facility as warmheartedly as before,'' said Yasuhiro Kobayashi, a local official. Even in Tokai, some people are having second thoughts -- something new in the town that became the site of Japan's first research reactor in 1959 and first commercial nuclear power plant in 1965. About a third of the 33,000 residents are dependent on the nuclear industry, and about 40 percent of the municipal tax revenue comes from the industry. ''For the first time, my anger just exploded,'' said Yoko Owada, 59, who runs a vegetable stand. ''I no longer trust them.'' Katsuhiro Terunuma, a food wholesaler, said orders from elsewhere in Japan for dried sweet potatoes, the local specialty, dropped 40 percent in the days after the accident. Still, if Tokai is any indication, opposition will not be strong enough to stall Japan's nuclear plans. ''The people from outside the area are more worried than the local people,'' said Tetsuji Fujita, 60, who works at the local agricultural co-op. ''My daughter, who lives elsewhere, called me in the middle of the night saying I shouldn't go outside.'' ''People have lived with the facility for decades,'' said Akiko Kawano, 19, a cashier in a toy store. The store's name is Atom.",1997-03-25T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,world

Regulatory capture certainly was at the center of the Fukushima meltdown, as the special committee set up by the Japanese government seems to agree. There was too cozy a relationship between the promoters and regulators of the nuclear industry, who were both part of the same agency. Mr. Brodsky suggests that the situation in the United States is no different from that in Japan. Our Nuclear Regulatory Commission was made independent in 1974 from what was then the Atomic Energy Commission, now the Department of Energy. Since then the N.R.C. has done an effective job of regulating the industry, and N.R.C. regulations are regarded worldwide as the gold standard for nuclear safety. No agency, even our N.R.C., is perfect. But to equate this with regulatory capture is to make a full marching band out of a piccolo or two.

The dance hall was grand, too: how the breeze off the Hudson whipped through and twirled skirts. A quarter got you into the park; a dime bought you a spin in a speedboat. ''You would see all the steamers come up the river -- the Hendrick Hudson, Robert Fulton, the Alexander -- and stop at the park with all the people from the city,'' recalled Sal Bottiglieri, 73, who used to work there. ''We would be amused by seeing people enjoying themselves in the dance hall or getting wet on the speedboats. People out from the city thought they were in the country.'' This was Indian Point Park. Yes, that Indian Point, before atoms were split there to make electricity. Now the only pools are filled with spent radioactive fuel; the water is quite toasty, but no swimming is allowed. Neutrons do all the dancing. A Coast Guard cutter on patrol is the only boat allowed to approach. How did a nuclear power plant end up in an amusement park? First, understand the park and its tie to the river. The old Hudson River Day Line opened it on June 26, 1923, at a site that was once a brickyard and farmland. The company named the 240-acre patch of forest ''Indian Point''; it had learned that the area was once traversed by the Kitchawank Tribe and thought the name would be catchy, said Francis Stein, the Buchanan historian. For years, the park was just that. Carnival rides. Miniature golf. Dances (where the Indian Point 3 control room now sits). A beer hall (where the Indian Point 2 reactor stands). Indian Point drew more than 5,000 people on weekends and hundreds on weekdays. Mr. Stein's collection of vintage postcards paints a bucolic image of pre- and postwar frivolity so different from the image of the plant today. But the park began to lose its luster after World War II. The popularity of the automobile, which broadened the choice of day trips and vacation spots, doomed the steamers and, in turn, Indian Point. ''I was disappointed that the park was going,'' Mr. Stein said. ''It was just such a great place to meet people.'' By the early 1950's, the owner was looking to sell. Con Edison was looking to buy. The utility was struggling to meet the growing electricity needs of the region, especially in Westchester County, where the suburbs were mushrooming. From 1950 to 1960, the county's population rose by 183,075, to 808,891, its largest 10-year gain in the last century. That, with the increasing use of appliances like air conditioners and televisions, pushed the demand for electricity higher and higher. Con Ed needed new plants. But it was already weathering criticism over air pollution from its oil and coal plants. An answer was emerging in a promising new technology: atomic energy. The federal government had begun its ''atoms for peace'' program to promote the idea that atomic energy could be cheap and was not just for weapons. It was working with a handful of utilities to make nuclear power a reality. Con Edison put itself in the vanguard in the summer of 1954, announcing that it would develop an experimental nuclear reactor and, a first, do it without government assistance, gambling that nuclear power would prove less costly than conventional fuels in the long run. The utility focused on Indian Point. There was plenty of river water to support machinery. A rail line ran nearby. It was close to transmission lines. And the village of Buchanan welcomed Con Ed's promises to fix roads, street lights, sewers and expand police and other municipal services. News accounts at the time suggested that the plant's location outside New York City but not far from it was vital to ensuring that power could be generated if the city were attacked with an atomic bomb, although no utility executive was quoted on that. In contrast to the vociferous campaign to close the plant today, hardly a peep of protest was heard at its inception. The atom was fascinating; awareness of its dangers even in peaceful uses came later. ''At that point, people were just not aware of radiation as a public health problem,'' said Sam Walker, the historian for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, whose predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission, approved the plant. Con Edison proceeded with its plans with little study of the site. The Atomic Energy Commission offered little guidance because it had experience with only one commercial nuclear reactor, the Shippingport Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania, which opened in 1957, said Philip L. Cantelon, a historian who has studied Con Edison. ''That Con Edison had not carried out any seismological, hydrological or meteorological tests to check the nuclear suitability of Indian Point was hardly surprising,'' Mr. Cantelon wrote in a paper about the company's nuclear history. ''The sudden push toward commercial nuclear power created situations without precedent.'' To Con Edison's engineers, he added, ''the way to understanding was through doing.'' What became known as Indian Point 1 powered up on Aug. 2, 1962, two years behind schedule, reaching full power on Jan. 25, 1963, after problems with its piping were repaired. So confident was Con Ed of this new technology that it planned to build six reactors here, and later it even set its sights on New York City, where it said its next nuclear reactor should be located to be most competitive with fossil fuel plants. Con Ed proposed a nuclear reactor in Ravenswood, Queens, across the East River from East 68th Street. That proposal, and later plans to build a nuclear plant on Davids Island, off New Rochelle, failed after a public outcry. Just as Indian Point 1 came online, public awareness of radiation hazards was growing, mainly as reports of radiation fallout from atomic and hydrogen bomb testing in the western deserts and the South Pacific increased. It did not help that Hollywood began picking up radiation as a theme for horror movies about mutated animals, insects and people. Still, Con Edison pressed on, though its plans for a nuclear plant farm were scaled down. It opened Indian Point 2 in 1974 and Indian Point 3 in 1976. Both reactors have troubled records, with frequent breakdowns and mishaps, though none that endangered the public, regulators say. It took the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979 to end development of nuclear plants; no plant has been opened in the nation since. That accident also threw a harsh light on Indian Point, with growing doubts that people could be evacuated in a similar emergency there. Later that year, Robert Ryan, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff member testifying in 1979 before a presidential commission investigating the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania, called Indian Point ''one of the most inappropriate sites in existence'' for a nuclear plant. Looking back, those in Buchanan who knew Indian Point then and now get a little nostalgic about the park, even if they support the plant today. Many have strong feelings because the plant provided 90 percent of the village's tax base. ''I don't think any of us could afford a home here if they took away the assessment from the reactors,'' said Mr. Bottiglieri, the former park worker. But for Mr. Bottiglieri and others the memories of those summers long ago burn brightly. Al Chopyack, 75, used to wear a diving helmet to go down and scrub the bottom of the pool. He remembers the mess the berries from the mulberry trees made on the trails in the park. He also remembers that ''a lot of local people met their spouses there.'' Working at the park ''was more fun than work,'' he said. ''Indian Point was such a beautiful place.''

Re Barry Edelson's ''Shoreham Evacuation: Like the Blizzard of '86?'': Mr. Edelson raises the possibility that Long Islanders will behave in an irrational manner if there is a nuclear accident at the Shoreham nuclear power plant. Re Barry Edelson's ''Shoreham Evacuation: Like the Blizzard of '86?'': Mr. Edelson raises the possibility that Long Islanders will behave in an irrational manner if there is a nuclear accident at the Shoreham nuclear power plant. I have more confidence in the well-educated, well-read Long Island public. Public fears will surely disintegrate after the Shoreham plant opens and our elected officials keep us advised of the intense, 24-hour surveillance any nuclear power plant receives from local health and safety authorities. May I project the opposite supposition: Shoreham is closed and dismantled and Long Islanders face the alternative scenario, an 800-megawatt coal burner. Governor Mario Cuomo has already told us, quietly so that many may not have noticed, that he has coal burning in mind for a Long Island without Shoreham. He calls his coal burner a ''fossil-fueled base load power plant.'' There are only three choices among fossil-fuel base load power plants: natural gas, oil or coal. New oil-fired base load power plants have been illegal since 1973, and 800 megawatts of electric power would double Long Island's present gas consumption. That quantity of gas is just not available to Long Island, nor are the pipe lines in place or on order. Natural gas is another depleting finite resource we are consuming faster than we are discovering. If the Shoreham plant is abandoned, Long Islanders will have coal burners in their back yard. An 800 megawatt coal burner will burn 400 tons of coal per hour, 576,000 tons of coal every 60 days. Burning 576,000 tons of coal will produce about 30,000 tons of acidic, poisonous, carcinogenic, radioactive ash and sludge every 60 days. Can Long Islanders seriously contemplate disposing of such a quantity of hazardous solid waste? Obviously out of the question. The coal and utility industries, aware of the need to burn coal more cleanly, have been developing the fluid-bed combustion method for 30 years. When fluid-bed combustion is developed, possibly after the year 2000, it will eliminate the poisons from the flue gases and transfer them to the ash and sludge, making them more lethal than they already are. The poisons endemic to coal burning are delivered with the coal. There are three nuclear power plants in Connecticut, about eight miles from Orient Point. Wouldn't an evacuation plan, properly supported by Long Island's elected officials, make Long Island a safer place regardless of Shoreham? An evacuation plan, with its sophisticated communication system, will reduce the effects of blizzards too. HERBERT JAFFE Association of Investors New York Utilities Inc.

41e87543-702e-4585-a13d-a86ca649b3ee,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/18/world/asia/after-fukushima-fighting-the-power-of-tepco.html,Utility Reform Eluding Japan After Nuclear Plant Disaster,"TOKYO — In a direct act of rebellion against Tokyo Electric Power Company, which owns the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant, the local government in Tokyo is moving swiftly to build a huge natural gas facility that would generate as much electricity as a nuclear reactor. The plant would ensure a stable supply of electricity for the capital in the aftermath of the nuclear meltdowns in March at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. But more important, the city government says, it could spur desperately needed change in Japan. By weakening Tokyo Electric, or Tepco, reformers hope to finally break the linchpin of the collusion between business and government that once drove Japan’s rapid postwar rise, but that now keeps it mired in stagnation. “Now’s our chance,” said Naoki Inose, Tokyo’s vice governor, invoking an ancient proverb about attacking a wild dog only after it has fallen into a river: “On March 11, Tepco became the dog that fell into the river. Only then can you fight against such a formidable foe.” So formidable a foe, in fact, that just eight months after Japanese leaders vowed the nuclear disaster — like the end of World War II — would lead to a kind of rebirth, the chances for fundamental change are rapidly slipping away. Already, the reformers have lost a crucial ally: Naoto Kan, who as prime minister had called for an end to nuclear power and major changes to the power industry. He was eased out of office with the help of Japan’s most powerful corporate lobby, a faithful Tepco supporter that, like many members of Japan’s establishment, has benefited from the company’s largess. And Mr. Kan’s successor, Yoshihiko Noda, whose party came to power promising to build a new Japan, instead joined the old guard to rally around nuclear power, and Tepco. “In the early months after the accident, I thought there was a real chance for change, but now the move to turn Fukushima into an opportunity for radical reforms is losing steam,” said Hiroshi Okumura, an economist and the author of “Dismantling Tepco.” “There’s a very big risk that Japan’s lost decade, which became the lost 20 years, will now become the lost 30 years.” It is difficult to overstate the influence of Tepco, which rivals the American defense industry in its domestic reach. Thanks to a virtual monopoly and a murky electricity pricing system, it has become one of the biggest sources of loosely regulated cash for politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen, who have repaid Tepco with unquestioning support and with the type of lax oversight that contributed to the nuclear crisis. The pockets of insurgency against Tepco are being led by politicians like Mr. Inose, who successfully took on the nation’s road construction monopoly a few years ago; a team of bureaucrats who lost power after an earlier aborted attempt at energy deregulation; and some of Japan’s most innovative businessmen. Arrayed against them are the interests that have long profited from the virtually unchallenged hold on the market enjoyed by the company and the nation’s nine other utilities. The corporate lobby, the Japan Business Federation or Keidanren, came out clearly against deregulation, leading to a public clash with one of its highest-profile members, Hiroshi Mikitani, an entrepreneur whose 14-year-old company, Rakuten, has grown into Japan’s largest online shopping mall and is rapidly expanding overseas. Over Twitter, Mr. Mikitani, 46, said the utilities’ “monopoly and the collusion among politicians, bureaucrats, businesses and the news media” were preventing deregulation. In leaving Keidanren, the business federation, he accused it of furthering Japan’s “Galapagosization” — a neologism signifying Japan’s growing tendency to turn inward, relying on a shrinking home market as it fails to compete globally. Supporters of the power industry argue that deregulation will only hurt the country, blaming it for causing blackouts in countries like the United States with deregulated markets. “The revolutionaries feel it’s fun to smash existing things,” said Yosuke Kondo, a lawmaker and a former deputy minister in the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which oversees the energy sector. “Why do they feel the need to smash something that we can boast to the world about?” The clearest sign yet that Mr. Kondo and his allies appear to have the upper hand was a recent government decision to inject $11.5 billion into Tepco, the first of many payouts needed to keep the company afloat and help it compensate the 90,000 people forced to flee areas near Fukushima Daiichi. The bailout, which protects Tepco’s shareholders and creditors, will almost certainly require raising electricity rates. So far, the government has asked very little in return. “I think the chances are seven to three that Tepco wins and survives completely unchanged,” said Tatsuo Hatta, an economist and supporter of deregulation. “If there’s another tsunami and another nuclear plant gets destroyed, then they’re 50-50.” Costly for Consumers Government policies are at the heart of Tepco’s power. Japan, almost alone among industrialized nations, has not deregulated its energy grid, so utilities have a stranglehold on both the generation and the transmission of electricity. What is more, power companies are allowed to set electricity rates according to a complex system that includes a vast range of often unclear expenses. The more a utility spends, the more it can charge. The policy, which was meant to further a national strategy of developing nuclear power, had the predictable effect of encouraging Tepco to overspend, according to a 230-page report released last month by a government panel investigating Tepco’s management. The panel found that Tepco — whose net income was $1.7 billion in 2009 and whose 192 plants powered a third of Japan — had a vast network of related companies to which it doled out inflated contracts. Some of those companies, in turn, arranged deals with large manufacturers, allowing them a share of the wealth. “It’s an incredible system,” said Kaichiro Shimura, the author of “The Tepco Empire” and a former newspaper reporter who covered Tepco. “The only losers are the consumers.” Japanese, in fact, pay on average double what Americans do for electricity. Perhaps worse, critics say, Tepco became Japan’s biggest “cash box.” Besides paying inflated costs to other members of Keidanren that provided it with equipment or services, the company donated copious amounts to political fund-raisers, made generous donations for academic research and bought advertisements in the news media, even though it had no real competitors. Tepco also offered lucrative postretirement jobs to bureaucrats from government ministries and the national police. In return, few challenged Tepco’s practices, even as it became the main player in Japan’s nuclear establishment, known as the “nuclear power village.” “Tepco lies at the center of collusion,” said Takeshi Sasaki, the former president of the University of Tokyo. “You can’t reform the nuclear power village without first fixing Tepco.” In an interview, Toshio Nishizawa, Tepco’s chief executive, waved away such suggestions that his company had outsize influence. “I’ve worked at Tepco for a long time, and it’s just not the case that we control this or that,” he said. “We don’t have that kind of power.” Out to Break Monopolies Early this month, in a northern town called Obihiro, a construction crew broke ground on a solar farm that could grow into a full-fledged revolt against Tepco and other utilities. The farm is the first of many that Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of Softbank, the telecommunications giant, wants to build across Japan. A decade ago, Mr. Son, Japan’s richest man and widely regarded as its most iconoclastic business leader, broke the monopoly of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone. To loosen the utilities’ grip on the power grid, he has won the backing of the governors of 33 of the 47 prefectures, who appear to be responding to growing popular sentiment against nuclear power. That is what Tokyo is trying on a smaller scale with its natural gas plant, which city officials say will yield enough electricity to power its subway system and light many public buildings. “At the very least, we should achieve some measure of reform,” Mr. Inose said. “Of course, because there are so many vested interests, it won’t be possible to solve everything.” Indeed, Mr. Inose remains cautious about pursuing what many regard as the holy grail of deregulation: separating power generation and transmission, which would automatically create more companies and competition. A previous failed attempt at change is often cited as evidence of the control wielded by Tepco and its allies. In the mid-1990s, after most industrialized nations split the two halves of the business, a small group inside the Economy Ministry tried to do the same. Tepco and the other utilities pushed back fiercely. They reached out to the then-governing Liberal Democratic Party, said Taro Kono, a lawmaker in the party and one of its few critics of nuclear power. Tepco and Keidanren handpicked a former Tepco vice president, Tokio Kano, for one of the legislative seats the party reserves for Keidanren, and he helped quash the ministry renegades. Keidanren declined to make any of its officials available to comment for this article. Tepco’s chief executive, Mr. Nishizawa, said keeping generation and transmission united was best for a stable power supply. With no political support, the ministry group, led by an official named Seiji Murata, had no chance. “Murata’s people were pushed out in a coup d’état,” said Yoshio Shioya, who has written extensively on nuclear issues. Then came the Fukushima disaster. One of Mr. Murata’s top lieutenants, Satoshi Kusakabe, was charged with drafting a new energy policy by next summer. Mr. Kusakabe, working for the Cabinet Office, has brought back two allies from a decade ago to press forward with the separation of generation and transmission despite opposition from the ministry. But it is unclear how much power Mr. Kusakabe’s team, which was appointed by the former prime minister, really has. Some experts say that, to placate critics of the industry and nuclear power, the government may simply mandate changes with little effect — as happened a decade ago. An Attempt to Open Up On paper, much of Japan’s power industry has been deregulated in the past decade. The emptiness of that deregulation, which has become increasingly evident since the Fukushima disaster, underscores the difficulties faced by current challengers. The history makes clear that though the protection of Tepco and the industry began under the long-serving Liberal Democrats, it has continued under the Democratic Party of Japan, which grabbed power in 2009 with promises to untangle the ties between business and government. In one effort to break the utilities’ virtual monopolies, 60 percent of Japan’s electricity market was opened up by 2005 to so-called power producers and suppliers, companies that act as brokers, buying electricity (mostly from manufacturers that generate their own) and selling it to commercial customers. A market, the Japan Electric Power Exchange, or JEPX, was established to allow wholesale trading. But despite offering rates that are often a third cheaper than utilities’, the companies, which must depend on utilities’ transmission lines, have captured only 2 percent of the market. Reluctant to lose customers to the new companies, the utilities make it difficult for them to access their transmission networks. When the Fukushima nuclear plant went offline in March, leaving Tepco unable to supply the Tokyo area with enough power, the new companies believed it spelled opportunity for them. Instead, the government mandated that all commercial customers — including the new companies’ customers — lower their electricity consumption by 15 percent. That effectively left the new companies with an extra 15 percent supply. But the government offered a solution: sell to Tepco. “In theory, we were competing,” said Tsutomu Takei, who retired in June as the chief executive of Ennet, the largest new power company. “In a real competitive market, if your rival happens to get hurt, it’s a chance for you to increase your share.” Ennet was forced to sell its electricity directly to Tepco for a price lower than what it charged its own customers, reportedly leading to monthly losses of about $130,000. Under another past attempt at deregulation, the other utilities were allowed to compete against Tepco and one another. But they demurred, preferring to keep their monopolies intact. And since the Fukushima disaster, the other utilities have rallied strongly behind Tepco, clearly afraid that its breakup would mean the same for them. Those with nuclear plants even agreed to contribute $90 million to Tepco’s bailout, one of the clearest indications yet that the web of influence the company wove over the years remains intact. “It was designed to protect the company and keep it just the way it is,” said Mr. Okumura, the author of “Dismantling Tepco.” The problem, he said, is that the bailout “isn’t just about one company.” The battle against Tepco has evolved into a contest over the future of Japan itself.",2011-11-18T04:38:01.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

When it came down to this week's deadline, the New York Legislature decided that Long Islanders feared high electric costs more than nuclear power. Instead of acting boldly on this new perception by turning down an agreement to decommission the Shoreham nuclear power plant and putting the $5 billion-plus facility to productive use, they left town. No doubt the legislators hope that ratepayers will blame Governor Cuomo, not them, for the nuclear presence and the high cost of removing it. But Mr. Cuomo can still win on two fronts, shrewd politics and wise policy. There was and is only one sensible thing to do with Shoreham: Make electricity. Two facts about Shoreham are basic. The plant, incorporating all safety features now required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is safer than others now in operation. Second, except for cost overruns through faulty management, the basic value of the plant is ultimately payable by Lilco's customers under rate formulas of the Public Service Commission. When Governor Cuomo recognized Long Island's resistance to the plant, he instituted a policy of planned neglect of all steps required for a Federal operating permit. The refusal of local authorities to participate in evacuation planning led Lilco finally to negotiate the agreement with the Governor. In return for giving up Shoreham, the utility would be allowed to raise electric rates 63 percent over 10 years. Acknowledging Long Islanders' fear of high rates, and certain that Republican state senators from Long Island would blame him for them, Mr. Cuomo insisted that the Legislature accept joint responsibility for the buyout plan. By refusing to play, the Legislature appears to think he can be made solely responsible for the future rate rises. The Legislature is clever, but the Governor still holds the winning ace. He is able to point out that, since the deadline passed without legislative action, the power of decision has been handed by the Legislature to Lilco. The utility will, of course, try to win its nuclear operating license. Meanwhile, any time it finds the buyout more attractive it can change its course. Governor Cuomo properly contends that without legislative approval the agreement he proposed is no agreement, leaving Lilco no choice but to push ahead toward operating Shoreham. The Legislature has, in effect, given tacit assent to Lilco's application to open the plant as preferable to the buyout. Playing this ace, the Governor not only can restore a political balance in his favor. He can also help assure Long Islanders of what they will otherwise have trouble achieving: an adequate, safe source of power.",1988-12-03T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,opinion

Chile, a country that imports much of its energy, is considering building nuclear reactors to try to fill an expected energy gap in the next few decades. But the developing nuclear crisis in Japan has complicated the debate in Chile, which suffered an 8.8-magnitude earthquake last year that caused widespread destruction. The three-page accord focuses on training nuclear engineers, not on building reactors. It calls for cooperation in the areas of “operation and utilization of nuclear research reactors,” safety, radioactive waste management and scientific exchange. Chile’s foreign minister and United States Ambassador Alejandro Wolff signed the accord, as had been previously scheduled, on Friday, and American and Chilean officials denied that its importance had been downgraded because of the concerns stemming from the Japanese disaster. It had been expected to be a highlight of President Obama’s one-day visit to Chile on Monday. Chile’s mining and energy minister, Laurence Golborne, signed a similar accord with France last month. But Mr. Golborne said Tuesday that the government needed to carefully study the situation in Japan before committing to a nuclear program. “We may decide we don’t want this type of energy and we will have to analyze other sources of energy,” he said. Chile’s senate president had lobbied to abandon the nuclear accord, and some lawmakers, frustrated at not being shown the wording in advance, have called Mr. Golborne to testify about it in hearings about Chile’s energy future. That appearance was delayed until after Mr. Obama’s visit next week. Chilean officials are concerned that limits on the amount of energy the country may import and its outdated power grid will compromise the rapid growth of its economy. Chile will require a doubling of its energy supplies over the next 12 years if demand for electricity continues to grow at 6 percent a year, said Jorge Zanelli, a physicist who carried out a study of nuclear energy in 2007 for the previous Chilean government. More than 60 percent of that increase would have to be met with energy from fossil fuels if nuclear energy is not part of the equation, Mr. Zanelli said. President Sebastián Piñera has also said the government should consider more sustainable renewable sources like solar, wind and geothermal power. Critics of nuclear energy said what happened in Japan should be a warning call to Chile. “Japan’s nightmare this past week has been very timely for the Chilean government and society to understand what the real risks and vulnerability involved for seismic countries wishing to develop nuclear power,” said Sara Larraín, executive director of Chile Sustentable, an environmental group.",2011-03-19T03:21:17.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-americas

Sonstelie takes the helm this week as chief executive of the fast-growing Puget Sound Power and Light Company, which has entered the 1990's on solid financial footing after some turbulent years of involvement in nuclear plants. He has been president and chief operating officer of the utility and will retain the title of president. As chief executive he succeeds John W. Ellis, who remains chairman. Mr. Ellis is also a principal partner in the Baseball Club of Seattle, a group of investors, including executives from Nintendo of America Inc., who are attempting to buy the Mariners team. Puget Power, based in Bellevue, Wash., has been struggling for years to find reliable sources of power for its customers, who now number 1.7 million. The number is growing 3 percent a year, twice the national average for electric utilities. Nuclear Plants Abandoned When Mr. Sonstelie, now 47 years old, joined the utility in 1974, regional energy planners were warning that the Pacific Northwest faced power shortages. As a result, the utility invested in five nuclear power plants. All were eventually scrapped. But millions of dollars had gone into the plants, and shareholder values were wrecked from the write-offs. ""Those were very combative times for us,"" Mr. Sonstelie said. ""Our annual meeting today was very peaceful. A dozen years ago, rate payer advocates would buy one share just so they could come to annual meetings and confront us. ""But we've changed, too. We now try to get input from citizens before we make a major decision, rather than announce what we intend to do and in return have them fight us. This cooperation has helped us turn the corner on relationships with customers. A decade ago there wasn't even a glimmer of this."" Today, the utility has recovered financially and reports nearly $1 billion in revenue and $2 billion in assets. Shareholder equity rose 7 percent in 1991, and per-share earnings by 2.3 percent. Emphasis on Conservation In the next decade, Mr. Sonstelie said, the company will rely on conservation, and on small-scale hydroelectric units and other renewable energy resources. He said it would also buy the output of plants built by independent power producers. He became interested in nuclear energy while at the United States Military Academy because the Army was interested in building a nuclear power program. After he graduated in 1966, the Army sent him to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned a master's degree in nuclear engineering. He then went to Vietnam with the Army Corps of Engineers and he served as a combat commander. He later received a master's degree from the Harvard Business School. He began his civilian career in the early 1970's as a project manager at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratories in New Mexico. He joined Puget Power in 1974 as an engineer and by 1980 headed engineering and operations. He was named executive vice president in 1985, president in 1987 and chief operating officer in 1991.

Ukraine and Russia blame each other.,"Image Russia has held the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant since March. Credit... Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters Ukraine accused Russian forces on Sunday of firing rockets that landed on the grounds of a nuclear power plant that Russia has seized in the south of the country, further raising the risk of an accident at a complex where the United Nations’ nuclear agency has said that the principles of nuclear safety have been violated. A pro-Russian regional official blamed Ukrainian forces for the attack. The rockets fired Saturday evening landed near a dry spent fuel storage facility, where 174 casks are stored, each containing 24 assemblies of spent nuclear fuel, according to Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear energy company. One person was wounded by shrapnel and many windows were damaged. “Apparently, they aimed specifically at the casks with spent fuel, which are stored in the open near the site of shelling,” the company said in a post on the Telegram social messaging app. Three radiation detection monitors were damaged so “timely detection and response in case of aggravation of the radiation situation or leakage of radiation from spent nuclear fuel casks are currently impossible,” the post said, adding that a catastrophe was “miraculously avoided.” Russian forces have controlled the Zaporizhzhia plant since March. A representative of Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate, Andrei Yusov, said that Russia was shelling the site to destroy infrastructure and damage power lines that supply electricity to Ukraine’s national grid and, ultimately, to cause a power blackout in the south of the country. There was no independent confirmation of the assertion. The head of the pro-Russian administration in Zaporizhzhia, Yevgeny Balitsky, said on Telegram on Sunday that Ukrainian forces had used an Uragan cluster rocket to target the spent fuel storage area and damage administrative buildings. On Thursday, Russia’s defense ministry said that Ukraine had launched an artillery strike against the plant. During a national television phone-in show on Sunday, the head of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, Oleksandr Starukh, said that there was only a three-second delay between the firing and the landing of each shell, using this as evidence that the attack had come from Russian forces nearby. Since invading Ukraine in February, Russia has made it a priority to seize critical infrastructure including power plants, ports, transportation, and agricultural storage and production facilities. It has also targeted infrastructure in Ukrainian hands. In an earlier post, Energoatom said that Russian shellfire had damaged a nitrogen-oxygen unit and the combined auxiliary building. “There are still risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances, and the fire hazard is also high,” the post said. Mr. Yusov also said on Telegram that Russian forces had laid mines at the plant’s power units. Concern about safety at Zaporizhzhia has been mounting since March, when a fire broke out in a building during fighting as Russian forces took control. The Ukrainian authorities say that Russian forces have since stored weapons, including artillery, at the plant, and that in recent weeks they began shelling Nikopol, a nearby city held by Ukraine, from positions on its grounds. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in a speech late on Saturday that there had been a “significant worsening of the situation around the plant,” and added that Russia had become the first country in the world “to use a nuclear plant for terror.” On Sunday, he spoke with the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and said in a tweet that he had called for a stronger international response against Russia’s “nuclear terror.” The prospect of a Ukrainian counteroffensive to reclaim land in Kherson Province, which is southwest of Zaporizhzhia, also heightens instability. Ukraine was the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident when, in 1986, a reactor fire broke out at the Chernobyl complex in the country’s north. There are no reports of a radiation leak at Zaporizhzhia. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said that a particular concern is its inability to access Zaporizhzhia for monitoring purposes. Ukrainian plant workers operate under stress, in part because Russian authorities suspect the possibility of sabotage, and the exiled mayor of the nearby city of Enerhodar, Dmytro Orlov, has said that some workers had been interrogated or have disappeared, and that at least one had been killed.",2022-08-07T21:36:11.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire
5888da3b-0df2-4d30-a144-766e36391b73,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/world/asia/us-and-south-korea-reach-revised-nuclear-deal.html,World Briefing | Asia; South Korea: Nuclear Deal Revised,"| Asia; South Korea: Nuclear Deal Revised SEOUL, South Korea — After four and a half years of low-key yet highly sensitive negotiations, the United States and South Korea announced a revised treaty on Wednesday that continues to deny — but not permanently rule out — South Korea the right to enrich uranium or reprocess spent nuclear fuel, even for peaceful purposes. South Korea has been prevented from enriching uranium and reprocessing spent-fuel, technologies used by countries such as North Korea to make nuclear weapons, under a 1972 treaty in which the United States helped South Korea build its nascent nuclear energy industry. The two governments started negotiations in 2010 to rewrite the treaty, which was originally set to expire in 2013. But their differences were too big to resolve , leading them to sign a separate deal to extend the expiration date. South Korea insisted in the talks that it needed to enrich uranium to produce fuel for its fast-expanding nuclear energy industry. It also wanted to reprocess spent fuel to reduce its nuclear waste storage. But the United States maintained that allowing South Korea to employ those technologies, even for peaceful purposes, would set a bad precedent and undermine its global efforts to discourage the spread of activities that can be used to produce weapons-usable nuclear materials. Both sides announced on Wednesday that they had completed the bargaining, with the United States ambassador, Mark Lippert, and Park Ro-byug, the chief South Korean negotiator, initialing the text during a ceremony in Seoul, the South Korean capital. The agreement is subject to review by the United States Congress. The new treaty does not allow South Korea to enrich uranium or reprocess spent fuel anytime soon. But it does not commit South Korea to legally renounce these techniques either. transcript SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA (APRIL 22, 2015) (REUTERS - ACCESS ALL) (SOUNDBITE) (English) U.S. AMBASSADOR TO KOREA, MARK LIPPERT, SAYING: “This agreement will be a significant achievement for both of our governments and provide a strong foundation for our shared peaceful nuclear cooperation and non-proliferation objectives for decades to come.”  (SOUNDBITE) (Korean) SOUTH KOREAN AMBASSADOR FOR NUCLEAR ENERGY COOPERATION, PARK RO-BYUG, SAYING: “Both the United States and South Korea have agreed on a bilateral deal to expand cooperation for mutual benefits and advance, focusing on three major issues including management of spent fuel, stable supply of fuel and promoting nuclear power plant export.” Instead, it leaves open the possibility that South Korea could enrich uranium for civil nuclear energy “in the future through consultations with the United States.” In the meantime, Washington promised to help secure a supply of nuclear fuel for South Korean atomic power plants, Seoul said in a news release. The deal also created the option for South Korea to have its spent fuel reprocessed abroad in countries that both Seoul and Washington believed posed no proliferation risk. The United States also promised to help South Korea find new nuclear waste management options that would be economically viable and more proliferation-resistant. As part of such efforts, South Korea said its scientists would be allowed to do early experiments on a kind of nuclear reprocessing known as pyroprocessing. The new treaty also establishes a high-level committee that will assess the implementation of the treaty. The United States hailed the treaty as reaffirming “the two governments’ shared commitment to nonproliferation.” Ju Chul-ki, senior secretary for foreign affairs for President Park Geun-hye of South Korea, said the agreement reflected his country’s status as a major player in civil nuclear energy. Lee Byong-chul, a senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul, said the deal was beneficial for both countries, though it reminded South Koreans of the constraints placed upon their country’s nuclear industry. South Korea is the world’s fifth-largest nuclear energy producer, with 23 reactors providing 36 percent of the country’s electricity needs. It has also presented nuclear power plants as one of its new export items. (The country is building four reactors for the United Arab Emirates.) Yet the country currently has to import all of its enriched uranium fuel because of the obligations imposed under the treaty with the United States. After decades of running nuclear power plants, nuclear waste has also become a growing concern. In this small, densely populated country with an increasingly vociferous environmental movement, building a new, central repository for its spent nuclear fuel has become a huge headache for the government.",2015-04-22T15:45:01.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Four 440-megawatt nuclear plants on the Danube now supply about 25 percent of Bulgaria's electrical power. A 1,000-megawatt plant is scheduled to be completed in 13 months, and a second one is in the planning stage. When the big units begin operating, Bulgaria will be depending on nuclear power for up to 50 percent of its electricity requirements, according to Stanka Nozharova, the chief atomic energy specialist at the Ministry of Energy. Mrs. Nozharova said that as a result of this concentration Bulgaria, with a population of nine million, ''leads at the moment'' in per capita use of nuclear power. Lack of Hydroelectric Power Nearly 30 percent of Bulgaria's territory, roughly the size of Pennsylvania, is mountainous, and an additional 40 percent is hilly land, but there is a distinct lack of rivers that lend themselves to hydropower generation. ''The only big river is the Danube,'' said Mrs. Nozharova, who said the river's low banks along the course of Bulgaria's frontier with Rumania did not lend themselves to damming. As a result, she said, Bulgaria is able to get only about 8.2 percent of its total electricity output from stations on rivers, like the Momino-Klisura power station. She said there were 63 hydroelectric power stations in Bulgaria. Even this use of rivers is somewhat chancy because Bulgaria suffers frequent droughts. Reservoirs for Sofia's drinking water along the Iskar River were extremely low this spring. Mrs. Nozharova said most of Bulgaria's water resources were used for industry, urban water supply and irrigation of farmland, rather than for power generation. Bulgaria has pockets of brown coal and lignite in the center of the country and in the west, as well as a fair-sized field near the Black Sea port of Burgas. But the caloric value is low and it has a high percentage of ash and moisture. Since Bulgaria depends on its seacoast for the bulk of its hard-currency income from tourism, it has been deemed undesirable to burn lignite near the coast. Still, Bulgaria gets about 50 percent of its energy from thermal power stations burning domestic coal. There are about a dozen such large stations. There are also energy imports. Bulgaria is tied to the Soviet power grid by way of the 400-kilovolt Druzhba, or Friendship, line. In addition, there are small-scale exchanges of power along the borders with neighboring Rumania, Greece and Yugoslavia. Imports represent a little more than 10 percent of Bulgaria's energy consumption. Power Cuts Last Winter However, during the severe winter of 1984-85, when temperatures fell to 15 degrees below zero and lower, Bulgaria asked for and was denied additional energy shipments from the Soviet Union, according to Western diplomats here. Freezing of the open-face coal pits made it impossible to carry on surface mining of lignite for a time. The power authorities had to shut off electricity to households for periods of three to six hours in January and February. All this has made the dependable supply of electricity from nuclear power plants all the more attractive for Bulgaria, Mrs. Nozharova said. Asked about safety at nuclear plants, she said that ''the question of safety is a big one in every country.'' She said the reactors at Kozlodui, on the Danube north of Sofia, had ''proven to have a high level of safety and efficiency.'' She said these pressurized water reactors, supplied by Atomenergoeksport, the Soviet agency, were built with three times the specified safety factor. Supplemental equipment for the Kozlodui reactors has been purchased from France, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Japan. Bulgaria will need the added capacity of the new 1,000-megawatt reactors, she said, not least because household consumption of energy is increasing at a rate of 11 percent a year.",1985-06-09T09:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world

Niagara Mohawk joins many other utilities that want to dispose of their nuclear plants and focus instead on the distribution of power, which is seen as a promising business under the coming era of deregulation. For Amergen, a joint venture of the PECO Energy Company and British Energy P.L.C., the potential purchase of Niagara's Nine Mile Point property, near Syracuse, represents a bet that it can profitably operate the installation in a region where power prices are high. Niagara said yesterday that it was in talks with a potential buyer, which it would not identify. A person close to the discussions said the potential buyer was Amergen. The company declined to comment. The purchase price under discussion was not known, but it is likely to sell for much less than the $1.5 billion value of the property listed on Niagara's books. Amergen's purchase of the working reactor at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania cost it $100 million. Niagara's holdings consist of a 41 percent interest in the Nine Mile 2 reactor, which began to operate in 1988. It was one of the most expensive nuclear plants built, costing $4.6 billion. The company also owns all of Nine Mile 1, which is 30 years old and cost $550 million to build. Together, they produce 1,753 megawatts of electricity, enough to light nearly two million homes. Robert Rubin, a utility analyst with Bear, Stearns, estimated that Niagara might get $135 million from a sale. From 1988 to 1991, both plants suffered a series of outages and were put on the watch list of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In recent years, however, both plants have operated well. Nine Mile 1, for example, operated above 90 percent capacity last year, which is considered a very high level. Amergen is one of two companies that have been looking to buy nuclear power plants. The other is the Entergy Corporation, a major utility in the Southwest, which recently bought the Pilgrim nuclear plant near Plymouth, Mass. from Boston Edison for $80 million. Niagara's shares rose 62.5 cents yesterday, to $15.5625.",1999-01-29T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business

The move, while reminiscent of a Greenpeace action, was highly unusual in understated Japan. But it was emblematic of the islanders’ nearly three-decade fight against the powers arrayed against them — their own government and the nuclear industry it has championed. “The sea is our livelihood,” said Ms. Takebayashi, 68, whose family has fished for sea bream, mackerel and other local delicacies for generations. “We will never let anyone sully it.” The story of Iwaishima’s battle has become something of a touchstone in Japan, especially among those who feel uneasy in the wake of the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant for having accepted decades of government assurances that nuclear power was safe. And because the plans to build the plant are closer to approval than any others in Japan, many antinuclear activists see the island’s struggle as their best hope of ending the country’s reliance on nuclear energy. If the plans are scuttled, they believe, the decision is likely to set a precedent that will end the construction of nuclear plants in Japan. Iwaishima’s tale of resistance started in 1982. The town of Kaminoseki — made up of Iwaishima, two islets and the Murotsu peninsula off Japan’s main island, Honshu — was one of many backwaters that seemed ripe for the revitalization that the nuclear industry promised. With no industry to speak of beyond small-scale farming and fisheries, the town struggled to keep up with Japan’s rapid changes in the postwar era. So in 1982, when the Chugoku Electric Power Company first raised the idea of building a nuclear power plant on the peninsula’s deserted tip, many residents were enthusiastic. Chugoku Electric wooed them, paying for lavish “study tours” to nuclear reactors around the country — trips that included stops at hot springs, according to residents who participated. It also offered local fishing cooperatives compensation for the loss of fishing grounds that would be filled in to build the 3.5-million-square-foot plant. “The town needed the money,” said Katsumi Inoue, 67, who led a movement supporting the plant. “Kaminoseki was shrinking. We needed to grow.” But Iwaishima, an island of about 1,000 people just two and a half miles from the planned site, was not convinced. The island’s fishing cooperative voted overwhelmingly against the plans. On a chilly morning in January 1983, almost 400 islanders cut short their New Year’s festivities to stage a protest march, the men in their fishing boots and the women in bonnets, through alleyways lined with stone walls. It was the first of more than 1,000 protests the islanders would carry out, some of them involving scenes of high drama to rival Ms. Takebayashi’s 2009 protest. In one protest this year, a small armada of fishermen raced out to sea to head off the utility’s vessels. “No nuclear power plant here!” they shouted, their boats’ engines in full throttle. “This sea does not belong to you.” Not even the residents of Iwaishima are exactly sure why they were willing to challenge the establishment when so many of their compatriots were not. The best they can venture is that their livelihoods depend on the sea too much to take a chance, and that if disaster struck, it would be much harder to flee. Beyond that, many of the island’s men had, over time, left for work elsewhere. Some of them worked in nuclear plants, and they returned home with worrisome stories. They would become part of the front line in the island’s struggle. Kazuo Isobe, 88, was one of them. He left the island in Japan’s postwar chaos and initially worked at construction sites. But in the 1970s, he started work at the newly opened Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. He worked to clean up radioactive buildup at the plant’s No. 2 reactor, using rags while sweltering in a protective suit. His radiation records from the time, which he provided, show he received about 850 millirems of radiation during just three months of work — about the amount of radiation allowed for nuclear workers in a year, and more than eight times as much as the limit set for civilians. When Mr. Isobe heard, on a trip back to Iwaishima in 1982, that Chugoku Electric planned to build a nuclear plant just across the water, he was “terrified.” “I had seen with my own eyes that radiation is hard to contain,” Mr. Isobe said. “I told everyone in the neighborhood not to agree to anything they said.” Still, the larger town of Kaminoseki remained supportive of the plans, electing a pro-nuclear mayor in every election since 1983. A majority of the town council’s members are still for nuclear power. In 1994, the central government threw its weight behind the project, designating the plant a “critical source of electricity” for Japan. For its support, the town was handsomely rewarded. From 1984 to 2010, Kaminoseki received about 4.5 billion yen (about $58 million at current rates) in government subsidies, according to town records. It also received 2.4 billion yen, or $31 million, from the plant operator, according to local news media reports. But Iwaishima was not ready to give up. The islanders fielded antinuclear candidates for the city council. Iwaishima’s fishing cooperative refused to accept its share of cash gifts from Chugoku Electric, worth about 1 billion yen, or $13 million. And when Chugoku Electric submitted a study of the plant’s environmental impact to the central government, protesters pointed out glaring omissions, like the failure to mention the porpoises that breed in nearby waters. The islanders also sued the utility, charging that part of the plant would stand on public land; Japan’s Supreme Court threw out that lawsuit in 2008, part of a pattern of similar legal losses for activists against nuclear power. (The islanders, meanwhile, were countersued by the utility for obstructing its construction plans.) “We did everything we could to throw obstacles in their path,” said Misao Ishii, 68, who fought a nine-year court battle over obstruction charges. Then in a crushing blow in 2008, Yamaguchi Prefecture, which controls some aspects of plant’s construction, gave Chugoku Electric permission for reclamation work to begin. Angry islanders built a hut near the construction site to spy on workers. And in September 2009, when Chugoku Electric tried to use buoys to mark off a section of the sea for reclamation, Ms. Takebayashi and her fellow commercial fishers raced into action. While she was tied to the dock, others headed out in their boats to stop the work vessels. But the next month, the utility’s boats used the cover of night to put buoys in place and declare the start of the reclamation work. Iwaishima, meanwhile, was losing a completely different kind of battle. As residents aged and the population shrank, the island’s economy suffered. Its elementary and middle schools were closed. By last March, its population had been reduced by half to 479, and the residents’ average age had climbed past 70. The antinuclear protests that used to go on for hours now lasted just 20 minutes, with the frail islanders no longer able to walk the cobbled paths for long. “It’s getting hard to keep fighting when everybody’s got a cane,” said Hisako Tao, 70. Then, on March 11, a catastrophic earthquake and tsunami wiped out the defenses at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, setting off one of the world’s worst nuclear disasters. “That changed everything,” said Mr. Isobe, who had worked at the plant. Last month, the governor of Yamaguchi Prefecture said he would not renew the license permitting Chugoku Electric to perform reclamation work. Surrounding towns have declared their opposition to the construction plans. Even the mayor of Kaminoseki, Shigemi Kashiwabara, long a proponent of the planned power plant, suggested that it might have to be scrapped. “We may have to think about building a town with no nuclear power,” he recently told a town council meeting. Last month, the new president at Chugoku Electric told employees that the company would push ahead with plans for the nuclear plant. Company leaders also assured local politicians that it would be fitted with the latest earthquake-proof technology.

Gorbachev's plan to remove nuclear-armed submarines from the Baltic Sea would not significantly change the balance of power between the Soviet bloc and NATO. American experts on military affairs said today that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plan to remove nuclear-armed submarines from the Baltic Sea would not significantly change the balance of power between the Soviet bloc and NATO. ''Mainly Gorbachev is seeking to gain political advantage from a cutback that the Soviets were engaged in anyway,'' said Raymond L. Garthoff of the Brookings Institution, a former Government official who has closely studied the Soviet armed forces. ''It's a favorable development, but does not represent a substantial new step or a big concession.'' Mr. Gorbachev, visiting Finland, said today that the Soviet Union had removed two Golf-class submarines and would destroy the four submarines of the same class remaining in the Baltic. Gene R. La Rocque, a retired rear admiral who serves as director of the Center for Defense Information, a research institute here, said the six submarines were platforms for firing nuclear-tipped missiles into Western Europe. He said their withdrawal ''does not mean a lot in military terms'' because the vessels were ''old dogs,'' built from 1958 to 1962. Litte Shift in Power Balance John M. Collins, senior specialist in national defense at the Congressional Research Service, said the submarines ''are being used as a substitute for land- and air-based theater nuclear weapons,'' which could be delivered by other means. Destruction of the submarines ''will not make any remarkable difference in the balance of power between NATO and the Warsaw Pact,'' he said. Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said the United States was not interested in Mr. Gorbachev's proposal to guarantee ''the nuclear-free status'' of the Baltic Sea. ''We do not believe nuclear-free zones contribute to security in Europe,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. ''Most of these proposals have been designed to affect NATO deterrence capability while leaving Soviet nuclear weapons intact. On the other hand, we do appreciate the intent of this, and if it can develop into something concrete, why, that might be a hopeful sign.'' Later Mr. Fitzwater said the United States opposed the concept of nuclear-free zones in Europe, or in waters surrounding Europe, because ''we think such zones do not make a real contribution to preserving European security and stability.'' 'Ancient, Rickety Machines' John F. Lehman Jr., who served as Secretary of the Navy from 1981 to 1987, said Mr. Gorbachev was making a political virtue of a military and fiscal necessity. For years, Mr. Lehman said, Soviet admirals have wanted to retire the Golf-class submarines because they are ''ancient, rickety machines that add almost nothing to the military equation and are very expensive to maintain.'' In addition, he said, ''every part of the Baltic can be reached by land-based nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union.'' Mr. Gorbachev said the Soviet Union had pulled back its tactical nuclear missiles so they could not strike northern Europe. 'What Is Northern Europe?' Mr. Collins of the Congressional Research Service raised two questions about that statement: ''How can we verify that it is true? And what is the definition of northern Europe?'' Mr. Collins said it was not clear whether Mr. Gorbachev was referring to countries on the northern flank of NATO, like Norway, or whether he was referring to countries north of the Alps, which would include West Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.",1989-10-27T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,world

Mr. Adamov, 58, a nuclear engineer, went to Teheran last month with Viktor N. Mikhailov, the minister who was ousted Monday, to meet with Iranian officials. Mr. Adamov later assured American officials that he had no intention of helping Iran develop nuclear weapons. But the trip still touched off concerns in Washington, which has been trying to restrict Russian nuclear cooperation of any sort with Iran. In a nation that has a huge nuclear weapons complex and heady plans to build civilian power reactors, the job of Atomic Energy Minister is of extraordinary importance. In the six years that he was minister, Mr. Mikhailov tried to finance his nuclear empire by selling reactors to Iran, India, China and Syria. His nuclear exports made him the bane of American policy makers, though he was also a partner in the quest to protect Russia's abundant supply of bomb materials, American officials say. His abrupt removal on Monday raised hopes that Russia's aggressive nuclear marketing might end. But the selection of Mr. Adamov is widely seen as an indication that Mr. Mikhailov's spirit will live on. Mr. Mikhailov, 64, made clear this week that he wanted Mr. Adamov as his successor. American officials describe Mr. Adamov as more polished than his predecessor. He speaks English and takes pride in the program on nuclear safety that he established at the Research and Development Institute of Power Engineering, the nuclear center in Moscow that he headed before being named minister. But the institute is best known as the father of the RBMK Chernobyl-style reactor. And while Western specialists consider such reactors dangerous and outmoded, Mr. Adamov wants to extend their operating life, not shut them down. As for nuclear exports, Mr. Adamov's recent trip to Iran raised American concerns that he wanted to sell it more reactors. His old institute has sold research reactors to Libya, North Korea and other countries. Pressed by American officials last week, Mr. Adamov said that no reactor sales were planned. President Boris N. Yeltsin has promised not to expand nuclear cooperation with Teheran beyond the reactor that Russia is building at Bushehr. The Russians insist that the Bushehr program is purely civilian, but the United States is concerned that any reactor could give Iran expertise that it could use in a bomb program. Despite their concerns, Western experts say that Mr. Adamov brings useful experience to his new post. He has cooperated with American efforts to tighten controls on nuclear material at his former institute. That institute is also involved in a American-financed program to develop a low-enriched fuel for research reactors, thereby rendering fuel unsuitable for bomb making. And the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 provided Mr. Adamov with experience in nuclear contamination. ''We find him to be very knowledgeable about the issues,'' Federico F. Pena, the United States Energy Secretary, said in a statement. He added, ''We are prepared to push forward immediately on our agenda of securing nuclear materials, improving nuclear safety and increasing scientific cooperation.'' But other American officials, who asked not to be identified, were more wary. They speculated that the replacement of Mr. Mikhailov had more to do with a power struggle within the Russian Government and allegations of corruption involving uranium sales than with policy. ''When Mikhailov was removed, there was some speculation that this was a positive signal that Russia might become more committed to nonproliferation,'' said one United States official. ''But Adamov was part of the team that went to Iran and is close to Mikhailov.'' Mr. Mikhailov is not leaving the scene altogether. When he was minister, he appointed himself the main scientific adviser at Arzamas-16, one of Russia's main nuclear weapons design centers. He held the two jobs simultaneously. Today Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin signed a decree affirming that Mr. Mikhailov would remain as the ministry's top scientific adviser, according to Georgi A. Kaurov, Mr. Mikhailov's press spokesman. ''Mikhailov will be in charge of science in the defense sphere while Adamov specializes in power production,'' Mr. Kaurov said.",1998-03-05T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,washington

If radiation were the color and texture of oil, there would be no operating reactors, because citizens would quickly realize that radiation releases occur routinely, not just in accidents. Yes, as you say, the country has to take steps to counteract the greenhouse effect and acid raid. And we agree that adding new oil-fired plants on Long Island is not the answer. But using nuclear power simply trades one environmental calamity for another. There are alternatives. If you had spent one-tenth the effort reporting recent, startling advances in photovoltaic technology that you have spent on cold fusion (for which, even if verified, practical applications are still decades away), your readers would know that solar power is no longer a dream. Indeed, researchers at Sandia National Laboratories have produced electricity from photovoltaics at an efficiency level comparable to oil or nuclear plants. This means that large-scale solar-power plants may be in place before the end of this century. And there is no more limitless source of energy than the sun. There is considerable progress on other energy fronts as well. For example, Brookhaven National Laboratories on Long Island is having success with methods of burning coal that do not produce carbon dioxide. The implementation of a meaningful energy-efficiency program on Long Island could meet capacity requirements cheaper and more quickly than either Shoreham or new oil-fired plants. There are plenty of scientists and engineers available to assist New York State in developing such a program. The nuclear industry would have us believe that our only choices are nuclear power or oil, coal and the greenhouse effect. That simply isn't true. Long Islanders already know that. Scrapping Shoreham isn't folly; indeed, it can be a strong step toward creating an environmentally sound energy future that does not leave a legacy of carbon dioxide or radioactive waste.

But down on the ground, the environmental problems of a quickly erected city built on sand look a lot less alluring. In the last year, tourists have swum amid raw sewage in Dubai’s slice of the Persian Gulf. The purifying of seawater to feed taps and fountains is raising salinity levels. And despite sitting on vast oil reserves, the region is running out of energy sources to support its rich lifestyle. The simple basics of waste treatment and providing fresh water, in addition to running major industrial projects, require so much electricity that the region is turning to a nuclear future, raising questions about the risks, both environmental and political, of relying in part on a technology vulnerable to accidents and terrorist attacks. Dazzled by Dubai’s rapid urbanization, other countries in the gulf are seeking to emulate it, especially as they prepare for a population boom. Dubai offers a cautionary tale in the pitfalls of building metropolises in the parched desert. “Growth has been so intense and enormous, but people forgot about the environment,” said Jean-François Seznec, a Middle East expert and professor at Georgetown University in Washington. “The attitude was, business comes first. Now, they are seeing increased problems, and they realize they have to be careful.” Like a Middle Eastern version of Las Vegas, Dubai’s biggest challenge is water, which may be everywhere in the gulf but is undrinkable without desalination plants. These produce emissions of carbon dioxide that have helped give Dubai and the other United Arab Emirates one of the world’s largest carbon footprints. They also generate enormous amounts of heated sludge, which is pumped back into the sea. The emirates desalinate the equivalent of four billion bottles of water a day. But their backups are thin: at any given time, the region has, on average, an estimated four-day supply of fresh water. Today, the gulf’s salinity levels have risen to 47,000 parts per million, from 32,000 about 30 years ago. That is enough, said Christophe Tourenq, a senior researcher at the World Wide Fund for Nature in Dubai, to threaten local fauna and marine life. Rapid growth has produced other problems as well, including sewage treatment operations that have struggled to keep up with development. Until last August, Dubai’s single waste treatment plant dealt with 480,000 cubic meters, or 17 million cubic feet, of sewage daily, nearly twice the 260,000-cubic-meter capacity it could properly handle, said Mohammed Abdulaziz Najem, the plant’s director. Some drivers of the 4,000 tankers that carried raw waste daily from Dubai to the treatment plant would simply dump their load down drains that flowed to the fashionable Jumeirah suburb, he said. Meanwhile, hundreds of skyscrapers were built with water and electricity as afterthoughts; environmental standards were rarely applied. Authorities acknowledge that the breakneck pace has stressed natural resources throughout the region. Efforts to achieve developed status within the next 20 years have “magnified” the challenges to environmental protection, Majid Al Mansouri, the secretary general of the Environment Agency of Abu Dhabi, said in an e-mail. “While we have achieved a great deal, we recognize that much more work remains.” Sustainability is now a big theme, and Abu Dhabi is trying to learn from Dubai’s mistakes. To tackle the water problem, Abu Dhabi has set up a groundwater monitoring system and is recycling by irrigating lawns and desert forests with residual waste. It has started a public awareness campaign. Last month, the government awarded contracts to start building the United Arab Emirates’ first water storage facility, which could hold a month’s worth of backup. The government has also started requiring new buildings to be designed using Western-style environmental standards that set goals for water and energy consumption, which Mr. Al Mansouri says his agency audits. Dubai also opened part of a large treatment facility this summer, doubling capacity. Moreover, after Dubai’s financial crisis hit, an estimated 400,000 laborers left, easing pressure on the treatment plants, which enjoy excess capacity for the first time, Mr. Najem said. But even these solutions face hurdles. Meanwhile, major industrial projects like aluminum smelting and steel production, which require large sources of electricity, are taxing the power grid. Many of these projects produce exports that supplement the emirates’ oil business and are also used to build infrastructure. But they are fueled by natural gas from Qatar, which limits supplies to the region. Alternates like solar energy and wind power are few and far between, while other solutions, like coal, are not viable because of transportation and supply challenges. As a result, the emirates are turning to nuclear power as a major new source of energy. The emirates signed an accord in December with Washington allowing countries to build nuclear plants that do not enrich or reprocess uranium. Abu Dhabi plans to build four plants by 2017 and to generate about 23 percent of the emirates’ power by 2020. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Egypt are also studying nuclear power. While desalination plants use less energy than the big industrial projects, Abu Dhabi is already planning to power some water treatment facilities by electricity from the emirates’ nuclear reactors. The buildup is developing as the administration of President Obama is trying to stop one of the emirates’ neighbors, Iran, from developing nuclear power, out of fear that it intends to build a nuclear weapon. But American officials say they see the emirates’ nuclear ambitions as a positive that could prod Iran along the same path of accepting proper safeguards. “The U.A.E. has demonstrated that this is how you would do it if you want nuclear power as a source of energy,” said a Western diplomat, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. But from a sustainability perspective, nuclear power makes little sense, said Mohamed Raouf, the environmental director at the Gulf Research Center. While it produces clean energy, “it’s not renewable, there’s a very big problem with waste, and uranium supplies are projected to run out in 40 to 50 years  around the same time as oil,” he said. “So there’s little logic unless you really want to develop it for political and security reasons.” Mohamed Al Hammadi, the chief executive of the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation who has worked with authorities to study ways to augment the emirates’ power needs, said the nuclear technology being used was “safe and peaceful by design.” Still, environmentalists fear that the governments are pursuing development in a pell-mell manner. “What the U.A.E. has showed us,” Mr. Raouf said, “is that if you don’t deal with the sustainability of the environment, you’ll achieve a quick profit but face hazards.”",2010-10-27T22:34:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

Soviet officials made the commitment at a meeting last week in Vienna of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the American official, Harold R. Denton, director of reactor regulation at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said today. While the Russians provided frustratingly few technical details of the Chernobyl disaster at the Vienna meeting, information gleaned from ''hall talk'' with Soviet officials confirmed earlier indications that the reactor was being used in experiments when the accident occurred, Mr. Denton said. Soviet officials have given no indication of what those experiments might have been. Some Western experts suspect that the reactor was being used to produce plutonium for weapons. Panel at Scientists Meeting Mr. Denton said today that American officials had not yet learned enough details about the design of the Chernobyl reactor, or about the events that led to its violent explosion, to judge whether the disaster held lessons for American reactors. Mr. Denton spoke on a panel on the implications of the Chernobyl accident at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. On the question of whether the stricken reactor had a containment structure to prevent the escape of radioactive materials in an accident, Mr. Denton said that based on incomplete information he believed that the reactor did not have a structure to provide containment of its core, as nearly all American nuclear plants do. He said a high priority would be getting more information about the reactor's containment systems. In the days after the accident at the Chernobyl reactor April 26, Federal officials and nuclear industry spokesmen said a similar accident could not occur in the United States because the Soviet reactor lacked basic safety systems, including a containment vessel of steel and concrete. Controversy on Defenses Experts have learned that the Chernobyl reactor had more defenses than previously assumed, apparently including walls of steel and concrete. Just what kinds of stresses the structure was designed to withstand and how Soviet safety procedures compare with those at American and European plants, have become matters of controversy and will probably remain so until the Russians provide more information, experts said. At the panel discussion today, Victor Gilinsky, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, warned against ''hubris about the differences'' between Soviet and American nuclear plants. He said some worrisome lessons for nuclear plants everywhere were already apparent. For example, he said, Soviet officials said the Chernobyl reactor was operating at low power at the time of the accident, and low power operation has generally been assumed to be safer than operation at full power. The speed with which the accident unfolded was also surprising, Mr. Gilinsky said. Many safety procedures have been based on the assumption that accidents will develop more slowly, allowing more time to respond, he said. Vienna Agency's Role Mr. Denton predicted that the International Atomic Energy Agency would play a stronger role as a clearing house for information on the spread of radioactive fallout from nuclear accidents and for information on nuclear safety. Up to now, the organization has worked chiefly to to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and to give technical aid on nuclear energy to those countries, mainly in the third world, that request it. Mr. Gilinsky warned that the agency was not likely to play a major role in nuclear safety regulation because it is ''a creature of its member governments,'' which retain sovereignty over their own actions. Also speaking on the panel was Gov. Dick Thornburgh of Pennsylvania, who had been Governor of the state only 72 days when the accident occurred at the Three Mile Island reactor in 1979. Governor Thornburgh said that during a visit to the Soviet Union eight months after the Three Mile Island accident, he was shocked to hear Soviet officials say they believed the safety of nuclear power was a ''solved problem.'' The Soviet officials had ''a decidedly 'pre-T.M.I.' mentality in what, for most of the rest of the world, had become the 'post-T.M.I.' era,'' Governor Thornburgh said. The Chernobyl disaster ''might never have happened if the people of the Soviet Union had been as free to question authorities after Three Mile Island as were the people of the United States,'' he said. After the Three Mile Island disaster, which was far less severe than the Chernobyl one, Federal authorities imposed new safety requirements, many requiring extra investments, on American nuclear plants. Rising public concern about nuclear safety led to new delays in construction and more temporary shutdowns of operating plants. These various repercussions of the Three Mile Island accident will add $130 billion to the cost of nuclear electricity in the United States between 1979 and 1992, in the calculation of Komanoff Energy Associates, a New York consulting firm.",1986-05-30T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world

They would form a single company to operate the thousands of miles of transmission lines now owned by the Authority or by the seven investor-owned utilities around the state and another entity to run the six nuclear reactors in the state. The proposal also called for the Power Authority to gradually reduce the amount of inexpensive hydroelectric power that it supplies to utilities upstate, and instead to use the electricity to lure job-producing industries there. It recommended using 2 percent of the revenues from hydroelectric projects to support ""renewable resources,"" like solar power, and for electric cars. It also called for severe budget cuts, especially at the authority's two nuclear reactors, which it said must be run more economically or shut down. The proposals, the result of a three-month study, were contained in a report to the Authority's trustees. The report was offered S. David Freeman, the authority's president and chief executive officer, who earned a reputation for dramatic solutions when he served as chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, and by Robert G. Schoenberger, the first executive vice president and chief operating officer. Harsh Words on Nuclear Some recommendations, like cutting budgets, could be carried out unilaterally by the Power Authority. Others, like cutting costs statewide by joint management of assets owned by for-profit utilities, would require the assent of those companies, which have always been limited in their cooperation. Still other recommendations would require new law. One area solely within the Authority's power is its two nuclear plants, which the report assessed in stark terms. ""The harsh truth is that at the moment, our rates don't cover our costs of producing nuclear power,"" Mr. Freeman and Mr. Schoenberger said. ""The Power Authority must either reduce costs and increase production at its nuclear power plants or shut them down,"" the report said. The Indian Point 3 plant, in Buchanan, N.Y., in Westchester Country, has been shut since early 1993 because of operating and management problems. Together with the adjacent Indian Point 2, owned by Consolidated Edison, the plant is at the center of a region more densely populated than any other reactor site in the United States. Its operation has been controversial for years. A 15-Percent Budget Cut The Authority's other reactor is the James A. FitzPatrick plant, in Scriba, near Oswego. It is adjacent to the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation's Nine Mile Point 1 and 2 reactors. The only other power reactor in the state, Rochester Gas and Electric's Robert E. Ginna plant, is near Rochester. The Authority's trustees received the report but took no action. They are scheduled to take it up at a meeting next Tuesday in Massena, at the St. Lawrence hydroelectric plant. The two executives called for cutting the authority's budget, now $487 million a year, by nearly 15 percent over the next 18 months. They would reduce reliance on contractors, reduce staff, cut the travel, legal and public affairs budgets, and take a variety of one-time steps, including selling the Thomas Hart Benton murals at the Niagara and St. Lawrence-F.D.R. visitors' centers. (The murals would fetch about $3 million in a gallery, the report estimated.) A major problem for the authority, according to Mr. Freeman, is that New York State has more electrical power than it needs, and the glut has cut prices. Unlike traditional utilities, the Authority does not have a service territory. It sells its power on the open market, and in some cases is having trouble competing. The report said that the Authority should do more than compete; it should promote clean-energy sources and energy conservation and stimulate the state's economy.",1994-06-23T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Gorbachev called on other nations today to join the Soviet Union in strengthening safeguards against nuclear disasters such as Chernobyl. In a message to Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar calling for an international convention on the subject, the Soviet leader also called for stronger measures to prevent acts of nuclear terrorism. ''It is quite obvious that there is a practical need to start, without delay, setting up an international regime for the safe development of nuclear energy,'' Mr. Gorbachev said. ''Such a regime would be aimed at bringing to an absolute minimum a possibility of the peaceful atom causing harm to people.'' Most important, he said, was ''a system of prompt notification in the event of accidents and malfunctions at atomic power plants when such occurrences are accompanied by the release of radiation.'' The Soviet Union was heavily criticized by many Western nations for providing too little information in the first days of the Chernobyl disaster, which began on April 26. Anti-Propaganda Provision In his message, Mr. Gorbachev also proposed that an international convention prohibit ''attempts to use nuclear accidents to exacerbate tensions and distrust in relations among states.'' In an address on Sovet television on May 14 in which he first mentioned the need for an international nuclear safeguard system, Mr. Gorbachev accused the West of using the Chernobyl accident for propaganda purposes. Mr. Gorbachev's message also concentrated on nuclear sabotage. ''There is an imminent need for an elaboration of a reliable system of measures to prevent nuclear terrorism in all its manifestations,'' he said. He expressed concern over ''the deficiency of measures for the prevention of thefts of highly enriched fissionable material'' and ''purposely inflicted damages to nuclear power enterprises, which have taken place in the West,'' citing 32 instances of sabotage against nuclear facilities he said have occurred in the United States between 1974 to 1984 and 10 such instances in Western Europe between 1966 to 1977. No listing of the purported incidents of nuclear sabotage was given, and there was no official comment from the State Department. A Farewell by Dubinin The message, delivered orally by chief Soviet delegate Yuri V. Dubinin in his farewell call to the Secretary General, was released in an unofficial translation by the United Nations. Mr. Dubinin is to become the Ambassador to the United States. Mr. Gorbachev suggested that a nuclear safeguard system be codified in one or more international conventions and that existing agencies like the International Atomic Energy Agency, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Environmental Program and the World Meteorological Organization be used to strengthen safety measures for nuclear reactors. Pending the conclusion of such a convention, he suggested that the International Atomic Energy Agency set up an early-notification system at its meeting later this month. The nuclear power agency could sponsor international efforts to develop ''a new generation of economical and reliable reactors with enhanced safety of operations compared to the existing reactors,'' as well as strengthening national and, where necessary, international controls to insure nuclear power safety, he said. Programs Already Proposed Some nuclear experts said Mr. Gorbachev's message may signal an improvement in the strained relationship between the Soviet Union and the International Atomic Energy Agency. ''I think they're serious about this,'' said Herbert Kouts, chiarman of the department of nuclear energy at Brookhaven National Laboratory. ''The Russian political structure has realized it will have to take into account things of a technical nature which it has never considered before.'' Some Reagan Administration officials, however, saw the Soviet leader's message as an attempt by Mr. Gorbachev to take credit for ideas originated elsewhere. At the Tokyo economic summit meeting in May, the leaders of the seven largest industrialized democracies called for a convention committing all parties ''to report and exchange information in the event of nuclear emergencies or accidents.'' In 1981, when the United States floated a similar proposal at the United Nations, it received little attention. In addition there is an international Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, which the United States and the Soviet Union have signed. That convention, which needs five signatories before it comes into effect, demands that states prosecute or extradite individuals who are involved in thefts, illegal transfers and threats involving nuclear material. United Nations officials pointed out that the 35-member board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency had already agreed at an emergency meeting in Vienna last month to seek binding conventions on measures that were similar to some of those proposed by Mr. Gorbachev.",1986-06-04T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world

The director general of the Russian Electric Power Company, touring the United States with a group of Russian nuclear officials, said in a recent interview that the enterprise is expected to run a deficit of $60 million this year, $200 million next year and $400 million the year after that. The company lacks money to pay workers, perform maintenance and repairs, inspect crucial pipes and even buy fuel, said the official, Sergei N. Ivanov. At times the plants have only two or three days of fuel on hand, he said. ''To prevent possible catastrophes in the field of nuclear power, we need to organize some kind of new international body that will supervise the work of this network, not only from the point of view of technical support, which is usual, but financial investment support,'' Mr. Ivanov said. The international group, he said, would manage the investments in the plants directly, rather than sending the funds through ''well-known Government thieves.'' Day-to-day operations would remain in Russian hands. The prospects for such investments seem uncertain at best. The proposal is another sign of the tremendous change in Russia, and in the nuclear industry that, through most of the post-Soviet era, was tightly linked to weapons production. While cash shortages are endemic throughout Russian business and industry, nuclear power officials point to the obvious fact that reactor problems in Russia could affect other nations. They argue, therefore, that other nations, including the United States, should help find solutions. One anticipated difficulty is that Mr. Ivanov would like to use some of the foreign investment money to complete three partly built reactors -- one of which has the same design as the reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine, scene of the 1986 explosion and fire. Two others are similar to Westinghouse plants in the United States. ''They're in a state of intense desperation,'' said Stephen Kotkin, director of Russian studies at Princeton University. He met with Mr. Ivanov and other Russians when the delegation visited a conference on the world economy last month at the Milken Institute, a research organization in Santa Monica, Calif. ''They have some knowledge of market economies and they have a fantasy that outsiders will invest,'' said Professor Kotkin. ''Equity interest, bonds -- they'll go for anything. Everything is negotiable.'' ''Without some help, though,'' Professor Kotkin said, ''this is going to blow.'' Clinton Administration officials said the effort seemed highly preliminary. One Administration expert said the Russians have little of the data they would need to interest Western investors -- including estimates of their costs. They also lack clear prospects of selling power to customers who can pay cash that, in turn, could be used to repay loans or provide dividends on investments. In addition, groups in the United States that usually oppose operation of nuclear reactors in this country have argued that giving aid to improve safety at Russian plants may only prolong the lives of those plants, when it would be even safer to let the plants be closed. The idea of spending Western money to build additional reactors in Russia, especially a graphite-moderated model like the one that exploded at Chernobyl, would be extremely unpopular with some groups. The unfinished graphite reactor is at Kursk; there are unfinished water-moderated reactors, similar in outline to American models, at Kalinin and Rostov. A Russian delegation -- which includes the director of the company that owns the non-nuclear generating stations and the transmission network and the director of the agency that regulates nuclear safety -- has been meeting with Government and private officials in Los Angeles and New York. The Russian problem, say members of the delegation and Americans who have studied the Russian situation, is in part the structure of their electric industry, which has many inefficient plants. But, on top of that, only 30 percent to 40 percent of electric bills are paid in currency. The rest is paid in barter goods, priced by the producer, often at unrealistically high values. The money goes to provincial utilities and to the Unified Energy System of Russia, which owns the nonnuclear generating stations and the transmission lines. Unified Energy spends much of the money on natural gas and coal to fuel its own plants, because miners and drillers can demand money or export their product to other countries that will pay in hard currency, American analysts say. But the nuclear power company has no such leverage. The nuclear power company receives only about 10 percent of its payments in currency, said one American official. Another 60 percent or so is barter, and some of the bills simply go unpaid. Mr. Ivanov confirmed this. He said that industrial customers tend to offer whatever they produce as payment -- steel, chemicals or manufactured goods -- but that others, like hospitals and army bases, offer nothing at all. One Clinton Administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said many of the Russian plants are approaching the end of their 30-year design lives and show symptoms of age. The Russian company would like to close nine of its older reactors, but it says it has no money for decommissioning them. It says its best prospect for earning that money is to build additional reactors and sell the power.",1999-04-12T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

The company is still in the throes of wrenching operational changes since its merger in 1990 with the Utah Power and Light Company. Mr. Lorenzini, 49, who is now executive vice president for operations for the Portland, Ore., utility, replaces Robert Moench, who is retiring. His promotion is part of a management restructuring by the parent company, Pacificorp, to pave a smooth transition for the utility, which is trying to reduce costs and keep power prices low. ""It has been very difficult to merge two company cultures,"" Mr. Lorenzini said. ""People get used to doing business in different ways and have spent their entire careers working for either Pacific Power or Utah Power. We've needed to devise processes to merge operations such as accounting, economic development and even generating and transmission resources."" Mr. Lorenzini grew up in Portland and as a youth worked at Whizburger, a fast-food chain that sold 19-cent hamburgers when it was founded in the 1960's by his father, Gilbert. Once while hitchhiking to school, he was offered a ride by a naval officer who suggested he get a degree from one of the nation's military academies. As a result of that chance meeting, in 1964, he graduated from the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, L.I. An instructor who taught a course in nuclear physics ""made nuclear engineering sound fascinating,"" and in 1969 he received a doctorate in the field from Oregon State University in Corvallis. He received a law degree in 1975 from Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. From 1969 to 1976, he was employed as a nuclear engineer at Rockwell International in Los Angeles. While working at Rockwell, he was co-chairman of a committee formed to defeat an antinuclear initiative, Proposition 15. In 1976, he joined the law firm of Tooze, Kerr, Peterson, Marshall & Shenker in Portland. In 1979 he joined the Rockwell Hanford Operation, Richland, Wash., and in 1984 was named vice president and general manager, responsible for a staff of 5,000 and radioactive waste management from nuclear operations there. He joined Pacific Power in 1987. ""I'm pretty happy where I am now and welcome challenges,"" he said. ""But one thing I've learned is that I don't plan my life too far in advance.""

With help from a refrigerant chemical found in large air-conditioning systems, researchers at a California company have designed what they describe as a small nuclear power plant that has an inherent tendency to avoid reactor meltdowns. Developed by General Atomics, an energy research company in San Diego, the plant is a variation on the small research reactors used at some universities to produce nuclear isotopes for research purposes. The new plant, which could be used as an alternative to diesel generators, would be capable of producing 10 million watts of electric power, General Atomics said. ''It's a power source for remote or isolated locations that does not require a lot of training or sophistication to operate,'' said Robert Schleicher, manager of power reactor development at General Atomics. The research reactors, which General Atomics markets under the name of Triga, burn a fuel made of uranium-zirconium-hydride. They have an inherent tendency to resist meltdown, Mr. Schleicher said, because the hydride component becomes ineffective at the extremely high temperatures associated with a breakdown in the cooling system and blocks nuclear fission. If the coolant surrounding the reactor core stops flowing, therefore, the reaction comes to a halt. But precisely for that reason, Triga reactors have been impractical for generating power. Power plants require a reactor to produce substantial heat, which is used to generate steam that turns turbines and produces electricity. New Coolant Used The new reactor would resolve the problem by replacing the water used as a coolant in most reactors with a commercial refrigerant called R-114. This coolant does not boil, as water does. But under relatively low temperature and pressure, it changes into a state somewhere between a gas and a liquid, and can turn turbines in much the same way as steam. To further reduce the risk of a meltdown, the engineers designed cooling pipes to circulate liquid using the natural force of convection. That is, as the liquid becomes hotter it tends to rise. As a result, Mr. Schleicher said, the pipes can remove the afterheat of a nuclear reactor core even if electric pumps have failed. At current prices, however, the plant's electricity costs more than that produced by diesel fuel and has not attracted customers. Mr. Schleicher and three engineers, Jack S. Yampolsky, Leonardo Cavallaro and Kenneth F. Paulovich, received patent 4,863,675.",1989-09-09T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,technology

The decision by the authorities in Kagoshima Prefecture, on the southern island of Kyushu, cleared an important obstacle to restarting the reactors, which were declared safe by Japan’s new nuclear regulatory agency in September but have been awaiting the go-ahead from politicians. Japan’s 48 operable commercial reactors have been caught in a seesawing debate over safety since the triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station in March 2011, and none are currently producing power. The two reactors in Kagoshima, at the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant, would be the first to be brought back online under safety standards introduced last year. A restart at Sendai would smooth the way for others around the country. Electric utilities are seeking safety certifications for 20 reactors at 13 plants, less than half the number that were in operation before Fukushima. Others are considered too old to upgrade, or are too close to the disaster zone, in the country’s northeast, to be politically acceptable. Tens of thousands of Fukushima residents remain unable to return home. The nuclear debate has been notable for confusion over who, ultimately, must make the decision about whether to turn reactors back on. Delays have multiplied as a result. After the regulatory agency certified the Sendai reactors, many analysts said they could be back online in a month; now the prognosis is for early next year. In Kagoshima, politicians have mostly been sympathetic to the industry, as have leaders in many other areas with nuclear plants. These areas are often relatively poor and depend on the jobs and subsidies that come with them. The national government, led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, is also openly pro-nuclear. Yet with the public still anxious about safety, leaders at all levels have sought to shift the final say elsewhere. Japanese law does not give any one elected body outright control over nuclear plants, which are operated by private companies. “This is an important decision and a big step toward restarting the power plant,” said Yoichi Miyazawa, the industry ministe. He had flown to Kagoshima earlier this week to meet with prefectural leaders and press the case for allowing Sendai’s operations to resume. Kagoshima’s governor, Yuichiro Ito, said he had “no choice” but to endorse resuming operations at the Sendai plant, since the prefectural assembly had voted in favor of a restart resolution earlier Friday. The resolution had been submitted by private citizens groups, led by local businesses. The assembly, for its part, was harshly critical of Mr. Abe’s government for what it called a lack of leadership on the issue. The prime minister has not made a forceful case to the public for bringing plants back online, assembly members believe, instead deferring to local politicians, who lack the expertise and resources to verify the plants’ safety on their own. “The national government’s involvement in the restart process has been inadequate, and has left local authorities with a large and difficult burden,” the assembly said in its resolution. Sendai’s restart could still be delayed by court challenges. Dozens of lawsuits have been filed against power companies that want to turn plants back on, though most that have reached the decision stage have been rejected by judges. In an exception in May, antinuclear groups won an injunction against a plant in western Japan, though its owner is appealing the ruling. Suits have been filed by antinuclear activists as well as the local authorities in areas that are close to nuclear plants. Opposition in such neighboring areas is particularly strong: They could be exposed to radiation or evacuation orders during a serious accident, yet they do not receive the subsidies and other economic benefits that go to towns that host nuclear plants.",2014-11-07T12:59:24.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The resignations came just days after Japanese regulators opened an investigation of the country's nuclear power producers. The scandal is the latest in a series involving corporate malfeasance and lax government oversight and is one of the gravest because the utility, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, is a pillar of the business sector. The findings may also slow the development of a new fuel -- called mixed-oxide fuel, or MOX -- that the government and several utilities have been promoting. Tokyo Electric Power had been testing the material at its installations, but government inspections, which began today, will force the company to halt the tests as it shuts down five reactors temporarily. In announcing his and other departures, the Tokyo Electric Power's president, Nobuya Minami, conceded that his employees had hidden evidence and falsified 29 reports that included records of cracks in eight of the company's reactors. Nuclear regulators and the company said the cracks did not pose an immediate safety threat. The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency ordered other utilities to check for cracks and other problems similar to the ones found at Tokyo Electric Power. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and his ministers, angered by the reports, called on the power company to take responsibility for its actions. Akira Kawate, deputy governor of Fukushima prefecture, where two of Tokyo Electric's plants are situated, also expressed anger. The problem became known when General Electric International Inc., a subsidiary of General Electric Company ,was hired to inspect Tokyo Electric Power's reactors. It told Tokyo Electric Power it had found that some safety documents might have been falsified. Several local news organizations also suggested that General Electric International employees told regulators about the problems two years ago, though it is not clear why the problem was not publicly disclosed then. Tokyo Electric Power's cover-up may have gone back as far as 1986 and continued through the mid-1990's, involving about 100 workers, Kyodo News reported. The government will release a report of its findings in mid-September. The turmoil is another setback for the government's program to develop the new fuel, which is made by mixing plutonium with uranium. In July, another Japanese utility returned a shipment of defective mixed-oxide fuel from Britain. The British company reportedly also falsified safety documents. Public protests ensued and will probably follow this time, experts said. Kiyoshi Sakurai, an independent analyst formerly affiliated with Japan's Nuclear Power Research Institute, said the fuel program was sure to be delayed, adding, ''The electric companies have completely damaged the trust of the citizens.'' Still, the government supports production of the fuel to reduce the country's dependence on oil, all of which must be imported. Japan has more than four dozen nuclear reactors, which generate about 30 percent of the country's electricity. Mr. Minami will step down in October as president of Tokyo Electric Power as well as from his posts as chairman of the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan and deputy leader of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives. The utility's chairman and three other executives will leave their posts this month.",2002-09-03T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

He was 63. The cause was pancreatic cancer, his wife, Tetyana Murza, said. As executive director and president of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service in Takoma Park, Md., for three decades, Mr. Mariotte was at the forefront of two successful landmark efforts: to prevent the repeal of a federal ban on interstate shipment of radioactive waste, and to bar the construction of new nuclear plants in Maryland and Louisiana. He also organized antinuclear campaigns in Eastern Europe after the fatal power plant catastrophe in 1986 at Chernobyl, in what was then the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. And his information service acted as a clearinghouse for groups that opposed nuclear power, both in the United States and overseas. In 2014, Mr. Mariotte (pronounced like the hotel chain) received a lifetime achievement award from Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, on behalf of a dozen environmental groups, including Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, Public Citizen and the Sierra Club. He had earlier been a co-founder of an alternative weekly newspaper in the nation’s capital, which became Washington City Paper , as well as a drummer in a punk-rock band. Michael Lee Mariotte was born in Indianapolis on Dec. 9, 1952, to Richard Mariotte, a civilian employee of the Defense Department, and the former Rozetta Mae Dorton, who had worked for a hotel in Hilton Head, S.C., and for an employment agency. He moved to the Washington area when he was 13 and graduated from Herndon High School in Fairfax County, Va. Mr. Mariotte graduated from Antioch College in Ohio in 1978. His marriage to Lynn Thorp ended in divorce. He is survived by their children, Nicole and Richard Mariotte; his children with Ms. Murza, Zoryana and Kateryna; a sister, Julie Mariotte; and a brother, Jeffrey. When he was a young man, Mr. Mariotte and housemates from Virginia formed the band Tru Fax and the Insaniacs , which began playing at local clubs in 1978 and produced an album in 1982. The band continued to perform occasionally until recently (and impishly relished the title of Washington’s worst band, bestowed in 1980 by Washingtonian magazine). Mr. Mariotte was also the founding editor and later general manager of the alternative newspaper 1981, which was renamed Washington City Paper a year later. He joined the Nuclear Information and Resource Service in 1985, became executive director the next year and began publishing a newsletter called Groundswell, now known as Nuclear Monitor. The organization mobilized antinuclear groups, testified before Congress and enlisted celebrity endorsements. Notably, it helped defeat a proposed reactor in Calvert Cliffs, Md.; a uranium processing plant in Louisiana; and legislation that would have lifted curbs on the transportation of radioactive waste. Mr. Mariotte said the measure had posed the threat of a “mobile Chernobyl.” He resigned as executive director at the end of 2013 because of his illness. He was subsequently named president and ran the organization’s website, its GreenWorld blog and other programs. Mr. Mariotte remained convinced that nuclear power would become obsolete and be replaced by clean, renewable energy sources and greater energy efficiency. “It is no longer a question of whether these 21st-century technologies can replace nuclear power and fossil fuels,” he said when he stepped down as executive director of the information service. “The question is when.”",2016-05-24T03:41:40.000+02:00,NYTIMES,national-u.s.

Mr. Rattner pulled a driver from a burning gasoline truck last year, risking his life and earning an invitation to a ''Heroes Breakfast'' at the Hilton Rye Town last week. But when it came time to smile and accept his plaque, he pulled a Marlon Brando and refused it, saying he could not allow himself to be a public relations tool of one of the day's corporate sponsors, Entergy Nuclear Northeast, which owns the Indian Point power plant. Mr. Rattner says Indian Point is a menace that should be shut down. Mr. Rattner, an electrical contractor from Irvington, thus fired an early shot in what promises to be a long and ferocious struggle over the relicensing of Indian Point, the Hudson Valley's vital energy resource or nuclear nightmare -- take your pick -- in Buchanan, about 35 miles north of Times Square. Already the environmentalists are out in force, firing away with news conferences and op-eds and calling in reinforcements from the hundreds of politicians and dozens of town and village boards that have called for the plant to be decommissioned. Besides traditional anxieties about meltdown, radioactive waste and the nuclear industry's wobbly economics, the enemies of Indian Point have a new trump card to play -- the fear of terrorism -- now that 9/11 has jolted people into taking long-shot possibilities seriously. Supporters of nuclear power have a trump card of their own: global warming, which looms as the environmental crisis of our age. This has prompted more than a few people in the green camp to argue that fossil fuel, not radiation, is the clear and present danger, and to embrace nuclear plants as a proven, readily available way to reduce carbon emissions and save the planet. This page has been largely agnostic about nuclear power in general and Indian Point in particular, though it has expressed serious reservations about security at the plant, which is badly placed in a densely populated region, where a mass evacuation in an emergency would be extremely difficult. We have called for greater fortifications and a competent security force at Indian Point, but have seen no immediate reason to shut it down. We hope the coming clashes will clarify what the region's residents think about whether to embrace or reject nuclear power along the Hudson. We hope further that this grappling will lay the groundwork for a much broader debate -- the kind of national discussion the Bush administration should be leading but is not, given that its energy policies amount to little more than an unwavering fixation on the maximal extraction and consumption of fossil fuels from anywhere and everywhere. It may seem early in Westchester --Indian Point's reactor licenses are not up for renewal until 2013. But Indian Point is one of the biggest nuclear controversies around, aside from the long struggle over burying waste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, and thus is a prime opportunity to sort out our energy priorities, reassess our seemingly boundless appetite for cheap power and weigh our tolerance for risk -- not just in the region, but across the nation.

Reactor,"Members of Congress complained today that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had approved plans to restart a repaired power reactor at the Tennessee Valley Authority while knowing that safety questions remained unresolved. Members of Congress complained today that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had approved plans to restart a repaired power reactor at the Tennessee Valley Authority while knowing that safety questions remained unresolved. They also said the Justice Department was still investigating the T.V.A. nuclear power director on suspicion of lying about safety conditions at the system's five nuclear reactors, which have been closed for safety reasons. At a daylong hearing before the investigating subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Representative John D. Dingell, its chairman, criticized Steven A. White, a retired Navy admiral who was brought in by the T.V.A. in 1986 to salvage its long-plagued nuclear operation. The criticism was so sharp that another committee member, Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee, demanded to know whether Mr. Dingell wanted Mr. White dismissed. An Aggressive Exchange Mr. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, declined to answer directly, saying he was reserving judgement ''until all the facts are in.'' But he quickly added, ''I would not have appointed him.'' In an aggressive exchange with Lando W. Zech Jr., the chairman of the nuclear agency, over Mr. White's role in the T.V.A.'s nuclear operations, Mr. Dingell characterized Mr. White as either ''an incompetent'' or ''a rascal.'' ''Which do you want, the incompetent bumpkin or the outright knave running our nuclear plants?'' Mr. Dingell demanded of Mr. Zech. ''There is a high probability that you have both.'' At Mr. White's office in Chattanooga, Tenn., Kay Whitenburg, a spokeswoman, said he was traveling today and had no immediate response. This was the fourth recent public hearing on the widely criticized laxity of the nuclear agency's oversight of the T.V.A. nuclear program. The main issue today was the commission's unanimous approval on March 22 of the restart of Sequoyah Unit 2, a nuclear reactor near Chattanooga. Old and New Deficiencies The five-member commission was clearly determined to allow the T.V.A. to start up Sequoyah, which was closed for safety reasons in 1985. But it had to postpone three earlier announced restart votes as new deficiencies were found at Sequoyah or old ones were found to have been uncorrected. Under questioning today, nuclear agency officials testified that even as the restart vote was cast they knew that Sequoyah was so short of fire protection requirements that it required a waiver. The reactor's emergency diesel generators, a standby power source, also would not meet the agency's standards, officials conceded today, and were granted waivers. Questions about whether Mr. White falsified a sworn statement to the agency in 1986 on the status of another T.V.A. reactor at Watts Bar, near Knoxville, Tenn., are also having repercussions in the Sequoyah controversy. Testimony today disclosed that at a meeting of the nuclear agency on March 21, the day before the agency voted to approve the restart of Sequoyah, an official recommended that Mr. White be removed from office. In a transcript of the meeting released by the committee, Jane Axelrad, deputy director of a nuclear agency group assigned to monitor the T.V.A. recovery program, said the agency had ''not previously seen a pattern of conduct'' like Mr. White's, ''in which a key licensing manager has provided false information to the N.R.C. in six instances over a year-and-a-half period.'' ''Even if the commission does not agree that the false information was provided deliberately,'' Ms. Axelrad said, ''it is my personal view that this pattern of conduct warrants Mr. White's removal.''

Iran has a stockpile of nearly 300 kilograms of uranium enriched up to 20 percent, which it says is needed to power a reactor in Tehran, but analysts say Iran has produced enough fuel to last years. Last week Hossein Naqavi Hosseini, a lawmaker who is the deputy head of the national security and foreign policy committee, announced that the country had stopped enriching uranium up to 20 percent, telling Icana that “the site has the required fuel at the moment and there is no need for more production.” The remarks by Mr. Hosseini were seen as a possible indication that Iran was willing to compromise over its enriched uranium stockpile in negotiations with the big powers over the country’s disputed nuclear program, which the West says is a guise for reaching the capability to make nuclear weapons. Iran says its activities are purely peaceful. Mr. Hosseini later said he had been misquoted but did not specify how. The committee’s chairman, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, denied Iran had ceased production. While Mr. Salehi was correcting Mr. Hosseini, Mr. Salehi was corrected concerning another matter on Wednesday by the minister of intelligence, Mahmoud Alavi. He said Mr. Salehi’s recent claims that four “nuclear saboteurs” had been arrested after they tried to steal nuclear secrets from a power plant were inaccurate. Mr. Alavi said the four suspects had been seeking scrap metal, according to the semiofficial Islamic Students’ News Agency. The men had dug a hole under a fence around the power plant in order to sneak the purloined scrap metal out and sell it, he said. “These people were thieves, not nuclear saboteurs,” the minister said. “They were from a village close to the power plant, and they had done such things before.”",2013-10-30T20:13:55.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-middle-east

And the chief F.B.I. agent in New York City and the Police Commissioner said yesterday that the city should tighten security in public buildings, with underground garages installing video cameras to identify drivers and skyscrapers tightening security standards. The Police Commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, asked the public to be patient when bomb precautions are taken, adding: ""We cannot live in a bunker mentality. We have to survive as a city."" He spoke yesterday with James Fox, the director of New York F.B.I. office, at a State Senate Investigations Committee hearing. Mr. Fox and Mr. Kelly did not spell out what kind of security steps should be taken except to say that public access to public buildings and tourist sites must be restricted. After the state hearing, Mr. Kelly said the letter, which the Federal Bureau of Investigation says came from one of the suspects in the bombing, ""will be used in the prosecution of the case."" The letter claimed responsibility for the Feb. 26 attack in the name of the ""Liberation Army Fifth Battalion"" and protested American aid to Israel. Mr. Kelly said that in addition to the letter, which was sent to The New York Times several days after the blast, ""there were other letters and notes received and we are in the process of checking their credibility."" None of the other letters or notes ""to my knowledge have been connected"" to the bombing, he said. The state hearing was held as interest increased in a Federal study of whether nuclear power plants are vulnerable to car or truck bombs. The N.R.C. has been evaluating security at reactors since shortly after the blast. The commission is reviewing its requirements for civilian power plants, which currently call for preparation for a commando-style attack by terrorists, but only those with hand-carried weapons. Experts eschew detail, but several said that the biggest explosive the plants are designed to withstand is a bazooka shell. The chairman of the N.R.C., Ivan Selin, said the reasoning for the last few years has been that there is no history of people breaking into operating power plants, that the United States does not have a problem with truck bombs and that no serious threats against power plants had been made by terrorists. On Feb. 7, however, a former mental patient drove his station wagon past the guard shack at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant near Harrisburg, Pa., and crashed it through a metal door. Soon after the World Trade Center bombing, the N.R.C., prodded by a private Washington-based anti-proliferation group called the Nuclear Control Institute, among others, agreed to re-evaluate its assumptions. A spokesman for the Commission, Joseph J. Fouchard, said yesterday that the letter ""certainly got our attention."" The re-evaluation will involve consultation by N.R.C. engineers with intelligence agencies and an evaluation of bomb vulnerability by a consultant, he said. There is no schedule. 'Chilling Reading' Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who conducted a hearing with the N.R.C. on March 19 about the vulnerability of the plants, said yesterday that the letter linked to the bombing was ""chilling reading."" ""The term 'Nuclear targets"" is not an absolutely clear term,"" he said. But he added: ""Everything we know about terrorists tells us they strike not at hard targets but soft targets, and the nuclear weapons facilities are among the most protected sites in America. Nuclear power plants are not sufficiently protected, and I presume that they were talking about a nuclear power plant."" Law enforcement officials also said yesterday that they had ""physical"" evidence conclusively linking the letter sent to The Times to at least one of the four main bombing suspects. Interviewed last night on Channel 1, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, who has previously denied any involvement in the World Trade Center bombing, said, ""I don't know anything about the letter."" Risk of Attack Played Down The Times, which published the letter on Sunday, gave it to New York City police early this month. One official said yesterday that the evidence tying the suspects to the letter came only after other breaks in the case had led to arrests. The officials said it was clear that at least one of the four main bombing suspects had written the letter, but that the nature of the evidence left open the possibility that several may have been involved in its preparation.",1993-03-30T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission today put off a decision that would have cleared the way for the start of limited operations at the Seabrook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire. Lando W. Zech Jr., chairman of the commission, said he and other members of the commission had not had enough time to read an emergency plan submitted Wednesday by the plant's owners, a consortium of utilities. The plan covers adjacent areas of Massachusetts that fall within the 10-mile zone that would have to be evacuated if a radiation leak occurred. ''My view,'' Mr. Zech said, ''is that we should take the time to make sure the plan is in existence and is reasonable.'' He said he expected that to be accomplished by May 1. The commission does not have to approve the plan to award a license to test the plant at up to 5 percent of full power. But once testing begins, parts of the plant will become contaminated by radiation and the cost of abandoning it will rise by many millions of dollars. That additional cost, Seabrook's opponents fear, may be a factor when the commission makes its final decision on whether to grant the $4.56 billion plant a license for full-power operations.",1987-04-10T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

The decision not to proceed with the plant in Guangdong Province, less than 60 miles from Hong Kong, came after hundreds of people turned out on Friday and “took a walk” through the city of Jiangmen carrying banners showing their opposition to the proposed plant, which would have been capable of processing half the fuel needed for China’s nuclear power needs. Unsanctioned gatherings are banned in China, but participants said the police did not intervene to stop the protest. The Jiangmen City government Web site said Saturday that the project had been “canceled,” and Southern Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party in Guangdong, said the decision was made “out of respect for public opinion.” The protest in Jiangmen was the latest display of growing public disquiet about environmental hazards, which could frustrate China’s ambitious plans for nuclear power and technology. The catastrophic failures at nuclear power plants in Fukushima, Japan, in 2011, also kindled anxiety in China about its expansion of nuclear power. That expansion is a major part of China’s plans to decrease the reliance on coal, and the government has indicated that by 2020 it wants nuclear reactors to provide about 5 percent or more of the country’s power, up from about 2 percent now. The government has also faced a widespread public outcry over the air pollution enshrouding Beijing and many other major Chinese cities, forcing officials to begin instituting a series of measures to try to control emissions. Word of the planned protest against the proposed Guangdong plant had spread rapidly in recent days on Chinese social media despite government efforts to censor the discussion on Sina Weibo, China’s version of Twitter. Opponents were also planning another protest for Sunday. Some opponents were outraged the public was given only 10 days to comment on the plans, while others said they were upset that the public had no apparent role in deciding where the plant would be located.",2013-07-13T06:53:07.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

For the Japanese government and the local power company here, the 18,000-mile voyage to return a load of defective fuel to a British supplier, was intended to close a scandal that badly hurt the Japanese nuclear power industry. But for international environmental groups, Pacific island nations and some members of the United States Congress, the shipment opens a more dangerous chapter, involving the ocean transport under what they call weak security of raw materials that could be used for nuclear arms. The ship that set out from here today, the Pacific Pintail, which cruises at the leisurely speed of about 13 knots, relies for protection on several deck-mounted 30-millimeter machine guns. The ship will be joined at sea by a similarly equipped companion vessel. Security on board each ship is provided by 13 veterans of the British special services, employed by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority Constabulary. ''These ships are among the safest that travel on the seas, with double hulls, buoyancy tanks, satellite navigation systems and double the crew they need,'' a spokesman for British Nuclear Fuels Limited, which operates the ship and supplied the faulty fuel to Japan, told Reuters. Critics of the operation point out, however, that the first shipments of reprocessed fuels from Europe to Japan, in the mid-1980's, were made under official naval escort that was provided by the United States, Britain and France. At a minimum, they say, in the post-Sept. 11 environment, cargos this deadly should have defenses guided by radar, to shield them from attack by small aircraft or fast boats. ''I have written to the State Department and expressed my concerns to the Pentagon,'' said Robert A. Underwood, Guam's delegate to the House of Representatives. ''The State Department sent some people over who are responsible for nuclear safety, and said they have looked into the possibility of the ship leaking. ''Our bigger concern, though, is security, given the state of the world we are in,'' he said. ''This is nuclear weapons grade fuel, and we would like to know, what will happen if there is a threat?'' Environmental activists fear that today's shipment will set a standard for the security of what could be dozens of similar shipments of reprocessed fuels from Britain to Japan, which would create a huge temptation to international terrorist groups. According to Greenpeace, the Japanese government has well over 33 tons of separated plutonium stockpiled in Britain and France, and it is intent on having European companies mix these stocks with uranium for burning in nuclear power plants here. Japan has repeatedly confirmed its commitment to using reprocessed fuel from Europe for its nuclear industry. The government has made no comment about the current shipment. The forms a threat might take were already spelled out in a critique of flaws in maritime security involving plutonium shipments, written six years ago by experts from Sandia National Laboratories, in conjunction with the Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore laboratories, the United States' three premier weapons laboratories. The report warned against risks from the seizure of the plutonium cargo aboard a lightly armed ship, to a devastating attack using high explosives, which would create the equivalent of a huge dirty bomb at sea. Wary of such a threat, South Korea today reportedly asked Japan not to allow the ships sailing today to enter the narrow strait just off Pusan that separates the two countries. Officials in many South Pacific countries, through whose waters the plutonium cargo ships are likely to transit, also fear that the vessels could be sabotaged en route. Kansai Electric, one of Japan's largest producers of nuclear energy and the operator of the reactor here that is returning the faulty plutonium fuel, would not say what route the ship planned to chart to Britain. Its destination is Barrow-in-Furness, the industrial port in northwestern England, where British Nuclear Fuels Limited, or BNFL, as the company is known, will receive the fuel. Governments in this region are particularly nervous after recent intelligence reports from the United States and Morocco that groups with links to Al Qaeda had discussed plans to use small, high-speed boats to attack Western naval vessels. These reports warned of sabotage plans centered near the Strait of Gibraltar. A similar attack using a small boat damaged the American destroyer Cole in the port city of Aden, Yemen, in October 2000. ''We are not informed about such things,'' said Tatsuya Kawabe, a spokesman for Kansai Electric. ''All I can say is that security today is equal to the security when this shipment first arrived.'' Today's shipment is the result of a major blunder, followed by an attempted cover-up, at BNFL, a troubled state-owned British nuclear fuels reprocessing company. In 1999, using a similar maritime security detail, BNFL shipped a cargo of fuel of mixed uranium and plutonium oxide, known as Mox, to Japan for use in a Kansai Electric reactor here. The fuel, which is encased in ceramic pellets, must be milled to meet highly exacting standards. But after delivery here, it was discovered that many of the required quality controls had been fraudulently certified. Japan depends almost entirely on BNFL, as well as one other French contractor, to reprocess its nuclear reactor wastes, from which plutonium is derived. Japan has virtually no oil or uranium reserves, and little coal. Recovering plutonium from spent reactor rods to mix with Japan's scarce uranium is a practice that is universally endorsed within government and power industry circles. The scandal over BNFL's falsely certified fuel, however, enraged citizens groups and helped put the Japanese nuclear power industry on the defensive. Activists opposed to nuclear power have used the issue, along with a spate of recent accidents in Japanese plants, to mobilize public opinion against the import of hybrid nuclear fuels from overseas. Referendums in some areas have prohibited use of the mixed fuel. The recent uproar over the terrorist risk to nuclear shipments has only increased the pressure on Japan's nuclear industry to reconsider its mixed fuel program. ''As of now, we have no plans for a return shipment from BNFL,'' said Satoshi Azumi, manager for nuclear fuel engineering at Kansai Electric. ''BNFL destroyed the trust between us, and until their reputation is restored and the people can trust them, there are no plans to buy more Mox pellets from them.'' However, the Kansai spokesman, Mr. Kawabe, said resuming use of the hybrid fuels, which implies resuming transoceanic plutonium shipments, was only a matter of time. ''Plutonium recycling is a basic part of our energy security,'' Mr. Kawabe said. ''It is inevitable.'' Several dozen protesters who gathered noisily here to denounce the mixed fuel program, however, vowed to stop the shipments. ''The Mox program was started with no discussion with the people,'' said Miwako Ogiso, secretary general of the Council of People of Fukui Prefecture against Nuclear Power. ''The shipment of fuel around the globe like this is not at all safe.'' Correction: July 9, 2002, Tuesday A map on Friday with an article about the shipment of 550 pounds of nuclear fuel from Japan to Britain showed an erroneous location for the port town where the cargo began its 18,000-mile voyage.

A review board of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission today rejected a request by the operators of the Seabrook nuclear power reactor to reduce the mandatory 10-mile emergency evacuation zone around the New Hampshire plant to a radius of one mile. The request for the special Seabrook waiver was filed last December by the Public Service Company of New Hampshire. The plant's operation is opposed by Massachusetts towns two miles south of the reactor site. The towns and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts have kept the plant's operators from obtaining a nuclear commission license to operate at full power by refusing to join in planning for the 10-mile evacuation plan required by commission rules. The agency's rejection of the one-mile alternative proposal came in a 33-page opinion from a hearing panel, or atomic safety and licensing board. Citing a number of deficiencies at Seabrook, the board said the company's idea was not ''sufficient to inspire confidence that their motion deserves further consideration at this time.'' Decision Can Be Appealed Public Service of New Hampshire can appeal today's decision to a separate N.R.C. appeals panel and ultimately to the five-man commission. But the issue of special provisions to allow the full-power operation of reactors when state and local officials refuse to take part in emergency planning is apt to be decided by the commission long before any appeal on the Seabrook issue can be completed. Among the deficiencies, the board said that the ''as-built strength'' of the Seabrook reactor's containment building ''may be less than designed.'' The company had argued that the containment structure would prevent any significant release of harmful radioactivity in a reactor accident. Since the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979, the N.R.C. has required the preparation of a plan and a drill to evacuate all persons in a 10-mile radius of commercial reactors before full-power operations can begin. 'Path of Arrogance' Seen When the New Hampshire company filed its request for the one-mile waiver, Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachussetts Democrat, called it ''ludicrous.'' He said it showed that the utility had chosen the ''path of arrogance.'' In February, the commission voted to publish for comment a proposed rule change that would allow the full-power operation of reactors without complete state and local commitments to evacuation plans. Under a so-called ''realism rule,'' the amended standard would assume that state and local police, fire and hospital agencies would respond in a real emergency. The proposed change would allow the full-power licensing both of the Seabrook plant and the Shoreham reactor of the Long Island Lighting Company.",1987-04-23T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

Will Keep Two Experts at Embattled Nuclear Plant,"Image U.N. inspectors at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant on Thursday. Some will remain through the weekend and two will be stationed there. Credit... Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times As fighting raged in Ukraine this week near Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog agency managed to inspect the site and, perhaps more important, station two inspectors there to monitor its safety. Putting independent nuclear experts at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to give unbiased reports on conditions there was a victory for the International Atomic Energy Agency and its director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi. For weeks, Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling at the plant that Mr. Grossi said on Friday has raised the possibility of a nuclear catastrophe, though there were no new reports of shelling around the plant as of Saturday afternoon. The danger has only grown as Ukraine has stepped up a counteroffensive in the region. “Now, when there is an allegation that something has happened at the plant, you can turn to us,” he said, rather than weighing the conflicting claims of Russia and Ukraine. “That’s the difference.” The drama over the I.A.E.A.’s visit to the plant has dominated the news out of Ukraine for days. On Thursday, Mr. Grossi and 13 experts made it through the front lines after weeks of negotiation and inspected the site for about four hours. Six members of the team stayed behind to continue working through the weekend. Mr. Grossi said that two of them would stay indefinitely. Mr. Grossi said he expected to produce a report “early next week, as soon as we have the full picture of the situation by the end of the weekend, more or less.” He said he would brief the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday. Though the U.N. team had success in its initial mission to inspect the plant, the agency has little power to do more than sound alarms. It cannot impose a cease-fire or establish a demilitarized zone near the plant, which many experts see as the only way to ease the danger. On Saturday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey offered in a phone call with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to help mediate on the plant, according to a statement from his office. The plant has been repeatedly bombarded over the last month, and at a news conference in Vienna on Friday, Mr. Grossi said that physical damage from ordnance was the biggest threat. “The physical integrity of the facility has been violated not once, but several, several times,” he said. More than once reactors have been shut down or disconnected from the grid because critical power lines that are needed to keep reactor cores cool were damaged. Just hours before the U.N. team arrived on Thursday, shelling forced one of the reactors to shut down and switch to diesel generators.

ccd0e5e5-5bfa-4805-9320-d96c97d3c302,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/09/world/asia/japans-prime-minister-seeks-public-support-for-nuclear-energy.html,Japan’s Premier Seeks Support for Using Nuclear Power,"TOKYO — In a rare personal appeal on national television, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda asked for his nation’s support on Friday in restarting the first of Japan’s idled nuclear plants, saying that keeping the plants offline could cause blackouts and economic chaos at a time when the country’s struggling economy can least afford it. That Mr. Noda took his case to the public on such an crucial issue, rather than setting policy behind closed doors, is a testament to the deep public distrust gripping the nation since last year’s nuclear disaster and the government’s playing down of the risks it posed. Despite increasingly dire warnings about the economic effects of a sudden turn from nuclear energy, a majority of Japanese remain unconvinced that it is safe to turn the plants back on. In the 10-minute speech, Mr. Noda spoke in stark terms, saying he had concluded that Japan could not maintain its current living standards without nuclear power, at least in the short term. Responding to the commonly heard argument that Japan is getting along fine without the plants, he said that conservation measures would not be enough in the steamy summer months to overcome the loss of the nation’s nuclear plants, which before last year’s accident supplied almost a third of Japan’s electricity. He also cited national security, saying Japan needed nuclear power to avoid relying too heavily on oil and natural gas from the politically volatile Middle East. “Cheap and reliable electricity are essential for supporting prosperous and decent livelihoods,” Mr. Noda said. “Japanese society cannot function if we stop or try to do without nuclear power generation.” The need to import more oil and gas to make up for the shortfall has been cited as a major factor behind Japan posting its first yearly trade deficit in more than three decades. Mr. Noda promised better oversight, saying he hoped to restart the first plant in the western town of Ohi quickly, but that he would not restart others until their safety measures had been thoroughly reviewed. His administration has already deemed the Ohi plant safe and considers it a test case for whether the public will tolerate at least some of the 50 idled commercial reactors being brought back into operation. The restart issue has polarized Japan for months now, as the country’s still-functioning reactors went offline, one by one, for regular maintenance. In the uproar that followed the triple meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, the government had said it would not restart the reactors without local approval, but officials did not anticipate the depth of public skepticism about the government’s ability to oversee the politically powerful nuclear industry. That skepticism was given a powerful voice in recent months, as the upstart mayor of Japan’s third-largest city, Osaka, became the country’s most popular politician seemingly overnight by demanding more transparency on the nuclear issue and more caution in restarting plants. Still, many Japanese share Mr. Noda’s worry that power shortages could cost jobs and accelerate the nation’s industrial decline, driving more businesses abroad. For weeks, his government has been trying to persuade local leaders to allow a restart of the Ohi plant, which provides power to the heavily urbanized Kansai region, including the cities of Osaka and Kyoto. He has said he wants to restart that plant first because Kansai faces the most severe potential electricity shortages in Japan during the summer, when air-conditioner use surges. The area is also the home to Japan’s struggling electronics industry. The threat of rolling blackouts seems to have persuaded most local leaders to accept at least a temporary restart of the Ohi plant. The Fukui prefectural government, which has been very supportive of nuclear power in the past, is expected to make a decision as early as next week to approve the restart. However, the mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto, who recently agreed to allowing the plant to operate for the summer, has said he may ask that it be turned off again in September, saying he is against a permanent restart until Japan revamps its nuclear oversight. “Restarting the Ohi plant will solve the problem for now, but it still leaves open the question of what happens in September,” said Hiroshi Tasaka, a nuclear policy expert at Tama University in Tokyo who advised the previous prime minister, Naoto Kan. “There may be a political showdown if Prime Minister Noda tries to keep the plant on, or restarts other plants, without strengthening regulatory oversight.” After his speech, about 1,000 people demonstrated outside the prime minister’s office in central Tokyo, chanting “We oppose restarts” and “Protect our children.” In recent polls, including one conducted earlier this week, about two-thirds of Japanese said they opposed immediate restarting of the nation’s plants. In his speech, Mr. Noda sought to address some of those concerns by explaining measures his government was taking to avoid a repeat of last year’s accident, which was caused when a huge earthquake and tsunami knocked out cooling systems at Fukushima Daiichi. The main step, he said, was overhauling Japan’s current regulatory oversight, which he admitted had failed to prevent the Fukushima accident. A series of recent investigations into the causes of the accident have painted a picture of plant operators who hid safety violations, and compliant regulators who sought to save the operators money by ignoring warnings that the plant was vulnerable to tsunamis. Mr. Noda said his government was moving as quickly as possible to create an independent nuclear regulatory agency. He was responding to criticism that the current watchdog, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, suffers from conflict of interest issues because it is part of the Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry, which is charged with promoting the nuclear industry. He also said the prime minister’s office would move quickly to take direct control in the case of a future accident, such as by dispatching a top official to the site of the accident. Critics of the government’s handling of the Fukushima accident have said the prime minister at the time, Mr. Kan, was out of touch and too inconsistent during the crucial first days of the accident.",2012-06-08T17:12:38.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Opponents of the plant have for years called for an independent safety assessment, but the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has said that the reactors get one of those every time one of its inspectors walks through the door and that its regular process assures safety. Now, though, with the plant up for relicensing, the owner, Entergy Nuclear, would like to reassure the public and has decided to pay for an assessment itself. In an announcement on Wednesday, Michael R. Kansler, president and chief nuclear officer of Entergy Nuclear, said the plant’s “special circumstances” merited a safety evaluation by outsiders, to be given full access to the plant and its personnel. He said he hoped the assessment would be completed sometime around midyear. “Repeated and continuous Nuclear Regulatory Commission assessments have concluded that Indian Point is safe,” he said in a conference call with reporters. But, he added, “we hope this evaluation will be another step in building public confidence.” Riverkeeper, a group concerned with water quality in the Hudson that has intervened in the relicensing hearings to try to close the two reactors, professed to have no confidence in this approach. “An independent safety assessment is not an assessment contracted and paid for by the company needing an assessment,” said Lisa Rainwater, the group’s policy director. “There are times when the federal government needs to step in and put taxpayers’ dollars to work for the sake of public health and safety.” The N.R.C. was also rather ho-hum. It said it had no objection to the independent evaluation but had more confidence in its own inspection procedure. It also pointed out that groups like the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, an electric utility organization that organizes reactor operators to conduct inspection visits and audits of other reactors, already provide independent assessments. In fact, one of the co-chairmen of the assessment panel chosen by Entergy is a former chairman and chief executive of the institute, James T. Rhodes. He is also the former president and chief executive of another nuclear utility, Virginia Electric and Power Company. The other co-chairman is Neil E. Todreas, a professor emeritus of nuclear engineering at M.I.T. and, for eight years in the 1980s, the head of the nuclear engineering department there. The members include John S. Dyson, now chairman of Millbank Capital Management and a former chairman of the New York Power Authority, which used to own Indian Point 3. The 12 members also include experts in security and in emergency planning. The group is supposed to meet for the first time this week and spend a total of three weeks at the plant, which is in Buchanan. It will spend time before and after the meeting preparing for its visits, Mr. Todreas said. Mr. Rhodes said that the group was “looking at Indian Point as it is now; the relicensing procedure is a separate procedure.” But, he added, “The results of our work might be used in that.” In fact, the results are almost certain to be used by one side or the other. The panel is legally obligated to point out to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission any problems it discovers, Mr. Rhodes said. The N.R.C. said it expected to be notified. The assessment panel will not examine public safety questions beyond Entergy’s control, like the role of the National Guard. Twelve years ago, the N.R.C. itself organized an independent assessment of a reactor, Maine Yankee, near Bath, Me. The report found a variety of problems, including that an emergency cooling system and one that was in regular use were not designed properly and could not be counted on if the plant ran above 90 percent of its rated power output. Eventually so many problems were discovered that the owners decided the plant was not worth fixing and tore it down. But the N.R.C. insists that since then, its regular inspection system has improved, eliminating the need for a repeat of that kind of audit at Indian Point.",2008-03-23T06:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,regionals-new-york-n.y.-

Tuesday, the start of low-power testing after years of dispute. Operators at the Seabrook nuclear power plant started an atomic chain reaction in the plant's 100 tons of uranium fuel at 5:23 P.M. Tuesday, the start of low-power testing after years of dispute. Operators plan to conduct tests for about seven days at power levels ranging from a fraction of 1 percent to 3 percent of full power. In Seabrook's control room, there was no apparent sign that nuclear operations had begun, but about 30 plant workers broke into applause and shook hands when told the reactor had split its first atoms. Originally planned for commercial operation 10 years ago at a cost of $973 million, the plant suffered repeated regulatory delays and cost overruns that drove its price to $6 billion. The plant also became a focus of protests by nuclear power opponents. Protests have resulted in more than 3,200 arrests since construction began in 1976, including 734 arrests in two days of civil disobedience earlier this month. License Won Last Month Despite its woes, the seaside plant was completed in July 1986 and last month won its low-power testing license, which allows it to conduct tests at up to 5 percent of full power. Still unresolved is whether Seabrook will ever operate commercially. It needs Federal approval for evacuation plans for crowded beaches and communities up to 10 miles away, including six communities in Massachusetts, which refuses to cooperate. Seabrook has developed its own evacuation plans for Massachusetts, and hearings on them by the Nuclear Regualtory Commission licensing board are expected to finish later this month. Seabrook officials hope to win a commercial license this fall. Plant opponents, led by Attorney General James Shannon of Massachusetts, have promised to fight to the United States Supreme Court if necessary to block a commercial license. But Edward Brown, president of Seabrook's operator, New Hampshire Yankee, expresses confidence that the plant will run commercially. 'Plant Is Going to Operate' ''The opposition also said they were going to take us to court on the low-power license - they didn't win,'' Mr. Brown said. ''It's inevitable this plant is going to operate.'' He said ''we'd be much better off'' if the state of Massachusetts participated in emergency planning. Seabrook's owners may also have to prove they are financially qualified to run the plant commercially. The lead owner, the Public Service Company of New Hampshire is under Federal bankruptcy protection from its creditors, and some of the other 11 New England utilities with stakes in the plant also face financial problems.",1989-06-15T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

Roberts resign from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission appealed to President Reagan today to ''swiftly remove'' the commissioner for malfeasance. One of half a dozen Congressional critics who demanded that Thomas M. Roberts resign from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission appealed to President Reagan today to ''swiftly remove'' the commissioner for malfeasance. In a letter, Representative Sam Gejdenson, a Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the Nuclear Oversight Subcommittee of the House Interior Committee, asked Mr, Reagan to dismiss Mr. Roberts, a political protege of Vice President Bush, for ''betraying the trust'' shown him when he was appointed in 1981. Since mid-April, Mr. Roberts, 50 years old, a former manufacturer of components for the nuclear power industry, has rejected demands for his resignation from two Senators and five members of the House, all Democrats. On April 9 Mr. Roberts testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee about his role in informing a nuclear power utility about a Government memorandum on deficiiencies in the utility's reactor. The committee chairman, Senator John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, called his testimony ''evasive'' and ''false.'' No Comment at White House In May, before the Senate Subcommittee on Nuclear Regulation of the Committee in Environment and Public Works, Mr. Roberts first declined to answer questions, but after a month gave responses that the subcommittee chairman, Senator John M. Breaux of Louisiana, called ''evasive.'' The chairman further said his responses had made him join in the demands that the commissioner step down. Mr. Roberts's second five-year term on the five-member commission expires in 1990. The White House press office said there would be no immediate comment on the Gejdenson letter. Bob Newlin, a press spokesman at the regulatory agency, said Mr. Roberts was preparing a letter of response to Mr. Gejdenson. At a news conference, Mr. Gejdenson said the White House was ''doing the nuclear industry no favor by allowing a questionable commissioner to continue in office.'' He warned that Mr. Thomas's continued presence on the commission would bring further investigative hearings on conduct by which he said Mr. Roberts had ''squandered any stature he had to serve on the N.R.C.'' 'People Need Protection' ''This man stands between the American people and the nuclear utilities,'' Mr. Gejdenson told reporters. ''If 20 percent of them are not doing their duty, that is pretty serious. In rural eastern Connecticut, tens of thousands of Americans - and in New York City, millions - live near nuclear power plants. These people need better protection than Mr. Roberts can give them.'' Mr. Roberts has admitted there is a ''current controversy'' over his office's disclosure of an internal commission document to a nuclear power company regulated by the commission. The matter is under ''criminal investigation'' by the Justice Department, Mr. Roberts said. He has argued that ''when measured against six years of an otherwise unblemished record of service, this incident does not warrant resignation.'' Conveying Memo Denied He has said he did not pass on to Middle South Utilities the commission document, a memorandum bearing his ititials that alerted the company to allegations of flaws at its Waterford reactor near New Orleans. He has said he was confident he would be cleared of criminal misconduct. Mr. Gejdenson, in his letter to Mr. Reagan and in statements to reporters today, said that if the Justice Department found insufficient evidence to bring charges it would not alter a ''demonstrated contempt for the proper process of government'' that ''violates the basic standards of office.'' ''His position is that if he is not criminally indictable, that is a reason for him to hold high office,'' Mr. Gejdenson said. ''But if you take a look both at specific instances and at the way he has generally played his role, this is not an individual who ought to be serving on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.''",1987-06-19T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in Kyiv, Ukraine, last week. Credit... Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times The United Nations’ nuclear watchdog agency is expected on Tuesday to issue findings from its visit to the embattled Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, a day after renewed shelling caused a fire that once again led to the plant’s disconnection from Ukraine’s national power grid. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the agency’s director general, is expected to share findings about the facility’s safety and security in the report. Later in the day, the agency plans to brief the U.N. Security Council about the findings. For weeks, active fighting has occurred around the nuclear facility, which is occupied by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian engineers, raising fears of a nuclear catastrophe. On Monday, a fire caused by shelling forced staff members to sever the plant’s last connection to a reserve line that was providing its only source of outside power. That placed critical cooling systems at risk of relying solely on emergency backup power, said Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Galushchenko. Reactor No. 6, the only working reactor at the plant, was still producing power for the facility itself. As of Monday evening, engineers had not switched on diesel generators, according to an official from Energoatom, the Ukrainian company responsible for operating the facility. Mr. Galushchenko said it was yet another precarious moment made more threatening by the fact that firefighting crews had not been able to reach the site of the blaze. “Any repairs to the lines are now impossible,” he said. “Fighting is taking place around the station.” Repeated shelling over the past month has damaged all of the plant’s connections to four high-voltage external power lines, forcing it to use a lower-voltage reserve line to power the cooling equipment needed to prevent meltdowns. It was that reserve line that was cut off on Monday. The I.A.E.A. first visited the plant on Thursday after weeks of negotiations. That day, a convoy of 14 experts, including Mr. Grossi, inspected the site for close to four hours. Six team members stayed through the weekend, and two are set to stay indefinitely. Ukrainian officials pushed the agency to offer a robust assessment of both the conditions at the plant and the challenges facing the Ukrainian engineers charged with its safe operation. At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Grossi said that his biggest concern regarding the physical safety of the facility was related to a reliable connection to external power.",2022-09-06T16:36:48.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world

Referring twice to Dick Cheney as “Darth Vader,” ElBaradei told me in an interview that “U.S. policy consisted of two mantras  Iran should not have the knowledge and should not spin one single centrifuge. They kept saying, wait, Iran is not North Korea, it will buckle. That was absolutely a mistake.” Instead of building on Iran’s Afghan help in 2001, exploring an Iranian “grand bargain” offer in 2003, or backing 2005 European mediation that hinged on the U.S. agreeing to sale of a French nuclear power reactor, “We got Darth Vader and company saying Iran was in the axis of evil and we have to change this regime.” The result, ElBaradei said, was that instead of containing the program at a few dozen centrifuges, “Iran now has close to 5,500 centrifuges, and they have 1,000 kilos of low enriched uranium, and they have the know-how.” Still, he dismissed the notion that Iran “could go to a weapon tomorrow” as “hype,” putting the time frame for that at two to five years. Imagine if Roosevelt in 1942 had said to Stalin, sorry, Joe, we don’t like your Communist ideology so we’re not going to accept your help in crushing the Nazis. I know you’re powerful, but we don’t deal with evil. That’s a rough equivalent on the stupidity scale of what Bush achieved by consigning Iran’s theocracy to the axis of evil and failing to probe how the country might have helped in two wars and the wider Middle East when the conciliatory Mohammad Khatami was president. Seldom in the annals of American diplomacy has moral absolutism trumped realism to such devastating effect. Bush gifted Iran increased power without taking even a peek at how that might serve U.S. objectives. So here we are, several thousand centrifuges on, with Iran getting what it has long craved: recognition of the regime from the Obama administration, relegation of threats and renunciation of the demand that enrichment be suspended as a condition for America’s joining other major powers in nuclear talks with Iran. That’s salutary. American realism is now essential. It should heed ElBaradei’s view: “I don’t believe the Iranians have made a decision to go for a nuclear weapon, but they are absolutely determined to have the technology because they believe it brings you power, prestige and an insurance policy.” I think it’s almost certainly too late to stop Iran achieving virtual nuclear power status  something like Brazil’s or Japan’s mastery of the know-how without a weapon. Iran’s advances of the past eight years cannot be undone. What can be transformed is the context Iran operates in; that in turn will determine how “virtual” Iran remains. One context changer was Obama’s call for a nuclear-free world: it’s hard to argue for nonproliferation without tackling disarmament. “You can’t have nine countries telling the likes of Iran nuclear weapons are dangerous for you, but we need to go on refining our arsenals,” said ElBaradei, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005 and ends his term later this year. “It’s a different world.” He sees two years of U.S.-Iranian talks as needed, given the degree of mistrust, with “every grievance on the table.” Here’s one normalization scenario: Iran ceases military support for Hamas and Hezbollah; adopts a “Malaysian” approach to Israel (nonrecognition and noninterference); agrees to work for stability in Iraq and Afghanistan; accepts intrusive International Atomic Energy Agency verification of a limited nuclear program for peaceful ends only; promises to fight Qaeda terrorism; commits to improving its human rights record. The United States commits itself to the Islamic Republic’s security and endorses its pivotal regional role; accepts Iran’s right to operate a limited enrichment facility with several hundred centrifuges for research purposes; agrees to Iran’s acquiring a new nuclear power reactor from the French; promises to back Iran’s entry into the World Trade Organization; returns seized Iranian assets; lifts all sanctions; and notes past Iranian statements that it will endorse a two-state solution acceptable to the Palestinians. Any such deal is a game changer, transformative as Nixon to China (another repressive state with a poor human rights record). It can be derailed any time by an attack from Israel, which has made clear it won’t accept virtual nuclear power status for Iran, despite its own nonvirtual nuclear warheads. “Israel would be utterly crazy to attack Iran,” ElBaradei said. “I worry about it. If you bomb, you will turn the region into a ball of fire and put Iran on a crash course for nuclear weapons with the support of the whole Muslim world.” To avoid that nightmare Obama will have to get tougher with Israel than any U.S. president in recent years.

The restarting of reactor No. 3 at the Ohi nuclear plant was ordered two weeks ago by Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, in a decision that has spurred growing public protests. The plant’s operator, Kansai Electric Power, had been working since then to prepare the reactor to resume its operations on Sunday. All of Japan’s 50 functional reactors were taken offline one by one for safety checks after the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, which contaminated a large part of northern Japan with radiation. The last reactor was shut down in early May amid widespread public concern over the safety of nuclear plants in the event of another large earthquake and tsunami of the sort that struck Japan in March 2011. Mr. Noda said the restarting of the reactor was necessary to avoid crippling power shortages in the heavily urbanized Kansai region, which the plant serves. However, his decision has drawn unusually vocal public opposition in normally compliant Japan, with many Japanese saying that he ignored safety concerns to protect the powerful nuclear industry. Over the weekend, about 200 protesters blocked the road to the Ohi plant. Kansai Electric said it had enough staff members in the plant to restart the reactor, but a senior vice minister from the ministry in charge of nuclear power had to be ferried to the plant by boat. “I’m watching this with a tense feeling,” the official, Seishu Makino of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, said of the restart, according to Japanese news reports. “The government has taken a necessary step forward despite controversy that has divided the nation.” In Tokyo, news reports said that about 1,000 protesters marched on Sunday in central Tokyo, two days after tens of thousands of chanting antinuclear demonstrators filled streets in front of the prime minister’s residence. Despite the protests, Kansai Electric said it had pulled out the control rods in the reactor core on Sunday evening, allowing nuclear fission to resume. The operator said it hoped to have a sustained nuclear reaction by Monday morning, and the first transmission of electricity on Wednesday.",2012-07-01T23:37:58.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

To deter such an ominous possibility from threatening the world again, Washington wants to strengthen the powers of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is responsible for guarding against the diversion of nuclear material to bomb-making. But the effort has run into determined resistance, not from rogue states bent on acquiring nuclear arsenals, but from two allies -- Germany and Japan -- that fear a new burden on their flourishing nuclear power industries. While expressing commitment to nonproliferation, diplomats from each country, in separate interviews today, said the expanded powers that Washington is seeking for the atomic energy agency would place unfair economic and financial burdens on the owners of nuclear power plants. Next week, the atomic energy agency's 35-member board of governors will meet in Vienna, where a majority of the nations will seek to persuade the Germans and Japanese to change their positions. The board operates by consensus, and the determined opposition of any member could scuttle the changes. In broad terms, the new powers would require nuclear installations to provide more detailed reports about domestic nuclear activity and about the imports and exports of material that can be used to make nuclear weapons. Agency inspectors would also acquire more sweeping search authority. ""I'm in favor of it,"" said Gary Milhollin, director of the nonprofit Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, about the agency's proposed new powers. But, he added, ""there are some simple things the agency could do now on its own, to increase their credibility and effectiveness."" Foremost, he said, the agency should make public much of what it now keeps confidential, such as the amount of nuclear material a country has. Currently, the agency inspectors have authority to inspect only the nuclear plants that a government has declared exist. The agency strives to safeguard against the enrichment of uranium or production of plutonium, which can be used in nuclear warheads. In Iraq, which is a member of the atomic energy agency, the inspectors had access to President Hussein's declared installations. But within the same compound, Iraq was developing nuclear weapons, in ""undeclared"" installations, which were off limits to the inspectors. More recently, in North Korea, the Government had no problems with allowing the atomic energy agency to inspect declared sites. But when inspectors sought to look at sites the Government had not declared, but which American intelligence said were nuclear installations, the North Koreans balked, effectively confirming that they were developing their own nuclear weapons. In principle, the German Government agrees that steps must be taken to stop these nations from getting nuclear weapons, said a senior German diplomat here. But he said the expanded powers as now being sought for the agency would give inspectors from the international agency more legal rights to search private property than a German police officer has. Concern about the economic and financial burden on operators of the nuclear installations is also at the foundation of Japanese objections to expanding the atomic energy agency's power, said Makoto Yamanaka, a senior diplomat at the Japanese mission to the United Nations organizations in Vienna. Mr. Yamanaka said the burden of atomic energy inspections is already greater on Japan than on other countries, because of its large nuclear industry. The American representative to the United Nations here, John B. Ritch 3d, agreed that Germany and Japan will bear a greater burden than other countries, including the United States. But, he added, ""the enormous benefits to global security from deterring, or at least detecting, a future Saddam Hussein, overwhelm the modest burdens involved.""",1996-06-04T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,washington

At the Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Plant here, where cows graze in the shadow of the twin cooling towers, contingency plans are being made to turn off the plant, move the fuel into storage, lay off hundreds of workers and buy power from alternative sources. The plans are necessary because of a June 6 referendum in Sacramento and Placer Counties in which 533,000 customers of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District will be asked for the second year in a row what they want to do with the plant, which has been an albatross to the community and the nuclear power industry since it opened 15 years ago. Despite Rancho Seco's singular history of accidents, shutdowns and management turmoil, the vote here is regarded as a bellwether. On both sides of the issue it is being treated as a vote of confidence or no-confidence in an industry that has suffered repeated setbacks in recent years, including the deal, reached this spring after years of relentless local opposition, to close the Shoreham plant on Long Island. If the customers here choose to close Rancho Seco, 35 miles southeast of Sacramento, it would be the first operating nuclear power plant voted out of business. In more than a dozen similar referendums elsewhere in the nation, voters chose to keep plants operating. Spokesmen for the nuclear power industry stress that Rancho Seco is a special case, that this is not a referendum likely to have national reprecussions. But the intense campaign they are waging to keep the plant open and the donations that have rolled in to help them suggest otherwise. The industry has donated $600,000 to the campaign to save Rancho Seco, with a million dollars expected by election day. By comparison, the organizations seeking to close the plant have raised $125,000, campaign financing reports say. ''We don't want to see a single plant go down,'' said Scott Peters, a spokesman for the United States Council for Energy Awareness, which represents the industry. The referendum has its roots in two competing initiatives dealing with Rancho Seco that were on the ballot in the Presidential primary election last June. The one that passed, with 51.7 percent of the vote, kept the plant open for a year's trial period, to be followed by this special election. The other proposal, which would have shut the 913-megawatt plant immediately, failed with 49.4 percent of the vote. Now, a majority of negative votes will close the plant. Voter turnout is expected to be low. 'A Very American Thing' ''They said, 'Give us a chance,' which is a very American thing,'' said Assemblyman Tom Hayden, a Santa Monica Democrat whose Campaign California organization is working to close Rancho Seco. Similar ballot measures in other states, including Maine, Oregon and Massachusetts, have cast the issue as safety versus economics. Here, both the pro-Rancho Seco forces and those seeking to close the plant are arguing that their solution will yield lower electricity rates. Since 1985, when a serious accident shut the reactor for 27 months, rates for the utility's customers have gone up 80 percent. The company now asserts that its technical and management problems are solved, that it has been taken off the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's list of troubled plants and that it is ready to achieve a power output of 63 percent of its annual potential. That level would put the plant in line with the industry's average of 60 percent and would make Rancho Seco cost effective. Opponents say it is folly to assume that a plant that has produced only 38 percent of its power capacity in its first 15 years of existance will improve as it ages. In their pitch to voters, door-to-door canvassers describe Rancho Seco as a ''lemon'' and ask voters how they feel about their latest electricity bill. The significance of the referendum, some say, is this very change in the terms of the debate, from the safety questions of the past to economic ones. ''If nuclear power is to play an important role,'' said Dan Berkovitz, an associate counsel with the Senate Subcommittee on Nuclear Regulation, ''it has to do it economically as well as safely.'' Costly to Close For some voters, the most persuasive argument of Rancho Seco supporters is the cost and uncertainty of turning off a nuclear plant so far ahead of the planned end of its life in 2008. The actual shutdown costs are projected at $200 million. Moreover, since no Federal repository for spent fuel will be available until 2003, the nuclear material will have to be stored at the plant, and guarding and maintaining it is expected to cost $10 million to $15 million a year. Customers would continue to pay for the plant's debt: $40 million a year in bond payments, company officials say. The customers would also subsidize the cost of buyouts for employees who lose their jobs, plus incentive pay for others who are retained to monitor the idle plant. Then there would be the cost of replacement power, much of it purchased from Pacific Gas & Electric, the nation's largest utility. ''For a while it would cost us more to shut down than to run,'' said Dan Whitney, the utility's manager of power planning.",1989-05-28T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

The two reactors at San Onofre had not run since a small amount of radioactive steam escaped from new tubes damaged by vibration and friction. Coming months after the Fukushima Daiichi meltdown in Japan, the event prompted a wave of public opposition and set off a legal and regulatory battle that included Southern California Edison, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which manufactured the parts that leaked. Those parts, called steam generators, cost more than $600 million. In the end, uncertainty over the plant’s fate “was not good for our customers, our investors, or the need to plan for our region’s long-term electricity needs,” said Theodore F. Craver Jr., chief executive of the utility’s parent company, Edison International. The decision delighted nuclear opponents. “I approach today with a good deal of joy,” said S. David Freeman, who shut down construction on several reactors when he ran the Tennessee Valley Authority, and who ran the Sacramento Municipal Utility District after it retired the Rancho Seco nuclear plant two decades ago. “I think this is a step in the right direction, another move toward the renewable revolution that is under way in the state of California,” Mr. Freeman said, adding that closing the reactors opens up the market to use the renewable power that will follow. For now, though, the replacement power source is natural gas. The nuclear industry has had a difficult year as it tries to compete with cheaper, abundant natural gas. San Onofre’s two reactors are the third and fourth reactors to be retired so far this year in the United States. “It’s no secret that power markets have been radically changed by the development of shale gas,” said John Reed, an investment banker who specializes in nuclear reactors. “That changes the economics of any other power supply option, including nuclear.” Dominion shut its reactor in Wisconsin in May because of unfavorable economics, and Duke said in February that it would not restart Crystal River 3 because mechanical problems were too expensive to fix. The loss of San Onofre has already pushed up electricity prices in Southern California, to about $4.15 a megawatt-hour higher than prices in Northern California. Those higher prices are an inducement to developers to build new generation, either natural gas or renewable energy, according to Marie Rinkoski Spangler, an electricity analyst at the Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration. Ms. Rinkoski Spangler said that since June 2012, California has added slightly more generating capacity than it will lose with the retirement of the reactors, in the wrong places. “Geography really matters,” she said. “The generation itself is not enough, because of where San Onofre sat” near Los Angeles and San Diego. At the California Independent System Operator, the company that runs the power grid in most of the state, Steve Berberich, the chief executive, said that most of the replacement power had come from natural gas, and that if California’s goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions per kilowatt-hour, “you’re moving in the wrong direction.” But in the longer term, he said, retiring San Onofre would encourage the replacement of older power plants with newer ones that would produce more electricity with the same amount of fuel. And the newer ones could increase and decrease their output faster, he said, making them useful to balance a system with a lot of wind and solar generation, which is highly variable. San Onofre 2 and 3 entered commercial operation in August 1983 and April 1984. A third reactor was mothballed in 1992. Many nuclear plants around the country have won permission from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to run 20 years beyond their initial 40-year licenses, but in a conference call with reporters, Mr. Craver of Edison International said that the prospects for license renewal were uncertain, following the three meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in March 2011, and the demand by regulators for a re-evaluation of San Onofre’s vulnerability to earthquake. Edison had been seeking to restart one of the units at 70 percent power, a level it thought the steam generators could tolerate, but when plant opponents persuaded a panel of three administrative law judges at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that this would require a public hearing, the company concluded that the proceedings could stretch to the end of next year or longer. Operation and maintenance expense at the plants, which employ 1,500 people are roughly equal whether it is running or not, he said, and if the plant could not reopen by December, retiring it would be cheaper. The company has $2.7 billion saved up for decommissioning, which is about 90 percent of what is required, he said. Edison shares ownership with San Diego Gas & Electric, which owns 20 percent, and the city of Riverside, which owns 1.79 percent. Edison has about $2.1 billion invested in the plant, the fuel and related assets. Division of costs between Edison’s shareholders and ratepayers, its insurers and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which supplied the heat exchangers, has not been determined. As for the plant’s workers, the closure will be felt in the area. “When 1,100 people lose their jobs, there will certainly be an impact,” said Bob Baker, the mayor of the nearby city of San Clemente. “San Onofre changed San Clemente when it opened, and it’s going to change San Clemente now that it’s closing.”",2013-06-08T04:00:51.000+02:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day

The company, called Tepco, made the admission — over a year and a half after catastrophic meltdowns at Fukushima Daiichi — as part of a report in which it showcased internal changes as the government considers when to allow other reactors to resume operation, including those at Tepco’s two undamaged nuclear plants. But the admission, an apparent bid to inspire confidence, also seemed to confirm one of the main arguments of the company’s critics: that it refused to recognize and fix problems because it did not want to jeopardize the so-called safety myth that Japan’s nuclear technology was infallible. The disaster followed an earthquake and huge tsunami on March 11, 2011, that knocked out crucial cooling systems, allowing three of the plant’s six reactors to melt down. In the report, Tepco said that before the accident it had been afraid to consider the risk of such a large tsunami, fearing admissions of risk could result in public pressure to shut plants down. “There were concerns that if new countermeasures against severe accidents were installed, concern would spread in host communities that the current plants had safety problems,” the report said. The report also repeated Tepco’s position that it did not know such a large tsunami was possible on the coast of Fukushima, which faces the Pacific Ocean. Tepco’s executives have argued that because the tsunami was larger than what some experts had predicted to be possible, the accident should be considered an act of nature for which the company should bear no legal responsibility. The company has already admitted, however, that even its own engineers had predicted a far larger tsunami was possible in Fukushima, a finding that the company and regulators both chose to ignore or not make public. The report on Friday was issued to coincide with the first meeting of a panel of outside experts, including a former United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission chairman, who will oversee improvements at the company’s nuclear division. The company listed several new measures to prevent severe accidents, like creating more backup systems, better crisis management and a corporate culture more willing to acknowledge problems. All but two of the country’s 50 undamaged nuclear reactors remain idled as the government works to convince the public that they are safe. The government has recently given conflicting signals about when those reactors might be turned on, or even who could make that decision. A newly created nuclear watchdog at first seemed to say that no more plants could be turned on until it drew up new safety guidelines, a process that might take until next year, but then seemed to back off by saying that it did not have the authority to do anything more than issue guidelines. Last week, the trade minister, Yukio Edano, said the new agency’s guidelines would be used to determine which reactors could be turned back on, without saying how long it would take to create those new rules. While the disaster, which spewed large amounts of radioactive material across northern Japan, helped strengthen the anti-nuclear movement in the country, many people see a resumption of nuclear power as crucial to avoiding further damage to Japan’s badly shaken economy. With its report, Tepco appeared to be arguing that it had learned its lesson from the accident, and listed new anti-tsunami walls, backup power generators and other new safety steps it has taken at its other plants. Besides the Fukushima Daiichi plant, Tepco also operates the Fukushima Daini plant, also in Fukushima, as well as the world’s largest nuclear plant, Kashiwazaki-Kariwa in Niigata. While saying the tsunami was unforeseeable, the report did say that Tepco could have taken steps that might have prevented the Fukushima accident, like adding backup generators to keep cooling systems operating. It also said it failed to learn from foreign countries, like the United States, which strengthened its nuclear plants against terrorist attacks and accidents after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.",2012-10-12T23:42:53.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific
9c20151b-5aa6-45c8-a6bd-1f390d2257d8,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/05/world/technology-s-false-steps-the-atomic-difference.html,TECHNOLOGY'S FALSE STEPS: THE ATOMIC DIFFERENCE,"Technology in 1986 seems to have suffered a devastating one-two punch. The first blow was to rocketry as a space shuttle blew up, followed by reverberating explosions of an Air Force Titan rocket and a Delta carrying a weather satellite; the second blow was to nuclear power, as a reactor failed catastrophically in the Ukraine. Yet, according to experts in technology, the different public responses to each disaster show something about contrasting attitudes that are emerging toward the machines that move and shape society in the late 20th century. In the case of the shuttle, after the initial shock wore off the public reaction toward the future of space exploration remained generally positive. There were flaws in the rockets, but they could be identified and they could be fixed. Management of the program could be, probably should be, improved, yes. But there seemed to be no real desire to turn back, no sweeping Luddite reaction to all technology. The Price of Technology Indeed, the reaction to the shuttle explosion has been much the same as those that came after most accidents in the past that have punctuated the world's technical and industrial development. When dams broke, trains were wrecked, planes crashed, or even when a gas leak at an insecticide plant in Bhopal, India, left more than 2,000 people dead, people have reflected on the price of technology's many benefits. People have demanded that more attention be paid to making things safer, to fixing the design or manufacture or maintenance of what went wrong. But they have not demanded any basic changes, preferring instead to continue as before, living by turns happily and uneasily with the technologies they feel they cannot live without. Though manifestly imperfect, the technologies have been accepted because their benefits seem to have outweighed the risks. But when the nuclear power reactor at Chernobyl in the Ukraine failed a week ago, catching fire and spreading radiation far and wide, the public response worldwide seems to have been significantly different. The level of intensity and emotion suggests that this is one technology that provokes more doubt and fear than acceptability. Though the passage of only one week's time is hardly enough to tell what the world's assessment will ultimately be, and though the public perception at the moment may or may not be valid, the risks in this case are seen to outweigh the benefits. And those thinkers who have studied the matter offer several key reasons. 'Something About Radiation' ''There is something about radiation and nuclear technology that is in a category by itself,'' said Samuel Florman, an engineer from Scarsdale, N.Y., and author of ''The Existential Pleasures of Engineering.'' ' ''We have plane crashes and chemical spills, and people tend to say, 'That's life,' and go on,'' Mr. Florman said. ''But when there is a nuclear accident, the threat seems different and more insidious. We hear concerns about milk and babies and pregnant women. There's a feeling that whole nations are at hazard.'' Adding to the fears aroused by the Chernobyl accident, several American engineers said, was the Soviet Union's reluctance or failure to divulge many facts of the situation. Lack of knowledge most often leads people to fear the worst, and in nuclear technology such perceived fears are dire indeed. The source of much anxiety is no doubt in the genesis of the technology, nuclear proponents say. People carry in their minds images of the mushroom cloud of Hiroshima, and so atomic bombs and nuclear power plants become to them interchangeable in their potential for death and destruction. Other psychological factors also apparently affect public thinking about nuclear power. The Lack of Control Melvin Kranzberg, professor of the history of technology at the Georgia Institute of Technology, noted that thousands of Americans were killed each year in automobile accidents and that no one has yet died from operations of commercial nuclear power plants in the United States. But this seems not to enter in the unconscious calculus by which people assess nuclear risks. ''People feel they have control over their cars but not over nuclear plants,'' Dr. Kranzberg said. ''This feeling of having no control, not being in the driver's seat, adds to the perception of the nuclear risks.'' Nuclear technology provokes a generalized dread, experts also point out, because the effects of a major accident would not likely be confined to the immediate area, as in the case of most industrial disasters. People who fly in planes or spaceships accept the risks. People do not have to live next door to a chemical plant. But the insidious nature of radiation seems to add a new dimension to the anxieties associated with nuclear technology. Radiation, silent and invisible, can spread far from the accident site and invade the body without anyone's knowing it. It can cause immediate agonizing death or remain in the body as a ''time bomb'' leading to disability or death years away, decades away, or even in generations unborn. The effect from the Ukrainian accident is still unknown. The one to two millirems per hour of exposure of radioactivity reported over Sweden after the accident, for example, presented no health hazard. Within at least two miles of the Chernobyl site, however, experts say they now believe the dosage was probably severe enough to be lethal. 'All the More Menacing' Norman C. Rasmussen, professor of nuclear engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: ''People hate to contemplate dying in strange ways. This makes a thing like radiation seem all the more menacing.'' The very process of assessing nuclear risks, Dr. Rasmussen said, has probably contributed to what he called a public misunderstanding of the actual potential of the hazards. In order to incorporate the necessary safety features in a nuclear plant, for example, engineers must consider anything and everything that could possibly go wrong, assessing probabilities. When some of the engineers' worst-case scenarios become known to the public, they become the basis for opposition to a project and a general, if perhaps mistaken impression of imminent danger. Dr. Rasmussen, a specialist in nuclear risk-benefit analysis, said he hoped Soviet officials would make a full disclosure of the causes of the Chernobyl failure, the amount of radioactive material released and the behavior of the material as it spread from the plant. Such information, he said, would be helpful in revising safety features and in understanding the nature of radiation. Although opposition to nuclear power seemed to diminish in recent years, Alvin Weinberg, former director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, said he expected ''the antinuclear movement to start up all over again'' as a consequence of the Chernobyl disaster. Making a Distinction But many American engineers and scholars say they think most people will continue to make a distinction between nuclear technology and technology in general. People, they note, have largely abandoned the aversion to technology that was widespread in the 1960's and early 70's and tend to have positive feelings toward technology. Henry Petroski, a professor at Duke University and author of ''To Engineer Is Human,'' a collection of essays about learning from mistakes, said the public reaction to the shuttle accident showed an accepting spirit regarding the vulnerabilities of living in a modern technological society. ''Americans seem to be more optimistic these days about technology,'' he said, except when it comes to matters of nuclear power.",1986-05-05T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world

The nation's commercial nuclear power plants reported 2,810 accidents in 1987, about the same number as for a slightly smaller number of plants the previous year, a group critical of the industry said today. The corresponding figure for 1986 was 2,836. At the end of last year, there were 105 nuclear plants in commercial operation as against 99 at the same point a year earlier. The report was issued by the Critical Mass Energy Project of Public Citizen, a group founded with the help of Ralph Nader. The project publishes a compilation of Nuclear Regulatory Commission reports annually, this year on the ninth anniversary of the accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.

But while some are still paying the price for past nuclear decisions, Wall Street analysts say that much of the industry has settled down to business as usual. The usual business, the analysts say, is generating acceptable operating profits and reasonable returns for shareholders in a relatively safe investment environment. In ordinary times, Wall Street views utility stocks as safe havens when interest rates are low and the economy is stagnant. ''One by one these companies are dropping off the list of those who have to face the bullet'' of getting new nuclear plants into their rate structure, said William Haugan of E. F. Hutton & Company, who said he continues to recommend a variety of the industry's stocks. But when the regulatory bullet hits its mark, the damage is often more than a flesh wound, as Middle South Utilities found out earlier this month when the Louisiana Public Service Commission denied in total a rate request made by one of its subsidiaries. The $324 million annual rate increase was requested by the Louisiana Power and Light Company, a Middle South unit, to cover its share of the costs of the Grand Gulf 1 and Waterford 3 nuclear plants. The decision, which has already resulted in a number of offshoot legal and regulatory spats, is leading to a major dispute in the industry over whether localities have the right to overrule rate decisions made by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The F.E.R.C. tentatively set the rates to be paid to the nuclear plant for electricity but the increases still had to go through the local regulatory process. The F.E.R.C., the courts have upheld in previous decisions, has the authority to set rates for power that travels interstate. In the Middle South case, the company set up a separate company called Middle South Energy to sell power generated at the nuclear plants to the utilities. The power from the nuclear plants therefore qualifies to be priced by F.E.R.C. Both Middle South and F.E.R.C. have argued that rates should be set by the Federal agency and the state regulators should abide by those decisions. The Middle South case has been capturing a lot of Wall Street's attention over the past month, mainly because investors have seen their holdings in the company depreciate by about 25 percent to yesterday's closing price of 10 5/8. But analysts contend that the Middle South case is unique, and that most other utilities are on surer footing. ''What's happening to Middle South is a special situation,'' said Daniele Seitz, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, because some of the power crosses into three states - Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi. While Mrs. Seitz said investment decisions in the industry must be made on a individual basis, she believes the business as a whole is ''going in the right direction.'' Analysts say that because of the improving economy this year, electricity use has improved, helping the companies that provide power improve their profit levels. Along with the beneficial turn in the economy has come generally lower interest rates, an environment in which electric utilities often thrive because of their heavy borrowings. In fact, the worst recent disaster on Wall Street for the utility stocks came not because of confrontations with frugal regulators, but because in mid-July the perception on interest rates changed. The belief that interest rates might move upward sent utilities stocks down about 7.5 percent in recent months, and analysts say it would be no surprise if the correction totaled about 10 percent. S. Arlene Barney of the First Boston Corporation told clients recently that ''At this time it is difficult to assess how long the utilities may be expected to underperform the broader market. ''In our opinion the main determinant of this will be the economy. If the economy is not showing some signs of strengthening in the fourth quarter of 1985, we believe that investor attention will refocus on the electric utilities,'' she said. With the July pullback in utility stock prices, First Boston returned a group of these issue to its recommended list. Paine Webber is another investment firm that sees electric utilities as a favorable long-term investment, mainly because of low inflation and steady interest rates. The brokerage house feels that the problem with nuclear plants has shifted into the regulatory arena, and generally is not life threatening for the companies involved. Even so, analysts warn, companies may reduce their common stock dividends because of rate decisions, which would make them less attractive to the conservative investor.",1985-08-16T09:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,financial-desk-business-day

Some countries have tried to limit the number of spent fuel rods that accumulate at nuclear power plants: Germany stores them in costly casks, for example, while China sends them to a desert storage compound in the western province of Gansu. But Japan, like the United States, has kept ever-larger numbers of spent fuel rods in temporary storage pools at the power plants, where they can be guarded with the same security provided for the plants. Figures provided by Tokyo Electric Power on Thursday show that most of the dangerous uranium at the power plant is actually in the spent fuel rods, not the reactor cores themselves. The electric utility said that a total of 11,125 spent fuel rod assemblies were stored at the site. That is about four times as much radioactive material as in the reactor cores combined. Now those temporary pools are proving the power plant’s Achilles’ heel, with the water in the pools either boiling away or leaking out of their containments, and efforts to add more water having gone awry. While spent fuel rods generate significantly less heat than newer ones do, there are strong indications that some fuel rods have begun to melt and release extremely high levels of radiation. Japanese workers struggled on Thursday to add more water to the storage pool at Reactor No. 3. Helicopters dropped water, only to have it scattered by strong breezes. Water cannons mounted on police trucks — equipment designed to disperse rioters — were then deployed to spray water on the pools. It is unclear if that effort worked. Richard T. Lahey Jr., a retired nuclear engineer who oversaw General Electric’s safety research in the early 1970s for the kind of nuclear reactors used in Fukushima, said that the zirconium cladding on the fuel rods could burst into flames if exposed to air for hours when a storage pool lost its water. Zirconium, once ignited, burns extremely hot and is difficult to extinguish, added Mr. Lahey, who helped write a classified report for the United States government several years ago on the vulnerabilities of storage pools at American nuclear reactors. Very high levels of radiation above the storage pools suggest that the water has drained in the 39-foot-deep pools to the point that the 13-foot-high fuel rod assemblies have been exposed to air for hours and are starting to melt, said Robert Albrecht, a longtime nuclear engineer who worked as a consultant to the Japanese nuclear reactor manufacturing industry in the 1980s. Under normal conditions, the rods are kept covered with 26 feet of water that is circulated to prevent it from growing too warm. Gregory Jaczko, the chairman of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission , made the startling assertion on Wednesday that there was little or no water left in another storage pool, the one on top of Reactor No. 4, and expressed grave concern about the radiation that would be released as a result. The 1,479 spent fuel rod assemblies there include 548 that were removed from the reactor only in November and December to prepare the reactor for maintenance, and these may be emitting more heat than the older assemblies in other storage pools. Even without recirculating water, it should take many days for the water in a storage pool to evaporate, nuclear engineers said. So the rapid evaporation and even boiling of water in the storage pools now is a mystery, raising the question of whether the pools may also be leaking. Michael Friedlander, a former senior nuclear power plant operator who worked 13 years at three American reactors, said that storage pools typically had a liner of stainless steel three-eighths of an inch thick, and that they rested on reinforced concrete bases. So even if the liner ruptured, “unless the concrete was torn apart, there’s no place for the water to go,” he said. Mr. Lahey said that much of the water may have sloshed out during the earthquake. Much smaller earthquakes in California have produced heavy water losses from sloshing at storage pools there, partly because the pools are located high in reactor buildings. “It’s like being at the top of a flagpole, and once you start ground motion, you can easily slosh it,” he said. When the water in a storage pool disappears, the fuel rods’ uranium continues to heat the rods’ zirconium cladding. This causes the zirconium to oxidize, or rust, and even catch fire. The spent fuel rods have little radioactive iodine, which has a half-life of eight days and has mostly disappeared through radioactive decay once fission stopped when the rods left the reactor cores. But the spent fuel rods are still loaded with cesium and strontium that can start to escape if the fuel rods burn. One factor that might determine how serious the situation becomes is whether the uranium oxide pellets in the rods stay vertical even if the cladding burns off. This is possible because pellets sometimes become fused together while in the reactor. If the pellets stay standing up, then even with the water and zirconium gone, nuclear fission will not take place, Mr. Albrecht said. But Tokyo Electric said this week that there was a chance of “recriticality” in the storage pools — that is, the uranium in the fuel rods could resume the fission that previously took place inside the reactor, spewing out radioactive byproducts. Mr. Albrecht said this was very unlikely, but could happen if the stacks of pellets slumped over and became jumbled together on the floor of the storage pool. Plant workers would then need to add water with lots of boron because the boron absorbs neutrons and interrupts nuclear chain reactions. If a lot of fission occurs, which may happen only in an extreme case, the uranium would melt through anything underneath it. If it encounters water as it descends, a steam explosion could then scatter the molten uranium. At Daiichi, each assembly has either 64 large fuel rods or 81 slightly smaller fuel rods. A typical fuel rod assembly has roughly 380 pounds of uranium. One big worry for Japanese officials is that Reactor No. 3, the main target of the helicopters and water cannons on Thursday, uses a new and different fuel. It uses mixed oxides, or mox, which contains a mixture of uranium and plutonium, and can produce a more dangerous radioactive plume if scattered by fire or explosions. According to Tokyo Electric, 32 of the 514 fuel rod assemblies in the storage pond at Reactor No. 3 contain mox. Japan had hoped to solve the spent fuel buildup with a large-scale plan to recycle the rods into fuel that would go back into its nuclear program. But even before Friday’s quake, that plan had hit setbacks. Central to Japan’s plans is a $28 billion reprocessing facility in Rokkasho village, north of the quake zone, which would extract uranium and plutonium from the rods for use in making mox fuel. After countless construction delays, test runs began in 2006, and the plant’s operator, Japan Nuclear Fuel, said operations would begin in 2010. But in late 2010, its opening was delayed by two years. To close the nuclear fuel recycling process, Japan also built the Monju, a fast breeder reactor , which started running in full in 1994. But a year later, a fire caused by a sodium leak shut down the plant. Despite revelations that the operator, the quasi-governmental Japan Atomic Energy Agency, had covered up the seriousness of the accident, Monju again started operating at a reduced capacity. Another nuclear reprocessing facility in Tokaimura has been shut down since 1999, when an accident at an experimental fast breeder showered hundreds in the vicinity with radiation, and two workers were killed. Many of these facilities were hit by Friday’s earthquake. A spent fuel pool at Rokkasho spilled over, and power at the plant was lost, triggering backup generators, Japan Nuclear Fuel said. According to the Citizens Nuclear Information Center, an anti-nuclear group, about 3,000 tons of fuel are stored at Rokkasho. But the plant, about 180 feet above sea level, escaped the tsunami. Grid power was restored on Monday, the company said.",2011-03-17T18:45:36.000+01:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

The authority said it had begun talks with the Entergy Corporation, a major energy company based in New Orleans, for the sale of the Indian Point 3 reactor on the Hudson River, 35 miles north of Manhattan, and the James A. FitzPatrick plant on Lake Ontario. The Indian Point 2 reactor, neighboring Indian Point 3, is owned by Consolidated Edison. Power Authority officials would not say how much they expected to reap from a sale, but industry analysts said the figure would almost certainly be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and perhaps more than $1 billion. The authority said that as a condition of any sale, it would continue to provide low-cost power to certain corporate clients under the state's economic development programs, and to local government agencies like New York City, the city's Housing Authority and the subway system. Last year, the two nuclear plants accounted for 32 percent of the electricity produced by the Power Authority, which also runs several hydroelectric plants. As recently as two years ago, there was no market to speak of for power plants, but in New York and many other states, state regulators have forced utilities to sell off their plants to encourage competition in an industry that has been dominated for a century by government-sanctioned monopolies. For the utilities, that has produced a windfall, as plants powered by gas, oil and coal have fetched prices several times the values that the companies have listed for them on their books. Nuclear plants are generally considered less desirable because they can be expensive to operate and, later, to decommission. Only a few companies have actively shopped for nuclear plants, and the handful that have been sold have gone for a small fraction of their book value. But industry analysts say the FitzPatrick and Indian Point plants are better properties than most nuclear plants that have gone on the market so far. ''I think we're going to start to see more attractive plants like these being sold, and more bidders, and at more attractive prices,'' said Stephen Fetter, an energy industry analyst at Fitch Investors Service. The Power Authority, a quasi-independent agency whose board is appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki, did not set out to sell its nuclear plants, according to Mike Petralia, a spokesman. ''But over the past 18 months or so, we've been approached by several companies expressing interest in purchasing the plants,'' he said, while refusing to name any but Entergy. Larry Shapiro, a lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group who follows energy issues, said he was troubled that the authority did not select a buyer through a formal, competitive process. But Mr. Petralia said the authority had made its standards clear to each of its prospective suitors, including an idea of its asking price and its insistence on job security for plant employees and a continuing role in economic development programs. ''Entergy seems to be the only one willing and able to meet those conditions,'' he said. Assemblyman Paul D. Tonko, a Democrat who heads the Energy Committee, applauded the proposed sale, which he has advocated in the past, but he complained that the process had so far been cloaked in secrecy, making it difficult to determine whether the state was getting the best possible deal. Indian Point 3 went into operation in 1976 and has a 980-megawatt capacity, making it one of the largest-output power plants in the country. FitzPatrick began operation in 1975 and has a capacity of 800 megawatts.",1999-11-03T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,new-york-and-region

Oct. 14 – John Edwards won support Sunday for his environment plan when the organization, Friends of the Earth Action, endorsed his candidacy for the Democratic nomination. The organization’s president, Brent Blackwelder, said that the group liked Mr. Edwards’ proposals to fight global warming, and his opposition to nuclear power plants and the influence of lobbyists on policy. He said other Democratic candidates had outstanding records on the environment, but when it came to major issues like nuclear power, Mr. Edwards had the most comprehensive plan. “Edwards is razor sharp and clear: we don’t want to go the route of nuclear power plants,” said Mr. Blackwelder, whereas Senator Barack Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton wanted to explore the nuclear option. “We intend to run an independent campaign to educate the voters,” Mr. Blackwelder said. The canvassing, advertisements and seminars will take place mostly in New Hampshire, where the nuclear issue has resonance because of the nuclear power plant at Seabrook , as well as in other states. “It is a nationwide endorsement,” he said. “In South Carolina there are important issues we want to talk about there, including the Bush plan to dump radioactive waste at the Savannah river site. We think the same message will resonate.” Mr. Blackwelder said that the group took into consideration polls saying Democrats rank global warming as one of the top three issues of concern to them. Mr. Edwards, accepting the endorsement, said: “I am opposed to the building of new nuclear power plants, which is different from the position taken by Senator Clinton and Senator Obama.” “I do believe that Americans will have to sacrifice,” he later said. “And that means we are going to have to be willing to conserve.” His environment initiatives include capping greenhouse gas pollution starting in 2010, and reducing it by 20 percent by 2020 and then 80 percent by 2050. In addition, his proposals include investing in renewable energy sources, and an energy fund that auctions off $10 billion in greenhouse pollution permits and repealing subsidies for big oil companies. Mr. Blackwelder made the announcement at a gathering for Mr. Edwards at a private lakeside home here set among pine trees. The event had the air of a neighborhood picnic. People brought dogs and children and helped themselves to snacks set up on the lawn. About one hundred people settled on folding chairs in a circle around Mr. Edwards as he stood to speak and answer their questions. “I am reminded out here in this beautiful setting on a Sunday in New Hampshire what our moral responsibility is to protect the world, to protect the earth on behalf of our selves, our children and our grandchildren.” Related: Compare what the candidates have said on climate change",2007-10-14T23:46:58.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

And the debate over closing the Indian Point nuclear station in Westchester County brings reminders about what was lost when Shoreham was abandoned. Back in 1965, the Long Island Lighting Company (where I was the senior vice president from 1985 to 1987) announced plans to build a nuclear power plant on Long Island. The plant was under construction from 1973 to 1984 but for various reasons, it never produced a single kilowatt. The ultimate defeat of Shoreham stemmed from exaggerated concerns about emergency planning. The campaign against the plant gained momentum in 1979, following the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Though no member of the public was seriously injured there, politicians were eventually persuaded by opposition to the plant to strike a deal with the lighting company to abandon Shoreham. To this day, Long Islanders are still footing the bill for building and demolishing Shoreham. Yet 28 years after the Three Mile Island incident and with about 50 years of commercial use of nuclear power, there are 103 plants now operating in the United States with stellar safety records, and people in countries like France rely on nuclear power plants for almost all of their electricity. And with the price of oil continuing to rise, many utilities are looking to develop more nuclear power plants. One can't help but wonder whether the decommissioning of Shoreham was the real starting point for serious energy problems on Long Island. Right now Long Islanders, while paying for the cost of Shoreham, are not getting any of the benefits that it would have provided. Instead, because of excessive reliance on expensive foreign oil, they are burdened by arguably the highest electricity rates in the United States. One of the primary justifications for Shoreham was that it would reduce Long Island's dependence on foreign oil. If Shoreham were in operation today it would eliminate the need for more than 4 million barrels a year of imported oil. Also, because nuclear fuel costs are a small fraction of fossil fuel costs, it would substantially reduce Long Island's electricity rates and significantly lower the dreaded fuel surcharge. Moreover, Shoreham would have protected the air we breathe by eliminating the emission of about 17,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, 4,000 tons of nitrogen oxide and 1,000 tons of particulate matter a year. The increased air pollution without Shoreham, though not responsible for instantaneous fatalities, does the work of terrorists by killing thousands of people slowly over time. The only thing lacking is the drama of an attack like Sept. 11. In addition, the operation of Shoreham would have curtailed the discharge of more than three million tons of carbon dioxide a year, a major cause of global warming. This is why Patrick Moore, a founder and former leader of Greenpeace, sees nuclear energy as the only non-greenhouse-gas-emitting power source capable of effectively replacing fossil fuels and satisfying growing demand. Besides the positive economic impact of lower rates, Shoreham would have produced substantial financial benefits in terms of jobs, taxes, economic output and higher income. Indian Point, alone, contributes $763.3 million a year to Westchester's economy. Sure, there are those who say that they sleep better at night because there is no Shoreham, but this false sense of security is derived from a fear of an extremely unlikely piece of Hollywood fiction. In the real world, without Shoreham, these same people who are sleeping better are waking up to higher utility bills, more polluted air and climate change. The unfortunate history of Shoreham shows us what to expect from an ill-advised closing of Indian Point. I hope the people of Westchester will avoid making a mistake that would compound an already serious energy situation for the region. Matthew C. Cordaro, the former head of a utility, is the director of the Center for Management Analysis at the C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University.",2007-02-11T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,opinion

Sunbathers enjoying the long May Day holiday were aware that the radioactivity of the soil was some 10 times higher than a week earlier, but Swedes have a way of putting things in perspective. Despite Scandinavia's preoccupation with the Soviet nuclear reactor accident, there has been no panic. The main reason, a picnicking grandmother said, is that ''our people have faith in their scientists.'' ''After all,'' she added, ''it's no accident that this is the home of the Nobel Prizes.'' First to Alert the World Swedish scientists were the first to alert the world on Chernobyl, and they have consistently outguessed American and European colleagues in assessing the disaster. Consequently, most Swedes apparently accepted the reassurances of the National Institute of Radiation Protection that despite the radioactive iodine, cesium, neptunium and other isotopes that have drifted over Sweden, there was no cause for panic. But nonetheless the 40 scientists and 100 staff members have had a hard time maintaining calm during the emergency. The institute's main radiological laboratories are housed in a large, modern brick building within the grounds of the Karolinska Institute. And across a busy highway there stands a converted turn-of-the-century courthouse where the scientists confront a rather edgy outer world. In this visitor's center, the physicists, aeronomists, biologists and environmental experts, come face to face with Cabinet ministers, news reporters, the Swedish public and a handful of persistent hecklers. The scientists take their turns with the rest of the staff manning a bank of telephones. When required, they face television cameras. ''Between the phones and our labs across the street, we don't get much time to eat or sleep,'' said the director, Dr. Gunnar Bengtsson, ''but I think we'll be able to go back to normal schedules in about two weeks.'' University Professor on Duty Dr. Jack Valentin, a former university professor who is responsible for monitoring radiation from Swedish nuclear power plants, does his stint answering questions. The Swedish sensors include the latest in acoustic gadgets to ferret out the Soviet submarines often believed hiding in deep Swedish fjords. On the ground, the seismic laboratory at Uppsala tracks Soviet underground nuclear explosions. And in the air, sampling devices continuously sniff for fallout. A week ago, a worker arrived at the Forsmark nuclear power plant on Sweden's east coast, and routinely stuck his feet into the installation's radiation. It set off an alarm heard around the world; the radioactive dust on the worker's shoes, Swedish analysts soon realized, had come not from the Forsmark plant but from the Ukraine. The institute quickly became an international clearing house for radiation information coming from all over Europe. Based on this data, scientists here have issued a series of assessments and forecasts in which they take pride; things turned out as predicted. Other Forecasters Cited Forecasters elsewhere have not been as successful. Last Monday, for instance, an expert at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California told a caller that the radioactive debris reaching Sweden was undoubtedly in the form of xenon and krypton, gases that would disperse quickly. There seemed to be little or no chance, he said, that heavier (and far more dangerous) fallout, notably radioactive iodine, cesium and lanthanum, would travel far enough to reach Scandinavia. Livermore, the principal United States laboratory for nuclear weapons development, studies all accidents involving the release of radiation into the atmosphere. And yet, radioactive iodine, cesium, lanthanum and 10 other fission products from the Soviet reactor have turned up here and worked their way into the soil, luckily in such small amounts that they are considered more or less harmless. (An environmentalist, Bjorn O. Gillberg, told a reporter, however, that he believed the accident would cause an extra 2,000 cancer deaths a year in Sweden.) Among the many visitors this week was Dr. Arthur Tamplin, an American physicist who helped develop the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico and who later became a research division leader at Livermore. For the last two years, he has lived in Uppsala, working as an activist opponent of nuclear power generation. Four Plants in Sweden Sweden has four nuclear power plants of her own, and they are the source of great controversy. Antinuclear activists want them shut down, and a referendum in 1980 called for phasing out nuclear power. The radiation institute's scientists have mixed feelings about the issue. ''This Chernobyl accident has certainly given all of us second thoughts,'' one said. ''At the same time, the alternative to nuclear power is fossil fuel, which produces mutagens that may be far more dangerous in the long run than anything that comes out of nuclear power generation.'' ''You want to know what I would really like?,'' he said. ''I wish to hell we could get people around here to quit smoking.''",1986-05-04T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world

The plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, is under the control of Russian forces. Credit... David Guttenfelder for The New York Times KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant came under renewed shelling on Saturday as fraught negotiations to allow for a team of scientists from the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit the facility took on added urgency. The United Nation’s nuclear watchdog has assembled a team of experts to visit the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southeastern Ukraine — Europe’s largest nuclear power station — as early as next week. A list of the team’s members seen by The New York Times includes the nuclear agency’s chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi of Argentina, and 13 other experts from mostly neutral countries. Neither the United States nor Britain, countries that Russia scorns as unfairly biased because of their strong support for Ukraine, is represented. The I.A.E.A. headquarters in Vienna declined to comment on the planned mission. A spokesman confirmed that the agency was “in active consultations for an imminent I.A.E.A. mission” to the plant. But even as the details of a possible visit to the plant took shape, Russia and Ukraine on Saturday again blamed each other for shelling the facility. Ukraine’s nuclear energy agency, Energoatom, said Russia shelled the plant late Friday and into Saturday morning. It accused Russian forces of increasing pressure on the plant’s staff ahead of a possible I.A.E.A. visit “to prevent them from disclosing evidence about the crimes of the occupiers at the plant and its use as a military base.” Within minutes of Energoatom’s statement, Russia’s Ministry of Defense put out its own statement saying that Ukraine had fired shells at the plant in the past 24 hours. Both the Russians and the Ukrainians said radiation levels remained within normal range. The plant has come under sporadic shelling since early August, although the extent of the damage remains unclear. Critical infrastructure around the plant has also been shelled and on Thursday the plant temporarily lost its off-site electrical power after a critical high-voltage wire was damaged, forcing it to rely on on-site backup power. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in an address to the nation late Friday that the episode had brought it perilously close to disaster, making the need for a visit by international inspectors even more urgent. “I want to emphasize that the situation remains very risky and dangerous,” Mr. Zelensky said. “That is why it is so important that the I.A.E.A. mission arrives at the plant as soon as possible.” Despite mounting international anxiety over a possible catastrophe at the sprawling plant, in the middle of a war zone, Russia and Ukraine have for weeks failed to agree on a plan that would allow inspectors to visit. The shelling is complicating those discussions. The warring nations have haggled over the composition of an inspection team and whether it would travel to the plant through territory occupied by Russian forces or controlled by the government in Kyiv. Ukraine has insisted that the inspectors start out from government-controlled territory, to avoid giving legitimacy to the Russian occupation. That means the inspectors would have to pass through frontline positions where shelling is frequent and would probably use a crossing point already crowded with civilians fleeing the fighting and nuclear dangers. Any deal is likely to require a cease-fire along the route. A senior diplomat familiar with the negotiations said that Russia had given its approval to the inspection team and indicated that it had acceded to Ukraine’s demand that the mission originate in territory it controls rather than in Russian-occupied land. Moscow has said it supports the work of the I.A.E.A., but has ignored pleas to withdraw military forces from the plant and its vicinity to create a demilitarized zone. Russia seized the facility, which comprises six nuclear reactors, in March at the start of its invasion but Ukrainian engineers still operate it. The I.A.E.A. mission includes experts from Poland and Lithuania, nations seen as friendly by Ukraine, but also others from Serbia and China, which Ukraine views with deep suspicion because of their cozy relations with Moscow. The remaining members are from countries that have mostly stood on the sidelines of the war in Ukraine or that have kept channels open with the Kremlin. They include Albania, France, Italy, Jordan, Mexico and North Macedonia. Edwin Lyman, a nuclear power expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that a visit by the I.A.E.A. would allow experts to inspect the state of all the emergency systems as well as the diesel supply, and then make arrangements for replenishing it.",2022-08-27T17:51:40.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

The nuclear fuel has been removed from all of them, and the turbines and other equipment that generated power have mostly been removed. With no operating reactors at the plant, there is no risk of a core meltdown as there would be if an operating plant lost power and could no longer circulate water through the reactor. This is what happened at the Fukushima reactors in Japan in 2011, when an earthquake and tsunami wiped out backup power systems. But Chernobyl carries some other risks related to the large amount of nuclear waste on site. The fuel inside a reactor eventually becomes used up and is replaced. As is common practice in the nuclear power industry, the fuel removed from all four Chernobyl reactors over the years, more than 20,000 assemblies in all, is stored in pools of water that dissipate the heat produced as the fuel decays radioactively. When fuel is newly removed from a reactor and is still highly radioactive, there is a lot of decay and thus a lot of heat, so plants need power to run pumps that circulate the storage water, removing excess heat in the process. If the water in storage tanks got so hot it boiled off, the fuel would be exposed to the air and could catch fire. That, too, was among the risks in the Fukushima disaster. The I.A.E.A. has said that the used fuel assemblies at Chernobyl are old enough and have decayed enough that circulating pumps are not needed to keep them safe. “The heat load of the spent fuel storage pool and the volume of cooling water contained in the pool is sufficient to maintain effective heat removal without the need for electrical supply,” the agency said.",2022-03-10T02:11:27.000+01:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Nuclear power is ''environmentally friendly, affordable, clean, dependable and safe,'' Mrs. Whitman said at a news conference on Monday. She said that as the E.P.A. leader for two and a half years, ending in June 2003, and as governor of New Jersey for seven years, she had promoted various means to reduce the emission of gases that cause global warming and pollution. But Mrs. Whitman said that ''none of them will have as great a positive impact on our environment as will increasing our ability to generate electricity from nuclear power.'' Mrs. Whitman headed the E.P.A. when it published rules for the proposed high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. After she left the office, the courts threw out the rules because they covered only the first 10,000 years of waste storage, while peak releases of radiation were expected after that time. Organizers released a list of 58 companies and institutions and 10 people who they said were members of a new Clean and Safe Energy Coalition, which Mr. Moore said would engage in ''grass-roots advocacy.'' A spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, the trade association of reactor operators, acknowledged that it was providing all of the financing, but would not say what the budget was. Mr. Moore said he favored efficiency and renewable energy, but added that solar cells, which produce electricity from sunlight, were ''being given too much emphasis and taking too much money.'' A dollar spent on geothermal energy, he said, was ''10 to 12 times more effective in reducing greenhouse emissions.'' Mr. Moore is the director of a company that distributes geothermal systems in Canada. He is also a supporter of what he called ''sustainable forestry'' because, he said, building with wood avoided the use of materials whose manufacture releases greenhouse gases, like steel and concrete. Mr. Moore, who left Greenpeace in 1986, favors many technologies that some environmentalists oppose, including the genetic engineering of crops, and has referred to his former colleagues as ''environmental extremists'' and ''anti-human.'' Mr. Moore said Greenpeace was wrong to oppose nuclear energy, which he called essential to reducing global warming gases. Coincidentally, Greenpeace released a report on Monday about 200 failures at American nuclear power plants, which it described as ''near misses,'' since 1986. The report was to mark the 20th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear plant explosion in the former Soviet Union. Mrs. Whitman also referred to Chernobyl, saying people ''still think in terms of Bhopal and Chernobyl.'' A leak at a chemical plant in Bhopal, India, killed more than 2,500 people in December 1984. But nuclear power, she said, ''can be safely and appropriately used to expand our mix.'' Representatives of the United States Chamber of Commerce and the Teamsters also spoke in favor of new reactors.",2006-04-25T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,national-desk

All three reactors, used for research and not to generate power, are at Tuwaitha, a city about 15 miles southeast of Baghdad. The largest, a 40-megawatt reactor made in France and called Tammuz-1, was heavily damaged by Israeli warplanes in June 1981, and has not been rebuilt. It reportedly contained roughly 26 pounds of bomb-grade uranium, enough for one crude nuclear bomb. That uranium was recovered and has been periodically inspected since then by the International Atomic Energy Agency, most recently in November. Two remaining reactors are much smaller. The first, a French model called Tammuz-2, uses the Tammuz-1 fuel and generates 500 to 800 kilowatts of power. The second, called the IRT-5000, generates 5 to 10 megawatts of power and contains about 17.5 pounds of bomb-grade uranium which was also inspected in November. Doubts About Fate of Fuel Leonard Spector, a nuclear-proliferation expert and senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, expressed doubt that the bomb-grade fuel in those reactors had been destroyed in air raids. ""That fuel was there when it was inspected in November,"" he said. ""But it's past January 15, and I'd be surprised if the fuel were in still either reactor. I don't want to overemphasize it, but it's a loose end now, and we've got to keep track of where it goes."" The fallout danger of bombing the Tuwaitha reactors is small, Mr. Spector said. The plants contain only a few pounds of uranium, compared to the tons used in commercial reactors, he said, and the uranium is not highly radioactive. But the political consequences loom large, he said, because the two operating reactors are the first ever attacked in war. Also at Tuwaitha are research and production facilities that could be used in a nuclear-weapons program. They include a research laboratory, a plant that fabricates fuel for nuclear reactors, and a plant of Italian origin that could extract plutonium -- the key components of a bomb type not being pursued by Iraq -- from spent nuclear-reactor fuel. Since Iraq has little or no spent fuel, its utility in a bomb program is questionable. Just south of Baghdad, apparently in the town of Tadji, is a facility called Factory 10 where Iraqi researchers are building prototypes of gas centrifuges, a critical component in that nation's bomb program. The centrifuges spin at extremely high speeds to separate atoms uranium 235, which can be split in a nuclear chain reaction from atoms of the more stable uranium 238.

Reported Requests for Help West German and Swedish officials said advice and help was being sought from industry and scientific organizations, in the form of technical equipment, trained personnel, and know-how in methods of battling graphite fires and dealing with intense radioactive contamination. They said it appeared to indicate that the fire, evidently in connection with a partial or total reactor-core meltdown, continued out of control. The accident, which Western diplomats said evidently occurred last weekend or earlier, sent an immense cloud of radioactivity, measured by Swedish experts at roughly 100 times normal levels, across Northern European countries. West German officials said they were coordinating a search for technical advice from chemical companies, like Bayer A.G. and Hoechst A.G., that are major suppliers of graphite, and for assistance in supplying technical equipment, such as remote-control robots, and trained personnel from organizations such as Germany's Nuclear Technology Assistance Service, a kind of fire brigade maintained by the nuclear-power industry to deal with serious accidents. But officials in both countries said they were hampered by a lack of information, and were limited in the type of assistance they could offer because of the absence in their countries of the type of reactor, using graphite components, involved in Chernobyl. West Germany and Sweden are world leaders in the manufacture and maintenance of nuclear power generating equipment. Germany operates 20 nuclear power stations and 5 more are in the planning stage. But only one uses graphite. Margareta Hallencreutz, an official at the Swedish Nuclear Inspection Board in Stockholm, said a Soviet Embassy third technical secretary sought ''technical advice'' in talks today with five officials of the Swedish agency. But she said the diplomat ''did not know the reason'' for the fire and ''did not know the extent of the damage done.'' Frigyes Reich, a Board member, was quoted earlier as saying that ''the nuclear plant's graphite moderator is burning and the core of the reactor has melted, in part or even completely.'' Report Called 'Speculation' But Mrs. Hallencreutz said that was ''speculation.'' ''We just do not know,'' she said. Adolf Birkhofer, director of the West German Society for Reactor Safety and a leading European expert, said the presence of elements such as Cesium 134 and Cesium 137 in the atmosphere appeared to indicate a partial or total meltdown, of the reactor core and its possible exposure to air. ''Evidently there was a loss of coolant, and a malfunctioning of the reserve capacity,'' Mr. Birkhofer said in a telephone interview. Exposure would have led to a graphite-oxygen reaction and subsequent smoldering, he said. Mr. Birkhofer described the disaster as a ''design-basis accident,'' indicating that safety systems had evidently proven insufficient. Asked whether it could be considered the most serious such accident ever, he replied, ''Yes, judging by available information.'' Experience With Graphite Fires Mrs. Hallencreutz said Sweden was able to give no technical advice, but referred the Soviet official to countries, such as the United States, Britain and Switzerland, which had experience in dealing with graphite fires. Officials of the German Atom Forum in Bonn, an organization linking industries and scientific groups involved in atomic energy, said they met for two to three hours this morning with a Soviet Embassy ''scientific official'' to coordinate contacts with companies and organizations capable of supplying aid. A spokesman said the organizations included the Nuclear Technology Assistance Service, the German Nuclear Energy Research Center in Julich, west of Bonn, and the Society for Reactor Safety, in Cologne. Team of Experts Available Wolfgang Neumann, technical director of the Nuclear Technology Assistance Service, which is operated jointly by utilities that run atomic power plants, said it had available a team of about 133 trained experts, as well as specialized equipment, including four remote-control robots and other machinery used in handling reactor accidents involving high radioactivity. Mr. Neumann said the Nuclear Technology Assistance Service could also supply equipment, such as suits amd containers, to shield against radiation, that could be flown to the Soviet Union. But he said further detailed information about the accident was neeeded before officials could decide what form of aid was necessary. He said Soviet Embassy officials in Bonn promised to supply further information, but had not yet done so. At the same time, the Soviet Union was reported to be seeking assistance from individual companies. Officials of Brown Boveri, in Mannheim, West Germany, a subsidiary of the Swiss engineering company of the same name, said Soviet representatives had asked it for expert advice.",1986-04-30T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk-world

But recent setbacks in a hoped-for “nuclear renaissance” raise questions about how much of a role nuclear power can play. Of four reactor projects identified by the Energy Department in 2009 as the most likely candidates for federal loan guarantees, only two are moving forward . At a third, in Calvert Cliffs, Md., there has been no public sign of progress since the lead partner withdrew in October and the other partner said it would seek a replacement. And at the fourth , in Texas, a would-be builder has been driven to try something never done before in nuclear construction: finding a buyer for the electricity before the concrete is even poured. Customers are not rushing forward, given that the market is awash in generating capacity and an alternative fuel, natural gas, is currently cheap. “The short answer is, there has to be a market for the power,” said John Reed, an investment banker who specializes in nuclear projects. “That’s the most immediate hurdle these projects have to get over.” Yet there is a fairly sturdy political consensus in favor of building more reactors. By including nuclear power in a proposed “clean energy standard” shifting the electric system away from conventional coal and gas, whose emissions contribute to global warming, the Obama administration is seeking to stoke such support. Many Democrats and most Republicans in Congress back nuclear construction, as do local officials in most places where reactors have been proposed. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and one of the Senate’s strongest proponents of nuclear power, suggests that Mr. Obama should make building 100 reactors in the next 20 years a national priority, both for energy security and to limit climate-changing emissions. But for now, he acknowledges, the economics are not in place. “Right now, it’s stuck,” he said of the planned nuclear revival. Some challenges are not peculiar to the nuclear sector. All forms of clean energy, including solar and wind power, are undercut to some extent by the cheap price of natural gas and the surplus in generating capacity, which is linked partly to the recession. And federal caps on carbon dioxide emissions from coal- and gas-burning plants, which would benefit clean energy sources, are not expected until 2012. But some obstacles are specific to the nuclear industry, like the ballooning cost estimates for construction of reactors, which are massive in scale. Even when projects are identified as prime candidates for federal loan guarantees, some investment partners turn wary. “All that uncertainty creates an incentive for you to wait,” said Joseph E. Aldy, who was a special assistant to President Obama until December. To counter the uncertainties, Senator Alexander and others have arranged substantial help for the industry. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been working for more than 15 years to streamline reactor licensing to cut construction time and to reduce risk. And the 2005 Energy Policy Act provided money for loan guarantees, subsidies for production from the first few reactors and insurance against regulatory delays. Industry executives say that with those changes and the financial help, they had what they needed to build after a gap of three decades. By 2008, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had 15 applications for new nuclear plants in hand and expected 15 more, and it asked Congress for budget increases for personnel to handle the flood. Across from commission headquarters, in Rockville, Md., workers are now digging a foundation for a $131 million, 14-story office tower for 1,500 employees to handle an anticipated flood of applications. But many of the proposed reactors are fading. The four projects identified by the Energy Department after the 2005 act as the strongest candidates to share an $18.5 billion pool of loan guarantee money underline the difficulties. At the Southern Company’s Vogtle 3 & 4 reactors , near Augusta, Ga., two holes that are each as big as five football fields have been dug for the foundations, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is expected to grant a license to build and operate the plants this year. But negotiations on the Calvert Cliffs 3 project in Maryland broke down over what fee the builders should pay to the federal government to compensate the Treasury for the risk it was underwriting. One partner, Constellation Energy of Baltimore, gave up, and the other, Électricité de France, has not found a new investor. Preliminary work has begun at another site, the Virgil C. Summer 2 and 3 project of South Carolina Electric and Gas, although one of the municipal partners, Santee Cooper, is looking for another company to take over some of its share. The fate of the fourth, the South Texas Project 3 and 4, has been uncertain since CPS Energy, the municipal utility that serves San Antonio, was spooked by rising cost estimates and decided to bail out. CPS settled with the other partner, NRG of Princeton, for 7.6 percent ownership in exchange for the money it had already invested; for months, NRG has been shopping for partners to replace CPS. The Tokyo Electric Power Company has agreed to take on 10 percent if the project gets a loan guarantee from the Energy Department, but before the project can move forward it needs either more investors or utilities that will sign contracts to accept the power for 20 years or more. David Crane, NRG’s chief executive, said in a telephone interview that he was “cautiously optimistic” that he would eventually find customers that would agree to take power for 10 or 20 years, beginning in 2017. “I don’t find many people willing to believe that gas is going to be almost free forever,” he said. In the 1960s and 1970s, when utilities decided to build the 104 plants now operating, they did not sell the output with power purchase agreements before the plants came online, because in that era, companies simply built to supply their own customers, who did not have a choice of suppliers. But if the South Texas Project expansion is built, it would be the first in a state using a restructured electric system with open bidding, a system that now covers more than half the country. South Texas 3 and 4 and Calvert Cliffs 3 were supposed to help break a 30-year drought and get the ball rolling for construction of dozens of new reactors. But prospects for weaker ones are fading. AmerenUE proposed a reactor adjacent to its existing Callaway plant in Missouri that would have been an identical twin to Constellation Energy’s Calvert Cliffs 3 in Maryland, but that fizzled after the Missouri legislature refused to let the company collect money from ratepayers before the plant was finished. Michael J. Wallace, who led Constellation’s five-year effort to build Calvert Cliffs 3, said that more help would have to come for the industry to bounce back. “We need to take stock again,” he said. “If we don’t sort this out in some way, there isn’t going to be a nuclear revival.”",2011-02-01T03:38:08.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

Repeating the same demands that led to the collapse of talks five weeks ago, North Korea insisted Tuesday that it had the right to maintain a peaceful nuclear energy program after it dismantles its nuclear bombs, and that the United States must acknowledge that right in advance.- While some analysts held out hope that the issue could be finessed so that the six nations participating in the negotiations could at least agree on a statement of principles for future discussions, several diplomats warned that even such an interim step seemed insurmountable in the current environment. The standoff is a heavy burden for the Bush administration, which has failed to slow North Korea's nuclear program since it accused the country of violating a previous pact in 2002 and vowed to take a tougher line than the Clinton administration had. The Stalinist North Korean government expelled United Nations weapons inspectors in 2002 and now says it has working nuclear bombs, which it says it needs to protect itself from the ''hostile policy'' of the United States. Administration officials have put new emphasis on negotiating with the North and have relaxed earlier demands that the country disarm itself unilaterally before they would consider offering diplomatic or economic incentives. But some analysts say they fear that North Korea does not intend to give up its weapons program, which its leaders view as a cornerstone of their security and a bargaining chip to demand economic aid for its ailing economy. China is the host of the current talks, which include South Korea, Japan and Russia as well as the United States and North Korea, and are a continuation of a previous, marathon round of talks in early August that ended in frustration. Although the United States and North Korea continued back-channel discussions during the intervening five-week period, they apparently did not bridge many differences. ''I can't say there has been much progress'' during the recess, Christopher Hill, the chief American envoy to the talks, said shortly after his arrival in Beijing on Tuesday afternoon. ''We will have to talk to see where we are.'' Mr. Hill said that rather than focusing on how to reduce existing disagreements, the North Koreans had added new obstacles. ''Their position seems to be evolving a little,'' he said. The talks formally got under way on Tuesday afternoon. There is no scheduled conclusion date. Kim Gye Gwan, the country's top nuclear negotiator, told the New China News Agency on Tuesday that North Korea must have reactors for nuclear energy. North Korea ''has a right to have peaceful nuclear activity,'' Mr. Kim said before boarding his flight to Beijing at the airport in Pyongyang, the capital. ''This right is neither awarded nor needs approval by others.'' The Bush administration argues that North Korea has no need for nuclear power plants. Washington has supported an offer by South Korea to build several nuclear or conventional power plants near its border with North Korea to provide energy if the North agrees to denuclearize. Administration officials say that North Korea violated a 1994 pact with the Clinton administration when it used a nuclear power plant to produce plutonium for atomic bombs and so cannot now be trusted with any kind of nuclear technology. ''Nuclear weapons, nuclear programs are not something that one should leave in an ambiguous state,'' Mr. Hill told reporters before leaving Washington. ''North Korea has trouble keeping its peaceful programs peaceful.'' The peaceful use issue raises delicate questions for the United States because China, Russia and South Korea have all argued that they see no reason why North Korea cannot retain civilian nuclear plants. Only Japan has backed the American position. That suggests that the issue is an effective one for North Korea if its main purpose in the talks is to isolate the United States from the other parties. In that way, the North might escape blame for the failure of the talks while maintaining relatively cordial relations with its neighbors. Chinese analysts say they have low expectations for this round, arguing that neither the United States nor North Korea has enough confidence in the other to reach an agreement that will require some level of trust.",2005-09-14T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk

But the federal laboratory that conducted a major test cited by the experts says its experiment was not meant to demonstrate anything about reactors' structural soundness. The 19 experts, many of them retired, work or worked at universities or companies that build or operate reactors. In an article on Friday in the journal Science, they dismiss fears voiced by opponents of nuclear power that the nation's reactors are vulnerable to a terrorist attack. ''We read that airplanes can fly through the reinforced, steel-lined 1.5-meter-thick concrete walls surrounding a nuclear reactor,'' the article says, ''and inevitably cause a meltdown resulting in 'tens of thousands of deaths' and 'make a huge area uninhabitable for centuries,' to quote some recent stories.'' But, they add, ''no airplane regardless of size, can fly through such a wall.'' The article says the scenario ''was actually tested in 1988 by mounting an unmanned plane on rails and 'flying' it at 215 meters per second (about 480 m.p.h.) into a test wall.'' The engines penetrated only about two inches and the fuselage even less, according to the article. But the relevance of the test, conducted at Sandia National Laboratories, has long been in dispute. People who opposed nuclear power before Sept. 11 pointed out that the test wall moved several feet; the movement reduced the damage by absorbing some of the force of impact. At Sandia, a spokesman, John German, said the point of the test was to move the wall, as a way to measure the impact forces. The test was sponsored by the Muto Institute of Structural Mechanics Inc., of Tokyo, as a preliminary step in building a computer model of such impacts, but the Japanese decided not to sponsor the next step, Mr. German said. Asked if it showed that a plane could not penetrate a dome, he said, ''We've been trying like heck to shoot down this rumor.'' Mr. German said: ''That test was designed to measure the impact force of a fighter jet. But the wall was not being tested. No structure was being tested.'' The nuclear experts contend that the test makes their point nevertheless. The opponents of nuclear power have argued that the plane in the Sandia test, an F-4 Phantom, weighs far less than a jumbo jet. But James Muckerheide, a nuclear engineer who is the co-director of the Center for Nuclear Technology and Society at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, on whose work the authors relied, said in an e-mail response to a reporter's question that penetrating a reactor containment building would take far more than an airliner. Compared with the F-4, Mr. Muckerheide said, ''a large passenger aircraft is a slow, empty, tin can.'' ''The mass of the aircraft can put a heavy compression load on the containment structure,'' he said, ''but it has negligible penetrating ability.'' The containment building can withstand huge compression loads, he argued. The fact that the block in the Sandia test moved had a trivial effect, Mr. Muckerheide said. Whether a containment building is the soft spot of a nuclear plant is also not clear. Most of the radioactivity in a power plant is in the spent fuel pool, which, critics note, is usually in a building that is far less sturdy. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is conducting an engineering analysis of the vulnerability of power plants to aircraft attack, Sue Gagner, an agency spokeswoman, said. ''If warranted by the ongoing detailed analysis, we will consider changes,'' Ms. Gagner said. Articles in Science, like those in many scientific journals, are reviewed before publication by experts not connected with the authors. But the magazine's editor in chief, Donald Kennedy, said that if there was a difference between the authors and the group that performed the experiment, ''they're going to thrash it out in our letters column, and we'll let them do it.'' The magazine is published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. THREATS AND RESPONSES: REACTOR VULNERABILITY",2002-09-20T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

Six years later, Britain is having second thoughts.

Japan is rapidly outpacing the United States in the field of nuclear power, American experts in Government, academia and the utility industry say. Japan's advantages are widening in research and development, in construction techniques and in safe operation of the plants, according to a team of seven experts who recently returned from a National Science Foundation trip to Japan. Even in the areas of nuclear-plant design, where American companies are making progress, the improvements will first make their way from blueprint to steel and concrete in plants built in Japan. Several of the experts compared the loss of American leadership in nuclear power - a technology invented and first commercialized in the United States - to the fate of the American computer and auto industries, which are threatened by Japanese inventions and manufacturing advances. Members of the team returning from Japan noted at a conference here this week the long hiatus in orders for nuclear plants in this country and said the American losses were becoming harder to reverse. ''The infrastructure required to build nuclear plants in the United States is slowly dwindling,'' said Kent F. Hansen, a professor of nuclear engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the chairman of the group. ''Without more projects, our ability to build them as cheaply as others will suffer.'' The last order for a nuclear power plant in the United States was in 1978, and since then utilities in this country have canceled about 65. In the same period, Japan has broken ground for 23 reactors. Japan has 37 operating, compared with 111 in this country. It has 12 plants under construction; this country has 5, all mostly completed. Kevin D. Burke, an international relations specialist at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said in a telephone interview that a late start gives Japan a natural advantage. ''They've been able to look at the other nuclear programs in the world and, in many ways, improve on them, learning from the operating experience of the French program, the German program and the American program,'' he said. ''It's unfair to say in black and white that their program is better; it should be better.'' Revival Sought in U.S. Supporters of nuclear power hope American orders will revive in the middle of this decade, spurred by new designs and changes in the system for building and licensing plants. Two American manufacturers, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the General Electric Company, are designing advanced plants in work supported by the Government, and applying to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for generic approval. The idea is that utilities could win quick permission for a new plant by picking one of the approved designs rather than custom-designing, as has been the case in the past. Still, the first copies of both companies' new plants are likely to be built in Japan, the experts said. Building those models here successfully would require learning from the experience of the Japanese, said Loring Mills, a nuclear specialist of the Edison Electric Institute, the utility trade association. ''If we don't find a way to build new plants in the next four or five years like they do, we're not going to build them,'' he predicted. More Important in Japan But experts at the conference here were quick to point out that nuclear power is far more important for Japan, which has virtually no indigenous energy resources and a strong desire for energy independence, than for the United States, which can burn native coal for most of its electricity and is content to import oil and natural gas for much of the remainder. Experts made these points about the deterioration of the United States leadership in nuclear power: * Construction of a nuclear plant averages 5 years in Japan, compared with 11 in this country. Because designs are better developed before construction in Japan, a Japanese plant requires only half as many hours of work by skilled craftsmen as does an American one of the same size. And Japanese builders guarantee the prices, eliminating ballooning costs on the way to completion. * Operation is smoother in Japan, with unplanned shutdowns coming only one-tenth as often as in American plants, on average. Japanese plants ran at 72.3 percent of capacity last year, compared with 63.3 percent in this country. The level of radioactivity in the cooling water in Japanese nuclear plants is 500 times smaller than in American plants, and the radiation dose to plant workers is 10 to 15 times smaller. * Research and development has produced more advances in many areas in Japan. Among them: computers in some control rooms that respond to the spoken commands of operators and run a growing range of systems automatically. Researchers are making progress toward a new nuclear fuel that will last substantially longer than the current nine months, which would allow a longer interval between refueling shutdowns. And researchers are beginning work on a ''self healing'' plant that will diagnose its own problems and send robots to fix them. Attention to Detail The team spent a week in Japan last month, visiting 17 agencies, institutions and companies. The visit was part of a series organized by the National Science Foundation's Japanese Technology Evaluation Center, based at Loyola College in Baltimore, to evaluate Japanese progress in such fields as biotechnology, telecommunications and superconductivity. As with assessments in other areas, the nuclear team found that the United States retains a lead in some areas. For example, the Japanese rely heavily on computer codes developed in this country to simulate various reactor conditions, and the American lead in the field is growing. But the team found that patience and attention to detail were propelling Japan toward leadership in still another field. From a distance, Japanese reactors are similar to American ones, on which they are based, said Donald R. Olander, a professor of nuclear engineering at the University of California at Berkeley. ''They are very similar, much as a Nissan pickup truck is similar to a Ford Ranger,'' he said. ''But there are small differences which make an enormous difference.'' These, he said, are reflected in higher reliability. New Developments a Factor In building their own industry, the Japanese have taken advantage of numerous technological developments not available when most American plants were planned, the panel said. These include computer-assisted design, advanced computers for controlling plant processes, fiber-optic communications channels, increased fabrication of large parts in shops instead of in the field, and new construction materials. Some innovations are not Japanese, but have been perfected in Japan, said Dr. Hansen of M.I.T. ''The heaviest-lifting crane is a U.S. design,'' he said. ''They have several of them there and know more about how to use them than we do.'' In addition, Dr. Hansen said, the Japanese construction industry spends $800 million a year, about 0.54 percent of sales, on research and development of new techniques, some of which can be applied to nuclear plants. By contrast, the United States industry invests $50 million, or 0.04 percent of sales. Japan also outspends the United States on research and development for advanced reactors, by $775 million a year to $187.5 million, and on research for the current generation of reactors, by $291 million to $180 million. Both figures exclude proprietary research by companies. More Scholarly Papers The nuclear programs of Japanese universities are well supported, the panelists said, and Japanese scientists in academia, industry and the national laboratories publish nearly twice as many scholarly papers on nuclear materials as Americans do. Some research is in areas this country has rejected. The Japanese industry has pursued a reactor for ship propulsion, even though it does not think such a reactor will be commercially attractive any time soon, the experts said. In addition, the industry is pursuing plans to recover and re-use the plutonium fuel created in the operation of existing reactors, a step rejected in this country because it could lead to the spread of nuclear weapons. Japan is also building a ''breeder'' reactor, which makes nuclear fuel faster than it uses it up. While the United States is unlikely to move to a breeder system, with extensive supplies of uranium available cheaply, this country would benefit from a more long-term, safety-oriented approached to the technology, the experts said. But one of the panelists, Victor H. Ransom, a scientific and engineering fellow at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, said that while the United States nuclear industry would benefit from adopting the Japanese drive toward quality and reliability, the drive arose not from technology but culture. Regulation is less contentious in Japan, he said, because the Ministry of International Trade and Industry trusts ''that the utilities will actually do the right thing.'' ''The same system probably would not work here,'' he said. ''There are enough organizations that have stayed within the law but have done everything on the basis of economics,'' scrimping on expenditures that would mean long-term savings.",1990-02-27T01:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business

Credit... Sergei Ilnitsky/EPA, via Shutterstock Russian soldiers who control a giant nuclear power plant in Ukraine are detaining workers and subjecting them to brutal interrogations in a search for possible saboteurs, prompting many employees to leave and raising concerns about safety, Ukrainian officials say. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant — Europe’s largest — lies in southern Ukraine in the city of Enerhodar on the eastern side of the Dnipro River, across from territory still held by Ukrainian forces. With 11,000 workers, the plant occupies a strategically important spot, and safety concerns at the plant make any Ukrainian counteroffensive to retake the area particularly complicated. Russian forces have fortified the outside of the plant with trenches and heavy artillery, and inside they are stepping up measures to find anyone they think might pose a threat, according to local and company officials. “People are being abducted en masse,” Enerhodar’s exiled mayor, Dmytro Orlov, said during a meeting on Wednesday with officials from Energoatom, the state company that oversees the complex. “The whereabouts of some of them are unknown. The rest are in very difficult conditions: They are being tortured and physically and morally abused.” Mr. Orlov said in an interview with a local radio station this week that many plant employees and other residents were trying to escape to Ukrainian-held territory. “Even young people are leaving the city,” he said. “It is unclear who will operate the nuclear power plant.” Mr. Orlov’s statements could not be independently confirmed. But officials from Energoatom have offered similar accounts based on interviews with workers at the plant, and witnesses in other occupied parts of Ukraine have relayed similar reports of mass detentions of civilians. At the same meeting, Petro Kotin, the acting president of Energoatom, said that the plant’s “seizure and gradual transformation into a military base with many weapons and explosives” amounted to an act of “nuclear terrorism.” He said the company would continue to support its employees in occupied territories in every way it could. Last month, Mr. Kotin raised concerns about the Russian militarization of the facility. “Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is a well-fortified facility even in peacetime,” he said. “It is a perfect military base. Moreover, the Russians understand that the amount of nuclear material that is located there protects them. Ukraine will not strike at such an object.” Enerhodar, like other the Russia-occupied areas in the south, has been the scene of attacks by a growing resistance movement in southern Ukraine — with civilians known as partisans engaged in violence against occupying forces, civil disobedience and efforts to help the Ukrainian military — and reprisals by Russian forces. Tensions in the city escalated on May 22, when Andrii Shevchyk, whom the Russians had installed as mayor, was injured in a bombing outside his apartment. He was airlifted to Crimea for medical treatment. The next day, according to Energoatom, an employee of the nuclear power plant was shot several times at his home by Russian forces. This week, Vladimir Rogov, a Russian proxy on the main governing council for the Zaporizka region, which includes the nuclear plant, said in television interview that it was time to institute the death penalty for “war criminals.” Ivan Federov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol who has become something of an unofficial spokesman for Ukrainian resistance in the region, estimated on Tuesday that Russian forces had detained about 500 locals in his home city alone. His claim could not be independently verified because Russia tightly controls access to occupied territories. People living there regularly have their cellphones inspected by Russian forces at checkpoints and during searches of their homes, according to witnesses, making communication with outsiders exceedingly risky. Mr. Federov was himself kidnapped by Russian forces before being released, part of a pattern that has played out in towns and villages including Enerhodar. Ivan Samoidyuk, the first deputy mayor of Enerhodar, has been in Russian custody for over three months, according to Ukrainian officials. As Russia steps up its repression, the Ukrainian government has promised a large counteroffensive and has told everyone who can flee occupied territories to leave before it begins.",2022-06-23T10:35:43.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Hyman G. Rickover was a man who rose from humble origins to the highest levels of government to make great contributions to the nation. But to his son, he was also a man who, senile toward the end of his life, was exploited by people around him. Admiral Rickover, an early proponent of nuclear-generated electricity who became known as the father of the nuclear navy, died Tuesday in nearby Arglington, Va., at 86 years of age. He was buried today in a small, private ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. But his disputatious nature seems certain to survive him in what can be regarded, in a way, as a peculiarly Washington disagreement. Elsewhere, a person's death might lead to a fight over the money in an estate. Here, disputes frequently arise over the legacy of another kind: the assessment of a person's role in the nation and the person's place in history. Interview in Toronto In an interview Wednesday at his home in Toronto, Admiral Rickover's son, Robert M. Rickover, asserted that the admiral, while mentally incapable, was induced to support the much-disputed restarting of a reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, which had been shut down after an adjoining reactor was damaged in a 1979 accident near Harrisburg, Pa. In return, the younger Mr. Rickover said, the company that operates the Three Mile Island reactors gave donations totaling $380,000 to an educational foundation the admiral had formed. The younger Mr. Rickover further said that the company, General Public Utilities, gained his father's endorsement even though the admiral had come to oppose nuclear power plants for their potential danger and the problem of disposing of nuclear waste. In response, General Public Utilities, the head of Admiral Rickover's foundation and a scientist who worked with the admiral at Three Mile Island all denied the son's assertions. In fact, they said, the admiral was not exploited and was not senile and remained supportive of nuclear power. Joann P. DiGennaro, the head of Admiral Rickover's foundation, particularly disputed the assertion that the admiral was not capable of assessing nuclear safety issues. Although he might have had lapses of memory, she said, ''I will say he was not senile.'' The chairman of General Public Utilities, William G. Kuhns, said of the son's charges, ''Why, at the time of his father's death, when he is unable to reply, does this matter come up?'' Robert Rickover, an economist, and his wife, Jane, a writer, addressed that question in the interview. ''What we are saying is an act of love, in support of his principles,'' Mrs. Rickover said of her father-in-law. Her husband put in, ''As his son, I am interested in seeing his reputation safeguarded.'' This reputation, Mr. Rickover asserted, should consist of a record that showed his father's leadership in the development of nuclear power and an evolving belief later that ''mankind was going to destroy itself with nuclear arms.'' Alternatively, Mr. Rickover said, the admiral feared that nuclear power plant accidents would destroy the world, a concern that the younger man said he shared. It was this belief that the son said was improperly pushed aside by people who exploited his father and got him to endorse the restarting at Three Mile Island. ''He was ruthlessly exploited at a time when he was not mentally competent,'' Mr. Rickover said. ''For a few hundred thousand dollars -that didn't go to him - he was ruthlessly exploited over the very issue that was paramount to him.'' That paramount issue was nuclear safety, something that Admiral Rickover bullied people over when he was a younger man but something that his son says he was not capable of assessing in his declining years. Mrs. Rickover said that Mrs. DiGennaro was among those who manipulated Admiral Rickover. But Mrs. DiGennaro suggested that Mr. Rickover's statements since his father's death reflected the younger man's own antinuclear philosophies and strains in the father-son relationship. ''I don't know how to respond to a son who says that,'' Mrs. DiGennaro said, ''except to say that I wish he had seen his father more often.'' At the time of his involvement at Three Mile Island, Mr. Rickover asserted, his father no longer had the mental ability to assess the operation of a nuclear power plant. And, he said, after the reactor was restarted, in October 1985, the utility's contributions to his foundation ceased. Mr. Kuhns, the General Public Utilities chairman, said of the admiral: ''He was not senile, though I am not an expert. He did have occasional lapses of short-term memory. I am appalled that his son felt that way. I don't know how often he saw him; maybe he saw him during his periods of memory loss. He would tire toward the end of the day.'' Mr. Kuhns also said he was appalled by the younger Mr. Rickover's statement that his father felt that nuclear power plants ought to be scrapped. Mr. Kuhns said Admiral Rickover never expressed a view that the plants ought to be scrapped, and he said the admiral took an active role at Three Mile Island. Mrs. DiGennaro said, ''His father did not oppose nuclear power; he opposed the sloppy use of it.'' Asked whether his company had exploited Admiral Rickover, Mr. Kuhns said it had not. ''How do you exploit Admiral Rickover?'' he asked, alluding to the admiral's well-earned reputation for dominating any situation he found himself in. ''I had enormous respect for this man. He was just a super man. Certainly, as he aged, I saw the signs. But he was rational. He was focusing on doing the job.'' Mr. Kuhns acknowledged that his company had made the $25,000 monthly payments to Admiral Rickover's foundation and that they had been reduced and then halted when the reactor was restarted. Mr. Kuhns was asked if the payments represented a quid pro quo, a payment to Admiral Rickover's foundation in return for a favorable finding. 'Absolutely Not' ''You don't buy Admiral Rickover,'' Mr. Kuhns answered. ''We were paying money in anticipation of his work and report. Are you saying that we bought a favorable report? Absolutely not.'' Asked whether the $380,000 in payments were excessive, he said he did not regard them so. Robert V. Laney, one of the scientists recruited by Admiral Rickover to serve with him on a committee assessing the ability of General Public Utilities to manage Three Mile Island, supported Mr. Kuhns. Asked if he would say that Admiral Rickover was mentally competent at the time of the Three Mile Island inquiry, Mr. Laney answered, ''Yes, I would.'' Admiral Rickover took an active part in the scientists' discussions, Mr. Laney said, adding, ''He was very much in the land of the living.'' A memorial service for Admiral Rickover is to be held Monday at the National Cathedral. His son did not attend the small burial service today. He said he had said his own goodbyes to his father last week.",1986-07-11T07:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,national-desk-u.s.

As this weekend began, the plant was under repair - a situation common to the industry - but was expected to be ready to start operations as early as tomorrow. The part under repair is a seal on a pump that recirculates cooling water in the containment building. The pump motor is connected by a shaft to an impeller inside the cooling system, and the seal is around the shaft, preventing the cooling water, which is under hundreds of pounds of pressure, from leaking out. According to John Leonard, the Long Island Lighting Company's vice president for nuclear operations, the plant is designed so that if cooling water - which is mildly radioactive when a reactor is at full power - were to leak, it would drain into a tank designed for the purpose. The work was undertaken when the plant completed ''cold criticality'' testing, or operation at up to .001 percent power, which was authorized by the commission last year. Such pump seal leaks are a common cause of plant shutdowns. Lilco decided to undertake the repair, Mr. Leonard said in a telephone interview last week, when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission acted to delay the effective date of its order giving Shoreham a low-power license until tomorrow. Suffolk and New York State are contending that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission never fairly heard their case and that low-power testing should not commence until there is a settlement of the impasse on emergency planning that threatens to block full-power operation. If the courts do not uphold the county and state, under the order approved earlier this month by a 4-1 vote, the commission's staff will be free to issue the low-power permit. The staff has not disclosed any reason to delay. To begin operations, the technicians at Shoreham would gently lower partway out of the reactor core the 12-foot-long control rods that block the flow of subatomic particles called neutrons between the 130 tons of pellets of uranium. When enough uranium is exposed - the step at which ''critical mass'' is achieved - a self-sustaining reaction develops, with enough neutrons being given off to gradually increase the number of uranium atoms being split. As the power level - or amount of heat generated by nuclear fission - increases, the operators have two ways to limit the reaction. The first is to push the rods back up to the top of the core. But this means that the uranium at the top of each 12-foot rod would be ''burned,'' or fissioned, while the uranium below would go unused. The result would be that when full-power operation began, heat production would be uneven, with much of the fuel at the top of the core already used up. The other control mechanism is to use the cooling water itself to control the speed of the reaction. The water in a nuclear reactor, which is highly purified drinking water, with some chemicals added to control corrosion, performs an important function in addition to cooling. It also ''moderates'' the neutrons emitted by uranium atoms, slowing them down to the speed that is required for splitting the next atom. But the moderating properties of water change according to its density. Liquid water is a good moderator, but gaseous water - or steam - is not. As water boils in the core, the steam bubbles that take the place of liquid water reduce the moderating capacity. A second control method, therefore, is to regulate the proportion of steam to liquid water. If the pumps that recirculate the cooling water run faster, then the amount of steam in the core decreases, and the reactor runs hotter. If the pumps slow down, the steam increases, and the chain reaction slows down. This self-dampening principle is considered by General Electric, Shoreham's manufacturer, as an aid to safety in a boiling water reactor. The phenomenon does not exist to the same extent in reactors like the two at Indian Point, because they do not boil water in the nuclear core. Instead, their cooling water is kept under pressure to keep from boiling, and pumped through a heat exchanger to give off its heat to a second system of water pipes. The amount of steam that Shoreham would produce at low power - substantial in relation to the output of most non-nuclear power plants but small relative to a nuclear generating station - is probably too small to overcome the inertia of its turbine, which is normally not spun until steam output reaches about 20 percent of capacity. The turbine is designed to spin at 3,600 revolutions a minute. While waiting for operation to begin, a special turning gear is used to spin it one turn every few minutes, so that the rotor does not sag. According to Mr. Leonard, Lilco would like to spin the turbine on 5 percent power if possible, to detect problems early. ''Suppose you picked up a significant turbine vibration problem,'' he said, ''and all of a sudden everything cleared up and you were allowed to go to 100 percent power.'' Other equipment to be tested at low power includes the high pressure coolant injection pumps, pumps that are powered by steam and would come on first in an emergency to add cooling water to the core, and the pumps that pull steam through the condenser, where water from Long Island Sound is used to turn the steam back into water for another trip through the reactor. Still other parts of the 809-megawatt, $4.2 billion plant must wait for the production of steam at levels above 5 percent to be tested. The length of time needed for a boiling water reactor to complete the tests possible at 5 percent power differs from plant to plant. During a session before the five commissioners on Feb. 8, called to allow Suffolk County and New York State to make their case against Shoreham, Ralph Caruso, the commission's ''project manager'' for Shoreham, said that the range was 18 days to 91 days. Exempted from that range were two plants where it was discovered after the low-power license was issued that the facility was different in significant details from the way it was described in the engineering studies and the licenses. Those plants, Diablo Canyon in Avila Beach, Calif., and Grand Gulf, in Port Gibson, Miss., were delayed for months while plant engineers and others from the commission double-checked the implications of the differences.",1985-02-24T07:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,long-island-weekly-desk-new-york

The scheduled completion date is important because the contractor has said it will ship uranium fuel rods to Iran no sooner than six months before the date is set. Work slowed on the plant, on the southern coast of Iran, earlier this year after Russia said Iran was slow in making its monthly payments of $25 million. But Western diplomats said the real reason was a Russian policy decision to support Western pressure on Iran to be more forthright about what Washington said was its covert nuclear program, which could theoretically also threaten Russia. The announcement by Sergei Shmatko, the director of Atomstroyexport, the state-controlled company responsible for the Bushehr plant, shed no light on when or how the financing dispute was resolved. It was also unclear Thursday whether the recent release of a United States intelligence estimate suggesting Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 had any bearing on the decision. The Russian position had always been that evidence was thin that Iran was seeking a nuclear weapon. Mr. Shmatko said the Russians would clarify the schedule for completing the station by the end of this month. A spokeswoman for Atomstroyexport, Irina Esipova, said the clarification would not necessarily include a fixed date of completion, an uncertainty that she attributed to the complexity of startup procedures at a nuclear power plant. Atomstroyexport also said Iran had failed to ensure delivery of parts from third-country contractors. Ms. Esipova said Atomstroyexport and Iran had reached a “single understanding of how to resolve these problems” but declined to elaborate. Over the years, Russia has given various reasons for delays in completing Bushehr and delivering fuel for the startup. An underlying reason suggested by various experts is that completion of the plant would provide justification for Iran to enrich uranium for fuel rods using processes that could also produce highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons.",2007-12-14T06:00:00.000+01:00,NYTIMES,world

The nuclear industry would be wise to do the same. Its actions have done little to foster public confidence in nuclear energy. Since 1986, I have sought to establish an independent safety board to lead investigations of accidents at commercial nuclear power plants regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The proposed board would remove the potential for a conflict of interest when the commission investigates an accident in which it might bear partial responsibility and would provide for more credible regulation of nuclear energy. The Senate approved the independent safety board last year. However, the bill never reached the President's desk, partly because of the opposition of the nuclear industry. It preferred a board that would remain under the control of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, work part time and look only where it is told - in short, a board doomed to ineffectiveness. Nuclear proponents have had 10 years since the accident at Three Mile Island to convince the public that nuclear energy is safe. They have failed miserably. ''The tough part,'' as you note, ''is changing public attitudes.'' But when the industry fights against a change that could help restore that crucial element, there should be no doubt why the nuclear option is not being considered. Environmentalists have put forward a proposal that could create the conditions of public acceptability. But the nuclear industry has failed to join in that effort on any terms but its own. Industry support for a credible independent safety board would be the first step toward regaining the public's trust. It is an important step not only for the future of nuclear energy, but also for public confidence in our nation's 110 operating nuclear reactors. JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

''We want peaceful co-existence but the frequent threats to security forced India to conduct the nuclear tests to silence its enemies and show its strength,'' Mr. Vajpayee told soldiers at a camp near Pokharan, the testing range in the northwestern desert where India conducted five underground nuclear tests last week. The Indian leader's assertive posture followed similar warnings to Pakistan by the Home Minister, Lal Krishna Advani. Today, for the second time in 36 hours, Mr. Advani told Pakistan to ease pressures on India from Pakistani-backed insurgents in the disputed territory of Kashmir, or face what Mr. Advani called ''a pro-active'' response. He did not say what that might be. The statements by India's two most powerful political leaders lent new significance to the nuclear tests. The tests were initially presented as a defensive measure intended to allow India to ward off nuclear threats from Pakistan, which has had a covert nuclear weapons program for 25 years, and from China. But the warnings to Pakistan and the reminders today that India sees itself as a nuclear power seemed aimed at shifting the region's strategic balance in India's favor. The nuclear tests appear increasingly to have been motivated at least in part by the Hindu nationalism that guides the Vajpayee Government. The Indian statements were bound to heighten tensions with Pakistan, which has been weighing pressures from the United States and other nations not to conduct its own nuclear test against domestic political demands to match India. Prime Minister Vajpayee was only 70 miles from Pakistan's border today when he visited the nuclear testing range with a group that included the Defense Minister, George Fernandes, and the top two scientists involved in the tests, Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam and Dr. Rajagopal Chidambaram. The group included Indian reporters, but excluded non-Indian foreign correspondents. Coverage of the visit on Indian television showed Mr. Vajpayee walking around what was identified as the largest of the craters made by the tests, a deep depression in the desert that India's state broadcasting network said was at least 40 feet deep and 1,000 feet across. Mr. Vajpayee, 72, was shown in a baseball cap emblazoned with the code word used for the tests, shakti, a Hindu word meaning power. He addressed troops and officials, calling the tests ''this marvelous achievement that has amazed the world.'' The Prime Minister accused Western nations that have imposed economic sanctions on India, including the United States, of hypocrisy. ''The West argued that while they could have nuclear weapons, we couldn't,'' he said. ''Why? What crime have we committed?'' He added: ''We had to conduct these tests to show our strength after these countries paid no heed to our pleadings that they stop manufacturing nuclear weapons that intimidate others. They continued to build their nuclear arsenal, and they never listened to us. The kind of arsenal they have can destroy this world many times over.''",1998-05-21T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,world
b8ff393a-ced8-4cba-a675-fcba0a9eb42f,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/business/energy-environment/25chinanuke.html,A Radical Kind of Reactor,"SHIDAO, China — While engineers at Japan’s stricken nuclear power plant struggle to keep its uranium fuel rods from melting down, engineers in China are building a radically different type of reactor that some experts say offers a safer nuclear alternative. The technology will be used in two reactors here on a peninsula jutting into the Yellow Sea, where the Chinese government is expected to let construction proceed even as the world debates the wisdom of nuclear power. Rather than using conventional fuel rod assemblies of the sort leaking radiation in Japan, each packed with nearly 400 pounds of uranium, the Chinese reactors will use hundreds of thousands of billiard-ball-size fuel elements, each cloaked in its own protective layer of graphite. The coating moderates the pace of nuclear reactions and is meant to ensure that if the plant had to be shut down in an emergency, the reaction would slowly stop on its own and not lead to a meltdown. The reactors will also be cooled by nonexplosive helium gas instead of depending on a steady source of water — a critical problem with the damaged reactors at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi power plant. And unlike those reactors, the Chinese reactors are designed to gradually dissipate heat on their own, even if coolant is lost. If the new plants here prove viable, China plans to build dozens more of them in coming years. The technology under construction here, known as a pebble-bed reactor, is not new. Germany, South Africa and the United States have all experimented with it, before abandoning it over technical problems or a lack of financing. But as in many other areas of alternative energy, including solar panels and wind turbines, China is now taking the lead in actually building the next-generation technology. The government has paid for all of the research and development costs for the two pebble-bed reactors being built here, and will cover 30 percent of the construction costs. Despite Japan’s crisis, China still plans to build as many as 50 nuclear reactors over the next five years — more than the rest of the world combined. Most of this next wave will be of more conventional designs. But if the pebble-bed approach works as advertised, and proves cost effective, China hopes it can eventually adopt the technology on a broad scale to make nuclear power safer and more feasible as it deals with the world’s fastest growing economy and the material expectations of its 1.3 billion people. Western environmentalists are divided on the safety of pebble-bed nuclear technology. Thomas B. Cochran, the senior scientist on nuclear power for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an American group, said that such reactors would probably be less dangerous than current nuclear plants, and might be better for the environment than coal-fired plants. “Over all, in terms of design,” he said, “it would appear to be safer, with the following caveat: the safety of any nuclear plant is not just a function of the design but also of the safety culture of the plant.” The executives overseeing construction of the new Chinese reactors say that engineers are already being trained to oversee the extensively computerized controls for the plant, using a simulator at a test reactor that has been operating for a decade near Beijing, apparently without mishap. But Greenpeace, the international environmentalist group, opposes pebble-bed nuclear reactors, questioning whether any nuclear technology can be truly safe. Wrapping the uranium fuel in graphite greatly increases the volume of radioactive waste eventually requiring disposal, said Heinz Smital, a Greenpeace nuclear technology specialist in Germany. But he said the waste is far less radioactive per ton than spent uranium fuel rods — one of the big sources of trouble at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. China is building a repository for high-level nuclear waste, like conventional fuel rods, in the country’s arid west. But the far less radioactive spheres, or pebbles, like those from the Shidao reactors will not require such specialized storage; China plans to store the used pebbles initially at the power plants, and later at lower-level radioactive waste disposal sites near the reactors. Whatever fears the rest of the world may have about China’s nuclear ambitions, the environmental cost-benefit analysis contains at least one potential positive: More nukes would let China reduce the heavy reliance on coal and other fossil fuels that now make it the world’s biggest emitter of global-warming gases. “China epitomizes the stark choices that we face globally in moving away from current forms of coal-based electricity,” said Jonathan Sinton, the top China specialist at the International Energy Agency in Paris. “Nuclear is an essential alternative” to coal, he said. “It’s the only one that can provide the same quality of electricity at a similar scale in the medium and long term.” Chinese leaders have been largely unwilling to engage in the global debate on climate change. But they have made a priority of reducing urban air pollution — which kills thousands of people every year and is largely caused by burning coal — and of improving mine safety. Coal mining accidents killed more than 2,400 people in China last year alone. China’s biggest electric company, the state-owned Huaneng Group, now aims to prove that the technology can work on a commercial scale by building the two pebble-bed reactors — each capable of meeting the residential power needs of an American city of 75,000 to 100,000 people. The reactors are expected to go into operation in about four years. The plants’ foundations have already been laid, their steel reinforcing bars pointing skyward, on a desolate landscape dominated by thatch-roofed huts and last season’s cornfields. Chinese safety regulations require that all nuclear plants be located at least 30 miles from the nearest city, in this case Rongcheng, which has a population of one million. It was only three days after a tsunami swamped Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi plant that China’s legislature approved its five-year plan calling for dozens of new nuclear reactors. As the severity of that crisis became evident, Beijing said it would “temporarily suspend“ the approval of new nuclear reactors, but would allow construction to proceed at more than two dozen other nuclear projects already under way. By coincidence, China’s cabinet and its national energy bureau had both given final approval for the pebble-bed reactors here in Shidao in the two weeks before the earthquake, said Xu Yuanhui, the father of China’s pebble-bed nuclear program. China’s nuclear safety agency has met since the Japanese earthquake and reviewed the Shidao’s project plans and site preparation, and has indicated it will be the next project to receive safety clearance. “The conclusion is clear that it is all ready to start to pour concrete,” said Dr. Xu, a former Tsinghua University professor who is now the vice general manager of Chinergy, the contractor building the reactors here. Germany led the initial research into pebble-bed nuclear reactors and built its own research version in the 1960s. That reactor closed after an accident, caused by a jammed fuel pebble that released traces of radiation — coincidentally nine days after the Chernobyl accident in 1986, at a time of greatly increased worry about nuclear safety. Dr. Xu said that China, learning from the German mishap, had designed its reactors to keep the pebbles from jamming. South Africa tried hard until last summer to build a pebble-bed reactor but ran into serious cost overruns. In the United States, the federal government and companies have spent heavily on pebble-bed research. But there has been little appetite for actually building new nuclear reactors — of any sort — since the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. “The Chinese had a determination to build, to show the technology to work, and a commitment to get it done,” said Andrew Kadak, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology nuclear engineer specializing in pebble-bed reactors. “In the U.S. we didn’t have, and still don’t have, the commitment.”",2011-03-25T03:20:45.000+01:00,NYTIMES,business-business-day-energy-&-environment-

Together, Yuichi Kaido and Mizuho Fukushima are perhaps the country’s most prominent pair of antinuclear activists. For three decades, the couple were at the forefront of an often futile fight against the utilities that operated the nation’s reactors, the corporations that built and maintain them and the politicians and bureaucrats who enabled them. Yet in case after case, judges rejected Mr. Kaido’s claims that Japan’s nuclear reactors were dangerous. In Parliament, the nuclear lobby routinely carried the day, casting aside the antinuclear platform of Ms. Fukushima’s Social Democratic Party. That stasis was shattered by the tsunami that wrecked the reactors at the Daiichi power plant in Fukushima. An overwhelming number of Japanese, for years ambivalent about nuclear power, are now calling for the country’s remaining reactors to be shut down. Politicians, even those backed by the nuclear industry, are scrambling to reposition themselves. Once a proponent of building more reactors, Prime Minister Naoto Kan has called for nuclear power to be phased out. In a perverse way, the tragedy represents an opening of sorts for Mr. Kaido and Ms. Fukushima, who applaud the prime minister for backing their cause. Yet after years of frustration and mindful that change comes slowly in Japan, where consensus-building is critical, Mr. Kaido and Ms. Fukushima are far from declaring victory. “I understand that the decision that Prime Minister Kan made carries special importance,” Mr. Kaido said. “The direction is correct, but I wish he would complete the proper process. He should share his ideas with the public.” The rising antinuclear tide in Japan, they said, came at great expense. As a result, they feel humility, not pride. “I thought my life was a failure right after March 11,” Mr. Kaido said, referring to the date of the earthquake and tsunami. “I have devoted myself to legal cases and antinuclear activities to prevent this kind of accident, but I could not prevent the worst from happening. It was an agonizing feeling.” BUT Mr. Kaido and Ms. Fukushima, who were both born in 1955, also take the long view, a necessity for anyone trying to change the way the country’s most powerful companies and lawmakers do business. “Although I won’t be able to change the past, I think I can change the future,” Ms. Fukushima said. “We must change decision-making in politics.” Mr. Kaido and Ms. Fukushima decided long ago to devote themselves to this goal. Both came from comfortable homes and attended top schools that could have provided an entree into more lucrative professions (although according to public records, they had a combined $3.1 million in assets in 2009). But both were growing up during the late 1960s, when Japan’s fledgling environmental movement was taking shape. The events of the times led them to left-wing causes and a lifetime of bucking the establishment. Always drawn to the sciences, Mr. Kaido’s interest in progressive politics grew in 1970, after he entered the law department at the University of Tokyo, a steppingstone for the country’s elite. While there, he joined a study group that focused on public interest issues. Guest speakers included Jinzaburo Takagi, the spiritual leader of Japan’s antinuclear movement. The study group is also where Mr. Kaido met Ms. Fukushima. Though she grew up in Miyazaki, one of the more conservative corners of the country, Ms. Fukushima’s horizons were broader than most — her grandparents emigrated to America and her father was born in Hawaii. As a teenager, Ms. Fukushima learned of the perils of industrial pollution and deadly mercury and cadmium poisoning at the movies, where newsreels were shown before feature films. “The news was a cue for me to become a lawyer,” Ms. Fukushima said. “At that time, I thought Ralph Nader was hip. I admired him as an activist and an attorney.” While their classmates took jobs at bastions like the Ministry of Finance and the nation’s top banks, Mr. Kaido and Ms. Fukushima chose to fight those powers. Mr. Kaido has also represented immigrants, prisoners and, more recently, Greenpeace activists. But it can be a lonely battle, given how smothering big business, big government and the mainstream news media can be. And taking on powerful interests can come at a cost, as Mr. Kaido learned when he was shown on television handing out antinuclear leaflets in front of a train station in Tokyo. His father, an executive at Mitsubishi Electric, which made components used in nuclear power plants, warned him to avoid public protests because it would jeopardize his own career. After the explosion at Three Mile Island, he again told him to stop his protests because the accident would surely force the government to shut the country’s reactors. “I vowed to continue these activities as a lawyer, though I felt sorry to trouble him,” Mr. Kaido said. HE also had a run-in with Ms. Fukushima’s mother, who urged him to register for a marriage certificate. The trouble was that Ms. Fukushima did not want to give up her maiden name and Japan’s civil code demands that spouses share the same last name. So the couple have not married. Their daughter, who is in law school, took Mr. Kaido’s family name. The right to keep one’s name is one of many feminist causes that Ms. Fukushima has championed. She has also pushed passionately for protections against sexual harassment, better care for people with AIDS and greater gender equality. She also became a popular television commentator and won a seat in the upper house of Parliament in 1998. In 2003, she took over leadership of the Social Democratic Party. The party has long opposed nuclear power, and Ms. Fukushima has been particularly outspoken since the nuclear crisis began. She has called for a firewall between the nuclear regulators and the ministry that promotes the industry, and has clashed with Haruki Madarame, the chairman of Japan’s Nuclear Safety Commission, and Masataka Shimizu, the former president of Tokyo Electric Power. “The accident you said will not occur has just occurred,” Ms. Fukushima said to Mr. Madarame in public hearings. “Are you willing to apologize?” Mr. Kaido has to pick his battles more deliberately. In one attempt to shut the troubled Monju fast-breeder reactor, it took him seven years just to be certified to try the case. He won a case involving a reactor in Fukui Prefecture that reportedly had inadequate protections against earthquakes, but that ruling was ultimately overturned. Another high-profile case that aimed to close the aging Hamaoka nuclear power plant in Shizuoka failed in 2007. “The Supreme Court, in order to continue the operation of nuclear plants, can disregard the facts they don’t like or, in some cases, rewrite the facts,” Mr. Kaido said. “They seem to love the nuclear industry that much. Maybe the Supreme Court views the nuclear industry as a state policy, so they have to protect it.” Still, Mr. Kaido said that the events of March 11 had so clearly exposed the dangers of nuclear power that the courts would not be able to ignore his arguments, even if it took years to try cases. “The Supreme Court now realizes they were wrong, so now we have a chance to win,” he said. “There is a hope we can stop these dangerous power plants from now.”",2011-08-20T03:56:43.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-asia-pacific

Credit... Nicole Tung for The New York Times KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian engineers at the country’s largest nuclear power plant are relying on its one active reactor to run the station’s critical safety and cooling systems — a precarious stopgap measure that reflects the desperation of the moment, the head of the Ukrainian energy company said on Thursday. Petro Kotin, the head of the Ukrainian national energy company, Energoatom, said in an interview that while the emergency measure was known to the engineers and outlined in technical documents, it has never been attempted for more than a few hours — and has already gone on for days. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has been using the measure since it was disconnected from external power on Monday, leaving diesel generators as the last fail safe, a risky situation in a war zone where fuel supplies could be compromised. Reconnecting to external power requires spare parts, Mr. Kotin said, and workers are racing to bring them from Ukrainian controlled territory, crossing the front line to reach the Russian-controlled station. Even so, Mr. Kotin said the “degradation” of the facility continued to grow “worse and worse and worse.” A team of inspectors from the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, visited the plant last week and called for the creation of a safe zone around the facility. The team’s leader, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said his biggest concern was the station’s ability to rely on external power. While the reactors themselves are designed to withstand a plane crash, power is needed for essential cooling systems that are much more vulnerable. And since Monday, the plant has been running in what is referred to as island mode, using one “hot” reactor pumping out 140 megawatts of power — less than half its normal generation — to provide energy for essential plant equipment. Mr. Kotin said that the reactor’s technical specifications do not envision this mode being used for more than an hour. Edwin Lyman, a nuclear power expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group in Cambridge, Mass., said the situation was not unprecedented, but was also not standard practice. The I.A.E.A., which sets reactor safety standards for nuclear plants, published a technical document in 2018 that details the backup procedure, also known as “house load operation.” Even plants that have the capability to run in island mode, the I.A.E.A. document noted, may face “a time limit, generally of a few hours.” There are four high-voltage cables running from the plant to the Ukrainian grid and one lower-voltage backup line connected to a nearby fossil-fuel plant. But artillery fire around the plant — Ukraine and Russia each blame the other for the continued shelling — has severed those connections, plus two more lines that run to a small on-site power plant. On Aug. 25, the plant was completely cut off from external power for the first time in its history, briefly plunging it into blackout and forcing the emergency diesel generators to be switched on. Engineers raced to repair the lower-voltage reserve line and reconnected the plant to the grid 14 hours later. On Monday, that reserve line was severed again. Mr. Kotin said engineers made the difficult decision to keep one reactor running to supply power to the plant rather than switching immediately to the generators. “In normal conditions, I would say we should shut down all the reactors,” Mr. Kotin said. Ukrainian officials fear they could be forced to cycle down the plant’s last running reactor anyway, because it was not designed to work this way indefinitely. “The continued deterioration of the situation, the prolonged lack of power supply from an external source of electricity will force us to deploy standby diesel generators,” Oleh Korikov, the chairman of the Ukrainian agency responsible for nuclear and radiation safety, said at a news conference. There are 20 diesel generators at the plant with enough fuel to keep the cooling systems at all six reactors and the spent fuel pools running for 10 days. But they have not been tested to run for more than a day, and keeping them topped off with fuel could be a challenge. “Four huge diesel fuel tanks are needed per day,” Mr. Korikov said. “Potentially, we can find ourselves in a situation with no diesel fuel; it can give rise to an accident.” Mr. Kotin said that was the worst-case scenario. “These are the last defense before you have the melting of the core,” he said. If the station lost all power, he said, a meltdown could begin “within three hours, optimistically.”",2022-09-09T17:16:17.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Opponents of nuclear power plants in Shoreham, L.I., and Seabrook, N.H., have won the backing of a key Congressional leader for legislation that would effectively block operating licenses for the reactors. Representative Morris K. Udall, the Arizona Democrat who heads the House Interior Committee, said today that he would support a measure to prohibit the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from using appropriations from the fiscal years 1988 or 1989 to license either of the plants under relaxed emergency planning standards. Massachusetts officials have refused to cooperate in drawing up evacuation plans for the Seabrook plant, just across the state line in New Hampshire, and New York officials have also boycotted planning to deal with a major accident at the Long Island plant. The nuclear agency has proposed changing its rules so that it could license the two plants without state and local support of the emergency plans, so long as the utilities draft guidelines for evacuating residents within 10 miles. Construction is complete on both plants, which cost more than $4 billion each. ''After speaking with my colleagues who represent the affected areas in New York and Massachusetts, I have agreed to support their amendment to the N.R.C. authorization bill when the bill comes to the floor,'' said Mr. Udall, who had previously resisted attempts to dilute Federal sovereignty over nuclear power. Explaining his decision, Mr. Udall said, ''The amendment is narrowly tailored to apply only to those plants where the state and local officials responsible for emergency planning have determined that no emergency plan would adequately protect the public health and safety.''",1987-07-01T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,u.s.

The nuclear calamity in Japan and Mrs. Merkel’s subsequent reversal on nuclear power played a key role in the elections in the southwest state of Baden-Württemberg, where the Christian Democrats have governed since 1953, before Mrs. Merkel, 56, was born. Most Germans have a deep-seated aversion to nuclear power, and the damage at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan has galvanized opposition. On Saturday, more than 200,000 people took to the streets of four big German cities to protest nuclear power. The news from Japan of soaring radiation levels led the major radio and television newscasts on Sunday. After the catastrophe in Japan, Mrs. Merkel reversed a pro-nuclear policy that she adopted just last year and temporarily shut down seven of Germany’s 17 nuclear plants. She apparently did not convince voters that her change of policy was sincere. At Christian Democrat headquarters in Berlin, there was shock as the preliminary results were announced. “This is very painful for us,” said Annette Schavan, federal education and science minister. At their headquarters across town, the Greens were jubilant over their projected 25 percent of the vote. Winfried Kretschmann, 62, who stands to head a Green-led coalition in Baden-Württemberg, spoke of “a historic change.” According to the preliminary results, the Christian Democrats won the most votes, about 39 percent, down from 44.2 percent in 2006. Yet the weak showing of the Free Democrats, the pro-business party with which Mrs. Merkel governs nationally, left the conservatives no hope of forming the next state government. The Free Democrats looked likely to squeak into the state Legislature with just 5.3 percent of the vote, the minimum required. In 2006, they got 10.7 percent. If the polls are confirmed, the Greens are in a comfortable position to head a coalition with the Social Democrats in Baden-Württemberg, which has some 11 million residents and is among the most prosperous and successful of Germany’s 16 states. The Greens were projected to win 24.2 percent of the vote, compared with 11.7 percent in 2006. The Social Democrats were forecast to take 23.5 percent of the votes, little changed from 2006. “If the results are confirmed, then this is a major breakthrough for the Greens,” said Nils Diederich, a political science professor at the Free University in Berlin. “And it is a huge blow to the chancellor,” he added. “For the Greens, the big question is whether such success can be sustained on the federal level. Its opposition to nuclear energy and its environmental policies really did galvanize its support.” In neighboring Rhineland-Palatinate, where the Social Democrat premier Kurt Beck has governed with an absolute majority since 2006, the Social Democrats suffered sizable losses. Their share of the vote fell to 38 percent on Sunday, from 45.6 percent in 2006. The Green Party, which failed to get elected to the regional parliament in 2006, won 16.8 percent of the vote. Mr. Beck is expected to ask the Greens to join a coalition with the Social Democrats. The Free Democrats were voted out of the regional parliament in Rhineland-Palatinate, and, in a sign that Mrs. Merkel’s party is likely to see as hopeful, the Christian Democrats increased their share of the Rhineland-Palatinate vote to 36 percent from 32.8 percent five years ago. Political analysts credited a good campaign by the regional party leader Julia Klöckner, 38. In Baden-Württemberg, by contrast, the Christian Democrats suffered not only from Mrs. Merkel’s reversal on nuclear power — in a state with four nuclear plants — but also “from a lackluster and unfocused campaign.” The regional party leader and premier, Stefan Mappus, 44, was an unknown local politician until Mrs. Merkel chose him to replace Günther Oettinger, who went to Brussels as European Union commissioner for energy. Last year, Mr. Mappus was slow to react to a groundswell of opposition to Stuttgart 21, a planned new railway station complex in the state capital that was billed as vital to speed up links between Germany and the rest of Europe. The Greens led part of the opposition to the project, gaining a larger profile while Mr. Mappus floundered. But it was the combination of the crisis in Japan, and Mrs. Merkel’s reaction, that swung opinion polls from the conservatives — who three weeks ago looked set to eke out a victory — to the Greens and the Social Democrats. That decision was a U-turn for Mrs. Merkel. Last year she decided to overturn a decision and a relevant law by a former government of Social Democrats and Greens that aimed to close all nuclear power plants by 2022. Mrs. Merkel prolonged the plants’ scheduled lifespan by an average of 12 years. The change did not help Mr. Mappus, who was a staunch defender of nuclear power. He again seemed to flounder, saying at one point that one of the four nuclear plants in his state would be closed permanently. When that did not reverse the drifting polls, he reverted to support of nuclear power. As soon as Mrs. Merkel shifted her stance, the Greens pounced on the change as a move to win votes, and late last week, her economics minister, a Free Democrat, confirmed to a gathering of industry leaders that it was a tactical shift. That reinforced the impression of disarray in the national government.",2011-03-27T23:11:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-europe

The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog plans to visit the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southern Ukraine to assess safety and security this week amid reports of a possible Ukrainian offensive in the south of the country, which could cause an escalation of fighting in the area. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has issued a series of dire warnings about security at the plant, denouncing international complacency and saying that one day luck will run out when it comes to maintaining safety there, given that shelling has already damaged buildings at the plant and cut external power. He continued to issue warnings over the weekend about the threats of allowing fighting anywhere near a nuclear plant, saying in a statement: “The nuclear safety and security dangers are all too obvious, as is the necessity to act now to prevent an accident with potential radiological consequences to the health and the environment for people in Ukraine and beyond.” The facility, the largest nuclear plant in Europe, was seized by Russian troops more than a year ago and is now managed by Russia’s state nuclear company, Rosatom, though many of its operatives and engineers are Ukrainian. All six of its reactors have been shut down, though it requires power to maintain safety. An I.A.E.A. proposal to turn the plant into a demilitarized zone has not borne fruit. Ukrainian officials have said Moscow has rejected the plan on the grounds that it would mean pulling its forces out of the facility, control of which has given them considerable leverage over Ukrainian energy production. Mr. Grossi last visited the plant in September, when he brought the first group of international nuclear inspectors to the plant. Inspectors have been there since then. The plant, which lies on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, is close to the front lines in the conflict. Russian forces control the east bank in the region and have frequently shelled the city of Nikopol and other targets on the western side of the river. Ukraine controls the northern part of the Zaporizhzhia region while Russian forces hold the southern part. In an indication of the frontline tensions, Ukraine’s general staff reported on Monday that Russia had shelled 30 settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region in the previous 24 hours, including Chervone and Charivne. Ukraine’s military leaders have said little about what is expected to be an offensive this spring, during which they will likely make use of tanks and other forms of military aid from the United States and other allies. In the latest example of that support, Britain’s ministry of defense on Monday said that Ukrainian crews have returned home after completing training on how to operate Challenger 2 tanks. Britain has donated 14 of the tanks to Ukraine, though they are not yet with Ukrainian forces. Military analysts cite two possible directions for the counteroffensive, one in the east of the country in the Donbas region and the other in the south. Ukrainian officials have said that a southern offensive would aim to advance on the city of Melitopol in the Zaporizhzhia region. Some military analysts say that could also involve ferrying troops across the Dnipro River southwest of the power plant. Local Ukrainian officials have reported sporadic explosions around Melitopol for months in apparent attacks on Russian forces. There were two more blasts on Monday, the city’s exiled mayor, Ivan Fedorov, said on the Telegram messaging app.",2023-03-27T12:55:54.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

The head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi, told the state-run IRNA news agency on Monday that engineers had found the leak while the reactor was being washed. The delay has forced Iranian officials to push back plans to bring the nuclear facility at Bushehr online, extending the inauguration to early next year. Mr. Salehi denied that the delay had any connection to the Stuxnet computer worm, which has affected more than 30,000 computers across Iran and has been found on some personal computers of staff members at the plant, located in southern Iran near the Persian Gulf. “This issue has nothing to do with the virus,” he said. But even if the malware did not infect control systems at the plant, the delay is yet another setback for a nuclear facility that has been dogged for years by technical problems and foot-dragging by Iran’s Russian partners. The Bushehr nuclear power plant was opened with great fanfare in August in the presence of Iranian and Russian nuclear energy officials and domestic and international media. Officials had originally said that the plant would begin to feed Iran’s electricity grid by November, but last week Iran delayed its operational date to January without giving an explanation. Iranian officials have maintained that the Bushehr plant, Iran’s first nuclear power-generation facility, was unaffected by the Stuxnet worm, which was developed to infiltrate Siemens-designed control systems such as those thought to be installed at Bushehr. On Sunday, a spokesman for Iran’s Ministry of Industries and Mines announced that Iranian industrial units had been completely cleansed of the Stuxnet worm, implying that at least some systems had been affected. Iran has portrayed Stuxnet as part of a “cyberwar” waged by Western nations. On Saturday, Iran’s intelligence minister, Heydar Moslehi, announced the capture of an unspecified number of “nuclear spies” in connection with attempts to spread the Stuxnet worm. The authors of the attack remain unknown, though computer-security experts suspect that it was designed by a government to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program. “All of the destructive activities perpetrated by the oppressors in cyberspace will be discovered quickly and means of combating these plans will be implemented,” Mr. Moslehi said, suggesting that the battle against Stuxnet was not yet over.",2010-10-05T20:25:23.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-world-middle-east

Buffett, the billionaire investor and philanthropist, pledged $50 million on Tuesday to help set up an international nuclear fuel bank that aspiring powers could turn to for reactor fuel instead of making it on their own. Mr. Buffett's aim is to curb the risks of nuclear proliferation by providing an alternative to the kind of indigenous production of nuclear fuel that Iran is embarking upon, and that countries like Argentina, Australia and South Africa have recently announced plans to pursue. Nuclear experts say indigenous production carries with it the risk of military diversion for nuclear arms, and that the risk is rising as a growing number of countries around the world embrace atomic power or plan to expand their nuclear programs. ''This pledge is an investment in a safer world,'' Mr. Buffett said in a statement. ''The concept of a backup fuel reserve has been discussed for many years,'' he said. ''Its creation is inherently a governmental responsibility, but I hope that this pledge of funds will support governments in taking action to get this concept off the ground.'' His pledge came at an international conference here in Vienna where nations are exploring how to create multinational fuel banks as a way to aid nuclear development while avoiding new risks. Multinational banks and plants are seen as having a security advantage because member states can watch one another to prevent weapon diversions. Mr. Buffett's pledge is meant to jump-start the creation of a reserve fuel bank run by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the global nuclear watchdog based in Vienna. He made it through the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a private group in Washington that he advises. Sam Nunn, a former Democratic senator from Georgia and the group's chief executive, announced the $50 million pledge here, calling it a crucial step toward a new order that enhances peaceful aspects of atomic energy. ''We are in a race between cooperation and catastrophe,'' he said, ''and, at this moment, the outcome is unclear.'' Mr. Nunn said a country's decision to import fuel, rather than make it indigenously, could pivot on whether the country can be guaranteed an assured supply. ''We believe that such a mechanism can be achieved,'' he said, ''and that we must take urgent, practical steps to do so.'' Mr. Buffett's pledge is contingent on two years of developments in which the nuclear agency moves to establish the fuel bank and one or more countries contribute an added $100 million or an equivalent amount in reactor fuel. Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the international atomic agency, said Mr. Buffett's pledge ''will provide urgent impetus to our efforts to establish mechanisms for nondiscriminatory, nonpolitical assurances of supply of fuel for nuclear power plants.'' Laura Holgate, a vice president of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, said $150 million in fuel would represent less than 1 percent of that used globally each year, and would be enough to fuel a typical power reactor.",2006-09-20T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,foreign-desk

The most pressing concerns focus on the risk of a meltdown. While they are designed to withstand a range of risk — from a plane crashing into the facility to natural disasters — no operating nuclear power plant has ever been in the middle of active fighting, and this one was not designed with the threat of cruise missiles in mind. There are several main concerns. The concrete shell of the site’s six reactors offer strong protection, as was the case when the No. 1 reactor was struck in March, officials say. More worrying is the chance that a power transformer is hit by shelling, raising the risk of a fire. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of hiding dozens of military vehicles with an unknown amount of munitions on the premises of at least two reactors. If a fire were to break out at the power transformers and the electric network was taken offline, that could cause a breakdown of the plant’s cooling system and lead to a catastrophic meltdown, said Edwin Lyman, a nuclear power expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group in Cambridge, Mass. He noted that the loss of coolant during the Fukushima accident in Japan in 2011 resulted in three reactors undergoing some degree of core meltdown. If the cooling is interrupted, Dr. Lyman said, the nuclear fuel could become hot enough to melt in a matter of hours. Eventually, it could melt through the steel reactor vessel and even the outer containment structure, releasing radioactive material. According to Ukrainian officials, a shell hit a power transformer at the No. 6 reactor at the same time the No. 1 reactor was struck. It did not explode, according to Ukrainian officials.",2022-08-12T19:55:35.000+02:00,NYTIMES,timeswire

Translated by Evelyn Rossiter. Foreword by Andrei Sakharov. 274 pp. New York: Basic Books. $22.95. In ""The Truth About Chernobyl,"" Grigory Medvedev has written a slender classic in the history of nuclear power, one that is shocking in its revelations, gripping in its drama and chilling in its implications. It is difficult to imagine that a more absorbing account of the explosion of the nuclear power facility at Chernobyl in the early hours of April 26, 1986, will ever be written. Mr. Medvedev reconstructs the events of that day and the next in great detail; he devotes 40 pages to the last 20 seconds before the explosion. He describes the location and the behavior of every person in the control room and the reactor building. He knew many of these people personally, and he relates not just what they did or did not do, but their doubts and fears as the monster they were supposed to control failed to respond to their commands, and their panic as it began to rock in a wild dance culminating in a series of violent explosions that destroyed a nuclear reactor and spewed a lethally radioactive cloud for miles around the plant. Mr. Medvedev knows his subject well. He was chief engineer at Chernobyl at the time of its construction in 1970; at the time of the 1986 explosion, he was in Moscow as deputy director of the department of the Soviet Ministry of Energy that was in charge of nuclear power plant construction. A few days after the disaster he was assigned the task of heading an official investigation of its causes. He went to Chernobyl, interviewed the control room supervisors before they died of radiation and toured the entire facility. Near the wrecked reactor he carried a radiometer in his hand and walked more rapidly whenever the needle moved high on its scale. At one point it indicated he was absorbing radiation for less than a minute at a rate of 500 roentgens an hour (the maximum permissible dose for nuclear power plant operators is 5 roentgens a year). Within a few days he began writing up his report, of which this book -- published in 1989 in the Soviet Union and now translated by Evelyn Rossiter -- is the final form. The very appearance of the report in public forums, there and here, is a sign of what glasnost means. The design, overall administration and day-to-day operation of the Chernobyl plant, as Mr. Medvedev describes them, were so incredibly negligent that one wonders why the disaster did not occur earlier. The list of violations of both common sense and official regulations is so extensive that it is hardly an exaggeration to say safety precautions were nonexistent. The design of the reactor made it inherently unstable, since at certain moments its power-generating capacity exceeded the ability of the graphite control rods to slow the reaction. (Nuclear engineers call this excess capacity a ""positive reactivity coefficient."") Both the senior administrators of the Soviet nuclear power program and the local operating staff were inadequately trained. An experiment designed to test energy output while shutting down the reactor, which led directly to the disaster, was ineptly planned and executed. The plant operators shut off the emergency cooling system, a final line of defense against catastrophe, before the experiment began. Even after the explosion occurred, the mountain of errors grew. The director of the plant refused to admit the reactor had been destroyed even after seeing scattered on the ground pieces of graphite that could only have come from inside the reactor. Authorities in Moscow, fearing panic, prohibited a timely evacuation of the surrounding population. At first, plant personnel did not even have simple radiometers and dosimeters to measure the radiation levels, since they were locked in a safe that was buried under a pile of rubble by the explosion. Potassium iodide tablets, which help fend off the effects of radiation, were not available at the local medical center. During the day following the disaster, in the nearby city of Pripyat, where intense levels of radiation could easily have been measured, children were permitted to go to school and outdoor sporting events were held on schedule. Even 16 weddings were performed. On April 27, a day and a half after the explosion, the people in Pripyat and nearby villages were told they would be picked up by city buses and taken away for a few days. Some of them heard warnings to stay indoors, but few people did. They waited in lines for the buses, their children playing in the streets and picking up radioactive dust on their shoes. Told to leave their possessions behind, the residents departed in light clothing and with only small suitcases. Their abandoned pets in the city and the farm animals in the country soon took over the deserted streets and roads; after a few days they began devouring one another in a radioactive frenzy. Eventually soldiers and hunters were sent in by helicopter to shoot the packs of dogs roaming the streets of Pripyat. Those streets have remained vacant to this day, patrolled occasionally by guards whose exposure to radioactivity is, at last, carefully monitored. Several hundred square miles of territory will remain closed for many years. Already scientists are describing unusual mutations among the flora there and in fauna coming from this forbidden zone, including butterflies with malformed antennae. In Mr. Medvedev's indictment of incompetence, delusion and arrogance the only inspiring element is the heroism of the men and women who fought to overcome the calamity. Firefighters, electricians, turbine engineers, physicians and nurses rushed to the scene without protective gear and sacrificed themselves to a radiation so intense that in some cases they returned from their posts turned brown with what Mr. Medvedev calls ""nuclear tan,"" and incapable of further action. Helicopter pilots fell ill while dumping tons of sand on the open incandescent reactor core. Scuba divers swam to certain death in the pool of water under the reactor to close valves and prevent even greater damage. What does Chernobyl mean for the rest of the world, for the future of nuclear power? Mr. Medvedev's book, sobering and important as it is, relates a story of such incompetence and stupidity at Chernobyl that the proponents of nuclear power in other countries can easily maintain that their plants do not possess the same vulnerabilities. They will note that reactors of the type built at Chernobyl were never widely used outside the Soviet Union, and that they are rapidly being shut down even in that country. They will point with pride to their training programs and management policies, undoubtedly superior to those at Chernobyl. They will maintain that Chernobyl was a tragic aberration in the history of nuclear power. Immersed in the details of the Chernobyl calamity, Mr. Medvedev is not able to address these predictable reactions to his book. He does not venture a general analysis of the future of nuclear power. Yet it is clear he has deep doubts that it can ever be made safe. He speaks of the ""complexity and dangers of the work done by people in the nuclear power industry"" and observes that ""accidents began to occur in nuclear reactors virtually as soon as they started operations."" He lists 12 nuclear accidents that have occurred in the United States and 11 in the Soviet Union, and calls them ""precursors of the disaster."" It falls to Andrei Sakharov, the developer of the Soviet Union's hydrogen bomb, in a foreword written just months before his death, to anticipate the experts' opinion that the Chernobyl event does not bear on the viability of nuclear power in other countries. He observes: ""These issues are so crucial that they cannot be left to technical experts, and still less to bureaucrats, whose approach is too narrowly technical, too tendentious and sometimes prejudiced, as it is paralyzed by a network of mutual solidarity."" The technical characteristics of Soviet nuclear reactors may be different from those in other countries, but the strengths and limitations of experts' advice are surprisingly similar everywhere. Trained to penetrate complex issues, scientists and engineers have great difficulty saying ""I don't know"" in answer to a technical question. Despite the fact that such an answer is appropriate at this moment to the query, ""Does nuclear power offer a permanent and safe source for our energy needs?"" few experts are willing to enunciate the humbling words. More often they will say the problem lies with a public that fails to understand that no energy source is without risk, or they will speak of ""human error"" involved in the operation of nuclear power plants, as if technology were entirely separate from the people who design and employ it. Rarely do they recognize that at least parts of the problem can be found in the extremely dangerous technology itself and in the blinkered mentality of the scientific and technical establishment directly responsible for the development and use of nuclear power. 'I HAD ENOUGH RADIATION' MOSCOW -- For Grigory Ustinov Medvedev, writing ""The Truth About Chernobyl"" was a moral necessity and the last act in a long and dangerous career as a nuclear engineer. ""I felt I had to help people penetrate the secrets surrounding the Chernobyl catastrophe and its victims, and aim for the maximum possible aid,"" Mr. Medvedev said in a recent interview here. Until his book came out, he said, people were still ignorant of many of the consequences of the nuclear accident at the Chernobyl reactor in 1986. ""Until then, everything was secret, hidden. People were still living in the contaminated area, convinced that nothing terrible could happen to them,"" he recalled. ""The Truth About Chernobyl"" was first published in the Soviet Union in June 1989. Judging by the thousands of enthusiastic letters he received and positive reviews, the book was an immediate success. ""Admittedly,"" Mr. Medvedev allowed, ""since I criticized some of my superiors in my book, I received a number of abusive phone calls. This, of course, did not get into the press."" Generally speaking, Mr. Medvedev views Government initiatives -- Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's in particular -- to cope with the tragic Chernobyl legacy as adequate. ""In the first three years, about 20 billion rubles were collected,"" said Mr. Medvedev. ""This year alone, about 10 billion rubles have been allocated for the resettlement, aid and medical treatment of Chernobyl victims. And as Gorbachev said, this money will keep on flowing into a special account."" Mr. Medvedev was last in Chernobyl in 1987. Today, he is no longer actively involved in nuclear engineering. ""I had enough!"" he said. ""I worked as a nuclear engineer for 30 years or even more. I got enough radiation. I was hospitalized before and after Chernobyl. But then I was a rather young man and I recovered well. Now I indulge in literary work. I'm a member of the Writers' Union and I write books. Enough is enough."" -- ALEXA SCANZIANNI 10 HIROSHIMA BOMBS In order to understand the quantity of radioactive substances ejected by the explosion . . . a sort of flattened sphere of high energy emission some 23 feet (7 m) across and 10 feet (3 m) high had been formed. . . . And it was that same part of the core that was blasted high into the atmosphere . . . and borne by the wind in a northwesterly direction, across Byelorussia and the Baltic republics and beyond the boundaries of the Soviet Union. . . . In this way, about 50 tons of nuclear fuel evaporated and were released by the explosion into the atmosphere as finely dispersed particles of uranium dioxide, highly radioactive radionuclides of iodine-131, plutonium-239, neptunium-139, cesium-137, strontium-90, and many other radioactive isotopes. . . . In addition, about 70 tons were ejected sideways from the periphery of the core, mingling with a pile of structural debris, onto . . . the grounds of the plant. . . . I must emphasize that the radioactivity of the ejected fuel reached 15,000-20,000 roentgens per hour. . . . Some 50 tons of nuclear fuel and 800 tons of reactor graphite . . . remained in the reactor vault, where it formed a pit reminiscent of a volcanic crater. . . . To grasp the true magnitude of the radioactive release, one should merely remember that the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima weighed almost 4.5 tons. . . . However, the reactor of No. 4 unit at Chernobyl spewed into the atmosphere almost 50 tons of evaporated fuel . . . in other words, ten Hiroshima bombs, without the initial blast and firestorm effects, plus almost 70 tons of fuel and some 700 tons of radioactive reactor graphite which settled in the vicinity of the damaged unit. -- From ""The Truth About Chernobyl.""",1991-04-07T02:00:00.000+02:00,NYTIMES,arts books
