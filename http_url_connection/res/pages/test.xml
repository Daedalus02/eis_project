Photograph: Matthew Chattle/Rex/Shutterstock A Together Against Antisemitism rally in London. Photograph: Matthew Chattle/Rex/Shutterstock Antisemitism Letters Antisemitic cartoon was appalling and avoidable Readers respond to the Guardian’s publication of a cartoon that contained racist tropes, which was later withdrawn with an apology Thu 4 May 2023 17.51 BSTLast modified on Thu 4 May 2023 20.10 BST It seems that, far too often, Jews need to point out obvious examples of egregious racism directed at them. The fact that we need to do this in supposedly liberal, anti-racist spaces makes it all the more appalling. Martin Rowson’s cartoon (Journal, 29 April), which he has fully apologised for, contained trope after trope – Jews with grotesque features, money, power and puppeteering. We are tired of calling this out. We will never really know what led Rowson to draw this cartoon. Neither will we know the precise process that led to its publication. However, in the meantime, the Jewish community is left in despair as to why, despite all the history, we still need to expose and fight anti-Jewish racism. Keith Black Chair, Jewish Leadership Council We were astonished that the Guardian saw fit to print Martin Rowson’s grotesque cartoon marking the resignation of Richard Sharp as chair of the BBC. You may have withdrawn it from the Guardian’s online edition, but it is very sad that you saw fit to print such antisemitic stereotypes in the first place. The imagery shown in the cartoon derives directly from the crude propaganda of the Nazis – the grotesquely exaggerated features, what appears to be piles of money and other symbols of wealth, and the squid, which seems to be a clear reference to the trope of tentacles of Jews allegedly trying to take over the world. The Guardian is a newspaper that claims to have progressive values, and is read by people who broadly do have such values, for the most part. We hope you would think twice before publishing something so diametrically opposed to those values again. Adele Douglas and Barnaby Marder Socialists Against Antisemitism When I first saw the cartoon, I saw what Martin Rowson thought he was depicting – Boris Johnson’s toxicity and how it destroys everyone who comes into close contact with him. When I then read about the horrified response from others, I went back to the cartoon, and there, indeed, was the evidence of antisemitic iconography that I had missed the first time. The evidence was ambiguous but also undeniable. It made me think of Rorschach inkblot tests, which reveal unconscious interpretations of random shapes. These interpretations are clues to the inner world of the interpreter. I think both Rowson and I need to work harder to see what is in front of us, and to hope that we can learn from this. Andrew Collie Maidstone, Kent It was so depressing to see coverage of your cartoon on Richard Sharp’s resignation. It simply should not have escaped Martin Rowson and the editors’ notice that its overtones were antisemitic. As a British Jew, and Guardian reader, I find this all too predictable. Both the cartoon (for which you should have known better) and the resulting outcry (which you can’t help, but again, should have expected). It does no one, apart from voluble fringe characters, any good. This was a completely avoidable misstep. I can’t be the only one who is heartily sick of these “how antisemitic is the left” debates. Do please stop adding fuel to the fire. Name and address supplied I think it would be a good idea if Martin Rowson and staff at the Guardian watched the documentary Jews Don’t Count and read David Baddiel’s book of the same name on which it is based, and really take to heart what is being said. I think the publication of the awful antisemitic cartoon is a prime example of what Baddiel is talking about. Carol Taylor Birmingham Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Truss, Trump … when politics is this crazy, only cartoons can do it justice This article is more than 6 months old Martin Rowson An exhibition of how cartoonists covered the Johnson era shows the power of our genre in holding leaders to account Sat 22 Oct 2022 09.00 BSTLast modified on Sat 22 Oct 2022 19.52 BST The Cartoon Museum’s new show of Boris Johnson cartoons, This Exhibition Is A Work Event, chronicles Johnson’s time as prime minister through the work of 50 different cartoonists (including a lot of regular Guardian contributors). But there is a question that, even now – as Liz Truss self-detonates and Tory members talk about the possibility of bringing him back – we must ask: were any of us actually delivering the coup de grace to Britain’s Worst Ever Prime Minister (Up Until Then) by caricaturing his defining ridiculousness? Or did we merely frantically scramble to keep pace with the madness his premiership added in spades to the preexisting madness of the past six – or arguably 14, or even 5,000 – years? Many US cartoonists faced the same dilemma with Donald Trump. You couldn’t, as many of them have told me, make this shit up. What are you meant to do when the targets of your satire are the masters of their own absurdity? I once described Trump and Johnson to an American audience as two cheeks of the same arse (and then took another 10 minutes explaining what I meant), because both successfully controlled the laughter agenda, more or less from the beginning. And I mean from when they could first walk and fall over for comedy effect. Trump and Johnson are both sociopathic narcissists who feed, like vampires, on our horrified attention, using arsing about like any class clown. But herein also lies their achilles heel. Almost their whole purpose in life is to get us to laugh with and not at them. To give him his due, Trump can crack fairly effective, if brutal, jokes, whereas Johnson is merely a Tory or newspaper editor’s idea of funny and lands punchlines like the Hindenburg. Nonetheless, he has always understood the importance of the arsing about, hence the whole contrived “Boris” act. Twenty years ago, commissioned to produce a Spectator cover when Johnson was editor, and increasingly enraged by his failure to confirm the precise specs I needed, I phoned him and got the usual Johnsonian harrumphing noises. I told him, maybe intemperately, for once in his life to drop the PG Wodehouse bollocks, to which he replied: “What you call the PG Wodehouse bollocks has served me very well thus far.” And yet a couple of years later, when he was by then London mayor and was leaving a party at the Spectator’s offices, I encountered him standing on the pavement. “What’s it like having responsibility finally thrust on your shoulders, eh, Boris?” I quipped, and his reply this time was abject. “All these awful people like you keep doing these terrible drawings of me,” he whined, pouting. Part of the car crash of Johnson’s personality is that he’s a terrible liar. Not just like that, but because you can see in his face the precise truth as to his mood at any time. On this occasion he wasn’t joking, he was whingeing, seemingly incapable of understanding why everyone everywhere wasn’t laughing gratefully at his hilarious antics. Similarly, seven years later he was due to open an exhibition of cartoons I’d drawn about London politics over a decade and a half. He pulled out of the event an hour before we opened, clearly unable to cope in real time, with TV cameras present, with the prospect of me pointing to a cartoon of him caricatured as a fatberg and be expected to take the joke in good part. Ultimately, Johnson’s fall was like Nicolae Ceaușescu’s in reverse. The Romanian politburo knew the boss’s days were numbered when the crowd at a rally started to laugh at him. We knew “Boris” was stuffed when, at the final PMQs before his defenestration, the Tory benches stopped laughing. He’d finally completely lost control of the laughter agenda. Which, thank God, means it’s back where it belongs, with the cartoonists. Martin Rowson Boris Johnson’s resignation as Tory leader I drew this when Johnson resigned to capture his defining entitled delusion. After his own side forced him out he carries on (as his Eton housemaster wrote of him) as if rules for everybody else don’t apply to him. But behind the blustering bonhomie there remained a sullen, petulant, pouting manbaby, refusing to believe we’d all stopped applauding with joyous gratitude because he’s so lovely. Various visions of “Boris” – Trump the populist, Churchill the heroic war leader and Pericles the great orator – buoy up an unpopular coward barely able to string together a coherent sentence. Them’s the breaks. Rebecca Hendin Whitehall’s revolving door This cartoon was made on one of those beautiful days in the halcyon year of 2021 in which the endless stream of Boris sleaze coalesced with the endless stream of general Tory sleaze. In this case, the be-sleazed was David Cameron, who was at the time under fire for using his position of influence to lobby on behalf of causes close to his heart* (*wallet). Given the cyclical nature of sleaze among the party, a revolving door being used by the two PMs seemed apt: Boris coming and Cameron going, as fit the news that day. But let’s be honest: on a different day it could have been Boris with another Tory from the recent crop, or yet another Tory with another. All hail the Tory sleaze cycle! Terrible for the country, but – far more importantly – easy fodder for cartoonists. Steve Bell Boris Johnson’s coronavirus ‘battle plan’ This was drawn at a time when the Covid-19 outbreak was very much in the news, but a couple of weeks before lockdown was actually declared. A photograph had appeared of Boris Johnson in a bright yellow coat bearing the logo of Public Health England, the first I had ever heard of such an organisation. This drawing apes the design of the cover of the 2019 Conservative party election manifesto showing Johnson giving the thumbs up beneath the slogan: “Get Brexit Done Release Britain’s Potential” It was a simple step to replace this with an equivalent punchy slogan summing up what seemed to be the government’s then (and subsequent) policy on Covid, public health and public services in general. Ben Jennings Boris Johnson drawing a line under things This cartoon was produced when Boris Johnson was desperate to draw a line under the Partygate scandal that had plagued his government ever since revelations began to emerge that Downing Street had essentially become the only nightclub during the pandemic to stay in business. This was at a time when people were saying goodbye to dying loved ones on iPads or being told off by the police for sitting in parks due to the laws his government had enacted. It wasn’t the issue that finished him in the end, but it had given him a mighty hangover that he could never quite shake off, and left his leadership mortally wounded. Here we have him literally drawing that line in the sand, which is then revealed to be the sand within an hour glass where Boris is trapped as his time at the top fizzles away. This turned out to be quite accurate in the end as one month after the cartoon was published, he was gone. My depiction of Johnson developed over the years as I continued to simplify the character into what eventually finished with the version we have here of a vision-impairing blond mop complete with big gob and a permanent, protruding Pinocchio nose that was a useful recurring prop in many cartoons. Henny Beaumont Partying at No 10 while others suffered During lockdown my whole family had to shield my daughter, who has Down’s syndrome and was vulnerable. Like so many other families we made considerable sacrifices; my husband’s mother died without him able to visit her, my adult daughters were unable to work, let alone party, my teenage son missed out on two years of seeing friends, of normal socialising. My fury at Boris was off the scale after hearing about his parties and Matt Hancock’s pathetic behaviour (you can glimpse him in the right hand corner of the cartoon). A lot of Boris cartoons exaggerate Boris’s dumb bumbling affectation. I wanted to show his culpability and put a knowing evil glint in his eyes. Nicola Jennings Boris Johnson’s food strategy for England This cartoon was drawn the day the government released a white paper on its new food strategy that contained little to address the soaring cost of food and cost of living, and also backtracked on Boris Johnson’s pet anti-obesity programme. “Let them eat birthday cake” alludes to Marie Antoinette’s famous indifference to the plight of the poor which the new strategy reflected, and simultaneously to the Partygate scandals when Boris was “ambushed” by his own birthday cake. It also echoes his cakeism fantasy that Brexit would let Britain have its cake and eat it. * This Exhibition is a WORK EVENT! runs until Sunday, April 16, the Cartoon Museum, 63 Wells St, London W1W 8HJU Topics Boris Johnson Opinion Liz Truss Donald Trump Conservatives comment Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed The Guardian view Columnists Cartoons Opinion videos Letters News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email Help Complaints &amp; corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms &amp; conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Twitter Newsletters Advertise with us Search UK jobs Back to top © 2023 Guardian News &amp; Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The man, a legal officer known by the nickname Tonmai, was arrested on 31 December 2020 after police raided his home and confiscated desk calendars that included images of yellow ducks – one of the symbols of youth-led pro-democracy protests that began more than two years ago. Officials said the calendars, which were being sold through a Facebook protest group, defamed the king. Tonmai was sentenced to three years but, when his testimony was taken into account, the court reduced the sentence to two years. He has appealed against the verdict and posted more than 70,000 baht (£1,680) for bail. At least 1,890 people, including 284 young people under 18, have been charged under various laws after authorities cracked down on youth-led mass protests that began in July 2020. Among those charged, at least 228 people face cases under Thailand’s lese-majesty law, breaches of which carry sentences of between three and 15 years. Individuals, mostly young people, have been targeted for political speeches and online posts, as well as for more satirical forms of protests such as wearing fancy dress. During Tonmai’s case, it was alleged that several pages of the calendar were intended to mock the king. This included images of a cartoon duck pictured alongside dogs, a duck flying a VIP plane while two other ducks walked alongside, and of a duck with a condom on its head. The dogs were intended to mock people loyal to the royal family, and the image of the plane was intended to relate to the king, queen and consort, a prosecution witness alleged. The defence argued that Tonmai had not produced the calendars, and only helped to deliver them. The duck was not an impersonation of the king, but its own character, the defence said. Rubber ducks became an unlikely symbol of the 2020 pro-democracy movement after some protesters used inflatable ducks as a shield against water cannon. Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement that the case “sends a message to all Thais, and to the rest of the world, that Thailand is moving further away from – not closer to – becoming a rights-respecting democracy”. The protests that gathered pace in 2020 rocked Thailand by calling for political change, including reforms to the country’s powerful monarchy – a taboo subject that had not previously been addressed in public. The mass protests dwindled the following year, partly because of a legal clampdown. However, calls for change persist in other forms. Two women, Tantawan Tuatulanon, known as Tawan, 21, and Orrawan Phoopong, known as Bam, 23, have been on hunger strike since 18 January to call for legal reform. Both face lese-majesty charges and, despite being granted bail, are calling for the release of others facing various charges, who are being held in pre-trial detention.
