    <head>Non, minister. Spare us the derriere sex scenes and stick to politics</head>
    <body>Sex in novels is frequently terrible and occasionally so excruciating as to verge on the actionable; indeed, a legal precedent that would penalise writers for scorching their readers’ retinas with the sheer heat of embarrassment might function as a useful deterrent. Literature needs all the fans it can get; protect us from the throbbing gristle and heaving mammaries of a thousand overheated imaginations. Institute a particular ban on the word moist, and freedom of speech be damned. Alas, it would be too late to curb the creative enthusiasms of Bruno Le Maire, the French economy minister whose most recent novel, Fugue Américaine, has erm, risen to prominence courtesy of a dilated anus. Protect your eyes and do not enquire further. Naturally, much of the truly gripping stuff is going on beyond the page. Le Maire stands accused of fiddling while Paris burns, amusing himself on his typewriter as France’s citizens stand on the barricades protecting their pension rights and railing against the callousness of the Macron administration. This feels harsh: everyone has a right to a life outside work and writing about an anus seems small beer compared with eating one on national television in a celebrity game show, or hosting frothing rightwing debates, were one, say, to be a sitting member of parliament. Le Maire has form in literary circles, not merely as an author – this is not his first rodeo – but as an actual character; he is the inspiration, if that is le mot juste, for the character of politician Bruno Juge in Michel Houellebecq’s most recent novel, Anéantir (Annihilate), a typically lighthearted romp through woes both contemporary and timeless: mortality, the death of love, violence, alienation, that sort of thing. Le Maire and Houellebecq are pals, whose intimate soirées to parse passages of Balzac were written in the stars when the politician helped the writer in the tricky bureaucratic matter of repatriating his beloved corgi Clément’s remains from Ireland to France over a decade ago. (So attached was Houellebecq to Clément that he exhibited a series of photographs and watercolours of him at Paris’s Palais de Tokyo a few years ago, accompanied by the deceased dog’s toys and a monologue by Iggy Pop. And they say the English are mad about their dogs.) But back to sex. It rarely thrives out of context, whether in prose or actual life, and we should salute Le Maire for having a go; he is, at least, interested in books, rather than being a mere dilettante cashing in on his public profile. Politicians, as we know, have far less edifying passions, and the gatekeepers who would create a special category of “proper” writers should remember that for every Dorries there is a Disraeli. We must not be cowed by the memory of Boris Johnson’s sub-Wodehousian foray into fiction, Seventy-Two Virgins, though it is to be devoutly hoped he never attempts it again. Meanwhile, in life as in literature, there is always a subtext. Le Maire, who has previously clashed with Macron, is touted as a possible contender in the French presidential elections of 2027, in which the incumbent cannot stand for a third term. It’s a little early for his rivals to get going, but if the electorate remembers a dilated anus before it remembers Le Maire’s political record, then tant pis. • Alex Clark writes for the Guardian and the Observer Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    <head>Michel Houellebecq sex film to be released despite attempt to stop it</head>
    <body>A Dutch art collective can release an experimental erotic film showing the French novelist Michel Houellebecq having sex with young women in spite of the author’s attempt to stop its circulation, an Amsterdam court has ruled. Amsterdam’s district court on Tuesday afternoon dismissed a legal complaint by Houellebecq and his wife, Qianyun Lysis, that had aimed to curb the distribution of the film KIRAC 27 by Keeping It Real Art Critics, as well as a trailer that was uploaded on the art collective’s website last month but has since been taken down. The clip shows the 67-year-old enfant terrible of French letters in pyjamas lying on a bed next to a woman in a nightie, smoking and laughing. “I told him that I knew many girls in Amsterdam who would sleep with the famous writer out of curiosity,” a voiceover says. According to the court’s verdict, the idea to have the author of Submission and Atomised star in an experimental porn film to “counteract his gloom” had first been proposed to KIRAC’s co-director Stefan Ruitenbeek by Houellebecq’s wife at a dinner in Paris in autumn 2022. Via email, Houellebecq and Ruitenbeek subsequently discussed plans to make “a work of art, in which the distinction between fiction and reality takes shape as a game with the rancorous paranoia of your enemies”. Upon arriving in Amsterdam for filming on 1 December 2022, the writer signed a release form, agreeing to appear in a film that “may or may not include explicit content”. The agreement’s only restriction was that the film would not show Houellebecq and his genitals in the same shot. Summarising the original plan for the film, the court said the split between images of faces and genitalia “would leave the viewer in wonder as to whether Houellebecq actually participated in the sex scenes, or whether a stand-in in them was acting for him”. However, on 23 December, three days before the scheduled end of the shoot, Houellebecq walked out on the project. In a letter published on his personal website, the writer said his and the Dutch director’s “conceptions of artistic work were radically opposed”, likening it to “gutter journalism”. In his complaint to the Amsterdam court, Houellebecq argued that he was struggling with severe depression at the time of signing the agreement and had drunk several glasses of wine. The court dismissed his objection for lack of a doctor’s certificate proving Houellebecq’s condition, and questioned whether wine had been drunk before rather than after the signing of the agreement. If the intended ambiguity of the art film had narrowed, the verdict concludes, “it is at least as much the result of Houellebecq’s attempts to prevent disclosure of the footage”. Earlier this month another court in Paris rejected a complaint in which Houellebecq had argued the film’s trailer damaged his private life and honour, as well as spreading lies about his wife. The film’s planned premiere on 11 March was nonetheless postponed due to the two lawsuits. The legal row has pitted one of the most flamboyant polemicists of the European literary world against a Dutch group with a similar taste for courting controversy. Under the KIRAC guise, artists Stefan Ruitenbeek, Kate Sinha and Tarik Sadouma have since 2016 released short films on YouTube that explore and make fun of the international art world, often mingling factual and fictional elements in ways that are hard to keep apart. In interviews, Houellebecq has repeatedly defended the principle of women being paid to have sex, heavily criticising his home country for making prostitution illegal in 2016. In his 2001 novel Platform, a semi-autobiographical protagonist called Michel wanders around Thailand as a sex tourist. While legal action had delayed the editing of KIRAC 27, Ruitenbeek said he expected a final cut of the film, including the disagreement with its star performer, to be released in May. “It has always been my intention to make an artwork with integrity”, Ruitenbeek said in a statement. “Hopefully Michel is happy with the result.”</body>

    <head>Trump boasted he had ‘intelligence’ on Macron’s sex life</head>
    <body>Donald Trump boasted to close associates that he knew secrets about Emmanuel Macron’s sex life from US intelligence sources, it has been reported. The report in Rolling Stone magazine comes in the wake of the release of court documents on the classified and national defence documents found in a search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home on 8 August, which mention a file referred to as “info re: President of France”. It is unclear whether the file on Macron was classified or what it contained. But Rolling Stone claimed that its mention in the official inventory of what was seized at Mar-a-Lago caused a “transatlantic freakout” between Paris and Washington. A French embassy spokesperson said: “We do not comment on legal proceedings in the US and … the embassy has not asked the administration for any information concerning the documents retrieved at former President Trump’s residence.” Neither the state department nor Trump’s office have so far responded to a request for comment. The Rolling Stone report said that during and after his presidency, Trump claimed to some of his closest associates that he knew details of Macron’s private life, which he had gleaned from “intelligence” he had seen or been briefed on. Macron initially courted Trump, inviting him to the Bastille Day military parade in 2017 just two months after he was elected, inspiring the US president to badger his own generals to stage a similar show of military pageantry in Washington. Relations soon soured between the two leaders, particularly after Macron’s failure to persuade Trump to stay in the nuclear deal with Iran. Trump took the US out of the deal in 2018, and it has unravelled since then. They also fell out over Trump’s abrupt order to pull troops out of northern Syria and his distrust of Nato. In December 2019, Trump called Macron “a pain in the ass” while addressing a group of ambassadors to the UN.</body>

    <head>French minister’s steamy novel turns up heat on Macron</head>
    <body>An explicit sex scene in a newly published novel by the French economy minister has left the government facing fresh accusations it is not listening to the concerns of the country just as it tries to contain anger over the unpopular rise in the pension age. The toe-curling sexual descriptions in the novel, Fugue Américaine, written by the economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, have angered opposition politicians and inspired anti-government slogans and graffiti at street demonstrations as the government struggles to contain the political crisis over Emmanuel Macron raising the minimum pension age to 64. The novel was published hours before the credit ratings agency Fitch downgraded the country’s debt worthiness last week, feeding accusations from leftwingers that writing the novel had taken Le Maire’s focus off the economy and inflation. The minister’s book is a fictionalised account of the pianist Vladimir Horowitz, told through the story of two brothers who travel to Cuba to attend one of his concerts. But it was a sex scene in chapter 11 that has gone viral and prompted French satirists and protesters to ridicule Le Maire. The public broadcaster France Info said that the sex scene, involving a character called Julia, had been greeted with “mockery and stupefaction”, while the French edition of the Huffington Post headlined its story “Bruno Le Maire has written about an anus and no one was ready for this.” Julia’s declaration, “I’ve never been this dilated”, sparked ridicule and became the topic of anti-government signs and graffiti at May day demonstrations across France. The satirist and comedian Sophia Aram read out the sex scene on France’s most popular radio station to a soundtrack of Spandau Ballet music amid jokes about the economy on its knees. Olivier Varlan, a historian, joked on Twitter that the government should put in place a psychological hotline for people who had stumbled upon the chapter by accident. The award-winning French novelist Nicolas Mathieu, although accepting that any sex scene taken out of context would look ridiculous, offered his own re-writing of the scene. “At a time when the French people have huge worries about inflation … should he have one minute, one hour, one week of his time to dedicate to writing erotic scenes?” asked the MP François Ruffin of the radical left party, La France Insoumise. Thomas Portes, of the same party, tweeted: “Inflation is exploding, millions of people can’t eat or fill their fridge, pay their rent. France is fighting the pension reform. And during this time, the minister Bruno Le Maire writes novels. Right to the end, they’re throwing disdain in our face.” Le Maire’s colleague, the labour minister, Olivier Dussopt, admitted he had not read the novel but defended the minister’s right to write it. “This shows that there are feelings … behind the suits of the ministers,” he told BFMTV, adding that he had read the sex scene and it “made him smile”. Le Maire, faced with astonishment that he could do a round of media interviews plugging an explicit novel when French people were struggling to make ends meet, hastily explained that writing was his hobby. “Many of you are asking me how I find the time to write when I’m a minister,” he wrote on social media, explaining that it was his way of finding “personal balance” in life. “Some people do gardening or go hiking, I write,” he said, later explaining on French TV that he wrote in the holidays, at weekends and after getting up at 5am. Le Maire, who was formerly in the rightwing party of Nicolas Sarkozy and has been economy minister since Macron took office in 2017, has published five books during his time running the French economy. In a 2004 memoir about his time as a political adviser to the then foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, Le Maire had also raised eyebrows by writing about his wife touching his penis on a trip to Venice. The latest row comes amid controversy over the communications of Macron’s government after the social economy minister, Marlène Schiappa, posed for Playboy at the height of demonstrations against Macron’s pensions law. The prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, called Schiappa to tell her that it “was not at all appropriate, especially in the current period”. The leftwing daily Libération calculated that Le Maire had published more words since taking office as economy minister in 2017 than his close friend, the controversial novelist Michel Houellebecq, in the same period. Depuis 2017 et sa nomination comme ministre de l&apos;Économie, Bruno Le Maire a plus écrit que Michel Houellebecq sur la même période.

    <head>Her Way review – portrait of a sex worker shreds cinema’s cliches</head>
    <body>Sex work has been a staple topic of cinema practically since the invention of the medium, and French cinema has contributed to that corpus as much, if not more, than any other film-making nation. You might even say it’s helped to forge some of the great cinematic cliches about prostitution, going as far back as Sarah Bernhardt’s turn, adapted from a stage production, as a courtesan-with-a-heart in a 1912 adaptation of Dumas’ La Dame aux Camélias. French director Cécile Ducrocq takes some of those cliches and shreds them with her perceptive, humane film, a feature debut that’s at least partly inspired by her award-winning 2014 short Back Alley. As in the latter, Laure Calamy (best known outside France for playing lovelorn personal assistant Noémie in Call My Agent!) plays Marie, a self-described “pute” of a certain age somewhere on the other side of 35. Marie walks the streets and sees a slowly dwindling roster of regular clients, but she’s largely unashamed of her line of work, to the point that she can nonchalantly tell a bank manager that’s what she does for a living and he doesn’t even bat an eye. She’s actively involved in a sex workers’ political movement to change the law so that clients can’t get away with paying too little for their services. But her teenage son Adrien (Nissim Renard), who also knows she does sex work, is at that critical age where he needs to get a job or a college place if he’s to achieve his dream of becoming a chef. The problem is he’s in with a rum lot of peers, is doing too many drugs and has already been expelled from a state-paid course. To keep his place at a private school, Marie has to raise 5,000 euros in just a few months, which means giving up her self-employed independence to work at a club. It sometimes feels like Ducrocq didn’t quite trust that viewers would be fascinated enough by the credible, deeply plausible portrait of the milieu itself so she throws in a moral dilemma or two to up the stakes. That adds some drama but it’s not really that necessary given how mesmeric Calamy is just living in the role. But Calamy gets to show off her astonishing dynamic range as an actor, adept at comedy, anxiety, maternal rage and kittenish coquetry, all in the space of a single scene. • Her Way is released on 26 August in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema.</body>

    <head>Nobody’s Hero review – French sex satire is unsatisfying, flavourless romp</head>
    <body>Alain Guiraudie is emerging as a distinctive, perplexing, even exasperating film-maker. In a 20-year career in French cinema, he has long had a soft spot for the playful, the anarchic and the fantastical. Yet maybe we outside France were misled by his outlier hit in 2013, Stranger By the Lake. This was the film with which Guiraudie made his sensational international breakthrough: a gripping homoerotic cruising thriller. This was my own introduction to his work and perhaps it was the atypically serious tone of that which caused me to be disconcerted by the directionless silliness of his follow-up Rester Vertical, or Staying Vertical, in 2016. Now here is a semi-comic social satire or whimsy; or a jeu d’esprit whose esprit is difficult to locate. It has various themes and ideas which Guiraudie seems unable to take seriously and be successfully funny about. It is a weird caper which comports itself as realist drama, while also laboriously tipping us the wink about its obvious absurdity. The setting is Clermont-Ferrand in central France, where Médéric (Jean-Charles Clichet) is a software designer, a tubby, schlubby guy in his mid-30s who lives alone. We see him one afternoon looking entranced at a total stranger in the street with whom he has evidently fallen in love: Isadora (Noémie Lvovsky) a woman in her 50s who sells sex. He brazenly approaches her, declaring that he wants to make love to her without paying, because that is beneath him. Mystifyingly finding him sufficiently attractive to waive the fee, Isadora agrees to meet him in a scuzzy local hotel and is transported by his sexual prowess. There are some droll parts here for Yves-Robert Viala as the hotel’s elderly proprietor M Renard, and Miveck Packa as Charlène, a teenager interested in hotel management who is doing a highly unsuitable after-school job as a receptionist. Just as Médéric is reaching his climax, the whole city is blasted by a terrorist bomb, and Isadora’s hatchet-faced husband Gérard (Renaud Rutten) shows up in the hotel room and drags her away. In the new citywide paranoid mood, Médéric becomes convinced that the homeless north African kid Selim (Ilies Kadri) who is hanging around his apartment block is a terrorist. Selim becomes involved in a bizarre farcical imbroglio involving all these people, including Médéric’s colleague Florence (Doria Tillier) who also finds him very attractive. At one level, Guiraudie is signalling to us that this is all a big joke: he even has Gérard tell Médéric that he is flattered that a “hunk” like him finds his wife attractive. But what really is Nobody’s Hero about? It’s a romp, but a very flavourless romp. There are moments in which the waywardness of the movie has something Buñuelian about it, but that is more a matter of Médéric’s dreams, from which our hero must awaken in a cold sweat. Islamophobia and far-right neurosis have something to do with it, but the movie is not so much satirising these as shrugging at them. The film stands or falls by its claims to deadpan comedy – but this is heavy-handed and unsatisfying. • Nobody’s Hero screens at the Berlin film festival.</body>

    <head>French footballer Karim Benzema guilty in sex tape extortion scandal</head>
    <body>The French international footballer Karim Benzema has received a one-year suspended jail sentence and been fined €75,000 (£63,000) for his involvement in a sex tape extortion scandal that shocked French sport. A Versailles court on Wednesday found Benzema guilty of complicity in attempted blackmail against his French teammate Mathieu Valbuena over a video thought to have been stolen from Valbuena’s mobile phone. Benzema’s lawyer said the Real Madrid striker would immediately appeal against the sentence, calling it “unfair and based on no proof”. Benzema, who denied wrongdoing, had been absent from court due to sporting commitments, but his lawyers said he would be present if a second trial took place on appeal. The scandal shook French football in 2015 and the investigation and court case had cast a shadow over the national team ever since. An investigation opened in July 2015 when the midfielder Valbuena, who then played for France and Lyon, went to the police after being contacted by an unknown man claiming to be in possession of an incriminating sex tape apparently recorded on a mobile phone. The caller did not specify a sum of money but said they should come to an arrangement. Benzema, 33, was one of five people put on trial last month over the extortion attempts against Valbuena. Benzema was accused of encouraging Valbuena, 37, to deal with the blackmailers and to pay them. One intermediary was a childhood friend of Benzema’s. Benzema’s lawyer denied in court that he was complicit in blackmail, saying he had intervened only to try to help his teammate find a solution, not to blackmail him. The court found Benzema guilty of complicity in targeting Valbuena, who now plays for the Greek club Olympiakos. The judge said on Wednesday that Benzema had “personally got involved, with insistence, to try to convince Mathieu Valbuena to meet his trusted man”. The court found Benzema showed “no kindness” to Valbuena and “very much to the contrary” had acted “with a certain excitement, even jubilation”. Both Benzema and Valbuena lost their places on the national team in 2015 when the scandal broke and preliminary charges were filed. Valbuena was described at the time by his coach as not being in an emotional state to play. Benzema was recalled this year for the European Championships. State prosecutors had told the court that Benzema had a duty to be exemplary as a national footballer, carrying “an image of hope” and “moral values”. They told the court he had acted as a kind of middleman to ensure the blackmailers got the money they wanted. Valbuena told the court he had been in fear for his career. “I knew if the video came out, it would be complicated for me. I felt in danger and my first instinct was to go to the police,” he said. The court decision is unlikely to affect Benzema’s immediate sporting future. The forward is regarded as one of the favourites to win the Ballon d’Or award on 29 November in Paris after an impressive season with Real Madrid. The French Football Federation president, Noël Le Graët, has already said Benzema would be allowed to keep playing for France even if found guilty. Four other men received guilty verdicts in the case on Wednesday and were given penalties ranging from suspended prison sentences to two and a half years in jail.</body>

    <head>Sexism in France is ‘alarming’ and getting worse, says report</head>
    <body>Sexism remains at “alarming” levels in France in all areas, according to an official report that found the situation is getting worse, particularly for younger women. Women are being targeted by new forms of harassment including online violence, verbal abuse on social media and pornography with “barbaric” content, it said. The survey also detected a male “backlash” across French society to the #MeToo movement, with “macho raids” on social media seeking “to reduce women to silence or discredit them”. It stated that situations of “discrimination, violence and harassment” have reached “alarming proportions”. The study of 2,500 people by the High Authority on Equality (HCE), a consultative body, found sexist behaviour increasing in “all spheres”, with many men believing violent and discriminatory behaviour to be acceptable. Older men often remained stuck in conservative attitudes towards male and female roles in society, while younger men occasionally displayed aggressive macho tendencies, it found. Among the women aged 18-24 questioned, 22% said they had suffered “psychological control or excessive jealousy” by a partner and 15% had been beaten by their partner or ex-partner. This rose to 20% among women aged 50-64. More than one-third – 37% – of French women polled said they had been subject to non-consensual sex. When the figures were broken down, the HCE found 33% of women asked had had sex when they did not want to but their partner insisted, 12% had unprotected sex at the insistence of their partner – rising to 18% in the 25-34 age group. Of the 18- to 24-year-olds polled, 22% said they had suffered a sexual assault or rape. Despite people being aware of the violence and discrimination since the #MeToo movement “bias and gender stereotypes, sexist cliches and everyday sexism are still commonplace”, the HCE found. “People recognise and deplore the existence of sexism but fail to reject it in practice, a phenomenon particularly widespread among the men questioned. This gap between perception, statements and practice has tangible consequences in terms of symbolic, physical, sexual and economic violence. “From everyday, so-called ‘ordinary’ sexism to its most violent manifestations, there is a continuum of violence, one forming the bedrock of the others,” it read. Those questioned also spoke of a lack of confidence in official measures to combat sexism and respond “to a situation that is getting worse with new phenomenon: online violence, increased virulence on social networks, barbarity in many pornographic industry productions, and affirmation of a masculinist and antifeminist pornographic industry. “In addition, there are clear signs that women’s fundamental rights, especially sexual and reproductive rights, are being eroded in the world.” Elsewhere in the poll, 93% affirmed that men and women are treated differently in at least one of the aspects of their life: work, public space, school or family; 80% of women asked said they had been less well-treated or felt they had been because of their sex, while 37% of men said the same. Fabienne El Khoury, a spokesperson for the feminist group Osez Le Féminisme, said the situation was “depressing but not surprising”. “We see that sexism is a structural problem. It’s not just a question of discrimination in salaries and pensions or an increasing number of femicides, which are the visible part of the iceberg, but a whole mentality that needs to change,” El Khoury said. “The only way to do that is to introduce a feminist education from a young age to combat sexist stereotypes and to address pornography that is violent, misogynistic and degrading to women but that is attracting young boys at a lower and lower age.” The HCE president, Sylvie Pierre-Brossolette, said it was the first time such a survey had been done in France. “We wanted to do for sexism what has been done for racism,” Pierre-Brossolette told the Guardian. “It’s not enough to protect women and punish men. If we don’t address the roots of everyday sexism and change the mentality we will never move forward. We cannot just deplore the situation we need to change it.” She said the authorities needed to target male attitudes “from a very young age” and introduce more stringent measures to combat online sexism, violence and harassment. “Everyday sexism leads to violent sexism,” she added.</body>

    <head>Real Madrid star Karim Benzema goes on trial in sex tape case</head>
    <body>A trial is under way of the French international footballer Karim Benzema who is accused of involvement in an alleged attempt to blackmail a former teammate with a sex tape. The Real Madrid striker is accused of “complicity” in the alleged targeting of Mathieu Valbuena, who plays for the Greek Super League club Olympiacos. Investigators claim Benzema encouraged midfielder Valbuena, 37, to pay the blackmailers. Both players lost their place in France’s national team after the scandal in 2015 with Valbuena described at the time by his coach as not being in an emotional state to play. Benzema, 33, was recalled this year for the European Championship. The three-day trial from Wednesday will focus on Benzema’s role in an alleged plot by four other men to extort money from Valbuena that began when the Valbuena gave his mobile phone to Axel Angot, a man connected to footballing circles in France, and asked him to transfer its contents to a new phone. Angot is reported to have discovered sexually explicit video on the phone involving Valbuena. Prosecutors say Angot and a friend, Mustapha Zouaoui, came up with a plan to approach Valbuena and threaten to publicly release the footage unless he paid them. Prosecutors will tell the court an anonymous caller rang Valbuena in June 2015 while he was at the French team’s training centre at Clairefontaine, west of Paris, and said he wanted to “come to an arrangement” over a sex tape. Valbuena, who said he received several calls warning that the allegedly compromising film would be released, reported them to the police. Angot and Zouaoui are alleged to have eventually enlisted the help of one of Benzema’s friends, Karim Zenati, who is accused of getting Benzema’s help as a “middleman” to contact Valbuena. On 6 October 2015, four months after the calls began, Benzema allegedly went to see Valbuena and told him he could help him “manage” the possible publication of the video. Prosecutors claim Benzema was recruited by the alleged blackmailers to convince his teammate to pay up. Benzema said he acted as an intermediary to help his friend out of a difficult situation by telling him of the existence of the tape and warning him: “Be careful. These are very, very heavy criminals”. Afterwards, Benzema is alleged to have then called Zenati and told him: “He’s not taking us seriously.” The conversation was recorded by police. Valbuena said the conversation left him with the feeling he was “being played for a fool”. Benzema, who is accused of complicity in attempted blackmail, has denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer described the case against the footballer as “absurd”. The player has argued the undercover police officer used dishonest methods to draw him into the affair. His four co-accused, Angot, Zouaoui, Zenati and Youness Houass, are being tried on charges of attempted blackmail. Angot is also accused of breach of trust. Benzema, who did not appear in court, faces up to five years in jail and a €75,000 (£63,000) fine if convicted. Valbuena’s lawyer told the court he “deplored” the player’s absence that suggested he may not be taking the trial seriously. Earlier this year, Valbuena told RMC radio he believed the case had led to the end of his international career. He said: “I’d have preferred to be left out of the French team for sporting reasons … it’s true this obviously affected me greatly. When you’ve always been a good player and proudly worn the French shirt, it’s always hard to accept. I accepted it and I continued … but it’s a wound that’s difficult to get over.”</body>
